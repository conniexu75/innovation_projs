https://openalex.org/W2092426063,"We report the fabrication of transparent field-effect transistors using a single-crystalline thin-film transparent oxide semiconductor, InGaO3(ZnO)5, as an electron channel and amorphous hafnium oxide as a gate insulator. The device exhibits an on-to-off current ratio of approximately 106 and a field-effect mobility of approximately 80 square centimeters per volt per second at room temperature, with operation insensitive to visible light irradiation. The result provides a step toward the realization of transparent electronics for next-generation optoelectronics."

Twenty patients generated antibodies against β-amyloid, as determined by tissue amyloid plaque immunoreactivity assay. Patients who generated such antibodies showed significantly slower rates of decline of cognitive functions and activities of daily living, as indicated by the Mini Mental State Examination, the Disability Assessment for Dementia, and the Visual Paired Associates Test of delayed recall from the Wechsler Memory Scale, as compared to patients without such antibodies. These beneficial clinical effects were also present in two of three patients who had experienced transient episodes of immunization-related aseptic meningoencephalitis. Our results establish that antibodies against β-amyloid plaques can slow cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2136235941,"Most inverse atmospheric models report considerable uptake of carbon dioxide in Europe's terrestrial biosphere. In contrast, carbon stocks in terrestrial ecosystems increase at a much smaller rate, with carbon gains in forests and grassland soils almost being offset by carbon losses from cropland and peat soils. Accounting for non-carbon dioxide carbon transfers that are not detected by the atmospheric models and for carbon dioxide fluxes bypassing the ecosystem carbon stocks considerably reduces the gap between the small carbon-stock changes and the larger carbon dioxide uptake estimated by atmospheric models. The remaining difference could be because of missing components in the stock-change approach, as well as the large uncertainty in both methods. With the use of the corrected atmosphere- and land-based estimates as a dual constraint, we estimate a net carbon sink between 135 and 205 teragrams per year in Europe's terrestrial biosphere, the equivalent of 7 to 12% of the 1995 anthropogenic carbon emissions."
https://openalex.org/W1979344173,"We present a new technique for acquiring and analyzing intrinsic signal optical images of brain activity, using continuous stimulus presentation and data acquisition. The main idea is to present a temporally periodic stimulus and to analyze the component of the response at the stimulus frequency. Advantages of the new technique include the removal of heart, respiration, and vasomotor artifacts, a dramatic increase in spatial resolution, and a 30-fold or greater reduction in acquisition time. We also present a novel approach to localizing instantaneous neuronal responses using time-reversed stimuli that is widely applicable to brain imaging. To demonstrate the power of the technique, we present high-resolution retinotopic maps of five visual areas in mouse cortex and orientation maps in cat visual cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1485579443,"A bottleneck limiting the widespread application of semiconductor nanocrystal solids is their poor conductivity. We report that the conductivity of thin films of n -type CdSe nanocrystals increases by many orders of magnitude as the occupation of the first two electronic shells, 1S e and 1P e , increases, either by potassium or electrochemical doping. Around half-filling of the 1S e shell, a peak in the conductivity is observed, indicating shell-to-shell transport. Introducing conjugated ligands between nanocrystals increases the conductivities of these states to ∼10 – 2 siemens per centimeter."
https://openalex.org/W2029993965,"The capsaicin receptor (TRPV1), a heat-activated ion channel of the pain pathway, is sensitized by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) hydrolysis after phospholipase C activation. We identify a site within the C-terminal domain of TRPV1 that is required for PIP 2 -mediated inhibition of channel gating. Mutations that weaken PIP 2 -TRPV1 interaction reduce thresholds for chemical or thermal stimuli, whereas TRPV1 channels in which this region is replaced with a lipid-binding domain from PIP 2 -activated potassium channels remain inhibited by PIP 2 . The PIP 2 -interaction domain therefore serves as a critical determinant of thermal threshold and dynamic sensitivity range, tuning TRPV1, and thus the sensory neuron, to appropriately detect heat under normal or pathophysiological conditions."

Mice with CD2AP haploinsufficiency developed glomerular changes at 9 months of age and had increased susceptibility to glomerular injury by nephrotoxic antibodies or immune complexes. Electron microscopic analysis of podocytes revealed defects in the formation of multivesicular bodies, suggesting an impairment of the intracellular degradation pathway. Two human patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis had a mutation predicted to ablate expression of one CD2AP allele, implicating CD2AP as a determinant of human susceptibility to glomerular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2129677617,"Tau aggregation is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, and hyperphosphorylation of tau has been implicated as a fundamental pathogenic mechanism in this process. To examine the impact of cdk5 in tau aggregation and tangle formation, we crossed transgenic mice overexpressing the cdk5 activator p25, with transgenic mice overexpressing mutant (P301L) human tau. Tau was hyperphosphorylated at several sites in the double transgenics, and there was a highly significant accumulation of aggregated tau in brainstem and cortex. This was accompanied by increased numbers of silver-stained neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Insoluble tau was also associated with active GSK. Thus, cdk5 can initiate a major impact on tau pathology progression that probably involves several kinases. Kinase inhibitors may thus be beneficial therapeutically."
https://openalex.org/W2117187720,"We experimentally demonstrate emission of two quantum-mechanically correlated light pulses with a time delay that is coherently controlled via temporal storage of photonic states in an ensemble of rubidium atoms. The experiment is based on Raman scattering, which produces correlated pairs of spin-flipped atoms and photons, followed by coherent conversion of the atomic states into a different photon beam after a controllable delay. This resonant nonlinear optical process is a promising technique for potential applications in quantum communication."
https://openalex.org/W2077669265,"Interfacing semiconducting nanostructures with conducting or insulating substrates to attain a three-dimensional (3D) integrated platform is highly desirable for advanced nanoscale electronics and optoelectronics applications ( [1][1] ). As such, the assembly and synthesis of these nanostructures, which demonstrate multiple dimensionality, using a bottom-up approach would be useful. Taking ZnO as an example, we show here that high crystallinity 1D and 2D nanostructures can be epitaxially and vertically grown into 3D architectures on both conducting and insulating single crystalline substrates.

Our objective was to grow vertically well-aligned 2D and 1D semiconducting nanostructures for nanoelectronics and nanosensor applications. Using a carbothermal reduction process and gold (Au)-catalyzed epitaxial growth ( [2][2] – [4][3] ), we have been able to reproducibly grow hierachically well-ordered and vertically aligned 2D and 1D ZnO nanostructures on electrically conducting, highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and on insulating (1120) sapphire substrates. We achieve these by specifically controlling either the spacing between the catalyst spots or the thickness of the catalyst thin film.

When the Au film thickness is maintained above the threshold limit of 15 A, we obtained highly intricate quasi-3D nanostructures ([Fig. 1A][4] and inset), which are composed of an array of vertical 1D nanowires on top of a 2D network of intricate “nanowalls.” The scanning electron microscope (SEM) (top view) further reveals a random honeycomb-like pattern, resembling typical structures observed from anodization of thin-film aluminum. The nanowires are observed to grow from the “nodes” of the nanowalls. The average diameters of the nanowires and the thickness of the nanowalls are of the same order of magnitude (∼80 nm). The hexagonal facets (0001) of the nanowires ( [4][3] ) are clearly visible in the SEM images. This suggests that epitaxial growth of the nanowires occurs at the nodes of the nanowalls, which are themselves assembled epitaxially on the substrates and presumably also have their c -plane parallel to the substrates. The nanowalls have essentially vertical side wall profiles. By controlling the growth time, 2D nanowalls ([Fig. 1B][4]) could be obtained before onset of the 1D nanowires. When the catalyst thickness is kept below the threshold limit of 15 A, discrete individual free-standing 1D nanowires are obtained ([Fig. 1C][4]).

![ Fig. 1. ][5] Fig. 1. 
Zinc oxide nanowalls and nanowires. ( A ) SEM image of quasi-3D ZnO nanostructures grown on a sapphire using ∼40 to 50 A Au thin film as the catalyst. The inset shows a SEM perspective view. ( B ) 2D ZnO nanowalls on a sapphire with a height ∼5 μm. ( C ) An array of free-standing 1D ZnO nanowires on a HOPG substrate using ∼15 A Au ultrathin film as the catalyst. ( D ) Schematic illustration showing the growth mechanism of ZnO nanowalls and nanowires. The first four sketches are top views; the last, a perspective view.



Vertical growth of the ZnO nanostructures are observed as a result of the good epitaxial lattice match of the c plane of ZnO with the hexagonal basal plane of HOPG and (\batchmode \documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]{article} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amsmath} \pagestyle{empty} \begin{document} \(11{\bar{2}}0\) \end{document}) plane of sapphire. Unlike the governing mechanism in the growth of carbon nanowalls ( [5][6] ), the observed growth phenomena appear to be a result of the interplay between the dynamic wetting behavior and thermal-enhanced surface diffusion of gold adatoms on the substrates. The limited wettability between the substrate and Au film facilitates the formation of Au network patterns at an elevated temperature, in contrast to totally isolated droplets that form due to a total incompatibility or a continuous film that forms due to a complete wetting.

Control experiments with different growth durations but without ZnO and carbon feed-stock have been performed and examined under an atomic force microscope (AFM). Consistency in the AFM granulometry results has suggested aggregation of the Au nanograins forming larger particulates with narrow grain boundaries within complex channeled Au networks that resemble the 2D nanowall patterns, as depicted in [Fig. 1D][4]. We believe that, with improved wetting to the substrate, ZnO epitaxial growth is initiated along the grain boundaries because these are the most thermodynamically active sites for saturation and precipitation of the Zn atoms (green arrows). As the ZnO nanowalls continue to grow via vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism, the surface energy at the nodes increases with resultant Au atoms diffusing and accumulating at the nodes (red arrows) for overall energy compensation. At a critical saturation point, 1D nanowires begin to grow from the nodes via the same mechanism. In the 1D individual nanowire growth, the Au nanoparticles are typically well-separated and the surface diffusion length may not be extended enough to allow a continuous network formation.

Though it is well known that nanowires are useful in many electronics and optoelectronics applications, the nanowalls and high surface-to-volume ratio nanostructures with multiple dimensionality may be useful in applications in energy storage or conversion and data storage and memory devices.

To understand the molecular basis and the regulation of the process of turning intronic Alus into new exons, we compiled and analyzed a data set of human exonized Alus. We revealed a mechanism that governs 3' splice-site selection in these exons during alternative splicing. On the basis of these findings, we identified mutations that activated the exonization of a silent intronic Alu."

We determined the crystallographic structure of bovine GRK2 in complex with G protein beta1gamma2 subunits. Our results show how the three domains of GRK2-the RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) homology, protein kinase, and pleckstrin homology domains-integrate their respective activities and recruit the enzyme to the cell membrane in an orientation that not only facilitates receptor phosphorylation, but also allows for the simultaneous inhibition of signaling by Galpha and Gbetagamma subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2027215260,"Glia are the most abundant cell type in the mammalian brain. They regulate neuronal development and function, CNS immune surveillance, and stem cell biology, yet we know surprisingly little about glia in any organism. Here we identify over 40 new Drosophila glial genes. We use glial cells missing (gcm) mutants and misexpression to verify they are Gcm regulated in vivo. Many genes show unique spatiotemporal responsiveness to Gcm in the CNS, and thus glial subtype diversification requires spatially or temporally restricted Gcm cofactors. These genes provide insights into glial biology: we show unc-5 (a repulsive netrin receptor) orients glial migrations and the draper gene mediates glial engulfment of apoptotic neurons and larval locomotion. Many identified Drosophila glial genes have homologs expressed in mammalian glia, revealing conserved molecular features of glial cells. 80% of these Drosophila glial genes have mammalian homologs; these are now excellent candidates for regulating human glial development, function, or disease."
https://openalex.org/W2022513417,"Hippocampal CA1 homosynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) is expressed specifically at activated synapses. Increased insertion of postsynaptic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) appears to be crucial for CA1 LTP. However, the mechanism underlying AMPAR insertion during LTP remains largely unknown. We now report that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is complexed with AMPARs at synapses and activated by selective stimulation of synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Activation of the AMPAR-associated PI3K is required for the increased cell surface expression of AMPARs and LTP. Thus, our results strongly suggest that the AMPAR-PI3K complex may constitute a critical molecular signal responsible for AMPAR insertion at activated CA1 synapses during LTP, and consequently, this lipid kinase may serve to determine the polarity of NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity."

https://openalex.org/W2006499430,"Hypoxia initiates an intracellular signaling pathway leading to the activation of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). HIF-1 activity is regulated through different mechanisms involving stabilization of HIF-1α, phosphorylations, modifications of redox conditions, and interactions with coactivators. However, it appears that some of these steps can be cell type-specific. Among them, the involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in the regulation of HIF-1 by hypoxia remains controversial. Here, we investigated the activation state of PI3K/Akt/glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) in HepG2 cells. Increasing incubation times in hypoxia dramatically decreased both the phosphorylation of Akt and the inhibiting phosphorylation of GSK3β. The PI3K/Akt pathway was necessary for HIF-1α stabilization early during hypoxia. Indeed, its inhibition was sufficient to decrease HIF-1α protein level after 5-h incubation in hypoxia. However, longer exposure (16 h) in hypoxia resulted in a decreased HIF-1α protein level compared with early exposure (5 h). At that time, Akt was no longer present or active, which resulted in a decrease in the inhibiting phosphorylation of GSK3β on Ser-9 and hence in an increased GSK3β activity. GSK3 inhibition reverted the effect of prolonged hypoxia on HIF-1α protein level; more stabilized HIF-1α was observed as well as increased HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Thus, a prolonged hypoxia activates GSK3β, which results in decreased HIF-1α accumulation. In conclusion, hypoxia induced a biphasic effect on HIF-1α stabilization with accumulation in early hypoxia, which depends on an active PI3K/Akt pathway and an inactive GSK3β, whereas prolonged hypoxia results in the inactivation of Akt and activation of GSK3β, which then down-regulates the HIF-1 activity through down-regulation of HIF-1α accumulation.

Mammalian cells require a constant supply of oxygen to maintain adequate energy production, which is essential for maintaining normal function and for ensuring cell survival.

Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). This transcription factor binds to conserved regulatory sequences known as hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) found in the promoter of several target genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), erythropoietin, or glycolytic enzymes (aldolase A, enolase-α, etc.) and controls their expression in response to hypoxia, leading to the adaptation of cells to decreased oxygen level (2Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). Only the HIF-1α subunit is regulated by a reduced oxygen level, and the regulation occurs in large part at post-translational modifications, resulting in its stabilization, nuclear translocation, DNA binding activity, and proper transcriptional activity. Under normal conditions, HIF-1α is hydroxylated at the prolines 564 and 462 residues in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain and, hence, interacts with an E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex containing the pVHL protein (von Hippel Lindau protein) (3Ohh M.

Upon hypoxia, stabilized HIF-1α subunit translocates into the nucleus, heterodimerizes with arylhydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator, and is phosphorylated and reduced, respectively, by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (9Minet E.

The mechanism of HIF-1α degradation is becoming more and more clear, but, in addition to the proline hydroxylation of HIF-1α, other regulatory pathways have been reported to be important for the control of HIF-1α protein level by hypoxia such as the PI3K/Akt pathway (11Mazure N.M.

However, the involvement of these kinases in the regulation of HIF-1 activity remains controversial and seems to be cell type-specific, whereas their activation is not always observed in hypoxia. Many stimuli are able to activate Akt, and the common mechanism by which Akt is regulated is known. In general, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-P3 targets Akt in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Akt is phosphorylated on Ser-473 (in the regulatory domain) and Thr-308 (in the catalytic domain) by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase, an upstream kinase, resulting in enzymatic activation of Akt. Activated Akt can phosphorylate various substrates, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), a ubiquitous Ser/Thr kinase, is one of the well characterized downstream targets of this kinase (16Datta S.R.

Akt phosphorylates the two isoforms of GSK3 (α and β), respectively on Ser-21 and Ser-9; this results in an inhibition of its activity. On the other hand, GSK3 activity is up-regulated by Tyr-279/216 phosphorylation, but it is not clear whether a separate kinase regulates the phosphorylation state on this residue or whether this residue is an autophosphorylation site (19Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). GSK3 does not seem to be phosphorylated on both sites together. GSK3 has been demonstrated to regulate glycogen synthase activity and was first identified as a negative regulator of glycogen synthesis (20Orena S.J. Torchia A.J. Garofalo R.S. J. Biol.

Now GSK3 is known to phosphorylate and regulate the activation of numerous transcription factors such as c-Myc (21Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R.

A recent study performed by Sodhi et al. (26Sodhi A. Montaner S. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) reported that there was a potential consensus site in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1α for GSK3β and that this site could play a role in the regulation of HIF-1α protein stability, but no more precise data are available. In this context, the aim of this work was to determine the activation state of the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway in hypoxia in human hepatoma cells (HepG2). The second goal of the study was to elucidate the role of the PI3K/Akt pathway and of the GSK3β kinase in the regulation of HIF-1α stability and/or HIF-1 activity. The results presented here demonstrated that in HepG2 cells, the PI3K/Akt pathway is constitutively active in normoxia. This activation decreased during “early” hypoxia (5 h), but GSK3β is maintained inactive through phosphorylation of Ser-9. On the other hand, “prolonged” hypoxia (16 h) totally inactivated the PI3K/Akt pathway and hence promoted GSK3β activity. Activated GSK3β plays a role in the regulation of HIF-1α protein accumulation in hypoxia and hence seems to control the turnover of the HIF-1α protein in these conditions. HepG2 Cell Culture—Human Hepatoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 ng/ml amphotericin B. Normoxia (21% O2) and hypoxia (1% O2) incubations were performed in serum-free CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 ng/ml amphotericin B, and 10 mm glutamine. Western Blot Analysis—Total cell extracts were prepared from HepG2 grown in T25 flasks at 90% confluence. Cell medium was replaced by CO2-independent medium, and cells were exposed to 20% O2 or 1% O2 for 5 or 16 h with or without inhibitors, LY294002 (Calbiochem) at 50 μm or LiCl (Sigma) at 20 or 50 mm. After the incubation, the cells were lysed using lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5 (Merck), 150 mm KCl (Merck), 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 (Janssen Chemica), protease inhibitor (Complete®; Roche Applied Science), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture). The lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C, and the supernatant was kept frozen. Extracts were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After adequate blocking, the blot was probed with anti-HIF-1α antibodies (Transduction Laboratories; diluted 1:1000; secondary antibody was anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:2000), anti-Akt antibodies (Cell Signaling; diluted 1:1000; secondary antibody was anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences), diluted 1:2000)), anti-GSK3β antibodies (Transduction Laboratories; diluted 1:1000; secondary antibody was anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences), diluted 1:2000)), anti-phospho-Ser-21/9 GSK3α/β (Transduction Laboratories; diluted 1:1000; secondary antibody was anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences), diluted 1:2000)), and anti-phospho-Tyr-279/216 GSK3α/β (BIOSOURCE; diluted 1:1000; secondary antibody was anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences), diluted 1:2000)). Anti-α-tubulin antibodies (Innogenex; diluted 1:2000; secondary antibody was anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences), diluted 1:2000) were used to probe tubulin as a control for the total amount of proteins loaded on the gel. Chemiluminescent detection was performed using horseradish peroxidase conjugated to the secondary antibody. Transfection Experiments and Reporter Gene Assay—To assay the transcriptional activity of HIF-1, the pGL3-SV40/6HRE reporter vector containing an artificial promoter with TATA box and six copies of the erythropoietin HRE cis-element upstream of the firefly luciferase gene was used. HepG2 transfection was performed in a 24-well plate with DOTAP transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 200 ng of PGL3-SV40/6HRE. This vector was co-transfected with 100 ng of the control vector pRL-SV40 (Promega, Madison, WI) and with or without 1 μg of expression vector. Regarding the dominant negative mutant, a vector expressing a kinase-inactive mutant of GSK3 was used (27Fraser E. Young N. Dajani R. Franca-Koh J. Ryves J. Williams R.S. Yeo M. Webster M.T.

Chem. 2002; 277: 2176-2185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). pCMV-Myc was used as the empty vector. 24 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced by CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) without serum and with or without inhibitor, and cells were incubated for 16 h in normoxia or hypoxia. After the incubation, the luciferase activity was measured. Luciferase activity was quantitated in a luminometer using the Dual Luciferase Reporter System (Promega). Experiments were performed in triplicate. Results are expressed as means of the ratio between firefly luciferase activity and Renilla luciferase activity. Immunofluorescence—HepG2 cells grown on a glass coverslip were incubated in normoxia or hypoxia with or without inhibitor. After the incubation, the medium was removed, and cells were fixed 10 min with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde (Merck). The fixed cells were washed three times with PBS and permeabilized or not with a solution of PBS-Triton X-100 1% (Sigma). After three washing steps with PBS plus 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), cells were incubated at 4 °C overnight with anti-HIF-1α antibodies (diluted 1:100; Transduction Laboratories), with anti-Akt antibodies (diluted 1:100; Transduction Laboratories), with anti-phospho-Ser 473-Akt antibodies (diluted 1:50; Cell Signaling), with anti-phospho-Tyr-279/216 GSK3α/β (diluted 1:100; BIOSOURCE), or with anti-Glut-1 antibodies (diluted 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Then cells were washed three times with PBS plus 3% bovine serum albumin, and the secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa fluorochrome (488) (diluted 1:500; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were added for 1 h. The cells were then washed three times with PBS plus bovine serum albumin 3%. For nucleus labeling, the cells were incubated with Topro-3 (diluted 1:80; Molecular Probes). Finally, the cells were mounted in mowiol. Semiquantitative observations were performed with a constant photo-multiplier value using a confocal microscope (Leica). VEGF Assay—VEGF secreted in the incubation medium was assayed by an ELISA (Quantikine from R & D Systems) according to the procedure provided by the supplier. Results are expressed in ng of VEGF reported to μg of proteins assayed by the Folin method. Akt and Phospho-Ser 473 Akt Assay—Akt and phospho-Ser 473 Akt present in the cell extract were assayed by an ELISA (BIOSOURCE) according to the procedure provided by the supplier. Results are expressed in ng of Akt reported to mg of proteins assayed by the Folin method for the total of Akt and as the ratio of phospho-Akt to Akt to estimate the proportion of the phosphorylated form. GSK3 in Vitro Kinase Assay—Cells were collected by cell scraping into a lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5 (Merck), 150 mm NaCl (Merck), 1mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100 (Janssen Chemica), protease inhibitor (Complete®; Roche Applied Science), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture). Whole cell homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were transferred to fresh microcentrifuge tubes. 2.5 μg of anti-GSK3β antibodies (Transduction Laboratories) were then added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, and GSK3 was immunoprecipitated by adding 60 μl of protein A/protein G-coated Sepharose beads (Oncogene). The immunoprecipitated samples were then incubated with 20 μm cAMP-response element-binding protein synthetic phosphopeptide (Sigma) in 70 μl of reaction mixture (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)) for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was then loaded on phosphocellulose membrane Spinzyme columns (Pierce). The columns were rinsed twice with 75 mm phosphoric acid. The radioactivity associated with the columns was then measured. Results are presented in counts/min. Hypoxia Incubation of HepG2 Cells Resulted in the Inactivation of Akt—Several reports showed that hypoxia incubation induces the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in some cell lines. To investigate whether hypoxia-induced PI3K activation would result in the stimulation of the downstream Akt, HepG2 cells were exposed to hypoxia for 5 or 16 h. Active phosphorylated Akt was quantitated by a specific ELISA as well as visualized by immunofluorescence studies in confocal microscopy. An incubation of 5 h in hypoxia induced a 55% decrease in the amount of phospho-Ser-473 Akt as assayed by ELISA. This effect was even stronger (90% inhibition) after 16-h exposure in hypoxia (Fig. 1A). It has been noted that the level of phospho-Akt also decreased in normoxia but to a much lower extent. These effects were independent of the presence or absence of serum (Fig. 1A, right panel). This effect was probably due to the shift from Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to CO2-independent medium. Results obtained in immunofluorescence studies also showed a decreased in phospho-Akt under hypoxic conditions, which was more marked at 16 h than at 5 h (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that increasing incubation times in hypoxia induced a decrease in the activity of Akt. In order to confirm the role of PI3K in the activation of Akt, we used LY294002, a specific PI3K inhibitor, in normoxia and in hypoxia. The diminished phosphorylation of Akt in both conditions suggested that PI3K was an important component of Akt activation (Fig. 1, A and B). To verify that the effect of hypoxia incubation and of LY294002 treatment on Akt phosphorylation was not due to a change in the total amount of Akt protein, an ELISA for total Akt, Western blot for anti-Akt, and immunofluorescence stainings were performed. A 5-h incubation time in the presence or the absence of LY294002 in normoxia or in hypoxia did not alter the level of Akt protein (Fig. 2, A and D). However, 16-h hypoxia incubation caused an important decrease in Akt expression (Fig. 2, A–C), and PI3K inhibition did not influence this decrease (Fig. 2D). This decrease was independent of the absence or presence of serum (Fig. 2, A, right panel, and B). Altogether, these results indicate that early hypoxia decreases the activity of Akt, whereas longer incubation times also diminish the total amount of the protein. Hypoxia Decreased an Inactivating Phosphorylation of GSK3β—We then determined whether the phosphorylation state of GSK3β, a downstream target of Akt, was following the changes in Akt activity induced by hypoxia. With a kinetics similar to that of Akt activity, 16-h hypoxia incubation caused a marked decrease in the phosphorylation of GSK3β on Ser-9, whereas 5 h had a smaller effect (Fig. 3A). PI3K inhibition by LY294002 also induced a decrease in the phosphorylation of GSK3β on Ser-9. The effect of this inhibitor occurred only when cells were incubated for 5 h, probably because there remained very few active Akt at 16 h (Fig. 3, B and C). Moreover, by using an anti-phospho-Tyr216 GSK3β antibody, Western blot analysis revealed that the activated form of GSK3β was present in all conditions in the same amount. These results indicate that long duration of hypoxia incubation abolished Akt activity and thus phosphorylation of GSK3β on Ser-9. The fact that both phospho-Ser-9-GSK3β and phospho-Tyr-216-GSK3β can be detected together in cell extracts indicates that there were at least two populations of different phosphorylated forms of GSK3β. A kinase assay for GSK3β activity was performed after immunoprecipitation; an increase of 90% in GSK3 activity was observed after 16-h incubation in hypoxia in comparison with normoxia (Fig. 3C). The fact that the Tyr-216-phosphorylated form of GSK3β was present alone only after 16-h incubation in hypoxia probably explains the increase in GSK3 activity observed at that time. In addition, immunofluorescence studies revealed that the phospho-Tyr-216-GSK3β translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus after a 16-h incubation in hypoxia, hence co-localizing with HIF-1α (Fig. 3D). Effect of LiCl, a GSK3 Inhibitor, on Akt Activity and on the Expression of the Different GSK3β-phosphorylated Forms—The most common inhibitor used to inhibit GSK3β is the Li+ ion, but Chalecka-Franaszek and Chuang (28Chalecka-Franaszek E. Chuang D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8745-8750Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) described in their reports that lithium treatment can also activate Akt. Mora et al. (29Mora A. Sabio G. Risco A.M. Cuenda A. Alonso J.C. Soler G. Centeno F. Cell. Signalling. 2002; 14: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) have explained this effect by the fact that lithium inhibits the activity of protein phosphatase-2A, a phosphatase that dephosphorylates Akt. The total level of the Akt protein (Fig. 4B) as well as the level its phosphorylated form (Fig. 4A) were not affected by lithium as measured by ELISA. Western analysis showed that lithium has no effect on Akt level in hypoxia (Fig. 4C). To determine whether the effects of lithium on Akt activity can be correlated with modulation of the phosphorylation state of its target GSK3β, Western blot analysis was performed to reveal the different phosphorylation forms of GSK3β (Ser-9 and Tyr-216). Fig. 4, C and D, shows that lithium did not significantly increase GSK3β phosphorylation on Ser-9. The level of the phospho-Tyr-216 form of GSK3β was also not affected by this incubation. Effect of PI3K/Akt and GSK3 Inhibition on HIF-1α Stability and HIF-1 Activity—The previous results show that increasing incubation times in hypoxia influenced the activity of Akt, reduced the expression level of the Ser-9-phosphorylated form of GSK3β, and increased GSK3 activity. In order to study whether these modifications affect HIF-1, cells were incubated for 5 or 16 h either in normoxia or in hypoxia, and the protein level of HIF-1α was examined, as the first step in the regulation of HIF-1 activity. Fig. 5 shows whereas both short and long hypoxic incubations led to increased HIF-1α level, there was less HIF-1α at 16-h than at 5-h hypoxia. These results were independent of the absence or presence of serum. The same results were obtained when human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC-C) were incubated for 5 and 16 h in hypoxia (data not shown). This was observed both in immunofluorescence and Western blot studies. Since after prolonged hypoxia (16 h), activated GSK3β was present in HepG2 cells, we investigated whether GSK3β would play a role in the regulation of HIF-1α protein level. To test this hypothesis, LiCl, the GSK3 inhibitor, was used, and its effects on HIF-1α level were determined. After 16-h incubation in hypoxia, Li+ ion induced an increase in HIF-1α protein level in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). It has to be noted that HIF-1α stabilization in hypoxia was not affected when cells were incubated in the presence of LiCl for 5 h (Fig. 6A), which was consistent with the fact that GSK3 activity was lower, probably because the Ser-9 phosphorylated form was detected at this time. On the other hand, a 5-h incubation in the presence of LY294002 was able to inhibit HIF-1α protein accumulation in hypoxia when LY294002 relieved the Akt inhibition on GSK3β (Fig. 7A), but this effect was not observed after 16 h, when GSK3β was more active (Fig. 7B).Fig. 6Effect of GSK3 inhibition on HIF-1α expression. HepG2 cells were incubated for 5 h (A and B) or 16 h (C and D) in either normoxia or hypoxia in the presence or in the absence of LiCl at 20 or 50 mm. Cytosolic extracts were prepared and resolved by SDS-PAGE. A and C, after blotting, HIF-1α was revealed by Western analysis. A Western blot for α-tubulin was performed to check for the total amount of proteins loaded on the gel.

However, HIF-1 activation involved at least two mechanisms: regulation of HIF-1α accumulation/degradation and regulation of the actual transcriptional activity. If the HIF-1α stabilization is very important to activate HIF-1, the accumulation of HIF-1α per se (e.g. through proteasome inhibitor in normoxia) is not always sufficient for inducing HIF-1 transcriptional activity. In order to test whether GSK3β-induced regulation of HIF-1α stabilization would also regulate HIF-1 activity, we used a GSK3 dominant negative mutant (GSK3 –/–) in a reporter assay. Fig. 8A shows that the GSK3 dominant negative mutant increased luciferase activity in hypoxia. The effect of lithium was also tested, but it interfered with the expression of luciferase when using pGL3-SV40 so that the results could not properly be interpreted (data not shown). These results suggest that inhibition of GSK3 would result in an increased HIF-1 activity. HIF-1 transcriptional activity was also measured when the PI3K/Akt pathway"

The projection of motor neurons of the lateral motor column (LMC) along the dorsoventral axis of the limb mesenchyme constitutes a simple topographic map that is organized in a binary manner. We show that LIM homeodomain proteins establish motor neuron topography by coordinating the mediolateral settling position of motor neurons within the LMC with the dorsoventral selection of axon pathways in the limb. These topographic projections are established, in part, through LIM homeodomain protein control of EphA receptors and ephrin-A ligands in motor neurons and limb mesenchymal cells."

It is shown that ectopic expression of MRP8 reduces basal intracellular levels of cAMP and cGMP and enhances cellular extrusion of cyclic nucleotides in the presence or absence of stimulation with forskolin or SIN-1A. Analysis of the sensitivity of MRP8-overexpressing cells revealed that they are resistant to a range of clinically relevant nucleotide analogs, including the anticancer fluoropyrimidines 5′-fluorouracil (∼3-fold), 5′-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (∼5-fold), and 5′-fluoro-5′-deoxyuridine (∼3-fold), the anti-human immunodeficiency virus agent 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine (∼6-fold) and the anti-hepatitis B agent 9′-(2′-phosphonylmethoxynyl)adenine (PMEA) (∼5-fold). By contrast, increased resistance was not observed for several natural product chemotherapeutic agents. In accord with the notion that MRP8 functions as a drug efflux pump for nucleotide analogs, MRP8-transfected cells exhibited reduced accumulation and increased efflux of radiolabeled PMEA.

By contrast, other characterized MRP family members are able to transport a variety of lipophilic anions, such as glutathione and glucuronic acid conjugates, but not cyclic nucleotides (17Kruh G.D. Zeng H. Rea P.A. Liu G. Chen Z.-S. Lee K. Belinsky M.G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In addition to its ability to efflux cyclic nucleotides, MRP4 is also able to mediate the transport of methotrexate, reduced folates, estradiol 17-β-d-glucuronide and DHEAS (19Chen Z.-S. Lee K.

MRP8, a newly identified cDNA, was recently assigned to the MRP family based upon analyses of its predicted protein (26Bera T.K. Lee S. Salvatore G. Lee B. Pastan I.H. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 509-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Tammur J. Prades C. Arnould I. Rzhetsky A. Hutchinson A. Adachi M. Schuetz J.D. Swoboda K.J. Ptacek L.J. Rosier M. Dean M. Allikmets R.

Commun. 2001; 288: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). MRP8 resembles MRP4 and MRP5 in that it lacks a third (N-terminal) membrane-spanning domain that is present in MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, MRP6, and MRP7. In addition, sequence comparisons with MRP family members indicate that it most closely resembles MRP5 (26Bera T.K. Lee S. Salvatore G. Lee B. Pastan I.H. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 509-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Tammur J. Prades C. Arnould I. Rzhetsky A. Hutchinson A. Adachi M. Schuetz J.D. Swoboda K.J. Ptacek L.J. Rosier M. Dean M. Allikmets R. Gene. 2001; 273: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These features suggest the possibility that MRP8 might represent a component of the efflux system for cyclic nucleotides. However, the functional properties of MRP8 have not been determined with respect to either its substrate selectivity or drug resistance capabilities. Here we examine the functional characteristics of MRP8 in transfected LLC-PK1 cells. It is demonstrated that MRP8 is an efflux pump for cAMP and cGMP and that it not only is capable of conferring resistance to the purine nucleotide analog PMEA but also has the ability to function as a resistance factor for fluoropyrimidines, a widely employed class of antineoplastic agents, and the anti-AIDS drug 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine. Materials—[3H]Bis-POM-PMEA (2 Ci/mmol), [3H]5′-fluorouracil (5-FUra) (17.5 Ci/mmol), [3H]5′-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (5-FudR) (13.9 Ci/mmol), and [3H]5′-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-monophosphate ([3H]5-FdUMP) (10.7 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Moravek (Brea, CA). Unlabeled 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine (ddC), 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine, 5-FUra, 5-FdUrd, 5′-fluoro-5′-deoxyuridine (5-dFUrd), 6-thioguanine, 2′-chloro-2′-deoxyadenosine, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and vincristine were obtained from Sigma. Etoposide was obtained from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. PMEA was obtained from Gilead (Forest City, CA). 2′,3′-Dideoxy-3′-thial-cytidine was provided by the National Institutes of Health AIDS program. Forskolin and SIN-1A were obtained from the Sigma and Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI), respectively. Expression Vector Construction, Transfection, and Cell Culture—Two overlapping cDNA fragments that encode the MRP8 open reading frame were prepared by PCR using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) ready prostate library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and oligonucleotide primers derived from the reported sequence (26Bera T.K. Lee S. Salvatore G. Lee B. Pastan I.H. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 509-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were assembled into Bluescript SK(–) (Stratagene). The predicted coding sequence was identical to that reported by Berra et al. (26Bera T.K. Lee S. Salvatore G. Lee B. Pastan I.H. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 509-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MRP8 cDNA was inserted into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) to create pcDNA-MRP8. LLC-PK1 cells grown in M199 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum were electroporated with 10 μg of pcDNA-MRP8 or parental plasmid, and G418-resistant colonies were isolated. For expression in insect cells the MRP8 coding sequence was inserted into PVL1392, and production of baculovirus and infection of insect cells were accomplished according to the manufacturer's directions (Pharmingen). Generation of MRP8 Polyclonal Antibody and Immunoblot Analysis—A cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 746–804 of MRP8 was inserted downstream of the glutathione S-transferase coding sequence in PGEX2T, and the fusion protein was purified by the use of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbits were immunized with the fusion protein, and the specificity of the resulting antisera was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of cellular lysates prepared from insect cells infected with MRP8 baculovirus. Proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose filters using a wet transfer system as described previously (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar, 30Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). MRP8 was detected using polyclonal MRP8 antibody (1:500) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of Cyclic AMP and Cyclic GMP—cAMP was measured with the cAMP enzyme immunoassay system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were plated in triplicate at a density of 8000 cells/well in 96-well plates. The following day cells were lysed, and an aliquot was transferred to a second plate for the measurement of cAMP. For stimulation experiments, cells were treated with 50 μm forskolin, and cAMP measurements were performed at various time points over a 60-min time period. Extracellular cAMP was determined by subtracting intracellular cAMP from total (combined intracellular + extracellular) cAMP. cGMP levels were similarly measured using the cGMP enzyme immunoassay system (EIA, Amersham Biosciences), except that stimulation was accomplished using 50 μm SIN-1A. Analysis of Drug Sensitivity—Drug sensitivity was analyzed by the use of a tetrazolium salt microtiter plate assay (CellTiter 96 Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega, Madison, WI). Cells were seeded at a density of 5000 cells/well in 96-well dishes in complete medium, and drugs were added at various concentrations on the following day. Growth assays were performed after 72 h of growth in the presence of drugs. Accumulation and Efflux of [3H]bis-POM-PMEA—For accumulation experiments, cells were plated in triplicate at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. The next day the cells were incubated with 1 μm [3H]bis-POM-PMEA for 2 h in complete growth medium. The medium was removed, and the cells were put on ice and washed three times with 2 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Trypsin solution (0.2 ml) was applied to the plates, and the cell suspension was added to 4 ml of scintillation fluid. For efflux experiments, cells were plated in triplicate in 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well. The next day drug accumulation was accomplished by growth for 2 h in ATP-depletion medium consisting of glucose-free, pyruvate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm deoxyglucose, 10 mm sodium azide, and 1 μm [3H]bis-POM-PMEA. After accumulation, the cells were washed quickly with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with prewarmed complete medium lacking drug. Aliquots of medium were obtained over a 2-h efflux period. Preparation of Membrane Vesicles and Transport Experiments—Membrane vesicles were prepared by the nitrogen cavitation method (31Cornwell M.M. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7921-7928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and transport experiments were performed using the rapid filtration method essentially as described previously (32Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27807-27810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transport experiments were carried out in medium containing membrane vesicles (10 μg), 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 100 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and radio-labeled compounds ± unlabeled compounds, in a total volume of 50 μl. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of 3 ml of ice-cold stop solution (0.25 m sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) Samples were passed through 0.22-μm Durapore membrane filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA) under vacuum. The filters were washed three times with 3 ml of ice-cold stop solution and dried at room temperature for 30 min. Rates of net ATP-dependent transport were determined by subtracting the values obtained in the presence of 4 mm AMP from those obtained in the presence of 4 mm ATP. Ectopic Expression of MRP8 in LLC-PK1 Cells—To characterize the functional properties of MRP8, a cellular model was generated by transfecting LLC-PK1 cells with MRP8 expression vector. Immunoblot analysis indicated that MRP8 protein was expressed in several of the resulting G418-selected clones, as indicated by the intensely immunoreactive bands present in three clones transfected with MRP8 vector, but not in the parental vector-transfected control cells (Fig. 1). The apparent molecular weight of MRP8 (∼170,000–190,000) was higher than its calculated molecular mass (154 kDa) and the apparent molecular weight of the protein expressed in insect cells (∼155,000, data not shown), as would be expected for a glycosylated transmembrane protein. Two of these clones were selected for functional studies on MRP8. Cellular Efflux of Cyclic Nucleotides by MRP8 —To determine whether MRP8 is capable of extruding cyclic nucleotides from cells, intracellular cAMP levels were analyzed before and after stimulation with forskolin. Basal cAMP levels in the MRP8-transfected cells were consistently lower than those of the parental vector control cells (Table I). The intracellular levels in LLC-PK1-MRP8-1 and LLC-PK1-MRP8-2 cells were 4.7 ± 2.1 pmol/106 cells and 4.3 ± 2.7 pmol/106 cells, respectively, in comparison with the control cells in which the level was 6.6 ± 3.1 pmol/106 cells. These values corresponded to reductions of 29 and 35% for LLC-PK1-MRP8-1 and LLC PK1-MRP8-2, respectively. Reduced cAMP levels were also observed for the MRP8-transfected cells after stimulation with forskolin. After 30 min of stimulation with 50 μm forskolin, the cAMP levels in LLC-PK1-MRP8-1 and LLC-PK1-MRP8-2 were 34 and 18% lower than the levels in control cells (Table I).Table IIntracellular cAMP levels in MRP8-transfected LLC-PK1 cellsTreatmentLLC-PK1-pcDNALLC-PK1-MRP8-1LLC-PK1-MRP8-2pmol/106 cellspmol/106 cellspmol/106 cellsNone6.6 ± 3.14.7 ± 2.1aValues are significantly different (p < 0.05) from the corresponding control transfectant values as determined by the two-tailed nonparametric Wilcoxon test.4.3 ± 2.7aValues are significantly different (p < 0.05) from the corresponding control transfectant values as determined by the two-tailed nonparametric Wilcoxon test.Forskolin210 ± 110138 ± 93aValues are significantly different (p < 0.05) from the corresponding control transfectant values as determined by the two-tailed nonparametric Wilcoxon test.173 ± 98aValues are significantly different (p < 0.05) from the corresponding control transfectant values as determined by the two-tailed nonparametric Wilcoxon test.a Values are significantly different (p < 0.05) from the corresponding control transfectant values as determined by the two-tailed nonparametric Wilcoxon test. Open table in a new tab Separate experiments were performed to analyze the appearance of cAMP in the medium following forskolin stimulation. Cellular extrusion was significantly greater for the MRP8-transfected cells at each of the time points examined (Fig. 2). At the 15-min time point, the cAMP levels in the medium of control and LLC-PK1-MRP8-1 cells were 42.9 and 108 pmol/106 cells, respectively. A comparable increment attributable to MRP8 was present at the 45-min time point, at which time the extracellular cAMP level was 178 pmol/106 cells for LLC-PK1-MRP8-1 in comparison with 68.3 pmol/106 for the control cells. Hence, at the 15- and 45-min time points the cAMP levels were 2.5- and 2.6-fold higher in the medium of the MRP8-transfected cells. To assess the capabilities of MRP8 with regard to cGMP, intracellular and extracellular levels were measured before and after stimulation with SIN-1A. As shown in Table II, the intracellular cGMP levels were 2.0 ± 0.8 and 1.3 ± 0.6 pmol/106 cells, and the extracellular levels were 4.3 ± 1.8 and 5.0 ± 1.2 pmol/106 cells, respectively, for control cells and LLC-PK1-MRP8-1 cells. Thus the intracellular and extracellular cGMP levels in MRP8-transfected cells were, respectively, 35% lower and 16% higher than control cells. Following 30 min of stimulation with SIN-1A; the intracellular cGMP levels were 9.0 ± 4.5 and 5.1 ± 1.8 pmol/106 cell, and the extracellular levels were 26.1 ± 3.2 and 32.4 ± 5.1 pmol/106 cell, respectively, for the control cells and LLC-PK1-MRP8-1 cells (Table II). Hence, following stimulation, the intracellular cGMP level in LLC-PK1-MRP8-1 cells was 43% lower than the control cells, and the extracellular levels were 24% higher than the control cells. In combination, these experiments showed that expression of MRP8 results in consistent, but modest, depression in intracellular cAMP and cGMP levels, and enhancement of cyclic nucleotide extrusion.Table IIIntracellular and extracellular cGMP levels of LLC-PK1-MRP8-1 cellsTreatmentLLC-PK1-pcDNALLC-PK1 MRP8-1IntracellularExtracellularIntracellularExtracellularpmol/106 cellspmol/106 cellsNone2.0 ± 0.84.3 ± 1.81.3 ± 0.6aValues are significantly different (p < 0.05) from the corresponding control transfectant values as determined by the two-tailed nonparametric Wilcoxon test.5.0 ± 1.2aValues are significantly different (p < 0.05) from the corresponding control transfectant values as determined by the two-tailed nonparametric Wilcoxon test.SIN-1A9.0 ± 4.526.1 ± 3.25.1 ± 1.8aValues are significantly different (p < 0.05) from the corresponding control transfectant values as determined by the two-tailed nonparametric Wilcoxon test.32.4 ± 5.1aValues are significantly different (p < 0.05) from the corresponding control transfectant values as determined by the two-tailed nonparametric Wilcoxon test.a Values are significantly different (p < 0.05) from the corresponding control transfectant values as determined by the two-tailed nonparametric Wilcoxon test. Open table in a new tab Analysis of the Drug Sensitivity of MRP8-transfected LLC-PK1 Cells—MRP8-transfected cells exhibited increased resistance toward clinically relevant purine and pyrimidine nucleotide analogs (Table III). LLC-PK1-MRP8-1 cells were 5.4-fold resistant to the purine nucleotide analog PMEA but did not exhibit increased resistance toward three other purine nucleotide analogs, 6-thioguanine, 2′-chloro-2′-deoxyadenosine, and deoxycorfomycin. In addition, LLC-PK1-MRP8-1 cells were 6.1-fold resistant to the antiviral pyrimidine analog ddC and 2.9-fold resistant to the anticancer pyrimidine analog 5-FUra. Increased resistance was also observed for two other fluoropyrimidines of clinical significance, 5-FdUrd (5.2-fold), a ribosylated intracellular metabolite of 5-FUra, which like 5-FUra is employed as an intravenous agent, and 5-dFUrd (3.4-fold), a metabolite of the oral fluoropyrimidine capecitabine, which is further metabolized in the cell to 5-FUra. Small decreases in the sensitivity of LLC-PK1-MRP8-1 cells were observed for the pyrimidine nucleotide analogs 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thial-cytidine and 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. Representative growth curves for PMEA, ddC, and 5-FUra are shown in Fig. 3. Increased resistance was not detected for several natural product anticancer agents, including vincristine, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and etoposide (Table III). A similar drug resistance phenotype was observed for LLC-PK1-MRP8-2, which exhibited 5.6-, 7.1-, 4.1-, 3.2-, and 2.5-fold resistance toward PMEA, ddC, 5-FUra, 5-FudR, and 5-dFUrd, respectively (p values < 0.05; data not shown).Table IIIDrug sensitivity analysis of MRP8-transfected LLC-PK1 cellsAgentIC50-Fold resistanceLLC-PK1-pcDNALLC-PK1-MRP8-1μ mPMEA457 ± 792463 ± 3865.4aValues are significantly different from the control transfectant (p < 0.05) as determined by the nonparametric two-tailed Wilcoxon test.6-TG500 ± 41546 ± 1001.1CdA8.1 ± 2.78.2 ± 4.61.0DCF256 ± 52263 ± 501.03TC869 ± 561078 ± 481.4AZT507 ± 86639 ± 411.3ddC384 ± 522430 ± 1556.1aValues are significantly different from the control transfectant (p < 0.05) as determined by the nonparametric two-tailed Wilcoxon test.5-FUra8.8 ± 3.026.2 ± 122.9aValues are significantly different from the control transfectant (p < 0.05) as determined by the nonparametric two-tailed Wilcoxon test.5-FdUrd20.3 ± 9.0105 ± 395.2aValues are significantly different from the control transfectant (p < 0.05) as determined by the nonparametric two-tailed Wilcoxon test.5-dFUrd29.0 ± 8.698.7 ± 353.4aValues are significantly different from the control transfectant (p < 0.05) as determined by the nonparametric two-tailed Wilcoxon test.VCR0.09 ± 0.010.10 ± 0.021.1Taxol0.35 ± 0.070.37 ± 0.051.1DOX0.42 ± 0.030.45 ± 0.11.1ETOP0.92 ± 0.041.21 ± 0.101.2a Values are significantly different from the control transfectant (p < 0.05) as determined by the nonparametric two-tailed Wilcoxon test. Open table in a new tab Analysis of PMEA Accumulation and Efflux—The effect of MRP8 on the cellular kinetics of a representative agent was analyzed. To this end we employed bis-POM-PMEA, an uncharged bis-ester prodrug of PMEA that is more effective than the parent compound in crossing the plasma membrane (33Starrett Jr., J.E. Tortolani D.R. Russell J. Hitchcock M.J. Whiterock V. Martin J.C. Mansuri M.M. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Once inside the cell the pivaloyloxymethyl moiety of bis-POM-PMEA is cleaved to release free PMEA. LLC-PK1-MRP8-1 exhibited reduced accumulation of [3H]bis-POM-PMEA compared with parental vector-transfected cells (Fig. 4A). After 15 min of incubation in growth medium containing 1 μm [3H]bis-POM-PMEA, drug accumulation in LLC-PK1-MRP8-1 cells was ∼60% of the control cells. This difference in accumulation was maintained throughout the time course of the assay. Separate efflux experiments were performed under conditions in which initial intracellular drug levels were comparable in the two cell lines, by first allowing accumulation of 1 μm [3H]bis-POM-PMEA to proceed under energy-depletion conditions. Following a 2-h incubation period, the growth medium was replaced with complete medium lacking drug, and efflux of radiolabeled drug into the medium was measured. As shown in Fig. 4B, LLC-PK1-MRP8-1 exhibited enhanced drug efflux by comparison with the control cells. At the 2-h time point, efflux by the MRP8-transfected cells was 40% greater than the control cells. Transport of 5′-Fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine Monophosphate—By contrast with cyclic nucleotides and PMEA, both of which are amphipathic anions, 5-FUra is an uncharged pyrimidine analog. The possibility that MRP8 confers resistance to this agent, as well as to 5-FdUrd and 5-dFUrd, by transporting 5-FdUMP, the anionic cytotoxic metabolite of these compounds as opposed to the parent compounds, was therefore considered. This was examined by analyzing the ability of the pump to transport 5-FUra, 5-FudR, and 5-FdUMP into inside-out membrane vesicles. As shown in Fig. 5, although membrane vesicles prepared from parental vector transfected cells were able to catalyze the MgATP-dependent transport of [3H]5-FdUMP, an increment attributable to MRP8 was consistently observed. MgATP-dependent uptake for LLC-PK1-MRP8-1 and LLC-PK1-MRP8-2 was 15.4 and 21.0 pmol/mg/10 min, respectively, whereas uptake for the control membranes was only 7.3 pmol/mg/10 min (Fig. 5). By contrast, with [3H]5-FdUMP, MgATP-dependent uptake of [3H]5-FUra and [3H]5-FdUrd was negligible for both MRP8-enriched and control membrane vesicles. In the present study the functional properties of MRP8 were analyzed by the use of transfected LLC-PK1 cells. In combination, the results showing that MRP8 is able to depress intracellular levels of cAMP and cGMP by enhancing cellular extrusion, confer resistance to PMEA, and transport 5-FdUMP provide the first evidence that this protein functions as a lipophilic anion pump. These results indicate that the cellular extrusion of cyclic nucleotides, a phenomenon that has been well documented in numerous types of mammalian cells, is accomplished by a plasma membrane system that is composed of at least three pumps. Although its substrates have yet be determined, the high degree of structural resemblance between MRP9 and MRP8 (27Tammur J. Prades C. Arnould I. Rzhetsky A. Hutchinson A. Adachi M. Schuetz J.D. Swoboda K.J. Ptacek L.J. Rosier M. Dean M. Allikmets R. Gene. 2001; 273: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 28Yabuuchi H. Shimizu H. Takayanagi S. Ishikawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) suggests that it may also participate in this process. Although cellular extrusion of cyclic nucleotides from mammalian cells is a well established phenomenon, it has not been considered a major factor in attenuating the elevation of these second messengers consequent to the activation of cyclases. This process is thought to be mediated primarily by the action of phosphodiesterases, a view based upon the notion that an extremely rapid, high capacity system is required for the precise time-sensitive signaling mediated by cyclic nucleotides. By comparison with the enzymatic breakdown of cyclic nucleotides by phosphodiesterases, cellular efflux is thought to be low capacity, and more importantly, relatively slow. The identification of efflux pumps capable of mediating this process (this study and Refs. 18Jedlitschky G. Burchell B. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30069-30074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar and 19Chen Z.-S. Lee K. Kruh G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33747-33754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) has provided the molecular tools to investigate directly their involvement in these and related processes. The results, showing that intracellular levels of cAMP and cGMP under basal or stimulated conditions were only modestly depressed (1.2–1.8-fold) by ectopic expression of MRP8, tend to support the view that efflux pumps are not potent attenuation factors, as do previous reports showing that ectopic expression of MRP4 and MRP5 is similarly associated with modest effects on intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels (34Lai L.

These studies, in combination with measurements showing that the latter two pumps have reasonably high affinities for cGMP, and in the case of MRP4, for cAMP (18Jedlitschky G. Burchell B. Keppler D.

Further studies should help to determine the circumstances and extent to which efflux pumps participate in intracellular cyclic nucleotide homeostasis and also to define their involvement in the physiological processes in which extruded cyclic nucleotides have been proposed as primary messengers. Analysis of the drug sensitivity of MRP8-transfected LLC-PK1 cells showed that MRP8 is able to confer resistance to fluoropyrimidines, ddC, and PMEA. However, resistance toward 6-thioguanine, an agent that is part of the resistance profiles of MRP4 and MRP5, was not detected (19Chen Z.-S. Lee K. Kruh G.D. J. Biol.

Fluoropyrimidines, which are a mainstay in the treatment of colon cancer and are also active in breast and head and neck cancer, are among the most widely employed anticancer agents. The cytotoxicity of 5-FUra is mediated predominately by its intracellular metabolite, 5-FdUMP, which in combination with 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate forms a stable inhibitory complex with thymidylate synthase. The biochemical consequences of this block, depletion of thymidine nucleotides and build-up of dUTP, engender impaired DNA synthesis and misincorporation of uracil into DNA, respectively. Cellular resistance factors for fluoropyrimidines include increased expression of thymidylate synthase, decreased expression of enzymes involved in metabolic activation, and increased expression of dUTPase (36Copur S.

Our results indicate that MRP8 is a potential clinical resistance factor for fluoropyrimidines and that it confers resistance to this class of agents by mediating the efflux of 5-FdUMP, the intracellular cytotoxic metabolite of 5-FUra, 5-FudR, and the oral fluoropyrimidine capecitabine (Fig. 6). The presence of significant levels of 5-FdUMP transport by membranes prepared from control LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 5), in which MRP8 is barely detectable (Fig. 1), suggests that pumps other than MRP8 may also be involved in this process. Although, to the best of our knowledge, increased efflux of fluoropyrimidine metabolites has not been described in drug-resistant cell lines, this potential mechanism warrants more detailed analysis in view of our findings. The ability of MRP8 to confer resistance to the anti-AIDS nucleotide analog ddC is also noteworthy. We infer that this activity is consequent to the efflux of the intracellular nucleotide metabolites of this agent, by analogy with the mechanisms by which MRP8 confers resistance to fluoropyrimidines, and MRP4 and MRP5 confer resistance to and 6-mercaptopurine (42Wielinga P.R. Reid G. Challa E.E. van der Heijden I. van Deemter L. de Haas M. Mol C. Kuil A.J. Groeneveld E. Schuetz J.D. Brouwer C. De Abreu R.A. Wijnholds J. Beijnen J.H. Borst P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1321-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Investigations of clinical resistance to ddC have focused primarily on mutations in the human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase and alterations in the levels of cellular metabolizing enzymes (43Fitzgibbon J.E.

Our results suggest that cellular efflux is a potential clinical resistance for this agent. A recent study showing that a drug-resistant cell line in which ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)) is over-expressed is cross-resistant to 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine suggests that ABC transporters that are not MRP family members may also be involved in resistance to this class of agents (44Wang X. Furukawa T. Nitanda T. Okamoto M. Sugimoto Y. Akiyama S. Baba M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), although this remains to be confirmed in experiments using recombinant ABCG2. Analysis of the expression of MRP8 in clinical samples should help to determine its importance in clinical resistance to fluoropyrimidines, ddC, and the anti-hepatitis B agent PMEA."

Here, we report the identification of two new phosphorylation sites in the α-subunit, viz. Thr258 and Ser485 (Ser491 in the α2-subunit) by mass spectrometry, in addition to the previously characterized Thr172 site. Also, autophosphorylation sites in the β1-subunit were identified as Ser96, Ser101, and Ser108. Mutagenesis of Thr172, Thr258, and Ser485 to acidic residues to mimic phosphorylation in the recombinant proteins indicated that Thr172 was involved in AMPK activation, whereas Thr258 and Ser485 were not. Transfection of the non-phosphorylatable S485A and T258A mutants in CCL13 cells subjected to stresses known to activate AMPK either by increasing the AMP:ATP ratio (slow lysis) or without changing adenine nucleotide concentrations (hyperosmolarity) resulted in no significant differences in AMPK activation. All three sites within the α-subunit were phosphorylated in vivo, as seen in AMPK immunoprecipitated from anoxic rat liver. In transfected CCL13 cells, the level of Ser485 phosphorylation did not change upon AMPK activation.

AMPK is activated by changes in the AMP:ATP ratio, although activation of AMPK has been observed in response to stimuli that do not change intracellular adenine nucleotide concentrations (4Fryer L.G.

Under stress conditions, for example, during anoxia or exercise-induced skeletal muscle contraction, the ATP:ADP ratio falls, and there is a subsequent rise in intracellular AMP (5Hardie D.G.

Vincent M.-F. Van den berghe G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1290: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Once activated, AMPK acts to down-regulate ATP-consuming pathways such as fatty acid synthesis by phosphorylating and inactivating acetyl-CoA carboxylase (11Davies S.P. Sim A.T.R. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and protein synthesis by promoting the phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (12Horman S. Browne G.J. Krause U.

AMPK also activates pathways involved in ATP production. For example, in heart, AMPK activation stimulates glycolysis by increasing glucose uptake (13Russell III, R.R. Bergeron R. Shulman G.I. Young L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H643-H649PubMed Google Scholar) and by activating 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (14Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Rider M.H. Deprez J. Beauloye C. Vincent M.-F.

In yeast, the AMPK homolog Snf1 kinase is activated by low glucose concentrations and increases the transcription of genes for growth on alternative carbon sources (2Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 82-855Crossref Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Therefore, AMPK can be regarded as both an energy and a nutrient sensor. AMPK is a heterotrimer consisting of a catalytic α-subunit and two regulatory subunits, β and γ. Each subunit exists as multiple isoforms (α1, α2, β1, β2, γ1, γ2, and γ3), giving 12 different possible combinations of holoenzyme with different tissue distribution and subcellular localization (2Hardie D.G.

Sci. 1999; 24: 22-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). AMPK is allosterically stimulated by AMP and is itself regulated by phosphorylation via an upstream AMPK kinase (AMPKK) (2Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev.

The major regulatory phosphorylation site has been identified as Thr172 within the activation loop between the DFG and APE motifs of the α-subunits (15Hawley S.A. Davison M. Woods A. Davies S.P.

Site-directed mutagenesis showed that phosphorylation at Thr172 accounts for most of the activation of AMPK by AMPKK, but that other sites were implicated (19Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The native β1-subunit was found to be phosphorylated in vivo at Ser24/Ser25, Ser108, and Ser182 (16Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J House C.M. Stapleton D. Dyck J. Gamble J. Ullrich C. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24475-24479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutation of Ser108 to alanine leads to the inhibition of AMPK, whereas the S24A/S25A and S182A mutants have no effect on activity, but lead to the nuclear redistribution of the holoenzyme (20Warden S.M. Richardson C. O'Donnell Jr., J.B. Stapleton D. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). AMPK autophosphorylates mainly on the β-subunits (21Chen Z. Heierhorst J. Mann R.J. Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J. Witters L.A. Lynch G.S. Kemp B.E. Stapleton D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), but these sites have not been identified. Here, we have used recently available bacterially expressed AMPK heterotrimers (22Neumann, D., Woods, A., Carling, D., Wallimann, T., and Schlattner, U. (2003) Protein Expression Purif., in pressGoogle Scholar) together with mass spectrometry to investigate phosphorylation of the kinase by an AMPKK preparation. By comparing the phosphorylation of the wild-type complex with that of a catalytically inactive mutant complex (D157A in the α1-subunit) (19Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), we were able to distinguish between autophosphorylation sites and AMPKK phosphorylation sites. This approach allowed us to identify, in addition to Thr172, two new AMPKK phosphorylation sites in the α-subunit and three autophosphorylation sites in the β1-subunit. Materials—The protease inhibitor mixture was from Sigma. Sequencing-grade trypsin and chymotrypsin were from Promega and Roche Diagnostics, respectively. All other materials were from ICN or Sigma. HPLC-grade solvents and acids were from Acros Organics. Anti-phospho-Thr172 α-subunit antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-phospho-Ser485 α-subunit antibody was kindly provided by Prof. Grahame Hardie (University of Dundee). The antibody was raised in sheep against the peptide PQRSCpSAA-GLHR plus an N-terminal cysteine for coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 was obtained from Sigma. Expression and Purification of Recombinant AMPK—Expression and purification of wild-type and mutant AMPKs in bacteria were carried out as described (22Neumann, D., Woods, A., Carling, D., Wallimann, T., and Schlattner, U.

(2003) Protein Expression Purif., in pressGoogle Scholar). All other mutations were introduced directly into pγ1β1His-α1 by unique site-directed mutagenesis, which allows selection by simultaneous introduction of the mutation together with a new unique restriction site (23Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 8-88Crossref Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). With the first mutation (T172E, T258D, or S485D) in wild-type pγ1β1His-α1, the unique NheI site was exchanged with a unique KpnI site, whereas the double mutant T172E/S485D was obtained from the single mutant T172E vector with KpnI reverted to NheI, and the triple mutant from the double mutant vector by reverting again to KpnI. Mutagenic primers were synthesized by Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland) and are listed in Table I. The complete AMPK coding region of all plasmids was sequenced to verify the newly introduced mutations and the absence of random mutations utilizing the BigDye™ terminator cycle sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) in an Applied Biosystems Prism 310 Sequencer according to the manufacturer's instructions.Table INucleotide sequences of the primers used for unique site mutagenesisPrimerSequenceSelection primersNheI → KpnI (elimination of a NheI site and introduction of a KpnI site)5′-CAA CGC ATA TAG CGG TAC CAG CAC GCC ATA G-3′KpnI → NheI (elimination of a KpnI site and introduction of a NheI site)5′-CAA CGC ATA TAG CGC TAG CAG CAC GCC ATA G-3′Mutagenesis primersα1-T172E5′-GGT GAA TTT TTA AGA GAG AGC TGT GGC TCG CCC AAT TAT G-3′α1-T258D5′-CCT ATG AAG AGG GCC GAT ATA AAA GAT ATC AGG-3′α1-S485D5′-CCA CAG AGA TCG GGA GAC ATC AGC AAC TAT CG-3′ Open table in a new tab Phosphorylation of Bacterially Expressed AMPK Heterotrimers by AMPKK—Purified recombinant AMPK (2–50 μg) was incubated in the presence or absence of a preparation of AMPKK (0.8–10 μg) partially purified from rat liver up to the Q-Sepharose step as described previously (15Hawley S.A.

Spectra were taken in full MS and Zoom scan mode to determine parent ion monoisotopic masses and their charge states. The source voltage was set at 0.8 kV, and the collision-induced dissociation energy was adjusted to the minimum needed for fragmentation. Phosphopeptides were identified in MS2 mode by the loss of H3PO4 (98 Da) under low collision-induced dissociation energy, and the phosphorylated residue was pinpointed in MS3 mode. In some cases, radioactive peaks were further purified for Edman sequencing (30Rider M.H. Van Damme J. Vertommen D. Michel A. Vandekerckhove J. Hue L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For in vivo phosphorylation site analysis, AMPK was immunoprecipitated from anoxic rat liver with anti-α1- or α2-AMPK antibodies (31Woods A. Salt I. Scott J. Hardie D.G. Carling D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and subjected to electrophoresis in SDS gels containing 10% (w/v) acrylamide. Protein bands were excised from the gel, concentrated, and digested as described above for on-line capillary HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 PepMap capillary column (0.3 mm × 25 cm; LC Packings) as described (29Vertommen D. Rider M.H. Ni Y. Waelkens E. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J. Van Lint J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19567-19576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For phosphorylation site mapping, the mass spectrometer was operated in fully automated mode with an ion source at 4.8 kV using a data-dependent acquisition routine. This routine consisted of a full MS scan, followed by a high resolution Zoom scan and a full MS/MS scan of the most intense ion selected from the previous MS spectrum. Normalized collision-induced dissociation energy was set at 28%, and dynamic exclusion ensured collection of data on coeluting peptides. After data acquisition, a specific ion chromatogram based on the phosphopeptide masses observed in vitro was extracted from the total ion chromatogram. If a peak was observed in this chromatogram, the identity of the phosphopeptide was confirmed in the Zoom and MS/MS scans. Immunoblotting—The amounts of protein indicated in the figure legends were separated by SDS-PAGE in 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 0.5 m NaCl) with 5% (w/v) low fat milk powder. The membrane was incubated with various dilutions of primary antibody in the same buffer for 2–16 h. After extensive washing with Tris-buffered saline, the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. After further extensive washing with Tris-buffered saline, the blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). For quantitation of AMPK phosphorylation, the blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using a 16-bit CCD cooled camera (Gene Gnome, Syngene, Cambridge, UK). Quantification was achieved using GeneTools software (Syngene). Activation of Bacterially Expressed AMPK—Purified recombinant AMPK (0.1 μg) was activated with the preparation of AMPKK (0.8 μg) in buffer consisting of 5 mm MgCl2 in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 0.1 mm ATP for 30 min at 37 °C (in the presence or absence of 0.2 mm AMP, as described in the figure legends). Samples were diluted in assay buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) and assayed for AMPK activity by phosphorylation of the SAMS peptide (32Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) using 0.2 mm [γ-32P]MgATP (specific radioactivity of 200 cpm/pmol). Partially purified AMPK from anoxic rat liver purified up to the DEAE-Sepharose step as described previously (24Carling D. Clarke P.R. Zammit V.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) was also assayed by phosphorylation of the SAMS peptide. Transient Transfection of CCL13 Cells and Measurement of AMPK Activity—Plasmid DNA was prepared using a QIAGEN maxiprep kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. CCL13 cells were cotransfected with cDNA (10 μg of plasmid) encoding the wild-type α1-subunit, S485A, or T258A and the β1- and γ1-subunits (all cDNAs cloned into pcDNA3) by calcium phosphate precipitation (33Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). The α1-subunit cDNAs encode an N-terminal Myc epitope tag (EQKLISEEDL) (34Evans G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar), and the γ1-subunit cDNA encodes an N-terminal FLAG epitope (DYKD-DDDK). Cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection by one of two methods (rapid or slow lysis) (35Daniel T. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 629-638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AMPK activity was determined in immune complexes isolated by immunoprecipitation from cell lysates using anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (clone 9E10) (34Evans G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). The lysate volume was normalized according to the amount of expression of the γ-subunit, as assessed by quantitation of blots probed with anti-FLAG antibody. Cell lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with anti-Myc antibody bound to protein G-Sepharose. Immune complexes were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 1 min and washed with lysis buffer prior to assay. AMPK activity was measured as described above. Activities are expressed as nanomoles of phosphate incorporated into the SAMS peptide/min/ml of cell lysate. Phosphorylation of Recombinant AMPK—Phosphorylation of AMPK by both autophosphorylation and AMPKK was investigated by [32P]phosphate incorporation from [γ-32P]ATP into the α1-, β1-, and γ1-subunits of wild-type, catalytically inactive (α1-D157A), and constitutively active (α1-T172E) AMPKs. Fig. 1A shows the Coomassie Blue-stained gel, and Fig. 1B shows the corresponding autoradiogram of the repurified AMPK complexes. That the D157A mutant was catalytically inactive was confirmed by the fact that there was no phosphorylation of its AMPK subunits in the absence of AMPKK. Incubation of the D157A mutant with AMPKK led to phosphorylation of the α-subunit, which was apparently insensitive to AMP (see below). For the D157A mutant, there was no phosphorylation of the β-subunits, even in the presence of AMPKK, suggesting that phosphorylation of the β-subunits represents autophosphorylation. Phosphorylation of the wild-type AMPK complex was very low in the absence of AMPKK. In the presence of AMPKK, both the α- and β-subunits were phosphorylated. The T172E mutant underwent autophosphorylation of the α-subunit and, to a lesser extent, of the β-subunit in the absence of AMPKK and AMP. However, autophosphorylation of the β-subunit was enhanced in the presence of AMP, reflecting an increased enzymatic activity of the T172E mutant. The α-subunit of the T172E mutant was further phosphorylated by AMPKK, implying the existence of additional sites on the α-subunit for AMPKK other than Thr172. However, β-subunit phosphorylation remained unchanged. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation in all cases was rather low. For example, for phosphorylation by AMPKK, 32P incorporation was ∼0.5 mol of phosphate/mol of D157A mutant. The reason for such a low incorporation is not clear. Identification of Phosphorylation Sites for AMPKK in the AMPK α-Subunits—Bacterially expressed wild-type and catalytically inactive (α1-D157A) AMPK heterotrimers were incubated with purified AMPKK and [γ-32P]ATP as described above. The α1- and α2-subunits were separated by SDS-PAGE and concentrated in agarose for digestion with trypsin or chymotrypsin. The resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC. Tryptic digestion of the α1- and α2-subunits gave rise to four major radiolabeled peaks (labeled –4 in Fig. 2), with peak 1 appearing in the flow-through fractions. Chymotryptic digestion gave rise to two major radioactive peaks (data not shown). These peaks were absent when AMPK was incubated without AMPKK and therefore represent sites for the upstream kinase rather than autophosphorylation. No differences in the HPLC profiles were observed between wild-type and catalytically inactive AMPKs (Fig. 2), although some minor radioactive peaks were absent in the latter and probably contain autophosphorylation sites. Similar results were obtained in six separate experiments with different preparations of both AMPK and AMPKK, except that the distribution and extent of radioactivity between peaks were somewhat variable. Each radioactive fraction was screened for phosphopeptides by neutral loss of H3PO4 (98 Da) by nano-ESI-MS/MS. Peak 2 (Fig. 2) contained a phosphopeptide of [M + 2H+]2+ = 482.4, whose mass decreased to 433.2 Da upon low energy collision (Fig. 3A), consistent with a single phosphate addition to a predicted tryptic fragment of the α1-subunit (P1 in Table II). The difference of 98 Da corresponds to the loss of H3PO4 via β-elimination, leaving dehydroalanine in place of the phosphorylated serine residue (36DeGnore J.P. Qin J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 265: 13818-13824Google Scholar). When the ion at m/z 433.2 was fragmented in MS3 mode, the sequence of the tryptic fragment was confirmed, and the phosphorylated residue was identified as Ser485 (Fig. 3B). The equivalent residue in the α2-subunit (Ser491) was also found to be phosphorylated (P2 in Table II). Phosphorylation of Ser485 was also confirmed by Edman sequencing.Fig. 3Identification of Ser485 as an in vitro phosphorylation site in the α1-subunits by nano-ESI-MS/MS. A major 32P-labeled peak (peak 2 in Fig. 2) from the tryptic digest of AMPK α1-subunits phosphorylated by AMPKK was analyzed by nano-ESI-MS/MS and found to contain one phosphopeptide ion (P1 in Table II). A, the MS2 spectrum of the double-charged phosphopeptide ion (m/z 482.4) is shown. A loss of 98 Da was observed (H3PO4) under low collision-induced dissociation (CID) energy to produce an ion at m/z 433.2. B, the MS3 spectrum of the m/z 433.2 daughter ion is shown. The y5 and y6 fragments have a mass difference of 69 Da, corresponding to dehydroalanine, identifying the product of phosphoserine after losing H3PO4. ΔS denotes dehydroalanine, and b and y refer to ions c"

Specialized DNA polymerases transiently replace the replicative polymerase and copy past lesions, thus generating mutations, the major initiating cause of cancer. We monitored, in Escherichia coli, the kinetics of replication of both strands of DNA molecules containing a single replication block in either the leading or lagging strand. Despite a block in the leading strand, lagging-strand synthesis proceeded further, implying transient uncoupling of concurrent strand synthesis. Replication through the lesion requires specialized DNA polymerases and is achieved with similar kinetics and efficiencies in both strands."

Here we show that FK506 binding protein (Fkbp6) localizes to meiotic chromosome cores and regions of homologous chromosome synapsis. Targeted inactivation of Fkbp6 in mice results in aspermic males and the absence of normal pachytene spermatocytes. Moreover, we identified the deletion of Fkbp6 exon 8 as the causative mutation in spontaneously male sterile as / as mutant rats. Loss of Fkbp6 results in abnormal pairing and misalignments between homologous chromosomes, nonhomologous partner switches, and autosynapsis of X chromosome cores in meiotic spermatocytes. Fertility and meiosis are normal in Fkbp6 mutant females. Thus, Fkbp6 is a component of the synaptonemal complex essential for sex-specific fertility and for the fidelity of homologous chromosome pairing in meiosis."

Tracing these distinct light-input pathways into the brain should aid our understanding of the clock-compass mechanisms necessary for successful migration."

Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2523) Google Scholar). The STAT proteins reside dormant in the cytoplasm of cells until they are activated in response to ligand binding to specific cell surface receptors. The pathway that leads to the activation of STAT1 involves a series of tyrosine phosphorylation events mediated by Janus kinase proteins. Phosphorylation of STAT1 by Janus kinase proteins at tyrosine 701 mediates STAT1 homodimerization and its subsequent translocation into the nucleus. In the nucleus, STAT1 regulates the transcription of numerous genes that are instrumental in controlling development, cell growth, and cell differentiation (for review, see Refs. 4Battle T.E. Frank D.A. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar and 5Bromberg J. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, the Janus kinase-STAT1 pathway is critical for cellular responses to microbial and viral infection (6Haque S.J. Williams B.R. Semin. Oncol. 1998; 25: 14-22PubMed Google Scholar). The general features of STAT1 activation are fairly well characterized; however, the mechanisms leading to STAT1 inactivation are less well defined. Recently, a family of proteins termed “protein inhibitors of activated STATs” (PIAS) was identified through their direct interactions with the STAT proteins (7Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 8Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Functional characterization of the PIAS proteins revealed that they inhibit the transcription activation of STAT-regulated genes. There are currently five unique PIAS proteins (PIAS1, PIAS3, PIASy, PIASx-α, and PIASx-β), each with distinct activities toward the different STAT family members. PIAS1 and PIAS3, for example, specifically inhibit STAT1- and STAT3-mediated gene activation, respectively (7Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). The specific mechanism by which the PIAS proteins inhibit STAT activity in vivo is unclear, although in vitro studies suggest that they may regulate interactions between STATs and DNA (7Liu B.

After their identification as regulators of STAT function, the PIAS proteins were shown to function as regulators of SUMO (small-ubiquitin like modifier) modification (9Rui H. Xu J. Mehta S. Fang H.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The first step involves the ATP-dependant formation of a thioester bond between SUMO and the E1 heterodimer consisting of Aos1 and Uba2. The second step involves the transfer of SUMO to the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9. In the third and final step, SUMO is covalently linked to a lysine residue in the targeted substrate. Recognition of the substrate involves direct interactions between Ubc9 and the substrate (1Bernier-Villamor V. Sampson D.A. Matunis M.J. Lima C.D.

The link between PIAS proteins and STAT has led us to hypothesize that STAT1 is a SUMO substrate and that its ability to activate transcription may be regulated by SUMO modification. In this paper we demonstrate that STAT1 is modified by SUMO both in vitro and in vivo and that PIASx-α acts as an E3 ligase for STAT1 modification. We mapped the site for SUMO modification of STAT1 to lysine 703, a residue that is in close proximity to the regulatory tyrosine 701. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 701 in response to cytokine signaling is essential for STAT1 dimerization and nuclear translocation, suggesting that SUMO modification of lysine 703 may play an important regulatory role. In vivo transcription studies, however, indicate that SUMO modification at lysine 703 is not required for PIAS-mediated inhibition of STAT1 transcription activation. Our results demonstrate that the inhibition of STAT1 by PIAS proteins occurs through alternate mechanisms. Plasmid Constructions—Plasmids for expressing pCMV5-FLAG-murine PIAS1 and pCMV5-FLAG-PIASx-α were generous gifts from Dr. Ke Shuai (University of California, Los Angeles, CA). pCMV-STAT1-FLAG, pcDNA1/SUMO-3, pcDNA6/STAT1, pEGFP-C1/SUMO-1, pEGFP-C1/SUMO-2, pGEX-4T-1/STAT1, pGEX-4T-1/PIAS1,PGEX-4T-1/PIASx-α, and PGEX-4T-1/STAT1 were all produced using standard PCR and sub-cloning techniques. Site-directed mutagenesis of STAT1 constructs was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All mutants were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant SUMO-1, Aos1/Uba2, and Ubc9 were expressed and purified as previously described (1Bernier-Villamor V. Sampson D.A. Matunis M.J. Lima C.D. Cell. 2002; 108: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Recombinant PIAS1 and PIASx-α were produced in bacteria by transforming with the appropriate pGEX-4T-1 vector and inducing expression with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside at 20 °C for 6 h. Recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant PIAS1 and PIASx-α were subsequently cleaved from the beads by thrombin protease as outlined by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). STAT1 was transcribed and translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine as outlined by the manufacturer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). In Vitro SUMO Modification Assays—In vitro SUMO modification of STAT1 was performed using two individual assay conditions. Assays performed using high concentrations of Aos1/Uba2 and Ubc9 contained 0.5 μm Aos1/Uba2, 12 μm Ubc9, 10 μm mature SUMO, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 2 μl of in vitro translated STAT1. Assays performed using limiting concentrations of Aos1/Uba2 and Ubc9 contained 0.3 μm Aos1/Uba2, 0.3 μm Ubc9, 7.7 μm mature SUMO, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 2 μl of in vitro translated STAT1 or 200 ng of recombinant STAT1. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Reactions were quenched with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography or by immunoblot analysis with a STAT1α p91 (C-24) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Transcription Reporter Assays—U3A cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were plated onto 12-well tissue culture plates 12 h before transfection and transfected with the indicated plasmid DNAs (300 ng of STAT1, 300 ng of SUMO, 100–1200 ng of PIAS) using Lipofectin as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Total DNA concentrations in each transfection experiment were kept constant by adding empty vector DNA to 1.6 μg. 3 ng of a pRL-TK Renilla luciferase control plasmid was transfected into all cells to normalize for transfection efficiencies. In all cases, cell lysates were analyzed or processed 24 h post-transfection. When indicated, interferon-γ (PeProTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) (10 ng/ml) was added 6 h before luciferase assays were performed or 1 h before immunoblot analysis. For luciferase reporter assays, cells were lysed in 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer, and dual luciferase assays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Protein expression of all transfected plasmids was checked by immunoblot analysis using appropriate antibodies (anti-GFP antibody (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). Nickel Affinity Chromatography—Cells were lysed in 100 μl of buffer containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole at pH 8.0 24 h post-transfection. Cell lysates were mixed gently with 25 μl of nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for1hat room temperature. Beads were washed 3 times with buffer containing 8 m urea, 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole at pH 6.3. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads using 40 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immunoblot analysis was performed using the STAT1α p91 (C-24) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). STAT1 Is a Substrate for SUMO Modification—The recent findings that PIAS proteins function as SUMO E3 ligases for a variety of transcription factors led us to address the question of whether STAT1 may be a substrate for SUMO modification. A SUMO modification assay containing recombinant SUMO-1, Uba2/Aos1, and Ubc9 was used to determine whether STAT1 could serve as a substrate for SUMO modification in vitro. STAT1 was translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. As demonstrated by SDS-PAGE, the ∼91-kDa full-length STAT1 was produced as well as several smaller protein products possibly resulting from translation initiation at internal methionines or from proteolysis of the full-length protein (Fig. 1, lane 1). Translated STAT1 was added to an assay reaction containing 10 μm SUMO, 12 μm Ubc9, and 0.5 μm Uba2/Aos1, conditions under which most SUMO substrates can be modified in the absence of exogenously added E3 ligases. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE, a novel protein band could be detected migrating with a molecular mass of ∼106 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 3). Conjugation of a single molecule of SUMO to protein substrates resulted in an ∼15-kDa shift in molecular mass, suggesting that the 106-kDa protein corresponds to STAT1 conjugated to SUMO at a single lysine residue. The presence of the 106-kDa band was dependent on SUMO, because it was not detected in reactions containing only exogenously added E1 and E2 enzymes (Fig. 1, lane 2). Modification reactions containing glutathione S-transferase-SUMO produced an appropriately higher molecular mass band of ∼135 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 4), presenting further evidence that the shifted bands correspond to SUMO-modified STAT1. STAT1 was modified in the above assay in the presence of relatively high concentrations of E1 and E2 enzymes and in the absence of an exogenously added E3 enzyme. This is consistent with the findings for most SUMO substrates, where E3 ligases are required only when E1 and E2 enzyme concentrations are significantly lower. To assay for the ability of PIAS proteins to function as E3 ligases for STAT1, we therefore repeated the above assay using reduced concentrations of Aos1/Uba2 and Ubc9. Translated STAT1 was added to an assay containing 7.7 μm SUMO, 0.3 μm Ubc9, and 0.3 μm Uba2/Aos1. A faint protein band was detected by SDS-PAGE, indicating that STAT1 was not efficiently modified by SUMO under these reduced E1 and E2 enzyme conditions (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Assays using the same low concentrations of Uba2/Aos1 and Ubc9 were also performed in the presence of exogenously added PIAS1 or PIASx-α. Surprisingly, we observed weak activity for PIAS1 (Fig. 2A, lane 3) but found that PIASx-α could stimulate the SUMO modification of STAT1 in an E3-like manner (Fig. 2A, lane 4). As a control for PIAS1 activity, we also performed assays using the androgen receptor as a substrate. Both PIAS1 and PIASx-α were able to enhance the SUMO modification of the androgen receptor to the same extent as previously shown (18Nishida T. Yasuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41311-41317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 19Kotaja N. Vihinen M. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17781-17788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), indicating that both proteins are equally active (Fig. 2B). There are two shifted bands corresponding to SUMO-modified androgen receptor because androgen receptor is modified at two lysines (23Poukka H. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14145-14150Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Rabbit reticulocyte lysate contains many factors that could affect the efficiency of SUMO modification. We therefore expressed STAT1 in bacteria as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and assayed for its ability to be modified in reactions containing only purified, recombinant factors. Recombinant STAT1 was incubated with an assay mix containing 7.7 μm SUMO, 0.3 μm Ubc9, and 0.3 μm Uba2/Aos1. These conditions were neither sufficient to modify in vitro translated STAT1 efficiently (Fig. 2A, lane 2) nor were they sufficient to modify recombinant STAT1, as observed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3, lane 2). To determine whether PIASx-α could stimulate SUMO modification of recombinant STAT1, a similar SUMO modification reaction was supplemented with 0.3 μm PIASx-α. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the addition of PIASx-α stimulated SUMO modification of the recombinant STAT1, as revealed by the presence of a protein band of ∼132 kDa (∼15 kDa larger that unmodified glutathione S-transferase-STAT1) (Fig. 3, lane 3). These results further demonstrate that STAT1 is modified by SUMO in vitro and indicate that PIASx-α functions directly as an E3 ligase to promote STAT1 modification. STAT1 Is Modified at a Single Lysine Residue at Position 703—STAT1 has a modular structure with the amino terminus containing a coiled-coil domain, the central region containing the DNA binding domain, and the carboxyl terminus containing an SH2 domain followed by a transactivation domain (Fig. 4A). STAT1 contains two potential SUMO modification sites defined by the consensus sequence ψKXE, where ψ is a hydrophobic residue, K is the lysine residue modified by SUMO-1, X is any amino acid, and E is glutamic acid (17Sampson D.A. Wang M. Matunis M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21664-21669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 24Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). This consensus sequence defines the site modified in many (but not all) SUMO substrates. The consensus sequences in STAT1 reside around lysine 110 in the amino terminus and lysine 703, which is in the carboxyl-terminal region between the SH2 domain and the transactivation domain (Fig. 4A). The consensus sequence surrounding lysine 703 is of particular interest because of its close proximity to tyrosine 701, the tyrosine residue phosphorylated in response to cytokine stimulation. To determine whether either of these sites in STAT1 is modified by SUMO, we mutated lysine residues 110 and 703 to arginine. Mutant and wild-type STAT1 proteins were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine, and their ability to be modified by SUMO was determined using in vitro assays followed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4B). Both wild-type STAT1 and the lysine 110 to arginine mutant STAT1 could be modified by SUMO, as determined by the appearance of the ∼106-kDa STAT1-SUMO conjugate (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–2 and 4–5). In contrast the ∼106-kDa band corresponding to SUMO-modified STAT1 was not detected with the lysine 703 to arginine mutant STAT1 (Fig. 4B, lanes 7–8). These SUMO modification assays were performed in the presence of high concentrations of E1 and E2 enzymes and no added E3, although similar results were also obtained with low concentrations of E1 and E2 enzymes in the presence of PIASx-α (Fig. 4B, lanes 3, 6, and 9). These results indicate that lysine 703 is the major site for SUMO modification of STAT1 in vitro. The results also indicate that PIASx-α enhances specifically the modification at lysine 703. STAT1 Is Constitutively Modified by SUMO in Vivo—The above results indicate that STAT1 is modified by SUMO in vitro and that this modification, which occurs on a lysine residue only two amino acids away from tyrosine 701, may be functionally significant. Therefore, we next performed experiments to assess whether STAT1 is modified by SUMO in vivo and also whether its modification may be influenced by PIAS overexpression and/or by cytokine stimulation. U3A cells, which do not express endogenous STAT1, were transfected with plasmids encoding for either Myc-His-tagged wild-type STAT1 or Myc-His-tagged lysine 703 to arginine mutant STAT1. 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed in guanidine hydrochloride, and STAT1 protein was purified by nickel affinity chromatography. Immunoblot analysis of the affinity-purified proteins with an anti-STAT1 antibody revealed unmodified STAT1 but no detectable higher molecular mass bands corresponding to possible STAT1-SUMO conjugates (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 6). Overexpression of SUMO by transient transfection can enhance the modification of many SUMO substrates in vivo. Therefore, cells were co-transfected with an Myc-His STAT1 plasmid and plasmids encoding for GFP-tagged SUMO-2 (we have observed that STAT1 is equally modified by SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3 in our in vitro and in vivo experimental conditions; data not shown). GFP-tagged SUMO was used because it causes a unique shift in molecular mass of ∼45 kDa. Cells were again lysed 24 h after transfection, and STAT1 was purified by nickel affinity chromatography. Under these conditions, a faint protein band with the predicted molecular mass of a STAT1-GFP-SUMO conjugate was detected by immunoblot analysis, but only in cells transfected with wild-type STAT1 (Fig. 5, lane 4) and not in cells transfected with the lysine 703 to arginine STAT1 mutant (Fig. 5, lane 8). These results indicate that a small fraction of STAT1 is modified by SUMO at lysine 703 in vivo. Our in vitro findings indicated that PIASx-α could act as an E3 ligase and stimulate the SUMO modification of STAT1. We therefore examined whether overexpression of PIASx-α could enhance SUMO modification of STAT1 in vivo. U3A cells were co-transfected with an Myc-His STAT1 plasmid, GFP-SUMO plasmid, and a plasmid encoding for FLAG-PIASx-α. Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection, and STAT1 was purified by nickel affinity chromatography. Immunoblot analysis revealed a significant enhancement of the SUMO modification of wild-type STAT1 in the presence of overexpressed PIASx-α (Fig. 5, lane 4 versus 5). No SUMO-modified STAT1 could be detected in cells transfected with the lysine 703 to arginine STAT1 mutant (Fig. 5, lane 9) or in cells overexpressing only STAT1 and PIASx-α but not SUMO (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 7). These results indicate that PIASx-α stimulates the SUMO modification of STAT1 in vivo and further demonstrate that STAT1 is modified on lysine 703. The expression of transfected plasmids was confirmed by immunoblot or immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 5B; data not shown). Previous studies indicate that PIAS proteins may act specifically on activated STAT dimers (25Liao J. Fu Y. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5267-5272Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), suggesting that STAT1 SUMO modification may be up-regulated in response to STAT1 activation. To determine whether STAT1 activation and dimerization had any influence on SUMO modification, we treated cells with γ-interferon (IFN-γ) for 30 min after transfection with plasmids encoding for STAT1 or STAT1 and Myc-tagged SUMO-3 (again we have observed that STAT1 is equally modified by SUMO-1, SUMO-2, or SUMO-3 in vitro and in vivo). Myc-tagged SUMO was used in this experiment to provide further evidence that STAT1 is indeed modified by SUMO in vivo. The Myc-tagged SUMO is expected to cause an ∼15-kDa shift in STAT1 molecular mass rather than an ∼45-kDa shift observed with GFP-SUMO. After 30 min of IFN-γ stimulation, cells were lysed, and STAT1 was purified and analyzed by immunoblot analysis as described above. STAT1-SUMO conjugates were not detectable in cells transfected with only STAT1 either in the absence or in the presence of IFN-γ (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and 4). In cells co-transfected with both STAT1 and SUMO, STAT1-SUMO conjugates of the predicted molecular mass were detected in both treated and untreated cells at equivalent levels (Fig. 6, lanes 5 and 6). These results indicate that STAT1 is constitutively modified by SUMO in unstimulated cells and that IFN-γ does not have any appreciable affect on the overall levels of STAT1 SUMO modification. We were unable to demonstrate directly using SUMO antibodies that the higher molecular mass forms of STAT1 are in fact SUMO conjugates. However, collectively, the data provide compelling evidence that STAT1 is modified by SUMO at lysine 703 in vivo. First, detection of the higher molecular mass forms of STAT1 was enhanced in cells overexpressing SUMO. Second, detection of the higher molecular mass forms of STAT1 was further enhanced by co-expression of PIASx-α, which we found promotes SUMO modification of STAT1 in vitro. Third, the higher molecular mass forms of STAT1 that were detected corresponded to the predicted molecular masses of STAT1-SUMO or STAT1-GFP-SUMO, depending on the form of SUMO overexpressed in the cells. Finally, the higher molecular mass forms of STAT1 were not detected in cells expressing the lysine 703 to arginine mutant STAT1, which we showed is not modified by SUMO in vitro. SUMO Modification of STAT1 at Lysine 703 Is Not Required for PIASx-α or PIAS1-mediated Inhibition of STAT1—Previous studies using in vivo reporter assays indicate that PIAS proteins can inhibit STAT-mediated gene activation (7Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 25Liao J. Fu Y. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5267-5272Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26Liu B. Gross M. ten Hoeve J. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3203-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that STAT1 can be modified by SUMO at lysine 703 in vivo and that PIASx-α can act as an E3 ligase to stimulate modification of STAT1 at this residue. To determine whether SUMO modification of STAT1 at lysine 703 is functionally related to PIAS-mediated STAT1 inactivation, luciferase assays were preformed using a reporter construct containing a (3x)Ly-6E promoter fused to the firefly luciferase gene. (3x)Ly-6E is a construct consisting of three copies of a promoter element found in the murine Ly-6A/E gene, which is transcriptionally induced by treatment of cells with IFN-α, β, or γ (27Khan K.D. Shuai K. Lindwall G. Maher S.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Bothwell A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6806-6810Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We first performed experiments to determine whether the lysine 703 to arginine mutant STAT1 could activate gene expression in a manner comparable with wild-type STAT1. U3A cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged wild-type STAT1 or a lysine 703 to arginine mutant STAT1 and the (3x)Ly-6E reporter construct. The transfected cells were treated with IFN-γ for 6 h, and cell lysates were then assayed for luciferase activity. Cells co-transfected with wild-type STAT1 and (3x)Ly-6E yielded a ∼4.6-fold increase in luciferase expression in response to IFN-γ compared with a ∼5-fold increase when the lysine 703 to arginine mutant STAT1 was co-transfected with the reporter construct (Fig. 7A). These results indicate that a lysine to arginine substitution at residue 703 in STAT1 does not inhibit STAT1 ability to activate transcription in response to IFN-γ stimulation. The slight, but reproducible increase in transcription activation observed with the lysine 703 to arginine mutant STAT1 relative to the wild-type STAT1 suggests that SUMO modification of lysine 703 may play an inhibitory role. We next assayed for the ability of PIAS1 and PIASx-α to inhibit gene activation induced by wild-type STAT1. It has previously been shown that PIAS1 is able to inhibit STAT1-mediated gene activation (7Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 25Liao J. Fu Y. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5267-5272Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26Liu B. Gross M. ten Hoeve J. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3203-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar); however, the affects of PIASx-α on STAT1 gene activation have not been definitively characterized. When FLAG-tagged PIAS1 was co-transfected in increasing amounts with wild-type STAT1, PIAS1 reduced IFN-γ-stimulated transcriptional activation in a dose-responsive manner (Fig. 7B), similar to that previously observed by others (7Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 25Liao J. Fu Y. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A. 2001; 98: 3203-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). When FLAG-tagged PIASx-α was co-transfected with wild-type STAT1, a reduction in gene activation was also observed (Fig. 7B). Both PIAS1 and PIASx-α were expressed at comparable levels in these experiments, as determined by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). At these expression levels PIASx-α acted as a more potent inhibitor of STAT1 gene activation, reducing induced expression of the reporter gene by 2.1-fold at the lower protein concentration compared with 1.1-fold inhibition by PIAS1. Finally, we examined the ability of PIAS1 and PIASx-α to inhibit gene activation mediated by the lysine 703 to arginine mutant STAT1 that cannot be modified by SUMO. Cells were co-transfected with the lysine 703 to arginine STAT1 mutant, the (3x)Ly-6E reporter construct, and PIAS1 or PIASx-α. Cell lysates were again prepared 6 h after IFN-γ treatment for luciferase assays. These assays revealed that the lysine 703 to arginine mutant STAT1 is inhibited by both PIAS1 and PIASx-α (Fig. 7C). Most significantly, the levels of inhibition were comparable with the levels of inhibition observed with wild-type STAT1. These results demonstrate that the PIAS proteins are able to inhibit interferon-induced gene activation by STAT1 in a manner that is independent of STAT1 SUMO modification. Because the discovery that PIAS proteins act as E3 ligases for SUMO modification, there has been speculation that STAT1 may be a SUMO substrate. We have demonstrated that STAT1 can be modified by SUMO at lysine residue 703 in vitro and also provide compelling evidence that STAT1 is modified at this same lysine residue in vivo. We have also found that PIASx-α (but not PIAS1) can function as an E3 ligase to enhance the SUMO modification of STAT1. Overexpression of PIASx-α, like PIAS1, was able to inhibit STAT1-mediated gene activation in cultured cells. Significantly, however, both PIAS1- and PIASx-α-mediated inhibition of STAT1 gene activation was found to be independent of SUMO modification of STAT1 itself. The specific mechanism by which PIAS proteins inhibit STAT1-activated transcription in vivo has not previously been defined. In vitro experiments suggest that direct interactions between PIAS1 and STAT1 may interfere with the STAT1 ability to bind DNA (7Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The recent discoveries that PIAS proteins function as SUMO E3 ligases, however, has raised the possibility that PIAS-mediated inhibition of STAT1 transcription may involve direct SUMO modification of STAT1. Although our findings indicate that STAT1 can be modified by SUMO, several lines of evidence indicate that this modification does not play a direct role in the PIAS-mediated inhibition of transcription measured in our assays. First, our results indicate that both PIASx-α and PIAS1 are able to inhibit STAT1-mediated gene activation in vivo but that only PIASx-α acts as a SUMO E3 ligase that enhances the SUMO modification of STAT1. Most significantly, PIAS1 and PIASx-α were able to inhibit both wild-type STAT1 and a mutant STAT1 not able to be modified by SUMO. Together these findings indicate that the PIAS proteins can inhibit STAT1 through a mechanism that is not dependent on direct SUMO modification of STAT1. Inhibition may involve interactions between STAT1 and the PIAS proteins that prevent DNA binding and/or interaction with other regulatory factors, as previously suggested (7Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is also possible that the observed inhibition of STAT1 may involve PIAS-mediated SUMO modification of transcription regulators other than STAT1. Notably, overexpression of both PIAS1 and PIASx-α in vivo enhances the SUMO modification of many proteins (data not shown) (10Kotaja N. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5222-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Although the precise identity of these SUMO conjugates is not known, they are likely to include numerous transcriptional regulators known to undergo SUMO modification. It is conceivable that the enhanced modification of some of these factors could indirectly regulate STAT1 activity. Consistent with this model, LEF1 (20Sachdev S. Bruhn L. Sieber H. Pichler A. Melchior F. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3088-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), p53 (13Schmidt D. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2872-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), C/EBPα (22Subramanian L. Benson M.D. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9134-9141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and the progesterone receptor (15Chauchereau A. Amazit L. Quesne M. Guiochon-Mantel A. Milgrom E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12335-12343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) are all inhibited by PIAS protein overexpression, independent of their ability to be directly modified by SUMO. Although our findings do not reveal a relationship between SUMO modification of STAT1 and PIAS-mediated inhibition of its transcriptional activity, our findings do nonetheless establish that STAT1 is a SUMO substrate. To address the effects of SUMO modification on STAT1, more specific approaches to selectively enhance the levels of STAT1 SUMO modification in vivo are required. However, the position of modification at lysine 703 provides insights that allow us to speculate on the role for SUMO modification of STAT1. Analysis of the crystal structure of STAT1 reveals that residues encompassing the SUMO modification site are located at the dimer interface (28Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Significantly, however, amino acid residues likely to be directly involved in interactions with Ubc9 and subsequent SUMO modification (isoleucine 702, lysine 703, and glutamic acid 705) are exposed on the surface of the protein dimer (Fig. 8; Ref. 28Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The positions of these residues suggest that the phosphorylated STAT1 dimer could be a substrate for SUMO modification, a suggestion that is supported by preliminary in vitro studies (data not shown). The enzymes involved in SUMO conjugation (including the PIAS proteins) are concentrated in the nucleus, making it reasonable to hypothesize that SUMO modification of STAT1 is a nuclear event. SUMO modification of STAT1 dimers in the nucleus could have a stabilizing effect by protecting the dimer from phosphatases, or it could play a role in recruiting co-factors that regulate STAT1-mediated transcription activation. Alternatively, SUMO modification at lysine 703 could destabilize STAT1 dimers by directly interfering with dimerization or by attracting the TC45 phosphatase involved in STAT1 dephosphorylation (29ten Hoeve J. de Jesus Ibarra-Sanchez M. Fu Y. Zhu W. Tremblay M. David M. Shuai K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5662-5668Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that the lysine 703 to arginine mutant STAT1 showed modest but consistently stronger IFN-γ induced gene activation relative to wild-type STAT1. This observation suggests that SUMO modification of STAT1 may repress its ability to activate gene expression. Several additional transcription factors that are modified by SUMO behave in a similar manner (22Subramanian L. Benson M.D. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9134-9141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 23Poukka H. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mincheneau N. Le Goff P. Michel D. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have shown that STAT1 is a SUMO substrate and that PIASx-α is able to act as an E3 ligase and enhance its SUMO modification. Most importantly, we have demonstrated that inhibition of STAT1 by overexpression of PIAS proteins does not require direct SUMO modification of STAT1 itself. We propose a model in which PIAS overexpression leads to the SUMO modification of other transcription regulators that indirectly affect STAT1-mediated gene activation. Identification of these other regulatory SUMO substrates will be an important task for the future. In addition, it will also be of great interest to determine how SUMO modification of STAT1 at lysine residue 703 regulates its functions. We thank all members of the laboratory for helpful comments and suggestions during the course of this work. We are especially grateful to Dr. Ke Shuai for the generous gift of PIAS expression vectors, Dr. George Stark for the generous gift of the U3A cells, and Terry Brown and members of his laboratory for assistance and advice with STAT1 transcription assays."

Active calpain alters the balance between tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities in filopodia, resulting in a net decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation, which mediates both filopodial stabilization and reduced lamellipodial protrusion.

The pH optimum of the reverse reaction was ∼5.5, as compared with ∼4.5 for the hydrolysis reaction. Non-ionic detergents and zinc cations inhibited the activity, whereas most other cations were stimulatory. Of note, sphingomyelin also was very inhibitory toward this reaction, whereas the anionic lipids, phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylserine, were stimulatory. Of various sphingosine stereoisomers tested in the reverse reaction, only the natural, d-erythro form could efficiently serve as a substrate. Using d-erythro-sphingosine and lauric acid as substrates, the reaction followed normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The K m and V max values toward sphingosine were 23.75 μm and 208.3 pmol/μg/h, respectively, whereas for lauric acid they were 73.76 μm and 232.5 pmol/μg/h, respectively. Importantly, the reverse activity was reduced in cell lysates from a Farber disease patient to the same extent as the acid ceramidase activity. Furthermore, when 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)) (NBD)-conjugated lauric acid and sphingosine were added to cultured lymphoblasts from a Farber disease patient in the presence of fumonisin B (1Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), the conversion to NBD-ceramide was reduced ∼30% when compared with normal cells. These data provide important new information on human acid ceramidase and further document its central role in sphingolipid metabolism. An overexpression system was recently developed to produce and purify recombinant, human acid ceramidase. In addition to ceramide hydrolysis, the purified enzyme was able to catalyze ceramide synthesis using [14C]lauric acid and sphingosine as substrates.

Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), the conversion to NBD-ceramide was reduced ∼30% when compared with normal cells. These data provide important new information on human acid ceramidase and further document its central role in sphingolipid metabolism. Ceramide is an important cellular lipid involved in signal transduction and the biosynthesis of complex sphingolipids (1Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Sph and sphingosine 1-phosphate, a phosphorylated derivative of Sph, exert a variety of effects on cell growth and differentiation (3Spiegel S. Cuvillier O. Edsall L. Kohama T. Menzeleev R.

Because ceramide degradation is the only catabolic source of Sph, ceramidase activity is considered a rate-limiting step in determining the intracellular levels of this compound (5Merrill Jr., A.H.

Acid ceramidase (N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase (EC 3.5.1.23), AC) is one of several enzymes responsible for ceramide degradation within mammalian cells (8Gatt S. J. Biol.

Based on its in vitro pH optimum of ∼4.5, the hydrolytic activity of this enzyme is thought to occur within lysosomes and/or late endosomes. An inherited deficiency of AC activity results in the lipid storage disorder, Farber disease, characterized by progressive joint pain, lipid accumulation in various tissues, and early death (9Moser H.W.

It was found to be a heterodimeric enzyme containing two subunits, α (∼13 kDa) and β (∼40 kDa), both of which resulted from cleavage of a ∼55-kDa precursor polypeptide.

In addition, insertional mutagenesis of the mouse AC gene led to an early embryonic lethal phenotype, indicating that AC activity is essential for mammalian development (15Li C.M. Park J.H.

In the 1960s, Gatt first reported that partially purified AC preparations carried out ceramide synthesis using free fatty acids and Sph as substrates (i.e. the ceramidase-associated “reverse reaction”) (8Gatt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3131-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gatt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3724-3730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, because these early studies did not use highly purified enzyme, the question of whether a single protein could catalyze the hydrolysis and reverse reactions remained unclear. Recent studies using several cloned neutral and alkaline ceramidases have confirmed these early observations and revealed that these enzymes, which are distinct from AC, also can catalyze both reactions in vitro (i.e. ceramide hydrolysis and synthesis) (17Okino N.

However, based on the acidic pH optimum of AC and the fact that de novo ceramide synthesis is not thought to occur within lysosomes, it has remained unclear whether AC could catalyze the reverse reaction. Recently, we established a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line overexpressing the full-length, human AC cDNA, and purified the recombinant enzyme to apparent homogeneity from the culture medium. 2He, X., Okino, N., Dhami, R., Dagan, A., Gatt, S., Schulze, H., Sandhoff, K., and Schuchman, E. H. (2003) J. Biol. Chem., in press.2He, X., Okino, N., Dhami, R., Dagan, A., Gatt, S., Schulze, H., Sandhoff, K., and Schuchman, E. H. (2003) J. Biol. Chem., in press. In the course of these studies we determined that purified AC could indeed catalyze ceramide synthesis in vitro using lauric acid and Sph as substrates. To better understand the reverse activity of human AC and to determine whether this activity occurred in situ, as well as in vitro, we have now investigated the biochemical and mechanistic characteristics of the AC-associated reverse reaction using purified, recombinant AC and cultured cells obtained from Farber disease patients. Materials—[1-14C]Lauric acid (55 mCi/mmol), [3-3H]d-erythro-sphingosine (20 Ci/mmol), and [lauroyl-1-14C]d-erythro-sphingosine (i.e. 14C-labeled C12 ceramide, 55 mCi/mmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). BODIPY- and NBD-conjugated C12 fatty acid were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). BODIPY-conjugated C12 ceramide was synthesized as previously described (23Dagan A. Agmon V. Gatt S. Dinur T. Merril A.H. Hannun Y.A. Sphingolipid Metabolism and Cell Signaling, Part B. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, San Diego1999: 293-304Google Scholar). Other lipid standards were from Matreya, Inc. (State College, PA). TLC plates (TLC LK6 D Silica Gel 60) were purchased from Whatman (Clifton, NJ). Tissue culture media and reagents were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Tissue culture plastic ware and all organic solvents were purchased from Fisher Scientific Co. (Springfield, NJ), except for an 8-well Lab-Tek II glass chamber slide that was from Nalge Nunc International (Naperville, IL). A protein determination kit was purchased from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Hyperfilm MP and EN3HANCE spray were from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ) and PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc. (Boston, MA), respectively. Monoclonal anti-LAMP-2, anti-EEA1, and anti-Bip antibodies were from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Anti-AC polyclonal antibodies were prepared commercially in rabbits using purified, recombinant human AC as the antigen. Alexa-568 and Alexa-488 secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other biochemical reagents were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). AC Purification—The purification of recombinant, human AC was carried out as previously described.2 Briefly, the enzyme was purified from the culture media of overexpressing CHO cells by sequential chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose, Blue Sepharose, and Superose 12. The final preparation revealed only AC-specific polypeptides (i.e. AC α- and β-subunits). Total protein was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Culture—CHO cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium supplemented with l-glutamine (4 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (10%) in a humid incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Human Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoid cell lines were derived from a normal individual or from a patient with Farber disease and routinely grown in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium containing l-glutamine (4 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (10%). AC Assay—AC activity was measured using either BODIPY-conjugated C12 ceramide or 14C-labeled C12 ceramide as substrates, as previously described (24He X. Li C.M. Park J.H. Dagan A. Gatt S. Schuchman E.H. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Reverse AC Assay—Unless otherwise noted, reverse AC activity was determined using the purified, CHO-derived AC as the enzyme source. A stock solution was prepared containing [14C]lauric acid (1 nmol/reaction), Sph (0.5 nmol/reaction), and Triton X-100 (0.1%, v/v), vortexed vigorously, and dried under a stream of 80% nitrogen. The dried mixture was then resuspended by sonication in 0.2 m citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 300 mm NaCl. The standard 10-μl reaction mixture contained 5 μl of pure AC, [14C]lauric acid (1 nmol, 100 μm final concentration), Sph (0.5 nmol, 50 μm final concentration), 0.05% Triton X-100, and 150 mm NaCl in 0.1 m citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. To determine the effect of cations on the reverse activity, MES (pH 6.0) was used instead of citrate-phosphate buffer. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C in a water bath for 1 h and then spotted onto a TLC plate and dried (using a hair dryer). [14C]Lauric acid and synthesized [14C]ceramide were separated by TLC using solvent system I consisting of chloroform/methanol/25% ammonium hydroxide (90:20:0.5, v/v). The TLC plate was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen that was subsequently scanned using a Strom 860 PhosphorImager system (Amersham Biosciences). The undigested, radioactive substrate (lauric acid) and product (ceramide) were identified by co-migration with standards, and the signal was quantified using the ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). To evaluate the specificity of individual fatty acids on the AC-associated reverse reaction, [3H]Sph was used as a substrate. Briefly, [3H]Sph and fatty acids of different chain lengths were mixed well with Triton X-100 as described above and dried. The dried mixture was then resuspended by sonication in 0.2 m citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 300 mm NaCl. The final reaction mixtures contained 50 μm [3H]Sph (diluted with cold Sph), 100 μm of each fatty acid, 0.05% Triton-X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1 m citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C in a water bath for 1 h, spotted onto a TLC plate, and dried using a hair dryer. [3H]Sph and synthesized [3H]ceramide were separated by TLC using the solvent system described above. The plates were then sprayed with EN3HANCE and radiographed on Hyperfilm MP. For quantification of the lipids, the films were scanned and analyzed with Image software (National Institutes of Health). Determination of AC-associated Reverse Activity in Lymphoid Cells— For in vitro studies, lymphoid cells were harvested, washed 3× with PBS, and centrifuged (1600 × g). Cell pellets were suspended and disrupted in 0.25 m sucrose by three cycles of freeze-thawing and sonication. The AC-associated reverse activity, as well as the ceramidase activity, were determined in the cell lysates using [14C]lauric acid and Sph, or BODIPY-conjugated C12 ceramide as substrates, respectively. For in situ experiments, lymphoid cells (5 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum) were incubated with 20 μm NBD-C12-fatty acid and 10 μm Sph for 2 h. After incubation, the cells were harvested and washed once with PBS. Total lipids were extracted using chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v) for 15 min with sonication and then centrifuged at 13,600 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were removed and dried using a Speed-Vac concentrator, applied to TLC plates, and developed using solvent system I. Signals were visualized and quantified using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager. Fluorescence Microscopy—Normal human skin fibroblasts, grown on glass chamber slides at 37 °C, were fixed with methanol for 5 min at –20 °C and then dried for 10 min. After being washed twice with PBS, the fixed cells were incubated with PBS containing 10% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum, 0.05% Triton X-100, and the anti-AC antibody (1:200 dilution of primary, rabbit serum) in combination with one of the following commercial antibodies: 1) anti-LAMP-2 (1.25 μg/ml), 2) anti-EEA1 (1.25 μg/ml), or 3) anti-BiP (1.25 μg/ml). The slides were then washed 3× with PBS for 5 min, incubated for 1 h with secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 and 568 (1:500), and washed again 3× with PBS for 5 min. They were then observed with a fluorescent microscope (Eclipse E800, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Effects of pH and Detergents—Previous studies had indicated that purified, recombinant human AC could carry out ceramide synthesis in vitro using [14C]lauric acid and Sph as substrates and that the pH optimum for this reaction was ∼5.5, as compared with 4.5 for the hydrolysis reaction.2 The effects of various detergents on the reverse reaction were next examined. As shown in Fig. 1, the reaction proceeded most efficiently in the absence of detergents. Triton X-100 and Igepal CA-630, both non-ionic detergents, inhibited the enzyme activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Taurocholate, an anionic detergent, strongly inhibited the enzyme activity at low concentrations, but the activity was partially restored at concentrations around 0.2%. Based on these findings, in the final assay mixture only a small amount of Triton X-100 (0.05%) was included to solubilize the substrates. Effect of Cations—The addition of CaCl2, MgCl2, and NaCl to the reaction mixtures increased AC reverse activity moderately (Fig. 2A). In contrast, ZnCl2 was very inhibitory toward this reaction. The addition of EDTA (10 mm) did not affect the reverse activity. 3N. Okino, X. He, S. Gatt, K. Sandhoff, M. Ito, and E. H. Schuchman, unpublished observation. To further investigate the salt dependence of this reaction, the activity was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of NaCl. As shown in Fig. 2B, NaCl activation was concentration-dependent, with ∼2-fold activation seen at ∼150 mm. Therefore, in the final assay mixture the NaCl concentration was maintained at 150 mm, close to the physiologic salt concentration. Kinetics of the Reverse Activity—To study the kinetics of the reverse reaction, the activity was measured using various amounts of each substrate (Fig. 3). For these studies, the concentration of either lauric acid (Fig. 3A) or Sph (Fig. 3B) was fixed at 200 μm in the reaction mixture and that of the other was increased. As can be seen, the Lineweaver-Burk plots of these data were linear and followed normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The apparent K m and V max values of the reverse reaction for Sph were 23.75 μm and 208.3 pmol/μg/h and for lauric acid were 73.76 μm and 232.5 pmol/μg/h. Substrate Specificity of the Reverse Activity— Fig. 4A shows the substrate specificity of the reverse reaction toward various Sph stereoisomers. Among the stereoisomers tested, only the natural, d-erythro form was efficiently utilized as a substrate. d-erythro-dihydroSph and d -erythro-phytoSph were utilized to a limited extent, whereas d-threo, l-threo, and l-erythro were not utilized at all. We next evaluated which fatty acids could serve as substrates in this reaction. As seen in Fig. 4B, under the conditions studied fatty acids with chain lengths of 12 or 14 carbons were most efficiently used. Effects of Lipids—The effects of various phospholipids and sphingolipids on the reverse activity were next investigated and compared with their effects on the hydrolysis reaction (Fig. 5). Fig. 5A shows that the acidic phospholipids, phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidic acid (PA), significantly stimulated the reverse activity. In contrast, cardiolipin (CL), phosphatidylcholine (PC), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol inhibited this activity. As shown in Fig. 5B, sphingomyelin (SPM) also strongly inhibited the reverse activity, whereas glucosylceramide and C16-ceramide were less effective inhibitors. Notably, of the lipids tested, several were found to have differential effects on the reverse and hydrolysis reactions. For example, PA stimulated the reverse activity, but was inhibitory toward the hydrolysis reaction. SPM and CL, on the other hand, were very inhibitory toward the reverse reaction but stimulated the hydrolysis reaction. Reverse AC Activity in Farber Disease Cells—To further demonstrate that AC carried out the reverse reaction, we next used normal, human lymphoid cells and lymphoid cells from a patient with Farber disease containing mutations in the AC gene. As shown in Fig. 6A, the reverse activity was reduced in lysates prepared from the Farber disease cells to the same extent as ceramide hydrolysis, further demonstrating that both reactions were catalyzed by the same enzyme. To investigate whether AC carried out the reverse activity in situ, as well as in vitro, the lymphoid cell lines were incubated with NBD-C12-fatty acid and Sph with and without fumonisin B1. The amount of synthesized NBD-ceramide formed in the cells was then assessed. As shown in Fig. 6B, in the absence of fumonisin B1, the FD cells synthesized about 20% less NBD-ceramide than normal cells. When fumonisin B1 was included to inhibit ceramide synthesis by acyl CoA-dependent N-acyltransferase (ceramide synthetase), the reduction in the Farber disease cells as compared with normal was ∼30%. Note that there was no difference in the amount of ceramide synthesized by normal cells with or without fumonisin B1, indicating that little, if any, NBD-C12-fatty acid received CoA modification and was utilized by ceramide synthetase. Localization of AC in Cultured Skin Fibroblasts—We next determined the subcellular location of AC in normal, human skin fibroblasts using anti-human AC antibodies in combination with antibodies specific for several subcellular compartments (Fig. 7). As can be seen, most of the AC staining (red) was punctate and perinuclear, indicating that the majority of the enzyme was present in lysosomes or late endosomes. Co-incubation of the anti-AC antibodies with anti-LAMP-2 antibodies confirmed this observation (see yellow, merged image). Under these normal growth conditions, little or no AC colocalized with early endosomes (EEA1) or the endoplasmic reticulum (BiP). In the present study we describe characterization of the AC-associated reverse ceramidase activity. Several criteria demonstrate that AC can catalyze ceramide synthesis, as well as degradation. First, highly purified, recombinant AC could synthesize ceramide in vitro using free fatty acids and Sph as substrates. Second, cell lysates prepared from patients with Farber disease containing mutations in the AC gene were deficient in the AC-associated reverse activity to the same extent as they were deficient in the hydrolysis reaction. Third, in situ studies using NBD-labeled fatty acid and Sph revealed that the Farber disease cells synthesized ceramide less efficiently than normal cells, confirming the in vitro results. We also demonstrated that this reaction was distinct from the major, de novo ceramide synthesis reaction, because it proceeded in vitro without acyl-CoA, ATP, or Mg2+ and was not inhibited by fumonisin B1.3 The genes encoding several ceramidases have been recently cloned from eukaryotic and prokaryotic sources (20Mao C.

Among these, all but one (human alkaline ceramidase) can carry out the reverse ceramidase reaction in vitro. The characteristics of these reverse activities have not been fully evaluated, but from the data available some common features are evident: 1) Ceramidase-associated reverse activities proceed in an energy-independent manner and are resistant to fumonisin B1, revealing that the mechanism of the reverse reaction is distinct from that of acyl CoA-dependent N-acyltransferase (ceramide synthetase). 2) The optimum pH of the hydrolysis and reverse reactions are different for each enzyme. In the case of AC, the reverse reaction proceeded at a more alkaline pH than the hydrolysis reaction; for the other ceramidases the reverse reactions preferred a more acidic pH than the hydrolysis reactions. 3) The stereospecificity for the sphingoid base is very strict and the natural, d -erythro form is preferred. 4) In contrast to the sphingoid base, the utilization of fatty acids is quite broad.Table IProperties of cloned ceramidasesMolecular mass, SDS-PAGENumber of amino acidsReverse reactionHydrolysis pHReverse pHSph specificityFatty acid specificityRef.kDaHuman acid (AC)∼55 13(α) + 40(β)395+4.0-5.05.0-6.0d-erythro-Sph>PHS > DHSC12 > C14(10Bernardo K.

Open table in a new tab Detailed characterization of the AC-associated reverse reaction revealed some characteristics that were in common with the AC hydrolysis reaction but also some that were distinct. For example, the activation effect by NaCl and the preference for Sph (d18:1), as compared with sphinganine (d18:0), were shared by the hydrolysis and reverse reactions. In addition, both activities were inhibited by the addition of ceramide to the reaction mixture. Among the important differences were the pH optima for the reverse and hydrolysis reactions (∼5.5 and 4.5, respectively), suggesting that the two reactions likely occur in different subcellular compartments. Immunostaining using anti-AC antibodies and several subcellular markers revealed that under normal growth conditions most AC was present in lysosomes or late endosomes. In the future it will be interesting to subject cells to various stress stimuli and monitor the effects on AC localization, because, as has been shown previously for the related lipid hydrolase, acid sphingomyelinase, stress stimulation can lead to dramatic and rapid relocalization of enzymes from lysosomes/late endosomes to other cellular compartments (30Grassmé H.

The effect of various lipids on the AC-associated reverse and hydrolysis reactions also was very revealing. CL, PC, LPC, phosphatidylethanolamine, and SPM moderately activated the hydrolysis activity but inhibited the reverse activity at the same concentrations. Indeed, among the various lipids tested, SPM was the most effective inhibitor of the AC-associated reverse activity. CL and SPM also inhibited the reverse reaction associated with rat brain ceramidase (22El Bawab S. Birbes H. Roddy P. Szulc Z.M. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16758-16766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and similar to what we have found with AC, CL activated the hydrolysis reaction of that enzyme as well. CL is known to be a major lipid in mitochondria, and it has been suggested that CL might play a role in the regulation of one or more mitochondria-associated ceramidases. In contrast to CL and SPM, the anionic glycerophospholipid, PA, stimulated the reverse activity ∼30%, but inhibited the hydrolysis reaction. Another anionic glycerophospholipid, PS, which is known to activate some neutral sphingomyelinases (31Sawai H. Hannun Y.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 102: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 32Hofmann K. Tomiuk S. Wolff G. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5895-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), also activated the AC-associated reverse reaction to about the same extent as PA. The differential effects of pH and various lipids on the reverse versus hydrolysis reactions may explain, in part, how these activities are regulated in cells. In lysosomes and late endosomes, where the pH is between ∼4.0 and 4.5 and a high concentration of SPM likely exists due to the normal process of membrane turnover, the hydrolysis reaction should dominate. On the other hand, we found that PA and PS activated the AC-associated reverse activity. PS is abundant in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, and PA is formed by the action of either phospholipase D or diacylglycerol kinase during signal transduction. Therefore, it is possible to speculate that PS- and PA-rich compartments are optimal sites for ceramide formation via the AC-associated reverse reaction. Although our data show that under normal growth conditions AC is localized primarily in lysosomes and late endosomes, where it should function in ceramide breakdown, upon appropriate stimulation cells might relocate this enzyme to sites where the reverse reaction is favored. It is also notable that PA, which stimulates the AC-associated reverse reaction, markedly inhibited the hydrolysis reaction. In conclusion, we have shown that, similar to other cloned ceramidases, highly purified, recombinant AC can carry out ceramide synthesis using free fatty acids and sphingosine as substrates. This reaction is distinct from the activity of ceramide synthetase (acyl CoA-dependent N-acyltransferase) based on a number of criteria. We have also demonstrated that the AC-associated reverse reaction can proceed in situ and shown that cells from Farber disease patients are deficient in this activity, as well as ceramide hydrolysis. We also suggest that the differential effects of pH and various lipids on the AC-associated reverse and hydrolysis reactions indicate possible mechanisms by which the two activities might be regulated in cells. We believe that the AC-associated reverse reaction represents a “salvage” pathway for ceramide synthesis that is utilized only following cell stress and/or stimulation of signal transduction pathways requiring ceramide. We further believe that the normal subcellular location of AC in lysosomes/late endosomes might be altered under these conditions, similar to acid sphingomyelinase, moving the enzyme into a compartment that promotes ceramide production versus degradation."

In contrast, room-temperature measurements show normal metallic polarizabilities. Characteristic energies kBTG(N) [Boltzmann constant kB times a transition temperature TG(N)] are identified, below which the ferroelectric-like state develops. Generally, TG decreases [110 > TG(N) > 10K] as N increases, with pronounced even-odd alternations for N > 38. This new state of metallic matter may be related to bulk superconductivity."

https://openalex.org/W2104342221,"The regulation of cell growth and differentiation by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is mediated by the Smad proteins. In the nucleus, the Smad proteins are negatively regulated by two closely related nuclear proto-oncoproteins, Ski and SnoN. When overexpressed, Ski and SnoN induce oncogenic transformation of chicken embryo fibroblasts. However, the mechanism of transformation by Ski and SnoN has not been defined. We have previously reported that Ski and SnoN interact directly with Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 and repress their ability to activate TGF-β target genes through multiple mechanisms. Because Smad proteins are tumor suppressors, we hypothesized that the ability of Ski and SnoN to inactivate Smad function may be responsible for their transforming activity. Here, we show that the receptor regulated Smad proteins (Smad2 and Smad3) and common mediator Smad (Smad4) bind to different regions in Ski and SnoN. Mutation of both regions, but not each region alone, markedly impaired the ability of Ski and SnoN to repress TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation and cell cycle arrest. Moreover, when expressed in chicken embryo fibroblasts, mutant Ski or SnoN defective in binding to the Smad proteins failed to induce oncogenic transformation. These results suggest that the ability of Ski and SnoN to repress the growth inhibitory function of the Smad proteins is required for their transforming activity.

Ski was originally identified as the transforming protein of the avian Sloan-Kettering retrovirus (v-Ski) (4Li Y. Turck C.M. Teumer J.K. Stavnezer E. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 1065-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Stavnezer E. Brodeur D. Brennan L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4038-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The human cellular homolog c-ski and the closely related snoN were later cloned based on sequence homology to v-ski (1Nomura N. Sasamoto S. Ishii S. Date T. Matsui M. Ishizaki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5489-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region of Ski is highly conserved among Ski family members, including v-Ski (>95% sequence identity) and SnoN (70% identity), whereas the carboxyl-terminal half of the molecule shows little homology among the family members. The N-terminal homology region is necessary and sufficient for the known biological activities of Ski and SnoN (6Zheng G. Teumer J. Colmenares C. Richmond C. Stavnezer E. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 7Cohen S.B. Nicol R. Stavnezer E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2505-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Compared with c-Ski, v-Ski is truncated at the carboxyl terminus (5Stavnezer E. Brodeur D. Brennan L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4038-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 8Sutrave P. Hughes S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4046-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, this truncation does not appear to be responsible for the activation of ski as an oncogene because overexpression of wild-type c-Ski results in oncogenic transformation of chicken and quail embryo fibroblasts (9Colmenares C. Sutrave P. Hughes S.H. Stavnezer E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4929-4935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the transforming activity of Ski is likely due to overexpression, not truncation, of the c-Ski protein. Consistent with this notion, an elevated level of c-Ski or c-SnoN has been detected in many human tumor cell lines derived from neuroblastoma, melanoma, breast cancer, and carcinomas of the stomach, chorion, thyroid, and epidermoid (1Nomura N.

In addition to up-regulation of ski expression, mislocalization of Ski may also contribute to malignant progression. Ski was found to be present in the nucleus in cells derived from normal skin or early-stage tumors, but localized in the cytoplasm in highly malignant melanoma cells (11Reed J.A. Bales E. Xu W.

Science. 1999; 286: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Through these mechanisms, Ski and SnoN repress the ability of the Smad proteins to mediate TGF-β-induced cell cycle arrest. Because the Smad proteins are tumor suppressors, we hypothesized that this ability of Ski and SnoN to inactivate Smad function may be responsible for their transforming activity. To test whether the interaction of Ski/SnoN with the Smad proteins is indeed responsible for the transcriptional repression of the Smad proteins and for the oncogenic activity of Ski and SnoN, we carried out biochemical and structural analyses to map the Smad-binding sites in Ski and SnoN. We recently solved the crystal structure of a Ski fragment bound to the Smad4 MH2 domain (44Wu J.-W. Krawitz A.R. Chai J. Li W. Zhang F. Luo K. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 111: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Based on this structure and on our mutational analysis, we have identified the amino acid residues in Ski and SnoN that mediate interaction with the Smad proteins. This has allowed us to determine whether Ski/SnoN mutants defective in binding to the Smad proteins can still repress Smad function and induce oncogenic transformation of chicken embryo fibroblasts. Cells, Antisera, and Constructs—Hep3B, a human hepatoma cell line (American Type Culture Collection), was maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 293T and Phoenix-Eco cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Ba/F3, a pro-B cell line, was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% WEHI cell-conditioned medium as a source of interleukin-3 (45Luo K. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4485-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Primary cultures of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) were prepared from 10-day-old embryos and cultured as described (46DeClue J.E. Martin G.S. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 542-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Liebl E.C. England L.J. Declue J.E. Martin G.S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4315-4324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CEFs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-10 supplemented with 2% tryptose phosphate broth, 1% chicken serum, and 1% bovine calf serum. Antiserum against N-CoR (sc-1609) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 was purchased from Sigma. Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged full-length Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 and FLAG-tagged full-length or truncated Ski and SnoN were subcloned into pCMV5B as described previously (17Luo K. Stroschein S.L.

Virology. 1994; 203: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Transfection and Retroviral Infection—293T and Hep3B cells were transiently transfected using the LipofectAMINE Plus protocol (Invitrogen). To generate stable Ba/F3 cell lines overexpressing Ski or SnoN, FLAG-tagged wild-type (WT) and mutant Ski and SnoN in the pBABEpuro or pMX-IRES-GFP retroviral vector were transfected into Phoenix-Eco packaging cells to generate retroviruses. 48 h after transfection, 2.8 ml of viral supernatant was collected and added to 5 × 105 Ba/F3 cells in the presence of 6 μg/ml Polybrene. Following centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 2 h at 37 °C, the cells were resuspended in 2 ml of RPMI 1640 complete medium and co-cultivated with the transfected Phoenix-Eco packaging cells. 24 h later, the Ba/F3 cells were removed from the Phoenix-Eco cells and cultured in fresh RPMI 1640 complete medium for an additional 24 h. The infected cells were selected in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin (for pBABEpuro) or by fluorescence-activated cell sorting based on expression of the green fluorescence protein (for pMX-IRES-GFP) (Sigma). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—FLAG- and HA-tagged proteins were isolated from transfected 293T cell lysates by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody-agarose, followed by elution with the FLAG peptide and analysis by Western blotting as described previously (18Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Luo K. Science. 1999; 286: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Endogenous N-CoR was isolated from 293T cell lysates by immunoprecipitation with anti-N-CoR antibody. Growth Inhibition and Transcription Reporter Assays—For the growth inhibition assay, 2 × 104 Ba/F3 cells were incubated with various concentrations of TGF-β1 for 4 days. The cells were then counted and compared with unstimulated cells to determine the percent growth inhibition (45Luo K. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4485-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For the transcription reporter assay, a total of 2.5 μg of DNA were transfected into Hep3B cells. To examine TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation, Hep3B cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of p3TP-lux or pLuc800 (a luciferase reporter driven by the 800-bp natural promoter region of the PAI-1 gene) (49Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 2 μg of SnoN or with various concentrations of Ski together with 0.5 μg of p3TP-lux. Luciferase activity was measured 16 h after stimulation with 50 pm TGF-β1. Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull-down Assay—Recombinant WT or mutant Ski was expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli as GST fusion proteins. To test whether these GST-Ski proteins bind to Smad3, 1.5 μg of GST-Ski immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was blocked at 4 °C for 30 min with bacterial cell lysates, followed by 0.2% bovine serum albumin in GST binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.25 mm KCl) (21Wang W. Mariani F.V. Harland R.M. Luo K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14394-14399Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The immobilized GST-Ski protein was then incubated with 293T cell lysate expressing FLAG-Smad3 for 1 h in GST binding buffer at 4 °C. After extensive washes, Smad3 associated with GST-Ski was eluted with glutathione and detected by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. Soft Agar Colony Assay—106 CEFs were incubated with 10 μg of DNA (FLAG-Ski or FLAG-SnoN in RCAS.BP) in the presence of 30 μg/ml Polybrene. 6 h later, cells were shocked with 25% Me2SO for 3.5 min. The transfected CEFs were passaged for 3 weeks, and the percentage of infected cells at this stage was >70%. For the soft agar colony assay, 4 ml of normal growth medium containing 0.66% agar was poured into a p50 dish to form the bottom layer (50Penuel E. Martin G.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). 104 cells were then suspended in 2 ml of medium containing 0.44% agar and overlaid on the hardened bottom layer. 4 ml of fresh medium containing 0.44% agar was added to the dish every week. After 3 weeks of incubation, colonies were visualized by staining with 0.1 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma) and scanned on a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet J300C to visualize colonies. Immunofluorescence—To monitor the expression and localization of the introduced WT and mutant Ski and SnoN proteins, CEFs growing on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The FLAG-Ski and FLAG-SnoN proteins were detected by staining with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, followed by Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies. Nuclei were detected by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. Positively stained cells were scored for each transfected construct and used to calculate the efficiency of transfection/infection. Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay—Smad4, Ski/Smad4, SnoN/Smad4, or mutant Ski and SnoN were incubated as indicated with the 32P-labeled Smad-binding DNA element (SBE) probe (2 × 104 cpm) at room temperature for 20 min in binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 80 mm NaCl, 35 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 300 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2% Nonidet P-40) (51Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Luo K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9431-9441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For antibody supershift assays, 2 μg of specific antibodies was preincubated with the protein complex at 4 °C for 30 min. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Pulse-Chase Assay—293T cells growing in p50 dishes were washed with 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking Met and Cys and pulsed with 0.2 mCi/ml 35S-express for 30 min. The cells were then chased in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's complete medium for various periods of time. Mapping of Smad2-, Smad3-, and Smad4-binding Sites in Ski and SnoN—A series of deletion mutants of Ski were constructed to identify the Smad3-binding sites in Ski (Fig. 1A, left panel). GST fusions of WT and mutant forms of Ski were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose and used to precipitate FLAG-tagged Smad3 from transfected cell lysates. Ski fragments containing either residues 1–241 (Fig. 1A, right panels, lane 5) or 241–441 (lane 9) interacted with Smad3, suggesting that, at least in vitro, there are two Smad3-binding sites in Ski. Because Ski-(1–241) associated with Smad3 with a much higher affinity than Ski-(241–441), the major binding site is located between residues 1 and 241. Further deletion analysis indicated that residues 16–23 are required for binding to Smad3 since fragment 16–728 bound to Smad3 to a similar extent as WT Ski, but fragment 24–728 interacted with Smad3 with a much lower affinity (lanes 1–3 and 8). Furthermore, mutations that changed residues 16–23 to alanine either abolished (16–19A) or greatly impaired (20–23A) this interaction (lanes 6 and 7). The minor Smad3-binding site has been previously mapped to the region between residues 241 and 323 (17Luo K. Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Chen D. Martens E. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2196-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Further analysis using deletion and point mutants of Ski showed that residues 316–319 are required for this weak interaction (data not shown). Mutant Ski-(241–441) with these residues changed to alanine no longer bound to Smad3 in vitro (Fig. 1A, right panels, lane 10). This minor binding site does not appear to be sufficient to mediate the Ski-Smad interaction or to repress TGF-β signaling in vivo. Mutant Ski or SnoN lacking the major Smad3-binding site but still retaining this minor binding site did not associate with Smad2 or Smad3 in vivo (Fig. 1, B and C, right panels), nor was this minor binding site alone able to mediate repression of TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation (data not shown). Therefore, we focused on the major Smad3-binding site in all subsequent binding and functional assays. To examine whether residues 16–19 in Ski are also required for binding to the Smad proteins in vivo, we mutated these residues to alanine (mS2/3) (Fig. 1B, left panel). Epitope-tagged WT or mS2/3 mutant Ski was cotransfected with HA-tagged Smad proteins, and their interactions were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 1B (right panels), mutation of residues 16–19 disrupted the interaction of Ski with both Smad2 and Smad3 (but not Smad4) in vivo, indicating that Smad2 and Smad3 bind to the same residues in Ski. This is not surprising since Smad2 and Smad3 are 91% identical in amino acid sequence. Furthermore, these residues are well conserved in SnoN because mutation of the corresponding residues in SnoN (residues 85–88, mS2/3) also disrupted binding of SnoN to Smad2 or Smad3 in vivo (Fig. 1C, right panels). The Smad4-binding site in Ski and SnoN was determined by mutagenesis and by structural studies. We have previously shown that His222 and Glu223 in Ski are important for binding to Smad4 (21Wang W. Mariani F.V. Harland R.M. Luo K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14394-14399Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of a Ski fragment bound to the Smad4 MH2 domain, both residues contribute to the extensive interface between Smad4 and Ski, with Glu223 generating an intermolecular hydrogen bond and His222 stabilizing the Ski structure (44Wu J.-W. Krawitz A.R. Chai J. Li W. Zhang F. Luo K. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 111: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In addition, several amino acid residues, including Trp274, Thr271, and Cys272, also make direct contact with Smad4 (44Wu J.-W. Krawitz A.R. Chai J. Li W. Zhang F. Luo K. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 111: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Mutation of these residues either individually (mS4W) or in combination (mS4HE) abolished binding of Ski to Smad4 in vivo in a co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 1B, right panels) (44Wu J.-W. Krawitz A.R. Chai J. Li W. Zhang F. Luo K. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 111: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These residues are well conserved in SnoN (1Nomura N. Sasamoto S. Ishii S. Date T. Matsui M. Ishizaki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5489-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Mutation of His266, Glu267, or Trp318 greatly impaired binding of SnoN to Smad4 (Fig. 1C, right panels). Taken together, our results indicate that the R-Smad proteins (Smad2 or Smad3) and Co-Smad (Smad4) interact with different regions in Ski or SnoN. Amino acid residues 16–19 in Ski or residues 85–88 i"
https://openalex.org/W2127550215,"One of the major regulators of mitosis in somatic cells is cdc25B. cdc25B is tightly regulated at multiple levels. The final activation step involves the regulated binding of 14-3-3 proteins. Previous studies have demonstrated that Ser-323 is a primary 14-3-3 binding site in cdc25B, which influences its activity and cellular localization. 14-3-3 binding to this site appeared to interact with the N-terminal domain of cdc25B to regulate its activity. The presence of consensus 14-3-3 binding sites in the N-terminal domain suggested that the interaction is through direct binding of the 14-3-3 dimer to sites in the N-terminal domain. We have identified Ser-151 and Ser-230 in the N-terminal domain as functional 14-3-3 binding sites utilized by cdc25B in vivo. These low affinity sites cooperate to bind the 14-3-3 dimer bound to the high affinity Ser-323 site, thus forming an intramolecular bridge that constrains cdc25B structure to prevent access of the catalytic site. Loss of 14-3-3 binding to either N-terminal site relaxes cdc25B structure sufficiently to permit access to the catalytic site, and the nuclear export sequence located in the N-terminal domain. Mutation of the Ser-323 site was functionally equivalent to the mutation of all three sites, resulting in the complete loss of 14-3-3 binding, increased access of the catalytic site, and access to nuclear localization sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2094907699,"NmrA, a transcription repressor involved in the regulation of nitrogen metabolism in Aspergillus nidulans,is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase reductase superfamily. Isothermal titration calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry have been used to show NmrA binds NAD+ and NADP+ with similar affinity (average K D 65 μm) but has a greatly reduced affinity for NADH and NADPH (average K D 6.0 mm). The structure of NmrA in a complex with NADP+ reveals how repositioning a His-37 side chain allows the different conformations of NAD+ and NADP+ to be accommodated. Modeling NAD(P)H into NmrA indicated that steric clashes, attenuation of electrostatic interactions, and loss of aromatic ring stacking can explain the differing affinities of NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H. The ability of NmrA to discriminate between the oxidized and reduced forms of the dinucleotides may be linked to a possible role in redox sensing. Isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrated that NmrA and a C-terminal fragment of the GATA transcription factor AreA interacted with a 1:1 stoichiometry and an apparent K D of 0.26 μm. NmrA was unable to bind the nitrogen metabolite repression signaling molecules ammonium or glutamine.

NmrA was unable to bind the nitrogen metabolite repression signaling molecules ammonium or glutamine. Neurospora crassa, Aspergillus nidulans, and other ascomycetous fungi are able to utilize a wide array of nitrogen sources, and many of the pathways involved are regulated at the level of transcription by pathway-specific control proteins. When the preferred nitrogen sources ammonium or glutamine are present in the growth medium with an alternative nitrogen source, the pathway for the non-preferred source remains inactive. This situation is known as nitrogen metabolite repression, and the alternate nitrogen utilization pathway is said to be repressed (1Wilson R.A. Arst Jr., H.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 586-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations show there is a signal transduction pathway that responds to the presence of ammonium/glutamine and targets the control of transcription of the genes involved in nitrogen metabolism.Two major classes of mutant affecting nitrogen metabolite repression have been isolated. The first class exemplified by the nmr-1 and nmrA genes of N. crassa and A. nidulans, respectively, has a partially de-repressed phenotype (2Dunn-Coleman N.S. Tomsett A.B. Garrett R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 697-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Andrianopoulos A. Kourambas S. Sharp J.A. Davis M.A. Hynes M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1973-1977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) implying they act as negative transcription regulators.The structures of the native form of the nmrA-encoded NmrA protein as well as a complex with NAD+ have been reported (4Nichols C.E.

Leslie K. Nichols C.E. Lamb H.K. Cocklin S. Dodds A. Hawkins A.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6619-6626Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Structural comparisons reveal that NmrA shows an unexpected similarity to the short-chain dehydrogenase reductase (SDR) superfamily (5Stammers D.K. Ren J. Leslie K. Nichols C.E. Lamb H.K. Cocklin S. Dodds A. Hawkins A.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6619-6626Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), with the closest relationship to UDP-galactose 4-epimerase (root mean square deviation for 251 equivalent α-carbons of 2.7 Å). Whereas UDP-galactose 4-epimerase has the conserved Tyr-X-X-X-Lys SDR catalytic motif (6Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 7Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar), in NmrA this is changed to Met-X-X-X-Lys. The loss of a key catalytic tyrosine implies NmrA is unlikely to be an active dehydrogenase. The N-terminal domain of NmrA consists of a Rossmann fold, which, despite lacking the characteristic nucleotide-binding motif Gly-X-X-Gly-X-X-Gly, is able to bind NAD+ (5Stammers D.K. Ren J. Leslie K. Nichols C.E. Lamb H.K. Cocklin S. Dodds A. Hawkins A.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6619-6626Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Prior to the structural work on NmrA, NAD+ binding was an unreported property of the protein that could not be predicted from bioinformatics or genetic studies. However, in order to assess the possible physiological significance of such binding, it is necessary to characterize the relative strength of NAD+ as well as NADP+ binding to NmrA in both their oxidized and reduced forms.The nit-2 and areA genes that encode the GATA-binding NIT2 and AreA proteins of N. crassa and A. nidulans, respectively, exemplify the second class of mutants. These proteins contain single zinc fingers and are required to stimulate transcription of genes controlled by nitrogen metabolite repression (8Rutter J. Reick M. Wu L.C. McKnight S.L.

Loss of function mutants are unable to use non-preferred nitrogen sources and are said to have a repressed phenotype in contrast to the wild-type repressible phenotype.The molecular mechanism of the signal transduction pathway responsible for nitrogen metabolite repression is complex and in A. nidulans includes control of mRNA stability mediated through the 3′-untranslated region of the areA mRNA and AreA-dependent re-modeling of chromatin domains (13Platt A. Langdon T. Arst Jr., H.N. Kirk D. Tollervey D. Sanchez J.M. Caddick M.X. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2791-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 14Muro-Pastor M.I. Gonzalez R. Strauss J. Narendja F. Scazzocchio C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1584-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In vivo post-translational modulation of NIT2 activity has been implicated, as in vitro the nmr1-encoded N-terminally deleted forms of NMR1 protein bind directly to the zinc finger region and the extreme C-terminal 30 amino acids of NIT2 (15DeBusk R.M. Ogilvie S. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 493-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Young J.L. Marzluf G.A. Biochem. Genet. 1991; 29: 447-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 17Xiao X. Fu Y.H. Marzluf G.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8861-8868Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The interactions were demonstrated in a qualitative manner by using the yeast two-hybrid system, as well as steady state techniques that included electrophoretic mobility shift assay and column binding using His6- and glutathione S-transferasetagged fragments of the NIT2 protein as a bait. No kinetic data nor the strength of the interaction with the wild-type NMR1 have been reported. Here we investigate the ligand binding properties of NmrA and show that it binds to a C-terminal fragment of AreA, the dinucleotides NAD+ and NADP+, but not their reduced forms, and not to the nitrogen metabolite signal molecules ammonium and glutamine. These properties of NmrA suggest a possible link to a redox-sensitive signal transduction pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Chemicals and solvents were purchased from local suppliers and were of AnalaR or greater purity. Enzyme substrates were purchased from Sigma, and molecular biology reagents (which were used in accordance with the manufacturers recommendations) were purchased from Invitrogen, Amersham Biosciences, BCL, or the University of Newcastle upon Tyne Facility for Molecular Biology.Molecular Biology and Biochemistry—Routine molecular biology protocols followed individual manufacturer's recommendations or were as described previously (18Maniatis T.

After suitable digestion, the DNA sequence was subcloned into the E. coli expression vector pRSETB (Invitrogen) placing it under the control of the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible T7 promoter. This plasmid was designated pRF48.Overproduction and Purification of the AreA 662 Protein—500-ml cultures of E. coli strain BL21DE3 pLysS containing plasmids pRF48 were grown to an attenuation (D 500) of 0.2 in rich medium at 37 °C in the presence of 50 μg of ampicillin ml–1 and 35 μg ml–1 chloramphenicol when 0.2 mg of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside ml–1 was added, and growth was continued for a further 4 h. After harvesting by centrifugation, the cell pellets were resuspended in 40 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; SDR, short-chain dehydrogenase reductase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid. 1 mm benzamidine (buffer 1), and following sonication a cell-free extract was prepared by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Proteins in the sonicate capable of zinc binding were adsorbed onto a 27.15-ml chelating Sepharose column that had been charged to one-third capacity with zinc and equilibrated in buffer 1. Loosely bound proteins were eluted from the column with a 100-ml step wash of buffer 1 containing 2.0 m glycine. Tightly bound proteins were then eluted with a 50 mm potassium phosphate linear 6.0 to 4.0 pH gradient containing 0.5 m NaCl and 1 mm DTT, and AreA-containing fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE and pooled. The pooled fractions were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 5 liters of buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, 0.5 m KCl, 1 mm DTT, 10 μm ZnSO4, pH 7.2, and subsequently concentrated 2–5-fold by pressure concentration using argon and a ChemLab concentrator in conjunction with a YM10 DIAFLO ultrafiltration membrane.Purification of NmrA—NmrA was purified using the protocol described previously (4Nichols C.E. Cocklin S. Dodds A. Ren J. Lamb H. Hawkins A.R. Stammers D.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1722-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).Circular Dichroism and Fluorescence Spectroscopy—The secondary structure of NmrA was probed by far-UV CD and the tertiary structure by near-UV CD spectroscopy. CD spectra were recorded from five accumulative scans at 20 °C using a Jobin-Yvon CD6 spectrometer (Longjumeau, France). Samples of NmrA in 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, were used at concentrations between 0.57 and 0.78 mg ml–1. Each spectrum was corrected by subtraction of a comparative blank, and the readings were repeated in the presence of 2.0 mm ammonium chloride or glutamine.Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at 20 °C in an SLM 8100 spectrofluorometer operating in ratio mode with bandwidths of 8 mm for excitation (280 and 295 nm) and emission (range 295–430 nm); 5-mm pathlength quartz cuvettes (Hellma) were used containing 500 μl of sample in 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.4. Samples of NmrA in 50 mm KPO4,pH 7.4, were used at concentrations between 41 and 46 μg ml–1, and the readings were repeated in the presence of 2.0 mm ammonium chloride or glutamine.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments at 25 °C were performed using a high precision VP-ITC system (Microcal Inc.). For potential small effector molecule binding studies, NmrA in the calorimetric cell (1.4 ml) in the range 80–163 μm was titrated with either ammonium chloride, l-glutamine, NAD+, NADH, NADP+, or NADPH dissolved in the same buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.2) at 1.5–4 mm initial concentrations in the injection syringe. Experiments designed to detect any heat of ionization associated with the buffer and NAD+, NADH, NADP+, or NADPH used 50 mm PIPES, HEPES, TES, or Tris buffers, 1.0 mm DTT, pH 7.2. For the study of protein-protein interactions, AreA662 in the calorimetric cell (1.4 ml) at concentrations in the range 37.5–50 μm were titrated with NmrA at a concentration of 454 μm in the injection syringe. The heat evolved following each 10-μl injection was obtained from the integral of the calorimetric signal. The heat due to the binding reaction was obtained as the difference between the heat of reaction and the corresponding heat of dilution. Analysis of data was performed using Microcal Origin Software. AreA662 is encoded by a fragment of the areA gene subcloned into the E. coli expression vector pRSETB and has a heterologous N-terminal additional sequence that contains 6 histidine residues facilitating purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (see above). As a control we purified the protein encoded by the plasmid pRF12 (20Lamb H.K. Moore J.D. Lakey J.H. Levett L.J. Wheeler K.A. Lago H. Coggins J.R. Hawkins A.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) by using the same method as AreA662 because it has the same N-terminal heterologous extension. When this protein was used in the ITC cell at a concentration of 35 μm, no heat exchange above base-line values was observed when NmrA was titrated into the protein solution. This control demonstrates that the heat exchange seen when NmrA is titrated into AreA662 in the ITC cell was due to a specific interaction between NmrA and AreA662.Differential Scanning Calorimetry—Differential scanning calorimetry measurements on NmrA were made using Microcal VP-DSC or MCS instruments at a scan rate of 1 °C per min and a protein concentration of 17.3 (VP-DSC) or 108 μm (MCS). Protein was dialyzed in 50 mm KPO4, pH 6.6, 1 mm DTT, and the dialysis buffer was retained to dissolve ligands, to dilute proteins, and for base-line controls. DSC experiments were repeated with addition of 3 mm putative effector (NAD+, NADH, NADP+, and NADPH) under otherwise identical conditions. Deconvolution analysis was performed using the non-two-state model using the Microcal Origin software.Protein Crystallization and Structure Determination—The NmrANADP+ complex was crystallized in form A (trigonal, space group P3221, one molecule per asymmetric unit) using the conditions described previously (4Nichols C.E.

X-ray data were collected at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France, on beamline ID29 using a wavelength of 0.99187 Å. The crystals were flash-frozen using 20% (v/v) glycerol as a cryoprotectant prior to data collection and maintained at 100 K. Data indexing/integration and merging were carried out using DENZO and SCALEPCK, respectively (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar).

NADH was initially placed in the same position as NAD+ as observed from the crystal structure with NmrA (5Stammers D.K. Ren J. Leslie K. Nichols C.E. Lamb H.K. Cocklin S. Dodds A. Hawkins A.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6619-6626Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The system was then subjected to conjugate gradient minimization in the presence of water (coordinates obtained from the crystal structure). The very similar structures of NmrA seen in different crystal forms indicated a relatively rigid conformation for the protein, and hence the NAD(P)H-binding site was fixed except for the following key residues: His-37, Lys-131 Gly-151, Tyr-153, Asn-156, and Tyr-276. As a control, NAD+ was also subjected to the same protocol.RESULTSNmrA Discriminates between Oxidized Dinucleotides and Their Reduced Forms—Purified NmrA was used in microcalorimetry experiments to quantify any interaction with NAD+, NADP+, NADH, and NADPH in HEPES, phosphate, PIPES, TES, and Tris buffers. The results of an ITC analysis (see Tables I, II, III) showed that NmrA was able to bind exothermically with 1:1 stoichiometry and moderate affinity to oxidized dinucleotides with an average K D in the region of 47 and 82 μm for NAD+ and NADP+, respectively. No binding of the reduced forms could be detected.Table IThermodynamic parameters for the binding of NmrA to AreA662 as determined by ITC at 25 °C[NmrA]aProtein concentration in injection syringe.[AreA]bProtein concentration in ITC cell.nKDΔHobsΔS oc c[NmrA] × KA × n (the stoichiometry parameter).μMμMkcal mol-1cal K-1 mol-1454500.97 (±0.003)0.28 (±0.02)16.2 (±0.08)84.5173454500.99 (±0.002)0.25 (±0.02)15.5 (±0.07)82.319845437.50.98 (±0.001)0.26 (±0.01)15.9 (±0.03)83.4141a Protein concentration in injection syringe.b Protein concentration in ITC cell.c [NmrA] × KA × n (the stoichiometry parameter).

Open table in a new tab The ITC results were confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments (using a phosphate buffer) showing the effects of oxidized and reduced dinucleotides on the thermal stability of NmrA in solution under similar conditions (see Fig. 1). In the absence of added ligand, NmrA undergoes an endothermic thermal unfolding transition with T m ≈ 48.5 (±0.5) °C and mean enthalpy, ΔH = 670 (±50) kJ mol–1. Although the unfolding transition is irreversible under these conditions, the ratio of calorimetric to van't Hoff enthalpies, ΔH cal/ΔH VH = 1.05 (±0.12) is consistent with cooperative unfolding of a monomeric protein unit.Addition of 3 mm NAD+ or NADP+ raises the T m by about 4 °C, whereas the same concentration of reduced dinucleotides has only a marginal effect (δT m ≈ 0.5–1 °C). For a ligand that binds to the native (folded) state of a protein, the increase in T m can be related to the dissociation constant (K L) and concentration of ligand, [L], as shown in Equation 1, δTm/Tm=(RTm0/ΔHunf,0)·ln(1+[L]KL)(Eq. 1) in which δT m = T m – T m,0 is the change in unfolding transition temperature; R is the gas constant, and ΔH unf,0 is the unfolding enthalpy of the protein in the absence of ligand (26Cooper A. Nutley M.A. Wadood A. Harding S.E. Chowdry B.Z. Protein-Ligand Interactions: Hydrodynamics and Calorimetry. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2000: 287-318Google Scholar, 27Cooper A. Allen G. Protein: A Comprehensive Treatise. Vol. 2. JAI Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1999: 217-270Google Scholar). By using the data from DSC in the presence and absence of ligand with [L] = 3 mm, this expression gives estimates for K L ≈ 0.15 (±0.08) and 0.37 (±0.07) mm for NAD+ and NADP+, respectively, compared with much weaker values of 4.8 (±2.7) and 7.2 (±1.1) mm for NADH and NADPH under the same conditions. This is consistent with the more direct calorimetric titration data and shows clear discrimination in binding affinities for the oxidized and reduced forms of these ligands. It must be borne in mind that the DSC data relate to ligand binding at higher temperatures in the region of T m where ligand binding affinities will be weaker compared with those determined by ITC at 25 °C. These ligand binding properties suggest the possibility that the binding of NAD+ may modulate some aspect of the in vivo activity of NmrA. We are currently engaged in experiments to test this possibility.Binding of NAD + and NADP + to NmrA Is Associated with Proton Uptake and Release—The ΔH obs values given in Table IV are the observed enthalpy changes. These values include any heats of ionization that may be associated with the buffers and the reactants. The possibility that the ΔH obs contains a component arising from heats of ionization can be checked by plotting ΔH obs against the ionization enthalpies of the buffers used. Fig. 2 shows ΔH obs plotted against the ionization enthalpies, ΔH i, of the HEPES, PIPES, TES, and Tris buffers. These plots indicate that NAD+ binding is associated with proton release, and NADP+ binding is associated with proton uptake. The ΔH obs values for NAD+ and NADP+ in phosphate buffer do not fit the trend of the plots shown in Fig. 2. The reason for this may be because the Rossmann fold has within it a pyrophosphate-binding site, and it is conceivable that phosphate can bind poorly to this site thereby acting as a weak inhibitor.Fig. 2Linear regression analysis of a plot of ΔH obs versus the heat of ionization, ΔH i, of the buffers PIPES, HEPES, TES, and Tris. Data from two independent experiments are shown. The closed squares for NAD+ binding and the open squares for NADP+ binding are generated from the data shown in Tables I, II, III.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Structure of NmrA Complexed with NADP + and Modeling Studies of NAD(P) +/NAD(P)H Discrimination—As a follow up to the calorimetry work that showed NmrA does not discriminate between NAD+ and NADP+ yet does in respect to oxidized/reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides, we undertook structural studies in order to rationalize such observations at the molecular level. First, the crystal structure of NmrA complexed with NADP+ was determined and refined to 1.7 Å resolution (Protein Data Bank code 1PDS). From the omit map shown in Fig. 3A, the NADP+-binding site is clear and is positioned in a similar overall location to NAD+ (5Stammers D.K. Ren J. Leslie K. Nichols C.E. Lamb H.K. Cocklin S. Dodds A. Hawkins A.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6619-6626Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) yet with a significant difference in conformation for the adenosine fragment of the molecule (Fig. 3C). A number of hydrogen-bonding interactions occur between the protein and the NMN fragment of NADP+ including Tyr-153 nitrogen to the nicotinamide oxygen, Gln-17 main-chain nitrogen to the 1 phosphate, and Arg-16 guanidinium to the 2 phosphate group. Further contacts with the nicotinamide include van der Waals interactions with Met-113 and ring stacking with the side chain of Tyr-153. Many of these interactions are the same as seen for the complex of NAD+ with NmrA. There are, however, clear conformational differences between NAD+ and NADP+ in the adenosine portion of the dinucleotides. In the crystal structure of NAD+ complexed with NmrA, the glycosidic bond of adenine, lies in the anti conformation and is set at 0° allowing the ring to make close stacking interactions with the side chain of His-37. NADP+ adopts a different adenine ring conformation to NAD+ due to the presence of the 2′-phosphate and in the complex with NmrA has the glycosidic bond of adenine residing at 91°; nevertheless, an equivalent ring stacking interaction of the adenine ring with the side chain of His-37 is maintained by flipping the latter by ∼180° as shown in Fig. 3C. In addition, there is a movement of the adenosine ribose via a rotation of ∼70° about the C-5′–O-5′ bond relative to NAD+, shifting it toward residue Gln-84. The different adenine ring position in NADP+ compared with NAD+ leads to the loss of a hydrogen bond to the Thr-82 side-chain hydroxyl. However, the 2′-phosphate of NADP+ makes interactions to the side-chain hydroxyl of Thr-14 via a water molecule.Fig. 3A, omit map for NADP+ in its binding site on NmrA.

https://openalex.org/W2040310721,"The carboxyl terminus (C-tail) of G protein-coupled receptors is divergent in length and structure and may represent an individualized cytoplasmic domain. By progressively truncating the A1 adenosine receptor, a Gi/o-coupled receptor with short cytoplasmic stretches, we identify two inherent functions of the C-tail, namely a role in receptor export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a role in G protein coupling. Deletion of the last 22 and 26 amino acids (of 36) reduced and completely abolished surface expression of the receptor, respectively. The severely truncated receptors were retained in the ER and failed to bind ligands. If overexpressed, even a substantial portion of the full-length receptor was retained in the ER in a form that was not functional. These data indicate that folding is rate limiting in export from the ER and that the proximal segment of the carboxyl terminus provides a docking site for the machinery involved in folding and quality control. In addition, the proximal portion is also important in G protein coupling. This latter role was unmasked when the distal portion of the C-tail (the extreme 18 amino acids, including a palmitoylated cysteine) had been removed; the resulting receptor was functional and transferred the agonist-mediated signal more efficiently than the full-length receptor. Signaling was enhanced because the coupling affinity increased (by 3-fold), which translated into a higher agonist potency. Thus, the distal portion of the carboxyl terminus provides for an autoinhibitory restraint, presumably by folding back and preventing G protein access to the proximal part of the C-tail.

The cytoplasmic face of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) executes the signal transfer reaction through interaction with G proteins and accessory non-GTP-binding protein components. The interface is composed of three intracellular loops that connect the trans-membrane helices and a fourth loop created by a segment of 8–16 amino acids adjacent to trans-membrane helix 7 (TM7), which is tethered to the phospholipid bilayer by one or two palmitoylated cysteine residues. In individual instances, each of the intracellular segments has been shown to contribute to G protein coupling and signaling (1Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The second intracellular loop (i2), which contains the conserved D(E)RY(W) motif and the third intracellular loop (i3), in particular its amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends, are key elements. Between receptor types and even among related subtypes, sequence similarities in the cytoplasmic domains are scarce; this variability suggests that, among the cytoplasmic segments, some are reserved for receptor functions more divergent than G protein coupling. The receptor carboxyl terminus varies considerably in length ranging from nil (in the GnRH receptor) to more than 200 amino acids (in the Ca2+/Mg2+-sensing receptor). Distinct functional properties have been assigned to individual carboxyl termini. In rhodopsin and the metabotropic glutamate receptor (subtypes IV, VI, and VII), the proximal portion represents an ancillary docking site for Gα and/or the βγ-subunit (2Ernst O.P. Meyer C.K.

In addition, some of these reaction partners have been implicated in alternative signaling pathways, e.g. NHERF and activating transcription factor 4 (11Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35185-35191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); hence, the C-tail may support the direct association with effectors, bypassing the cognate G protein. This role was exemplified by comparing the signaling properties of glutamate receptor type II and type VII (13Perroy J. Gutierrez G.J. Coulon V. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Fagni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45800-45805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Both subtypes are Gi/Go coupled receptors and they inhibit Ca2+-currents in neurons but differ in their channel subtype specificity (P/Q-type versus N- and L-type). Although receptor activation relies on productive G protein coupling, swapping the carboxyl-terminal peptide domain transfers the specificity in channel regulation. Taken together, these findings emphasize that the C-tail of G protein-coupled receptors has evolved as an individualized functional domain. The A1 adenosine receptor is one of the four receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) for the purine nucleoside adenosine. Adenosine is a primary messenger implicated in the endogenous defense against hypoxic damage and other forms of tissue stress, and the A1 receptor is its major target in brain, heart, and kidney. The receptor couples with high affinity and fidelity to Gi and Go, and most of its actions can be accounted for by G protein-mediated signaling (for a review, see Ref. 14Klinger M. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The A1 receptor represents a very small, perhaps minimal, version of a class I receptor (326 amino acids; M r ∼38,000 and, after deglycosylation, M r ∼32,000); short loops connect the transmembrane helices, and the carboxyl-terminal domain has only 36 amino acids, including a palmitoylated cysteine residue (15Gao Z. Ni Y. Szabo G. Linden J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The division of the C-tail by the palmitoylated cysteine in a membrane-proximal and membrane-distal section is reflected in the primary structure. In the distal segment, the net charge is negative because of a number of acidic residues (7 of 17), whereas the proximal part has mostly positive charges and hydrophobic side chains. In the cytoplasmic extension of trans-membrane helix 7, a cluster of hydrophobic residues is commonly found in many receptors. These have been implicated in the export of receptors from the endoplasmic reticulum as well as in the formation of an ancillary G protein docking site (2Ernst O.P. Meyer C.K. Marin E.P. Henklein P. Fu W.Y. Sakmar T.P. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1937-1943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 8O'Connor V. El Far O. Bofill-Cardona E. Nanoff C.

Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 232-242PubMed Google Scholar). Other sequence patterns, however, are not apparent in the A1 receptor C-tail. Specifically, it has been shown that the receptor is a poor substrate for G protein-coupled receptor kinases because the C-tail lacks the appropriate phosphorylation sites. It is therefore unlikely that, upon activation, the receptor becomes phosphorylated and binds arrestin family members. In fact, the A1 receptor is refractory to desensitization over a time frame of ∼12 h and does not internalize (17Palmer T.M. Stiles G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15272-15278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 18Olah M.E. Stiles G.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 581-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To define the role of the two parts of the C terminus, we have created a series of mutated receptors that differed by the length of the C-tail. Our data show that the segment adjacent to the seventh transmembrane helix is required for ER export. In contrast, the distal segment restrains receptor signaling. Removal of this portion increases signal transfer from the receptor to the downstream cognate G protein(s).

Tissue culture plates were from Greiner (Kremsmünster, Austria). All other reagents were of the highest available quality. Generation and Expression of Full-length and Truncated Versions of the Rat A 1 Adenosine Receptor—The cDNA encoding the rat A1 adenosine receptor (inserted in the pBC-A1dhfr vector, a kind gift of Dr. Martin J. Lohse, University of Würzburg, Germany) was amplified by PCR. Using the forward oligonucleotide primer 5′-AGATGGTACCATGTACCCATACGATGTCCAGATTACGCTCCGCCCTACATCTCGGCCTTCCAG-3′, seven modified cDNA fragments were generated that included an extended 5′-region coding for an N-terminally appended HA-epitope plus an upstream KpnI restriction site. The reverse primers were complementary to the 3′-end of the complete receptor cDNA or, alternatively, were designed to amplify truncated pieces of receptor cDNA (sequences available upon request). In addition, an ApaI restriction site was introduced at the extreme 3′-end of the newly generated cDNA. Annealing of the oligonucleotide primers was carried out at 65 °C, amplification of the cDNA at 72 °C, and the reaction proceeded for 35 rounds. Amplified cDNA fragments were then subcloned into a pcDNA3 eukaryotic expression vector using the KpnI and ApaI cloning sites. The integrity of each construct was verified by fluorescence DNA sequencing. The conditions for cell culture, transfection, and the selection of stable cell lines were as described (20Bofill-Cardona E. Kudlacek O. Yang Q. Ahorn H. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32672-32680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). HEK293 and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. The culture media was supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, β-mercaptoethanol, and non-essential amino acids. Cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Co-transfection of pEGFP-C1, a vector carrying cDNA for green fluorescent protein, served as a control for monitoring transfection efficiency. Stable cell lines were generated that expressed the full-length receptor and two truncated forms (A1RΔ18 and A1RΔ34). Stable clones were selected for resistance to G418 (at a concentration of 0.8 mg/ml) and were screened by radioligand binding; transcripts from the A1RΔ34 cDNA were identified by reverse transcription PCR. To assess the dependence of receptor export on the amount of receptor synthesized, HEK293 cells were transfected with increasing doses of receptor cDNA of A1R, A1RΔ18, and A1RΔ34. The transfection efficiency was kept constant by supplementing the transfection mix with irrelevant DNA (derived from a bacterial expression vector) to a final amount of 10 μg per dish. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and membranes were prepared. Reverse Transcription PCR—Transfected HEK293 cells were lysed in buffer containing 4 m guanidinium thiocyanate, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 1% β-mercaptoethanol. RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform followed by precipitation with 3 m sodium acetate, and the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol. RNA was recovered by centrifugation, dissolved in RNase-free water, and treated with DNase I. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using random oligonucleotide primers. PCR-amplification of the receptor cDNA was performed with the appropriate oligonucleotide primers. Positive clones were identified by isolating DNA of the expected size in an agarose gel. As specificity controls, the amplification of reverse-transcribed RNA was attempted with non-matching primers (oligonucleotide primers designed to amplify the full-length receptor); in addition, the reverse transcriptase was omitted prior to the PCR. Membrane Preparation and Protein Purification—Membranes from HEK293 cells were prepared as described (26Waldhoer M. Bofill-Cardona E. Milligan G. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 808-818PubMed Google Scholar). For reconstitution experiments and determination of the receptor-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange, plasma membranes were enriched by differential centrifugation (9,000 × g and 36,000 × g). Recombinant, myristoylated Gαi-1 was produced in Escherichia coli and purified from bacterial lysates as described (27Mumby S.M. Linder M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Oligomeric G proteins were purified from porcine brain membranes (28Nanoff C. Mitterauer T. Roka F. Hohenegger M. Freissmuth M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 806-817PubMed Google Scholar), and free βγ-dimers were chromatographically resolved from the α-subunits (29Casey P.J. Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (22Nanoff C. Waldhoer M. Roka F. Freissmuth M. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Radioligand Binding Experiments—Receptor-promoted G protein activation was determined by measuring the binding of [35S]GTPγS to HEK293 membranes expressing the A1 receptor as described (26Waldhoer M. Bofill-Cardona E. Milligan G. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 808-818PubMed Google Scholar). Cell membranes (∼20 μg) were resuspended in an 30-μl volume assay buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.01 mm GDP. Following preincubation (10 min at 25 °C) with the agonist N 6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA at the indicated concentrations), the reaction was initiated by adding [35S]GTPγS to a final concentration of ∼10 nm (specific activity 800 cpm/fmol). After 10 min, the binding reaction was stopped, and bound and free radioactivities were separated by filtration over glass fiber filters. Receptor agonist and antagonist binding experiments were carried out as described (26Waldhoer M. Bofill-Cardona E. Milligan G. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 808-818PubMed Google Scholar). Cell membranes were resuspended in an assay volume of 30–50 μl containing HME buffer (25 mm HEPES-Na0H (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm MgCl2) and adenosine deaminase (0.8 units/ml). The amount of membrane protein added was ∼10–20 μg if membranes were from stable cell lines or 50–70 μg if the membranes were from transiently transfected cells. The binding was allowed to proceed to equilibrium at 25 °C and was terminated after 60–90 min by filtration over glass fiber filters using a cell harvester (Skatron, Lier, Norway). Nonspecific [3H]DPCPX binding was determined in the presence of 5 μm CPA, and nonspecific [3H]CCPA binding was determined in the presence of xanthine amine congener (1 μm), which amounted to ∼10 and ∼5%, respectively, of total binding in the K D concentration range. Reconstitution of the A 1 Adenosine Receptor—Cells were pretreated with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml for 16 h), and membranes were prepared. Membranes (∼ 25 μg/tube) were incubated with increasing concentrations of Gαi-1 in the presence of 4 mm CHAPS on ice. For the binding assay, the detergent concentration was diluted 5-fold; the final concentrations of Gαi-1 were as indicated in Fig. 7B. Reconstitution was monitored by radioligand binding with [3H]CCPA (∼1 nm). The experiment was also carried out in the presence of an excess of purified Gβγ; this did not significantly alter the affinity for the A1 receptor, presumably because of the recruitment of uncomplexed βγ-dimer present in the PTX-treated membranes (30Jockers R. Linder M.E. Hohenegger M. Nanoff C. Bertin B. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Freissmuth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32077-32084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—Cells from stably transfected HEK293 cells were used for identification of the epitope-tagged A1R adenosine receptor; alternatively, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with receptor cDNA or a control plasmid 48–60 h prior to fixation. Cells were seeded into 10-cm plastic dishes and grown to moderate density. Growth medium was removed, and cells were washed with PBS and treated with 4% paraformaldehyde. If indicated, the cells were then permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 (20 min at room temperature). For antibody staining, clusters of ∼100–200 cells were insulated with a crayon. Then, cells were sequentially incubated with the following reagents: 2% bovine serum albumin; primary antibody (monoclonal mouse anti-HA (16B12) antibody or a purified polyclonal rabbit anti-PDI, both at a dilution of 1:200); and secondary anti-mouse Cy3-labeled or anti-rabbit allophycocyanin-conjugated antibodies (dilution 1:1000). Following each incubation, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline followed by a final rinse with water to remove salts and embedding with Mowiol. Exposure to fluorophore-labeled antibodies was performed in the dark, after which samples were wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent bleaching. Specificity controls included staining of untransfected cells, staining of receptor-positive cells with the secondary, fluorophore-labeled antibody alone, and employment of a nonspecific fluorophore-labeled secondary antibody in addition to the primary antibody. Confocal microscopy was performed under oil immersion using a laser scan microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 135 m). Nonspecific background staining with the anti-HA antibody was examined on cells transfected alone with pEGFP; amplification of the fluorescent signal was set to a fixed value for cells expressing the tagged receptor. Under these conditions, the pEGFP-alone transfected cells gave a blank image except when the amplification was drastically enhanced, which visualized cell contours. Immunoprecipitation of the A 1 Adenosine Receptor—Membranes prepared from cells stably expressing the full-length and truncated A1 adenosine receptors (A1RΔ18 and A1RΔ34) were solubilized with 10 mm CHAPS (the ratio of detergent to membrane protein was 4:1) in HME buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and protease inhibitors on ice. The membranes contained ∼2 pmol (∼80 ng) of full-length and A1RΔ18 receptor proteins. The insoluble material was collected by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was diluted 2.5-fold with HME plus 100 mm NaCl. The soluble extract was incubated with anti-HA antibody (12CA5, ∼ 5 μg) for 8 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose was added and, after 2 h at 4 °C, the material was collected by centrifugation. The pellet was washed briefly three times with HME buffer containing 4 mm CHAPS and 150 mm NaCl. The final pellet was dissolved in SDS sample buffer containing 6 m urea, and proteins were denatured for 12 h at room temperature. Samples were applied to a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (containing 4 m urea). After separation and electrophoretic transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes, blots were developed with the 16B12 anti-HA antibody. The immunoreactive bands were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies and an appropriate chemiluminiscence substrate. As a control, membranes from cells transfected with the pEGFP vector alone were subjected to immunoprecipitation. Determination of cAMP Formation—Receptor-dependent inhibition of cAMP formation in stable HEK293 cells was assessed as described previously (20Bofill-Cardona E. Kudlacek O. Yang Q. Ahorn H. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32672-32680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cells labeled with [3H]adenine (2 μCi/well) were stimulated with forskolin (25 μm), and receptor-dependent inhibition was determined after a 20 min incubation with CPA or R-PIA at the indicated concentrations. The assay was carried out in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram (100 μm) and adenosine deaminase (0.8units/ml), which were added 30 min prior to the assay. After termination by cell lysis, [3H]cAMP was isolated by sequential chromatography on Dowex AG 50W-X4 and neutral alumina. Alternatively, COS-7 cells (about 5–7.5 × 106 cells) were transiently transfected with the appropriate A1 adenosine receptor constructs and a plasmid encoding the human A2A adenosine receptor. 16 h after transfection, cells were detached with EDTA and re-plated in (typically 15) 35-mm dishes. Cells were allowed to attach and were labeled with [3H]adenine. Formation of cAMP was stimulated with the selective A2A adenosine receptor agonist CGS21680 (1 μm). In an individual experiment, cells expressing the intact and truncated receptor were assayed in parallel. Determination of Receptor-mediated MAPK Phosphorylation—Stably transfected HEK293 cells were grown to 50% density on 6-cm dishes and then kept in serum-free medium for 24 h prior to the MAP kinase assay as described (31Klinger M. Kuhn M. Just H. Stefan E. Palmer T. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2002; 366: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The starving medium was supplemented with adenosine deaminase (0.8 units/ml) and replaced with fresh medium 1 h before stimulation of the cells. The level of MAPK phosphorylation was evaluated by immunoblotting with an antiserum directed against the phosphorylated p42 and p44 isoforms of MAPK. The immunoblots were scanned, and densitometric quantification was performed using an image analysis system (Bio-Rad). Data are presented as percent of the maximum intensity gauged from the individual concentration-response curves. Fractionation of HEK293 Cells in a Sucrose Density Gradient—Stable HEK293 cells were grown to confluence on two 20-cm dishes, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and detached by scraping. Cells were pelleted, taken up in hypotonic HME buffer including protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Applied Science), and disrupted by a freeze-thaw cycle (i.e. snap freezing in liquid nitrogen followed by rapid thawing). Subsequently, membranes were further fragmented with a glass pestle homogenizer in a volume of 2.5 ml. The nuclear fraction was sedimented by low speed centrifugation (1000 × g); the postnuclear supernatant containing about 2.5 mg protein was mixed with sucrose to give a concentration of 40% and layered on the bottom of a 36-ml centrifugation tube. A discontinuous sucrose gradient was generated by sequentially adding 15 2.6-ml cushions of sucrose (range, 12–38%). Membranes were brought to their isopycnic flotation density by centrifugation for 16 h at ∼100,000 × g in a Beckman ultracentrifuge. Fractions, about 1 ml each, were collected by aspiration from the top using a Haake-Buchler pump. To avoid overloading, two gradients were generated in parallel. Fractions were screened for protein content (Bradford assay with the Bio-Rad protein dye) and radioligand binding for the distribution of the A1 adenosine receptor and the plasma membrane marker enzyme Na+-K+-ATPase. [3H]ouabain binding was performed on 50–100 μl fraction aliquots in a final volume of 400 μlin25mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaHPO4, 5 mm MgSO4 and 30 nm [3H]ouabain (32Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Tuisl E. Schütz W. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1989; 13: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was assessed in the presence of 30 μm unlabeled ouabain and amounted to ∼10% of the total binding in fractions enriched in Na+-K+-ATPase. [3H]DPCPX binding was carried out on 100-μl fractio"
https://openalex.org/W2114816825,"We established hepatitis C virus (HCV) core-expressing cells and investigated whether HCV core would modify the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator transcription factor (STAT) pathway under interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon (IFN)-γ stimuli. Phosphorylation of JAK1/2 and STAT3, and STAT3-mediated transcription, were prevented by HCV core under IL-6 stimulation. In contrast, HCV core increased phosphorylation of JAK1/2 and STAT1 and STAT1-mediated transcription under IFN-γ stimulation. Immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis showed that HCV core could bind to JAK1/2. The PGYPWP sequences at codons 79–84 within HCV core were important for interaction with JAKs by in vitro binding analysis. In the reporter gene assay, HCV core-mediated suppression of JAK-STAT pathway under IL-6 stimulation was not observed by abrogation of PGYPWP sequence, suggesting that HCV core/JAK interaction may directly affect the signal transduction. In contrast, augmentation of JAK-STAT pathway was still seen by HCV core without functional PGYPWP sequence under IFN-γ stimulation. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that HCV core up-regulated of IFN-γ receptor 2 expression, which may be responsible for HCV core-mediated enhancement of JAK-STAT pathway under IFN-γ stimulation. In conclusion, HCV core has different effects on the JAK-STAT pathway under IL-6 and IFN-γ stimuli. This may be exerted by these two independent mechanisms.

To understand the molecular mechanisms through which such biological functions would be exhibited, the modulation effect of HCV core protein on various cellular signaling pathways has been studied by several investigators. Tsuchihara et al. (14Tsuchihara K. Hijikata M. Fukuda K. Kuroki T. Yamamoto N. Shimotohno K. Virology. 1999; 258: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) showed that the HCV core protein enhanced the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway under epidermal growth factor stimulation. It has also been demonstrated by Aoki et al. (15Aoki H. Hayashi J. Moriyama M. Arakawa Y. Hino O. J. Virol. 1999; 74: 1736-1741Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar) that the activation of Raf-1 kinase, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase family, was exerted by binding of the HCV core protein to 14-3-3ϵ protein. Zhu et al. (13Zhu N. Khoshnan A. Schneider R. Matsumoto M. Dennert G. Ware C. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3691-3697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the HCV core protein became bound to the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, resulting in enhanced tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis by modulating the tumor necrosis factor-α-mediated signal transduction pathways. Furthermore, it has recently been shown by Yoshida et al. (16Yoshida H. Kato N. Shiratori Y. Otsuka M. Maeda S. Kato J. Omata M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16399-16405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) that the HCV core protein modifies the NF-κB-mediated signal transduction pathway. The Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator transcription factor (STAT) signaling pathway is known to be a major cascade associated with the signal transduction for many cytokines and growth factors. The interactions of these cytokines with specific surface receptors trigger the activation of JAK and then STAT. The activation of JAK and STAT depends on the phosphorylation at the specific tyrosine residues. There are four JAK proteins (JAK1–3 and Tyk2) and seven STAT proteins (STAT1–4, -5a, -5b, and -6). After phosphorylation of JAK and STAT, the STAT is dimerized, resulting in nuclear translocation. Most STAT dimers recognize the DNA element with the consensus sequence 5′-TT(N4–6)AA-3′ and regulate transcription of many STAT-responsive genes (reviewed in Refs. 17Boehm U. Klamp T. Groot M. Howard J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 749-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (2494) Google Scholar, 18Bach E.A. Aguet M. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev.

Curt M.H. Science. 2001; 296: 1653-1655Google Scholar). For example, IL-6 stimulation leads to the phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2, and STAT3, followed by nuclear translocation of the STAT3 homodimer (23Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar, 24Murakami M. Hibi M. Nakagawa N. Nakagawa T. Yasukawa K. Yamanishi K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Science. 1993; 260: 1808-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). In the case of IFN-γ, JAK1, JAK2, and STAT1 phosphorylation occurs, followed by STAT1 homodimerization and its nuclear translocation (25Pestka S. Semin. Oncol. 1997; 24: S9-S40Google Scholar). As for IFN-α/β, the stimulation results in binding of the interferon stimulatory response element (ISRE) with the sequence 5′-AGTTTN3TTTCC-3′, through the activation of JAK1, Tyk2, STAT1, and STAT2 and the conformation of interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 composed of STAT1, STAT2, and interferon regulatory factor 9 (26Darnell Jr., J.E.

Cell. 1992; 70: 313-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). A few investigators have so far studied the influence of HCV expression on the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in the host cell. Naganuma et al. (28Naganuma A. Nozaki A. Tanaka T. Sugiyama K. Takagi H. Mori M. Shimotohno K. Kato N. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8744-8750Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) revealed the enhancement of the IFN-α-inducible 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase gene expression by HCV core protein. It has also been shown by Markus et al. (29Markus H.H. Darius M. Hubert E.B. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8469-8475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that expression of the full-length of HCV ORF suppressed the IFN-α-mediated STAT/DNA binding activity. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of HCV core-mediated modification on the JAK-STAT signaling pathway have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the influence of the HCV core protein on the JAK-STAT signaling pathway under IL-6 and IFN-γ stimuli using murine cells constitutively expressing HCV core protein. The results of this study demonstrated that the expression of HCV core protein has different effects on the JAK-STAT signaling pathway; it causes inhibition in the case of IL-6 treatment or enhancement in the case of IFN-γ treatment of JAK-STAT activation. We also showed that such HCV core-mediated modulation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway was exerted by the two mechanisms; its binding to the JAK protein and the up-regulation of the IFN-γ receptor 2 (IFNGR2) expression. Plasmid Constructs—The mammalian expression vector pc/3EFpro was constructed from pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Tokyo, Japan) by replacing the cytomegalovirus promoter sequence with the elongation factor (EF)-1 promoter sequence in front of the multicloning site. The HCV core expression plasmid pc/3EFΔNCTH carried the entire core region and the part of the E1 region of the genotype 1b HCV strain downstream of the EF-1 promoter (30Tokushige K. Moradpour D. Wakita T. Geissler M. Hayashi N. Wands J.R. J. Virol. Methods. 1997; 64: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCore (1–191)-V5 was made up from the plasmid pcDNA3.1/V5-His A (Invitrogen) by inserting the entire HCV core region (amino acid positions 1–191) downstream of the cytomegalovirus and T7 promoters. Both plasmid constructs, pCoreMut-V5 and pCoreDel-V5, were generated from pCore (1–191)-V5 by site-directed mutagenesis. pCoreMut-V5 possessed the AGYAWA sequences instead of the PGYPWP ones at amino acid positions 79–84, whereas pCoreDel-V5 lacked the PGYPWP amino acid residues of the HCV core protein. Plasmids pCore (1–173)-V5 and pCore (1–122)-V5 carried the part of the HCV core gene (amino acid positions 1–173 and 1–122, respectively) downstream of the cytomegalovirus and T7 promoters. Plasmids pAPRELuci and pISRELuci contained the three repeats of the acute phase response elements (APREs) and ISRE upstream of the minimal mouse junB promoter and luciferase gene (31Fujitani Y. Nakajima K. Kojima H. Nakae K. Takeda T. Hirano T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Muraoka O. Tanaka H. Itoh M. Ishikawa K. Hirano T. Immunol. Lett. 1996; 54: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGASLuci, which included the two repeats of the γ-interferon activation site (GAS) and the minimal promoter from the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene upstream of the luciferase gene, was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Plasmid pRLtk, the seapansy luciferase expression plasmid, was obtained from Promega Co. (Madison, WI). Cell Culture and Transfection—A murine normal liver cell line, BNL CL. 2 (CL2) (33Patek P. Collins J. Cohn M. Nature. 1978; 276: 510-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), was maintained in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 0.25 μg/ml of amphotericin B in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For the establishment of cells constitutively expressing HCV core protein, CL2 cells were transfected with pc/3EFΔNCTH using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) (34Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4370) Google Scholar). Next, the cells were cultured in the presence of 800 ng/ml G418 (Invitrogen). After 14 days, G418-resistant colonies were isolated. Finally, three clones of HCV core-expressing cells were established (designated CL2 core-I, -II, and -III). In the present study, the CL2 core-I cell was mainly used for subsequent experiments. In some experiments, the results were confirmed in CL2 core-II, and -III cells. As a negative control, CL2 cells were transfected with pc/3EFpro and cultured in the presence of 400 ng/ml G418 without the colony isolation (designated CL2 mock). In this study, a human hepatoma cell line, HepG2 (35Aden D.P. Fogel A. Plotkin S. Damjanov I. Knowles B.B. Nature. 1979; 282: 615-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar), was also maintained in the same condition as CL2 cells. For the transient transfection study, 2 × 106 cells were seeded on a 10-cm culture dish and transfected with pc/3EFΔNCTH using Lipofectin. Next, the cells were incubated in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM, Invitrogen), containing the DNA-Lipofectin complex. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium was removed, followed by further culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. Finally, the cells were lysed and subjected to the subsequent experiments. Cells transfected with pc/3EFpro were also used as a negative control. Reporter Gene Assay—For the reporter gene assay using cells constitutively expressing HCV core protein, 8.0 × 104 CL2 mock or CL2 core-I cells were seeded in the 6-well culture dishes and transfected with 1.5 μg of the reporter plasmid (pAPRELuci for IL-6 stimulation, pGASLuci for IFN-γ stimulation, or pISRELuci for IFN-α/β stimulation) and 0.1 μg of pRLtk using Lipofectin. Next, the cells were incubated in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing the DNA-Lipofectin complex. Twelve hours after transfection, the medium was removed, followed by further culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. For the last 6 h, the cells were stimulated with 10 or 100 ng/ml of murine IL-6 (Pepro Tech, London, UK), 20 or 200 units/ml of murine IFN-γ (Pepro Tech), 50 or 500 units/ml of murine IFN-α/β (Sigma), or left unstimulated. In the cotransfection experiment using CL2 and HepG2 cells, 8.0 × 104 CL2 or 2.0 × 105 HepG2 cells were seeded in the 6-well culture dishes and cotransfected of 0.75 μg of the effector plasmid (pCore (1–191)-V5, pCoreMut-V5, pCoreDel-V5, pCore (1–173)-V5, pCore (1–122)-V5, or pcDNA3.1/V5-HisA), with 0.75 μg of the reporter plasmid (pAPRELuci or pGASLuci) and 0.1 μg of pRLtK. For the last 6 h, the cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml murine or human IL-6 (Pepro Tech), 200 units/ml of murine or human IFN-γ (Pepro Tech), or left unstimulated. Finally, the cells were lysed and subjected to the dual luciferase assay (Toyo Ink Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Both firefly and seapansy luciferase activities were measured with a luminometer (Lumat LB9507, EG&G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany), and the firefly luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency based on the seapansy luciferase activity. The relative light unit of the unstimulated sample was regarded as 1, and the fold activity of each sample was calculated. All assays were done in triplicate. Western Blot Analysis—For the detection of HCV core protein, CL2 mock and core-I cells at a confluent state were lysed in low salt buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) at 4 °C for 5 min. After centrifugation for 5 min at 5,000 rpm, the supernatant was used as the cytoplasmic fraction for subsequent experiments. On the other hand, the pellet was suspended in high salt buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 420 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2% glycerol) at 4 °C for 30 min. Next, the sample was centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 15,000 rpm. The supernatant was collected as a nuclear function. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were used for the Western blot analysis with mouse monoclonal HCV core antibody (East Coast Biologics, Inc., North Berwick, MN). For the detection of JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, STAT3, tyrosine phosphorylated JAK1 (pY1022,1023JAK1; pJAK1), JAK2 (pY1007,1008JAK2; pJAK2), STAT1 (pY701STAT1; pSTAT1), and STAT3 (pY705STAT3; pSTAT3), the CL2 mock and core-I cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml murine IL-6 or 200 units/ml of murine IFN-γ and then lysed with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm Na2P2O7, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Antibodies against JAK1, JAK2, and pSTAT1 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and antibodies against pJAK1 and pJAK2 were from BioSource (Camarillo, CA). Antibodies against pSTAT3 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), and antibodies against STAT1 and STAT3 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). As for the Western blot analysis, the sample was mixed with 5× sample buffer containing 15% 2-mercaptoethanol, 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1.5% bromphenol blue, and 50% glycerol, separated with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond P; Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). After blocking with milk, the membrane was incubated with the first antibody, followed by incubation with horse-radish peroxidase-labeled immunoglobulin as a second antibody. Finally, the immune complex was detected by an enhanced chemiluminescent assay (Super Signal, Pierce). Protein-Protein Interaction Analysis—To examine the binding of the JAK protein to HCV core protein, the immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis was applied in this study. From CL2 mock, CL2 core-I, and transiently transfected HepG2 cells, the cellular protein was extracted by the method described above. The lysates were precleared by the incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) at 4 °C for 1 h. Next, the sample was incubated with the beads coupled to the JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, or STAT3 antibody, or the rabbit nonspecific γ-globulin (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 18 h. The immune complex were eluted by being boiled for 5 min. Finally, the supernatant was used for Western blot to detect the HCV core protein as described above. To confirm the binding site of HCV core protein to JAK proteins, HCV core proteins possessing the wild-type or the mutated amino acid sequences were synthesized from the plasmid pCore (1–191)-V5, pCoreMut-V5, or pCoreDel-V5 by the in vitro translation method. The reaction was performed with the TNT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) and labeled with l-[35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). The cellular lysates from CL2 and HepG2 cells were extracted and mixed with the in vitro synthesized various types of the HCV core proteins. Then, the mixture was subjected to the immunoprecipitation using antibodies against JAK1/2 as above. Finally, the immunoprecipitate was separated with SDS-PAGE, and the gel was dried and autoradiographed. Northern Blot Analysis—The expression levels of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1, fibrinogen β-chain, and IFNGR2 mRNAs were analyzed by Northern blot analysis. The total cellular RNA was extracted from CL2 mock and core-I cells using an Isogen kit (Nippon Gene Co., Toyama, Japan) based on the guanidine-isothiocyanate method. The RNA sample were denatured and electrophoresed, followed by the transfer to the nylon membrane (Hybond N; Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was then hybridized with the 32P-labeled cDNA probe at 65 °C for 24 h, washed, and autoradiographed. The band intensity was quantitated with an image analyzer (BAS 2500, Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Flow Cytometry—CL2 mock and core-I cells were suspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% sodium azide and incubated in the presence or absence (for negative control) of the specific antibody at 4 °C for 1 h. Antibodies against mouse gp-80, gp-130, IFN-γ receptor 1 (IFNGR1), and IFNGR2 were purchased from Santa Cruz. Then, cells were washed and resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with 10 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz, CA). Finally, samples were fixed with 1% parafolmaldehyde and subjected to the flow cytometry. The expression level of the proteins on the cell surface was quantitated by calculating the mean fluorescein intensities. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using the non-paired t test as appropriate. p values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. HCV Core Protein Expression in Stably Transfected Cells—To investigate the influence of HCV core protein expression on host cellular phenotype, we tried to establish cell lines constitutively expressing HCV core protein. We first used the human hepatoma cell lines Huh-7 (36Nakabayashi H. Takeda K. Miyano K. Yamane T. Sato J. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 3858-3863PubMed Google Scholar), Hep3B (35Aden D.P. Fogel A. Plotkin S. Damjanov I. Knowles B.B. Nature. 1979; 282: 615-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar), HepG2 (35Aden D.P. Fogel A. Plotkin S. Damjanov I. Knowles B.B. Nature. 1979; 282: 615-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar), but HCV core-expressing cells could not be well established from these cells. Therefore, we next chose CL2 cells, a murine normal liver cell line, as the parent cell. The expression of HCV core protein was stable within at least 20 passages (R60 days) in these cells. Fig. 1 shows the expression of HCV core protein in CL2 mock and core-I cells. In the CL2 core-I cells, the 21-kDa HCV core protein was observed mainly in the cytoplasm and a small portion in the nucleus. HCV core protein was also clearly detectable in CL2 core-II and -III cells (data not shown). On the other hand, the HCV core protein was not detected in the CL2 mock cells. Modulation of STAT-mediated Transcriptional Activity under IL-6 and IFN Stimuli by HCV Core Protein—To examine whether the expression of HCV core protein would affect the activation of JAK-STAT signaling cascade under various types of cytokines stimulation, we first performed the reporter gene assay by transient transfection of the plasmids pAPRELuci (for IL-6 stimulation), pGASLuci (for IFN-γ stimulation), or pISRELuci (for IFNα/β stimulation). The induction level of APRE-dependent transcription activity under 100 ng/ml of IL-6 was 2.6-fold lower in CL2 core-I cells than in the mock cells (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, 200 units/ml of IFN-γ stimulation led to 2.2-fold higher induction of GAS-dependent transcription activity in the CL2 core-I cells than in the mock cells (Fig. 2B). In the case of IFN-α/β stimulation, no significant differences in the induction of ISRE-dependent transcription activity between CL2 mock and core-I cells (Fig. 2C). CL2 core-II and -III cells displayed the same tendency for the luciferase activities as CL2 core-I cells (data not shown). Next, the expression levels of the fibrinogen β-chain and the IRF-1 mRNAs were studied as IL-6/APRE-responsive and IFN-γ/GAS-responsive genes, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2D, the expression of fibrinogen β-chain was almost absent in both cells before IL-6 stimulation. But its induction level was ∼2.5-fold lower in the CL2 core-I cells than in the mock cells. As for expression of IRF-1 mRNA, the induction level after IFN-γ stimulation was 2.1-fold higher in the CL2 core-I cells than in the mock cells (Fig. 2E). Taken together, the activation of JAK-STAT signaling cascades was altered significantly by HCV core protein under stimulation with IL-6 and IFN-γ, but not with IFN-α/β. Influence of HCV Core Protein on Tyrosine Phosphorylation of JAK and STAT Proteins by IL-6 Stimulation—The reporter gene assay and Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of HCV core protein modulated the JAK-STAT signaling cascade differently under stimulation with IL-6 or IFN-γ. We thus examined the change in the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated JAK and STAT proteins before and after IL-6 stimulation in CL2 mock and core-I cells. As shown in Fig. 3A (upper panel), the degree of JAK1 phosphorylation after the stimulation was reduced in the CL2 core-I cells, compared with the mock cells. The induction level of JAK2 phosphorylation after IL-6 stimulation was also lower in the CL2 core-I cells than in the mock cells (data not shown). As for the phosphorylation of STAT3, it was also lower in the CL2 core-I cells than in the mock cells (Fig. 3A, lower panel). This tendency of phosphorylation status of JAK and STAT proteins under IL-6 stimulation was also seen in CL2 core-II and -III cells (data not shown). When the expression levels of the whole JAK1, JAK2, and STAT3 proteins were compared between CL2 mock and core-I cells (Fig. 3B), their levels were the same irrespective of IL-6 stimulation in both cells. Also, the expression of HCV core protein did not considerably affect the expression levels of JAK1, JAK2 and STAT3. We also studied the STAT3/DNA binding activity in the nuclear extracts from CL2 mock and core-I cells after IL-6 stimulation using the double-stranded DNA probe corresponding to the APRE. The STAT3/DNA binding activity was considerably reduced in the CL2 core-I cells, compared with the CL2 mock cells at both 1 and 6 h after IL-6 stimulation (data not shown). Influence of HCV Core Protein on Tyrosine Phosphorylation of JAK and STAT Proteins by IFN-γ Stimulation—The changes in the pJAK1, pJAK2, and pSTAT1 levels before and after the IFN-γ stimulation were further examined in both CL2 mock and core-I cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, the induction levels of the JAK1 (upper panel) and JAK2 (middle panel) phosphorylation after IFN-γ stimulation were stronger in the CL2 core-I cells than in the mock cells. As for changes in the STAT1 phosphorylation, its induction level was higher in the CL2 core-I cells than in the mock cells (Fig. 4A, lower panel). CL2 core-II and -III cells displayed the same tendency for the phosphorylation status of JAK and STAT proteins under IFN-γ stimulation as CL2 core-I cells (data not shown). We also investigated the expression levels of the whole JAK1, JAK2, and STAT1 proteins in CL2 mock and core-I cells (Fig. 4B), resulting in the same expression levels of these proteins irrespective of IFN-γ stimulation. As for the influence of HCV core on the expression levels of these proteins, it did not substantially affect their expression levels. In the nuclear extracts from CL2 mock and core-I cells after IFN-γ stimulation, the EMSA was also performed to examine the STAT1/DNA binding activity using the double-stranded DNA probe corresponding to the GAS. The STAT1/DNA binding activity was considerably enhanced in the CL2 core-I cells, compared with th"

Cellular folate concentrations are influenced by folate availability, cellular folate transport efficiency, folate polyglutamylation, and folate turnover specifically through degradation. Folate cofactors are highly susceptible to oxidative degradation in vitro with the exception of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, which may be a storage form of folate. In this study, we determined the effects of depleting cytoplasmic 5-formyltetrahydrofolate on cellular folate concentrations and folate turnover rates in cell cultures by expressing the human methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase cDNA in human MCF-7 cells and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma. Cells with increased methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase activity exhibited: 1) increased rates of folate turnover, 2) elevated generation of p-aminobenzoylglutamate in culture medium, 3) depressed cellular folate concentrations independent of medium folic acid concentrations, and 4) increased average polyglutamate chain lengths of folate cofactors. These data indicate that folate catabolism and folate polyglutamylation are competitive reactions that influence cellular folate concentrations, and that increased methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase activity accelerates folate turnover rates, depletes cellular folate concentrations, and may account in part for tissue-specific differences in folate accumulation.

The reduced tetrahydrofolates (THF) 1The abbreviations used are: THF, tetrahydrofolates; pABG, para-aminobenzoyl(poly)glutamate; αMEM, α-minimal essential medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MTHFS, methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HCF, heavy chain ferritin. serve as cofactors that carry one-carbon moieties for the de novo synthesis of purines (supplies the number 2 and number 8 carbon of the purine ring) and thymidylate (for the methylation of dUMP to dTMP), and for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine (1Shane B. Vitam. Horm. 1989; 45: 263-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 2Wagner C. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 23-42Google Scholar). Methionine can be adenylated to form S-adenosylmethionine, which is a cofactor and one-carbon donor for numerous cellular methylation reactions (3Selhub J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 217-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 4Shane B. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 1-22Google Scholar, 5Clarke S. Banfield K. Jacobson D.W. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge Press, Cambridge2001: 63-78Google Scholar). Impairments in folate metabolism can result from depressed cellular folate concentrations, single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes that encode folate-dependent enzymes, or secondary nutrient deficiencies, and these impairments modify the risk for pathologies including neural tube defects, epithelial cancers, and cardiovascular disease (6Bailey L.B. Gregory 3rd, J.F. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 919-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Biomarkers for impaired folate metabolism include elevated uracil content in DNA (7Blount B.C. Mack M.M.

These biomarkers are associated with risk for folate-associated diseases and developmental anomalies, but definitive mechanisms that underlie these pathologies have not been established (12Ueland P.M.

The regulation of total cellular folate concentrations is complex because it is influenced by uptake, polyglutamylation, export, and turnover (15Suh J.R. Herbig A.K. Stover P.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 255-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Carrier proteins (16Sirotnak F.M. Tolner B. Annu. Rev.

Although the expression of transport proteins may adapt to extracellular folate concentrations, there is no evidence that transport fully determines intracellular folate concentrations (22Kane M.A. Elwood P.C.

Chem. 1990; 265: 18272-18277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Folate turnover occurs by three different mechanisms: 1) newly transported folate monoglutamates can efflux out of the cell before undergoing polyglutamylation, 2) folate polyglutamates can be hydrolyzed to folate monoglutamates by the enzyme γ-glutamyl hydrolyase, then efflux out of the cell, and 3) folate can undergo catabolism, generating inactive degradation products (15Suh J.R. Herbig A.K. Stover P.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 255-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Folate catabolism is thought to be the predominant mechanism of folate turnover in both rat and human models (25Caudill M.A. Bailey L.B. Gregory 3rd, J.F. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 2613-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and directly affects intracellular folate concentrations (15Suh J.R. Herbig A.K. Stover P.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 255-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Cellular folate derivatives differ in the location and oxidation state of the one-carbon moiety they carry, and also by the length of their polyglutamate peptide chain (1 to 9 glutamate residues) (19Lin B.F. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9705-9713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular forms of folate also differ in their susceptibility to oxidative degradation, with 5-substituted forms of reduced folate being the most stable (26Lewis G.P. Rowe P.B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Suh J.R. Oppenheim E.W. Girgis S. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35646-35655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). 5-Formyl-THF, which is used clinically (Leucovorin™) to elevate cellular folate levels, is the most stable naturally occurring form of reduced folate. Folic acid, a synthetic form of folate found in fortified food and vitamin supplements, is also a stable form of folate. Unsubstituted forms of folate, which include THF and dihydrofolate, and the 10-substituted folates, are chemically labile and susceptible to rapid oxidative degradation in vitro (26Lewis G.P. Rowe P.B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Suh J.R. Oppenheim E.W. Girgis S. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35646-35655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). There are two pathways for folate oxidation: one resulting in the formation of dihydro forms of the cofactor (dihydrofolate, 5-methyldihydrofolate); the other resulting in the oxidative cleavage of the C9 –N10 bond of dihydrofolates and tetrahydrofolates resulting in the formation of the pterin derivative and para-aminobenzoyl(poly)glutamate (pABG) (15Suh J.R. Herbig A.K. Stover P.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 255-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Increased rates of folate catabolism and turnover can deplete cellular folate concentrations (27Suh J.R. Oppenheim E.W. Girgis S. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35646-35655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and may account for differences in folate turnover rates and total folate content that exist among tissues (28Scott K.C. Gregory 3rd, J.F. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1996; 7: 261-269Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29Eisenga B.H. Collins T.D. McMartin K.E. J.

Localized cellular folate deficiency can occur in the absence of whole body folate deficiency, and this phenomenon may result from accelerated rates of folate catabolism (9Yi P. Melnyk S. Pogribna M.

Increased rates of folate catabolism during pregnancy are established in rodent models, but results from human studies have been conflicting (34Higgins J.R. Quinlivan E.P. McPartlin J. Scott J.M.

Elucidating the mechanisms that regulate systemic folate concentrations as well as the folate content of individual tissues is critical to understanding the complex relationships among folate status, folate metabolism, and disease. Materials—(6S)-[3′,5′,7,9-3H]5-Formyl-THF (40 Ci/mmol) and [3′,5′,7,9-3H]folic acid (25.5 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Moravek Biochemicals, Inc. (6R, 6S)-5-Formyl-THF was from SAPEC, pABG was obtained from Sigma, and (6S)-5-methyl-THF was from Eprova. Fetal bovine serum, α-minimal essential medium (αMEM), and α-modification lacking sodium bicarbonate, folate, ribosides, ribotides, deoxyribosides, and deoxyribotides (defined αMEM) were obtained from Hyclone Laboratories. Cell Lines and Medium—SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, and cell lines expressing human methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFS) cDNA (SH-SY5YMTHFS1, SH-SY5YMTHFS2, and SH-SY5YMTHFS5), have been described previously (37Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The human MCF-7 mammary adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC catalog number HTB22) and cell lines expressing human MTHFS cDNA (MCFMTHFS1) have been reported (37Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For folate turnover studies, fetal bovine serum was dialyzed against 10 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C for 24 h with buffer changes every 4 h to deplete serum of folate and other small molecules. The serum was then charcoal-treated to remove any remaining folate. Determination of Folate Turnover in Cultured Cells—Cell monolayers at 75% confluence were washed with PBS, then labeled for 12 h in αMEM lacking folate and glycine but supplemented with 25 nm (6S)-[3H]5-formyl-THF or 120 nm [3H]folic acid. For the chase, cell monolayers were washed with 10 ml of PBS, trypsinized, and pelleted by centrifugation. The cells were seeded in triplicate (0.3–1 × 106) into 100-mm culture plates containing 10 ml of αMEM supplemented with 2 μm folic acid. Cells were harvested at defined time points, the medium was removed, and the tritium in the medium was quantified. The cell monolayers were washed with PBS and lysed with 0.2 m ammonium hydroxide. Tritium remaining in the cells was quantified using a Beckman LS 8100 liquid scintillation counter. Western Blot Analysis of Human MTHFS—Cells were cultured to 75% confluence in αMEM, washed with 1× PBS, then harvested by trypsinization. Cell pellets were lysed using 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, centrifuged, and protein concentration of the supernatant was determined. Protein extracts (60 μg/lane) were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, then transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride microporous membrane (Millipore) using a MiniTransblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). For detection of MTHFS, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antiserum (1: 10,000 dilution) consisting of polyclonal antibodies generated in sheep against a highly conserved peptide sequence of human MTHFS (37Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The membrane was washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, then incubated for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep secondary antibody (1:6500 dilution, Pierce) and detected using the Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce). The protein bands were quantified using ChemiImager 4400 from Alpha Innotech Corp. (San Leandro, CA). MTHFS Activity Assays—MTHFS activity was measured from cell extracts using a procedure described previously (37Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cell pellets were lysed by sonication and clarified by centrifugation. Cell extract was added to a cuvette containing 100 μm (6S)-5-formyl-THF, 10 mm MgATP, and 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and the rate of 5,10-methenyl-THF formation was determined by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 360 nm in a spectrophotometer. Determination of Radiolabeled Folate Incorporation in Cultured Cells—Cell monolayers at 70% confluence in 6-well plates were labeled for 12 h in αMEM lacking folate and glycine supplemented with 25 nm (6S)-[3H]5-formyl-THF. Cells were harvested by washing with 5 ml of PBS, trypsinized, and pelleted by centrifugation and viable cells (determined by their ability to exclude trypan blue) were quantified. The cell pellets were lysed with 0.2 m ammonium hydroxide, and the intracellular tritium was quantified using a Beckman LS 8100 scintillation counter. Determination of Total Folate Content and Polyglutamate Chain Lengths—Total cellular folate and folate polyglutamate chain lengths were determined by affinity/reverse phase HPLC as described elsewhere (38Bagley P.J. Selhub J. Clin. Chem. 2000; 46: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This two-column HPLC method first purifies folate derivatives from the extract using a folate-binding protein resin, and the second phenyl column separates the individual folate derivatives (38Bagley P.J. Selhub J. Clin. Chem. 2000; 46: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Folates are identified with a four-channel coulometric electrochemical detector. Measurements were made from cells cultured to 70% confluence in αMEM that contains 2 μm folic acid. Determination of pABG and 5-Formyl-THF Levels in Culture Media—Cells were seeded (1.45 × 107) into 100-mm Primaria culture dishes (Falcon) containing 10 ml of αMEM. Following a 2-h incubation to allow the cells to adhere to the plate, the medium was replaced with defined αMEM containing 25 nm (6S)-[3H]5-formyl-THF. Aliquots of medium were taken at various time points, clarified by centrifugation, then transferred to a new tube and stored at –80 °C until HPLC analyses. Reverse phase HPLC was used to separate folate degradation products from labeled folates present in the culture medium. Medium samples were spiked with a mixture of unlabeled pABG, (6R,6S)-5-formyl-THF, and (6S)-5-methyl-THF, then analyzed on a Shimadzu HPLC equipped with a diode array UV spectrophotometric detector and a Luna 5μ 250 × 4.6-mm C18 column (Phenomenex). A binary buffer gradient was used to separate degradation products from intact folate, with Buffer A consisting of 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 5 mm Pic A reagent (Waters), and 16% methanol, and Buffer B consisting of 100% methanol. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. The HPLC method consisted of 100% Buffer A for the first 30 min, 75% Buffer A from 30 to 31 min, then 45% Buffer A from 31 to 42 min. With this method, pABG elutes at 6 min, 5-formyl-THF elutes at 20 min, and 5-methyl-THF elutes at 37 min. For each analysis, 1.0-ml fractions were collected into scintillation tubes, and the tritium was quantified using a Beckman LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter. Determination of Folate Uptake in Cultured Cells—Cell monolayers at 70% confluence in 6-well plates were washed with PBS, then labeled for a total of 10 h in αMEM lacking folate and glycine but supplemented with 25 nm (6S)-[3H]5-formyl-THF. Cells were harvested in triplicate at the defined time points by washing with 5 ml of PBS, then trypsinizing, and pelleting by centrifugation. Viable cells (determined by their ability to exclude trypan blue) were quantified. The cell pellets were lysed with 0.2 m ammonium hydroxide, and the intracellular tritium was quantified using a Beckman LS 8100 scintillation counter. Northern Blot Analyses—The tissue distribution of mouse MTHFS mRNA was determined by Northern analysis using a “Multiple Tissue Northern blot” (Ambion). Each tissue sample contains 2 μg of mRNA. [32P]ATP-labeled probes were generated by asymmetric PCR amplification, using mouse MTHFS cDNA as the template and primers that amplified the first 416 bp of the sequence. The PCR amplification conditions for probe construction were 94 °C for 45 s, 59 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for a total of 30 cycles. The β-actin control probes were generated by linear PCR amplification, using human β-actin cDNA as the template and an antisense primer. PCR cycling conditions were supplied by the manufacturer (Clontech). Hybridization of the blot was performed as directed by the manufacturer (Ambion). The tissue distribution of human MTHFS mRNA was determined by Northern analysis using a Multiple Tissue Northern blot (Clontech). Random [32P]ATP-labeled probes specific for MTHFS and β-actin message were generated from the corresponding human cDNAs following the manufacturer's protocols. The metabolic role of 5-formyl-THF is not known. This folate derivative is unique because it does not directly participate as a cofactor in folate-dependant reactions but rather acts as an inhibitor of various folate-dependent enzymes (39Stover P. Schirch V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 102-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is synthesized in the cell through a second catalytic activity of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (40Holmes W.B. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20205-20213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is present in high concentrations in seeds, and accumulates to nearly 90% of total cellular folate during the sporulation of Neurospora crassa. Results from these studies have lead to the hypothesis that 5-formyl-THF is a chemically stable storage form of folate (41Kruschwitz H.L. McDonald D. Cossins E.A. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28757-28763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although not thoroughly studied, 5-formyl-THF is not known to accumulate in mammalian cells because of the enzymatic activity of MTHFS (40Holmes W.B. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20205-20213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). MTHFS catalyzes reaction 1 in the cytoplasm, a reaction that depletes cellular 5-formyl-THF concentrations (37Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and this is the only reaction known to metabolize 5-formyl-THF. MTHFS is expressed in many organisms ranging from bacteria to humans, which suggests that it may play an important role in one-carbon metabolism (40Holmes W.B. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20205-20213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 42Roje S. Janave M.T. Ziemak M.J. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42748-42754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 5-Formyl-THF+ATP→5,10-methenyl-THF+ADP+PO4Reaction1(Eq. 1) Previously, we reported the development of stable MCF-7 and SH-SY5Y cell lines that express the human MTHFS cDNA and display increased MTHFS activity (37Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To determine whether depletion of 5-formyl-THF impairs folate accumulation, the effects of MTHFS activity on intracellular folate concentrations and folate turnover was determined in these cell lines. Increased expression of human MTHFS protein was verified in these cell lines by Western blot analyses (Fig. 1). Densitometry analysis indicated that MCF-7 cells that express the MTHFS cDNA contained 1.8-fold more MTHFS protein compared with nontransfected cells (Fig. 1). The specific activity of MTHFS in MCF-7 cells is 6.0 ± 0.4 pmol of 5,10-methenyl-THF formed/min/mg cell extract, whereas the specific activity of MTHFS in the MCFMTHFS1 cell line is 11.9 ± 0.8 mol of 5,10-methenyl-THF formed/min/mg cell extract, consistent with densitometry results from Fig. 1. The SH-SY5Y6 cell line that expresses the MTHFS cDNA exhibited a 100-fold elevation in MTHFS enzyme activity levels compared with nontransfected SH-SY5Y cells as described previously (Fig. 1) (37Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Effect of MTHFS Expression on Folate Accumulation and Turnover—The effect of increased MTHFS expression on folate accumulation was determined in MCF-7 and SH-SY5Y cells. Cells were cultured with [3H]5-formyl-THF for 12 h and the accumulation of radiolabeled folate was determined. [3H]5-Formyl-THF does not accumulate in cells because it equilibrates rapidly into the folate cofactor pool (37Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Both MCF-7 and SH-SY5Y cell lines that express the human MTHFS cDNA contained 40% less [3H]folate compared with nontransfected cells (Fig. 2) when cultured in medium containing 25 nm [3H]5-formyl-THF. These results indicate that increased MTHFS activity decreases the capacity of two different cell lines to accumulate folate. Because folate accumulates in cells at levels that approximate the folate binding capacity of the cell (15Suh J.R. Herbig A.K. Stover P.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 255-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), the inhibition of labeled folate accumulation observed above may result from: 1) inhibition of folate uptake, and/or 2) accelerated turnover of newly imported folate, and/or 3) slower rates of folate polyglutamate turnover and thereby decreased concentrations of unliganded or available binding sites for newly imported folate monoglutamates. Mechanism 3 would not be expected to alter total cellular folate concentrations, whereas mechanisms 1 and 2 would be expected to deplete cellular folate concentrations. To distinguish between these mechanisms, the concentration of total cellular folate was determined under the same culture conditions that were used to determine folate accumulation (Fig. 2). The total cellular folate content was decreased by 40 and 28%, respectively, in MCF-7 and SH-SY5Y cell lines expressing the MTHFS cDNA relative to nontransfected cells cultured in medium with high folic acid concentrations (2 μm) (Table I). Therefore, increased MTHFS expression depresses intracellular folate concentrations independent of extracellular folate availability.Table IEffect of MTHFS expression on cellular folate concentrations and folate polyglutamate chain lengthsCell lineTotal folateMean polyglutamate lengthpmol/mg proteinMCF-727.2 ± 2.9 (100%)3.2 ± 0.06MCFMTHFS116.6 ± 5.0 (60%)aValue significantly different from nontransfected cells, p < 0.05 one-tailed Student's t-test.4.4 ± 0.35aValue significantly different from nontransfected cells, p < 0.05 one-tailed Student's t-test.SH-SY5Y39.1 ± 5.1 (100%)5.7 ± 0.12SH-SY5YMTHFS27.9 ± 1.8 (72%)bValue significantly different from nontransfected cells, p < 0.01 one-tailed Student's t-test.6.1 ± 0.10cValue significantly different from nontransfected cells, p < 0.003 one-tailed Student's t-test.a Value significantly different from nontransfected cells, p < 0.05 one-tailed Student's t-test.b Value significantly different from nontransfected cells, p < 0.01 one-tailed Student's t-test.c Value significantly different from nontransfected cells, p < 0.003 one-tailed Student's t-test.

Here we use a stage-specific preparation to test the roles of SNAREs, synaptotagmin, and SNARE-binding proteins in the mechanism of Ca2+-triggered membrane fusion. Excess exogenous proteins, sufficient to block SNARE interactions, did not inhibit either the Ca2+ sensitivity, extent, or kinetics of fusion. In contrast, despite a limited effect on SNARE and synaptotagmin densities, treatments with high doses of chymotrypsin markedly inhibited fusion. Conversely, low doses of chymotrypsin had no effect on the Ca2+ sensitivity or extent of fusion but did alter the kinetic profile, indicating a more direct involvement of other proteins in the triggered fusion pathway. SNAREs, synaptotagmin, and their immediate binding partners are critical to exocytosis at a stage other than membrane fusion, although they may still influence the triggered steps.

SNAREs, synaptotagmin, and their immediate binding partners are critical to exocytosis at a stage other than membrane fusion, although they may still influence the triggered steps. Exocytosis is a common cellular process defined by several transient, contiguous stages, enabling the secretion of cellular compounds. The mechanism of the defining stage of exocytosis, Ca2+-triggered membrane fusion, has been the subject of extensive investigation, and evidence suggests that fusion proceeds via a conserved mechanism (1Chavez R.A.

This model suggests that the SNARE proteins (VAMP/synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and SNAP-25) interact to form a heterotrimeric core complex consisting of a 4-stranded helical bundle (7Fasshauer D.

These interactions are modeled to be necessary and sufficient for membrane fusion. However, other evidence suggests that the SNARE proteins are not the minimal, essential machinery required for Ca2+-triggered fusion of native membranes (11Coorssen J.R. Blank P.S. Tahara M.

Postulated critical upstream roles for the SNAREs in exocytosis include (i) membrane targeting and initial attachment (16Pelham H.R.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 99-101Google Scholar, 17Schiavo G.

This preparation allows access to the entire membrane surface of CV, ameliorating issues of access to essential proteins at fully docked sites. In addition, CV contain defined homologues of the SNARE proteins and synaptotagmin (23Conner S. Leaf D. Wessel G. Mol. Reprod.

The constructs and fusion proteins (without transmembrane regions) were expressed and isolated as described previously (29Jarvis S.E. Barr W. Feng Z.P. Hamid J. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol.

Blank P.S. Tahara M. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1845-1857Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out in base-line intracellular media supplemented with 2.5 mm ATP and protease inhibitors (11Coorssen J.R. Blank P.S. Tahara M. Zimmerberg J. J.

The capacity of endogenous CV SNAREs to bind the recombinant proteins was assessed as described previously (29Jarvis S.E. Barr W. Feng Z.P. Hamid J. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44399-44407Google Scholar). CV membrane proteins were extracted by the methods described for rat brain homogenate (29Jarvis S.E. Barr W. Feng Z.P. Hamid J. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44399-44407Google Scholar) and incubated with the recombinant proteins bound to glutathione or nickel beads; bound CV SNAREs were identified by SDS-PAGE and high sensitivity immunoblotting (32Coorssen J.R. Blank P.S. Albertorio F. Bezrukov L. Kolosova I. Backlund P.S. Zimmerberg J. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 307: 54-62Google Scholar). SNARE Blocking Experiments—Based upon protein concentration (DC protein assay kit, Bio-Rad), the measured protein purities using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R stain (32Coorssen J.R. Blank P.S. Albertorio F. Bezrukov L. Kolosova I. Backlund P.S. Zimmerberg J. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 307: 54-62Google Scholar), and the average density (+1 S.E.) of CV VAMP (6710 copies/CV) (32Coorssen J.R. Blank P.S. Albertorio F. Bezrukov L. Kolosova I. Backlund P.S. Zimmerberg J. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 307: 54-62Google Scholar), the various recombinant proteins were added to CV suspensions at ≥75–100-fold molar excess relative to endogenous VAMP (∼1200–1600-fold excess over endogenous syntaxin). To permit full access and binding of the exogenous and endogenous CV proteins, these suspensions were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C prior to assessment of fusion (end-point or kinetic assays). Affinity purified polyclonal antibodies against the cytoplasmic domain of sea urchin synaptotagmin (1:100 dilution), sea urchin VAMP (1:100) (23Conner S. Leaf D. Wessel G. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 48: 106-118Google Scholar), and rat syntaxin 1A (1:200; Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, BC) were similarly tested for effects on function. Chymotrypsin Treatments—Chymotrypsin treatments of 400 units were carried out as described previously for other broad spectrum proteases (1 h, 25 °C) (15Coorssen J.R. Blank P.S. Albertorio F. Bezrukov L. Kolosova I. Chen X. Backlund P. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2087-2097Google Scholar). Chymotrypsin treatments of 50 units were carried out for 40 min at 25 °C. Following these treatments, CV were recovered and resuspended in base-line intracellular media supplemented with 2.5 mm ATP; final suspensions also contained 2 μml-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (Sigma) in addition to the standard mixture of protease inhibitors used during the preparation of CV suspensions (11Coorssen J.R.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2087-2097Google Scholar), using the Wallac VICTOR2V 1420 multilabel HTS plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Each condition was tested in sets of 3–5 repeats per experiment; data are reported as mean ± S.E. Curves were fit using SigmaPlot® (2001 for Windows) to establish the extent and Ca2+ sensitivity (EC50) of fusion. Kinetic assays were carried out essentially as described for end-point assays, with the exception that optical density measurements were made at successive 150- or 250-ms intervals after the rapid injection of buffer containing 200 ± 27 μm [Ca2+]free (injection time of 140 ms for 50 μl using the WALLAC 1420–251 liquid injector). Two-sample, twotailed t-tests were performed to determine differences of end-point and kinetic parameters between the experimental conditions. Western Blotting—CV proteins were isolated by organic precipitation using 1:1 acetone:ethanol (12Tahara M. Coorssen J.R. Timmers K. Blank P.S. Whalley T. Scheller R.H. Zimmerberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33667-33673Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE, electrotransfer, and immunoblotting were carried out essentially as described (32Coorssen J.R. Blank P.S. Albertorio F. Bezrukov L. Kolosova I. Backlund P.S. Zimmerberg J. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 307: 54-62Google Scholar), with the exception that blots were blocked with 5% skim milk/PBST (0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline) solution and developed using the ECL+plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Protein bands were visualized using Kodak Biomax Light film or digitized directly using the PerkinElmer ProXPRESS proteomic imaging system and quantified by densitometric analysis using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). As expected for such highly conserved, essential proteins (23Conner S. Leaf D. Wessel G. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 48: 106-118Google Scholar) (urchin and rat SNAREs are ∼70–90% homologous, including the coiled-coil regions necessary for SNARE interactions), recombinant SNAREs, and other presynaptic SNAREbinding proteins also bind to the native CV membrane SNAREs (Fig. 1A). Urchin syntaxin binds to the recognized syntaxin binding partners VAMP2, SNAP-25, synaptotagmin, nSec1, and cysteine string protein; selectivity is confirmed by the lack of syntaxin binding to recombinant SNAP-23c and SNAP-29c (Fig. 1A, top panel). Urchin VAMP binds to syntaxin 1A, rat VAMP2, and synaptotagmin (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). Binding of all three exogenous SNAREs to the CV membrane prior to fusion assays was also confirmed (inset, Fig. 1B). As in other systems (8Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M.

Neuron. 1996; 17: 781-788Google Scholar), recombinant SNAREs and SNARE-binding proteins were therefore used to block endogenous SNARE interactions (both cis and trans). The Ca2+ sensitivity and extent of fusion were not significantly different between buffer controls (EC50 = 19.0 ± 1.2 μm and extent = 96.5 ± 2.2% fusion; n = 22) and background controls (GST and His6, see Table I). Data for each blocking experiment were normalized and compared with a parallel GST or His6 background control. At >85-fold molar excess (relative to VAMP, the most abundant CV SNARE (32Coorssen J.R. Blank P.S. Albertorio F. Bezrukov L. Kolosova I. Backlund P.S. Zimmerberg J. Anal.

These exogenous SNAREs also had no significant effect on the peak rate of fusion when challenged with 200 ± 27 μm [Ca2+]free (Fig. 1C, Table II) or [Ca2+]free that elicits a submaximal response (24 μm, not shown). Adding combinations of SNAP-25 and syntaxin 1A or of all three recombinant SNAREs was also without effect on end-point assays, compared with parallel controls (within the 99% confidence interval, not shown). In addition, syntaxin 1B (ΔEC50 = 2.0 ± 0.4 μm and Δextent = 3.2 ± 3.2% fusion) and a constitutively “open” form of syntaxin 1A (28Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Südhof T.C.

Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1845-1857Google Scholar) showed no evidence for an effect of exogenous proteins on the ability of CV to contact one another (not shown).

This pretreatment with the serine protease chymotrypsin (400 units) significantly inhibited the extent of subsequent Ca2+-triggered fusion by ∼80% (n = 8; Fig. 2A). However, this substantial inhibition of fusion occurred despite limited effects on total SNARE densities; 52 ± 3%, 53 ± 1%, and 33 ± 5% syntaxin, SNAP-25, and VAMP, respectively, remained following the chymotrypsin treatment (inset, Fig. 2A). If the SNAREs are essential to fusion, the SNARE densities remaining after chymotrypsin treatment should be sufficient to support full fusion (15Coorssen J.R. Blank P.S. Albertorio F. Bezrukov L. Kolosova I. Chen X. Backlund P. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2087-2097Google Scholar, 38Hua Y. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8065-8070Google Scholar). As syntaxin is the limiting native SNARE at ∼330 syntaxin/CV (32Coorssen J.R. Blank P.S. Albertorio F. Bezrukov L. Kolosova I. Backlund P.S. Zimmerberg J. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 307: 54-62Google Scholar), then ∼172 syntaxin/CV (∼52 syntaxin/μm2) remain after chymotrypsin treatment, easily fulfilling the estimated need for three syntaxincontaining complexes/release site (38Hua Y. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8065-8070Google Scholar); ∼1800 VAMP/CV (∼550 VAMP/μm2) and ∼380 SNAP-25/CV (∼115 SNAP-25/μm2) also remained after treatment. Yet fusion is all but abolished following the treatments with chymotrypsin. Conversely, treatment of CV with 50 units of chymotrypsin does not decrease extent of fusion nor alter Ca2+ sensitivity (ΔEC50 = 1.5 μm; n = 4) (Fig. 2B) but does significantly reduce the peak rate of fusion from 17.1 ± 4.5%/s to 2.4 ± 0.9%/s (n = 4) (Fig. 2C), despite a limited effect on SNARE densities; 52 ± 7%, 64 ± 3%, and 47 ± 3% syntaxin, SNAP-25, and VAMP, respectively, remained following treatment by 50 units of chymotrypsin. In addition, synaptotagmin is not substantially affected by chymotrypsin treatment (82 ± 6%; n = 4 remained following treatment by 50 or 400 units). The altered kinetic profile of CV fusion suggests an alternate chymotrypsin target that is closer to the fusion step than are the SNAREs. By all available criteria, fully primed and release-ready CV are “locked” at a step in the exocytotic pathway that is downstream of critical SNARE interactions but immediately preceding Ca2+ triggering (11Coorssen J.R. Blank P.S. Tahara M. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1845-1857Google Scholar, 12Tahara M. Coorssen J.R. Timmers K. Blank P.S. Whalley T. Scheller R.H. Zimmerberg J. J. Biol.

Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 303-314Google Scholar); essentially, this is equivalent to the rapidly (immediately) releasable pool of vesicles in neuroendocrine cells (39Yang Y. Udayasankar S.

Even after removal from their docking sites on the plasma membrane, isolated CV remain primed and fully fusion-competent, in the absence of cytosolic factors (11Coorssen J.R. Blank P.S. Tahara M. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1845-1857Google Scholar, 12Tahara M. Coorssen J.R. Timmers K. Blank P.S. Whalley T. Scheller R.H. Zimmerberg J. J. Biol.

As any decrease in the density of a protein essential to triggered fusion is expected to inhibit the rate of fusion (41Vogel S.S. Blank P.S. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 329-338Google Scholar, 42Blank P.S. Vogel S.S. Malley J.D. Zimmerberg J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 145-155Google Scholar), we tested the roles of different presynaptic proteins in the Ca2+-triggered steps of fusion by reducing their effective concentrations (and thus critical interactions) with excess recombinant binding partners. Although SNAP-25 naturally lacks a transmembrane domain and therefore may still functionally interact with native SNAREs when added exogenously, this may be less likely as the recombinant lacks the acyl modifications necessary for membrane anchoring. There were no effects on the rate, Ca2+ sensitivity, or extent of triggered fusion; protease treatments directly confirmed the dissociation of fusion from SNARE densities (Fig. 2) (15Coorssen J.R. Blank P.S. Albertorio F. Bezrukov L. Kolosova I. Chen X. Backlund P. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2087-2097Google Scholar). We have previously shown that fusion (at maximal [Ca2+]free) is independent of CV syntaxin density (15Coorssen J.R. Blank P.S. Albertorio F. Bezrukov L. Kolosova I. Chen X. Backlund P. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2087-2097Google Scholar). Here we show that fusion kinetics can be altered despite limited changes in SNARE protein densities. The differential effects of chymotrypsin doses on function but minimal effects on synaptotagmin densities confirm the results of the blocking experiments with recombinant synaptotagmin (Fig. 1 and Table I) and synaptotagmin antibodies, suggesting that synaptotagmin is not essential to the fusion mechanism. Thus, despite isolation from their fully docked state at the plasma membrane, CV do not require additional or repeated intermembrane SNARE interactions to support Ca2+-triggered fusion as rapid as seen in other secretory cell types (15Coorssen J.R.

Südhof T.C. Neher E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11680-11685Google Scholar). In addition, the results argue against synaptotagmin as the Ca2+ sensor for triggered fusion. The data are consistent with the hypothesis presented by Voets et al. (43Voets T. Moser T. Lund P.E. Chow R.H. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Neher E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11680-11685Google Scholar), suggesting that synaptotagmin influences the transition of a vesicle into the readily releasable pool; such a function would already have occurred in the population of fully release-ready CV. Although not clearly defined, the state of readiness established by intermembrane SNARE binding in vivo or of SNARE interactions with other identified presynaptic proteins outlasts the actual physical interactions of these proteins. Although essential to exocytosis as a whole (determined by the use of clostridial toxins (44Schiavo G. Matteoli M. Montecucco C. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 717-766Google Scholar)), at pre-fusion steps, these functions are not essential to the actual molecular interactions that drive the structural rearrangements inherent to membrane merger. The results are therefore most consistent with the notion that other essential proteins function downstream of SNARE interactions to effect the actual triggered membrane fusion step(s) of exocytosis (12Tahara M. Coorssen J.R. Timmers K. Blank P.S. Whalley T. Scheller R.H. Zimmerberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33667-33673Google Scholar, 14Peters C. Bayer M.J. Buhler S. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Mayer A.

Thus, considering the data presented here and that from a variety of other (semi)intact secretory cells, intermembrane “zippering” of SNARE complexes does not drive native fusion but may represent the final step of priming, a critical series of reactions enabling subsequent efficient triggered fusion, a function already fulfilled in fully docked and fusion-ready CV. This primed state may be analogous to previously postulated “tight” SNARE complexes (26Xu T. Rammner B. Margittai M. Artalejo A.R. Neher E. Jahn R. Cell. 1999; 99: 713-722Google Scholar); although this stage can be rapid and transient, as seen in secretory cells undergoing high rates of fusion, it is also clearly separated from the fusion step. Thus, identified presynaptic proteins (Table I), including synaptotagmin, have critical roles elsewhere in the exocytotic pathway, perhaps involving modulation at the plasma membrane docking site.

MTF-1 knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts were transfected with expression vectors for FLAG-tagged MTF-1 (MTF-1flag) or finger deletion mutants of MTF-1flag and then assayed for metal induction of MT-I gene expression, nuclear translocation, and in vitro DNA-binding activity of MTF-1 and its stable association with the endogenous chromosomal MT-I promoter. Intact MTF-1flag restored metal responsiveness of the MT-I gene, underwent nuclear translocation, displayed increased in vitro DNA binding in response to zinc and less so to cadmium, and rapidly formed a stable complex with the MT-I promoter chromatin in response to both of these metals. In contrast, although deletion of finger 1, fingers 5 and 6, or finger 6 only had variable effects on the nuclear localization and in vitro DNA-binding activity of MTF-1, each of these finger-deletion mutants severely attenuated metal-induced MTF-1 binding to the MT-I promoter chromatin and activation of the endogenous MT-I gene.

Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This suggests a model in which MTF-1 senses free zinc, adopts a reversible DNA-binding conformation, moves to the nucleus, and activates gene expression by associating with the promoter (12Lichtlen P.

However, cadmium, a more potent inducer of MT-I gene expression than zinc, is less effective than zinc at driving MTF-1 to the nucleus (4Smirnova I.V. Bittel D.C. Ravindra R. Jiang H. Andrews G.K. J.

Furthermore, studies of the metalloregulatory activity of mouse MTF-1 in yeast demonstrated that MTF-1 can function as a zinc sensor but not as a cadmium sensor in this system (14Daniels P.J. Bittel D. Smirnova I.V. Winge D. Andrews G.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3130-3140Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that distinct co-activators or signal transduction cascades are required to mediate MTF-1 activation by zinc versus cadmium. In that regard it has been shown recently (15LaRochelle O. Gagne V. Charron J. Soh J.W. Seguin C. J. Biol.

Thus, the mechanism of action of MTF-1 appears to involve several potential metal-specific regulatory steps that are not well defined. MTF-1 is a zinc finger transcription factor in the Cys2His2 family (18Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W.

Similarly, studies of the metalloregulatory activity of mouse MTF-1 in yeast did not reveal a function for fingers 5 and 6 (14Daniels P.J. Bittel D. Smirnova I.V. Winge D. Andrews G.K.

However, these zinc fingers are highly conserved during evolution and must be of functional importance in MTF-1. Although the in vivo roles of the putative metal-sensing zinc fingers of MTF-1 remain unknown, it is clear that the zinc finger domain of MTF-1 plays a crucial role in its responses to both zinc and cadmium. An intrinsic disadvantage of using reporter genes in transient transfection studies is that the reporter gene is not packaged into chromatin. Chromatin structure has been shown to play an important role in MT-I gene expression. DNase-I-hypersensitive sites in regions flanking the mouse MT-I and MT-II genes confer position-independent expression to reporter transgenes (28Palmiter R.D. Sandgren E.P. Koeller D.M. Brinster R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5266-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and may represent locus control regions in the MT gene locus. DNA methylation and histone acetylation have been suggested in MT-I gene silencing and re-activation in mouse lymphosarcoma cells, respectively (10Ghoshal K. Datta J. Majumder S. Bai S.M. Dong X.C.

Therefore, we hypothesized that zinc fingers 5 and 6 of MTF-1 may play a role in its metal-sensing functions on native chromatin templates. Here we examined the roles of the putative metal-sensing zinc fingers of mouse MTF-1 in the metal-dependent regulation of expression of the endogenous, chromatin packaged MT-I gene. Evidence is presented that the metal-induced recruitment of MTF-1 to the MT-I promoter and formation of a stable MTF-1-chromatin complex is a rate-limiting step in zinc- as well as cadmium-induced activation of gene expression by MTF-1, and that MTF-1 zinc fingers 1, 5, and 6 play an essential role in this process. RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from CD-1 mouse liver using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, CD-1 mouse livers were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in TRIzol reagent. Total RNA was recovered from the aqueous phase, precipitated in isopropyl alcohol, and reconstituted in RNase-free water. 1 μg of total RNA was used in reverse transcription reactions with oligo(dT)15 primer (Promega, Madison, WI) or mouse MTF-1-specific primer 1169as (5′-AAACTGTCAATCAAGGCAGC-3′). PCR was carried out with primer sets covering nucleotide –1 to +1169 or +1600 to +2131 (relative to the translation initiation site). PCR products were cloned into a pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), and individual clones were then sequenced for polymorphisms. Plasmid Constructions—FLAG-tagged MTF-1 cDNA was generated as described previously (4Smirnova I.V. Bittel D.C. Ravindra R. Jiang H. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9377-9384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The expression vector for MTF-1flag* (pcDNA3.1/Hygro(+)-MTF-1flag*) with the two changes in the zinc finger domain (R164Q and L181F) was constructed by ligating a HindIII/KpnI fragment of a pCMV-MTF-1 clone (26Bittel D.C. Smirnova I. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37194-37201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the KpnI/BstXI fragment of a pCR2.1-MTF-1flag* into a pcDNA3.1/Hygro(+) vector (Invitrogen). The expression vector for MTF-1flag with the consensus zinc finger domain was constructed by replacing the KpnI/MscI fragment of MTF-1flag* with the KpnI/MscI fragment of EST 1528077 (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Expression vectors for MTF-1flag finger-deletion mutants, D1flag, D5&6flag, and D6flag were constructed by replacing the HindIII/MscI fragment of MTF-1flag with the HindIII/MscI fragment of these deletion mutants in pGem7 vectors described previously (26Bittel D.C. Smirnova I. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37194-37201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), respectively. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture—Wild type mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and MTF-1 knockout MEFs derived from MTF-1–/– mice (MTF-KO) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Stable cell lines expressing mouse MTF-1flag and its finger-deletion mutants were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Transient Transfections—MTF-KO cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE PLUS and LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were plated in 10-cm dishes so that they were 70–90% confluent at the time of transfection. The next morning, DNA-PLUS-LipofectAMINE reagent complexes were prepared as recommended in a volume of 1.5 ml containing expression vectors (0.1–8.1 μg) for mouse MTF-1flag or its finger-deletion mutants. A green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression vector (9 μg) pEGFP-C2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was included in each transfection as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The complexes were added directly to cells in fresh serum-free medium. After 5 h of incubation, DMEM with 20% FBS was added to bring up the final serum concentration to 10%. The following morning, the cells were split 1:2 into two 10-cm dishes. Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) from untreated cells or cells treated for 12 h with 100 μm ZnSO4. Stable cell lines were generated by transfecting MTF-KO cells, as described above, with expression vectors coding for mouse MTF-1flag or its finger-deletion mutants. All expression vectors carry the hygromycin resistance gene. The transfected cells were selected in 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Pools of stably transfected cells were collected after 7–10 days of selection. Single colonies of stably transfected cells were picked after 2 weeks of selection, and expression was confirmed by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Two independent cell lines for each construct were analyzed. Northern Blotting—Cells (80–90% confluency) were treated with ZnSO4 or CdCl2, as indicated, prior to harvest. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), separated by denaturing agaroseformaldehyde gel electrophoresis, transferred, and UV cross-linked to Nytran Supercharge nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Northern Blots were prehybridized, hybridized with an MT-I cRNA probe, and washed as described previously (31Dalton T.P. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5016-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Hybrids were detected by autoradiography at –70 °C with intensifying screens and quantitated using the Packard Cyclone Storage Phosphor System (Packard, Meriden, CT). A β-actin cRNA probe was used as a control to normalize for RNA amount, integrity, and transfer efficiency. Preparation of Nuclear, Cytoplasmic, and Whole Cell Extracts—Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from cells (80–90% confluent), untreated or treated for 1 h with ZnSO4 (100 μm) or CdCl2 (10 or 20 μm), as described previously (6Dalton T.P. Li Q.W. Bittel D. Liang L.C. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26233-26241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, the cells were collected in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in cell lysis buffer (6Dalton T.P. Li Q.W. Bittel D. Liang L.C. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26233-26241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Nuclei were collected, and supernatant was saved as a cytoplasmic extract. The nuclei, resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer, were stirred on ice for 30 min and centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected as nuclear extract (6Dalton T.P. Li Q.W. Bittel D. Liang L.C. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26233-26241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic extracts were adjusted to 140 mm KCl and cleared by ultracentrifugation. Whole cell extracts were prepared by snap-freezing and -thawing cell pellets in nuclear extraction buffer and cleared by ultracentrifugation. Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad Protein Assay reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts with end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide called MRE-s, as described previously (7Dalton T.D. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Due to the different protein expression levels in each cell line, different amounts of nuclear protein from each cell line, as indicated in the figure legend, were used to obtain signals within the detection range. Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed using an anti-MTF-1 antibody, or an anti-FLAG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), as described previously (4Smirnova I.V. Bittel D.C. Ravindra R. Jiang H. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9377-9384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Due to the different protein expression levels in each cell line, different amounts of protein from each cell line, as indicated in the figure legend, were used to obtain signals within the detection range. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays were carried out as described previously (32Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13887-13892Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 33Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), with modifications. Cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde, and cross-linking was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. After homogenization of cells as described previously (6Dalton T.P. Li Q.W. Bittel D. Liang L.C. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26233-26241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), the nuclei were lysed in sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 10% SDS, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), and the chromatin was sonicated to an average length of 600–1000 bp and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The chromatin was diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (33Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), pre-cleared with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma), and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) or an anti-USF-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) plus protein A-Sepharose. The beads were washed, the immune complexes eluted, and the cross-links reversed as described previously (33Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The DNA was phenol:chloroform-extracted, reconstituted in TE buffer (pH 8.0), and analyzed by PCR using primers that span –230 to +123 bp (relative to the transcription start site) of the mouse MT-I gene. [32P]dCTP-incorporated PCR products (29 cycles) were separated by electrophoresis in TBE gels, quantified using the Packard Cyclone Storage Phosphor System (Packard Instruments), and normalized to input products. Fold induction was calculated from triplicate PCRs, and for initial experiments, input and immunoprecipitated DNA samples were analyzed at various cycles (28–32 cycles) to ensure that the PCR products were obtained in the linear range of amplification. MTF-1 Is Polymorphic in Mice—During the course of these studies, we discovered that mouse MTF-1 is polymorphic. A mouse MTF-1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AY260849) cloned by RT-PCR from the CD-1 outbred strain of mice showed several differences throughout the protein (Fig. 1) compared with the sequence published in GenBank™ (accession number X71327), resulting in several amino acid substitutions and an amino acid deletion. To determine whether these differences represent polymorphisms, these regions of MTF-1 mRNA were cloned by RT-PCR using total RNA extracted from six individual CD-1 mouse livers, and individual clones were then sequenced. The results confirmed that the differences in the serine/threonine-rich domain and the carboxyl-terminal region of our MTF-1 cDNA clone are present in many individual mice (GenBank™ accession numbers AY260851 and AY260852) and thus represent true polymorphisms. The difference in the amino-terminal region of our MTF-1 cDNA clone was not detected among these RT-PCR products. However, a different change resulting in a different amino acid substitution was found in this region among the clones (GenBank™ accession number AY260850), and a computer search of the GenBank™ EST data base revealed yet another polymorphism in this region (accession number XM124353). Thus, the amino terminus of MTF-1 is highly polymorphic, and the difference we discovered in this region is very likely to represent a true polymorphism. In contrast, we were unable to confirm that the two differences in the zinc finger domain of this MTF-1 cDNA clone represent true polymorphisms. Screening of cDNAs and genomic DNAs from 35 CD-1 mice did not reveal a sequence with those changes. Thus, it cannot be excluded that these differences represent RT-PCR-induced changes in the zinc finger coding region, although the probability of that is very low. Deletion of the Putative Metal-sensing Fingers of MTF-1 Attenuates Its Metalloregulatory Functions on the Endogenous MT-I Gene in Transiently Transfected Cells—Changes found in the zinc finger domain of this MTF-1 cDNA (MTF-1 flag *, Fig. 1) may not represent true polymorphisms. Therefore, an expression vector coding for a FLAG-tagged MTF-1 (MTF-1flag) containing the consensus MTF-1 zinc fingers in a backbone bearing the confirmed polymorphisms in the amino terminus, the serine/threonine-rich domain, and the carboxyl terminus was created and used in the remaining studies (Fig. 1). In initial experiments, expression vectors for MTF-1flag and its finger-deletion mutants (D1flag, D5&6flag, and D6flag, diagrammed in Fig. 1) were transiently transfected into mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from MTF-1 knockout mice (MTFKO), and the ability of the transiently expressed MTF-1flag and its finger-deletion mutants to restore the metal responsiveness of the endogenous MT-I gene was examined. A GFP expression vector was co-transfected to verify consistent transfection efficiency among the vectors (20–25%, data not shown). Total RNA was prepared from the transfected cells before or after treatment with zinc, and MT-I mRNA levels were determined by Northern blotting. Very low levels of MT-I mRNA were detected in MTF-KO cells transfected with the GFP expression vector alone, before and after zinc treatment (Fig. 2, the 0-DNA lanes). In contrast, basal expression of the endogenous MT-I gene was enhanced in cells transiently transfected with the MTF-1flag expression vector. Basal levels of MT-I mRNA in these cells increased as the amount of transfected expression vector increased (Fig. 2A). Expression of MTF-1flag also restored the metal responsiveness of the endogenous MT-I gene. Zinc treatment, as well as cadmium treatment (not shown, see Fig. 3), caused an increase in MT-I mRNA abundance"

We propose that this membrane topology can be extended to all members of the family C GPCRs. Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system and activates ligand-gated ion channels or ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) and G-protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). 1The abbreviations used are: mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptors; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; TM, transmembrane; TEA, triethanolamine. The mGluRs modulate synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability throughout the peripheral and central nervous system. They have been classified into three groups based on sequence homology, pharmacology, and signal transduction coupling. Group I mGluRs, consisting of mGluR1 and mGluR5, uniformly couple to phospholipase C, while group II and III mGluRs, composed of mGluR2, mGluR3, mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, and mGluR8, inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity in heterologous expression systems (1Conn P.J.

Trends Pharmacol Sci. 2001; 22: 114-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Since their cloning, the structure-function relationships of mGluRs have garnered extensive interest. Relatively recent classification of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) has categorized mGluRs as family C GPCRs characterized structurally by a large N-terminal extracellular domain and consisting of mGluRs, GABAB receptors, Ca2+-sensing receptors, and certain pheromone receptors. The large N-terminal extracellular domain of mGluRs exhibits distant homology to bacterial amino acid periplasmic binding proteins, suggesting the domain is responsible for ligand binding (3O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thogersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Structural modeling of mGluRs based on this homology accurately predicts important residues for ligand binding (4Pin J.P. Acher F. Curr. Drug Targets CNS Neurol. Dis. 2002; 1: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Exchange of this domain among mGluRs also endows specific ligand binding properties (5Takahashi K. Tsuchida K. Tanabe Y. Masu M.

Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently, crystal structure determination of the N-terminal domain with bound ligand has definitively confirmed its role in ligand binding and conformational changes of the domain with binding have made several predictions for potential mechanisms for receptor activation (8Kunishima N.

While the structure of the ligand binding N-terminal domain has been clearly resolved, little data exists on the structure and membrane topology of the subsequent transmembrane domains. The complete structure of the canonical GPCR, rhodopsin, has recently been solved and confirms a long line of studies delineating seven membrane spanning α-helices (9Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar, 10Luecke H. Schobert B.

Based on sequence homology, this structure can minimally be extended to other family A GPCRs, such as β-adrenergic receptors, where independent studies also espouse seven transmembrane (7TM) domains (13Dohlman H.G.

Chem. 1989; 264: 14424-14431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the application of the rhodopsin topology to non-homologous GPCRs, such as mGluRs, requires experimental confirmation. For example, some studies have recently suggested that family B bradykinin B2 receptors, may possess five transmembrane domains with two re-entrant loops (15Quitterer U. Zaki E. AbdAlla S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14773-14778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis and chimera studies of mGluRs have delineated specific functional roles for the hydrophilic loops between putative transmembrane domains and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (16Pin J.P. Joly C. Heinemann S.F. Bockaert J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 17Francesconi A. Duvoisin R.M. J. Biol.

Neuron. 1998; 20: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These studies bear implications for topology models. A set of studies has determined that each of the mGluR cytoplasmic regions contributes to G-protein coupling, but only the second intracellular loop determines G-protein specificity (16Pin J.P. Joly C. Heinemann S.F. Bockaert J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the third intracellular loop rather than the second delineates G-protein specificity in other GPCRs. Several potential phosphorylation sites have been determined through mutagenesis studies in the first and second intracellular loops and the C-terminal domain (18Gereau R.W. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1998; 20: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 19Francesconi A. Duvoisin R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6185-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, no direct biochemical evidence of phosphorylation has been obtained at any of these sites. Protease protection of in vitro translated mGluR1 and mGluR interaction sites for cytoplasmic proteins, such as calmodulin and Homer, definitively identify the cytoplasmic location of the C-terminal domain (20Seal A.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27573-27577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Taken together, the structure-function studies of mGluRs to date definitively pinpoint the N-terminal domain as extracellular and the second intracellular loop and C-terminal domain as intracellular, while some data suggest a cytoplasmic location for the first and third intracellular loops. A number of different prediction algorithms are available for use in predicting the transmembrane topology of receptors. The most commonly used of these include classical hydrophobicity mapping and more modern methods that utilize hidden Markov modeling approaches (25Ott C.M. Lingappa V.R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2003-2009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These approaches applied to bovine rhodopsin (accession number AAA30674), predict seven transmembrane domains that coincide with the transmembrane domains identified by crystallographic studies (9Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). However, similar approaches applied to mGluRs yield equivocal results, frequently failing to select the domain identified as putative transmembrane domain 3 when mGluRs are forced to a seven transmembrane domain model (Fig. 1). Thus, while application of a seven transmembrane domain topology to mGluRs makes intuitive sense given that the receptor couples to heterotrimeric G-proteins, a less biased approach to predicting membrane topology clearly indicates that experimental evaluation of this model is needed. In this study, we directly address mGluR topology with truncated fusion constructs of mGluR5a in prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems to probe the capability of individual hydrophobic domains to traverse the membrane. Our data confirm that all seven putative hydrophobic domains span the membrane. Computerized Transmembrane Domain Prediction—The Kyte-Doolittle algorithm was applied to the full rat mGluR5a and bovine rhodopsin sequences using the TopPred web site (bioweb.pasteur.fr/seqanal/interfaces/toppred.html) (26von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). The parameters used were: Full window size: 21; Core window size: 11; Wedge window size: 5; for eukaryotic proteins. Additional analyses were performed using the TMHMM hidden Markov model for predicting transmembrane helices in protein sequences (v2.0; www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0/) (27Sonnhammer E.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1998; 6: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar). The images used for Fig. 1b are taken directly from the output of this web site. Cloning—mGluR5a was cloned into the pCI:Neo expression vector. SalI restriction sites were introduced at amino acid residues 608 (i1), 641 (e1), 688 (i2), 728 (e2), 769 (i3), 799 (e3), and 869 using a modification of the Stratagene QuickChange mutagenesis procedure as previously described (18Gereau R.W. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1998; 20: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These SalI sites were used for insertion of all eptiopes used in this study. In all cases, the amino acid listed is changed to a Val and the following residue is changed to an Asp (the amino acids encoded by the SalI restriction site G/TCGAC). This allowed for in-frame fusion of proteins with a similar SalI or XhoI site introduced in-frame or of paired primers with SalI or XhoI overhangs. FLAG epitopes were inserted using large synthetic primers including the FLAG epitope and SalI and XhoI overhangs. FLAG or HA epitopes were also inserted in place of amino acids 22–27 (just downstream of the signal sequence) by inserting a SalI site at amino acid 22 and an MluI site at amino acid 27, followed by insertion of the FLAG epitope or HA epitope made with large synthetic primers including 5′-SalI and 3′-MluI overhangs. All constructs were verified by direct sequencing. Glycosylation Site Determination—Consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation (NX(S/T)) were mutated by a substitution of the N residues making the following changes: N88G (native glycosylation site 1), N209A (native glycosylation site 2), N377L (native glycosylation site 3), N381A (native glycosylation site 4), N444G (native glycosylation site 5), and N733G (native glycosylation site 6). These mutations were made in combination to generate the ΔNG construct. Mutants in which only individual glycosylation sites remain are denoted NG(no.) (NG5 and NG6), with no. indicating the consensus glycosylation site that has not been mutated, while all others were eliminated as mentioned above. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing the entire open reading frame of the constructs. For analysis of recombinant mGluR5, COS7 cells obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) were cultured in humidified 5% CO2 incubators in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with GlutaMAX supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected with wild-type and glycosylation variants of mGluR5 using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) under optimized conditions. In brief, liposomal/DNA complexes formed at room temperature using a ratio of 1 μg of DNA to 1 μl of liposomes in 100 μl of serum-free OptiMem (Invitrogen Life Technologies) for 20 min were added to cells at 80–90% confluency. For experiments involving inhibition of glycosylation with tunicamycin, following 2 h incubation with liposomal/DNA complexes cell cultures were washed with 10% fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and tunicamycin added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. In all cases cells were harvested in 2% SDS with a cell scraper during the peak protein expression interval, 24–36 h post-transfection. Sample protein concentration was determined using the BioRad DC protein assay. Equal amounts of protein as calculated by protein assay were loaded onto 6% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed at a constant voltage of 20 V through the stacking gel and 200 V through the resolving gel. Electrophoresis was stopped after ∼2.5 h, a runtime determined empirically to yield the optimal resolution for the mobility shift observed between glycosylated and unglycosylated forms of mGluR5. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane support by use of a semidry blotter at a constant current of 200 mA for 2.5 h. After transfer, membranes were blocked in 4% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. Membranes were exposed to rabbit serum raised against a peptide (CSSPKYDTLIIRDYTNSSSSL) corresponding to the mGluR5 C terminus at a 1:2000 dilution in 4% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. Following three 20 min washes in phosphate-buffered saline, membranes were rocked in goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in 4% nonfat dry milk at a 1:5000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Following three 20 min washes in phosphate-buffered saline, immunoreactivity was visualized using ECL chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and exposure to BioMax MR film (Kodak). Optimal exposure time was determined for individual experiments. mGluR5-Lactamase Fusion Construct Ampicillin Resistance—The β-lactamase open reading frame was PCR-amplified without its signal sequence from pBluescript and fused with the various SalI mutants to create fusion constructs terminating at each putative transmembrane domain. These fusion constructs were cloned into a modified pET-28a vector in which the N-terminal His and T7 tags were deleted by digestion with NcoI-BamHI followed by blunting and ligation. The final constructs were transformed into the E. coli strain BL21-DE3-RP (Stratagene) for expression. The cells were grown overnight at 37 °C to saturation in LB + 2% glucose + 30 μg/ml kanamycin + 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. 5 μl of 10-fold serial dilutions were spotted onto LB agar plates with 2% glucose, 30 μg/ml kanamycin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 10 μg/ml ampicillin, and 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C to test for ampicillin resistance. Live Staining of mGluR5a-transfected COS7 Cells—Truncated mGluR5-GFP fusion proteins were created by cloning an EcoRI-SalI fragment from the mGluR5 SalI mutants into the pEGFP-N3 vector (Clontech). In-frame mGluR5a GFP fusions were constructed by cloning a PCR amplified GFP opening reading frame (without the stop codon) with SalI and XhoI overhangs into the mGluR5 SalI mutants. 24 to 48 h post-transfection, media was removed, cells were washed once with 100 mm Hepes pH 7.4 and treated with 100 mm Hepes + 3% BSA for GFP immunostaining or with 100 mm Hepes for FLAG immunostaining for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then cooled to 4 °C and incubated with chicken anti-GFP primary antibody (Chemicon, 1:250) diluted in 100 mm Hepes + 3% BSA or monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma, 1:50) diluted in 100 mm Hepes for 30 min. After five quick rinses with 100 mm Hepes + 3% BSA, cells were incubated with goat anti-chicken or mouse Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Chemicon, 1:1000) for 30 min. Cells were then washed quickly five times with 100 mm Hepes + 3% BSA and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted and visualized using epifluorescence microscopy. Proteolysis of mGluR5a-transfected COS7 Cell Membranes—24–36 h post-transfection, cells plated on 100 mm poly-d-lysine, tissue culture treated plates were washed twice with 10 ml of 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm TEA-acetate pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA-TEA, pH 8. Cells were then scraped into 800 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm TEA-acetate pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA-TEA, pH 8) and allowed to stand on ice for 5–10 min. Cells were homogenized by sending through 23- and 26-gauge needles eight times each. Sucrose was added to a final concentration of 250 mm, and the homogenate was spun at 1020 × g for 10 min to pellet nuclei and debris. The supernatant was placed over a 0.5 m sucrose cushion and spun in a TLA100.2 rotor at 60,000 rpm for 10 min. The membrane pellet was washed with 1 ml of enzyme buffer (120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 20 mm CaCl2) and recentrifuged for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in enzyme buffer and 1–5 μg/ml Asp-N (Roche Applied Science) was added. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 1–2 h at 25 °C. Asp-N digests were stopped by adding 50 mm EDTA-Na, pH 8. An equal volume of 2× sample buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% bromphenol blue) was added to the reactions and an aliquot loaded for SDS-PAGE. This protocol minimized post-solubilization proteolysis as determined by control experiments where reactions were immediately terminated after protease addition. Proteins were separated on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which were then equilibrated in 1× Towbin Buffer + 0.01% SDS. Immobilon-polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Millipore, pore size 0.45 μm) was hydrated in 100% methanol prior to use, and proteins were transferred at a constant voltage of 75 V overnight using a BioRad wet transfer apparatus. Membranes were blocked at room temperature for 1 h in 5% milk in TBST, and then incubated in primary antibody (rat anti-HA, 1:1000, Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then rinsed 4 × 15 min in TBST and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in secondary antibody solution (goat anti-rat conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, 1:10,000 in 5% milk). Membranes were then rinsed 4 × 15 min in TBST prior to visualization of immunoreactive bands using West Pico Supersignal ECL substrate (Pierce) and Kodak BioMax-MR film. N-Glycosylation Site Analysis—N-glycosylation occurs only on extracellular domains of proteins. Therefore, one common method for the determination of membrane topology is the analysis of native and engineered glycosylation sites. An analysis of the mGluR5 protein sequence reveals 6 possible N-glycosylation NX(S/T) consensus sites (28Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3775) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Five of these sites reside on the large N-terminal domain, which is known to be extracellular. One additional site exists in the putative 2nd extracellular loop (e2). We constructed several mutants of mGluR5 in which all but one of the native glycosylation sites was mutated, and analyzed the possible glycosylation of these sites by comparing gel mobility shifts of these proteins compared with wild-type mGluR5 expressed in COS7 cells. A mutant in which all of the native glycosylation sites had been mutated (ΔNG) showed a large mobility shift compared with wild-type mGluR5 (Fig. 2B). These 6 mutations accounted for all of the apparent N-glycosylation, as treatment with tunicamycin, which prevents N-glycosylation, caused no apparent mobility shift in the ΔNG mutant (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, when each of the glycosylation sites was examined individually, only mutation of Asn-444 (native glycosylation site no. 5, or NG5), showed any apparent mobility shift compared with ΔNG, suggesting that Asn-444 accounts for all of the detectable native N-glycosylation in mGluR5. To further test for possible subtle glycosylation of the NG6 site (Asn-733), we transfected cells with the NG6 construct (this construct lacks all glycosylation consensus sites except the Asn-733 NG6 site) and grew these cultures in the absence or presence of tunicamycin. We could not detect any mobility shift in response to inhibiting glycosylation for the NG6 construct, although tunicamycin caused a pronounced mobility shift for the Asn-444 NG5 construct (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results suggest that Asn-444, but not Asn-733 in mGluR5a is glycosylated in COS7 cells. Similar results were obtained when these constructs were expressed in HEK293T cells (data not shown). To test whether the hydrophilic loops between the predicted transmembrane domains were in the predicted orientation, a number of ectopic n-glycosylation consensus sequences (NX(S/T)) were introduced into the ΔNG construct by mutagenesis. These included the introduction of two consensus sites simultaneously in i1, two simultaneously in e1, one individually in e2, and 3 simultaneously in the proximal region of the C-terminal tail (for positions see Fig. 7). None of the ectopic glycosylation consensus mutants resulted in any detectable mobility shift compared with the ΔNG mutant, and no shifts in the ectopic glycosylation mutants could be detected when comparing the constructs in the absence and presence of tunicamycin, suggesting that these sites are not significantly glycosylated (data not shown). Since not all extracellularly located glycosylation consensus sequences are glycosylated, the absence of glycosylation is not completely surprising and does not contribute to determining membrane topology. Nonetheless, these experiments clearly identify Asn-444 as the major N-linked glycosylation site in mGluR5a. Analysis of mGluR5a-Lactamase Fusion Proteins in Escherichia coli—The membrane topology of several prokaryotic and eukaryotic membrane proteins has been studied in bacteria typically using fusions to alkaline phosphatase or β-galactosidase. More importantly, the topology of canonical β-adrenergic and the V2 vasopressin GPCRs has been determined in E. coli using similar approaches (29Lacatena R.M. Cellini A. Scavizzi F. Tocchini-Valentini G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10521-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 30Schulein R. Rutz C. Rosenthal W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28844-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, studying mGluR topology in bacteria allows a direct comparison to established 7TM GPCRs. We fused a series of truncated mGluR5a proteins to β-lactamase, which allows for simple determination of lactamase activity and export by testing for ampicillin resistance. At high cell densities, bacteria bearing any form of lactamase, regardless of export, can grow through the provision of lactamase activity from neighboring lysed bacteria. However, at low cell densities, only bacteria with lactamase exported to the periplasmic space can survive by degrading ampicillin before it reaches the cell wall synthesis apparatus. Thus, bacteria transformed with mGluR5a-lactamase fusion constructs where the lactamase moiety has been exported to the periplasm grow at most dilutions, while those where functional lactamase protein remains in the cytoplasm only grow at higher cell densities. Bacteria with non-functional lactamase, such as empty pET28a vector or constructs with lactamase “sandwiched” in-frame within mGluR5, do not grow at all (data not shown). Using this system, it appears that constructs after i2 behave as predicted by the 7TM model. However, constructs before i2 appear inverted with i1 being exported to the periplasm and e1 remaining cytoplasmic (Fig. 2). While this may suggest an unexpected topology, an alternative hypothesis is that the N-terminal domain fails to be exported without TM3 and/or i2. A similar phenomenon occurs with β-adrenergic receptors (29Lacatena R.M. Cellini A. Scavizzi F. Tocchini-Valentini G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10521-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, TM1 and TM2 appropriately traverse the membrane, but the N-terminal domain remains cytoplasmic. In support of this notion, the mGluR5 N-terminal domain (without any transmembrane domains) fusion fails to export lactamase (Fig. 3). Analysis of mGluR5a Fusion Proteins in Mammalian Cells— While the prokaryotic studies found that the topology and folding behavior of mGluR5a mimicked 7TM β-adrenergic receptors, we wanted to verify these findings in mammalian cells. We created similar mGluR5a fusion proteins with EGFP and expressed them in COS7 cells. Live immunostaining of these cells with anti-GFP antibody was used to determine whether EGFP was translocated extracellularly in these constructs. However, absent immunoreactivity may be due either to a cytoplasmic EGFP or an extracellular EGFP that fails to reach the surface membrane. To confirm surface expression, we also conducted immunostaining against an N-terminal FLAG (DYKDDDK) tag. Several constructs targeted to the surface appropriately and confirmed the locations of i1, e1, e2, and the C-terminal domains as predicted by the 7TM topology model (Fig. 4, B and C). Some of these fusion constructs did not reach the surface and thus no conclusions could be made regarding i2, i3, and e3 (Fig. 4, B and C). All constructs exhibited positive staining for anti-FLAG and anti-GFP after membrane permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X (data not shown). We attempted to achieve surface expression by creating “sandwich” constructs where EGFP was inserted in-frame at each hydrophilic loop of full-length mGluR5a. Several membrane topology studies have utilized this approach of inserting “reporter” epitopes. Surprisingly, only the construct with EGFP inserted at i2 surface expressed and the absence of anti-EGFP immunoreactivity confirmed its cytoplasmic location (Fig. 4D; non-surface-expressing construct data not shown). Similar results were also obtained with FLAG and HA tag insertions (data not shown). Taken together, the live immunostaining of EGFP- and FLAG-tagged mGluR5 shown in Fig. 4 have confirmed the cytoplasmic localization of the i1 and i2 loops as well as the C-terminal tail. Further, these results confirm the extracellular localization of e1 and e2 loops. The lack of surface expression of all constructs tested with fusions in the i3 and e3 loops made it apparent that a successful strategy to conclusively study mGluR5 fusion protein topology must be independent of targeting and surface expression. To do this, we conducted Asp-N protection assays of truncated mGluR5a fusion proteins, where the C-terminal domain of mGluR5a itself (amino acids 869-stop) was fused at various points along mGluR5. This approach utilizes the parent construct shown in Fig. 5B, which bears a HA epitope tag inserted immediately after the signal peptide at amino acid 22 (mGluR5-HA). This extracellular epitope (at the identical site to the FLAG tag used in Fig. 4) is used in Western blots following Asp-N protease treatment of vesicles prepared from COS7 cells expressing mGluR5-HA and various mutants. Vesicles are treated with Asp-N, which will cleave the protein at accessible Asp (D) residues. Vesicle preparations result in vesicles of bo"

Various aspects of the biology of Plasmodium falciparum subtilisin-like protease-1 (PfSUB-1), including the timing of its expression and its apical location in the merozoite, suggest that this enzyme is involved in invasion. Recombinant PfSUB-1 expressed in a baculovirus system is secreted in the p54 form, noncovalently bound to its cognate propeptide, p31. To understand the role of p31 in PfSUB-1 maturation, we examined interactions between p31 and both recombinant and native enzymes. CD analyses revealed that recombinant p31 (rp31) possesses significant secondary structure on its own, comparable with that of folded propeptides of some bacterial subtilisins. Kinetic studies demonstrated that rp31 is a fast binding, high affinity inhibitor of PfSUB-1. Inhibition of two bacterial subtilisins by rp31 was much less effective, with inhibition constants 49–60-fold higher than that for PfSUB-1. Single (at the P4 or P1 position) or double (at P4 and P1 positions) point mutations of residues within the C-terminal region of rp31 had little effect on its inhibitory activity, and truncation of 11 residues from the rp31 C terminus substantially reduced, but did not abolish, inhibition. None of these modifications prevented binding to the PfSUB-1 catalytic domain or rendered the propeptide susceptible to proteolytic digestion by PfSUB-1. These studies provide new insights into the function of the propeptide in PfSUB-1 activation and shed light on the structural requirements for interaction with the catalytic domain.

Parasites of the genus Plasmodium are responsible for the debilitating disease malaria, which affects 300–500 million people each year, mostly in subtropical regions (1World Health OrganizationReport on Infectious Diseases. World Health Organization, Geneva1999Google Scholar). The continued emergence of drug-resistant parasites imposes an urgent need for a new generation of control measures. The life cycle of the malaria parasite in the human is complex, involving intracellular replication in both hepatocytes and erythrocytes, with the pathophysiological manifestations closely allied to intraerythrocytic replication. Plasmodium merozoites actively penetrate erythrocytes via a tightly regulated series of events involving proteolytic processing and release of proteins from the apical organelles and surface of the parasite (2Blackman M.J.

Functional maturation of many invasion-related proteins requires their proteolytic modification and, in some cases, their eventual removal from the parasite surface. These processing events can occur both in the apical organelles and at the parasite surface (4Howell S.A. Withers-Martinez C. Kocken C.H. Thomas A.W. Blackman M.J. J. Biol.

PfSUB-1 is expressed in the latter stages of schizogony, is located in a subset of dense granules at the apical end of the merozoite, and is secreted during erythrocyte invasion (8Blackman M.J.

Sequence comparisons and homology modeling have shown that PfSUB-1 is structurally most closely related to the bacterial subtilisins; unlike most bacterial subtilisins, however, PfSUB-1 has a highly restricted substrate specificity, suggesting a highly specialized, non-degradative physiological role in the parasite (11Sajid M.

A better understanding of the function, enzymology, and specificity of PfSUB-1, along with the characterization of endogenous inhibitors, may facilitate the development of specific inhibitors as a novel antimalarial therapy. Subtilases are synthesized as zymogens, which consist minimally of a signal peptide, a propeptide domain, and a catalytic domain. The propeptide functions as an intramolecular chaperone, being essential for correct folding of the catalytic domain and for enzyme maturation (13Shinde U. Inouye M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 379: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Folding is generally rapidly followed by autoproteolytic cleavage at the junction between the propeptide and mature domain. The cleaved propeptide often remains transiently associated with the catalytic domain in a noncovalent complex. In many cases, subtilase propeptides are potent inhibitors of their cognate catalytic domains, with inhibition constants in the nanomolar range (14Li Y. Hu Z. Jordan F. Inouye M. J. Biol.

PfSUB-1 maturation during secretory transport in the parasite involves two sequential autocatalytic processing events that convert the precursor first to a p54 form by cleavage of the propeptide and subsequently to a p47 form by further cleavage within the N-terminal segment of p54 (11Sajid M. Withers-Martinez C. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 631-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when produced in a baculovirus expression system, recombinant PfSUB-1 (rPfSUB-1) is mostly secreted in the p54 form, a substantial fraction of which is noncovalently linked to its cognate propeptide, p31 (11Sajid M. Withers-Martinez C. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 631-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Withers-Martinez C. Saldanha J.W. Ely B. Hackett F.

To better understand the activation of PfSUB-1, we have examined the role of the propeptide and explored the possibility that it can act as a specific inhibitor. After recombinant expression and characterization of the propeptide, we have investigated its structure, its interactions with both baculovirus-derived and native enzymes, and the specificity and stability of these interactions. Analyses of various mutants of the propeptide have indicated the regions and residues that determine its interactions with the catalytic domain. Construction of an Escherichia coli PfSUB-1 Propeptide Expression System—DNA encoding the propeptide of PfSUB-1 (Lys26–Asp219 of the 690-residue-long primary sequence) (8Blackman M.J. Fujioka H.

The recombinant propeptide was called rp31. A truncated version of rp31 (called rp31Δ11) lacking 11 residues at the C terminus was also generated by PCR using the F1 forward oligonucleotide and the reverse oligonucleotide 5′-AGAGGAGAGTTAGAGCCTTAAGCACCCTTCTCTTCCAAGATC-3′. The nucleotide sequences of the cloned products were confirmed on both strands by sequencing on an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems Model 377). Site-directed Mutagenesis—The desired mutations within the PfSUB-1 propeptide were introduced by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis using the F1 forward primer in combination with the reverse primers indicated below. Three different rp31 mutants (called rp31-VSAL, rp31-ASAD and rp31-ASAL) were generated. In the rp31-VSAL mutant, the C-terminal residue Asp219 was mutated to Leu by replacement of the terminal CTA codon with CTT using the reverse oligonucleotide 5′-AGAGGAGAGTTAGAGCCTTAAAGAGCGGACACCAACTTGTC-3′ (the mismatched codon is underlined). In the rp31-ASAD mutant, Val216 was similarly mutated to Ala using the reverse oligonucleotide 5′-AGAGGAGAGTTAGAGCCTTAATCAGCGGAAGCCAACTTGTCAGAC-3′. For the rp31-ASAL double mutant, Asp219 was mutated to Leu and Val216 was replaced with Ala using the reverse oligonucleotide5′-AGAGGAGAGTTAGAGCCTTAAAGAGCGGAAGCCAACTTGTCAGAC-3′. DNA fragments encoding the mutants were cloned into pET-30Xa/LIC, and the mutations were verified on both strands by sequencing as described above. Protein Expression and Purification and Antiserum Production— rp31 and mutant rp31 sequences were expressed in E. coli BL21-Gold (DE3) pLysS (Stratagene). One liter of LB medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin was inoculated with 4 ml of fresh overnight culture and grown at 37 °C to A 600 = 0.5 prior to induction with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 4 h of induction, the cells were pelleted, resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mm NaCl, and lysed by sonication, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 100 μm leupeptin, and 0.3 μm aprotinin and clarified by passage through a 0.22-μm filter. Purification of all of the recombinant propeptide constructs to homogeneity was by the same three-step procedure. To the ∼50-ml supernatant was added 40 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (QIAGEN Inc.). The gel suspension was mixed on ice for 30 min, transferred to a sintered glass funnel, washed with 5 gel volumes of 2 mm imidazole in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mm NaCl, and eluted with 2 gel volumes of 150 mm imidazole in the same buffer. Eluted proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration at 4 °C with a YM-10 membrane (Amicon, Inc.) and then chromatographed on a Superdex 200 26/60 prep-grade column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2) containing 150 mm NaCl. The propeptide peak was detected by SDS-PAGE (19Laemmli J.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. Pooled peak fractions were loaded onto a 1-ml RESOURCE Q column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2) and 150 mm NaCl. The column was washed with the same buffer and then eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (150–600 mm) in the same buffer. The propeptide peak was pooled and stored in aliquots at –70 °C. Electrospray mass spectrometric analysis of the purified protein was performed as described previously (11Sajid M. Withers-Martinez C. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 631-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A mouse polyclonal antiserum was raised against the purified protein using standard procedures. Expression of baculovirus-derived rPfSUB-1 in insect cells and protease purification were as described previously (12Withers-Martinez C. Saldanha J.W. Ely B. Hackett F. O'Connor T. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29698-29709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the His 6 and S Tags from rp31—The N-terminal fusion peptide containing the His6 and S tags was removed from rp31 using Factor Xa (Roche Applied Science). A solution of purified rp31 was adjusted to 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2; Factor Xa was added to obtain a protease/substrate ratio of 1:56 (w/w); and digestion was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 4 h. Protease activity was stopped by the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. An equal volume of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was added to the digest, and unbound material containing cleaved rp31 (rp31ΔSH) was recovered, supplemented with 10 mm EGTA, and purified by gel filtration as described above. The rp31ΔSH peak was concentrated by ultrafiltration at 4 °C using a YM-3 membrane (Amicon, Inc.) and stored at –70 °C. Determination of Protein Purity and Concentration—The amino acid composition and concentration of purified rp31 were determined in duplicate amino acid analyses by Dr. Peter Sharratt (Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Facility, Cambridge University, Cambridge, UK). The concentrations of the various purified rp31 mutants were then determined by a comparative reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method. Samples of purified rp31 and its mutant forms were chromatographed on a Vydac C18 RP-HPLC column (4.6 mm × 25 cm) and eluted with a 9–27% (v/v) gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, with absorbance monitored at 215 nm. Each recombinant protein eluted as a single peak under these conditions. The concentration of each mutant was extrapolated by comparing its peak height upon RP-HPLC with the peak height of a known amount of rp31. CD Measurements—CD spectra of rp31 and rp31ΔSH were recorded from 260 to 195 nm (or from 260 to 210 nm in the presence of urea) at 20 °C in a fused silica cuvette of 1-mm path length using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. Protein concentrations were ∼0.1 mg/ml, and the buffer was 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2) and 67.5 mm NaCl with or without 5 m urea (for rp31) or 16.6 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2) and 125 mm NaCl (for rp31ΔSH). The spectra are the averages of multiple scans recorded using a scan speed of 200 nm/min and a response time of 0.25 s. Appropriate buffer blanks were subtracted from all spectra. For deconvolution, spectra were subjected to multicomponent secondary structure analysis using the SELCON3 algorithm (20Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2445) Google Scholar). PfSUB-1 Enzyme Activity and Inhibition Assays—Kinetic experiments assessing the effect of recombinant propeptide constructs on the activity of baculovirus-derived rPfSUB-1 were as described previously, based on the cleavage of the tetramethylrhodamine-labeled fluorogenic peptide substrate pepF1-6R (12Withers-Martinez C. Saldanha J.W. Ely B. Hackett F. O'Connor T. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29698-29709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Blackman M.J. Corrie J.E.T. Croney J.C. Kelly G. Eccleston J.F. Jameson D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12244-12252Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, 90 μl of pepF1-6R (2 μm final concentration) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 12 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 was added to a 3 × 3-mm path length cell. The solution was allowed to stabilize to 37 °C in the spectrofluorometer for 2 min before the addition of 10 μl of purified rPfSUB-1 (74 nm final concentration). Increase in fluorescence, reflecting cleavage of pepF1-6R, was measured over the ensuing 4 min. To determine the inhibitory activity of the recombinant propeptides, 1 μl of different concentrations of the recombinant propeptides or 2 μl of an inhibitor control (3,4-dichloroisocoumarin at 80 μm final concentration) was added directly to the reaction with rapid mixing, and the hydrolysis rate was measured for an additional 5 min. All experiments were performed in triplicate and used concentrations of pepF1-6R well below its K m, under which conditions, K i(app) ∼ K i (22Nicklin M.J.H. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the absence of inhibitors, the rate of hydrolysis over this period was linear, and ∼10% of the total substrate was hydrolyzed. Following each assay, the cell was thoroughly cleaned by treatment with chromic acid. P. falciparum schizont extracts containing endogenous PfSUB-1 were prepared by successive solubilizations with Triton X-100 and CHAPS as described previously (11Sajid M. Withers-Martinez C. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 631-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Withers-Martinez C. Saldanha J.W. Ely B. Hackett F. O'Connor T. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29698-29709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To determine inhibition of native PfSUB-1 by rp31, the schizont extract was incubated with an unlabeled synthetic peptide substrate called PEP1 (2 mm final concentration) in the absence or presence of purified rp31 (84 nm final concentration) for 4 h at 37 °C, and then cleavage of PEP1 was assessed by RP-HPLC as described previously (12Withers-Martinez C. Saldanha J.W. Ely B. Hackett F. O'Connor T. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29698-29709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Selectivity of Inhibition by rp31—The selectivity of rp31 as a subtilase inhibitor was assessed by measuring its capacity to inhibit the activity of subtilisin BPN′ (Sigma P-4789) or subtilisin Carlsberg (Sigma P-5380). The assay was based on the hydrolysis of N-succinyl-l-Ala-l-Ala-l-Pro-l-Phe-p-nitroanilide (Suc-AAPF-pNA) by these proteases, essentially as described by DelMar et al. (23DelMar E.G. Largman C. Brodrick J.W. Geokas M.C. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 12 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 at room temperature. Kinetic measurements were performed using a Unicam UV1 spectrofluorometer, measuring absorbance at 412 nm. For K m determination, concentrations of Suc-AAPF-pNA between 60 μm and1mm were used to determine initial hydrolysis rates, which were plotted against substrate concentration, fitting the data to the hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten rate equation by nonlinear regression using the program GraFit 5 (Version 5.0.4, Erithacus Software Ltd., Horley, UK) (24Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit Version 5. Erithacus Software Ltd., Horley, United Kindgom2001Google Scholar). For inhibition assays, 500 μl of the substrate at 60 μm in a 10-mm path length cell was supplemented with 2.5 μl of subtilisin BPN′ or subtilisin Carlsberg (25 nm final concentration). Increase in absorbance was measured over the ensuing 15 min to obtain an initial hydrolysis rate, before direct addition to the mixture of various concentrations of purified rp31 (16.8, 42, 84, and 168 nm final concentrations) or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm final concentration) as an inhibitor control. The subsequent hydrolysis rate was measured for an additional 10 min. Note that, in the absence of inhibitors, the rate of hydrolysis was linear over the entire period of measurement, and no more than 10% of the total available substrate was hydrolyzed. Stability of rp31 and rp31 Mutants—The stability of rp31 and its various mutants to digestion by rPfSUB-1 in the presence of the substrate pepF1-6R was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To 90 μl of 2 μm pepF1-6R in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 12 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 were added 10 μl of purified rPfSUB-1 (61.5 nm final concentration) and 1 μl of recombinant propeptide at various concentrations. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C. At intervals, aliquots were removed, and protease activity was terminated by boiling in Laemmli dissociation buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. All samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto Hy-bond-C membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked by incubation in 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with mouse anti-rp31 antiserum, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. Antigen-antibody interactions were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate, Pierce). Binding of rPfSUB-1 to rp31 and rp31 Mutants—Recombinant propeptide constructs, along with molecular mass marker proteins (Amersham Biosciences) as controls for nonspecific binding of PfSUB-1, were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were either stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 or transferred to Hybond-C membrane. The membranes were blocked by incubation in 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in PBS and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing purified rPfSUB-1 (∼3 nm final concentration) before washing and probing with a rabbit antiserum specific for the catalytic domain of PfSUB-1 (8Blackman M.J. Fujioka H. Stafford W.H.L. Sajid M. Clough B. Fleck S.L. Aikawa M. Grainger M. Hackett F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23398-23409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Antigen-antibody interactions were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Recombinant Expression and Characterization of the PfSUB-1 Propeptide (rp31)—Plasmid pET-30Xa/LIC carrying the p31 sequence (Fig. 1A) was transformed into E. coli strain BL21-Gold (DE3) pLysS, and protein expression was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The recombinant product (rp31) is predicted to comprise Lys26–Asp219 of the PfSUB-1 sequence precisely fused to a 46-residue-long N-terminal extension derived from the expression plasmid and containing a His6 tag and an S tag, followed by a Factor Xa cleavage site. The expressed protein was mostly soluble (data not shown) and was purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1B) using a three-step procedure consisting of chelating nickel, gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatography. The purified product migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel as a single species (Fig. 1B). Electrospray mass spectrometry revealed a molecular mass for the pure product of 26,929 ± 2.90 Da, which is in good agreement with its predicted mass of 26,928.63 Da. Amino acid analysis confirmed its identity and purity and also allowed determination of the precise concentration of a large batch of purified rp31, which was 8.4 μm (data not shown). Note that rp31 contains no tryptophan residues and only a single tyrosine residue. Based on the algorithm of Pace et al. (26Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar), its predicted molar absorption coefficient at 280 nm in water (ϵ280 nm) is therefore only 1490 m– cm–1. Using the purified material and assuming 100% purity, the experimentally determined ϵ280 nm was found to be 6785 m1–1 cm–1. A sample of purified rp31 was treated with Factor Xa to remove the N-terminal His6 and S tags, and the resulting protein (called rp31ΔSH) was analyzed by CD under nondenaturing conditions in parallel with intact rp31 (Fig. 1C). The secondary structure of rp31ΔSH measured from the CD spectrum was calculated to be 33.4% unordered. The spectrum also displayed some negative ellipticity at 208 and 222 nm, indicating the presence of secondary structure that, upon deconvolution, could be attributed to 19.5% α-helix and 26.3% β-sheet (Fig. 1C). It is worth noting that, as mentioned above, the PfSUB-1 propeptide sequence is not rich in aromatic residues, side chains of which can contribute to the CD spectrum and provide potentially misleading data (25Sreerama N. Manning M.C. Powers M.E. Zhang J.X. Goldenberg D.P. Woody R.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10814-10822Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the recombinant propeptide adopts significant secondary structure in isolation, without the presence of the cognate PfSUB-1 catalytic domain. Under similar conditions, the CD spectrum of intact rp31 revealed an only slightly lower degree of secondary structure, consisting of 13.8% α-helix and 21.9% β-sheet. Importantly, this could be removed by denaturation with 5 m urea (Fig. 1C). Our data indicate that the N-terminal sequence comprising the His6 and S tags does not contribute to the secondary structure of the protein and, more importantly, does not prevent folding of its propeptide component. This result validated the use of rp31 for the additional studies described below.

To establish whether gluconeogenesis is indeed inhibited by Fru-2,6-P2 in intact animals, a novel NMR method was developed using [U-13C]glucose and 2H2O as tracers. The method was used to estimate the sources of plasma glucose from gastric absorption of oral [U-13C]glucose, from gluconeogenesis, and from glycogen in 24-h fasted rats. Liver Fru-2,6-P2 increased ∼10-fold shortly after the glucose load, reached a maximum at 60 min, and then dropped to base-line levels by 150 min. The gastric contribution to plasma glucose reached ∼50% at 30 min after the glucose load and gradually decreased thereafter. Although the contribution of glycogen to plasma glucose was small, glucose formed from gluconeogenesis was substantial throughout the study period even when liver Fru-2,6-P2 was high. Liver glycogen repletion was also brisk throughout the study period, reaching ∼30 μmol/g at 3 h. These data demonstrate that Fru-2,6-P2 does not inhibit gluconeogenesis significantly in vivo.

Plasma glucose is preserved by gluconeogenesis after exhaustion of glycogen stores during a moderate fast. Following an oral glucose load, gluconeogenesis is thought to be modulated by allosteric regulation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (1Ruderman N.B. Aoki T.T. Cahill G.F. Hanson R.W. Mehlman M.A. Gluconeogenesis: Its Regulation in Mammalian Species. John Wiley and Sons, New York1976: 515-532Google Scholar). This is an eminently satisfying model because a key regulatory site in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis occurs at level of fructose-6-P and fructose-1,6-P2 (Fig. 1). Phosphofructokinase-1, the glycolytic enzyme, is potently activated by fructose-2,6-P2, whereas fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, the gluconeogenic enzyme, is thought to be inhibited by this same effector molecule (2Pilkis S.J.

Thus, by regulating the activities of phosphofructo-1-kinase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase in a reciprocal manner, Fru-2,6-P2 is thought to serve as an elegant regulator of glucose usage/production by the liver after an oral glucose load. This generally accepted model is based on kinetic analysis of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase in vitro, which shows that Fru-2,6-P2 competes with Fru-1,6-P2 for the active site of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and that both molecules have similar affinity constants, 1–5 μm (4Pilkis S.J.

However, the in vivo concentrations of Fru-1,6-P2 in fasted and fed livers are 20 and 35 μm, respectively, whereas those of Fru-2,6-P2 are 1 and 8 μm, respectively (7Thomas H. Uyeda K. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 8Kuwajima M. Uyeda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Lawson J.W.R. Guynn R.W. Cornell N. Veech R.L. Hanson R.W. Mehlman M.A. Gluconeogenesis: Its Regulation in Mammalian Species. John Wiley and Sons, New York1976Google Scholar). This suggests that it would be difficult for Fru-2,6-P2 to have a significant direct effect on fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity in vivo based simply upon concentration differences. Some evidence has been presented that suggests Fru-2,6-P2 is not a potent inhibitor of gluconeogenesis in intact animals. For example, Kuwajima et al. (10Kuwajima M. Golden S. Katz J. Unger R.H. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2632-2637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported continual production of liver glycogen in sucrose-fed rats despite high levels of Fru-2,6-P2, and Hue and Bartrons (11Hue L. Bartrons R. Biochem. J. 1984; 218: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) observed stimulated glucose production by glucagon in isolated hepatocytes regardless of the levels of Fru-2,6-P2. Levels of Fru-2,6-P2 have also been manipulated by recombinant adenovirus overexpression of the bifunctional enzyme phosphofructo-2-kinase:fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (the enzyme that catalyzes both synthesis and degradation of Fru-2,6-P2) in mice and rats in vivo (12Wu C.

Here, increased hepatic Fru-2,6-P2 in vivo actually resulted in increased glycogen synthesis from [1-13C]glucose via the indirect pathway (14Choi I.Y. Wu C. Okar D.A. Lange A.J. Gruetter R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4418-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), thereby suggesting that activation of glycolysis by Fru-2,6-P2 is more important than inhibition of glyconeogenesis in vivo. The relationship between glucose production by liver and hepatic [Fru-2,6-P2] after an oral glucose load typical of that used in a tolerance test (OGTT) 1The abbreviations used are: OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test; J-HSQC, J-resolved heteronuclear single quantum coherence; MAG, monoacetone glucose.1The abbreviations used are: OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test; J-HSQC, J-resolved heteronuclear single quantum coherence; MAG, monoacetone glucose. is even less well defined. It has also been shown that hepatic glucose output in 24–30-h fasted rats is not suppressed after an oral glucose load (15Smadja C. Morin J. Ferre P. Girard J. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 16Niewoehner C.B. Gilboe D.P. Nuttall F.Q. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: E89-E94PubMed Google Scholar), but [Fru-2,6-P2] was not measured. Continual production of glucose by the liver may play a role in diabetes, and so a simple method to detect persistent gluconeogenesis after an oral glucose load or after administration of a hypoglycemic agent may assist in therapy of this epidemic disease (17Staehr P. Hother-Nielsen O. Beck-Nielsen H. Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2002; 4: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Numerous methods to monitor sources of plasma glucose have been described. Classical metabolite balance studies across the liver or across the entire splanchnic circulation are not optimal because measuring hepatic glucose production requires access to the portal vein, and analysis of splanchnic glucose balance is limited by uncertainties about glucose uptake in the gut. Detection of hepatic glycogen by 13C NMR offers direct, noninvasive, and serial measurements of hepatic glycogen mobilization, but the method is not widely available and is difficult to apply to small animals without prelabeling of hepatic glycogen. Sophisticated isotope tracer studies rely on incorporation of 13C gluconeogenic precursors into plasma glucose, incorporation of deuterium or tritium from body water into specific sites in plasma glucose, or the redistribution of 13C label within plasma glucose molecules (18Katz J. Wals P. Lee W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25509-25521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These methods assume metabolic steady state and require metabolic models of variable sophistication. The present study had two purposes: 1) to distinguish the sources of plasma glucose (gastric absorption, gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis) in fasted rats during an oral glucose load using a simple combination of 13C and 2H tracers; and 2) to determine whether hepatic Fru-2,6-P2, elevated after an oral glucose load, alters the contribution of gluconeogenesis to plasma glucose. Here, a combination of 1H and J-resolved heteronuclear single quantum coherence (J-HSQC) spectroscopy was used to evaluate the contributions of hepatic versus gastric glucose over time following an oral glucose load, whereas 2H enrichments at the H5 versus H2 positions of plasma glucose as determined by 2H NMR gave a direct measure of the glycogenolysis versus gluconeogenesis contributions to plasma glucose. The data show that gluconeogenesis is not inhibited significantly in vivo following a glucose load in 24-h starved rats and that gluconeogenesis remains active even when Fru-2,6-P2 is elevated 10-fold. Protocol—The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 100–140 g (120 ± 9 g) were fasted for 24 h with free access to water. To initiate the study (t = 0), a bolus of glucose (2 g/kg; enriched with [U-13C]glucose to 5 or 10%) was administered by oral gavage, and 2 ml of 2H2O (99.9%; Cambridge Isotopes, Andover, MA) was injected into the intraperitoneal cavity. This was done without anesthesia. At 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, or 180 min, the animals were anesthetized by ether inhalation, a small portion of liver (0.2–0.3 g) was immediately freeze-clamped, and as much blood as possible (∼2–3 ml) was collected from the descending aorta into a heparinized syringe. Following exsanguination, the remaining liver tissue was also quickly freeze-clamped. Assays for hepatic metabolites were performed on the first small section of liver, whereas the larger freeze-clamped portion was used to isolate liver glycogen. The blood was centrifuged and the plasma divided into 3 aliquots; 10 μl was used to assay for glucose, 10 μl for a 2H2O enrichment measurement, and the remaining plasma for isolation of glucose for NMR spectroscopy. A separate group of animals was studied to determine the 2H enrichment pattern in blood glucose in the absence of a glucose load; these rats received only 2 ml of 2H2O and were sacrificed at 50 min. Analytical Procedures—Whole blood was immediately centrifuged, and the plasma was separated and deproteinized with perchloric acid (70%), neutralized with KOH solution, and lyophilized. Plasma glucose was converted to monoacetone glucose (MAG) using the method of Landau et al. (19Landau B.R. Wahren J. Chandramouli V. Schumann W.C. Ekberg K. Kalhan S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The lyophilized extract was suspended in 1.0 ml of acetone containing 40 μl of concentrated sulfuric acid and stirred at room temperature for 5 h. The pH of the mixture was adjusted with 50% NaOH until it became mildly basic. The acetone supernatant was transferred into another tube, and the remaining precipitate was washed three times using 1-ml aliquots of acetone. The supernatant and washings were combined and evaporated under a stream of dry nitrogen gas. The resulting dried residue was suspended in 5 ml of water, adjusted to pH 2.0 with dilute HCl, and incubated at 40 °C for 5 h. Thereafter, the solution was adjusted to pH 8.0 with NaOH and lyophilized. Glycogen was extracted from the liver and purified as described previously (20Moriwaki T. Landau B.R. Endocrinology. 1963; 72: 134-145Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Isolated glycogen was dissolved in 5 ml of 10 mm sodium acetate solution (pH 5) and hydrolyzed by incubating for 4 h at 50 °C with 20 units of amyloglucosidase (Sigma). After freeze-drying, the glucose was converted to MAG as described above. NMR Spectroscopy—MAG derived from plasma glucose was dissolved into 180 μl of 90% acetonitrile, 10% deuterium-depleted water (Cambridge Isotopes) along with a few grains of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). 2H NMR spectra were collected at 50 °C using a Varian INOVA 14.1 T spectrometer (Varian Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with 3-mm broadband probe tuned to 2H (92.1 MHz). Shimming was performed by visual inspection of select 1H resonances of MAG using the decoupler coil for detection. Proton-decoupled 2H NMR spectra were acquired using a 90° pulse and a sweep width of 920 Hz and 1984 digitized points. Typical 2H spectra required the sum of 5,000–20,000 scans. Proton decoupling was performed using a standard WALTZ-16 pulse sequence. 1H NMR and J-HSQC spectra were obtained on MAG dissolved in 120 μl of acetonitrile (natural abundance), 20 μl of deionized water, and 40 μl of deuterated acetonitrile to provide a 2H lock. All 1H and J-HSQC spectra were collected using a 3-mm inverse probe (Nalorac, Inc. Martinez, CA) on the same spectrometer. 1H NMR spectra were acquired using a 90° pulse and a 1-s interpulse delay, averaged over 64 scans (the acetonitrile signal was presaturated using a frequency selective pulse). The J-HSQC sequence using REBURP-shaped refocusing pulses was described previously (21Burgess S.C. Carvalho R.A. Merritt M.E. Jones J.G. Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The 180° null method was used to determine the 1H90° pulse width, and the null of the acetonitrile 13C satellites was used to determine the 13C 90° pulse width. A spectral width of 4000 Hz digitized into 2394 points was used for the 1H dimension (F2), whereas 64 increments covering a spectral width of 120 Hz were used for the 13C dimension (F1). 13C NMR spectra of hepatic glutamate (purified from liver extracts) were obtained in 2H2O using a Varian INOVA 11.75 T spectrometer (Varian Instruments) equipped with a 5-mm broadband probe. Proton-decoupled spectra were acquired over 28,000 Hz (sweep width) digitized into 16,000 points using a 45° pulse and a 4-s interpulse delay. Spectra were typically averaged over 10,000 to 40,000 scans. 2H Enrichment in Plasma Water—The 2H enrichment of plasma water was determined as described previously (22Jones J.G. Merritt M.E. Malloy C.R. Magn. Reson. Med. 2001; 45: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Proton-decoupled 2H NMR spectra (128 scans) were acquired using a 30° pulse and a sweep width of 920 Hz digitized into 3776 points. An interpulse delay of 8 s was used to avoid partial saturation effects. 2H spectra were collected on acetone samples (990 μl) containing 10 μl of plasma. The percent 2H in plasma water was determined by comparing the areas of the H2O/acetone resonances with resonance areas measured in a series of standards. Standards were prepared with 2H enrichments ranging from 0 to 2.5% using 2H2O (99.9%) and natural abundance water. Analysis of Spectra—The 2H resonance intensities in spectra of MAG were determined by Bayesian analysis (Varian Instruments) of the raw time domain data. Peak areas in all other NMR spectra were measured after Fourier transformation by using the line-fitting subroutine in the PC-based NMR spectral analysis program, NUTS™ (Acorn NMR Inc., Freemont, CA). Plasma Glucose Originating from the Oral Load: 13C Analysis—At each time point after an oral glucose load, it was assumed that plasma glucose resulted from a combination of gastric absorption, glycogenolysis, and gluconeogenesis from trioses. Given that the oral glucose contained 5% [U-13C]glucose, the probability that two [U-13C3]triose units originally derived from oral glucose recombined to form [U-13C]glucose is at most 0.25% (0.05 × 0.05 less the amount of label lost as a result of entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle). Thus, it was assumed that all [U-13C]glucose present in plasma glucose originated from gastric absorption of oral glucose and not from partial degradation and recombination. The fraction of plasma glucose with an enriched 13C at carbon 1 (g,as defined in Equation 1) was determined by 1H NMR as the fraction of the doublet (because of J CH coupling) in the H1 resonance. Algebraically, this is expressed as g=([1-13C]+[1,2-13C]+[1,2,3-13C]+[U-13C]glucose)/glucose(Eq. 1) The contribution of [U-13C]glucose to this fraction was determined from multiplet areas in the J-HSQC spectrum where the coupling constant J1,3 is small but both J 1,2 and J 1,5 are easily detected. We assumed that any molecule with enrichment in carbon 1, carbon 2, and carbon 5 must reflect [U-13C]glucose. Therefore, the fraction of C-1-enriched glucose contributed by [U-13C]glucose (h) is defined as h=([U-13C]glucose)/([1-13C]+[1,2-13C]+[1,2,3-13C]+[U-13C]glucose)(Eq. 2) To illustrate one example of these calculations, the fraction of plasma glucose enriched in carbon 1 (g) was 0.041 as determined by the 1H NMR spectrum of MAG (not shown). A J-HSQC spectrum of the same sample (Fig. 2, spectrum at 30 min) indicates that the fraction of glucose labeled in C-1 contributed by [U-13C]glucose (h) was 0.59, and the fraction of glucose that was [1,2-13C2]- or [1,2,3-13C3]glucose (i) was 0.12. From these data, the fraction of plasma glucose that is [U-13C]glucose is g × h = 0.041 × 0.59 = 0.02419. However, in this sample the oral glucose contained only 5% [U-13C]glucose, and so the fraction of plasma glucose originating from the stomach, F gastric, was (g × h)/0.05 or 48%. Because total plasma glucose measured 15.8 mm, then 7.6 mm originated from oral glucose. Plasma Glucose Originating from Glycogenolysis or Gluconeogenesis: 2H NMR Analysis—From the combined information in the 1H and J-HSQC spectra, one can conclude that about half of plasma glucose arose from gastric absorption of oral glucose. The remaining glucose resulted from either degradation of glycogen or gluconeogenesis, and this is reported in the 2H NMR spectrum of MAG (23Jones J.G. Solomon M.A. Cole S.M. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E848-E856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as Glucosefromgluconeogenesis=(H5/H2)(Eq. 3) Glucosefromglycogen=1-(H5/H2)(Eq. 4) Integration of 2H and 13C Tracer Observations—Together, these spectra allow a measure of the sources of plasma glucose. Fractionfromthestomach=Fgastric=g*h/0.05(Eq. 5) Fractionfromgluconeogenesis=Fgluconeogenesis=(H5/H2)×(1-g*h/0.05)(Eq. 6) Fractionfromglycogen=Fglycogen=(1-(H5/H2))×(1-g*h/0.05)(Eq. 7) where F gastric + F glycogen + F gluconeogenesis = 1. For example, the 2H spectrum in Fig. 3 indicates that the contribution of glycogen to hepatic glucose production was 1–(H5/H2) = 0.18. Thus, the fraction of plasma glucose that originated from glycogen 30 min after the oral glucose load was (0.18)(1–0.48) or 9.4%. The assumptions that underlie this calculation are reviewed under “Discussion.” Metabolite Assays—Freeze-clamped liver was homogenized in 0.1 n NaOH solution, and the supernatant was incubated at 80 °C for 5 min after centrifugation. Fru-2,6-P2 was assayed by taking advantage of the sensitivity of pyrophosphate:fructose-6-phosphate phosphotransferase to Fru-2,6-P2 as described by Van Schaftingen et al. (24Van Schaftingen E. Lederer B. Bartrons R. Hers H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 129: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Liver glycogen was assayed enzymatically (25Keppler D. Decker K. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1994: 1127-1131Google Scholar), and plasma glucose was measured using a HemoCue glucose analyzer (HemoCue AB, Angelholm, Sweden). Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as means ± S.D. using Microsoft Excel. Linear regression analysis for standard curves was also performed with the same program. Influence of an Oral Glucose Load on Liver Fru-2,6-P 2 and Other Metabolites—The influence of the oral glucose load on hepatic glycogen, Fru-2,6-P2, and plasma glucose is shown in Fig. 4. Plasma glucose peaked at 30 min after the glucose load and decreased gradually thereafter. Liver glycogen was low in 24-h fasted animals but was gradually replenished throughout the study period, reaching a maximum of 31.5 μmol/g at 3 h. This was a significant increase compared with time zero but considerably below the normal level in fed rats (∼200 μmol/g) (26Bergmeyer H.U. Method of Enzymatic Analysis. 2nd ed. 4. Academic Press, New York1974: 2267Google Scholar). Fru-2,6-P2 also increased significantly after the glucose load (Fig. 4). The initial concentration prior to glucose administration was 0.4 ± 0.3 nmol/g of liver, but this was followed by a ∼10-fold increase by 30 min after the glucose load. The time courses of hepatic Fru-2,6-P2 and plasma glucose were roughly parallel. Finally, the amount of 2H2O in plasma water (1.6–1.8%) did not change significantly throughout the study period (Fig. 4). The plasma glucose concentration was somewhat higher than expected for a typical OGTT. Earlier studies (27O'Doherty R.M. Jensen P.B. Anderson P. Jones J.G. Berman H.K. Kearney D. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 47Google Scholar) used indwelling venous catheters for blood drawing in conscious animals, in contrast to our study, in which the liver was removed from anesthetized animals. Therefore, in a smaller group of 24-h fasted rats, glucose (2 g/kg body weight) containing natural abundance levels of 13C was dissolved in H2O and administered by oral gavage, 2 ml of 2H2O was injected into the intraperitoneal cavity, and blood was withdrawn at various time points via the tail vein in the complete absence of anesthesia. In this group, plasma glucose peaked at 7.5 mm at 30 min and decreased to ∼6mm by 180 min (data not shown). This indicates that the high plasma glucose levels reported in Fig. 4 may be attributed in part to the known effects of anesthesia (28van Herck H. Baumans V de Boer S.F. van der Gugten J. van Woerkim A.B. Beynen A.C. Lab. Anim. 1991; 25: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Perez-Llamas F. Zamora S. Rosique M.J. Sastre J.F. Arch. Int. Physiol. Biochim. Biophys. 1992; 100: 335-337PubMed Google Scholar). Effects of an Oral Glucose Load on the 1H, J-HSQC, and 2H Spectra—High resolution 1H NMR spectra of monoacetone glucose showed a fully resolved H1 resonance with well resolved 13C satellite peaks (not shown). The total areas of the 13C satellite wings in these spectra were typically ∼3–4% or ∼7–8% for rats given an oral glucose load containing either 5% [U-13C]glucose or 10% enriched glucose, respectively. The H1 projection of typical J-HSQC spectrum is shown in Fig. 2. Here, the peak labeled quartet (Q) is the dominant multiplet. At a minimum, this glucose isotopomer must be enriched in C-1, C-2, and C-5, and thus it represents [U-13C]glucose from oral glucose that has not undergone metabolism. The doublet (D12) is the signal from glucose isotopomers with 13C at C-1 and C-2 representing [1,2,3-13C3]- or [1,2-13C2]glucose. D12 reflects oral glucose that had been taken either to the level of a triose or the citric acid cycle before being resynthesized to glucose. The singlet (S) represents glucose isotopomers with 13C only at C-1. This peak has contributions from naturally abundant glucose and from singly enriched isotopomers derived from the citric acid cycle. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the Q fraction in these spectra was maximal at 30 min and decreased gradually thereafter, whereas the D12 fraction was minimal at 30 min and increased thereafter. Intraperitoneal injection of 2H2O resulted in rapid equilibration (within 30 min) of 2H into plasma water to a level of 1.6–1.8% excess enrichment (Fig. 4). 2H incorporation into glucose has been reported to occur at various steps along the gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic pathways (Fig. 1), and the 2H spectrum of MAG provides a convenient readout of those exchanges. In the 24-h fasted animals prior to oral glucose, an H5/H2 ratio of 0.79 ± 0.17 indicated that 79% of all plasma glucose containing 2H was produced via gluconeogenesis, whereas the remaining ∼21% came from glycogen. Somewhat surprisingly, the deuterium spectrum did not change significantly after the oral glucose load. The H5/H2 ratio remained relatively constant (0.8 ± 0.2) throughout the study period (Fig. 3, inset), again suggesting that ∼80% of all plasma glucose containing 2H was produced via gluconeogenesis. That portion of plasma glucose arising from the oral load would not be detected by 2H NMR in this experiment unless glucose cycling between plasma and liver was active. The 2H NMR spectra of MAG derived from liver glycogen isolated at 120–180 min also confirmed that hepatic glycogen was derived via gluconeogenesis (H5/H2 = 0.90 ± 0.05). Sources of Plasma Glucose—The contributions of oral glucose, gluconeogenesis, and glycogenolysis to plasma glucose pools are summarized in Fig. 5. At 30 min, about half of the plasma glucose originated from oral glucose, and its contribution decreased gradually thereafter. The gluconeogenic contribution to plasma glucose was substantial throughout the study period (∼5.5–6.7 mm), whereas the contribution of glycogenolysis to plasma glucose was ∼2mm and constant throughout the study period. The purpose of this study was to measure sources of plasma glucose after a gastric load and to determine whether the contribution of gluconeogenesis to hepatic glucose production is suppressed by increased hepatic Fru-2,6-P2. Based on early in vitro reports that Fru-2,6-P2 inhibits fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, it is now standard teaching (30Stryer L. Biochemistry. 4th ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1995: 575Google Scholar) that this inhibition holds true in vivo as well. The 2H NMR results of Fig. 3 show that gluconeogenesis continues even in the presence of substantially increased levels of hepatic Fru-2,6-P2 (Fig. 4), and thus inhibition of gluconeogenesis by Fru-2,6-P2 does not appear to be important in vivo. This result is consistent with a recent report showing that increasing hepatic levels of Fru-2,6-P2 by overexpression of the kinase isoform of phosphofructo-2-kinase resulted in increased glycogen synthesis from [1-13C]glucose via the indirect pathway (14Choi I.Y. Wu C. Okar D.A. Lange A.J. Gruetter R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4418-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This result indicates that Fru-2,6-P2 stimulates glycolysis in vivo but does not inhibit production of glycogen via the indirect pathway. The current investigation also demonstrated that gluconeogenesis is not inhibited substantially after an oral glucose load typical of an OGTT even though liver Fru-2,6-P2 was increased ∼10-fold above fasting levels. This indicates that any inhibition of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase by Fru-2,6-P2 in the in vivo rat liver is not enough to alter gluconeogenesis. Plasma glucose reached higher levels than expected at 30 min post-oral glucose and did not return to pre-oral glucose levels even at 180 min. Thus, the curve shown in Fig. 4 is somewhat elevated compared with that observed for an OGTT in conscious animals (27O'Doherty R.M. Jensen P.B. Anderson P. Jones J.G. Berman H.K. Kearney D. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 47Google Scholar). Dohm et al. (31Dohm G.L. Tapscott E.B. Garris D.R. Biochem. Med. 1983; 30: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) reported that both methoxyflurane (inhalation) and Innovar (intramuscular injection) induce glycogenolysis in rats, with the effect being higher in fed animals than in fasted animals. Thus, the somewhat enhanced levels of plasma glucose found here during the OGTT likely resulted from increased glycogenolysis during exposure of the animals to ether prior to collection of plasma glucose. Increased glycogenolysis, however, does not detract from the primary conclusion of this study because any glycogen degraded in response to anesthesia was synthesized de novo during the OGTT (see Fig. 4, bottom panel). The observation that the H5/H2 ratio in MAG derived from liver glycogen at 180 min was similar to that of plasma glucose demonstrates that gluconeogenesis contributed equally to both. Thus, any glycogenolysis that may have occurred during the short period of anesthesia would have reported the same H5/H2 ratio. The NMR method reported here for detecting persistent gluconeogenesis requires three reasonable assumptions. First, all glucose isotopomers enriched in 13C at carbons 1, 2, and 5 reflect only [U-13C]glucose from oral glucose. The chance that this group of isotopomers could arise from [U-13C]glucose resynthesized after metabolism to a triose is small. If the entire oral glucose load was metabolized to a triose and resynthesized, the chances of [U-13C]glucose reforming would be at best 0.25%, if oral glucose consisted of 5% [U-13C]glucose, and at most 1%, if oral glucose consisted of 10% [U-13C]glucose. This lower limit would be reduced even further in vivo because of dilution of the triose pools by endogenous gluconeogenic precursors. It was also assumed that plasma glucose only arises from three possible sources: gastric absorption, liver glycogenolysis, or liver gluconeogenesis. This assumption excludes other organs as origins of endogenous glucose production. The kidney is also a gluconeogenic organ, but its contribution to blood glucose is not considered significant except during unusual circumstances such as prolonged fasting or acidosis (32Ekberg K. Landau B.R. Wajngot A. Chandramouli V. Efendic S. Brunengraber H. Wahren J. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 33Gerich J.E. Meyer C. Woerle H.J. Stumvoll M. Diabetes Care. 2001; 24: 382-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). A third assumption was that the 2H labeling in glucose reflected recent glucose synthesis. Within 30 min after an oral glucose load, glucose turnover increases from about 15 mg/kg/min at base line to more than 50 mg/kg/min (15Smadja C. Morin J. Ferre P. Girard J. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although glucose turnover was not measured in this study, the gluconeogenic contribution to plasma glucose at 30 min after the oral glucose and 2H2O loads was already significant. Consequently, the gluconeogenic contribution at later time points must also reflect the metabolic activity of each individual time point rather than an accumulated result over the previous periods. Further evidence for rapid glucose turnover is shown by the rapid decline in [U-13C]glucose (originating in the oral load) observed in plasma (Fig. 5), consistent with the high turnover of glucose reported in earlier studies of oral glucose loading in rats (15Smadja C. Morin J. Ferre P. Girard J. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Perturbation of glucose metabolism with an oral load continues to attract interest because it is thought that the post-prandial state accounts for much of the duration of hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes, and because the OGTT is a standard method for diagnosis of abnormalities in carbohydrate metabolism. Despite intensive work, the fate of oral glucose remains surprisingly controversial. Reports of the cumulative appearance of oral glucose in plasma have varied from about 70% (34Delarue J. Couet C. Cohen R. Bréchot J.-F. Antoine J.-M. Lamisse F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E353-E362PubMed Google Scholar, 35Mitrakou A. Kelley D. Veneman T. Jenssen T. Pangburn T. Reilly J. Gerich J. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) to nearly 100% (36Livesey G.P. Wilson D.G. Dainty J.R. Brown J.C. Faulks R.M. Roe M.A. Newman T.A. Eagles J. Mellon F.A. Greenwood R.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E717-E728PubMed Google Scholar, 37Firth R.G. Bell P.M. Marsh H.M. Hansen I. Rizza R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1525-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and the maximal rates of glucose appearance have varied about 2-fold. Livesey et al. (36Livesey G.P. Wilson D.G. Dainty J.R. Brown J.C. Faulks R.M. Roe M.A. Newman T.A. Eagles J. Mellon F.A. Greenwood R.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E717-E728PubMed Google Scholar) reported a study of glucose kinetics in 12-h fasted humans after an oral glucose load, using stable isotopes and mass spectrometry to detect gastric absorption of [13C6]glucose oral glucose. They report that the contribution of hepatic glucose to plasma glucose began to decrease shortly after the oral load from an initial value of near 5 mm to a nadir of 1.1 mm (36Livesey G.P. Wilson D.G. Dainty J.R. Brown J.C. Faulks R.M. Roe M.A. Newman T.A. Eagles J. Mellon F.A. Greenwood R.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E717-E728PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that gluconeogenesis may be more highly regulated in humans after an oral glucose load. However, that study differed from ours in two respects. First, the contribution of hepatic glucose production to plasma glucose was not measured directly but rather was obtained by difference between total plasma glucose (measured analytically) and plasma glucose derived from the oral load (measured as M + 6 by mass spectrometry). It is important to point out that this method cannot distinguish hepatic glucose production from glycogenolysis versus gluconeogenesis, and it is well known that substantial liver glycogen remains after a short 12-h fast in humans. In our experiments with rats, liver glycogen was low after a 24-h fast, and gluconeogenesis was measured directly using the combined 13C and 2H tracers. This has allowed us to demonstrate that gluconeogenesis is not altered after an oral glucose load in this animal model. These study differences emphasize the need to apply simple tracer methods such as the method demonstrated here to assess post-prandial glucose metabolism in humans. The method reported here could easily be applied during an OGTT in humans. A dual isotope technique commonly used for the measurement of oral or endogenous glucose appearance (38Ferrannini E.

In comparison, the approach presented here requires only ingestion of [U-13C]glucose (and 2H2O), yet provides detailed information about the sources of plasma glucose. Such a study in humans could be especially timely because persistent hepatic glucose production after a meal may be an attractive therapeutic target for diabetic patients (17Staehr P.

Substrate targets of the Shk1 kinase have not previously been described. Here we show that the S. pombe cell polarity factor, Tea1, is directly phosphorylated by Shk1 in vitro. We demonstrate further that Tea1 is phosphorylated in S. pombe cells and that its level of phosphorylation is significantly reduced in cells defective in Shk1 function. Consistent with a role for Tea1 as a potential downstream effector of Shk1, we show that a tea1 null mutation rescues the Shk1 hyperactivity-induced lethal phenotype caused by loss of function of the essential Shk1 inhibitor, Skb15. All phenotypes associated with Skb15 loss, including defects in actin cytoskeletal organization, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis, are suppressed by tea1Δ, suggesting that Tea1 is a potential mediator of multiple Shk1 functions. S. pombe cells carrying a weak hypomorphic allele of shk1 together with a tea1Δ mutation exhibit a cytokinesis defective phenotype that is significantly more severe than that observed in the respective single mutants, providing evidence that Shk1 and Tea1 cooperate to regulate cytokinesis. In addition, we show that S. pombe cells carrying the orb2-34 allele of shk1 exhibit a pattern of monopolar growth similar to that observed in tea1Δ cells, suggesting that Shk1 and Tea1 may regulate one or more common processes involved in the regulation of polarized cell growth.

Ras1 interacts with Cdc42 via GTP-dependent complex formation with the presumptive Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Scd1 (26Chang E.C. Barr M. Wang Y. Jung V. Xu H.P. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Like Ras1, Scd1 is required for normal cell shape and mating, but not viability of S. pombe cells. In addition to Cdc42, Shk1 function is positively modulated by at least 3 other nonessential proteins, Scd2 (26Chang E.C. Barr M. Wang Y. Jung V. Xu H.P. Wigler M.H.

Scd2 binds directly to Scd1, Cdc42, and Shk1, and appears to function as a scaffold that positively modulates protein-protein interactions between Scd1 and Cdc42 and between Cdc42 and Shk1 (10Marcus S.

Skb1 and Skb5 appear to be specialized modulators of Shk1 function in that they are required for proper maintenance of cell polarity under hyperosmotic conditions but not under normal growth conditions (30Yang P. Pimental R. Lai H. Marcus S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36052-36057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31Bao S. Qyang Y. Yang P. Kim H. Du H. Bartholomeusz G. Henkel H. Pimental R. Verde F. Marcus S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14549-14552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Shk1 is negatively regulated by a highly conserved WD repeat protein, Skb15 (7Kim H. Yang P. Qyang Y. Lai H. Du H. Henkel J.S. Kumar K. Bao S. Liu M. Marcus S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Loss of Skb15 function is lethal and results in severe morphological, cytoskeletal, mitotic, and cytokinesis defects. Skb15 loss results in hyperactivation of the Shk1 kinase and can be suppressed by mutations that partially inactivate Shk1 (7Kim H. Yang P. Qyang Y. Lai H. Du H. Henkel J.S. Kumar K. Bao S. Liu M. Marcus S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, phenotypes resulting from loss of Skb15 function can be attributed to Shk1 hyperactivity. A mammalian homolog of Skb15 can substitute for its counterpart in S. pombe cells and inhibits PAK activity in mammalian cell cultures, indicating that Skb15-related protein functions have been substantially conserved through evolution (7Kim H.

While substantial progress has been made toward elucidating mechanisms of Shk1 regulation in S. pombe, downstream targets of the Shk1 kinase have not yet been described. Previous studies have demonstrated that Shk1 is a regulator of actin cytoskeletal organization in S. pombe (3Ottilie S. Miller P.J. Johnson D.I. Creasy C.L. Sells M.A. Bagrodia S. Forsburg S.L. Chernoff J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5908-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 18Verde F. Wiley D.J. Nurse P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Newly divided S. pombe cells grow initially in a monopolar fashion from their “old ends.” Subsequently, via a process referred to as new end takeoff (NETO), they initiate growth from the new end created by the cell division and continue to grow in a bipolar fashion until the onset of mitosis (34Mitchison J.M. Nurse P. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 75: 357-376PubMed Google Scholar). Cortical F-actin patches are localized to the growing ends of S. pombe cells, initially to the old ends, then to both ends after NETO (35Marks J. Hagan I.M. Hyams J.S. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1986; 5: 229-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Loss of Shk1 function, either by deletion of the shk1 gene or by overexpression of a kinase defective Shk1 mutant protein, results in the formation of spheroidal cells that exhibit a largely random distribution of cortical F-actin patches (3Ottilie S.

Marcus, unpublished results. By contrast, S. pombe cells rendered hyperactive in Shk1 function as a result of loss of function of the essential Shk1 inhibitor, Skb15, are often branched and/or hyperelongated, and exhibit hyperaccumulations of F-actin in the cytoplasmic space, septum-forming region, and/or cell tips (7Kim H. Yang P. Qyang Y. Lai H. Du H. Henkel J.S. Kumar K. Bao S. Liu M. Marcus S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (15) Google Scholar). An interesting hypomorphic allele of shk1, orb2-34, was identified by Verde et al. (18Verde F. Wiley D.J. Nurse P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7526-7531Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 33Verde F. Mata J. Nurse P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1529-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). S. pombe cells carrying the orb2-34 mutation are viable but monopolar for growth and likewise localize cortical F-actin patches only to the single growing cell tip (36Sawin K.E. Hajibagheri M.A. Nurse P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1335-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Experiments analyzing the localization of cortical cell markers in orb2-34 cells suggest that Shk1 may play a role in the process whereby fission yeast cells recognize their ends as sites for growth (36Sawin K.E. Hajibagheri M.A. Nurse P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1335-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating F-actin cytoskeletal organization, Shk1 is also required for proper organization of both the interphase microtubule cytoskeleton and the mitotic microtubule spindle in S. pombe cells (8Qyang Y. Yang P. Du H. Lai H. Kim H. Marcus S. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As microtubules play an important role in the establishment of cell polarity in S. pombe (37Mata J. Nurse P. Cell. 1997; 89: 939-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 38Sawin K.E. Nurse P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 457-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), it is possible that the regulation of polarized growth by Shk1 involves both actin and microtubule-dependent processes. Consistent with its roles as a regulator of cytoskeletal organization and cell polarity, the Shk1 protein has been shown to localize to the cell ends, septum-forming region, and microtubules in S. pombe cells (8Qyang Y. Yang P. Du H. Lai H. Kim H. Marcus S. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).

While not deleterious to cell growth, loss of Tea1 results in defects in actin and microtubule cytoskeletal organization and cell morphology (33Verde F. Mata J. Nurse P. J.

Similar to S. pombe mutants carrying the orb2-34 allele of shk1, cells carrying a null mutation in the tea1 gene exhibit a monopolar growth defect (37Mata J. Nurse P. Cell. 1997; 89: 939-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). We and other investigators recently showed that a null mutation in the tea1 gene causes growth inhibitory phenotypes when combined with loss of function mutations in genes encoding components of the Ras/Cdc42/Shk1 complex in S. pombe, including ras1, scd1, and shk1 (8Qyang Y.

In this article, we provide evidence that Tea1 is a potential downstream substrate target of the Shk1 kinase.

S. pombe cultures were grown in either YEAU (0.5% yeast extract, 3% dextrose, 75 mg/liter adenine, 75 mg/liter uracil), or synthetic minimal medium (EMM) with appropriate supplements (40Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). Yeast were transformed by the lithium acetate procedure (41Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual.

F-actin (rhodamine-phalloidin), DNA (DAPI), and cell wall (calcofluor) staining of S. pombe cells were performed as described (40Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). Plasmids—The oligonucleotide primers 5′-AAACCCTCGAGTCTGCAGATGTCC-CCTATACTAGGT and 5′-AGGAAGATCTGTCGACGGATCCGATTTTGGAGGAT were used to amplify the glutathione S-transferase (GST) protein coding sequence using the plasmid pRP259 (42Marcus S.

The PCR product was digested with XhoI and BglII then ligated to XhoI-BamHI digested pREP4X (43Maundrell K. J. Biol.

The oligonucleotide primers 5′-TGGTGGATCCTCTCTTTAAAGGAGTAATGTCT and 5′-TATAGAGCTCATCGTCGAATATTTACACTATGT were used to amplify the tea1 protein coding sequence by PCR using a pREP3XTea1 plasmid as a template. The tea1 PCR product was digested with BamHI and SacI for cloning into the corresponding sites of pREP4XGST and the BglII and SacI sites of pREP4XHA (31Bao S. Qyang Y. Yang P. Kim H. Du H.

Preparation of Yeast Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitations, and in Vitro Kinase Assays—S. pombe cells transformed with pREP4XHA or pREP4XHA-Tea1 were grown in EMM containing 50 μm thiamine (EMM+thi) to mid-log phase, washed twice with EMM lacking thiamine (EMM-thi), then subcultured into EMM-thi and grown for 24 h prior to the preparation of cell lysates as described (23Yang P.

Immune complexes were washed three times with YLB and once with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Kinase reactions were performed by resuspending 12.5 μl of packed immune complex beads with 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μm ATP, 0.4 μCi/μl of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol)), and ∼1 ng/μl His6-Shk1 (in control reactions, His6-Shk1 was replaced by an equal volume of His6-Shk1 storage buffer), and incubating for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 3 min. Kinase reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. HA immune complexes were also resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to immunoblotting analysis for the detection of HA-Tea1 protein. GST and GST-Tea1 proteins were expressed and purified from E. coli strain BL-21 using glutathione agarose beads as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). His6-Shk1 was purified from BL-21 using nickel agarose beads according to the manufacturer's specifications (Invitrogen). In vitro kinase assays of purified bacterially expressed proteins were performed as previously described (30Yang P. Pimental R. Lai H. Marcus S. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1966852463,"This study identifies calpain as being instrumental for brush border (BB) microvillus assembly during differentiation and effacement during bacterial pathogenesis. Calpain activity is decreased by 25–80% in Caco 2 lines stably overexpressing calpastatin, the physiological inhibitor of calpain, and the effect is proportional to the calpastatin/calpain ratio. These lines exhibit a 2.5-fold reduction in the rate of microvillus extension. Apical microvillus assembly is reduced by up to 50%, as measured by quantitative fluorometric microscopy (QFM) of ezrin, indicating that calpain recruits ezrin to BB microvilli. Calpain inhibitors ZLLYCHN2, MDL 28170, and PD 150606 block BB assembly and ezrin recruitment to the BB. The HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which inhibits calpain at clinically relevant concentrations, also blocks BB assembly, whereas cathepsin and proteasome inhibitors do not. Microvillus effacement is inhibited after exposure of calpastatin-overexpressing cells to enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. These results suggest that calpain regulates BB assembly as well as pathological effacement, and indicate that it is an important regulator involved in HIV protease inhibitor toxicity and host-microbial pathogen interactions.

Although it is accepted that actin-associated cross-linking and membrane linker proteins such as villin and ezrin, found in intestinal microvilli, are Ca2+-sensitive, the role that Ca2+ plays in the assembly and stability of microvilli is undetermined. Interest in Ca2+ as a regulator of microvillus remodeling has been focused on its role in disrupting villin crosslinks of the microvillus actin filaments (reviewed in Ref. 1Bretscher A. Ciba Found. Symp. 1983; 95: 164-179PubMed Google Scholar) and the activation of the actin filament severing activity of villin. It has been suggested that the Ca2+-dependent protease, calpain, cleaves the membrane linker protein ezrin, during cell motility-associated remodeling of cortical β-actincontaining structures (2Shuster C.B. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 3Shuster C.B. Lin A.Y. Nayak R. Herman I.M. Cell Motil.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Because β-actin is the predominant actin isoform of microvilli (5Hoock T.C. Newcomb P.M. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and because ezrin, which is abundant in microvilli, associates with β-actin in an isoform-specific and calpain-sensitive fashion (2Shuster C.B. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the question has arisen whether calpain regulates β-actin-ezrin interactions in microvilli, and microvillus assembly. Additionally, the finding that calpain levels exceed calpastatin levels in intestinal epithelial cells (6Ibrahim M. Upreti R.K. Kidwai A.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1994; 131: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) suggests that calpain could play a role in intestinal differentiation. Calpain has been implicated in cytoskeletal remodeling, including disruption of cell-matrix interactions at the rear of the cell during crawling (7Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P. Lu Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol.

These examples illustrate the role of calpain in remodeling dynamic actin filament structures at the periphery of the cell. Calpain has not been implicated in assembly of filamentous actin structures in the BB apical domain of enteric epithelial cells or membrane recruitment of ezrin, where it may play an important role in assembly of actin filaments (2Shuster C.B. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 8Defacque H. Egeberg M. Habermann A. Diakonova M. Roy C. Mangeat P. Voelter W. Marriott G. Pfannstiel J. Faulstich H. Griffiths G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A recently developed approach to study the role of calpain in cytoskeletal remodeling has been to create stable transfectants of established cell lines that overexpress calpastatin, calpain's physiological inhibitor (4Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R. Croall D.E. Hughes C.N. Fiacco K.A. Mier J.W. Maki M. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Calpastatin inhibits the ubiquitous calpain isoforms, m- and μ-calpain, so named for their respective millimolar and micromolar Ca2+ ion requirements for activity in vitro. Calpastatin is specific for calpain, regulates no other protease (9Maki M. Hatanaka M. Takano E. Murachi T. Mellgren R.L. Murachi T. Intracellular Calcium-dependent Proteolysis. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 37-54Google Scholar, 10Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 11Croall D.E. McGrody K.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13223-13230Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and is the inhibitor of choice for implicating calpain in biological processes (12Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Pharmacological inhibitors of calpain interact with the cysteine protease or the EF hand domains (13Wang K.K. Posner A. Raser K.J. Buroker-Kilgore M. Nath R. Hajimohammadreza I. Probert A.W. Marcoux F.W. Lunney E.A. Hays S.J. Yuen P.W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 389: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) of calpain and several are used to establish specific involvement of calpain proteases in cellular events. Fast-acting pharmacological inhibitors provide an advantage over antisense and siRNA approaches, which are limited by the 5-day half-life of calpain proteases (14Zhang W. Lane R.D. Mellgren R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18825-18830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For the above reasons we chose to use calpastatin overexpression and combinations of pharmacological inhibitors to determine the role of calpain role in BB 1The abbreviations used are: BB, brush border; EPEC, enteropathogenic E. coli; SEM, scanning electron microscopy; suc-LLVY-AMC: succinyl-leucyl-leucyl-valyl-tyrosyl-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; QFM, quantitative fluorometric microscopy; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; NMPI, normalized mean pixel intensity; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; IF, immunofluorescence.1The abbreviations used are: BB, brush border; EPEC, enteropathogenic E. coli; SEM, scanning electron microscopy; suc-LLVY-AMC: succinyl-leucyl-leucyl-valyl-tyrosyl-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; QFM, quantitative fluorometric microscopy; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; NMPI, normalized mean pixel intensity; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; IF, immunofluorescence. assembly. To determine the role of calpain in BB assembly, calpain activity levels, and corresponding BB microvillus elongation rates as well as ezrin and F-actin recruitment were measured for Caco 2 enterocyte cell lines stably overexpressing calpastatin. Down-regulation of calpain levels and activity were proportional to calpastatin overexpression, as was down-regulation of microvillus elongation. BB ezrin and F-actin recruitment were also blocked by calpastatin overexpression. The calpain inhibitors ZLLYCHN2, MDL28170, and PD 150606 also blocked BB assembly and ezrin recruitment. These results indicate that the calpain regulates assembly of the enterocyte BB, in part through regulation of ezrin recruitment. Calpastatin overexpression also conferred resistance to EPEC-initiated effacement. These findings indicate dynamic roles for calpain in epithelial morphogenesis and modulation of host-bacterial interactions during bacterial pathogenesis. Cell Culture—Caco 2a enterocytes (from Douglas Jefferson, Tufts University), were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum (Invitrogen), l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (complete medium, CM) at 5% CO2 (Revco Ultima Incubator). The Caco 2 enterocytes used in these studies are the Caco 2a subclone, which polarize and form tight junctions rapidly (15Griffiths J.K. Moore R. Dooley S. Keusch G.T. Tzipori S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4506-4514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clones stably transfected with the calpastatin expression plasmid pRC/CMV-Δ3CSN were grown in the above medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418. Transfection and Selection of Calpastatin-overexpressing Clonal Cell Lines—A previously described calpastatin expression construct (4Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R. Croall D.E. Hughes C.N.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), pRC/CMV-Δ3CSN, expressed the full-length human calpastatin exon 3-deleted (Δ3) cDNA (16Asada K. Ishino Y. Shimada M. Shimojo T. Endo M. Kimizuka F. Kato I. Maki M. Hatanaka M. Murachi T. J. Enzyme Inhib. 1989; 3: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), corresponding to one of the major calpastatin splicing isoforms in enterocytes. Caco 2a cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and selected in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418. G418-resistant clonal cell colonies were lifted with trypsin/EDTA (0.05%/0.53 mm)-saturated sterile filter paper and cultured in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418. The cell lines, 0.5-11, 2-1, 2-3, 2-6, and 2-7, transfected with pRC/CMV-Δ3CSN, overexpressed calpastatin ≥2-fold. The C9 and C12 control cell lines transfected with pRC/CMV were selected under identical conditions. The Caco 2 lines stored were passage 15 from the original stock of Caco 2 cells. Multiple equivalent frozen stocks were made within passages 3–5 and stored in liquid nitrogen. Passage of thawed cells was limited to 4–6 weeks. Quantitation of Calpastatin, m-Calpain, and Cytoskeletal Calpain Substrates in Caco 2 Clonal Cell Lines—Cytoplasmic and membrane/cytoskeletal extracts were made by Dounce homogenization of cells and differential centrifugation of the lysate, in the presence of protease inhibitors, as described (4Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R. Croall D.E. Hughes C.N. Fiacco K.A. Mier J.W. Maki M. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic extract contained ∼95% of the extranuclear protein, and the membrane/cytoskeletal fraction, 5%. Immunoblot analysis of cytoplasmic extracts was performed after SDS-PAGE and transfer to 0.2 μm nitrocellulose filters. Blots were blocked (5% nonfat dry milk, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol) overnight and probed with primary antibodies, including monoclonal murine anti-human calpastatin PC-6 (17Lane R.D.

Croall, University of Maine) (18Croall D.E. Slaughter C.A. Wortham H.S. Skelly C.M. DeOgny L. Moomaw C.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1121: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), monoclonal murine anti-human ezrin-specific antibody 3C12 (Sigma), which reacted with a single 80-kDa protein in Caco 2 cell extracts, rabbit polyclonal ezrin-specific antibody 7-130 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), rabbit anti-human β-actin (5Hoock T.C. Newcomb P.M. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and monoclonal murine anti-human villin (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA). Secondary antisera were horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) or goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad). Proteins were detected using the chemiluminescent peroxidase system (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to film. The relative levels of antigens were quantified by densitometry and the Gelblot-Pro program (UV Products, San Gabriel, CA). Calpain Activity in Clonal Calpastatin-overexpressing Caco 2-derived Cell Lines—Calpain activity in cell suspensions was determined by measuring Ca2+-ionophore-specific hydrolysis of the peptidyl 7-amino bond of the calpain substrate succinyl-leucyl-leucyl-valyl-tyrosyl-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (suc-LLVY-AMC) (19Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G744-G751PubMed Google Scholar) as previously described (4Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R. Croall D.E. Hughes C.N. Fiacco K.A. Mier J.W. Maki M. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Fluorimetry was performed with stirring at 37 °C, with a PerkinElmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer. The initial rate of substrate cleavage in the absence of ionomycin was subtracted from the initial rate in the presence of ionomycin to determine the rate of Ca2+-dependent cleavage of the substrate. Scanning Electron Microscopy—Caco 2 cells (5 × 106) were plated on sterile glass coverslips in 35-mm plate wells. After 16 h, the medium was changed to remove non-adherent cells. Confluent monolayers were fixed in complete medium (CM) containing 3.7% formaldehyde, at 54 h of culture. Coverslips were dehydrated for 10 min in hexamethyldisilazane (100%), air-dried, and sputter-coated with gold/palladium. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using an ISI-DS-130 scanning electron microscope. In time course experiments, cells were plated, and the medium was changed at 2 h to remove non-adherent cells. Slides were fixed at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h. SEM images were obtained of the apical microvilli, at ×18,400 magnification. Analysis of SEM images indicated that BB assembly rates could be assayed by measurement of apical non-border microvilli. Microvilli at the border areas of cells were not measured, because border microvilli were tightly clustered. Microvillus Morphometry and Measurement of Microvillus Elongation Rates—SEM images of Caco 2 cell monolayers photographed at 18,400x magnification were scanned from Polaroid photographs and stored as Adobe Photoshop TIFF files (256 level gray scale). Each image contained a size bar generated by the scanning electron microscope. At least two separate micrographs, each containing several hundred apical microvilli, were measured for each condition. Automated morphometry of the apical microvilli was done using Metamorph 5.0r. Four filtering functions identified measurable apical microvilli. The first level of filtering involved thresholding to eliminate background surrounding the microvilli, which consisted primarily of pits and pockmarks in the apical membrane. Thresholding was done without significant loss of microvillus images, because of the high contrast of the microvilli. The second level of filtering involved gating objects to be measured on the basis of object width. Objects that were within ± 1 S.D. of the mean fiber width were retained for length measurement. The third level of filtering involved rejection of objects lacking a centriod within the measured object, suggestive of overlapping microvilli. The fourth level of filtering involved removal of objects touching the edges of the image. Filtering left 150–225 measurable microvilli per image and these were used to measure mean microvillus length. Calibration using the original size bar was used to convert all measurements to nanometers. The results obtained by automated microvillus morphometry were qualitatively comparable to curvilinear measurement of microvillus length of all measurable microvilli in the image, using NIH Image 1.61 (data not shown). Ezrin Immunofluorescent Antibody Staining of Assembling BB— Caco 2 cells were plated on collagen type I (10 μg/ml, 2 h, 37 °C)-coated 8 well Lab-Tek II chamber slide system at 5 × 105 cells per well (0.7 cm2) and incubated in a tissue culture incubator under 5% CO2. Caco 2 cells plated under these conditions, in fresh complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum), form polarized monolayers within 2 h, exhibiting polygonal borders and apical microvilli, as assayed by phalloidin or ezrin antibody staining. Two hours after plating, non-adherent cells were removed by gentle pipetting, and fresh complete medium was added. The 6 h time point was chosen for assay, because it exhibited the largest difference in BB assembly. At the assay end point slides were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PiBS (PIPES buffer saline; 15 mm PIPES-OH, pH 7.0 and 140 mm NaCl) for 20 min at room temperature, rinsed three times with PiBS, and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PiBS for 20 s. After blocking for 30 min in PiBS with protease free 0.2% BSA (Sigma) (PiBS/BSA), all 8 cell patches on the slide were overlaid with a solution of rabbit polyclonal ezrin-specific peptide antibody (USB 7-130) (20Kondo T.

The ezrin antibody is a protein A-purified IgG rabbit antibody to the peptide CEPVSYHVQESLQDEGAEPTG, amino acids 497–498 of human ezrin. The ezrin antibody used for these studies stained only apical microvilli and junctional microvilli at the junctions between cells and no other structures. Slides were washed three times with PiBS/BSA and incubated with FITC-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL) for 1 h. To capture the maximum number of apical non-border microvilli per cell, the cell monolayers were photographed in the focal plane of the border microvilli using an epifluorescence microscope (Axioskop, Zeiss) equipped with a Spot Insight CCD camera, using the ×100 oil objective. Digital images were saved as TIFF files using Spot software 2.3 (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc, Sterling Heights, MI). Quantitative Fluorometric Assay of BB Assembly—QFM assay measures BB assembly per cell by determining mean pixel intensity per cell of apical non-border microvillus staining with ezrin antibody 7-130/goat anti-rabbit-FITC. Cell patches (experimental and at least one control) in the wells of Lab-TEK II slides were stained under identical conditions for each slide (see ezrin immunofluorescent antibody staining, above). The image capture method used a Spot cooled CCD camera driven by the Spot 3.5 program. A 4-s exposure time was used for all images. The 4-s exposure time for the ezrin-stained monolayers resulted in less than 5% pixel saturation for the brightest image, based on the pixel intensity histogram (256 level grayscale). Captured images were focused in the plane of the intensely staining borders of the cells, which allowed the maximal number of apical non-border microvilli to be in focus. Previously unviewed areas of each cell patch were captured to avoid FITC bleaching. The TIFF image files were opened in NIH Image 1.63 and inverted. For each cell, the polygon tool was used to outline the area of apical non-border microvilli that was in focus. Out-of-focus microvilli over the perinuclear convexity near the center of the cell were excluded from analysis, as were the cell borders. Mean pixel intensity per cell was determined. The normalized mean pixel intensity (NMPI) per cell is reported, with a p value derived from a Student's t test for unpaired data with equal variance. The maximal reduction of NMPI per cell measured by this method was 50% (0.5-11 versus C9). This method can measure a 15% reduction in NMPI per cell (p < 0.05) with a sample size of 40 cells. Treatment of Caco 2 Cells with Protease Inhibitors—Caco 2 cells grown to 50–70% confluence and were then treated with vehicle (0.5% Me2SO), carbobenzyloxy-Leu-Leu-Tyr-diazomethyl ketone (ZLLYCHN2) (25 μm), MDL 28,170 (50 μm), PD 150606 (50 μm), ritonavir 50 (μm) (HPLC-purified from pharmaceutical material), or lactacystin (1 μm), for 24 h in Me2SO (≤ 0.5%). The cells were replated on collagen-coated Lab-Tek II 8 chamber slides in the presence of inhibitor. Microvillus assembly was measured by ezrin immunofluorescence staining by the QFM assay described above. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Sterile glass coverslips were seeded with calpastatin-overexpressing Caco 2 line 2-1, which overexpresses calpastatin 2-fold or controls (C9). Cells were plated at 4-fold over confluence density. The medium was changed to remove non-adherent cells, at 16 h, and the monolayers were fixed in PBS containing 4% formaldehyde, at 54 h. The cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.1%) for 1 min, stained with Oregon-Green phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and photographed by fluorescence microscopy, as described (4Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R. Croall D.E. Hughes C.N. Fiacco K.A. Mier J.W. Maki M. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy was performed with a Nikon inverted fluorescence microscope interfaced with a Noran laser illuminator, automated stage micrometer and digital CCD camera. Thirty images, at 500-nm spacing along the z-axis, were stored and reconstructed using Intervision 2D/3D software and a Silicon Graphics workstation. EPEC-mediated BB Effacement—Caco 2 cells were plated on Permanox 4-well microscope slides. The medium was changed at 2 h and non-adherent cells were removed. The monolayers were cultured in CM in the presence of G418 for 2 weeks, with changes of medium every 3 days. The EPEC strain 2348/69 (EAF+/EAE+) was grown from fresh overnights in LB supplemented with mannose. At an OD of 0.8–0.9, in log-phase growth, EPEC were harvested, washed in HBS, and resuspended in CM without antibiotics. Monolayers were infected for 30 min at 37 °C or mock-infected with CM without bacteria. At the end of infection, monolayers were washed four times in warm phosphate-buffered saline (37 °C) and fixed in warm 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 100 mm sodium cacodylate (37 °C). Staining for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was with 0.1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h at room temperature (22Herman I.M. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). TEM was performed with a Philips CM-10 electron microscope. Micrograph prints were digitized with an Agfa flat bed scanner and analyzed in Adobe Photoshop 4.0. m-Calpain is Down-regulated in Calpastatin-overexpressing Caco 2 Cells—To determine whether calpain plays a role in epithelial cell BB assembly, the Δ3 isoform of calpastatin was over-expressed in Caco-2a enterocytes. 10 of 30 selected clonal lines were analyzed for calpastatin overexpression. Of the 10 lines screened by Western blotting, 5 lines demonstrated 2.0–2.5-fold calpastatin overexpression and were further studied. Control cell lines, C9 and C12, were chosen from 10 identically derived cell lines transfected with the empty vector, pRC/CMV. Calpastatin is increased 2-fold in the cytoplasmic extracts of the lower overexpressing lines 2-1, 2-3, 2-6, and 2-7 and 2.4-fold in the higher overexpressing cell line 0.5-11. To determine whether limited (up to 2.5-fold) calpastatin overexpression observed in clonal Caco 2 lines is due to decreased clonogenicity related to increasing calpastatin overexpression, the C9, 2-3, and 0.5-11 lines were plated at 1000, 500, and 100 cells per well in 96-well plates and cell number was determined by MTT assay. Cell recovery, measured at 24 h was highest for the C9 line, intermediate for the 2-3 line, and lowest for the 0.5-11 line, at all densities tested. At a plating density of 100 cells per well, no 0.5-11 cells could be detected at 24 h 2A. Srirangam and D. Potter, unpublished results. and the 2-3 cells were reduced in recovery compared with the C9 line. These results indicate that calpastatin overexpression, as low as 2.4-fold, blocks recovery of clonal calpastatin over-expressing Caco 2 cell lines, and this may explain the near absence of Caco 2 lines expressing high levels of calpastatin. Calpastatin overexpression stably down-regulates the predominant calpain isoform, m-calpain (Table I), in proportion to the calpastatin/calpain ratio. The lower and higher over-expressor lines demonstrate calpastatin levels 2-fold or 2.5-fold background, respectively (Table I). Cytosolic m-calpain levels are reduced by 40% in the lower and higher calpastatin overexpressors (Table I). The lower and higher over-expressor lines, 2-3 and 0.5-11, respectively, demonstrate calpastatin/calpain ratios of 3:1 and 4:1 (Table I) and have calpain activities 73 and 22% of control, as determined by fluorometric measurement of cleavage of suc-LLVY-AMC (Fig. 1). These results indicate that a small change of the calpastatin/calpain ratio markedly affects calpain activity. This is consistent with the notion that the calpastatin/calpain ratio is tightly regulated in mammalian cells and directly modulates calpain activity (4Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R.

This fraction represents about 5% of the total extranuclear protein. Membrane/cytoskeleton calpastatin was increased 1.6-fold in the highest over-expressor line, 0.5-11, and the calpastatin/calpain ratio was increased 1.4-fold, while the low over-expressor line, 2-3, exhibited a 1.2-fold increase of the calpastatin/calpain ratio (Table II). Membrane/cytoskeletal ezrin and villin were decreased up to 50% in calpastatin-overexpressing lines (Table II). These results indicate that calpastatin overexpression changes the calpastatin/calpain ratio in the cytosolic rather than in the membrane/cytoskeletal fraction and that trafficking of ezrin and villin to the membrane/cytoskeletal fraction is impaired by inhibition of calpain. The decrease of ezrin in the membrane/cytoskeletal fraction is consistent with impairment of BB assembly in calpastatin-overexpressing Caco 2 cell lines (Fig. 2, A and B).Table IIComparison of steady-state levels of calpain and calpastatin-associated proteins in the BB membrane/cytoskeleton fraction of calpastatin-overexpressing cell lines compared to an empty vector cell lineCalpain-associated proteinLower calpastatin over-expressor cell lineHigher calpastatin over-expressor cell linenormalized mean ± S.D.normalized mean ± S.D.Calpastatin0.92 ± 0.081.6 ± 0.33m-Calpain0.80 ± 0.241.1 ± 0.45Calpastatin:m-Calpain ratio1.21.4Ezrin0.86 ± 0.250.54 ± 0.13Villin0.44 ± 0.140.77 ± 0.22β-Actin0.93 ± 0.0800.91 ± 0.12 Open table in a new tab Calpastatin Overexpression Decreases the Rate of Apical Microvillus Elongation During BB Assembly—Because calpain promotes assembly of β-actin and ezrin-rich cortical structures during cell motility (4Potter D.A.

https://openalex.org/W2065546878,"Members of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines exert their biological effects via binding to their cognate ligand-binding receptor subunit on a target cell. The subsequent recruitment of the common signal transducer glycoprotein 130 and activation of the JAK/STAT and SHP-2/Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are responsible for the majority of cellular responses elicited by IL-6 cytokines. Several types of experiments suggest that the Src family of kinases (SFK) also participates in IL-6 family cytokine-mediated signaling events. SYF cells, which lack expression of SFKs Src, Yes, and Fyn, were used to determine the role of SFKs in IL-6 family cytokine signaling and gene induction. SYF and wild type (WT) control fibroblasts displayed similar activation of signaling intermediates following stimulation with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LIF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 and subsequent activation of MAPK in SYF cells were identical to that seen in LIF-stimulated WT cells. Both LIF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, as well as LIF-stimulated DNA binding activity of STAT-containing nuclear complexes were indistinguishable when compared in SYF and WT cells. In addition, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-sensitive Akt kinase and p38 MAPK were activated by LIF in both SYF and WT cells. Furthermore, LIF-stimulated expression of c-fos, egr-1, and suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 was retained in SYF cells. The IL-6 family cytokine oncostatin M was also capable of activating MAPK, STAT3, STAT1, Akt, and p38 in both WT and SYF cells. These results demonstrate that IL-6 family cytokines can activate a full repertoire of signaling pathways and induce gene expression independent of SFKs."
https://openalex.org/W2098805557,"Store-operated calcium channels (SOC) play a central role in cellular calcium homeostasis. Although it is well established that SOC are activated by depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores, the molecular mechanism underlying this effect remains ill defined. It has been suggested that SOC activation requires fusion of endomembrane vesicles with the plasmalemma. In this model, SNARE-dependent exocytosis is proposed to deliver channels or their activators to the surface membrane to initiate calcium influx. To test this hypothesis, we studied the requirement for membrane fusion events in SOC activation, using a variety of dominant-negative constructs and toxins that interfere with SNARE function. Botulinum neurotoxin A (BotA), which cleaves SNAP-25, did not prevent SOC activation. Moreover, SNAP-25 was not detectable in the cells where BotA was reported earlier to inhibit SOC. Instead, the BotA-insensitive SNAP-23 was present. Impairment of VAMP function was similarly without effect on SOC opening. We also tested the role of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, a global regulator of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. Expression of a mutated N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor construct inhibited all aspects of membrane traffic tested, including recycling of transferrin receptors to the plasma membrane, fusion of endosomes with lysosomes, and retrograde traffic to the Golgi complex. Despite this global inhibition of vesicular fusion, which was accompanied by gross alterations in cell morphology, SOC activation persisted. These observations cannot be easily reconciled with the vesicle-mediated coupling hypothesis of SOC activation. Our findings imply that the SOC and the machinery necessary to activate them exist in the plasma membrane or are associated with it prior to activation.

In excitable cells, Ca2+ can enter the cytosol via voltagegated channels. A variety of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels have been described in neuronal, neuroendocrine, and muscle cells, and some of them are also present and active in nonexcitable cells (see Ref. 1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar for review). However, a different type of channels is thought to be the primary route of Ca2+ influx when nonexcitable cells are activated by hormones, growth factors, and other agonists (2Zitt C. Halaszovich C.R. Luckhoff A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 243-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Such channels open in response to depletion of an intracellular Ca2+ reservoir, thought to be (a part of) the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; BotA, botulinum toxin; [Ca2+]cyt, cytosolic free Ca2+; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; SNAP-25, synaptosomal associated protein of 25 kDa; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptor; SOC, store-operated channels; TeTX, tetanus toxin; TG, thapsigargin; TRP, transient receptor potential; AM, acetoxymethylester; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent proteins. and are therefore referred to as store-operated calcium channels (SOC). Unlike voltage-gated channels, which have been definitively identified and reconstituted in model systems, the molecular identity of SOC has not been conclusively established. Evidence has mounted implicating members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels as responsible for SOC-mediated Ca2+ influx. In support of this notion, Freichel et al. (3Freichel M. Suh S.H. Pfeifer A. Schweig U. Trost C. Weissgerber P. Biel M. Philipp S. Freise D. Droogmans G. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Nilius B. Nat.

Further, heterologously expressed TRPC1, TRPC2, TRPC3, and TRPC7 have all been reported to be activated in response to depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (4Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G.

Not only is the identity of the channels incompletely defined, but the mechanism whereby they are activated by depletion of the stores is even more obscure. Three general hypotheses have been proposed to account for this transfer of information: (i) diffusion of a small messenger molecule liberated from the stores that activates a putative receptor at the plasma membrane, which could conceivably be the channel itself (11Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar); (ii) direct physical coupling between sensors of the Ca2+ content of the stores and the SOCs (12Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar); in this hypothesis, transmembrane elements of the ER would be docked with the SOC either directly or through mediation of other proteins, thereby controlling the state of channel opening; and (iii) vesicle-mediated coupling between the stores and plasmalemmal channels (13Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The activation of the conductance can, according to this last model, be envisaged to result from delivery to the plasma membrane of channel activators or of the active channels themselves. The vesicular delivery hypothesis is supported indirectly by the observation that assembly of a rigid actin meshwork underneath the plasma membrane impairs SOC activation in a variety of cells (13Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 14Ma H.T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 42401-42408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This can be interpreted to result from the imposition of a physical barrier to vesicular traffic from the ER to the plasmalemma (13Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). More direct support for the vesicular theory stems from reports that constituents of the membrane fusion machinery are required for SOC activation. The strongest evidence was provided by reports of a strict requirement for soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) molecules in channel activation. SNAREs are membrane-tethered molecules that are thought to bring cognate bilayers in very tight apposition, promoting their fusion. After fusion, the SNARE complexes are disassembled by N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), a soluble hexameric ATPase, allowing the SNAREs to be recycled for another round of fusion (16Littleton J.T. Barnard R.J. Titus S.A. Slind J. Chapman E.R. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12233-12238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Several recent reports have strongly implicated vesicular transport and the SNAREs in the activation of SOC. Measurements of store-operated calcium current in Xenopus oocytes revealed that microinjection of botulinum neurotoxin A (BotA) strongly inhibited SOC activation (17Yao Y. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Tsien R.Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 475-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). BotA exerts its biological effects by specific cleavage of the synaptosomal associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25), one of the SNARE proteins (18Blasi J. Chapman E.R. Link E. Binz T. Yamasaki S. De Camilli P. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. Jahn R. Nature. 1993; 365: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 19Schiavo G. Santucci A. Dasgupta B.R. Mehta P.P. Jontes J. Benfenati F. Wilson M.C. Montecucco C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The involvement of SNAP-25 in SOC coupling was further suggested by the observation that introduction of truncated mutants of this SNARE into the oocytes similarly depressed activation of the current (17Yao Y. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Tsien R.Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 475-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Moreover, evidence for a role of SNAREs in SOC activation has also been obtained in mammalian cells. Microinjection of BotA or of tetanus toxin (TeTX) into HEK 293 cells resulted in inhibition of SOC activation in response to store depletion (20Alderton J.M. Ahmed S.A. Smith L.A. Steinhardt R.A. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Like BotA, TeTX also alters fusion events by effecting proteolysis of SNAREs, but its substrate specificity differs, targeting exclusively members of the VAMP (vesicle associated membrane protein) family, particularly VAMP2 and VAMP3 (21Rossetto O. Seveso M. Caccin P. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 27-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 22Schiavo G. Benfenati F. Poulain B. Rossetto O. Polverino de Laureto P. DasGupta B.R. Montecucco C. Nature. 1992; 359: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). Despite this tantalizing evidence, questions remain regarding the requirement for SNAREs in SOC activation. In particular, the inhibitory effect of BotA is somewhat unexpected, because the presence of its substrate, SNAP-25, has not been documented in either oocytes or HEK 293 cells. SNAP-25 is primarily expressed in neurons and neuroendocrine cells, but elsewhere it is poorly expressed, if at all (23Brumell J.H. Volchuk A. Sengelov H. Borregaard N. Cieutat A.M. Bainton D.F. Grinstein S. Klip A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5750-5759PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Instead, most nonexcitable tissues are rich in a related isoform, SNAP-23, which fulfills in these cells the same functional role attributed to SNAP-25 in neurons (24Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). However, unlike SNAP-25, in most mammalian species, SNAP-23 lacks the cleavage site targeted by BotA and is therefore totally insensitive to this toxin. This raises the possibility that, instead of or in addition to SNAP-23, HEK 293 cells also express the toxin-sensitive SNAP-25. Alternatively, it is possible that BotA exerted its effects in a manner that does not involve the cleavage of SNAREs. In the latter case, the vesicular coupling hypothesis of SOC activation would need to be revisited. The objective of the present experiments was to re-examine the role of SNAREs in SOC activation in an attempt to validate the hypothesis of vesicular mediation. To this end we analyzed the presence of SNAP-23 and SNAP-25 in non-neuronal mammalian cells, including HEK 293, and analyzed their contribution to SOC activation. In addition, we reassessed the effects of TeTX on channel opening, to evaluate the involvement of VAMP-2 and VAMP-3. Lastly, because other VAMP isoforms are insensitive to TeTX and may conceivably substitute for the toxin-sensitive species, we used a more global inhibitor of SNARE-mediated fusion events. To this end, the cells were transfected with a dominant-negative mutant of NSF and used to monitor Ca2+ homeostasis. Although these procedures were verified to inhibit the traffic of the intended vesicles, often causing major alterations in cell morphology, no effect on store-operated Ca2+ influx was detected. Our observations cannot be easily reconciled with the vesicle-mediated coupling hypothesis of SOC activation.

Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Pierce. Cholera toxin B-subunit conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine was purchased from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA). Tetramethylrhodamine-labeled transferrin and dextran (molecular weight, 10,000) and Fura-2-AM were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Ionomycin and thapsigargin were acquired from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Tissue culture supplies were obtained from CellGro (Herndon, VA) and Wisent (St. Bruno, Canada). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise stated. Cell Culture, Plasmids, and Transfection—COS-1 and HEK 293 cells were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The cells were seeded on 25-mm glass coverslips the day before transfection. The peGFP-N1 plasmid was purchased from Clontech Laboratories Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). The plasmids encoding wild-type NSF (NSFwt) and NSF with the E329Q mutation (NSFE329Q) were described earlier (25Coppolino M.G. Kong C. Mohtashami M. Schreiber A.D. Brumell J.H. Finlay B.B. Grinstein S. Trimble W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4772-4780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding the wild-type SNAP-23 (SNAP-23wt) and SNAP-23 with a 9-residue carboxyl-terminal truncation (SNAP-23CΔ9) were the generous gift of Dr. H. Gaisano (University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada). cDNA encoding the light chains of BotA and TeTX was kindly provided by the late Dr. H. Niemann and cloned into pcDNA for expression in mammalian cells. For some experiments, the vector of interest was co-transfected with 110 the amount of the eGFP-N1 vector to identify transfected cells. Plasmids for transfection were purified using the QIAfilter Maxi Prep Kit (Qiagen). For transfection cells were grown to 50–60% confluence and treated with the plasmids plus FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were used for the experiments 16–19 h after transfection. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—The cells were grown in 6-well tissue culture plates and solubilized in Laemmli's sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide (12%) gel electrophoresis using the Protean II minigel system (Bio-Rad), and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then immersed overnight in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, consisting of 100 mm Tris/HCl, 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, pH 7.5) supplemented with 5% milk and 0.05% Tween 20 at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The blots were incubated with anti-SNAP-23 antibody (1:250) and anti-SNAP-25 antibody (1:250) for1hat room temperature, then washed four times for 15 min each in TBS with 0.05% Tween 20, and next incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000) for 1 h. The membranes were washed twice for 15 min in TBS with 0.05% Tween 20 followed by two more 15-min washes with TBS, and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Immunostaining and Fluorescence Microscopy—The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min at room temperature and washed with 100 mm glycine in PBS for 10 min. The fixed cells were then permeabilized and blocked with 0.1% Triton X-100 containing 5% powdered milk for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies, followed by the secondary antibodies, were added to the coverslips in PBS with 5% milk for 45 min at 37 °C. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS after each antibody incubation. To assess transferrin uptake, transferrin-rhodamine (25 μg/ml) was added for 45 min, followed by two quick washes with DMEM, pH 5.5, to remove surface-bound transferrin. The coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using fluorescent mounting medium (Dako Corporation, Carpinteria, CA). The fluorescence images were captured using a Leica DM IRB microscope under a 100× oil immersion objective using standard fluorescein isothiocyanate/Cy3 filter sets. The digital images were prepared using Adobe Photoshop® 6.0 and Adobe Illustrator® 10 software. Measurements of Cytosolic Free Ca2 + ([Ca2 + ] cyt )—The cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and, when necessary, were transfected 16–19 h before the measurements were initiated. The coverslips for cells transfected with NSFE329Q were precoated with Cell-Tak Cell Adhesive (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were washed with DMEM once and loaded with 2 μg/ml Fura-2-AM in DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Where specified, the cells were exposed to labeled transferrin during this period. The coverslip was then placed in a thermostatted Leiden chamber holder on the stage of a microscope (IM-35; Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped with a 40×, 0.75 numerical aperture UV-I objective. A filter wheel (Sutter Instruments) was used to alternately position the two excitation filters (340 ± 10 and 380 ± 10 nm; Chroma Technologies Corp., Brattleboro, VT) in front of a mercury lamp. The excitation light was directed to the cells via a 400-nm dichroic mirror. The data were recorded every 20 s by irradiating the cells for 1200 ms (340 nm) and 400 ms (380 nm) at each of the excitation wavelengths followed by acquisition of a bright field image using Nomarski optics. Image acquisition was controlled by Metafluor software V3.5 (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). The emitted light was directed onto a dual bandpass (515 and 660 nm) emission filter placed in front of a 1317 × 1035 frame transfer-cooled CCD camera set to bin pixels by 8 (Princeton Research Instruments Inc., Princeton, NJ). The bright field image was continuously monitored by placing a second 620-nm dichroic mirror in the light path to direct the nearly infrared light to a CCD-72 video camera (Dage MTI, Michigan City, IN). After mounting, the cells were washed once with Ca2+-containing solution (140 nm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, 100 μm EGTA, 1.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4), and transfected cells were identified by detection of the eGFP co-expressed with the vector of interest. Alternatively, the cells that were preincubated with labeled transferrin were washed twice with medium at pH 5.5 to remove exofacial ligand, and transfectants were identified by the absence of internalized transferrin-rhodamine. After basal [Ca2+]cyt measurements were made, the cells were placed in Ca2+-free solution (140 nm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2,10mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, 100 μm EGTA, pH 7.4), and SOC activity was assessed. The ratio of F 340 nm/F 380 nm for each cell was then normalized to the maximum determined in each individual measurements by treatment with 10 μm ionomycin in Ca2+-containing solution. SNAP-25, SNAP-23, and the Activation of SOCs—Although SNAP-23 and SNAP-25 have a great deal of structural homology, fundamental differences exist in both their tissue distribution and their susceptibility to proteolytic toxins. Although SNAP-25 expression is confined almost exclusively to the brain and pancreatic β-cells, SNAP-23 is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues (24Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 26Sadoul K. Lang J. Montecucco C. Weller U. Regazzi R. Catsicas S. Wollheim C.B. Halban P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Further, unlike SNAP-25, human SNAP-23 is insensitive to cleavage by BotA (27Vaidyanathan V.V. Yoshino K. Jahnz M. Dorries C. Bade S. Nauenburg S. Niemann H. Binz T. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To resolve the uncertainties surrounding the mechanism of the BotA-induced inhibition of SOCs in non-neuronal cells, we initially defined the SNAREs expressed in HEK 293 and COS-1 cells. The former cell line was used by Alderton et al. (20Alderton J.M. Ahmed S.A. Smith L.A. Steinhardt R.A. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of BotA, whereas the latter cells are a very commonly used, readily transfectable mammalian cell model. Whole cell lysates were prepared, separated by SDS-PAGE, and probed for expression of SNAP-23 and SNAP-25 by immunoblotting. In contrast to a rat brain lysate, used as a positive control, neither HEK 293 nor COS-1 cell lysates had detectable levels of SNAP-25 (Fig. 1A). It is noteworthy that the antibody used recognizes SNAP-25 in all mammalian species tested, including primates. 2C. C. Scott, W. Furuya, W. S. Trimble, and S. Grinstein, unpublished observations. This is consistent with the renal origin of both of these cell lines. By contrast, both HEK 293 and COS-1 cells express high levels of the non-neuronal homologue, SNAP-23, which was also clearly expressed in spleen but only marginally in brain lysates (Fig. 1B). Together, these results indicate that SNAP-23, and not SNAP-25, is the dominant species in both the HEK 293 and COS-1 cell lines, casting doubt on the interpretation of the effects of BotA reported in these cells (20Alderton J.M. Ahmed S.A. Smith L.A. Steinhardt R.A. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We next tested whether the SNAP-23 was required for SOC activation in non-neuronal cells. To this end, we transfected COS-1 cells with a mutated SNAP-23 lacking the 9 carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues. This truncated form (SNAP-23CΔ9), which simulates the cleavage product of BotA, has been found to exert a potent dominant-negative effect on SNAP-23-mediated secretion (28Huang X. Sheu L. Tamori Y. Trimble W.S. Gaisano H.Y. Pancreas. 2001; 23: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To confirm that expression of SNAP-23CΔ9 inhibited vesicular transport in COS-1 cells, we compared the effects of SNAP-23CΔ9 and full-length, wild-type SNAP-23 (SNAP-23wt) on transferrin recycling. Consistent with previous reports (29Leung S.M. Chen D. DasGupta B.R. Whiteheart S.W. Apodaca G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17732-17741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we found that expression of SNAP-23CΔ9 induced a profound inhibition of transferrin recycling (≈80%; Fig. 2C). By contrast, transfection of the SNAP-23wt had virtually no effect on recycling (Fig. 2C). Having established the effectiveness of the truncated construct, we proceeded to assess its effects on SOC activation. Control and SNAP-23CΔ9-expressing COS-1 cells were loaded with the indicator Fura-2 to monitor [Ca2+]cyt by fluorescence ratio microscopy. Activation of the SOC was accomplished by depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores with thapsigargin (TG), a potent inhibitor of the SERCA-type ATPases (30Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Depletion of the stores was initially verified by the transient increase in [Ca2+]cyt elicited by TG in cells bathed in calcium-free medium (Fig. 3A). SNAP-23CΔ9 did not alter this transient, implying that the cells retained the ability to accumulate calcium in the ER as well as their sensitivity to TG (Fig. 3B). Reintroduction of extracellular calcium then elicited a large rise in [Ca2+]cyt, indicative of SOC activation (Fig. 3A). Remarkably, the [Ca2+]cyt response to the readdition of calcium was not different in control and SNAP-23CΔ9-transfected cells. In 19 separate determinations, the activation of SOC was similar in untransfected and in SNAP-23CΔ9-expressing cells (Fig. 3B), under conditions where the recycling of transferrin was obliterated. Indeed, in some of the experiments impairment of transferrin traffic was verified directly in the cells used for [Ca2+]cyt determination. These observations suggest that the SNARE function of SNAP-23 is not required for SOC activation. It was conceivable that the reported effect of BotA on SOC activation could be the result of proteolysis of a second BotA-sensitive target. To reanalyze the mode of action of the toxin, COS-1 cells were transfected with cDNA encoding the light chain of BotA, which is the biologically active moiety. As found in cells transfected with SNAP-23CΔ9, the expression of BotA was without effect on SOC activation (Fig. 3B). In 16 experiments, the normalized ratio of the responses recorded in BotA-transfected and control cells averaged 1.24 ± 0.12 (mean ± S.E.). This observation is at odds with the report of Alderton et al. (20Alderton J.M. Ahmed S.A. Smith L.A. Steinhardt R.A. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), who documented a decrease in SOC activation in HEK 293 cells microinjected with BotA. Although the source of this discrepancy is not apparent, the absence of detectable BotA-sensitive SNAP-25 in HEK 293 cells suggest that the toxin exerted a SNARE-independent effect on SOC. VAMP and the Activation of SOCs—Independent evidence for a role of vesicular fusion in SOC activation was derived from studies of the effects of TeTX on calcium influx (20Alderton J.M. Ahmed S.A. Smith L.A. Steinhardt R.A. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This toxin specifically cleaves members of the VAMP family of R-SNAREs, rendering them incapable of supporting membrane fusion (18Blasi J. Chapman E.R. Link E. Binz T. Yamasaki S. De Camilli P. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. Jahn R. Nature. 1993; 365: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 22Schiavo G. Benfenati F. Poulain B. Rossetto O. Polverino de Laureto P. DasGupta B.R. Montecucco C. Nature. 1992; 359: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). To test the role of VAMPs in SOC activation, we transfected COS-1 cells with the catalytically active light chain of TeTX. As before, the effectiveness of the toxin was assessed measuring transferrin traffic (not illustrated). As shown in Fig. 3B, in 16 separate experiments we found no significant depression of SOC activity in cells expressing TeTX. These included experiments where the inhibition of transferrin recycling was verified in the individual cells used for measurement, prior to Fura-2 loading. Thus, we failed to demonstrate any involvement of VAMP-2 or VAMP-3 in the activation of SOC. NSF and the Activation of SOCs—Because there are multiple, often closely related isoforms of the SNAREs, it is conceivable that their functions may be redundant. In this event, selective cleavage o"

The potential role of protein-tyrosine phosphatase in the regulation of Bcr-Abl signaling was explored. First, expression patterns of tyrosine phosphatases in leukemic cell lines were investigated using degenerate primers for reverse transcription-PCR followed by cloning and sequencing of the cDNA. Distinct patterns of distribution of phosphatase were found in erythroid and myeloid leukemic cell lines. Whereas some phosphatases were ubiquitously expressed, others were limited to specific cell types. Surprisingly, a previously cloned “lymphocyte-specific” phosphatase, Lyp, was frequently detected in a number of myeloid cell lines as well as normal granulocytes and monocytes. Lyp was localized to the cytosol, and overexpression of Lyp caused reduction in the phosphorylation levels of multiple proteins in KCL22 chronic myeloid leukemia blast cells including Cbl, Bcr-Abl, Erk1/2, and CrkL. Co-expression of Lyp and Bcr-Abl in Cos-7 cells resulted in decreased levels of Bcr-Abl, Grb2, and Myc. Overexpression of Lyp markedly suppressed anchorage-independent clonal growth of KCL22 cells. Taken together, the data suggest that Lyp may play an antagonistic role in signaling by the Bcr-Abl fusion protein.

The protein contains three src homology domains, SH1 with tyrosine kinase function, and SH2 and SH3 involved in protein-protein interaction. The enzymatic activity of Abl can be regulated through protein-binding domains and stimulated by growth factors and DNA damage (4Plattner R. Kadlec L. DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A.M.

The aberrant tyrosine phosphorylation levels of Bcr-Abl activate a series of signaling pathways, and a multitude of proteins exhibit a marked increase in their level of phosphorylation including Bcr-Abl itself, CrkL (an adaptor protein), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (9Deininger M.W.

Interaction between Cbl and CrkL is tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent, and the complex has been implicated in Bcr-Abl mediated transformation (14Sattler M. Salgia R. Okuda K. Uemura N.

Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPase) counter the activity of tyrosine kinases by removing phosphate groups from proteins that have been phosphorylated on tyrosyl residues. Whereas protein-tyrosine kinases have been intensely studied over the past decade, the significance of PTPase has just started to be recognized (15Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). PTPases are involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation, as well as cell death (16Fischer E.H. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1999; 39: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Li L. Dixon J.E. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). CD45 is one of the better studied hematopietic PTPases and is a key regulator of lymphocyte functions (18Alexander D.R. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Other hematopoietic PTPases, such as SHP-1, are involved in cytokine receptor signaling (19Kim H. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 18: 5326-5338Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). PTPases display high sequence homology in their catalytic domain (20Andersen J.N. Mortensen O.H. Peters G.H. Drake P.G. Iversen L.F. Olsen O.H. Jansen P.G. Andersen H.S. Tonks N.K. Moller N.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7117-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), which allows the identification of PTPase family members by using degenerate primers in RT-PCR amplification. We have employed this method to investigate the expression pattern of PTPase in leukemic cells. Degenerate PTPase primers were designed and used to amplify different PTPases from RNA isolated from leukemic cell lines. PCR products were cloned, and individual clones were identified by DNA sequencing. Specific PTPase expression patterns were obtained for each cell line. Lyp, a PTPase that was previously shown to be expressed in lymphoid cells (21Cohen S. Dadi H. Shaoul E. Sharfe N. Roifman C.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 2013-2024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was identified in this study as one of the major PTPases in myeloid leukemic cells. Lyp was localized to the cytoplasm in the KCL22 CML cell line. Overexpression of Lyp in KCL22 CML cells caused reduction of total cellular phosphorylation levels of proteins. Of particular interest, phosphorylation of Cbl and Bcr-Abl markedly decreased in these cells, and this was associated with markedly decreased levels of Bcr-Abl. Molecules that are substrates of Bcr-Abl, such as CrkL and Erk1/2, also had a decrease in their phosphorylation levels, and amounts of the Grb2 and Myc proteins decreased. Anchorage-independent clonal growth in soft agar markedly decreased in KCL22 cells overexpressing Lyp. Our study suggests a novel mechanism for Bcr-Abl regulation. Cell Culture, Transfection, and CML Patient Samples—Cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) except for the following: ML-1 cells were a gift from Dr. M. Kastan (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). Kasumi-1 and Kasumi-3 cells were established by Dr. H. Asou (Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan). Adherent and suspension cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and RPMI, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection of KCL22 cells (5 × 107) was performed by electroporation at 340 V with 20 μg of plasmid in RPMI containing 50% fetal calf serum. Transfection of Cos-7 cells was carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) over 4 h according to the manufacturer's protocol. Proteins and RNA were prepared from the bone marrow of CML patients after their informed consent. Reverse Transcription and Polymerase Chain Reaction—Two μg of total RNA isolated with TRIzol reagent was reverse-transcribed with Superscript II and random primers according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). PCR consisted of 22–30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 62–64 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. With degenerate primers, the annealing cycles were modified by starting the annealing process at 37 °C and heating to 72 °C within 2 min. Primers used are: β-actin-specific, 5′-TACATGGCTGGGGTGTTGAA-3′, 5′-AAGAGAGGCATCCTCACCCT-3′; Lyp-specific, 5′-TGGCCTCCAAGTGGTACCAG-3′, 5′-CATCGGCAAGAAAGAAGGAC-3′. Degenerate primers for PTPase were deduced from amino acid sequences: ACKCCNGCNSWRCARTG (upper strand) and AGYGAYTAYATHAAYGC (lower strand). PCR products amplified from degenerate primers were cloned into pBluescript for sequencing. DNA sequences were compared with the NCBI data base using the BLAST program. Separation of Peripheral Blood Cells—Polymorphonuclear cells (neutrophils) were isolated from anticoagulated blood using polymorphonuclear neutrophil solution (Robbins Scientific, Sunnyville, CA) according to the one-step density gradient centrifugation method. Briefly, whole blood was layered over polymorphonuclear neutrophil solution and centrifuged for 25 min at 500 × g. Mononuclear cells and neutrophils were separated into two distinct bands, whereas erythrocytes pelleted to the bottom of the tube. Neutrophils were obtained from the lower band and were washed twice with serum-free medium. Monocytes were separated from the mononuclear cell fraction by adherence to plastic cell culture dishes. CD3+ cells were isolated from the mononuclear fraction by FACStar flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using monoclonal murine antibodies against CD3 conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate and phosphatidylethanolamine, respectively (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Hybridization with an Internal Oligonucleotide—Gel-separated PCR products were blotted onto nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary transfer in 20× SSC. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed at 42 °C in digoxigenin Easy-Hyb solution (Roche Applied Science). The following internal oligonucleotides were used for hybridization probes: Lyp-specific, 5′-AGTCAGCTGTACTAGCAACTGCTC-3′; β-actin-specific: 5′-ATCGAGCACGGCATCGTCAC-3′. These were end-labeled with digoxigenin using the digoxigenin 3′ end labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Signal was detected by incubating with chemiluminescent substrate CDP-Star (Tropix, Bedford, MA) followed by autoradiography. Fluorescent Microscopy—Cells were transfected with Lyp-green fluorescent protein (GFP), fixed at 24 h post-transfection with 2% neutral buffered formaldehyde (2% formaldehyde, 20 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4) in Hanks' balanced salt solution for 15 min at 37 °C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times, and examined under a fluorescent microscope. The fluorescence data that are shown (see Fig. 3) are representative of multiple transfection experiments. Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR—Isolated RNA was reverse-transcribed as described above. Real-time PCR was performed on iCycler thermal cycler (Bio-Rad). PCR reaction contained a total volume of 25 μl and consisted of 5 μl of cDNA, 500 nm of either Lyp or β-actin-specific primer pairs, HotStart TaqDNA polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), 0.25 mm dNTPs, and 1 μl of 1:60,000 SYBRgreen I ® (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Triplicate samples were analyzed for each cDNA. Expression of Lyp was normalized to β-actin expression. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin). For immunoprecipitation, 1 mg of lysate was incubated with anti-abl antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C for 2 h and binding with protein A/G-Sepharose (Calbiochem) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed with lysis buffer and resuspended in the sample buffer before loading onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For blotting, various antibodies were used followed by ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). Soft Agar Colony Assays—Equal numbers of cells (2,000 cells) were plated in 0.3% agar containing 20% fetal bovine serum and RPMI on top of 0.5% agar in 24-well plates. Colony formation was counted and photographed after 2 weeks of culture. Data represent results of triplicate dishes. Distribution of Protein-tyrosine Phosphatase Expression in Myeloid Leukemic Cell Lines—The distribution of PTPase in myeloid cells was assessed by RT-PCR using degenerate PTPase primers and cloning of individual protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Over 371 individual clones were sequenced from three myeloid cell lines, K562, HL-60, and ML-1. The analysis of a large number of PTPase-containing clones should provide a good reflection of the expression pattern of PTPase in human myeloid leukemic cells and may provide the opportunity to identify a unique PTPase. The K562 cells are erythroleukemic cells, the ML-1 cells are early myeloblasts, and the HL-60 cells are late myeloblasts. CD45 was the most prominently expressed PTPase, representing 29, 46, and 57% of the clones isolated from K562, HL-60, and ML-1, respectively (Table I). In K562 cells, both CD45 and the PTPase PEST were equally abundant with both being expressed in the same number of clones (41 of a total of 140). PEST was the second most prominent PTPase in ML-1 cells (22%). In total, between 8 and 12 different PTPases were identified per cell line with HL-60 myeloblasts showing the greatest diversity in expression (12 different PTPases). Each cell line displayed a distinct set of PTPases. PTPπ, PTPN9, LCPTP, and PTP-1B could only be identified in K562 cells. PTYPH, PTPRF, and PTPRO were only found in HL-60 cells. PTPN7 and PTPD1 were only identified in ML-1 cells, whereas CD45, PEST, and Lyp were present in all three cell lines.Table IDistribution of phosphatase expression in myeloid leukemic cell linesPhosphataseK562HL-60ML-1nan represents number of clones.

Open table in a new tab Expression Pattern of Lyp—Lyp has recently been described as a lymphoid-specific PTPase (21Cohen S. Dadi H. Shaoul E. Sharfe N. Roifman C.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 2013-2024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); thus, we were surprised to find it to be one of the more frequently expressed PTPases in the three myeloid cell lines used in this study (Table I, Fig. 1). Lyp represented 30% of the PTPase-containing clones in HL-60 cells and 10–12% of clones in K562 and ML-1 cells. Therefore, we studied Lyp expression in a panel of human leukemic cell lines as well as in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes using semiquantitative RT-PCR with Lyp-specific primers. In the myeloid cell lines, we observed high levels of Lyp mRNA in KG-1 (very early myeloblasts), HL-60 and ML-1 (myeloblasts), U937 (myelomonoblasts), as well as SK-NO1 and KCL22 (CML blasts) (Fig. 1). The expression was comparable with that seen in the Jurkat T-cell line (Fig. 1). In contrast, Lyp was less robustly expressed in THP-1 (monoblasts), K562 (erythroblasts), Kasumi-1 (mature myeloblasts expressing the AML1-ETO fusion protein), and Kasumi-3 (very early myeloblasts) cells (Fig. 1). We also analyzed a series of colon cancer cell lines and found very low or undetectectable expression of Lyp (data not shown). Next, we isolated different types of normal human peripheral white blood cells to analyze Lyp expression. We found that Lyp was expressed at a higher level in neutrophils and monocytes as compared with CD3+ T lymphocytes (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Expression of Lyp in peripheral blood white cells. Subpopulations of human peripheral white blood cells were separated and analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR using either β-actin- or Lyp-specific primers.

The Cos-7 and KCL22 CML myeloid blast cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector of Lyp fused to GFP and examined by fluorescence microscopy 48 h after transfection. We found that Lyp was predominantly cytoplasmic (Fig. 3). Role of Lyp in Myeloid Cells—The Lyp phosphatase has previously been shown to interact with and regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl in T lymphocytes (21Cohen S. Dadi H. Shaoul E. Sharfe N. Roifman C.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 2013-2024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cbl itself has been demonstrated to be a target for tyrosine phosphorylation by the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase (22de Jong R. ten Hoeve J. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21468-21471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, we were interested to determine whether Lyp might have a role in Bcr-Abl-expressing CML cells, such as KCL22. Human Lyp cDNA was inserted into a Zn2+-inducible vector, and the resulting Lyp expression vector (pMT-Lyp) and the empty vector (pMT-neo) were transfected separately into KCL22 cells. Stable cell lines were isolated by G418 selection. The induction of Lyp was measured by quantitative real-time PCR for up to 4 days of exposure to ZnSO4. We found a 3-fold induction of Lyp mRNA when comparing KCL22 stably transfected with pMT-Lyp to the empty pMT vector alone after 2 and 3 days of zinc induction (Fig. 4A). Only after 4 days in the presence of zinc did we observe more than 8–10-fold of Lyp mRNA induction. Total cellular proteins were isolated from 2 and 4 days of zinc induction, and the total cell lysates were analyzed for Lyp protein expression by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 4B). Because Bcr-Abl is a major protein involved in the transforming phenotype of KCL22, we looked at the Bcr-Abl protein levels in these Lyp-overexpressing cells. We found that after 4 days of zinc exposure, Bcr-Abl protein level is decreased by more than 10-fold (Fig. 4B). Since Lyp dephosphorylates tyrosine residues, we first probed a Western blot from the protein lysates with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody to determine whether overexpression of Lyp affected the overall level of tyrosine phosphorylation as compared with the control cells. We observed a decrease in the level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation upon Lyp overexpression (Fig. 5A). Of particular interest was the marked reduction of tyrosine phosphorylation for proteins of 120 and 210 kDa (Fig. 5A). We proposed that these proteins were most likely Cbl and Bcr-Abl, respectively, based on their molecular sizes. Therefore, the Western immunoblot was reprobed with antibodies against these two proteins, which confirmed that the proteins at 120 and 210 kDa were indeed Cbl and Bcr-Abl (Fig. 5, B and C). A comparison of the Lyp-overexpressing KCL22 versus control KCL22 cells showed that the overall amount of Cbl protein was unaffected by the induction of Lyp (Fig. 5B). However, when the immunoblot was reprobed with an antibody against Abl, we observed that overexpression of Lyp resulted in a decrease in Bcr-Abl protein expression (Fig. 5C), similar to what was observed above (Fig. 4B). We also examined the expression of Lyp protein in the leukemic cells from patients with CML. CML has a chronic phase, a short accelerated phase, evolving into the short-lived blast crisis. Lyp was expressed in these samples at various levels, and no correlation was noted between the amount of expression of Lyp protein and stage of the CML (Fig. 6A). Similar observations were made when looking at Lyp RNA levels in CML patients by real-time PCR, although the number of cases was small (Fig. 6B). To investigate further the role of Lyp in the regulation of Bcr-Abl, we transiently co-transfected Cos-7 cells with an expression vector for Bcr-Abl and either Lyp-GFP or GFP alone. Total cellular proteins were isolated and analyzed by Western immunoblots. The use of an anti-GFP antibody and Lyp antiserum demonstrated the expression of the Lyp phosphatase in these cells co-transfected with Lyp-GFP and Bcr-Abl (Fig. 7, A and B). Negligible Bcr-Abl could be detected from the Cos-7 cells co-transfected with Bcr-Abl and the Lyp-GFP (Fig. 7C). GAPDH immunoblotting demonstrated that equal amounts of protein lysates were used (Fig. 7D). These results suggest that the expression of Lyp causes a decrease in Bcr-Abl protein expression, presumably via regulating its degradation. Activation of the Ras signaling pathway by Bcr-Abl involves a series of molecular events including direct interaction between the adaptor protein Grb2 and the phosphorylated Bcr-Abl (23Pendergast A.M. Quilliam L.A. Cripe L.D. Bassin C.H. Dai Z. Li N. Batzer A. Rabun K.M. Der C.J. Schlessinger J. Gishizky M.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 175-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), induction of Myc protein (24Cortez D. Kadlec L. Pendergast A.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 5531-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of CrkL and Erk1/2. We found that when Lyp was expressed, levels of Bcr-Abl and Grb2 markedly decreased, and a slight reduction of Myc protein levels was observed (Fig. 7E). Also, a prominent decrease of CrkL and Erk1/2 phosphorylation occurred in these Lyp-expressing cells (Fig. 8). The effect of Lyp overexpression on anchorage-independent clonal growth in soft agar of KCL22 CML cells was investigated. KCL22 pMT-neo formed robust colonies in soft agar (Fig. 9). In comparison, KCL22 pMT-Lyp cells had markedly decreased clonal growth, both in number and size of the colonies, suggesting that overexpression of Lyp inhibited the transforming potential of KCL22 CML cells (Fig. 9). In this study, we identified a number of PTPases in three human myeloid leukemic cell lines. Of these, CD45, PEST, and Lyp were the most prevalent. CD45, also known as the leukocyte common antigen, is an integral membrane protein expressed on all nucleated hematopoietic cells (25Streuli M. Hall L.R. Saga Y. Schlossman S.F. Saito H. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1548-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 26Sasaki T. Sasaki-Irie J. Penninger J.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 1041-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It regulates the activity of the Src family of kinases (27Ishikawa H. Tsuyama N. Abroun S. Liu S. Li F.J. Taniguchi O. Kawano M.M. Blood. 2002; 99: 2172-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Since CD45 has been shown to be expressed on all hematopoietic lineages and stages of development, we were not surprised that it was the predominant PTPase detected in our study. PEST, a major PTPase identified in K562 cells, has been described as an important regulator of cell migration (28Garton A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3811-3818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and has been suggested to have a role in leukemia through an interaction with paxillin (29Shen Y. Lyons P. Cooley M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1405-1413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The third major PTPase detected in the myeloid cells was Lyp. Previously, Lyp was identified as a lymphocyte-specific PTPase (21Cohen S. Dadi H. Shaoul E. Sharfe N. Roifman C.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 2013-2024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that Lyp represented 31% of the 155 clones obtained from the late myeloblast HL-60 cells, and a substantial amount of Lyp expression was found in several myeloid cell lines including myelomonoblastic U937 cells and the very early myeloblastic KG-1 cells. Expression of Lyp can also be found in peripheral blood granulocytes and monocytes, suggesting a potential function of Lyp in myeloid cell development. Lyp has cytoplasmic expression and some perinuclear staining in Jurkat cells (21Cohen S. Dadi H. Shaoul E. Sharfe N. Roifman C.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 2013-2024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We showed in KCL22 CML cells that Lyp is localized to the cytoplasm, where it may interact with Bcr-Abl and play a role in regulating the signaling of this transforming fusion protein. We found that overexpression of Lyp resulted in a decrease in the expression of Bcr-Abl as well as a reduction in the phosphorylation levels of Cbl. The decrease in Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation is probably the result of Lyp phosphatase activity independent of Bcr-Abl function since Cbl has been shown to be a target of Lyp activity in T cells not containing Bcr-Abl (21Cohen S. Dadi H. Shaoul E. Sharfe N. Roifman C.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 2013-2024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In T cells, Lyp regulates T cell receptor signaling by associating with and dephosphorylating Cbl. Alternatively, Cbl is a substrate of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, and down-regulation of Bcr-Abl would cause a reduction in the level of Cbl phosphorylation. CML is caused in part by activation of various signaling pathways by the aberrant tyrosine kinase activity of the Bcr-Abl fusion protein. This active tyrosine kinase phosphorylates a number of signaling proteins, including STAT5, SHC, Cbl, Grb2, paxillin, and CrkL. The interaction of Bcr-Abl with Cbl probably causes activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway (14Sattler M. Salgia R. Okuda K. Uemura N. Durstin M.A. Pisick E. Xu G. Li J.L. Prasad K.V. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 839-846PubMed Google Scholar), and interaction between Bcr-Abl with Grb2 can lead to the activation of Ras signaling. Stimulation of both of these pathways is important for Bcr-Abl-induced transformation. Either a dominant-negative form of Grb2 (30Gishizky M.L. Cortez D. Pendergast A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10889-10893Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or Bcr-Abl with mutation in the Grb2-binding SH2 domain can suppress Bcr-Abl transformation (31Goga A. McLaughlin J. Afar D.E. Saffran D.C. Witte O.N. Cell. 1995; 82: 981-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and leukemogenesis (32Million R.P. Etten R.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 664-670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, Lyp has also been shown to interact with the adaptor molecule Grb2 (33Hill R.J. Zozulya S. Lu Y.L. Ward K. Gishizky M. Jallal B. Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 237-2344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this instance, wild-type Lyp, but not a catalytically inactive Lyp, had a negative regulatory role in T cell signaling via regulation of interactions of Grb2 with the T cell receptor. In KCL22 CML cells, lower Grb2 expression levels were found when Lyp was overexpressed. The SH3 domain of Grb2 interacts with Sos (the guanine nucleotide releasing factor son of sevenless) and stimulates Ras and the MAPK kinase pathways. Inhibition of CML blast cell proliferation can be induced by disruption of Grb2-Sos complexes (34Kardinal C. Konkol B. Lin H. Eulitz M. Schmidt E.K. Estrov Z. Talpaz M. Arlinghaus R.B. Feller S.M. Blood. 2001; 98: 1773-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Potentially, the degradation of Grb2 can be a direct effect of overexpression of Lyp, and disruption of the Grb2-Sos complex leads to inactivation of Erk1/2 and consequently contributes to the loss of the transforming potential of KCL22 cells in the soft agar assay. Decreased phosphorylation of CrkL may partially contribute to the loss of transforming potential of Lyp-overexpressing cells. Multiple tyrosine residues are phosphorylated in CrkL when activated by Bcr-Abl, and mutations or deletions in CrkL diminish cell transformation and adhesion in both fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells (35Senechal K. Heaney C. Druker B. Sawyers C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5082-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To date, a major focus of basic CML research has focused on the aberrant tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr-Abl and the consequences of tyrosine phosphorylation. However, intracellular levels of tyrosine phosphorylation are controlled by the opposing actions of kinases and phosphatases. Bcr-Abl can interact with and regulate phosphatases. In some instances, Bcr-Abl phosphorylates these phosphatases, and subsequently, these phosphatases can dephosphorylate Bcr-Abl, resulting in a decrease in Bcr-Abl kinase activity (36LaMontagne Jr., K.R. Hannon G. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14094-14099Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For example, Bcr-Abl up-regulates the expression of PTP-1B PTPase, which in turn dephosphorylates Bcr-Abl, resulting in the inhibition of Grb2 binding and suppression of Ras activity (37LaMontagne Jr., K.R. Flint A.J. Franza Jr., B.R. Pandergast A.M. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2965-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Bcr-Abl has been shown to interact with and to regulate the expression of SHIP, an SH2-containing inositol phosphatase that regulates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway (38Tauchi T. Feng G.S. Shen R. Song H.Y. Donner D. Pawson T. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15381-15387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bcr-Abl can directly inhibit the expression of SHIP phosphatase by down-regulating the amount of mRNA as well as decreasing the half-life of the protein (39Sattler M. Salgia R. Shrikhande G. Verma S. Choi J.L. Rohrschneider L.R. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2379-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Since SHIP down-regulates the activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway, direct control of this negative regulator by Bcr-Abl can result in increased myeloid proliferation, as was observed in SHIP–/– mice (40Liu Q. Sasaki T. Kozieradzki I. Wakeham A. Itie A. Dumont D.J. Penninger J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In previous studies that showed an interaction of a phosphatase such as PTP1B with Bcr-Abl, the Bcr-Abl kinase activity decreased, but no change occurred in the overall expression of the fusion protein (36LaMontagne Jr., K.R. Hannon G. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14094-14099Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 37LaMontagne Jr., K.R. Flint A.J. Franza Jr., B.R. Pandergast A.M. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2965-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our study is, to our knowledge, the first description of a phosphatase regulating Bcr-Abl signaling via alteration of the levels of Bcr-Abl protein. The mechanism by which this occurs has yet to be determined. We attempted experiments to determine whether Bcr-Abl was ubiquitinated by Lyp. The results of these experiments showed that Bcr-Abl was not ubiquitinated by co-expression of Lyp (data not shown). In K562 cells, the molecular chaperone Hsp90 forms a complex with Bcr-Abl, extending the half-life of Bcr-Abl (41An W.G. Schulte T.W. Neckers L.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 2000; 11: 355-360PubMed Google Scholar). By interfering with the function of Hsp90, geldanamycin or its analog 17-allyamnogeldanamycin can induce Bcr-Abl protein degradation (41An W.G. Schulte T.W. Neckers L.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 2000; 11: 355-360PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps overexpression of Lyp disrupts the association between the Hsp90 and Bcr-Abl complex and promotes Bcr-Abl degradation. In conclusion, we showed that Lyp is expressed in the myeloid cell lineage, and Lyp overexpression in KCL22 cells induces Bcr-Abl and Grb2 degradation, as well as dephosphorylation of Cbl, CrkL, and Erk1/2. Overexpression of Lyp inhibits transforming potential of KCL22 cells. Our data suggest that Lyp may behave as a tumor suppressor."

These two residues are located four amino acids apart at the extracellular end of transmembrane segment 7 in a region of GAT-1 that we have previously suggested undergoes conformational changes critical for the transport process. The two single mutants and the double mutant (M345H/T349H) were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and their steady-state and presteady-state kinetics were examined and compared with wild type GAT-1 by using the two-electrode voltage clamp method. Oocytes expressing M345H showed a decrease in apparent GABA affinity, an increase in apparent affinity for Na+, a shift in the charge/voltage (Q/V m) relationship to more positive membrane potentials, and an increased Li+-induced leak current. Oocytes expressing T349H showed an increase in apparent GABA affinity, a decrease in apparent Na+ affinity, a profound shift in the Q/V m relationship to more negative potentials, and a decreased Li+-induced leak current. The data are consistent with a shift in the conformational equilibrium of the mutant transporters, with M345H stabilized in an outward-facing conformation and T349H in an inward-facing conformation.

These transporters are involved in re-uptake of the neurotransmitter at the synaptic terminals and thereby contribute to termination of the neuronal response. The transport proteins are predicted to contain 12 transmembrane domains (TMs) (1Guastella J. Nelson N. Nelson H. Czyzyk L. Keynan S. Miedel M.C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kanner B.I.

It is a general assumption that the Na+/Cl–-dependent transporters operate by an alternating access mechanism, where the transporter interchanges between a series of “outward-facing” conformations, in which the substrate binding sites are accessible to the extracellular medium, and a series of “inward-facing” conformations, in which the binding sites are accessible to the intracellular environment. However, relatively little is known about the conformational changes associated with the binding and translocation of GABA, Na+, and Cl– (19Golovanevsky V. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Previously, we have obtained evidence in both GAT-1 (14MacAulay N. Bendahan A. Loland C.J. Kanner B.I. Zeuthen T. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40476-40485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and the homologous dopamine transporter, DAT (29Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15836-15846Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), that the external ends of TM 7 and 8 undergo conformational changes that are critical for the translocation process. This conclusion was based on the observation that binding of Zn2+ to bidentate Zn2+ binding sites engineered between TM 7 and 8 in both GAT-1 and DAT results in potent non-competitive inhibition of substrate transport. This is consistent with the ability of Zn2+ to restrain movements between the two helices and/or of the connecting fourth extracellular loop. In this study we have investigated two mutants in the GAT-1 situated only four residues apart at the external end of TM 7. The residues were initially mutated during our attempt to transfer engineered Zn2+ binding sites from the dopamine transporter to GAT-1. Contrary to DAT (31Norregaard L. Visiers I. Loland C.J. Ballesteros J. Weinstein H. Gether U. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15836-15846Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the combined mutation of the two residues Met345 and Thr349 to histidines did not result in Zn2+ sensitivity of GAT-1 (data not shown). Instead, we show here that the individual mutation of these two residues results in characteristic and distinct phenotypes that are consistent with oppositely directed shifts in the conformational equilibrium. It is therefore proposed that the TM 7/8 microdomain in this class of transporters not only may undergo conformational changes during the transport process but also may play a role in maintaining an appropriate conformational equilibrium of the transporter, possibly through intramolecular interactions. Molecular Biology and Oocytes—The rat GAT-1 cDNA was mutated by PCR-derived site-directed mutagenesis and cloned into a vector optimized for oocyte expression (pNB1) as earlier described (14MacAulay N. Bendahan A. Loland C.J. Kanner B.I. Zeuthen T. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40476-40485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cDNA was linearized downstream of the poly(A) segment and in vitro transcribed with the T7 RNA polymerase using the mCAP mRNA capping kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and 50 ng cRNA was injected into defolliculated X. laevis oocytes (14MacAulay N.

The oocytes were incubated in Kulori medium (90 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1mm MgCl2, 5mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at 19 °C for 3–7 days before experiments were performed. Electrophysiology—The two-electrode voltage clamp method was used to control the membrane potential and monitor the current in oocytes expressing WT and mutant transporters, as earlier described (14MacAulay N. Bendahan A. Loland C.J. Kanner B.I. Zeuthen T. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40476-40485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Generally, the membrane potential (V m) of the oocyte was held at –50 mV, and the experimental chamber was continuously perfused by a NaCl solution containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. In Na+ substitution experiments, Na+ was replaced by equimolar choline ions, and in the leak current experiments equimolar Li+ replaced Na+. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed at room temperature with a Dagan Clampator interfaced to an IBM-compatible PC using a DigiData 1200 A/D converter and pCLAMP 6.0/8.0 (Axon Instruments). Currents were low pass-filtered at 500 Hz and sampled at 2 kHz. Electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries to a resistance of 0.5–2 megaohm and filled with 1 m KCl. The transporter-specific GABA-induced current (I GABA) was obtained by subtracting the current in NaCl solution from the current in NaCl solution + GABA (I Na + GABA – I Na), whereas the leak current was obtained by subtracting the current in ChCl solution (100 mm ChCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) from the current in LiCl solution (I Li – I Ch). For steady-state kinetic analysis, the I GABA was measured at various membrane potentials and external substrate concentrations ([S]), and at each voltage, the I GABA versus the [S] relations were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation, I = (I max × [S])/([S] + (K 0.5)), where [S] is the substrate concentration, I max is the maximal current for saturating [S], and K 0.5 is the apparent affinity constant. The apparent GABA affinity was determined at 100 mm external Na+ by varying the GABA concentration, and Na+ activation was determined at a fixed (saturating) GABA concentration by varying the external Na+ concentration. For determination of the presteady-state transient currents, a pulse protocol was used where V m initially was held at –40 mV and then jumped to a series of test potentials (from +40 to –160 mV with 20-mV increments) for 500 ms before returning to V m. At each test potential, the transporter-specific presteady-state transient currents (I Na – I Ch) were obtained by subtraction of the current traces in ChCl solution from those obtained in NaCl solution. The charge movement, Q, was obtained by integrating the ON transient currents at different potentials with respect to time. The charge-voltage (Q/V m) relations were fitted to a Boltzmann function, Q – Q hyp/Q max = 1/[1 + exp(z(V t – V 0.5)F/RT)], where Q max = Q dep – Q hyp (Q dep and Q hyp are the Q at depolarizing and hyperpolarizing limits), F is the Faraday constant, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, V 0.5 is the membrane potential where there is 50% charge transfer, and z is the apparent valence of the movable charge (32Loo D.D.F. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The time constants, τ, were obtained by fitting the current traces to the equation I tot(t) = I 1 × exp(τ1 × t) + I 2 × exp(τ2 × t) + I ss, where I tot is the total current, I 1 is the transporter-specific current, I 2 is the capacitative current, I ss is the steady-state current, and t is the time. [3H]GABA Uptake Experiments in Oocytes—The uptake experiments were performed in 24-well plates with 100 μm GABA (RBI, Natick, MA) and 50 nm 4-amino-n-[2,3-3H]butyric acid ([3H]GABA), 88 Ci/mmol (Amersham Biosciences) added to a total of 400 μl of uptake buffer (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Oocytes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, washed 3 times with 1 ml of wash buffer with choline chloride (100 mm ChCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and dissolved in 200 μl of 10% SDS. Before counting, 2 ml of scintillation fluid (Opti-fluor, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to the samples. Calculations—The data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), Clampfit (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA), and SigmaPlot (Version 6.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). All numbers are given as means ± S.E., with n equal to the number of oocytes tested. The current range of the oocytes expressing the various constructs was taken as a measure of the range in expression level and is stated in the figure legends and in the table. GABA Affinity and pH Dependence—Met345 and Thr349, located at the extracellular end of TM 7 in GAT-1, were individually and together mutated to histidines, resulting in the mutants M345H, T349H, and M345H/T349H. All three mutants were functional as assessed upon expression in X. laevis oocytes and subsequent uptake experiments and two-electrode voltage clamp analysis. The apparent GABA affinity (K 0.5) was significantly altered by the histidine mutations (Fig. 1, filled symbols). In the T349H mutation, the K 0.5 decreased from 22 ± 4 μm in the WT (n = 7) to 4 ± 1 μm (n = 5) at a membrane potential of –60 mV, whereas M345H displayed a reduced apparent affinity as reflected in a K 0.5 value of 220 ± 16 μm (n = 5). The double mutant T349H/M345H showed an apparent affinity intermediate of the two single mutations (K 0.5 = 45 ± 3 μm, n = 5). Contrary to M345H and T349H/M345H, the K 0.5 values of the WT and T349H were voltage-dependent, i.e. the apparent GABA affinity decreased upon hyperpolarization. The effect of histidine substitutions were compared with substitutions with an alanine and a cysteine in position 345 and a cysteine in position 349. The effects of these substitutions were less pronounced and are, therefore, not dealt with in detail; M345C showed slightly reduced apparent GABA affinity at V m = –60 mV (∼2-fold change as opposed to the ∼10-fold in M345H, data not shown), whereas the apparent affinity of M345A was in between that of the WT and the M345H (∼6-fold change, data not shown). The apparent GABA affinity of the T349C mutant transporter was slightly decreased compared with that of the WT (∼2-fold change), which was exactly the opposite effect of the T349H (data not shown). From the I/V plots in Fig. 2 (filled symbols), it is apparent that the voltage dependence of the GABA-induced current was changed in the mutant transporters; T349H showed increased voltage dependence compared with the WT, as seen from the steep slope in the I/V relation. The current does not saturate at the clamp potentials employed in these experiments, and very little current is seen at potentials more depolarized than –100 mV. In contrast, M345H and M345H/T349H displayed less voltage dependence than the WT. This is indicated by the early saturation of the I/V relation as the membrane potential of the oocytes is increasingly hyperpolarized and by the presence of a substrate-induced current even at 0 mV, especially for M345H. We analyzed the effect of lowering the pH from 7.4 to 5.5 (open symbols in Figs. 1 and 2). Such a pH change would be expected to cause protonation of the inserted histidines and thereby introduce a positive charge. In the WT we observed no change in the voltage-dependent apparent GABA affinity upon lowering the pH (Fig. 1), and the magnitude of the current and the shape of the I/V-relation in the presence of saturating GABA concentration was not affected at the potentials tested. For example, at a membrane potential of –150 mV the current at pH 5.5 was 109 ± 3% compared with that seen in the control solution of pH 7.4, n = 5 (Fig. 2). This is in agreement with previous studies (10Forlani G. Bossi E. Ghirardelli R. Giovannardi S. Binda F. Bonadiman L. Ielmini L. Peres A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 479-494Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the mutants, however, we found a different pattern. For M345H, the reduced pH caused an increase in the apparent affinity for GABA (Fig. 1), which was completely voltage-insensitive at pH 5.5 as well as at pH 7.4. The K 0.5 for GABA was pH-dependent in both T349H and M345H/T349H. In T349H at pH 5.5, the K 0.5 was increased at hyperpolarized potentials compared with pH 7.4. Oppositely, the K 0.5(GABA) at pH 5.5 in M345H/T349H decreased at depolarized potentials and also became voltage-dependent. For all three mutant transporters the magnitude of the GABA-induced currents was markedly increased at pH 5.5 (open symbols in Fig. 2). At a membrane potential of –150 mV the current for M345H at pH 5.5 was 148 ± 6% (n = 5) of that found at pH 7.4 and 157 ± 18% (n = 4) for T349H. An even larger effect was observed in the double mutant (258 ± 20% of the current obtained at pH 7.4, n = 5), suggesting an additive effect on the transport-associated current upon protonation of both M345H and T349H. This increase in GABA-induced current at lower pH did not reflect an increase in an uncoupled transport-associated current as shown by uptake experiments with [3H]GABA. The [3H]GABA uptake of WT was reduced to 90 ± 3% at pH 5.5 compared with that at pH 7.4 (n = 4), whereas the [3H]GABA uptake of M345H/T349H was 128 ± 5 (n = 5), p < 0.001, Student's t test. The uptake experiments were performed under unclamped conditions, in which the membrane potential approaches the reversal potential of the transporter; therefore, the numbers are not directly comparable with those above, in which the GABA-induced current was measured under voltage clamp (–150 mV). As seen From Fig. 2, the percentage increase in GABA-induced current at low pH increases with more negative clamp potentials. At a membrane potential of –20 mV (which is a feasible membrane potential during an uptake experiment), the pH-induced increase in current is comparable with that obtained in the uptake experiments. Na + Affinity—The Na+ activation curves performed at –120 mV for the WT, M345H, T349H, and M345H/T349H are shown in Fig. 3, and the K 0.5 values obtained at different membrane potentials (V ms) are summarized in Table I. The apparent Na+ affinity for the WT was 44 ± 6 mm (n = 5) and was highly voltage-dependent, in agreement with previous studies (Table I and Refs. 15MacAulay N. Zeuthen T. Gether U. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 544: 447-458Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar and 16Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labrace C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the apparent Na+ affinity of the two individual mutants (M345H and T349H) were affected in opposite directions. In T349H the apparent affinity was reduced compared with the WT (K 0.5 = 200 ± 64 mm at –120 mV, n = 4) and showed an even more pronounced voltage dependence. In contrast, M345H displayed increased apparent Na+ affinity (K 0.5 = 6 ± 1 mm, n = 4). Similarly, the double mutant M345H/T349H displayed increased apparent affinity for Na+ (K 0.5 = 6 ± 1 mm, n = 4). Note that the Na+ activation curve for the GABA-induced current in both the WT and the T349H mutant did not show saturation at potentials more depolarized than –80 and –120 mV, respectively, and could therefore not be fitted by the Michaelis-Menten equation. This indicates a strong voltage dependence of the Na+ binding and/or the associated conformational changes. On the contrary, the apparent Na+ affinity of the M345H and T349H/M345H transporters barely showed voltage dependence within our range of measurements (Table I).Table IApparent Na+ affinities for GAT-1 and the mutant constructsI (GABA) (-50 mV)K 0.5(Na) at different clamp potentials-60 mV-80 mV-100 mV-120 mV-140 mV-160 mVnAmM ± S.E.WT180-300NA (5)220 ± 145 (5)87 ± 17 (5)44 ± 6 (5)24 ± 2 (5)15 ± 1 (5)M345H190-60021 ± 6 (4)13 ± 3 (4)8 ± 2 (4)6 ± 1 (4)4 ± 1 (4)4 ± 0 (4)T349H50-85NA (4)NA (4)NA (4)200 ± 64 (4)64 ± 12 (4)31 ± 8 (4)M345H+T349H110-15034 ± 9 (4)18 ± 3 (4)9 ± 2 (4)6 ± 1 (4)5 ± 1 (4)3 ± 1 (4) Open table in a new tab Transient Currents—The GAT-1 and related transporters give rise to substrate-independent capacitive transient currents upon shifts in the membrane potential (10Forlani G.

These currents are thought to arise from conformational changes associated with Na+ binding and dissociation and may, therefore, be used as a functional read-out of the partial reactions of the transport cycle involving these steps. To perform these experiments, the membrane potential was held at –40 mV and jumped to the test potentials (from 40 mV to –160 mV with intervals of 20 mV) for 500 ms and returned to the holding potential for another 500 ms before the next test potential was applied (Fig. 4, upper panels). Because these currents are generally entirely capacitive (16Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labrace C. Davidson N. Lester H.A.

The Q/V m relationships shown in the lower panel of Fig. 4 were obtained from the ON currents for WT, M345H, T349H, and M345H/T349H. The V 0.5 for the WT transporter was –36 ± 2mV(n = 5), which is in agreement with previously published data (10Forlani G. Bossi E. Ghirardelli R. Giovannardi S. Binda F. Bonadiman L. Ielmini L.

Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The Q/V m relationship was shifted markedly toward more negative membrane potentials in T349H, as reflected by a V 0.5 of –85 ± 7 mV, n = 5, whereas it was shifted toward more positive potentials in M345H (V 0.5 = 17 ± 3 mV, n = 6). The V 0.5 of the double mutant (M345H/T349H) was in between that of the two single mutants (V 0.5 = –10 ± 6 mV, n = 5). The time constants (τ) for the relaxation of the ON currents were also examined. For the WT transporter, the τmax was 98 ± 5 ms (n = 4), which is in accordance with previously reported values (7Bossi E. Giovannardi S. Binda F. Forlani G. Peres A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 541: 343-350Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 10Forlani G. Bossi E. Ghirardelli R. Giovannardi S. Binda F. Bonadiman L. Ielmini L. Peres A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 479-494Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This time constant was increased significantly in T349H (230 ± 17 ms, n = 5, p < 0.001, Student's t test). We also observed an apparent, although not significant, increase in τmax for M345H and M345H/T349H (158 ± 23 ms (n = 6) and 132 ± 15 ms (n = 5), respectively). Leak Current—The GAT-1 sustains substrate-independent leak currents at hyperpolarized potentials in the presence of Li+ (6Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5405-5414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As seen from Fig. 5, upper panel, the clamp potential at which the leak current commences differed for the WT and the mutants. The T349H mutant required increased hyperpolarization (compared with that of the WT) in order for the leak conductance to initiate, whereas the M345H mutant supported leak current at a more depolarized potential than the WT. The double mutant (M345H/T349H) behaved more or less like the WT with the requirement of an intermediate hyperpolarization. A remarkable feature of the M345H/T349H mutant was the significantly increased ratio between the magnitude of the leak current and the GABA-induced current: 6.7 ± 0.6 for M345H/T349H compared with 2.3 ± 0.1 for the WT (at V m = –150 mV), n = 5.

Although K+ channel pore-blocking toxins show specific interactions with permeant ions and strong dependence on the ionic strength (μ), no such dependence has been reported for μ-CTX and Na+ channels. Such properties would offer insight into the binding and blocking mechanism of μ-CTX as well as functional and structural properties of the Na+ channel pore. Here we studied the effects of μ and permeant ion concentration ([Na+]) on μ-CTX block of rat skeletal muscle (μ1, Nav1.4) Na+ channels. μ-CTX sensitivity of wild-type and E758Q channels increased significantly (by ∼20-fold) when μ was lowered by substituting external Na+ with equimolar sucrose (from 140 to 35 mm Na+); however, toxin block was unaltered (p > 0.05) when μ was maintained by replacement of [Na+] with N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMG+), suggesting that the enhanced sensitivity at low μ was not due to reduction in [Na+]. Single-channel recordings identified the association rate constant, k on, as the primary determinant of the changes in affinity (k on increased 40- and 333-fold for μ-CTX D2N/R13Q and D12N/R13Q, respectively, when symmetric 200 mm Na+ was reduced to 50 mm). In contrast, dissociation rates changed <2-fold for the same derivatives under the same conditions. Experiments with additional μ-CTX derivatives identified toxin residues Arg-1, Arg-13, and Lys-16 as important contributors to the sensitivity to external μ. Taken together, our findings indicate that μ-CTX block of Na+ channels depends critically on μ but not specifically on [Na+], contrasting with the known behavior of pore-blocking K+ channel toxins. These findings suggest that different degrees of ion interaction, underlying the fundamental conduction mechanisms of Na+ and K+ channels, are mirrored in ion interactions with pore-blocking toxins. μ-Conotoxins (μ-CTXs) are Na+ channel-blocking, 22-amino acid peptides produced by the sea snail Conus geographus.

Although the steric components of interactions are closely related to the pore and toxin geometries and thus are relatively short range, electrostatic interactions are longer range and should depend not only on the immediate ionic environment but also the proximity of complementary, interacting charges. Indeed, K+ channel pore-blocking toxins such as agitoxin and charybdotoxin (ChTX) are known to block their target pores with strong dependence on both the ionic strength and the permeant ion concentration (18Anderson C.S.

However, the importance of these factors for Na+ channel block by μ-CTX has not been systematically explored. Does μ-CTX block the Na+ channel pore with comparable ion dependence as do its K+ channel pore-blocking counterparts? What are the molecular bases underlying such similarities (or differences) in the biological actions of these Na+ and K+ channel pore-blocking toxins? Answers to these questions will not only provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the activities of these specific toxin blockers but also, by inference, into the functional and structural properties of ion channel pores.We studied the effects of Na+ concentration ([Na+]) and ionic strength (μ) on μ-CTX block of toxin-sensitive rat skeletal muscle (μ1 or Nav1.4) Na+ channels. Unlike the action of K+ channel toxins, we found that μ-CTX block of Na+ channels depends on ionic strength but not specifically on the Na+ concentration. Using synthetic μ-CTX derivatives, we further identified toxin residues Arg-1, Arg-13 and Lys-18 as particularly important effectors of the dependence on ionic strength. These results offer novel insights into the mechanism by which μ-CTX interacts with the Na+ channel pore. A preliminary report of this work has appeared previously (24Li R.A. Henrikson C. French R.J.

Mutagenesis was performed in pGFP-IRES using PCR with overlapping mutagenic primers. All mutations were made in duplicate and confirmed by sequencing. Na+ channel constructs were transfected into tsA-201 cells (26Margolskee R. McHendry-Rinde B. Horn R. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 906-911PubMed Google Scholar), which constitutively express t-antigen to boost the level of channel expression, using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Briefly, peptides were synthesized using N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl chemistry and were high-performance liquid chromatography-purified. Peptide composition was verified by quantitative amino acid analysis and/or mass spectroscopy. One-dimensional proton NMR spectra of a number of synthesized toxins were compared with those of the native toxin to test for proper folding.Electrophysiology—Macroscopic currents were recorded using the whole-cell patch clamp technique (27Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15093) Google Scholar) at room temperature. Transfected cells were identified by their green epifluorescence. Pipette electrodes had final tip resistances of 1–3 MΩ. The bath solution contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, with pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Designated concentrations of toxin were added to the bath as indicated. External NaCl was substituted by either sucrose or N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMG) as noted. Osmolalities (in mosmol-kg–1 H2O) of the solutions were: 140 Na, 313; 70 Na/105 sucrose, 269; 35 Na/105 sucrose, 259; 140 NMG, 295; the internal (pipette) solution contained (in mm): 35 NaCl, 105 CsF, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, with pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH (286 mosmol-kg–1 H2O).Single-channel recordings were performed with bilayer-incorporated Na+ channels incubated with 50 μm batrachotoxin as previously described (8Becker S. Prusak-Sochaczewski E. Zamponi G. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Gordon R.D. French R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8229-8238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, bilayers were formed from a 4:1 mixture of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti Polar-Lipids) solution dissolved in decane (Fisher Scientific). The decane-lipid mixture was painted on a 100- to 200-μm hole in a plastic partition between the two compartments of the experimental chamber. Sodium channels were incorporated into the bilayers from surface membrane vesicles from rat skeletal muscle. Sodium channel-containing plasmalemmal vesicles were isolated as described before (Becker et al. (8Becker S. Prusak-Sochaczewski E. Zamponi G. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Gordon R.D. French R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8229-8238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar)), sonicated, and incubated with 50 μm batrachotoxin in a 0.3 m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES solution (pH7.4), and kept at –20 °C for at least 1 day prior to use to inhibit channel inactivation. 1–5 μl of incubated vesicles (∼2.5 mg of protein/ml) were pipetted into one well of the bilayer chamber. Bath solutions were symmetric and initially contained (in mm): 50 or 200 NaCl, 10 MOPS, 0.1 EDTA, with pH adjusted to 7.0 using 10 n NaOH. The salt concentration was increased by addition of an identically buffered 2.3 m NaCl solution to both sides of the bilayer. Data were filtered at 200 Hz and digitized at 1 kHz. Blocking activities of μ-CTX derivatives D2N/R13Q, D12N/R13Q, and R13W were assayed for their dependence on ionic strength. Comments on the choice of these derivatives are given under “Results.”Data Analysis and Statistics—Ionic strength (μ) was calculated using the following equation, μ=12Σcizi2(Eq. 1) where c i is the concentration of ion species i and z i is its valence.Toxin was superfused continuously during the whole-cell experiments. Equilibrium half-blocking concentrations (IC50) for toxins were determined from the following binding isotherm, I/IO=(1-R)/{1+([toxin]/IC50)}+R(Eq. 2) where IC50 is the half-blocking concentration, R is the residual current or sub-conductance when channels are fully blocked, I O and I are the peak currents measured from a step depolarization to –10 mV from a holding potential of –100 mV before and after application of the toxin, respectively.For single-channel experiments, the unitary current amplitude was determined visually from the current records and was similar to Gaussian fits of the all-points amplitude histograms. Single-channel events were detected by the half-amplitude threshold technique using a minimum cutoff of 400 ms for blocked events. The kinetic parameters, k on and k off, were determined from mean unblocked and blocked times, 〈t u〉 and 〈t b〉, respectively, as follows: k on = 1/(〈t u〉[toxin]), and k off = 1/t b. The reported values of K d, k on and k off, were determined from estimates at multiple voltages interpolated to 0 mV. All data reported are mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using a paired Student's t test at the 5% level.RESULTSEffects of External Na + Concentrations and Ionic Strength on μ-CTX Block of Na + Channels—We first studied the effects of ionic strength (μ) on μ-CTX block of WT Nav1.4 Na+ channels. Given the slow kinetics of toxin binding and dissociation (macroscopic time constants generally of many seconds), the current elicited by a brief test pulse (∼10 ms) from a holding potential of –100 mV reflects the fraction of channels that are not blocked by the toxin at the holding potential. Toxin-bound channels show subtle shifts of activation gating and perhaps of inactivation, which have previously been analyzed in detail, but these do not influence the assay of toxin binding by the protocol used here (28French R.J.

L.a.J.C. From Ion Channels to Cell-to-Cell Conversations. Plenum Press, New York1997: 67-89Crossref Google Scholar)External Na+ was substituted by sucrose to reduce changes in the osmolarity while varying μ. Fig. 1 shows the effects of 140 mm Na+, 70 mm Na+/70 mm sucrose, and 35 mm Na+/105 mm sucrose on the half-blocking concentration (IC50) of μ-CTX on WT Nav1.4 channels. The toxin sensitivity increased ∼18-fold as μ was lowered over the range examined. The channel mutation E758Q is known to significantly reduce μ-CTX sensitivity (11Dudley Jr., S.C. Todt H. Lipkind G. Fozzard H.A. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1657-1665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar); despite the lower toxin sensitivity of E758Q channels, μ-CTX block also increased substantially (p < 0.05) when μ was lowered (Fig. 1). Indeed, the affinity of E758Q channels for μ-CTX increased by ∼28-fold when the external solution was changed from 140 mm Na+ to 35 mm Na+/105 mm sucrose.We next investigated whether the changes in toxin affinity were directly due to the lowering of μ, changes in the permeant concentration, or both. To distinguish among these possibilities, we studied μ-CTX block of E758Q channels by substituting external Na+ with NMG+ so as to maintain both the osmotic and ionic strengths while varying [Na+]. Fig. 2 summarizes these results. In contrast to the sucrose experiments, μ-CTX sensitivity was not altered when external [Na+] was lowered from 140, to 70, and to 35 mm (p > 0.05). These results indicate that the changes observed in Fig. 1 were entirely due to the effects of ionic strength. Therefore, unlike K+ channel toxins, μ-CTX block depends on ionic strength but not, in an obligatory manner, on permeant ion concentration.Fig. 2Effects of external Na + on μ-CTX block. A, representative Na+ currents through E758Q channels recorded in the absence and presence of μ-CTX with 140, 70, and 35 mm external Na+ in the bath solution. Unlike Fig. 1, external Na+ was substituted by NMG+ in these experiments to preserve both osmotic and ionic strengths. The same protocol as described in Fig. 1 was used to elicit currents. B, bar graphs summarizing the half-blocking concentrations (IC50) for μ-CTX block of E758Q channels with 140, 70, and 35 mm external [Na+] in the bath. Under these conditions, μ-CTX sensitivity did not appear to depend on external [Na+].View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of Ionic Strength on μ-CTX Block of Single Na + Channels—To measure directly the kinetic changes, we performed single-channel recordings in neutral lipid bilayers to study the effects of ionic strength on the blockade by the μ-CTX-based derivatives D2N/R13Q, D12N/R13Q, and R13W. This approach is advantageous for two reasons. First, it is much easier to symmetrically change solutions over a wide range of ionic strength than it is using single-channel patch recording. Second, the long steady-state recordings from batrachotoxin-modified channels enable toxin association and dissociation rate constants to be determined directly from the unblocked and blocked times in a single record, for toxin kinetics varying over a wide range. This avoids the need for continuous perfusion and step changes in concentration that are required to estimate the rate constants from macroscopic recordings and allows more detailed and precise kinetic measurements.The three toxin derivatives studied in these experiments were chosen in part because they have shorter blocked times, than the native toxin, thus facilitating kinetic analysis. Wild-type μ-CTX shows mean blocked times on the order of minutes, thereby limiting the number of blocking and unblocking events that can normally be collected in a single experiment. Two of the derivatives (D2N/R13Q and D12N/R13Q) have the same nominal net charge as wild-type μ-CTX (+6), but the charge is maintained by counter charge neutralizations at widely separated locations on the toxin (cf. Ref. 30Hui K. Lipkind G. Fozzard H.A. French R.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). R13W (+5) also shows relatively rapid blocking and unblocking kinetics. All of these derivatives cause incomplete block of single-channel currents and thus enabled us to monitor the efficacy of single-channel block by the bound toxin as a function of ionic strength, while simultaneously recording binding and unbinding kinetics.Fig. 3A shows representative traces of single Na+ channel activities recorded in the absence and presence of D2N/R13Q at a test voltage of +60 mV. It is evident from these records that at low ionic strength the mean blocked and unblocked times increased and decreased, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3C, the association rate (k on) decreased dramatically (∼40-fold for D2N/R13Q), accompanied by a modest, <2-fold increase in the dissociation rate constant (k off), as [Na+] was increased from 50 to 200 mm. These changes in blocking kinetics conferred significant increases in the kinetically derived K D with increasing ionic strength (Fig. 3D), consistent with the changes in steady-state IC50 of μ-CTX block of Nav1.4 channels observed at the whole-cell level when μ was changed (cf. Fig. 1).Fig. 3Block of single Na + channels by μ-CTX mutants D2N/R13Q, D12N/R13Q, and R13W under different ionic conditions. A, representative records of single-channel activities of bilayer-incorporated muscle Na+ channels measured in the absence (with 50 mm NaCl) or presence of 1 μm μ-CTX D2N/R13Q under different ionic conditions at +60 mV. μ = [Na+] in these experiments, because ionic strength was changed by varying [Na+]. B, the residual current (R), as a fraction of the unblocked current, varies with [Na+]. All three μCTX mutants produced more complete block of single channel current at low ionic strength. C, rate constants, k on and k off, determined from the inverse of the mean unblocked and blocked times, respectively, at different ionic conditions. The kinetic parameters were determined at multiple voltages and extrapolated to 0 mV, k = k 0 exp (±zδFE/RT), where the exponential is positive for k off and negative for k on. The values shown in the bar plots are k 0 at the indicated NaCl concentration. Clearly, k on displays a dramatic dependence, whereas k off is much less affected. D, the dissociation constant, K D, was determined as the ratio k off/k on at different ionic conditions. As with the rate constants, K D extrapolated to 0 mV is shown. The combined effect of the rate constants, particularly k on, lowers toxin affinity at higher [NaCl], consistent with the whole-cell observations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In addition to the kinetics, the blocked and unblocked unitary conductances were also affected. Notably, the fractional residual conductance (R) increased with the increase in μ (Fig. 3B). Similar trends were observed for single-channel block and binding kinetics shown by the two other derivatives, D12N/R13Q and R13W (Fig. 3, B–D). The different ranges over which the fractional residual current changed depend on both size and charge of the particular amino acids substituted into the toxin (see “Discussion” and Ref. 30Hui K. Lipkind G. Fozzard H.A. French R.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).The key points to note here are the consistent increases, with decreasing ionic strength, in both the toxin binding affinity, and completeness of single channel block. We suggest that both changes are directly related to the decreased screening of various charges on the toxin and/or the channel.Arg-13 and Glu-758 Are Not Essential for Ionic Strength Dependence of Binding—Arg-13 is critical for high affinity, complete blockade of Na+ channels by μ-CTX (2Sato K.

We therefore created the μ-CTX derivative R13A by neutralizing the native basic toxin residue at position 13 by alanine substitution and studied the effects of ionic strength on its interactions with the pore. Under normal conditions (140 mm Na+), R13A, applied to WT Nav1.4 channels, displayed significantly reduced affinity and showed incomplete block of the whole-cell current even at high toxin concentrations (Fig. 4, A and B) consistent with previous single-channel observations (8Becker S.

Fig. 1, and see Fig. 5 for quantification of this dependence on ionic strength). Consistent with our observations with D2N/R13Q, D12N/R13Q, and R13W block at the single-channel level, the asymptotic residual whole-cell current at high [R13A] block was also reduced at low ionic strength. Because Arg-13 is known to interact with the domain II (DII) pore residue Glu-758 (10Chang N.S. French R.J. Lipkind G.M. Fozzard H.A. Dudley Jr., S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4407-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we studied also the ionic strength dependence of R13A block of E758Q channels (Fig. 4, C and D). Indeed, the magnitude of changes in affinity and residual currents were similar to those seen with WT Nav1.4 channels.Fig. 4Effects of ionic strength on μ-CTX R13A block of WT and E758Q channels. Representative Na+ current traces through WT (A) and E758Q (C) channels blocked by μ-CTX R13A with 140 mm Na+ and 70 mm Na+/70 mm sucrose. Dose-response relationships of block of WT (B) and E758Q (D) channels by R13A peptide under different ionic conditions. Similar to the wild-type toxin, the blocking affinity of μ-CTX R13A increased as the ionic strength lowered. Furthermore, the residual current at high toxin concentrations also decreased as the ionic strength decreased.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Effects of ionic strength on block of E758Q channels by μ-CTX R1A, K8A, K9A, K11A, D12A, K16A, and R19A. A, representative Na+ currents through E758Q channels recorded in the absence and presence of μ-CTX R1A, K9A, K11A, D12A, R13A, and K16A as indicated under different ionic conditions. B, plot of IC50 values for block of WT and E758Q channels against ionic strength (in mm) by the same μ-CTX derivatives in A. δμ = δ[Na+] in these experiments. C, the slopes obtained from linear fits of data from panel B, which reflect the dependence, on ionic strength, of binding of the indicated peptides to E758Q, are plotted. The binding of R1A, R13A, and K16A was less dependent on ionic strength than WT μ-CTX and other derivatives. These observations suggest that the interactions of different charged toxin residues are differentially affected by extracellular ionic strength.View Large Image"
https://openalex.org/W2124007045,"Cyclic nucleotides are shown to stimulate the autophosphorylation of type II cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) on multiple sites. Mass spectrometric based analyses, using a quadrupole time-of-flight-mass spectrometry instrument revealed that cGMP stimulated the in vitro phosphorylation of residues Ser110 and Ser114, and, at a slow rate, of Ser126 and Thr109 or Ser117, all located in the autoinhibitory region. In addition Ser445 was found to be phosphorylated in a cGMP-dependent manner, whereas Ser110 and Ser97 were already prephosphorylated to a large extent in Sf9 cells. cGMP-dependent phosphorylation of cGK II was also demonstrated in intact COS-1 cells and intestinal epithelium. Substitution of most of the potentially autophosphorylated residues for alanines largely abolished the cGMP stimulation of the autophosphorylation. Prolonged autophosphorylation of purified recombinant cGK II in vitro resulted in a 40–50% increase in basal kinase activity, but its maximal cGMP-stimulated activity and the EC50 for cGMP remained unaltered. Mutation of the major phosphorylatable serines 110, 114, and 445 into “phosphorylation-mimicking” glutamates had no effect on the kinetic parameters of cGK II. However, replacing the slowly autophosphorylated residue Ser126 by Glu rendered cGK II constitutively active. These results show that the fast phase of cyclic nucleotide-stimulated autophosphorylation of cGK II has a relatively small feed forward effect on its activity, whereas the secondary phase, presumably involving Ser126 phosphorylation, may generate a constitutively active form of the enzyme.

In mammalian tissues two types of cGK have been identified. Type I cGK, which has α and β isoforms, is more ubiquitously expressed and acts as a key regulator of cardiovascular homeostasis (1Lohmann S.M. Vaandrager A.B. Smolenski A. Walter U. De Jonge H.R.

In contrast, type II cGK was described originally as an intestine-specific form (4De Jonge H.R. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 14: 315-333PubMed Google Scholar) and is now known to be involved in various physiological processes, including intestinal fluid homeostasis, skeletal bone growth, renin secretion, and renal Ca2+ reabsorption (5Pfeifer A.

Furthermore, its widespread distribution in various areas of the brain suggests an important role of cGK II in NO/cGMP signaling in the central nervous system (8El-Husseini A. Bladen C. Vincent S.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2814-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison and biochemical analysis revealed a large degree of similarity in the structural organization of cGKs I and II (1Lohmann S.M. Vaandrager A.B. Smolenski A. Walter U. De Jonge H.R.

Their N terminus contains an autoinhibitory region and a leucine zipper motif, and the cGK isoforms are devoid of hydrophobic trans-membrane domains and form homo-dimers. Despite these similarities, cGK II was shown to differ from soluble type I cGK in that it behaved as a membrane- and cytoskeleton-associated protein (4De Jonge H.R. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 14: 315-333PubMed Google Scholar). N-terminal myristoylation of cGK II was found to be responsible for the different subcellular localization of the cGK isotypes (11Vaandrager A.B. Ehlert E.M. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. de Jonge H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7025-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both cGK Iα and Iβ and cGK II are known to be autophosphorylated in vitro in response to both cAMP and cGMP (4De Jonge H.R. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 14: 315-333PubMed Google Scholar, 12Aitken A. Hemmings B.A. Hofmann F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 790: 219-225Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Smith J.A.

The major autophosphorylation sites of cGK I were mapped and found to be present in the N-terminal autoinhibitory domain (12Aitken A. Hemmings B.A. Hofmann F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 790: 219-225Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 14Francis S.H. Smith J.A. Colbran J.L. Grimes K. Walsh K.A. Kumar S. Corbin J.D. J. Biol.

The cyclic nucleotide-stimulated autophosphorylation caused a shift in the affinity of cGK Iα for cAMP (15Landgraf W. Hullin R. Göbel C. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and both a shift in the EC50 for cAMP and cGMP in combination with an increase in basal activity of cGK Iβ (13Smith J.A. Francis S.H. Walsh K.A. Kumar S. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20756-20762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although cGK II was initially discovered as a major (auto)phosphorylated protein in intestinal brush-border membranes, the location of the autophosphorylation sites and the consequences of the autophosphorylation for cGK II function are not known. We here report that cGK II is autophosphorylated in vitro on multiple sites that are located close to the pseudosubstrate region in the autoinhibitory domain and on one site close to the catalytic domain. The relatively slow autophosphorylation of presumably Ser126 in the pseudosubstrate region had a major effect on the activity of cGK II, whereas autophosphorylation of the other sites had only minor effects on the kinetic parameters of cGK II. Autophosphorylation of cGK II may be physiological relevant because it was also observed in intact cells. Expression and Purification of Recombinant His-cGK II—A 2.3-kb insert, coding for mouse or human cGK II fused to an N-terminal hexahistidine tag, was cloned into the BamHI site of pFastBac1 (Invitrogen), yielding the cGK II bacmid transfer vector pFB1His6cGK II. The cGK II transfer vector was transformed into Epicurian coli XL2-Blue ultracompetent cells, and correct transformants were identified by restriction site analysis and dideoxy sequencing of the plasmid DNA. Transformation of pFB1cGK II into Max Efficiency DH10Bac cells (Invitrogen), identification of recombinant clones and isolation of the recombinant baculovirus shuttle vector DNA (bacmid) were performed according to the instructions of the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression kit purchased from Invitrogen. Recombinant baculovirus was obtained by transfection of Sf9 cells (Spodoptera frugiperda), which had been propagated as monolayers at 27 °C in TC-100 medium (Biochrom) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 4 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transfection with recombinant bacmid DNA was performed by the lipofection method using the CellFectin Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Positive viral clones were identified by their ability to direct the expression of the appropriate protein as revealed by immunoblotting of whole cell extracts of transfected Sf9 cells, which had been harvested 3–4 days post-transfection. Recombinant virus was amplified without further purification and viral titer estimated by end-point dilution. For expression of cGK II, Sf9 cells (1.0 × 1010 cells/6.2 liters) maintained as suspension cultures, were infected with the recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of >10. After 67 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 50 ml of chilled buffer A (10 mm imidazole, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mm benzamidine, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.5), and stored at –80 °C. For purification of cGK II, cells were lysed by freeze/thawing and homogenized by a glass-Teflon homogenizer followed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of buffer A and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 10 min. The combined supernatants containing the hexahistidine-tagged cGK II were loaded onto a column (inner diameter = 1 cm, flow rate = 1.0 ml/min) packed with 7 ml of a nickel-affinity resin (Qiagen), which had been equilibrated with 10 volumes of buffer A. The column was sequentially washed with 70 ml of buffer A and 20 ml of buffer B (100 mm imidazole, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mm benzamidine, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.0) prior to elution of bound cGK II with 30 ml of buffer C (250 mm imidazole, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mm benzamidine, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.0). To reduce the concentration of imidazole, the eluate (∼2 mg/ml cGK II) was diluted 1:4 with 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin and reconcentrated using Macrosep-10 concentrators (Pall Filtron). This procedure was repeated twice prior to concentration of cGK II and addition of 50% (v/v) glycerol. Protein preparations were stored at –20 °C. Construction and Expression of Mutants of cGK II—The triple mutation in rat cGK II of Ser110, Ser114, and Ser445 to Ala (3SA) was made directly from the pRc/CMV-cGK II plasmid (10Jarchau T. Häusler C. Markert T. Pöhler D. Vandekerckhove J. De Jonge H.R. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9426-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) using the Transformer™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech), with two mutagenic primers, one containing the Ser110 and Ser114 mutations and another containing the Ser445 mutation, and a selection primer targeted to the unique XbaI site (11Vaandrager A.B. Ehlert E.M. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. de Jonge H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7025-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The single Ser to Ala and Ser to Glu mutations were made directly from the pRc/CMV-cGK II plasmid, and the multiple Ser to Ala mutations were made from the 3SA mutant with the QuikChange™ Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All mutations were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing of the mutant plasmids using ABI Prism® BigDye™ Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit and an ABI Prism® 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). cDNA encoding rat cGK II or various mutants thereof in a pRc/CMV expression vector was transfected into COS-1 cells 1 day after subculturing at 80–90% confluency, by means of a 20-min incubation at 25 °C with 0.5 mg/ml DEAE-dextran in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 μg of vector DNA per 106 cells. Cells were harvested 2 days after transfection, suspended in buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin), frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C. After thawing, cells were homogenized by brief sonication (three bursts of 3 s, peak-to-peak amplitude 15–20 μm), and membranes were isolated by a 10-min centrifugation at 20,000 × g, and resuspended in buffer A to a concentration of 0.4–1 mg of protein/ml. Subsequently, cGK II was solubilized by addition of 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 m NaCl, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Determination of Autophosphorylation—To achieve autophosphorylation, purified His-cGK II (5–8 μg/ml) was incubated for various time periods at 30 °C in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 90 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (0.3 μCi/nmol). Transiently expressed rat cGK II and cGK II mutant proteins solubilized from COS cell membranes (0.4–1 mg of protein/ml) were incubated for 2 min at 30 °C in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 25 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, and 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (3 μCi/nmol). Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS-sample buffer and boiling (3 min). Subsequently, 10-μl aliquots were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and, after drying of the gels, the amount of label incorporated in cGK II was quantitated with the Molecular Imaging System GS-363 (Bio-Rad). Identification of the Autophosphorylation Sites—Affinity-purified recombinant His-cGK II (10 μg) was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.25 mm [γ-32P]ATP (2.5 μCi/nmol), and 10 μm cGMP. cGK II was denatured and precipitated by boiling for 5 min. Non-incorporated label was removed by washing with 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. The protein pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 0.5% NH4HCO3 buffer, and 1 μg of trypsin was added (1 μl of a 1 mg/ml solution). The digestion was continued at 37 °C for 8 h and terminated by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid (final concentration 0.5%). The resulting peptides were loaded onto a C18 reversed phase-HPLC column (Vydac, Separation Group, column dimension = 2.1 × 25 mm) and eluted with a linear gradient of 1% of solvent B (70% acetonitrile in 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid) per minute. Solvent A consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The gradient was controlled with an Applied Biosystems A140 gradient programmer delivering a flow rate of 80 μl/min. Peptides eluting from the column were recorded by UV adsorption and measured at 214 nm. All UV-absorbing peaks were manually collected in Eppendorf tubes, and the 32P radioactivity was counted. The sum of the radioactivity present in all positive fractions was compared with the total radioactivity present in the mixture before application on the column. One-fifth of the eluting solvent was directly deviated into the ion source of the quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass, UK) for determinations of peptide masses. Fractions containing 32P label were analyzed in detail for the presence of peptides with 80 or 98 additional atomic mass units. Phosphorylated peptides with double or triple charges were selected and subjected to fragmentation by collision with argon gas, using a collision energy of 20–35 eV. The fragmentation spectra were analyzed with MassLynx Micromass software. Peptides of interest were subjected to automated Edman degradation, using a 477A Applied Biosystems Inc. sequencer operated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—Purified recombinant mouse His-cGK II was autophosphorylated in the presence of 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min as described above in the presence or absence of 10 μm cGMP. COS-1 cells transiently expressing cGK II were grown in 12-well plates and subsequently incubated at 37 °C in culture medium with or without 50 μm 8-pCPT-cGMP (Biolog, Bremen, Germany) for 60 min and subsequently washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Stripped mouse jejunum mounted in an Ussing chamber (16Vaandrager A.B. Bot A.G.M. Ruth P. Pfeifer A. Hofmann F. De Jonge H.R. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 108-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was incubated for 15 min with or without 0.3 μm heat-stable enterotoxin STa, added to the mucosal compartment. After the incubations, the samples were suspended in 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol and boiled for 3 min. After addition of urea (9.5 m), Nonidet P-40 (3%), and the ampholytes Bio-lyte, pH 6–8 and pH 3–10, in 4:1 ratio (2%, Bio-Rad), samples were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using a Mini-PROTEAN II two-dimensional cell system (Bio-Rad) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After blotting the separated proteins, 32P label was visualized using direct autoradiography, and cGK II was detected with a specific antibody by the enhanced chemiluminescence method as described previously (16Vaandrager A.B. Bot A.G.M. Ruth P. Pfeifer A. Hofmann F. De Jonge H.R. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 108-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Determination of Protein Kinase Activity—To assess the effect of autophosphorylation on the activity of cGK II, purified recombinant His-cGK II (0.1 mg/ml) was incubated for various time periods at 30 °C in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 10 μm cGMP with 1 mm ATP (autophosphorylated) or 1 mm AMP-PNP (control). Reactions were stopped, and cyclic nucleotides were removed by a 250-fold dilution in the same buffer without ATP or cyclic nucleotides (resulting in a final 1000-fold dilution in the assay). Protein kinase activity was determined by incubation of the samples (4 ng of control or autophosphorylated His-cGK II or 4–10 μg of COS membrane protein in case of transiently expressed rat cGK II or mutants thereof) at 30 °C for 4 min in 40 μlof20mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 25 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 0.25% Triton X-100, 200 nm protein kinase A inhibitor, 0.1 mg/ml of a cGK substrate peptide 2A3 (RRKVSKQE (17Vaandrager A.B.

The reaction was started by addition of 10-μl aliquots of the cGK II preparations to 30 μl of prewarmed incubation buffer and quenched by addition of 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. The amount of label incorporated into 2A3 was quantified as described previously (17Vaandrager A.B. Edixhoven M. Bot A.G.M Kroos M.A. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. Genieser H.-G. De Jonge H.R. J. Biol.

Effect of Prolonged Activation of cGK II on Short-circuit Current in Rat Intestinal Mucosa—A 1-cm-long segment of rat jejunum was removed under light diethylether anesthesia. The muscle layers were stripped off by blunt dissection, and the mucosa was mounted in an Ussing chamber (0.3-cm2 area exposed) for measurements of short-circuit current (Isc) across the tissue as described (16Vaandrager A.B. Bot A.G.M. Ruth P. Pfeifer A. Hofmann F. De Jonge H.R. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 108-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To obtain a maximal cGK II-mediated Isc response (16Vaandrager A.B. Bot A.G.M. Ruth P. Pfeifer A. Hofmann F. De Jonge H.R. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 108-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), 50 μm 8-pCPT-cGMP was added to the serosal site. Either 30 min after addition of the cGMP analog, when a maximal Isc was reached, or 3 h after the addition, allowing a more extensive autophosphorylation of cGK II, the 8-pCPTcGMP was removed by three consecutive changes of the serosal bathing solution. After removal of the cGMP analogue the decay of the ISC back to basal levels was monitored. Autophosphorylation of Recombinant cGK II—Although autophosphorylation of cGK II is easily detectable in intestinal brush-border membranes, it proved unpractical to obtain sufficient native rat or pig cGK II purified in an intact and active form to permit detailed analysis of its autophosphorylation. Instead we used purified His-tagged, non-myristoylated, recombinant cGK II expressed in Sf9 insect cells for our studies. As shown in Fig. 1, cGMP stimulated the incorporation of phosphate into recombinant cGK II, similar to their stimulation of the autophosphorylation of native cGK II in rat brush-border membranes observed previously (4De Jonge H.R. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 14: 315-333PubMed Google Scholar). The incorporation of phosphate into cGK II was due to intramolecular autophosphorylation, because it was minimally affected by a 10-fold dilution of the enzyme or by immobilization of the His-tagged cGK II on a nickel column (data not shown). The cyclic nucleotide-stimulated autophosphorylation followed a biphasic time course: the first 2–3 mol of phosphate was incorporated within 15–30 min, whereas higher stoichiometries were reached more slowly thereafter (Fig. 1). Mapping of Autophosphorylation Sites in cGK II—To identify the major autophosphorylation sites, purified mouse recombinant cGK II was incubated for 30 min with cGMP and γ-[32P]ATP, denatured by boiling for 5 min, and cleaved with trypsin. Peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC and collected manually, guided by the UV absorbance elution profile measured at 214 nm. We also measured the radioactivity of each fraction and used it as a guide for the degree of in vitro phosphorylation. The sum of 32P counts of each fraction was 47% of the total amount initially loaded on the reversed-phase column. Because conventional HPLC separations tend to produce about 50% recoveries, we concluded that a loss of major phosphorylated peptides was very unlikely. All fractions containing a significant amount of radiolabel were subjected to Edman degradation, and the masses of their constitutive peptides were determined (see Table I). There were two fractions (28 and 69) in which both microsequencing and mass spectrometry identified a single phosphopeptide. Fraction 28 contained a doubly phosphorylated version of peptide 109–118 (numbering is according to the sequence published by Uhler (9Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13586-13591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including the first methionine to make it comparable to the rat cGK II sequence published by Jarchau et al. (10Jarchau T. Häusler C. Markert T. Pöhler D. Vandekerckhove J. De Jonge H.R. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9426-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)). Microsequencing revealed no modification at Thr109 and Ser117. In contrast, the phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) residues of Ser110 and Ser114 were clearly absent, strongly suggesting phosphorylation at the latter residues. The corresponding singly phosphorylated peptide 109–118 was found in peak fractions 29 and 30, where it was contaminated with at least three additional non-phosphorylated tryptic peptides. Differential analysis of the PTH residues after each Edman cycle identified Ser110 as the sole phosphorylated site. Additional radiolabeled fractions eluting in front of and behind fractions 28, 29, and 30 are likely to contain additional variants of peptides containing residues 110 and 114. Their heterogeneous appearance could be explained by partial tryptic cleavage at both the N- and C-terminal boundaries, each consisting of dibasic sequences, as well as by their appearance as their mono- and biphosphorylated forms. Analyses carried out on these fractions containing the remainder of the radiolabel were not sufficiently conclusive to justify incorporation into this study. Mass spectrometric analysis of recombinant mouse and human cGK II prior to cGMP-dependent autophosphorylation revealed that ∼0–10% of peptide 109–118 was unphosphorylated, whereas 90–100% was monophosphorylated, suggesting that at least Ser110 or possibly also Ser114 (but not both within one cGK II molecule) might be already prephosphorylated to some extent in the insect cells.Table IAnalysis of autophosphorylation sites in cGK IIHPLC fractionPosition in cGK IIAmino acid sequenceNumber of P sitesRadioactivity11123-132AGVS AEPTTR11328109-118TS GLVS LHSR217030109-118TS GLVSLHSR113544Multiple phosphopeptidesaSee Table II.4569444-466FS STSPFQNLEIIATLGVGGFG1104a See Table II. Open table in a new tab A clear result was obtained with the peptide present in peak 69. Its abundance allowed Edman microsequencing leading to its assignment in the region 444–466. Its determined mass (2477.98 Da) corresponds with the mass of the monophosphorylated tryptic peptide 444–466. Microsequence data showed normal recoveries of PTH-amino acid derivatives, with the exception of Ser-445, which was completely missing, suggesting that the single phosphoryl group in the peptide resides at Ser445. Peak 11 contained multiple peptides, one of which corresponded to a singly phosphorylated form of peptide AGVSA-EPTTR (123–132). This peptide peak was collected, dried, and redissolved in 2 μl of 0.05% formic acid in a 2/98 acetonitrile/water mixture. An aliquot was used for nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The fragmentation spectrum allowed unambiguous assignment of Ser126 as the only phosphorylated moiety. Because this site is equivalent to the slowly autophosphorylating Ser79 in cGKI β and Ser64 in cGKI α, which were shown to affect the activity of cGK I (Refs. 12Aitken A. Hemmings B.A. Hofmann F.

To this end, the same peptide peak was then taken from HPLC runs corresponding with the control and the 30-min and 3-h autophosphorylation samples for a semi-quantitative analysis. In addition to the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated species of peptide 123–132, this peak also contained three additional ions derived from non-phosphorylated peptides. The latter were used as internal standards, and the quantitative phosphorylation data were related to them. We measured 10 and 40% decreases of the non-phosphorylated peptide (123–132) at time points 30 min and 3 h, respectively. On the other hand, we me"
