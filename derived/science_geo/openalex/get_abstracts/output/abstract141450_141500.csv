Partial exposure of low light–adapted Arabidopsis plants to excess light results in a systemic acclimation to excess excitation energy and consequent photooxidative stress in unexposed leaves. Thus, plants possess a mechanism to communicate excess excitation energy systemically, allowing them to mount a defense against further episodes of such stress. Systemic redox changes in the proximity of photosystem II, hydrogen peroxide, and the induction of antioxidant defenses are key determinants of this mechanism of systemic acquired acclimation."
https://openalex.org/W2108366666,"The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is mutated in most human kidney cancers. The VHL protein is part of a complex that includes Elongin B, Elongin C, and Cullin-2, proteins associated with transcriptional elongation and ubiquitination. Here it is shown that the endogenous VHL complex in rat liver also includes Rbx1, an evolutionarily conserved protein that contains a RING-H2 fingerlike motif and that interacts with Cullins. The yeast homolog of Rbx1 is a subunit and potent activator of the Cdc53-containing SCFCdc4 ubiquitin ligase required for ubiquitination of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1 and for the G1 to S cell cycle transition. These findings provide a further link between VHL and the cellular ubiquitination machinery."

The magmatism coincided closely in time with a major mass extinction at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2009601307,"Only a few intracellular S-nitrosylated proteins have been identified, and it is unknown if protein S-nitrosylation/denitrosylation is a component of signal transduction cascades. Caspase-3 zymogens were found to be S-nitrosylated on their catalytic-site cysteine in unstimulated human cell lines and denitrosylated upon activation of the Fas apoptotic pathway. Decreased caspase-3 S-nitrosylation was associated with an increase in intracellular caspase activity. Fas therefore activates caspase-3 not only by inducing the cleavage of the caspase zymogen to its active subunits, but also by stimulating the denitrosylation of its active-site thiol. Protein S-nitrosylation/denitrosylation can thus serve as a regulatory process in signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2066410692,"Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells harbor Kaposi's sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) episomes and express a KSHV-encoded latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA). In PEL cells, LANA and KSHV DNA colocalized in dots in interphase nuclei and along mitotic chromosomes. In the absence of KSHV DNA, LANA was diffusely distributed in the nucleus or on mitotic chromosomes. In lymphoblasts, LANA was necessary and sufficient for the persistence of episomes containing a specific KSHV DNA fragment. Furthermore, LANA colocalized with the artificial KSHV DNA episomes in nuclei and along mitotic chromosomes. These results support a model in which LANA tethers KSHV DNA to chromosomes during mitosis to enable the efficient segregation of KSHV episomes to progeny cells."

https://openalex.org/W2093646218,"Control of cyclin levels is critical for proper cell cycle regulation. In yeast, the stability of the G 1 cyclin Cln1 is controlled by phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. Here it is shown that this reaction can be reconstituted in vitro with an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Phosphorylated Cln1 was ubiquitinated by SCF (Skp1-Cdc53–F-box protein) complexes containing the F-box protein Grr1, Rbx1, and the E2 Cdc34. Rbx1 promotes association of Cdc34 with Cdc53 and stimulates Cdc34 auto-ubiquitination in the context of Cdc53 or SCF complexes. Rbx1, which is also a component of the von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor complex, may define a previously unrecognized class of E3-associated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2053463045,"T cell receptor (TCR) signaling requires activation of Zap-70 and Src family tyrosine kinases, but requirements for other tyrosine kinases are less clear. Combined deletion in mice of two Tec kinases, Rlk and Itk, caused marked defects in TCR responses including proliferation, cytokine production, and apoptosis in vitro and adaptive immune responses to Toxoplasma gondii in vivo. Molecular events immediately downstream from the TCR were intact in rlk-/-itk-/- cells, but intermediate events including inositol trisphosphate production, calcium mobilization, and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation were impaired, establishing Tec kinases as critical regulators of TCR signaling required for phospholipase C-gamma activation."

The silica sol can “glue” a range of chemically and physically diverse particles into the three-dimensional silica network formed upon gelation. If the composite gel is supercritically dried so as to maintain the high porosity of the wet gel, a composite aerogel is formed in which the nanoscopic surface and bulk properties of each component are retained in the solid composite. The volume fraction of the second solid can be varied above or below a percolation threshold to tune the transport properties of the composite aerogel and thereby design nanoscale materials for chemical, electronic, and optical applications."

https://openalex.org/W2132070326,"Formation of hairpin and tetrahelical structures by a d(CGG) trinucleotide repeat sequence is thought to cause expansion of this sequence and to engender fragile X syndrome. Here we show that human Werner syndrome DNA helicase (WRN), a member of the RecQ family of helicases, efficiently unwinds G'2 bimolecular tetraplex structures of d(CGG)7. Unwinding of d(CGG)7 by WRN requires hydrolyzable ATP and Mg2+ and is proportional to the amount of added helicase and to the time of incubation. The efficiencies of unwinding of G'2 d(CGG)7 tetraplex with 7 nucleotide-long single-stranded tails at their 3' or 5' ends are, respectively, 3.5- and 2-fold greater than that of double-stranded DNA. By contrast, WRN is unable to unwind a blunt-ended d(CGG)7 tetraplex, bimolecular tetraplex structures of a telomeric sequence 5'-d(TAGACATG(TTAGGG)2TTA)-3', or tetramolecular quadruplex forms of an IgG switch region sequence 5'-d(TACAGGGGAGCTGGGGTAGA)-3'. The ability of WRN to selectively unwind specific tetrahelices may reflect a specific role of this helicase in DNA metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2014839221,"Gene expression is modulated by regulatory elements that influence transcription elongation by RNA polymerase: terminators that disrupt the elongation complex and release RNA, and regulators that overcome termination signals. RNA release from Escherichia coli RNA polymerase can be induced by a complementary oligonucleotide that replaces the upstream half of the RNA hairpin stem of intrinsic terminator transcripts, implying that RNA hairpins act by extracting RNA from the transcription complex. A transcription antiterminator inhibits this activity of oligonucleotides and therefore protects the elongation complex from destabilizing attacks on the emerging transcript. These effects illuminate the structure of the complex and the mechanism of transcription termination."

ATM (mutated in A-T) is a protein kinase whose activity is stimulated by I-R. c-Abl, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, interacts with ATM and is activated by ATM following I-R. Rad51 is a homologue of bacterial RecA protein required for DNA recombination and repair. Here we demonstrate that there is an I-R-induced Rad51 tyrosine phosphorylation, and this induction is dependent on both ATM and c-Abl.

In assays using purified components, phosphorylation of Rad51 by c-Abl enhances complex formation between Rad51 and Rad52, which cooperates with Rad51 in recombination and repair. After I-R, an increase in association between Rad51 and Rad52 occurs in wild-type cells but not in cells with mutations that compromise ATM or c-Abl.

Cells from individuals with A-T are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation (I-R) and chemicals that cause DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). Upon I-R, A-T cells exhibit defects in multiple cell cycle checkpoint functions, including an aberrant p53 response and DNA DSB repair (1Lavin M.F. Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev.

The DSB repair defect in A-T cells is subtle, but nevertheless contributes significantly to the radiosensitivity and chromosomal instability phenotype of these cells (4Thacker J. Int. J. Radiat.

At a time when rejoining of I-R-induced DSB is completed in normal mitotic cells, A-T cells still contain a significant number of DSBs, which may be converted into chromosomal breaks (7Foray N.

Science. 1993; 260: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In meiosis of A-T cells, the synaptonemal complexes fail to form at the pachytene stage, thus aborting gametogenesis (12Barlow C. Liyanage M. Moens P.B. Tarsounas M. Nagashima K. Brown K.

In eukaryotes, DNA DSB can be repaired by either homologous recombination or nonhomologous end-joining pathways (15Kanaar R. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination is achieved through multiple enzyme-catalyzed steps that include processing and resection of the DSB, searching for and pairing of DNA homologs, strand invasion, DNA synthesis, and finally, resolution of recombination intermediates (16Shinohara A. Ogawa T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 17Baumann P. West S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 247-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Rad51, a eukaryotic homolog of the bacterial recombinase RecA, is required for recombinational repair of DSB. In in vitro recombination assays using purified components, Rad51 catalyzes strand exchange in an ATP-dependent reaction (16Shinohara A. Ogawa T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 17Baumann P. West S.C. Trends Biochem.

Interactions between yeast Rad51 and other recombination factors including RPA, Rad52, Rad54, Rad55, and Rad57 have been described (18Milne G.T. Weaver D.T.

Recent biochemical studies have demonstrated that the strand exchange activity of Rad51 is stimulated by Rad52, Rad54, and the Rad55·Rad57 complex, indicating that the protein-protein interactions are functionally significant (22Sung P.

The results of studies with human Rad51 and Rad52 suggest that the mechanisms of DSB repair by homologous recombination are conserved in higher eukaryotes (27Benson F.E. Baumann P. West S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). ATM, the gene mutated in A-T, encodes a 370 kDa protein that is predominantly nuclear (28Chen G. Lee E.Y. J. Biol.

It contains a phosphatidylinositol kinase domain that is also present in several other proteins known to function in cellular responses to DNA damage, cell cycle control, and telomere maintenance (32Savitsky K. Bar-Shira A. Gilad S. Rotman G. Ziv Y. Vanagaite L. Tagle D.A. Smith S. Uziel T. Sfez S. et al.Science. 1995; 268: 1749-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar, 33Savitsky K. Sfez S.

Upon activation by DNA damage, the ATM kinase phosphorylates p53 on serine 15, which results in stabilization of p53 (34Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar, 35Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). In addition to modifying p53, ATM is also required for the activation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl (36Shafman T. Khanna K.K. Kedar P. Spring K. Kozlov S. Yen T. Hobson K. Gatei M. Zhang N. Watters D. et al.Nature. 1997; 387: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 37Baskaran R. Wood L.D. Whitaker L.L. Canman C.E. Morgan S.E. Xu Y. Barlow C. Baltimore D. Wynshaw-Boris A. Kastan M.B. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1997; 387: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). ATM binds c-Abl constitutively and may phosphorylate c-Abl on serine 465, leading to enhanced kinase activity of c-Abl (37Baskaran R. Wood L.D. Whitaker L.L. Canman C.E. Morgan S.E. Xu Y. Barlow C. Baltimore D. Wynshaw-Boris A. Kastan M.B. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1997; 387: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Whether defective c-Abl activation affects DSB repair and thus contributes to the phenotypes of A-T cells remains to be addressed. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the aberrant DNA repair phenotype of A-T cells is due at least in part to defective modulation of protein components of the DNA DSB repair machinery by ATM kinase-mediated signals. We provide evidence that ATM and c-Abl kinase are required for correct post-translational modification and assembly of Rad51 protein complexes. The monoclonal anti-ATM antibody 3E8 was made using GST-ATM-LZP fusion protein as the immunogen. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against human Rad51 and Rad52 were produced using HisRad51 and HisRad52 purified from bacteria. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies 4G10 and RC20, anti-β-actin antibody, and anti-Myc antibody 9E10 were from Upstate Biotechnologies, Transduction Laboratories, Sigma, and Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, respectively. 8E9 and P6D are monoclonal antibodies that recognize human c-Abl. Human Rad51 and Rad52 were overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Consecutive chromatographic steps involving Q-Sepharose, Ni-NTA-agarose (for histidine-tagged Rad51 only), Affi-blue, hydroxyapatite, and Mono-Q were performed to purify Rad51, and chromatography on Ni-NTA and Mono-S columns was used to purify histidine-tagged Rad52. Myc-tagged c-Abl, overexpressed in COS-7 cells by transient transfection, was purified by affinity chromatography with the 9E10 antibody immobilized on agarose. The Myc epitope peptide was used to compete off the c-Abl bound to the column. Cells were lysed in EBC buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mmNa3VO4) plus protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described earlier (28Chen G. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33693-33697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), using secondary antibodies cross-linked to magnetic beads (Dynal Inc. Oslo, Norway). To study whether protein complex formation requires DNA, immunoprecipitation was performed in the presence of ethidium bromide (20 μg/ml), and the immunoprecipitates were treated with 100 units of DNase I at 37 °C for 1 h. To examine Rad51 tyrosine phosphorylation, immunoblots containing Rad51 were incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. After detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), bound antibodies in the blot were stripped off by incubation in 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.0, for 30 min. Total Rad51 amounts in the blot were determined with anti-Rad51 antibody. In GST pull-down assays, 1 μg of GST or GST fusion proteins that had been absorbed on glutathione beads was incubated with target proteins in EBC buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. To examine the effects of Rad51 phosphorylation by c-Abl on interaction between Rad51 and Rad52, 1 μg of Rad51 was incubated with affinity purified wild-type or kinase inactive (K290R) c-Abl in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP) at 30 °C for 20 min. After addition of genistein to inactivate the c-Abl kinase, Rad51 in the kinase reactions was subjected to immunoprecipitation with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Rad51 antibody and the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. Secondary antibodies conjugated with magnetic beads were used to capture the immune complex. 0.5 μg of Rad52 was then added to the mixture containing free and antibody-bound Rad51 and incubated at 4 °C for 45 min. Rad51 and Rad52 levels in antibody-bound and -unbound fractions were determined by immunoblotting with their respective antibodies. His6-Rad51 cDNA was cloned into pCMV vector for expression in mammalian cells. Specific tyrosine residues of Rad51 were mutated to phenylalanine using Quick-changeTM(Stratagene). 8 μg of pSV40-Myc-c-Abl or -K290R-c-Abl, together with 2 μg of pCMV-His6-Rad51, were used to transfect COS-7 cells in one 10-cm plate. Two days later, the transfected cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 in EBC buffer containing 1 mmNa3VO4 and protease inhibitors. His6-Rad51 in the cell lysates was absorbed to Ni-NTA resin. Proteins bound to the Ni-NTA resin were eluted with 250 mm imidazole in EBC and were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-Rad51 antibody. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated His6-Rad51 was detected by immunoblotting with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody RC20. We used glutathione beads with glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-ATM fusion proteins as the ligand to bind cellular proteins that may associate with ATM. Rad51 and c-Abl bound to a GST-ATM fusion protein encompassing the leucine zipper and proline-rich region (LZP) of ATM (residues 980–1, 437, Fig.1 a, lane 3) but not to GST or a GST-ATM-N (a fusion protein containing residues 249–523 of ATM) (Fig. 1 a, lanes 2 and 4). Immunoprecipitation was then carried out to further assess the association between ATM, c-Abl, and Rad51. Each of these three proteins was detected in immunoprecipitations with anti-ATM, anti-c-Abl or anti-Rad51 antibodies but not with preimmune IgG (Fig. 1 b). Treatment of the immunoprecipitates with DNase I had no effect on the association between ATM, c-Abl, and Rad51, indicating that complex formation among these proteins is probably not mediated by DNA (Fig.1 b). The amount of co-immunoprecipitating proteins did not change significantly after I-R treatment (data not shown). Previous studies have demonstrated an ATM-dependent activation of c-Abl tyrosine kinase following I-R (36Shafman T. Khanna K.K. Kedar P. Spring K. Kozlov S. Yen T. Hobson K. Gatei M. Zhang N. Watters D. et al.Nature. 1997; 387: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 37Baskaran R. Wood L.D. Whitaker L.L. Canman C.E. Morgan S.E. Xu Y. Barlow C. Baltimore D. Wynshaw-Boris A. Kastan M.B. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1997; 387: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Prompted by the physical interaction between Rad51 and c-Abl, we examined if Rad51 is tyrosine phosphorylated before and after I-R. Extracts prepared from T24 cells before and after I-R treatment were immunoprecipitated with anti-Rad51 antibody followed by sequential immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-Rad51 antibodies. Although the levels of Rad51 did not change, tyrosine phosphorylation of Rad51 increased more than 3-fold following I-R treatment (Fig.2 a). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Rad51 was also examined in embryonic fibroblasts established from wild-type mice, mice with nullizygous c-Abl mutation (38Tybulewicz V.L. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar), and also from ATM knockout mice (14Xu Y. Ashley T. Brainerd E.E. Bronson R.T. Meyn M.S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2411-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Induction of Rad51 tyrosine phosphorylation after I-R was seen in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), but not in c-Abl−/− or ATM−/− MEF (Fig. 2 b). Thus, the induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Rad51 is dependent upon both ATM and c-Abl. An elevated basal level of Rad51 tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in c-Abl−/− MEFs (Fig. 2 b). The reason for this result is unknown, but it could be because of the presence of a compensatory mechanism that results in an elevated basal level of c-Abl-like activity in c-Abl−/− MEF, which also leads to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of other c-Abl substrates (37Baskaran R. Wood L.D. Whitaker L.L. Canman C.E. Morgan S.E. Xu Y. Barlow C. Baltimore D. Wynshaw-Boris A. Kastan M.B. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1997; 387: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Whether Rad51 protein can serve as a direct substrate for c-Abl was tested using purified Rad51, Myc-tagged c-Abl and kinase-inactive c-Abl (39Yuan Z.M. Huang Y. Whang Y. Sawyers C. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Nature. 1996; 382: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Rad51 (Fig. 3 a) was phosphorylated by active c-Abl but not by the kinase-inactive c-Abl. Immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody indicates that phosphorylation of Rad51 by c-Abl occurred on tyrosine residues (Fig.3 a). To investigate possible Rad51 phosphorylation by c-Ablin vivo, Rad51 was expressed together with kinase inactive or active c-Abl in COS-7 cells. Co-expression of Rad51 with wild-type c-Abl, but not kinase inactive c-Abl, stimulated Rad51 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3 b). Mutation of Rad51 Tyr315, but not Tyr205, Tyr191, or Tyr54 to phenylalanine abolished Rad51 tyrosine phosphorylation by c-Abl (Fig. 3 b). These results strongly suggest that c-Abl phosphorylates Rad51 Tyr315 in vivo. Interestingly, Rad51 Tyr315 is present in a YXXP context, a substrate sequence preferred by c-Abl kinase activity (40Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1981-1989PubMed Google Scholar), and is a highly conserved residue in Rad51 in all known species of the animal kingdom. To determine whether the elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of Rad51 in c-Abl−/− MEFs is because of phosphorylation on Tyr315, wild-type and Y315F Rad51 was expressed in these cells by transient transfection. The levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type and Y315F Rad51 were similar (Fig. 3 c), suggesting that the majority of Rad51 tyrosine phosphorylation in c-Abl−/− MEF does not occur on Tyr315. Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that Rad51 cooperates with Rad52 in recombinational DNA repair (18Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1755-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar,22Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28194-28197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 23Shinohara A. Ogawa T.

Whether phosphorylation of Rad51 by c-Abl modulates its interaction with human Rad52 was investigated in binding assays employing purified Rad51 and Rad52 (Fig.4 a). To avoid interference from possible un-phosphorylated Rad51, anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was used to isolate tyrosine phosphorylated Rad51 after kinase reaction with wild-type c-Abl (Fig. 4 b). Approximately 4-fold more Rad52 was associated with tyrosine phosphorylated Rad51 than with Rad51 treated with K290R c-Abl (Fig. 4 b), indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of Rad51 by c-Abl enhances its interaction with Rad52in vitro. Because I-R induces Rad51 tyrosine phosphorylation in wild-type cells, but not in ATM−/− or c-Abl−/− MEF, we examined the association between Rad51 and Rad52 in cells with these distinct genetic backgrounds before and after I-R. Extracts prepared from mock-treated and irradiated T24, wild-type MEF, as well as c-Abl−/− and ATM−/− MEF were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-Rad51 antibody. The level of Rad52 in the Rad51 immunoprecipitates was quantitated by immunoblotting with anti-Rad52 antibody. Significantly more (>3-fold) Rad52 was co-precipitated after I-R treatment of T24 and wild-type MEF. In contrast, enhanced association of Rad51 and Rad52 was not seen in c-Abl−/− or ATM−/− MEF after I-R (Fig.5 a). I-R did not affect the overall levels of Rad51 and Rad52 proteins (Fig. 5 b). Thus, the I-R-induced association between Rad51 and Rad52 appears to correlate with the I-R-induced Rad51 tyrosine phosphorylation. Interestingly, there was an elevated association of Rad51 and Rad52 in c-Abl−/− MEF before I-R treatment (Fig. 5 a), perhaps because of the increased basal level of Rad51 tyrosine phosphorylation in these cells. Because A-T cells arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle are radiosensitive, it appears that defective checkpoint control is not the only cause of radiosensitivity of A-T cells (4Thacker J. Int.

Ataxia Telangiectasia-A Cellular and Molecular Link Between Cancer, Neurophathology and Immune Deficiency. Wiley Press, Chichester1982Google Scholar). Moreover, the aberrant mitotic recombination and elevated chromosomal breaks in A-T cells after I-R suggest that ATM plays a direct role in the repair of DNA DSB (1Lavin M.F. Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev.

In this study, we report that ATM and ATM-mediated signaling are required for both Rad51 phosphorylation and enhanced assembly of recombination complexes. Our data support the hypothesis that defective modulation of repair proteins may underlie the DNA repair deficiency in A-T cells. Genetic and biochemical studies have assigned a central role for Rad51 in homologous recombination. The other recombination factors, Rad52, Rad54, and Rad55·Rad57 stimulate the strand exchange activity of Rad51 (22Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28194-28197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 23Shinohara A. Ogawa T.

This stimulation likely requires direct interaction between the recombination proteins because mutant Rad52 lacking the Rad51 binding site failed to stimulate Rad51-mediated strand exchange (23Shinohara A. Ogawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Our study has identified an I-R-induced phosphorylation of Rad51 on tyrosine residues and a concomitant increase in association between Rad51 and Rad52, which may lead to increased DNA repair proficiency. The enhanced association of Rad51 and Rad52 after I-R is likely because of Rad51 tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by ATM and c-Abl since the enhanced binding was also observed after phosphorylation of Rad51 by c-Abl in vitro. It is not yet known whether phosphorylation of Rad51 affects its binding with other members of the recombination complex. While this study was in progress, Yuan et al. (41Yuan Z.M. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Utsugisawa T. Kharbanda S. Wang R. Sung P. Shinohara A. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3799-3802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) reported that phosphorylation of yeast and human Rad51 by c-Abl inhibited the binding of Rad51 to DNA. Furthermore, the strand exchange activity of yeast Rad51 also decreased upon treatment with c-Abl (41Yuan Z.M. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Utsugisawa T. Kharbanda S. Wang R. Sung P. Shinohara A. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3799-3802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The authors concluded that c-Abl might have inhibitory effects on Rad51 activitiesin vivo. In contrast, our studies of Rad51·Rad52 complex formation in vitro and in vivo suggest that the ATM and c-Abl-mediated signaling is likely to promote repair given the biochemical evidence that Rad51 acts in concert with Rad52 in homologous recombination (22Sung P.

Future biochemical studies are needed to address whether in the presence of Rad52, Rad51 would indeed exhibit higher recombinase activity upon phosphorylation by c-Abl.

TheI f current was characterized by activation by hyperpolarizing voltage steps; mixed permeability for Na+and K+; inhibition by extracellular Cs+, not by Ba2+; and a positive shift in the voltage-dependent activation curve by intracellular cyclic nucleotide (1Yanagihara K.

Physiol. 1994; 426: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Based on the above physiological properties, the functional roles ofI f in the SA node have been discussed in many publications. I f is one of the inward currents that generate pacemaker depolarization (7Denyer J.C. Brown H.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 429: 401-409Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 8Ginneken A.G.C. Giles W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 434: 57-83Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 9DiFrancesco D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 455-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The pacemaker cells of the SA node are coupled to surrounding atrial myocytes through gap junctions. Since atrial myocytes have more negative resting membrane potentials, they hyperpolarize pacemaker cells electrotonically (10Watanabe E. Honjo H. Anno T. Boyett M.R. Kodama I. Toyama J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H1742-H1753Google Scholar). Pacemaker cell I f is activated under this condition; therefore; the inward I f current is likely to limit the level of hyperpolarization of pacemaker cells (1Yanagihara K. Irisawa H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1980; 385: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Recently, three full-length (mouse BCNG-1, -2, and -4; corresponding to HAC2, -1, and -3, respectively) and one partial (mouse BCNG-3) mammalian cDNA clones encoding I f were isolated from a mouse brain cDNA library (11Santoro B.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 5-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and one cDNA clone was isolated from sea urchin testis (SPIH) (15Gauss R. Seifert R. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). However, despite the physiological significance of I f in the SA node, its molecular characteristics still remain unclear. Therefore, we have screened a rabbit heart SA node cDNA library and isolated a cDNA (HAC4). HAC4 is composed of 1150 amino acid residues and most likely encodes I f. In this study, we demonstrate the amino acid sequence of HAC4, the distribution of HAC4 mRNA in cardiac tissue, and the electrophysiological properties of HAC4 heterologously expressed in COS-7 cells. The cloning procedure was performed as described previously (16Ishii T. Moriyoshi K. Sugihara H. Sakurada K. Kadotani H. Yokoi M. Akazawa C. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Masu M. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2836-2843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA templated by mRNA isolated from rat brain was used as a DNA template for polymerase chain reaction amplification. The 5′ (P1) and 3′ (P2) sequences were derived from mouse HAC2 (13Ludwig A. Zong X. Jeglitsch M. Hofmann F. Biel M. Nature. 1998; 393: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) and are as follows (N represents A/G/C/T): P1, 5′-ATG(C/T)TNTG(T/C)AT(T/C/A)GGNTA(T/C)GG-3′; and P2, 5′-AT(A/G)TA(A/G)TCNCCNGG(T/C)TG(A/G)AA-3′. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed according to the following schedule: five cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 46 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, followed by 26 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The polymerase chain reaction products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, excised, and purified with QIAEX-II (QIAGEN Inc.) for subsequent subcloning and sequence determination. Through this procedure, we identified a clone for a rat homologue of mouse HAC2, pR1. A cDNA library was prepared from rabbit heart SA node regions. Using pR1 as a probe, 5 × 104 phage clones of the cDNA library were hybridized for the isolation of a new clone (washed with 2× SSC at 55 °C). Five positive clones were isolated and sequenced. All of them were identical. A representative clone, pIH1, was subjected to sequence determination. Both strands of the cDNA sequence were determined by the chain termination method (BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing, Applied Biosystems, Inc.). The clone contains 3396 base pairs of cDNA that comprises a large open reading frame. However, the cDNA does not possess a termination codon in the C-terminal region. Therefore, we performed 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Marathon cDNA amplification kit, CLONTECH) and obtained the C-terminal region of the clone by using proofreadingTaq polymerase (LA Taq, TaKaRa). We added the C-terminal region amplified by the proofreading Taq polymerase to pIH1 by using a SacI restriction site. Northern blots, prepared with 2 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from the indicated rabbit tissues (atrium does not contain the SA node region), were probed in hybridization solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 50% formamide at 42 °C with a radiolabeled DNA fragment derived from the coding region of pIH1 (corresponding to amino acids 707–1116), washed with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C with an intensifying screen for 84 h. HAC4 cDNA and green fluorescent protein S65A cDNA (a gift from Dr. K. Moriyoshi) were subcloned into independent PCI vectors (Promega), and the mixture of vectors were transfected into COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. The vector amounts were 1.6 μg/35-mm dish for HAC4 and 0.4 μg/35-mm dish for green fluorescent protein. COS-7 cells (Riken) were cultured on coverslips in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and antibiotics. 36–48 h after transfection, a coverslip was transferred to the recording chamber on an inverted microscope (TMD300, Nikon), and patch-clamp experiments were carried out in green fluorescent protein-positive cells using Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.). The data were directly recorded on the hard disk of an IBM-PC compatible computer thorough an AD converter (Digipack 1200, Axon Instruments, Inc.) and were analyzed using commercially available software (pClamp6 and Clampex7, Axon Instruments, Inc.). The data points represent the means ± S.E. The statistical difference was evaluated using Student's unpaired t test. The composition of the bathing solution was 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Appropriate amounts of KCl, CsCl, and BaCl2 were added in some experiments. The pipette solution contained 130 mmKCl, 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mmMgATP, and 5 mm disodium creatine phosphate. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with KOH. The final K+ concentration was ∼145 mm. In some experiments, 0.3 mm cAMP was added to the pipette solution, and the pH was readjusted to 7.4 with KOH. All patch-clamp experiments were carried out at 35 °C by perfusing the bathing solution through a water jacket. The transmembrane region of rat HAC2 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction method with a rat brain cDNA mixture and was used to screen a rabbit SA node cDNA library. The most 5′ methionine codon in the positively hybridizing clone (pIH1) initiated an open reading frame that did not contain a termination codon in the 3′-terminal region. 3′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed to obtain the 3′-terminal region, and pIH1 lacked 103 base pairs of the 3′-coding region. The 3′-terminal region was amplified by proofreading Taq polymerase and attached to pIH1. The sequence (HAC4) (Fig. 1) predicts a protein of 1150 amino acid residues with six transmembrane domains, a pore region, and a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain. HAC4 shows 85–90 and 80–96% identities to HAC1–3 in the transmembrane region and the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain, respectively. HAC4 is most related to mouse BCNG-3. Although full-length mouse BCNG-3 cDNA has not been cloned, the partial sequence of mouse BCNG-3 was 96% homologous to the transmembrane region of HAC4. The predicted N- and C-terminal regions of HAC4 are notably longer than those of the rest of the HAC clones. The last five amino acid residues (corresponding to positions 1146–1150) at the C terminus were conserved in all HAC clones. The amino acid sequence corresponding to positions 1045–1055 was also conserved in all HAC clones. The rest of the C-terminal regions were remarkably diverse. To examine the expression of HAC4 mRNA, we performed Northern blotting (Fig.2). Since the C-terminal regions are diverse among HAC family members, we synthesized a radiolabeled DNA fragment derived from the coding region corresponding to amino acids 707–1116. It is clear from Fig. 2 that HAC4 was the most highly expressed in the SA node among the cardiac tissues examined. Unlike HAC1–3, HAC4 was not significantly expressed in brain. The size of the mRNA for HAC4 was estimated to be 7.1 kilobases, although presumably a partially processed transcript was detected. Fig.3 A shows representative current traces of HAC4 expressed in COS-7 cells. When a voltage step was more negative than −60 mV, slowly activating inward currents were activated. Such a current was not observed when COS-7 cells were transfected with an empty vector (data not shown). The current activation appeared to be the sum of two exponential time courses. For example, time constants of current activation were 384 ± 71 and 2275 ± 319 ms at −110 mV (n = 6). These values were similar to those reported for the I fcurrent of rabbit SA node cells (17Maruoka M. Nakashima Y. Takano M. Ono K. Noma A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 477: 423-435Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 B shows the current-voltage (I-V) relationship. The closed circles indicate the amplitude of the initial current measured at the beginning of hyperpolarizing pulses. The open circlesare the steady-state I-V relationship measured at the end of pulses. It is clear from Fig. 3 B that the threshold of current activation was between −60 and −70 mV. The voltage dependence of current activation was further analyzed by measurements of outward tail currents (Fig. 3 C). Under control conditions, hyperpolarizing voltage steps to −40 and −50 mV did not elicit the outward tail current. When the voltage step was −60 mV, a miniature tail current was recorded. The amplitude of the tail current increased as the conditioning voltage became more negative and saturated at −140 mV. It is well known that intracellular cAMP produces a positive shift in the voltage dependence of the activation of the I f and HAC1 currents in a dose-dependent manner. The maximal effect was obtained at ∼0.1 mm cAMP (4DiFrancesco D. Tortora P. Nature. 1991; 351: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 13Ludwig A. Zong X. Jeglitsch M. Hofmann F. Biel M. Nature. 1998; 393: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). In accordance with these reports, an obvious tail current was elicited by hyperpolarization to −50 mV in the presence of intracellular 0.3 mm cAMP (Fig.3 C, right panel). In Fig. 3 (C andD), the outward tail current (I tail) measured at 0 mV was normalized by the maximal value (I max) in the presence (▿) and absence (▾) of 0.3 mm cAMP. In each experiment, we fitted the Boltzmann function to the data points:I tail/I max = 1/(1 + exp((V m − V h)/S)), where V m is the test potential,V h is the membrane potential for half-maximal activation, and S is the slope factor. Under control conditions, V h was −87.4 ± 2.8 mV, andS was 9.6 ± 0.8 mV (n = 10). In the presence of 0.3 mm cAMP, the value of V hshifted toward the positive direction (−64.4 ± 2.6 mV (n = 7); p < 0.01), whereasS did not change significantly (7.9 ± 0.4 mV (n = 7); p > 0.05). The shift inV h was 23 mV, which was clearly larger than those in other mammalian clones such as mouse BCNG-1 (corresponding to HAC2; 2 mV) (12Santoro B. Liu D.T. Yao H. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R.

The magnitude of the block was estimated by measuring the amplitude of time-dependent currents in the presence and absence of blockers. At −90 mV, 3 mm Cs+ partially blocked the HAC4 current. The magnitude of the block was 70.8 ± 5.4%, which was smaller than reported for mouse BCNG-1 and HAC1. The outward tail current was also suppressed by extracellular Cs+. 3 mmBa2+ blocked only 9.6 ± 2.0% of the HAC4 current. It is well known that both Na+ and K+ permeateI f in native pacemaker cells (3DiFrancesco D. Ferroni A. Mazzanti M. Trobba C. J. Phyiol. (Lond.). 1986; 377: 61-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 5Frace M. Maruoka M. Noma A. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

In Fig.4 B, we examined the ion selectivity of HAC4 by measuring the reversal potential, which was determined by intersections between theI-V curve of initial tail currents (closed symbols in the I-V diagrams) and the I-V curve of late tail currents (data not plotted). Reversal potentials were −34.2 ± 0.9 mV (n = 8) in 5 mmK+o and −25.5 ± 0.9 mV (n = 7) in 20 mm K+o. The permeability ratio for Na+ and K+(P Na/P K) was calculated from the following equation: E rev = (RT/F)·ln(([K+]o +P Na/P K[Na+]o)/([K+]i+P Na/P K[Na+]i)), where P Na is the permeability for Na+; P K is the permeability for K+; E rev is the reversal potential; and R, T, and F are the usual thermodynamic parameters. TheP Na/P K ratios were 0.25 ± 0.01 in 5 mm K+o and 0.26 ± 0.01 in 20 mm K+o. It is also clear from Fig. 4 B that extracellular K+increased the inward Na+ conductance in a concentration-dependent manner. In the absence of extracellular K+, no obvious time-dependent current was activated during the hyperpolarization. These properties are in good agreement with those of the I fcurrent in native pacemaker cells (5Frace M. Maruoka M. Noma A. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1992; 421: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Besides Na+ and K+, Li+ also permeates I f (17Maruoka M. Nakashima Y. Takano M. Ono K. Noma A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 477: 423-435Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In Fig. 4 C, we compared the permeability of K+, Na+, and Li+ through HAC4. When 140 mmNa+]o was replaced with 140 mmLi+]o in the presence of 5 mmK+]o, the amplitude of the outward tail current dramatically increased. Under these conditions, the reversal potential shifted to −63.7 ± 1.8 mV (n = 3). When we estimated P Li/P K by ignoring intracellular Na+, theP Li/P K ration was 0.06. The time course of the decay of the outward tail current became slower in 140 mm Li+o solution. In 140 mm K+o, the reversal potential was −2.6 ± 0.1 mV (n = 3). These properties were similar to those reported for I f in native pacemaker cells (17Maruoka M. Nakashima Y. Takano M. Ono K. Noma A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 477: 423-435Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this study, we have cloned a cDNA (HAC4) and demonstrated that HAC4 encodes I f. HAC4 is composed of 1150 amino acid residues. Both the cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal regions of HAC4 are longer than those of HAC1–3. We could not exclude the possibility that the N terminus of HAC4 was not complete because we have not obtained a clone that has an in-frame stop codon in front of the assigned start codon. However, the N-terminal region contained enough length and showed weak but significant homology compared with other HAC clones. Moreover, the cDNA of HAC4 generated robust functional I f currents when expressed in COS-7 cells. These findings might support the idea that the cDNA of HAC4 contains the entire coding sequence. The C-terminal region of HAC4 showed remarkably low homology compared with other HAC clones. The amino acid sequence of the transmembrane region of HAC4 was 89% homologous to HAC1 (mouse BCNG-2), 86% to HAC2 (mouse BCNG-1), 85% to HAC3 (presumably a splicing variant of mouse BCNG-4), and 97% to mouse BCNG-3 (14Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1998; 21: 5-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The partial sequence of the N-terminal region (82 amino acid residues) of mouse BCNG-3 was also homologous to HAC4 (89%). Therefore, HAC4 may be the rabbit homologue of mouse BCNG-3. It is difficult, however, to conclude this matter because only a partial sequence of mouse BCNG-3 has been determined (506 amino acids), and in particular, the amino acid sequence of the C-terminal region of mouse BCNG-3 has not been determined. Although HAC4 and mouse BCNG-3 are highly homologous, their expression patterns seem different; in mouse, BCNG-3 is expressed in cardiac tissue, but not in the SA node. BCNG-3 is also expressed in mouse brain and skeletal muscle (12Santoro B. Liu D.T. Yao H. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 717-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). In contrast, HAC4 mRNA is highly expressed in rabbit heart SA node. In other parts of cardiac tissues, brain, and skeletal muscle, HAC4 signals are not significant. We do not have ready explanations for this difference. In Northern blotting, we used the sequence that corresponds to amino acids 707–1116. Because the amino acid sequence of the corresponding region of mouse BCNG-3 had not been determined, we could not exclude the possibility that the C-terminal region was not homologous between HAC4 and mouse BCNG-3. Another possibility may be that the different expression pattern is simply due to the difference of species. In accordance with the distribution of HAC4 mRNA, the electrophysiological properties of HAC4 closely resembled those of theI f current reported in native pacemaker cells isolated from rabbit SA node. In native pacemaker cells, particularly during β-adrenergic stimulation, the separation ofI f and delayed rectifier K+(I dK) currents was difficult because the activation of I f was overlapped by the deactivation of I dK (1Yanagihara K. Irisawa H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1980; 385: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 19Yanagihara K. Irisawa H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1980; 388: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this study, there was no time-dependent current in COS-7 cells other than the heterologously expressed HAC4 current, which enabled us to measure voltage-dependent gating ofI f more precisely. The threshold of current activation was between −60 and −70 mV under control conditions and between −40 and −50 mV in the presence of intracellular 0.3 mm cAMP. The V h of HAC4 (−87.4 mV) was more positive than that of HAC1 (−103 mV) or mouse BCNG-1 (HAC2; −100 mV). In HAC4, the positive shift in V h was 23 mV in the presence of 0.3 mm cAMP, which was clearly larger than that in HAC1 (12 mV by 0.1 mm cAMP) or mouse BCNG-1 (2 mV by 3 mm cAMP). In native pacemaker cells, the activation curve of I f was considerably different from cell to cell (3DiFrancesco D. Ferroni A. Mazzanti M. Trobba C. J. Phyiol. (Lond.). 1986; 377: 61-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 8Ginneken A.G.C. Giles W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 434: 57-83Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This variety may be explained in two ways. Intracellular cAMP concentration may be different from cell to cell; alternatively, I f in the SA node may be a heteromultimer composed of different HAC subunits, and their composition may be different from cell to cell, although we do not have information on the expression level of other HAC clones in rabbit SA node. In the latter case, it appears reasonable to expect that the heteromultimer may possess a property intermediate between those of HAC4 and other HAC family members. The functional role of I f in the SA node is to generate pacemaker depolarization (7Denyer J.C. Brown H.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 429: 401-409Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 8Ginneken A.G.C. Giles W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 434: 57-83Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 9DiFrancesco D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 455-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) and to limit the hyperpolarization of pacemaker cells caused by electronic coupling with atrial myocytes (1Yanagihara K.

Physiol. 1995; 269: H1742-H1753Google Scholar). The significance of I fin the generation of pacemaker potential still appears to be a matter of debate (17Maruoka M. Nakashima Y. Takano M. Ono K.

Targeting of the HAC gene should provide a clue to address this question. To conduct such an experiment, it is essential to determine the molecular characteristics ofI f in the SA node. In this study, we have demonstrated that HAC4 forms I f in the SA node. This molecular identification of HAC4 in the SA node would facilitate the understanding of the physiological function ofI f.

Here, it is shown that DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a host cell protein, also participates in the reaction. DNA-PK-deficient murine scid cells infected with three different retroviruses showed a substantial reduction in retroviral DNA integration and died by apoptosis. Scid cell killing was not observed after infection with an integrase-defective virus, suggesting that abortive integration is the trigger for death in these DNA repair-deficient cells. These results suggest that the initial events in retroviral integration are detected as DNA damage by the host cell and that completion of the integration process requires the DNA-PK-mediated repair pathway."

Evolution of this state was monitored by time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy using an ultrafast probe pulse. The excited n = 4 clusters showed simple population decay, but in the n = 5 and 6 clusters the solvent molecules rearranged to stabilize and localize the excess electron, showing characteristics associated with electron solvation dynamics in bulk water. Comparison of the FPES of I − (D 2 O) n with I − (H 2 O) n indicates more rapid solvation in the H 2 O clusters."

We recently reported that interleukin (IL)-6 is an essential mediator of growth factor-induced proliferation of lung fibroblasts.

Transient transfections of fibroblasts with a luciferase reporter gene construct containing nucleotides −651 to +1 of the human IL-6 promoter revealed that TGF-β1 also potently activated IL-6 promoter activity. Progressive 5′-deletions and site-directed mutagenesis of the parental construct located the TGF-β1-responsive cis-regulatory element to a known activating protein-1 (AP-1) sequence (nucleotides −284 to −276). Gel shift analyses revealed that AP-1 DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts was increased 30 min after stimulation with TGF-β1. In contrast, neither CCAAT enhancer-binding protein-β, NF-κB, nor Sp1 were activated by TGF-β1. Supershift analyses demonstrated that the AP-1 complex induced by TGF-β1 was composed of Jun isoforms and absent of Fos isoforms. Moreover, this complex was found to be a JunD homodimer.

The TGF-β superfamily consists of more than 20 members, most important of which are the TGF-βs themselves, activins, and bone morphogenic proteins. Among the five described TGF-β isoforms, TGF-β1 is most abundant in human tissues (5Roberts A.B. Kim S.J. Noma T. Glick A.B. Lafyatis R. Lechleider R. Jakowlew S.B. Geiser A.

Signal transduction of TGF-β1 requires ligand binding to TGF-β receptors (TβR). Three TβR have been characterized (TβRI to TβRIII), TβRI and TβRII belong to the family of serine/threonine kinase receptors. Upon ligand binding to TβRII, TβRII recruits TβRI to form a heterooligomeric ligand-receptor complex. TβRI is then phosphorylated at glycine and serine residues by the constitutively active kinase TβRII, and downstream signaling is initiated (6Wrana J.L. Miner.

In mesenchymal derived cells such as fibroblasts, TGF-βs have two major effects, (i) an increase in extracellular matrix deposition and (ii) an increase in cellular proliferation (16Zhao Y.

The proliferative response of fibroblasts to mitogenic stimuli, such as TGF-β1, is preceded by increased DNA synthesis. In this respect, we have previously shown that growth factor-induced proliferation of lung tumor cell lines and primary human lung fibroblasts is essentially mediated by interleukin (IL)-6 (18Roth M. Nauck M. Tamm M. Perruchoud A.P. Ziesche R. Block L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Bihl M. Tamm M. Nauck M. Wieland H. Perruchoud A.P. Roth M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of IL-6 levels by antisense treatment resulted in abrogation of the proliferative response of fibroblasts to mitogenic stimuli, whereas the response was not affected by antisense oligonucleotides against other interleukins (18Roth M.

IL-6 expression is known to be affected by a variety of cytokines and growth factors. Up-regulation of IL-6 is reportedly controlled by the activity of several transcription factors with known consensus sequences in the IL-6 promoter region, including AP-1, C/EBP-β, and NF-κB (20Akira S. Kishimoto T. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 127: 25-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 21Yan S.F. Tritto I. Pinsky D. Liao H. Huang J. Fuller G. Brett J. May L. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11463-11471Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In a different cell culture model, TGF-β1 has been reported to up-regulate IL-6 expression (22Mazzarelli P. Scuderi F.

Transplant. 1995; 10: 1592-1597PubMed Google Scholar); however, the molecular mechanism of increased IL-6 expression in response to TGF-β1 is unknown. This study addresses the question how IL-6 expression is regulated by TGF-β1 in primary human lung fibroblasts. We found that upon stimulation with TGF-β1, IL-6 is rapidly up-regulated at the mRNA and protein level. This genomic effect of TGF-β1 is reflected at the promoter level, demonstrating rapid activation of AP-1, as shown by luciferase and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The TGF-β1-induced AP-1 complex is found to be a JunD homodimer, while Fos proteins are absent in this complex. Thus, our data provide new insight into the signaling pathway induced by TGF-β1, a major growth factor due to its prominent biological effects during induction of fibrosis, in primary human lung fibroblasts.

Amplifications were performed with 25 cycles for β-actin and 35 cycles for IL-6 cDNA. The amplification profile included denaturation at 98 °C for 15 s, primer annealing at 62 °C for 15 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. 12 μl of each PCR were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis on 3.0% agarose gels. Concentrations of IL-6 protein secreted into culture supernatants of fibroblasts were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were plated onto 24-well plates until confluent and starved in 0.1% fetal calf serum for 24 h. Fibroblasts were stimulated with different concentrations of TGF-β1 as indicated, and aliquots of the supernatants were removed at several time points. Measurements of IL-6 were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. A plasmid containing a 651-bp fragment of the human IL-6 gene promoter located directly upstream of the transcriptional start site was kindly provided by Shigeru Katamine (Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan) (25Yamashita I. Katamine S. Moriuchi R. Nakamura Y. Miyamoto T. Eguchi K. Nagataki S. Blood. 1994; 84: 1573-1578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 651-bp insert was subcloned (5′-KpnI, 3′-XhoI) into pGL3 basic luciferase reporter gene vector to give the parental pIL6-luc651 construct. From this parental construct, 5′-deletion mutants were made by deleting fragments containing the consensus sequence for transcription factor AP-1 (pIL6-luc220) or CREB (pIL6-luc160) using internal restriction sites for NheI or AatII, respectively. Within pIL6-luc651, the following consensus sites were inactivated by site-directed mutagenesis. The AP-1 consensus sequence (positions −283 to −276, 5′-TGAGTCAC-3′) was changed to 5′-TGCAGCAC-3′; the C/EBP-β consensus sequence (positions −154 to −146, 5′-TTGCACAAT-3′) was changed to 5′-CCGTTCAAT-3′; and the NF-κB consensus sequence (positions −72 to −63, 5′-GGGATTTTCC-3′) was changed to 5′-CTCATTTTCC-3′. These mutations have previously been shown to inactivate the described consensus sequences (26Dendorfer U. Oettgen P. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4443-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 27Matsusaka T. Fujikawa K. Nishio Y. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10193-10197Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). All mutant clones were verified by DNA sequencing. Two days before transfection, fibroblasts were seeded into 24-well plates (1 × 104 cells/well) precoated with 1% gelatin. After 24 h, cells were serum-deprived for 24 h and subjected to liposomal transfection using the cationic lipid Tfx-50 at a DNA:lipid ratio of 1:3 (1 μg of plasmid/well) for 2 h. Cells were then overlaid with low serum medium with or without TGF-β1 at the indicated concentrations. After 36 h of incubation, cells were harvested by active lysis, and equal amounts of lysates were analyzed for firefly luciferase expression according to the directions of the manufacturer. In brief, 20-μl aliquots of cell lysates were mixed with 100 μl of luciferase reagent buffer, and luminescence of the samples was integrated over a time period of 10 s in a LUMAC Biocounter M1500P (Landgraaf, The Netherlands). As an internal control for transfection efficiency, expression plasmids encoding Renilla luciferase driven by the thymidine kinase promoter were used (0.4 μg/well). Firefly and Renilla Luciferase have distinct substrate properties, and thus activity of both enzymes can be assessed in the same sample using two substrates sequentially (Dual Luciferase Assay, Promega). Nuclear and cytosolic extracts from TGF-β1-stimulated or -unstimulated control cells were prepared for gel shift analyses at the indicated time points. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline with a rubber policeman. Samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 6,000 ×g (4 °C), and the resulting cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of low salt buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, supplemented with a set of proteinase inhibitors, CompleteTM). After 10 min of incubation on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 2 min (4 °C), and the supernatants (cytosolic extracts) were immediately frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 60 μl of high salt buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mmNaCl, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20% glycerol, supplemented with CompleteTM), and nuclear proteins were extracted by shaking on ice for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 10 min (4 °C), and the supernatants were taken as nuclear extracts. DNA mobility shift assays were performed using oligonucleotides comprising the consensus sequences for AP-1 (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′), C/EBP-β (5′-GTAAGATTGCACAATGTA-3′), NF-κB (5′-AGTTGAGGGGATTTCCCAGGC-3′), or Sp1 (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGCGAGC-3′). Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4-polynucleotide-kinase. Aliquots of nuclear extracts (2 μg) were incubated with the labeled consensus oligonucleotides under binding conditions (4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)) in a total volume of 10 μl. Incubations were carried out at room temperature for 30 min, and protein-DNA complexes were analyzed on a 4% polyacrylamide gel. The identity of specific bands was confirmed by the addition of competitive unlabeled consensus sequence oligonucleotides and by the addition of monoclonal antibodies specific for the transcription factor of interest. All data were obtained from at least four different cell lines of primary human lung fibroblasts. Enzyme-linked immunoassay and RT-PCR were performed in duplicate using three independent sets of experiments. For statistical analysis, Student's t test and analysis of variance were performed.p < 0.01 was estimated significant. The protocol for establishing primary human cell cultures from biopsies obtained during lung surgery was approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine, University of Basel, Switzerland (approval number M75/97). We analyzed whether human lung fibroblasts, in culture, up-regulate IL-6 expression in response to TGF-β1 by qualitative RT-PCR. Fig.1 A demonstrates a characteristic agarose gel of RT-PCR products amplifying IL-6 and β-actin mRNA from cells treated with TGF-β1 at different concentrations for 8 h. The expected size of IL-6 mRNA was 565 bp, and the expected size of the constitutive message for β-actin serving as an internal control was 225 bp. RT-PCR indicated that human lung fibroblasts up-regulated IL-6 mRNA in response to TGF-β1 (0.01–1.0 ng/ml) in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). As shown in Fig. 1 A, IL-6 mRNA was clearly up-regulated as compared with control levels 8 h after stimulation with TGF-β1. RT-PCR, although not performed quantitatively, thus indicated that TGF-β1 led to a dose-dependent increase in IL-6 message. We therefore analyzed whether the increased IL-6 mRNA levels coincided with enhanced IL-6 secretion. IL-6 protein levels in culture supernatants of lung fibroblasts treated with TGF-β1 for 12 h were measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay. As shown in Fig.1 B, the levels of IL-6 protein were similarly increased in a concentration-dependent manner as compared with controls. Unstimulated quiescent human lung fibroblasts secreted 260 ± 13 pg/ml of IL-6 protein within 12 h. IL-6 secretion increased to 886 ± 23 pg/ml in response to TGF-β1 at a concentration of 1 ng/ml (p < 0.001), corresponding to a 341% increase. When lung fibroblasts were stimulated with TGF-β1 at concentrations of 0.1 or 0.01 ng/ml, IL-6 protein concentrations in culture supernatants increased to 723 ± 43 pg/ml (278% increase) and 435 ± 23 pg/ml (167% increase), respectively (p< 0.001) (Fig. 1 B). We analyzed possible mechanisms underlying IL-6 up-regulation by TGF-β1 using luciferase reporter gene assays. We subcloned a 651-bp fragment of the human IL-6 promoter into a luciferase reporter gene vector to give the parental construct pIL6-luc651. As shown in Fig.2 A, TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) activated the parental pIL6-luc651 construct to 220 ± 12% of unstimulated controls (1162 ± 98 relative light units (RLU)versus 528 ± 25 RLU), when transiently transfected into human lung fibroblasts. Using TGF-β1 at a concentration of 0.1 ng/ml, IL-6 promoter activity was still increased by 258 ± 15% (1061 ± 85 versus 528 ± 25 RLU) (Fig.2 A). Inducibility of the IL-6 promoter decreased to 144 ± 11% when TGF-β1 was used at 0.01 ng/ml (760 ± 62versus 528 ± 25 RLU) (Fig. 2 A), thus reflecting the dose dependence observed on the mRNA and protein level. In order to identify cis-regulatory sequences that were responsible for the up-regulation of IL-6 expression by TGF-β1, we generated several deletion mutants of the parental pIL6-luc651 construct. Two deletion mutants were screened for their TGF-β1 inducibility and compared with the parental pIL6-luc651: (i) pIL6-luc220, deficient in a known AP-1 consensus sequence and (ii) pIL6-luc160, deficient in both a known AP-1 and a known CREB consensus sequence (see schematic diagram in Fig.2 B). As demonstrated in Fig. 2 B, IL-6 promoter inducibility by TGF-β1 was only observed with the parental pIL6-luc651, suggesting that the TGF-β1-responsivecis-regulatory sequences are located between nucleotides −651 to −220 of the IL-6 promoter. To further analyze this observation, we generated mutants of known consensus sequences within the IL-6 promoter by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 2 B). We tested the parental pIL6-luc651 with mutations in the AP-1 binding sequence, the C/EBP-β binding sequence, and the NF-κB binding sequence as well as a double mutant of the C/EBP-β and NF-κB sequence for their TGF-β1 inducibility. Interestingly, only the AP-1 mutant was found to lack TGF-β1 inducibility compared with the parental pIL6-luc651 (Fig.2 B). Neither the C/EBP-β, the NF-κB, nor the double mutant demonstrated loss of TGF-β1 inducibility as compared with the parental pIL6-luc651. Thus, the results obtained from luciferase assays strongly suggest that AP-1 is specifically required for TGF-β1-induced IL-6 gene expression in primary human lung fibroblasts. We assessed whether AP-1 is specifically activated by TGF-β1 by performing electrophoretic mobility shift analyses (EMSA) with nuclear extracts of TGF-β1-treated and -untreated control fibroblasts. Time course analyses with γ-32P-labeled oligonucleotides spanning the consensus sequences of transcription factors important for IL-6 promoter activity were performed. Fig. 3includes characteristic EMSA demonstrating time course analyses of the transcription factors AP-1 (Fig. 3 A), C/EBP-β (NF-IL-6) (Fig. 3 B), and NF-κB (Fig. 3 C) in nuclear extracts of fibroblasts treated with TGF-β1 at 2 ng/ml. Over a representative time course, only AP-1 DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts of TGF-β1-treated fibroblasts was significantly increased (Fig. 3 A); none of the aforementioned transcription factors were activated (Fig. 3, B and C). AP-1 activation increased as early as 30 min after stimulation with TGF-β1, peaked at 5 h, and returned to base-line levels over a time frame of 16 h (Fig. 3 A). Both C/EBP-β (Fig. 3 B) and NF-κB (Fig. 3 C) exhibited constitutive DNA binding in nuclear extracts of quiescent lung fibroblasts. However, in contrast to AP-1, neither of the two was affected by TGF-β1 treatment. To further demonstrate specificity of AP-1 activation, we also performed EMSA investigating the transcription factors Sp1 and CREB. Although Sp1 is reported to be activated by TGF-β1 in different cell types, none of these two transcription factors were induced by TGF-β1 in human lung fibroblasts (data not shown). AP-1 is a dimeric transcription factor that either consists of Jun homodimers or Jun/Fos heterodimers. We therefore analyzed the composition of the TGF-β1-induced AP-1 complex by supershift analyses with the addition of antibodies recognizing all Jun isoforms (pan-c-Jun/AP-1) or all Fos isoforms (pan-c-Fos). As demonstrated in Fig. 4 A, the antibody recognizing all Jun isoforms clearly diminished the appearance of the induced AP-1 complex, whereas the unspecific band was unaffected. In contrast, the antibody specific for all Fos isoforms did not cause a reduction of the specific AP-1 band, thereby suggesting the absence of Fos isoforms in this specific AP-1 complex in human lung fibroblasts. We further analyzed the AP-1 complex by using antibodies specific for distinct Jun isoforms (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD). As demonstrated in Fig.4 B, only the pan-c-Jun and the JunD antibody resulted in a significant decrease of the specific AP-1 band, thus suggesting the AP-1 complex to be a JunD homodimer. This was further confirmed by the fact that only these two antibodies resulted in a clear supershifted band. As a serum control, an antibody specific for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) supplied by the same manufacturer was used (Fig. 4 B). Since the addition of this antibody did not affect the specific band, unspecific effects of the antibodies used for supershift analyses can be reasonably excluded. Furthermore, the addition of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides diminished the appearance of the specific AP-1 band (Fig.4 B). TGF-βs play an essential role in the pathophysiology of lung fibrosis. They have been shown to be causally responsible for the changes associated with the fibroproliferative response in fibrotic lungs, such as fibroblast proliferation and increased extracellular matrix synthesis (28Gauldie J. Jordana M. Cox G. Thorax. 1993; 48: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 29Coker R.K. Laurent G.J. Eur. Respir. J. 1998; 11: 1218-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Studies investigating signal transduction by TGF-βs have thus far revealed several transcription factors that are activated upon stimulation with TGF-βs in a tissue- and cell type-specific manner (2Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar, 30Banerjee C. Stein J.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Frenkel B. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1991-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but although human lung fibroblasts are highly responsive to TGF-βs, signal transduction pathways activated by TGF-β in this cell type remain to be characterized. In this report, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of TGF-β1-induced IL-6 expression, a target gene known to be involved in fibroblast proliferation (18Roth M. Nauck M. Tamm M. Perruchoud A.P. Ziesche R. Block L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Bihl M. Tamm M. Nauck M. Wieland H. Perruchoud A.P. Roth M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Using cultures of primary human lung fibroblasts derived from different patients undergoing pneumectomy/lobectomy, we demonstrate that TGF-β1 is a potent inducer of IL-6 mRNA and protein expression in this cell type. Luciferase and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that the transcription factor AP-1 is required for the observed induction of IL-6 by TGF-β1. In human lung fibroblasts, none of the other transcription factors that have previously been reported to be activated by TGF-βs, such as Sp1, were affected in their DNA binding activity. Thus, these results strongly indicate that, in addition to its effect on IL-6 expression, AP-1 is a major signal transducer of TGF-β1 and is required for most of its biological effects in human lung fibroblasts. This notion is further strengthened by the fact that all results were obtained with fibroblast cultures derived from multiple patients, thus excluding genotype-specific effects and implicating a general role for AP-1 in the human lung. AP-1 is composed as a homodimer of Jun isoforms or as a heterodimer of Jun/Fos isoforms, both members of the immediate early gene family (31Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3237) Google Scholar,32Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). DNA binding of AP-1 occurs after activation and dimerization of the described isoforms. Interestingly, the specificity of biological effects induced by upstream stimuli is determined through the actual composition of AP-1 in a certain signal transduction cascade. In this respect, JunB-containing complexes are predominantly described to be negative regulators of AP-1 function and inhibit transcription by negative interaction with AP-1 consensus sequences (33Hsu J.C. Cressman D.E. Taub R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3789-3794PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, increased gene expression by AP-1 is mostly attributed to c-Jun-containing complexes. In our experiments, AP-1 was shown to up-regulate IL-6 expression, and the composition of AP-1 was unequivocally determined by supershift analyses with antibodies directed against distinct members of the Jun/Fos family. These supershift analyses revealed that the TGF-β1-induced AP-1 complex exclusively consisted of JunD homodimers, which have thus far not been described to be a dominant part of AP-1 in TGF-β signaling. Although several investigations have found AP-1 activation upon TGF-β treatment in different cell types (30Banerjee C. Stein J.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Frenkel B. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1991-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Tang W. Yang L. Yang Y.C. Leng S.X. Elias J.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31602-31606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), supershift analyses have revealed that, for the most part, c-Jun isoforms constituted these AP-1 complexes. Consistent with our results, Fos isoforms were generally not affected by TGF-β. In an elegant study, Mauviel and colleagues have described how TGF-β induces JunB in dermal fibroblasts, leading to decreased expression of the matrix metalloproteinase-1 gene (36Mauviel A. Chung K.Y. Agarwal A. Tamai K. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10917-10923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In the same study, the authors found that TGF-β up-regulated matrix metalloproteinase-1 expression in epidermal keratinocytes. In this cell type, the increase in matrix metalloproteinase-1 expression was mediated by c-Jun, thereby emphasizing the importance of different Jun isoforms in cell type-specific effects of TGF-β. Investigation of a different target gene, the matrix metalloproteinase-3 gene, revealed that up-regulation of this metalloproteinase by TGF-β was due to an AP-1 complex that consisted of c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunD (37Uria J.A. Jimenez M.G. Balbin M. Freije J.M.P. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9769-9777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Moreover, AP-1 has been found to transduce gene induction by TGF-βs in the cases of α2(I) collagen (10Chung K.Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3278Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), clusterin (38Jin G. Howe P.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31602-31606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and TGF-β1 (11Kim S.J. Angel P. Lafyatis R. Hattori K. Kim K.Y. Sporn M.B. Karin M. Roberts A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1492-1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) itself. In addition to AP-1, Sp1 is another major transcription factor frequently described as being activated by TGF-βs, as in the case of α1(I) collagen (40Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and p21 gene expression (41Datto M.B. Yu Y. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). We therefore determined the effects of TGF-β1 on Sp1 in human lung fibroblasts to assess specificity and to generate a more complete analysis of TGF-β1 signaling in this cell type. Although fetal human skin fibroblasts have been reported to activate Sp1 in response to TGF-β1 (40Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we did not detect any up-regulation of Sp1 in adult lung fibroblasts (data not shown). These different observations, however, may result (i) from the different tissue compartments from which fibroblasts were generated (skin versus lung) or (ii) from the fact that fetal fibroblasts react developmentally distinct from adult fibroblasts. Besides AP-1 and Sp1, we investigated activation of C/EBP-β, CREB, and NF-κB in this study, transcription factors known to be important in the regulation of IL-6 gene expression (20Akira S. Kishimoto T. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 127: 25-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 27Matsusaka T. Fujikawa K. Nishio Y. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10193-10197Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). None of these factors were affected by TGF-β1, and mutations of their respective consensus sequences within the IL-6 promoter did not affect IL-6 gene induction by TGF-β1. In our model, AP-1 was the only transcription factor of all those investigated found to be activated by TGF-β1 in adult human lung fibroblasts. Although these results imply that AP-1 is the immediate effector molecule of TGF-β1 signaling, we cannot exclude the possibility that other factors contribute to AP-1-driven gene expression in this model. In this respect, CBP/p300 or SMADs are of significant interest. In recent years, SMAD proteins have evolved as essential elements in TGF-β signaling (2Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar, 13Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Derynck R. Feng X.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F105-F150Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). They become phosphorylated and activated by ligand-bound TβR family members, associate in specific heterodimers, and translocate to the nucleus, where they control gene transcription. Interestingly, control of gene expression by SMADs is achieved either by association with already DNA-bound factors or by direct interaction with cis-regulatory elements (13Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 15Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Zhao Y. Young S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2369-2372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,42Janknecht R. Wells N.J. Hunter T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2114-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 43Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). SMADs have been found to potentiate AP-1-dependent gene transcription, but their precise nuclear function in this context remains unknown (15Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Zhao Y. Young S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2369-2372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, the contribution of SMADs in the described TGF-β1-induced transcriptional activation by AP-1 needs to be fully resolved. CBP/p300, in contrast, are coactivators that need to bind to activating transcription factors before potentiation of gene transcription can occur (44St-Arnaud R. Quelo I. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D838-D848Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). CBP is described to associate with AP-1 (45Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar), thereby leading to increased gene transcription that is controlled by AP-1 consensus sites within the promoter sequences investigated (44St-Arnaud R. Quelo I. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D838-D848Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 46Horvai A.E. Xu L. Korzus E. Brard G. Kalafus D. Mullen T.M. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that TGF-β1 may increase CBP activity or its association with AP-1, which would also lead to an increase in AP-1-driven gene transcription, as observed for IL-6 expression in the above described studies. Taken together, our findings thus underline the importance of AP-1 as a major mediator of TGF-β1 signaling in human lung fibroblasts. This can also apply to physiological and pathophysiological conditions in the lung in vivo, such as in diseases evoked by increased TGF-β expression. In lung fibrosis, fibroblasts are known to be the key cell type responsible for the transition toward a fibrotic extracellular matrix. In this disease, AP-1 inhibition with special regard to JunD might thus be of crucial importance toward the development of novel therapeutic strategies. We thank Drs. M. Centrella and T. McCarthy for stimulating discussions."
https://openalex.org/W3141883259,"Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-10, a homologue of FGF-7, is expressed significantly in normal rat prostate tissue, well differentiated rat prostate tumors with an epithelial and stromal compartment and only in derived prostate stromal cells in culture. Similar to FGF-7, recombinant rat FGF-10 was a specific mitogen for prostate epithelial cells. In contrast to FGF-7 which is widely expressed among stromal cells in tissues, the expression of FGF-10 correlated with the presence of stromal cells of muscle origin. Radioreceptor binding assays and covalent cross-linking analysis revealed that FGF-10 binds with an affinity equal to FGF-7 to resident epithelial cell receptor, FGFR2IIIb, but unlike FGF-7 also binds the IIIb splice variant of FGFR1. Analysis of mRNA expression by RNase protection revealed that, similar to FGF-7, the expression of FGF-10 was responsive to androgen in stromal cells from normal prostate and non-malignant differentiated tumors. Although FGF-10 cDNA exhibits a signal sequence for secretion, cultured stromal cells exhibit strictly a cell-associated FGF-10 antigen that correlates with an alternately translated intracellular isoform. FGF-10 requires 1.4 times higher NaCl for elution from immobilized heparin than does FGF-7 and binds to four times the number of sites on the pericellular matrix of epithelial cells. The results show that prostate stromal cell-derived FGF-10, like FGF-7, exhibits the properties of an andromedin which may indirectly mediate control of epithelial cell growth and function by androgen. Although FGF-10 and FGF-7 bind and activate the same resident epithelial cell receptor (FGFR2IIIb), differences in cell type of origin, compartmentation by alternate translation, the affinity for FGFR1IIIb, and access to FGFR by differential interaction with pericellular matrix heparan sulfate suggest they may play both independent and compensatory roles in prostate homeostasis. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-10, a homologue of FGF-7, is expressed significantly in normal rat prostate tissue, well differentiated rat prostate tumors with an epithelial and stromal compartment and only in derived prostate stromal cells in culture. Similar to FGF-7, recombinant rat FGF-10 was a specific mitogen for prostate epithelial cells. In contrast to FGF-7 which is widely expressed among stromal cells in tissues, the expression of FGF-10 correlated with the presence of stromal cells of muscle origin. Radioreceptor binding assays and covalent cross-linking analysis revealed that FGF-10 binds with an affinity equal to FGF-7 to resident epithelial cell receptor, FGFR2IIIb, but unlike FGF-7 also binds the IIIb splice variant of FGFR1.

FGF-1, which acts on FGFR isoforms that are both in epithelium and stroma, is expressed in both prostate compartments and expression increases with malignant progression (4Mansson P.E. Adams P. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 2485-2494PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-2, FGF-3, and FGF-5 are expressed ectopically in malignant epithelial cells (3Yan G. Fukabori Y. McBride G.

FGF-7, whose expression is limited to the stromal cells, is the androgen-responsive signal of a directionally specific paracrine communication system from stroma to epithelium in normal prostate and non-malignant differentiated tumors with a stromal compartment (3Yan G.

Kan M. McKeehan W.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5369-5378PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is thought that in the epithelial cell context, FGFR2 mediates a homeostatic balance through both positive and negative effects on population growth rates and differentiation. This is in contrast to FGFR1, which is a resident FGFR in stromal cells (6Feng S. Wang F. Matsubara A. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5369-5378PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we show that, similar to FGF-7, FGF-10 is expressed only in the stroma of normal prostate and differentiated prostate tumors, and that expression is sensitive to androgen. FGF-10 is a mitogen for isolated prostate epithelial cells, but not for stromal cells which express it, and binds specifically to the resident epithelial cell receptor, FGFR2IIIb. FGF-10 differs from FGF-7 by its more restricted expression pattern, the ability to bind FGFR1IIIb in addition to FGFR2IIIb, and in the interaction with heparin and pericellular matrix heparan sulfate.

https://openalex.org/W2027717176,"Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements across the New Madrid seismic zone (NMSZ) in the central United States show little, if any, motion. These data are consistent with platewide continuous GPS data away from the NMSZ, which show no motion within uncertainties. Both these data and the frequency-magnitude relation for seismicity imply that had the largest shocks in the series of earthquakes that occurred in 1811 and 1812 been magnitude 8, their recurrence interval should well exceed 2500 years, longer than has been assumed. Alternatively, the largest 1811 and 1812 earthquakes and those in the paleoseismic record may have been much smaller than typically assumed. Hence, the hazard posed by great earthquakes in the NMSZ appears to be overestimated."

We have recently demonstrated that lysophosphatidic acid and several other agonists stimulate phosphorylation of the Rac1-specific exchange factor Tiam1 in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, and that protein kinase C is involved in Tiam1 phosphorylation (Fleming, I.

We now show, through manipulation of intracellular [Ca2+] and the use of protein kinase inhibitors, that both protein kinase Cα and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II are involved in the phosphorylation of Tiam1 in vivo. Furthermore, we show that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylates Tiam1 in vitro, producing an electrophoretic retardation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Significantly, phosphorylation of Tiam1 by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, but not by protein kinase C, enhanced its nucleotide exchange activity toward Rac1, by approximately 2-fold. Furthermore, Tiam1 was preferentially dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 1 in vitro, and treatment with this phosphatase abolished the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activation of Tiam1.

Nucleotide exchange factors which act on Rho proteins contain two key conserved domains: a Dbl homology domain, which is believed to be responsible for catalyzing GDP/GTP exchange; and a pleckstrin homology domain, which seems to be important for cellular localization through interaction with lipids and/or proteins (14Cerione R.A.

In this study we demonstrate that Tiam1 is phosphorylated by several PKC isozymes in vitro, but is selectively phosphorylated by a classical PKC isoform, PKCα, when Swiss 3T3 cells are treated with LPA. In addition, we present strong evidence that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII) also phosphorylates Tiam1 in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts in response to LPA treatment and that this phosphorylation produces electrophoretic retardation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Finally, we show that phosphorylation of Tiam1 by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, but not protein kinase Cα, enhances its nucleotide exchange rate toward Rac1, and that this can be abrogated by treatment with protein phosphatase 1.

Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in HEPES-buffered DMEM with 4 mm l-glutamine supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were grown on 100-mm dishes for 1–2 days to subconfluence (60–70%). The medium was then replaced with a low serum medium (DMEM containing 1% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) for 24 h to allow the cells to become quiescent. The cells were then treated with serum-free medium (DMEM containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and antibiotics) for 1 h prior to agonist stimulation. Serum-starved cultures, on 100-mm dishes, were treated with various concentrations of LPA, PMA, or ionomycin at 37 °C for different times as noted in the experiments. The medium was removed, the cells washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 500 μm sodium orthovanadate, and scraped in 400 μl/dish of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml antipain and leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmpyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). The cells were lysed by five passes through a 27-gauge needle (28Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33067-33073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged at 120,000 ×g for 45 min to prepare cytosolic and total particulate fractions. The membrane pellet was washed twice with lysis buffer to remove cytosolic proteins. Protein determination was done by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). SDS-Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 6% or 4–12% gradient polyacrylamide gels (Novel Experimental Corp) and proteins transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) for 1.5 h at 20 V using a Novex wet transfer unit. The membranes were blocked overnight with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk. Blots were incubated for 1 h with Tiam1 antibody (diluted 1:2000) in 1% bovine serum albumin, then for 1 h with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories), prior to development using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Phosphothreonine Western blots were carried out essentially as described above, using a 1:500 primary antibody dilution. An N-terminally truncated form of Tiam1, GST-C1199-Tiam1 (16Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Ruuls-Van Stalle L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J.

Habets G.G.M. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), in the presence of 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Silver staining indicated that the purified GST-Tiam1 was almost homogeneous. Purified GST-Tiam1 (3 μl) was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in the presence or absence of 0.06 units of various purified PKC isozymes. Assays were carried out in 20 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.2, containing 25 mm glycerol 3-phosphate, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, 0.01 mg/ml diacylglycerol, 15 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 5 × 106 dpm/nmol) and phosphorylation analysis by autoradiography. Purified GST-Tiam1 (3 μl) was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in the presence or absence of the indicated amounts of purified CamKIIα. Assays were carried out in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 25 μg/ml calmodulin, 15 mm MgCl2 and 100 μm ATP. Assays were carried out either using non-radiolabeled ATP and phosphorylation analysis by Western blotting or with [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 5 × 106 dpm/nmol) and phosphorylation analysis by autoradiography. Since the purified Tiam1 preparations contained detergent and some aggregated protein, the concentration of purified Tiam1 was estimated from silver-stained gels for the stoichiometry experiments, using BSA as a standard. 0.2 pmol of GST-Tiam1 was phosphorylated by PKCα (0.3 units) or CamKIIα (4 μg), for 1 h in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 2 × 107dpm/nmol), as described above. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 6% gels, the Tiam1 band excised from the gel and 32P incorporation assessed by scintillation counting. Purified GST-Tiam1 (10 μl) was phosphorylated with PKCα (0.3 units) or CamKIIα (4 μg), for 1 h in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 2 × 107 dpm/nmol), as described above. Phosphorylated GST-Tiam1 was incubated with 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 30 °C, and the beads collected by centrifugation (3,000 × g for 5 min). The Tiam1-bound beads were washed three times with 200 μl of 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 mg/ml BSA to remove the kinase, resuspended in 50 μl of the same buffer, and stored on ice until use. Tiam1-bound beads (5 μl) were incubated with 0.3 units of purified protein phosphatase 1, 2A or 2B at 30 °C for 0 and 5 min. Protein phosphatase 1-catalyzed dephosphorylation was carried out in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 mg/ml BSA and 0.2 mm MnCl2. Protein phosphatase 2A was incubated with Tiam1 in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 mg/ml BSA. Protein phosphatase 2B-catalyzed dephosphorylation was carried out in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 20 μg/ml calmodulin, and 1 mmCaCl2. The samples were separated by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels and Tiam1 dephosphorylation analyzed by autoradiography. C1199-Tiam1 with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag was expressed in sf9 cells and purified using Talon metal affinity resin (CLONTECH) in a 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 μmβ-mercaptoethanol and 100 mm NaCl. Tiam1 was eluted from the beads using 100 mm imidazole and dialyzed prior to freezing. GST-Rac1 was expressed in E. coli, and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads in a 100 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 250 mm NaCl and 0.1 mmdithiothreitol. GST-Rac1 was eluted from the beads with 10 mm glutathione, dialyzed, and frozen. The Tiam1 exchange assay was carried out essentially as described (15Michiels F. Habets G.G.M. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Purified GST-Rac1 (120 pmol) was preloaded with [3H]GDP (30 μm; 25 Ci/mmol) in 60 μl of binding buffer. Eight μl of the preloaded GTPase was added to 32 μl of exchange mixture, which contained 5 pmol of Tiam1 or BSA, 1 mm GTP, and 75 μm PIP3, in exchange buffer (15Michiels F. Habets G.G.M. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). At the indicated times, 8-μl aliquots were pipetted into 1 ml stopping buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaCl), and [3H]GDP bound to Rac1 analyzed by filtering through nitrocellulose. For some exchange experiments, Tiam1 (5 pmol) was prephosphorylated with 0.1 units of protein kinase C or 2 μg of CamKII, as described above. In some experiments Tiam1 was assayed after prephosphorylation with 2 μg of CamKII in the presence or absence of 0.2 units of PP1. In Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, LPA stimulates threonine phosphorylation of Tiam1 through activation of PKC, and causes its electrophoretic retardation on SDS-PAGE (26Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Collard J.G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33105-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To understand further the mechanism of Tiam1 phosphorylation, we incubated purified GST-C1199-Tiam1 with several PKC isozymes to determine which isoform(s) phosphorylates the exchange factor. As shown in Fig.1, all of the kinases tested phosphorylate Tiam1, indicating that PKC isozymes of the classical, novel, and atypical families can phosphorylate the protein in vitro. However, the different PKC isoforms phosphorylated Tiam1 to different extents. The exchange factor was preferentially phosphorylated by PKCα, -γ, and -ζ, moderately phosphorylated by PKCε, and only weakly phosphorylated by PKCβ1, -β2, and -δ. Significantly, none of the PKC isozymes tested decreased the electrophoretic mobility of Tiam1, suggesting that this was probably caused by a kinase from a different family in vivo. Down-regulation of non-atypical PKC isozymes by long term PMA pretreatment, or preincubation with the protein kinase C inhibitor Ro-31-8220, reduces LPA- or platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated Tiam1 phosphorylation by approximately 75% in Swiss 3T3 cells (26Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Collard J.G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33105-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 27Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M Exton J.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) suggesting that another protein kinase is also involved. Therefore, purified GST-C1199-Tiam1 was incubated with Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII), a kinase with a very broad substrate specificity and widespread expression (30Fujisawa H. BioEssays. 1990; 12: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), to determine whether this kinase phosphorylated the exchange factor. Although some phosphorylation of Tiam1 was observed in the absence of CamKII (Fig.2 A), perhaps due to a protein kinase which co-purifies with the GST-Tiam1 (26Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Collard J.G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33105-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), addition of the kinase significantly enhanced 32P phosphorylation of the exchange factor (Fig. 2 A), demonstrating that this kinase can phosphorylate Tiam1. Indeed, Western blotting with antibodies confirmed that CamKII stimulated phosphorylation of Tiam1 on threonine (Fig. 2 B). Significantly, in addition to phosphorylating Tiam1, CamKII induced electrophoretic retardation of the exchange factor (Fig. 2), such as is observed upon stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with LPA (26Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Collard J.G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33105-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II induced the Tiam1 bandshift in a concentration-dependent (Fig. 2 B) and time-dependent (Fig. 2 C) manner, but only in the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin (data not shown). Intriguingly, the Tiam1 bandshift occurred in a gradual manner with time, and not as one step, suggesting that the exchange factor probably exists in several different phosphorylation states and has multiple phosphorylation sites which serve as substrates for CamKII. Indeed, when the Tiam1 protein concentration was estimated by silver staining, using BSA as a standard, stoichiometry experiments indicated that under maximal phosphorylating conditions, Tiam1 contains 10.1 ± 2.7 PKCα and 3.7 ± 0.6 CamKII phosphorylation sites. Swiss 3T3 cells were stimulated with LPA, in the presence and absence of the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA/AM, to investigate the importance of this metal ion in Tiam1 phosphorylation. The results (Fig. 3 A) show that Tiam1 phosphorylation is totally abolished in the presence of the chelator, indicating that Ca2+ plays an essential role in this pathway. Together with the results obtained using protein kinase inhibitors, and PKC down-regulation (26Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Collard J.G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33105-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), this suggests that LPA stimulates Tiam1 phosphorylation through activation of a classical PKC isoform and another Ca2+-dependent enzyme. Therefore, since Swiss 3T3 cells only contain PKCα, -δ, -ε, and -ζ (31Olivier A.R. Parker P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), LPA must stimulate Tiam1 phosphorylation through activation of PKCα, which is the only classical Ca2+-dependent enzyme present. Significantly, BAPTA treatment also inhibited the LPA-stimulated Tiam1 bandshift (Fig.3 B), indicating that Ca2+ is required for this effect. However, the selective PKC inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide I (Fig. 3 C) and Ro-31-8220 (data not shown) had no effect on the LPA-induced Tiam1 bandshift, providing further evidence that PKC does not cause this. To confirm that CamKII is involved in LPA-induced Tiam1 phosphorylation, Swiss 3T3 cells were preincubated with the CamKII inhibitor KN93 (20 μm) for 24 h, in the presence and absence of the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 (5 μm) for 1 h. As expected (26Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Collard J.G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33105-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), Ro-31-8220 greatly reduced LPA-stimulated Tiam1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 D). KN93 also significantly reduced LPA-induced Tiam1 phosphorylation, and the two inhibitors together almost completely eliminated the phosphorylation (Fig. 3 D). Therefore, these data strongly suggest that CamKII and PKC both contribute to the phosphorylation studied here. To provide additional evidence that PKCα and CamKII phosphorylate Tiam1 in vivo, Swiss 3T3 cells were treated with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, in the presence and absence of PMA. PMA (1 μm) alone induced limited threonine phosphorylation of Tiam1 (Fig. 3 E; Ref. 26Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Collard J.G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33105-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Ionomycin (1 μm) alone stimulated Tiam1 phosphorylation to a greater extent (Fig. 3 E), and enhanced the PMA-stimulated Tiam1 phosphorylation. Similar results were obtained with the ionophore A23187 (data not shown). Therefore, the observation that PMA and a Ca2+ ionophore are sufficient to stimulate Tiam1 phosphorylation is consistent with a classical PKC isozyme and CamKII phosphorylating the exchange factor in vivo. We have previously established that LPA-stimulated Tiam1 phosphorylation is maximal at 2.5 min, begins to decrease after 10 min LPA treatment, but is still readily detectable after 60 min of LPA treatment (26Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Collard J.G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33105-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Further experiments showed that Tiam1 phosphorylation was still detectable after 3 h of LPA treatment, but that the stimulation was lost after 4 h (data not shown), presumably because of dephosphorylation. To elucidate further the mechanisms involved in controlling the level of Tiam1 phosphorylation, we investigated which phosphatases are involved in the dephosphorylation process. The results show that Tiam1 is preferentially dephosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of PP1in vitro, when the exchange factor is phosphorylated by PKCα or CamKII (Fig. 4). Tiam1 was also dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 2B in vitro, but at a much slower rate (Fig. 4). Interestingly, protein phosphatase 2A slowly dephosphorylated Tiam1 when it was phosphorylated by CamKII, but not when it was phosphorylated by PKCα. Since Tiam1 acts as a Rac1-specific exchange factor in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, stimulating membrane ruffling and Jun kinase activity (15Michiels F. Habets G.G.M. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A.

Purified hexahistidine-tagged Tiam1 protein was incubated with ATP in the presence or absence of purified CamKII, and the GDP/GTP exchange rate of Tiam1 assessed by following the dissociation of [3H]GDP from Rac1. As expected (15Michiels F. Habets G.G.M. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), Tiam1"

However, independent of thrombolysis, tPA may also have deleterious effects on neurons by promoting excitotoxicity. Zinc neurotoxicity has been shown to be an additional key mechanism in brain injuries. Hence, if tPA affects zinc neurotoxicity, this may provide additional insights into its effect on neuronal death. Independent of its proteolytic action, tPA markedly attenuated zinc-induced cell death in cortical culture, and, when injected into cerebrospinal fluid, also reduced kainate seizure-induced hippocampal neuronal death in adult rats."

In particular, we evaluated MKP-1 and -2 as possible contributors to this inhibitory activity, as they are widely expressed immediate-early gene products that are induced by a variety of stimuli (23Hirsch D.D.

Here, we report that hypoxia transiently induces SAPK/JNK as well as p38 MAPK activity in SiHa cells, and concurrently induces a SAPK/JNK phosphatase activity. This transient induction of SAPK/JNK activity correlates with both the transcriptional activation of the gene for the MKP family member MKP-1 and the enhanced expression of MKP-1 mRNA. The hypoxia-inducible expression of MKP-1 mRNA is reversible, returning to the aerobic level on reoxygenation. Together, these findings show that MKP-1 is a hypoxia-responsive phosphatase and imply that it contributes to the attenuation of SAPK/JNK activity stimulated in hypoxic cells. In the context of tumor biology, the poised and reversible responses of these MKP and MAPK pathways to hypoxic signals suggest that they are tightly regulated within the tumor microenvironment. The GST-ATF2-(1–94) fusion protein was expressed from a pGEX-KG plasmid (obtained from Dr. John Kyriakis, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA), and the GST-c-Jun-(1–141) fusion protein was expressed from a pGEX-2T plasmid (obtained from Dr. James Woodgett, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Ontario). Mammalian expression vectors (pcDNAIII) for full-length mouse MKP-1 and rat MKP-2 cDNAs are described elsewhere (26Misra-Press A. Rim C.S. Yao H. Roberson M.S. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol.

The following antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA): rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse p38 MAPK antibody (p38 (C-20); cross-reactive with human p38 MAPK), rabbit polyclonal SAPKγ/JNK1 antibody (JNK1 (FL); immunizing antigen full-length recombinant human JNK1; cross-reactive with p54 SAPKα2/JNK2 and SAPKβ/JNK3), monoclonal anti-p46 SAPKγ/JNK1 antibody (JNK1 (F-3); immunizing antigen full-length recombinant human JNK1), rabbit polyclonal anti-SAPKα/JNK2 (JNK2 (FL); immunizing antigen full-length recombinant human JNK2; cross-reactive with p46 SAPKγ/JNK1 and SAPKβ/JNK3), and monoclonal anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK antibody (p-JNK (G-7); immunizing antigen amino acids 183–191 of human SAPKγ/JNK1 phosphorylated on Thr-183 and Tyr-185; identical with the corresponding region of phosphorylated human SAPKα/JNK2). The SiHa human cervical carcinoma cell line was acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Details of the preparation and treatment of SiHa cultures have been described elsewhere (5Ausserer W.A. Bourrat-Floeck B. Green C.J. Laderoute K.R. Sutherland R.M. Mol. Cell.

Because our system for exposing cell cultures to hypoxia creates defined atmospheric oxygen partial pressure (pO2) values within the range of approximately 1% to ≤0.01% (relative to air at approximately 21%), we define the low oxygen conditions used for these studies as hypoxia, not anoxia. These conditions simulate those detectable in hypoxic regions of solid tumors and in solid tumor models (3Graeber T. Osmanian C. Jacks T. Housman D. Koch C. Lowe S. Giaccia A.

The hypoxia experiments described in this study were all performed at pO2 ≤ 0.01%. SiHa cells were plated at 106cells/60-mm diameter glass culture dish in Eagle's basal medium containing 10% bovine calf serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KN) and 25 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), and incubated in a 5% CO2/air atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were incubated for 3 days after plating before exposure to hypoxia. Briefly, aluminum gas-exchange chambers containing the cells were placed in a 37 °C circulating water bath and the original atmosphere was repeatedly exchanged with 5% CO2/95% N2 by using a manifold equipped with a vacuum pump and a gas cylinder (5Ausserer W.A. Bourrat-Floeck B. Green C.J. Laderoute K.R. Sutherland R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5032-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Atmospheric oxygen levels in this apparatus were calibrated by using a polarographic oxygen electrode (Oxygen Sensors, Inc., Norristown, PA) in an attached test chamber. At the completion of various hypoxic exposure times, the chambers were opened in an anaerobic box (Bactron X, Sheldon Manufacturing Inc., Cornelius, OR) maintained at 5% CO2/balance N2 to prepare cell lysates without significant reoxygenation. For reoxygenation experiments, hypoxic cells were incubated in 5% CO2/air. Based on the criterion of trypan blue exclusion, these hypoxic exposures had no acute toxicity for the cells used in these studies. In addition, clonogenic assays have shown that prolonged hypoxia (pO2 ≤ 0.01% for up to 16 h) is not significantly toxic to SiHa cells (29Laderoute K.R. Grant T.D. Murphy B.J. Sutherland R.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 42: 1-5Google Scholar). The hypoxic exposures used for these studies also do not deplete total ATP levels in SiHa cells. 2K. R. Laderoute, H. L. Mendonca, J. M. Calaoagan, and A. M. Knapp, unpublished data. ATF2 and c-Jun kinase activities in cell lysates were assayed by using appropriate GST fusion proteins of ATF2 or c-Jun transactivation domains as substrates (GST-ATF2-(1–94) or GST-c-Jun-(1–141)) (13Laderoute K.R.

Briefly, the fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coliBL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA), and the cells were suspended in PBS-T (20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmPMSF, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmbenzamidine hydrochloride, 100 μmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF). The bacterial cells were lysed by subjecting them to three freeze/thaw cycles followed by sonication. The fusion protein was extracted by adding suspensions of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) to samples of the cleared bacterial lysates and then tumbling the mixtures overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with ice-cold PBS-T. Following a hypoxic treatment, plates of cells were immediately placed on ice in air or on Super Ice® cold packs in the anaerobic box and the medium was removed. Each dish was washed with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS before adding 1 ml of ice-cold lysis solution (0.1 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 100 μmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF). These solutions were degassed before harvesting protein from hypoxic cells. The plates were scraped, and the resultant cell suspensions were disrupted in ice-cold Dounce homogenizers. The disrupted cell mixtures were transferred to gasket-cap microcentrifuge tubes for spinning at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined by a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce), and the concentrations were normalized with lysis buffer. The kinase assays were performed by first adding suspensions of Sepharose beads with adducted GST fusion protein to tubes of supernatant fractions containing 100 μg of cell protein. The tubes were gently rotated at 4 °C for 1 h, spun at 11,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C, and washed four times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS-T. The PBS-T was removed from the beads, and 20 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 0.4 mm ATP) and 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to initiate each reaction. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, and the reactions were stopped by adding 40 μl of a 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4.6% SDS, 10% mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol) and boiling for 5 min. Samples were resolved in 12% discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gels and the gels were stained with colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 to confirm equal protein loading. The gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR film to prepare autoradiographs. Densitometry was performed by using a Lynx video densitometer (Applied Imaging Corp., Santa Clara, CA). To perform these assays the medium was removed from the cells in air or in the anaerobic box, as described above. After washing with ice-cold PBS, each dish of cells received 500 μl of ice-cold detergent lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 137 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The cells were lysed by scraping and the suspensions were transferred to gasket-cap microcentrifuge tubes for spinning at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined by a BCA assay, and the concentrations were normalized with the lysis buffer. Each lysate was precleared by adding 60 μl of Protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and tumbling for at least 1 h at 4 °C. The lysates were spun at 600 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min, and each lysate was normalized to 100 or 200 μg of total protein and divided into two equal samples. One sample received an amount of a specific antibody (3 μg of anti-p38 MAPK antibody; 1 μg of anti-SAPK/JNK antibody), and the other sample was used as a control for nonspecific protein binding to the Protein A/G Plus-agarose beads. Each sample then received 20 μl of the agarose beads and was gently tumbled for at least 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were spun at 600 × g at 4 °C for 10 min and washed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer and three times with ice-cold kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 25 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4). The kinase buffer was removed, and 5 μg of substrate was added to each sample followed by 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μm ATP and 3–5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, and the reactions were stopped by adding 40 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were resolved in 10% or 12% discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and relative kinase activities were determined as described above. To obtain total cellular lysates for detecting SAPK/JNK or p38 MAPK protein, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in the ice-cold detergent buffer used for the immunocomplex kinase assays. The lysates were frozen in dry ice and stored at −80 °C. Frozen lysates were thawed on ice and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The protein concentrations of the supernatants were measured by a BCA assay. Equal protein samples (5–10 μg) for gel electrophoresis were diluted with equal volumes of the 2× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were resolved in discontinuous 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted in a buffer containing 24 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, and 15% methanol onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore, Marlborough, MA) by using a TR 70 Semiphor semidry transfer unit (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). Blots were incubated in 1% nonfat dried milk at 4 °C overnight and then incubated at room temperature for 2 h with the anti-SAPK/JNK or the anti-p38 MAPK antibodies used for the immunocomplex kinase assays diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 5% horse serum. Antibody binding was detected by using a biotin-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), streptavidin alkaline phosphatase (Vector), and the substrates nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Life Technologies, Inc.). Alternatively, binding was detected by using an IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (IgG-HRP; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:10,000 in PBS/0.1% Tween 20, and the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Aerobic and hypoxic SiHa cells were placed on ice in air or on Super Ice® cold packs in the anaerobic box, and the medium was removed. Each dish was washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm Na3VO4and 50 mm NaF, and then 200 μl of ice-cold lysis solution (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 μm okadaic acid, 1 mm PMSF) were added. Degassed solutions were used with hypoxic cells. The plates were scraped, and the resultant cell suspensions were transferred to gasket-cap microcentrifuge tubes for spinning at 15,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples of the lysates were treated with 10 mm iodoacetamide for 15 min to remove DTT before measuring protein concentrations by a BCA assay. The protein concentrations were normalized by dilution with the lysis buffer, and samples containing 500 μg of total protein in a total volume of 600 μl were prepared by adding the lysis buffer used for the ATF2 and c-Jun kinase assays. Suspensions (40 μl) of Sepharose beads with adducted GST-ATF2-(1–94) fusion protein were added to the lysates, and they were gently rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. Then the lysates were spun at 13,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C, washed four times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS-T, diluted with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were resolved in discontinuous 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted as described above. Blots were blocked in 4% nonfat dried milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 at 4 °C for 1 h and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK antibody diluted 1:1,000 in PBS/0.1% Tween 20. Antibody binding was detected by using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system, as described above (the anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was diluted 1:10,000 in PBS/0.1% Tween 20). Purification of total cellular RNA for Northern analysis was performed by using the Trizol®reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) or the RNeasy method (Qiagen Inc., Santa Clarita, CA) according to the manufacturers' instructions. RNA was resolved in 1% denaturing agarose gels and blotted onto Magna NT nylon membranes (MSI, Westboro, MA), as described elsewhere (29Laderoute K.R. Grant T.D. Murphy B.J. Sutherland R.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 42: 1-5Google Scholar). A 1.9-kilobase pair MKP-1 cDNA probe was prepared by digestion of pcDNAIII/MKP-1 with HindIII and BamHI, and a 2.4-kilobase pair MKP-2 cDNA probe was prepared by digestion of pcDNAIII/MKP-2 with EcoRV. The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by the random primer method. To provide a normalization standard for RNA loading, ethidium bromide fluorescence from the 28 S rRNA band of total RNA was photographed or blots were stripped and probed with a DNA oligomer corresponding to a human 28 S rRNA sequence (CLONTECH) end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Exposure of control cells to UV radiation involved using a 254-nm wavelength source (UV-C) at a calibrated fluence of 40 J/m2 (31Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). UV-treated cells were harvested for RNA 1 h after exposure. The half-life of MKP-1 mRNA was determined according to a protocol described elsewhere (5Ausserer W.A. Bourrat-Floeck B. Green C.J. Laderoute K.R. Sutherland R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5032-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, SiHa cells were exposed to hypoxia for 4 h or to UV, as described above. Hypoxic cells were removed from the aluminum hypoxia chambers in the anaerobic box held at 37 °C. Both hypoxic and UV-treated cells were given 5 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma) for 10 min (time zero), and then cells were harvested for total RNA at various times afterward. Total RNA was processed for Northern analysis, and MKP-1 mRNA signals on the blots were measured by using a phosphorimager (Storm 840, Molecular Dynamics, Santa Clara, CA). The half-lives of MKP-1 mRNA were calculated from plots of the natural log (intensity) against the time of actinomycin D exposure starting at time zero. This assay is a modification of a protocol described elsewhere (5Ausserer W.A. Bourrat-Floeck B. Green C.J. Laderoute K.R. Sutherland R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5032-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For each experimental condition, eight dishes of SiHa cells were plated at 2 × 106 cells/100-mm diameter plastic culture dish 4 days before treatment. To harvest nuclei, dishes were placed on ice, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS followed by scraping in 800 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). After removal of the original lysate, each dish was washed with another 800 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer and the combined suspensions were kept on ice. The lysates were spun at 500 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and the nuclear pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer. After another spin at 500 × g, each pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol) and frozen in liquid N2. To perform nuclear runoff transcription reactions, each sample of frozen nuclei was thawed at room temperature and added to 200 μl of 2× reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT; 1 mm each of ATP, CTP, and GTP; 25 units/ml RNase inhibitor; Life Technologies, Inc.). Then 10 μl of 10 mCi/ml [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to each sample, and the samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by digestion with 10 μg of RNase-free DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 30 °C for 5 min. Nascent RNA samples were harvested and purified by the RNeasy® method (Midi Kit, Qiagen). Nylon membrane (MSI) slot blots of 250 ng each of MKP-1, β-actin, and pBluescript II KS+ (pBSK; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) cDNA were prepared by using a Hoefer PR 648 slot blot filtration manifold according to the manufacturer's instructions. The MKP-1 and β-actin cDNAs were inserts in pBSK, and the plasmids were linearized before blotting. Membranes were prehybridized at 42 °C for at least 4 h in 4× Denhardt's solution containing 1 μg/mlSaccharomyces cerevisiae tRNA, and hybridized at 42 °C for 36–48 h with 1–5 × 106 cpm of nascent RNA in 50% formamide hybridization solution (10 mm TES (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.4% SDS, 2 units/ml RNase inhibitor). After hybridization, the membranes were washed twice at 42 °C for 1 h with buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA), and then once at 42 °C for 30 min in buffer B (5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.4% SDS). The blots were then washed twice in buffer A and incubated at 37 °C in buffer A containing 10 mg/ml RNase A. After washing the membranes in buffer A twice at 42 °C for 1 h, they were exposed to Kodak BioMax x-ray film for autoradiography. Previously, we reported that exposure of SiHa cells to a range of low oxygen conditions (pO2 ≤ 0.1%) without reoxygenation caused transcriptional activation of c-jun (5Ausserer W.A. Bourrat-Floeck B.

As mentioned above, the c-jun promoter is sensitive to activation by both SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPK members of the MAPK superfamily (15Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol.

Although pharmacological studies suggested that different TxA2 receptors (TPs) are expressed in different cell types or even in a single cell (2Halushka P.V. Allan C.J. Davis-Bruno K.L. J.

Recently, a high molecular weight G protein, Gh, has been identified and cloned (26Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.J. Graham R.M.

Gh may be activated via the α1B and α1D adrenoreceptor isoforms; this subtype specificity involves determinants in their third intracellular loops (27Im J.M. Graham R.M. J. Biol.

Im M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27058-27062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) that has been identified as the PLCδ1 subtype (30Feng J.F. Rhee S.G. Im M.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27058-27062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Gh may also function as a tissue transglutaminase. The capacity of Ghto function as a transglutaminase varies inversely with GTP bindingin vitro. However, the relevance of this “switch” function to the role of Gh in vivo is unknown. Indeed, the role of Gh as a G protein has remained controversial. This results in part from the restriction of studies of its G protein function to a single receptor subfamily. Given our prior copurification of the platelet TP with a high molecular weight G protein, we have sought evidence for the association of this receptor with Gh. We report that Gh is present in cardiovascular cells that express both TP isoforms and that either may be immunoprecipitated with Gh. However, whereas both isoforms signal via Gq, only TPα signals via Gh to activate PLC-dependent inositol phosphate formation.DISCUSSIONGh is a newly characterized high molecular weight G protein that can be activated via the α1 adrenoreceptor (27Im J.M. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18944-18951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Chen S. Lin F. Iismaa S. Lee K.N. Birckbichler J. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32385-32391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We have previously found that human platelet TPs, purified roughly 2,000-fold, were associated with an uncharacterized G protein of a similar, high (∼70 kDa) molecular mass (25Moran N. FitzGerald G.A. Circulation. 1990; 82 Suppl. 3 (abstr.): 461Google Scholar). Given these observations, we decided to address the possibility that TPs might actually transmit intracellular signals via Gh. Furthermore, given the uncertain role of the TP isoforms, we sought to investigate whether they might couple with differential affinity to either Gh or Gqα. Gh is expressed in cells of the cardiovascular system which express TPs. Thus, platelets express message for both isoforms, although they appear to translate only TPα (43Habib A. FitzGerald G.A. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2645-2651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Vascular smooth muscle cells express both isoforms, whereas endothelial cells appear to express only TPβ (8Raychowdhury M.K. Yukawa M. Collins L.J. McGrail S.H. Kent K.C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (Correction (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 7011): 19256-19261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of these cell types, as well as megakaryocytic cell lines, express Gh.Both TP isoforms physically associate with Gh, as reflected by studies involving co-immunoprecipitation. Thus, immunoblotting of samples from lysates of COS-7 cells transfected with rat Gh, together with TPα or TPβ, demonstrated that Ghimmunoprecipitates with either isoform. Similar results were obtained in HEL and HASMC, cells in which the proteins were not overexpressed. These results are consistent with our earlier finding that a high molecular weight G protein copurifies with platelet TPs (presumably TPα). Stimulation of the cells with TP agonists, which promote receptor-G protein coupling, was not required for this association. However, this is unsurprising. Precedent for co-immunoprecipitation of receptors and G proteins in non-stimulated cells has already been established (44Lee M.J. Evans M. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11272-11279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 45Okuma Y. Reisine T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14826-14831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the affinity of TPs for Ghseems to be high. For example, immunoprecipitation of Ghwith TPs occurs even when using a lysate of COS-7 cells overexpressing Gh but not the receptors. COS-7 cells express low levels of endogenous TPs, which can be detected by RT-PCR, but not by binding of the TP antagonist [3H]SQ29,548. To address the specificity of the co-immunoprecipitation of Gh with TPs, we sought to replicate these findings using an antibody directed against rhodopsin. Rhodopsin is expressed specifically in retina and is absent from COS-7, HEL, or HASM cells. Gh did not immunoprecipitate with either the anti-rhodopsin Ab or with the IgG fraction of the normal rabbit serum used for the preclearing step. Thus, immunoprecipitation of Gh with TPα and TPβ appears to reflect a specific interaction.To address the possibility that the TP-Gh association is of functional relevance, we utilized transfected COS-7 cells (14Wu D. Jiang H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9828-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 40Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I.

Biochem. 1995; 228: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) measuring inositol phosphate production as an index of G protein-dependent PLC activation. Dose-dependent stimulation of inositol phosphate production was observed in response to agonist in cells transfected with either isoform alone, whereas cotransfection of the cells with Gqα amplified the response to agonist. By contrast, cotransfection with Gsα had no effect, as expected. Similar to our observation with Gqα, cotransfection of Gh with TPα enhanced the agonist-dependent increase in inositol phosphate formation over that found in cells transfected with TPα alone. By contrast, a similar effect was not observed in cells transfected with TPβ.The role of Gh as a conventional G protein has remained controversial, in part reflecting the restriction of evidence to a single subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors, the α adrenoreceptors. We now provide evidence for association of this protein with a distinct receptor, the TP, a member of the eicosanoid receptor subfamily. Gh also functions as a tissue transglutaminase, and it is now recognized that it binds and cross-links only specific substrates that may be relevant to cell death and survival (46Melino G. Piacentini M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Interestingly, its transglutaminase function varies inversely with its binding of GTP (26Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the switch between these functions might be relevant to cellular survival. We have shown that TP isoforms are expressed with Gh in cardiovascular cells and associate with this protein. However, their differential ability to signal via Ghprovides the first suggestion of distinct roles for these receptor isoforms in vivo.

Although pharmacological studies suggested that different TxA2 receptors (TPs) are expressed in different cell types or even in a single cell (2Halushka P.V. Allan C.J. Davis-Bruno K.L. J.

We have previously found that human platelet TPs, purified roughly 2,000-fold, were associated with an uncharacterized G protein of a similar, high (∼70 kDa) molecular mass (25Moran N. FitzGerald G.A. Circulation. 1990; 82 Suppl. 3 (abstr.): 461Google Scholar). Given these observations, we decided to address the possibility that TPs might actually transmit intracellular signals via Gh. Furthermore, given the uncertain role of the TP isoforms, we sought to investigate whether they might couple with differential affinity to either Gh or Gqα. Gh is expressed in cells of the cardiovascular system which express TPs. Thus, platelets express message for both isoforms, although they appear to translate only TPα (43Habib A. FitzGerald G.A.

All of these cell types, as well as megakaryocytic cell lines, express Gh.Both TP isoforms physically associate with Gh, as reflected by studies involving co-immunoprecipitation. Thus, immunoblotting of samples from lysates of COS-7 cells transfected with rat Gh, together with TPα or TPβ, demonstrated that Ghimmunoprecipitates with either isoform. Similar results were obtained in HEL and HASMC, cells in which the proteins were not overexpressed. These results are consistent with our earlier finding that a high molecular weight G protein copurifies with platelet TPs (presumably TPα). Stimulation of the cells with TP agonists, which promote receptor-G protein coupling, was not required for this association. However, this is unsurprising. Precedent for co-immunoprecipitation of receptors and G proteins in non-stimulated cells has already been established (44Lee M.J. Evans M. Hla T. J. Biol.

For example, immunoprecipitation of Ghwith TPs occurs even when using a lysate of COS-7 cells overexpressing Gh but not the receptors. COS-7 cells express low levels of endogenous TPs, which can be detected by RT-PCR, but not by binding of the TP antagonist [3H]SQ29,548. To address the specificity of the co-immunoprecipitation of Gh with TPs, we sought to replicate these findings using an antibody directed against rhodopsin. Rhodopsin is expressed specifically in retina and is absent from COS-7, HEL, or HASM cells. Gh did not immunoprecipitate with either the anti-rhodopsin Ab or with the IgG fraction of the normal rabbit serum used for the preclearing step. Thus, immunoprecipitation of Gh with TPα and TPβ appears to reflect a specific interaction.To address the possibility that the TP-Gh association is of functional relevance, we utilized transfected COS-7 cells (14Wu D.

Dose-dependent stimulation of inositol phosphate production was observed in response to agonist in cells transfected with either isoform alone, whereas cotransfection of the cells with Gqα amplified the response to agonist. By contrast, cotransfection with Gsα had no effect, as expected. Similar to our observation with Gqα, cotransfection of Gh with TPα enhanced the agonist-dependent increase in inositol phosphate formation over that found in cells transfected with TPα alone. By contrast, a similar effect was not observed in cells transfected with TPβ.The role of Gh as a conventional G protein has remained controversial, in part reflecting the restriction of evidence to a single subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors, the α adrenoreceptors. We now provide evidence for association of this protein with a distinct receptor, the TP, a member of the eicosanoid receptor subfamily. Gh also functions as a tissue transglutaminase, and it is now recognized that it binds and cross-links only specific substrates that may be relevant to cell death and survival (46Melino G. Piacentini M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Interestingly, its transglutaminase function varies inversely with its binding of GTP (26Nakaoka H. Perez D.M.

We have shown that TP isoforms are expressed with Gh in cardiovascular cells and associate with this protein. However, their differential ability to signal via Ghprovides the first suggestion of distinct roles for these receptor isoforms in vivo. Gh is a newly characterized high molecular weight G protein that can be activated via the α1 adrenoreceptor (27Im J.M. Graham R.M. J. Biol.

The availability of multiple pathways may permit some cell types to divert proteins to specialized compartments, such as the melanosome of pigmented cells. To address this issue, we characterized sorting determinants of tyrosinase, a tissue-specific resident protein of the melanosome. The cytoplasmic domain of tyrosinase was both necessary and sufficient for internalization and steady state localization to late endosomes and lysosomes in HeLa cells. Mutagenesis of two leucine residues within a conventional di-leucine motif ablated late endosomal localization. However, the properties of this di-leucine-based signal were distinguished from that of CD3γ by overexpression studies; overexpression of the tyrosinase signal, but not the well characterized CD3γ signal, induced a 4-fold enlargement of late endosomes and lysosomes and interfered with endosomal sorting mediated by both tyrosine- and other di-leucine-based signals. These properties suggest that the tyrosinase and CD3γ di-leucine signals are distinctly recognized and sorted by distinct pathways to late endosomes in non-pigmented cells. We speculate that melanocytic cells utilize the second pathway to divert proteins to the melanosome.

We speculate that melanocytic cells utilize the second pathway to divert proteins to the melanosome. The maintenance of morphological and functional integrity of individual compartments of the secretory and endosomal pathways requires proper sorting of integral membrane components. Eukaryotic cells have evolved mechanisms to divert specific integral membrane protein components from several sites into tubular and/or vesicular carriers destined for late endosomes and lysosomes (reviewed in Refs. 1Odorizzi G. Cowles C.R. Emr S.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 282-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholarand 2Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Reizman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Most of these mechanisms require the recognition of specific sorting signals within the cytoplasmic domains of resident proteins by cytosolic factors. It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that there are redundant pathways to late endosomes and lysosomes in many eukaryotic cells. An example of this redundancy is observed inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, in which two apparently independent pathways with distinct effectors converge on the lysosome-like vacuole to deliver different sets of hydrolases and structural components (3Piper R.C. Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 531-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 4Cowles C.R. Snyder W.B. Burd C.G. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2768-2782Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Cargo selection for these two pathways relies on the recognition of distinct cytoplasmic sorting signals (5Vowels J.J. Payne G.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2482-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6Darsow T. Burd C.G. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 7Tan P.K. Howard J.P.

Evidence also exists in mammalian cells for multiple pathways from the trans-Golgi network to late endosomes (9Peters P.J. Neefjes J.J. Oorschot V. Ploegh H.L. Geuze H.J. Nature. 1991; 349: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 10Liu S.-H. Marks M.S. Brodsky F.M. J.

What advantage would be imparted to an organism by the evolution of independent pathways to late endosomes and lysosomes? For higher eukaryotes, one potential advantage would be the ability to subvert one pathway or the other in specific cell types to permit the development of unique, tissue-specific lysosome-like organelles. Such a strategy would be similar to that used to establish polarity in epithelial cells. Protein sorting to the basolateral and apical cell surfaces requires sorting signals that are recognized for packaging into distinct vesicular carriers in both polarized and non-polarized cells (14Yoshimori T. Keller P. Roth M.G. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 15Wilson J.M. Colton T.L. J.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether comparable mechanisms act in protein sorting to other tissue-specific post-Golgi organelles is not known. One tissue-specific organelle with the potential for accumulating a subpopulation of proteins diverted from the late endosome is the melanosome, the organelle of melanocytes in which melanin is synthesized (18Seiji M. Fitzpatrick T.B. Birbeck M.S.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1961; 36: 243-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19King R.A. Hearing V.J. Creel D.J. Oetting W.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 3. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 4353-4392Google Scholar). Melanosomes resemble secretory lysosomes in that they are highly acidic and often co-fractionate with markers of late endosomes and lysosomes such as lamp1, lamp2, CD63, and acid phosphatase (20Diment S. Eidelman M. Rodriguez G.M. Orlow S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4213-4215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 21Orlow S.J. J. Invest.

Histol. Histopathol. 1996; 11: 445-462PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, genes that control coat color in mice and skin color in humans encode proteins that are involved in lysosomal biogenesis (24Jackson I.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1613-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 25Kantheti P. Qiao X. Diaz M.E. Peden A.A. Meyer G.E. Carskadon S.L. Kapfhamer D. Sufalko D. Robinson M.S. Noebels J.L. Burmeister M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 111-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, melanosomes contain a unique cohort of resident membrane proteins and can be distinguished from late endosomes and lysosomes in some pigmented cells (26Orlow S.J. Boissy R.E. Moran D.J. Pifko-Hirst S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 55-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, resident proteins of both organelles must be differentially sorted, but the characteristics that distinguish between sorting to late endosomes/lysosomes and to melanosomes have not been established. Perhaps the best characterized melanosomal resident protein in normal and malignant melanocytes is tyrosinase (reviewed in Ref. 28del Marmol V. Beermann F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Human tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin biosynthesis, is a melanocyte-specific, type I integral membrane glycoprotein with a large lumenal domain, a 26-amino acid transmembrane domain, and a 30-amino acid cytoplasmic domain (Ref. 27Kwon B.S. Haq A.K. Pomerantz S.H. Halaban R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7473-7477Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1 for schematic). Impairment of tyrosinase activity in humans results in oculocutaneous albinism (OCA 1The abbreviations used are: OCA, oculocutaneous albinism; Ø, amino acid with bulky hydrophobic side chain; LL, di-leucine; YXXØ, tyrosine-based motif; AP, adaptor-like complex; TRP, tyrosinase-related protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; IFM, immunofluorescence microscopy; CHX, cycloheximide; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; LRSC, lissamine rhodamine-sulfonyl chloride; PE, phycoerythrin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Ref. 29King R.A. Mentink M.M. Oetting W.S. Mol. Biol. & Med. 1991; 8: 19-29PubMed Google Scholar). Among the many tyrosinase gene mutations that cause OCA or other pigmentation defects, two affect the cytoplasmic domain. The tyrosinase gene in mice homozygous for the c P (platinum) allele contains a single base substitution that eliminates all but the basic transmembrane anchor residues of the cytoplasmic tail; the product of this allele is therefore mistargeted and expressed at the cell surface (30Beermann F. Orlow S.J. Boissy R.E. Schmidt A. Boissy Y.L. Lamoreux M.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 61: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A similar mutation in human tyrosinase results in OCA (31Giebel L.B. Tripathi R.K. Strunk K.M. Hanifin J.M. Jackson C.E. King R.A. Spritz R.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 1159-1167PubMed Google Scholar), but the localization of the gene product in melanocytes from these patients has not been characterized. These reports suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of tyrosinase is critical for melanosomal protein sorting. Nevertheless, neither the precise nature of the sorting signals nor their behavior in non-pigmented cells is understood. Here, we explore the possibility that sorting signals with unique characteristics direct tyrosinase into a sorting pathway that is distinct from that used by typical residents of late endosomes and lysosomes. The cytoplasmic domain of human tyrosinase contains several potential conventional sorting signals. Among these are sequences that conform to classic di-leucine-based (LL) motifs (E510KQPLL515) and tyrosine-based motifs of the YXXØ consensus sequence (in which a tyrosine, Y, is separated by two residues, X, from an amino acid containing a bulky hydrophobic side chain, Ø; Y521HSL524), both common among proteins localized to endosomal compartments (32Trowbridge I.S.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain also contains a second tyrosine-containing sequence (Y525QSHL529) (see Fig.1 a). All three are conserved in mouse tyrosinase, and the LL motif and Tyr525 are conserved throughout vertebrate evolution. A role for the LL motif in melanosomal sorting is supported by a requirement of LL residues in tyrosinase related protein-1 (TRP-1) for intracellular localization (37Vijayasaradhi S. Xu Y.Q. Bouchard B. Houghton A.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and by recent evidence that the LL motif from mouse tyrosinase can bind to the AP3 sorting complex in vitro (38Höning S. Sandoval I.V. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We postulated that some or all of these motifs may direct endosomal sorting in a non-pigmented cell type. Here, using a panel of chimeric proteins and tyrosinase constructs in which these putative sorting signals have been altered by mutagenesis, we characterize the trafficking of tyrosinase in non-pigmented cells. Our results show that the LL motif is a dominant signal that directs late endosomal sorting through a distinct pathway from that directed by another well characterized late endosomal LL-based signal. This suggests that non-pigmented cells contain a second independent sorting pathway to the late endosome. Such a pathway provides a potential mechanism by which melanocytic cells can differentially sort proteins to the melanosome. Wild-type and mutant forms of human tyrosinase were recognized by αPEP7h (39Jiménez M. Tsukamoto K. Hearing V.J. J. Biol.

FITC, lissamine rhodamine (LRSC), and phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, Pennsylvania). HeLa, CV-1, 293, and M1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologics, Norcross, GA) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Transient transfections of cells grown on coverslips in 6 well dishes were performed essentially as described (46Marks M.S. Roche P.A. van Donselaar E. Woodruff L. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) using calcium phosphate precipitation. Except for overexpression studies, 50–100 ng of “expressor” plasmid DNA was used, and the balance was made up with “carrier” plasmid (empty pCDM8.1 vector) to 5 μg total; pilot studies showed that this protocol allowed detectable expression of previously characterized lysosomally targeted proteins without significant overexpression, as assessed by surface expression. Cells were generally assayed 2–3 days following transfection. For overexpression and competition experiments, cells were plated in 60- or 100-mm dishes and transfected with 8 or 20 μg of DNA, respectively. The R402Q allele of human tyrosinase was supplied in the mammalian expression vector pCI (Promega, Madison, WI) by W. Storkus (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh). Wild-type human tyrosinase 501 (gift of S. Topalian, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda), originally inserted into pCDNA3, was subcloned into pCDM8.1 using EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites. Original site-directed mutants were constructed using the tyrosinase R402Q construct, but due to apparent misfolding in cells grown at 37 °C, 2J. F. Berson, D. W. Frank, P. A. Calvo, B. M. Bieler, and M. S. Marks, manuscript in preparation. the R402Q substitution was corrected and the corrected form was used in all experiments shown. Correction was performed by PCR-mediated amplification of the site-directed mutants of tyrosinase R402Q sequences downstream of the allelic variation (coding region for the remaining lumenal domain fragment and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains) and substitution of the amplicon into wild-type tyrosinase 501 cDNA using BglII and XbaI restriction enzyme sites. The nucleic acid sequence of all constructs was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The plasmids pCDM8.1 (47Bonifacino J.S. Suzuki C.K. Klausner R.D.

Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), all cloned into pCDM8.1, have been previously described. Most site-directed mutants of the cytoplasmic tail of tyrosinase (see Fig. 1 a) were constructed using the GeneEditor in vitro Mutagenesis System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the directions of the supplier (details available upon request). Constructs in which Tyr525(XX/X/A) was mutated were made by PCR-mediated amplification of the wild-type or previously mutated sorting signals followed by sub-cloning of the amplicon using a unique BglII recognition site in the tyrosinase coding region and an XbaI site in the vector. Δtail-1 and Δtail-2 were made by insertion of a single PCR amplicon from the original construct. Plasmid DNA was screened for a unique restriction enzyme digestion pattern relative to the wild type, and sequences of mutants were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. All Tac chimeric constructs were prepared as described (46Marks M.S. Roche P.A. van Donselaar E. Woodruff L. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) in the mammalian expression vector pCDM8.1. Tac chimeras were generated for all constructs listed in Fig.1 using a two-step PCR method (52Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). Briefly, a chimeric insert was made encoding the lumenal and transmembrane domains of Tac fused to the cytoplasmic domain of tyrosinase flanked by unique BglII andXbaI restriction sites. The chimeric insert was then ligated into a previously modified Tac chimeric construct. DNA sequences of all chimeric constructs were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Forty-eight hours following transfection, cells were fixed using 2% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and washed with PBS. In some cases, cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX; 50 μg/ml) for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and washed in PBS prior to fixation. Cells that had been transfected with DNA encoding Tac chimeric proteins were either untreated or treated with 1 mg/ml leupeptin for 4 h prior to fixation. Cells were stained as described (53Humphrey J.S. Peters P.J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Stained coverslips were mounted on microscope slides using Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) and visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. Photographic images were digitized from negatives using a Nikon LS-1000 slide scanner and Adobe Photoshop 3.0 software. For overexpression studies and measurement of late endosomal diameter, analyses were done using a Leica microscope fitted with a MicroMax digital camera (Princeton Instruments Inc., Trenton, NJ) and OpenLab software (Improvision, Coventry, UK). Statistical analyses of endosomal diameter measurements was performed using the Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test on SigmaStat software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). HeLa cells transiently transfected with Tac chimeras or tyrosinase and/or Ip33 were metabolically labeled using 1–2 mCi/ml EXPRES35S (NEN Life Science Products) for 30 min as described (50Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Cell lysates prepared with 1% Triton X-100 were subjected to immunoprecipitation using protein A-Sepharose bound to 7G7.B6 (anti-Tac), PIN.1 (anti-Ip33), or αPEP7h (anti-tyrosinase) as described (50Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), except that lysates were first normalized for radioactive label content by trichloroacetic acid precipitation from lysate aliquots. Immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels, and radioactive bands were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Sunneyvale, CA). Average expression per cell was calculated by dividing the total radioactivity in precipitable bands by the transfection efficiency (fraction of positively stained cells by immunofluorescence microscopy). HeLa cells transiently transfected with Tac chimeras on coverslips were incubated with purified 7G7.B6 anti-Tac antibody (50 μg/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum for 30 min at 37 °C. All coverslips were washed 3 times in PBS and fixed for 20 min in 2% formaldehyde in PBS. Internalized mAb 7G7.B6 was detected using LRSC-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig, and total cellular Tac chimeras were visualized by staining with rabbit anti-Tac and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig as described above. This was performed essentially as described (50Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Tac chimeric proteins were purposefully overexpressed in HeLa cells by transient transfection using 20 μg of plasmid DNA in a 10-cm culture dish. In some experiments, cells were co-transfected with lower levels (0.5 μg) of plasmid DNA encoding Ip33 as a reporter protein. Sixty hours post-transfection, cells were harvested and divided into aliquots for analyses. In some experiments, levels of expression from each of the transfected DNAs was determined by pulse metabolic labeling of 1 aliquot followed by immunoprecipitation. For flow cytometric analysis, 0.5–1 × 106 viable cells were stained with the indicated primary antibodies for 1 h, washed, and then stained with FITC- and PE-conjugated secondary antibodies for an additional hour. Cells were then washed, fixed in 2% formaldehyde in PBS, and analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACScan (Franklin Lakes, NJ) and CellQuest 1.2 software. Dead cells were excluded from analysis by forward and side scatter measurements. In the analyses shown, cells were gated for those expressing high levels of the “overexpressor” Tac molecule at the cell surface. Transfection efficiencies were monitored by parallel immunofluorescence microscopy analyses. In order to assess the potential function of conventional sorting signals in the cytoplasmic domain, it was first necessary to determine the ultimate destination of tyrosinase in non-pigmented cells. To this end, tyrosinase was expressed in HeLa cells by transient transfection, and its localization was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM). When expressed at moderate levels, tyrosinase was detected in the nuclear envelope and in reticular and vesicular structures both throughout the cell cytoplasm and in the perinuclear area in most transfected cells (Fig. 2 a). Reticular and nuclear envelope staining was variable and more intense at higher levels of expression (data not shown). This staining pattern would be consistent with localization to both the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and endosomal compartments at steady state. Prominent ER staining is likely a result of slow egress of tyrosinase from the ER due to inefficient folding, supported by pulse/chase analyses in which the half-time for acquisition of resistance to digestion with endoglycosidase H is longer than 1 h.2 To visualize more clearly post-ER compartments, we therefore reduced the pool of newly synthesized, ER-retained tyrosinase by treating transfected cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX). As shown in Fig. 2 b, the staining pattern of cells treated for 1 h with CHX was predominantly vesicular. The appearance of tyrosinase in vesicular structures did not require the addition of lysosomal protease inhibitors, suggesting that it is relatively stable to proteolysis within these compartments. To determine the identity of the structures, CHX-treated transfected cells were double-stained with antibodies to tyrosinase and to endogenous endosomal proteins. As shown in Fig. 3, a and b, tyrosinase colocalized with lamp1, a constituent of late endosomes and lysosomes. The staining pattern with both markers was nearly identical in most cells at various expression levels. Near perfect colocalization was also observed with another marker of late endosomes and lysosomes, lamp2, but not with transferrin receptor (early and recycling endosomes), and peripheral tyrosinase+ vesicular structures did not contain the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (trans-Golgi network/late endosomes; data not shown). The staining pattern for lamp1 in cells that expressed the transgene did not consistently differ from that in cells that were not transfected, indicating that tyrosinase expression at moderate levels does not alter the morphology of lamp1-positive compartments. We conclude that tyrosinase is directed to conventional late endosomes and lysosomes in HeLa cells. Similar observations were made in CV-1, M1, and 293 cell lines (data not shown). To characterize the cytoplasmic sequences responsible for targeting tyrosinase to endosomal compartments, we used site-directed mutagenesis to disrupt critical residues of the putative LL and YXXØ sorting motifs and the additional conserved tyrosine residue Tyr525. Critical residues were altered individually or in combination to alanine (Fig. 1 a). Each mutagenized construct was expressed in HeLa cells by transient transfection, and localization was assessed in cells treated with CHX for 1 h by IFM and double staining with antibodies to the tyrosinase transgene and to endogenous lamp1. Tyrosinase with either or both of the cytoplasmic tyrosine residues disrupted (LL/A/Y, LL/Y/A, and LL/A/A) demonstrated IFM staining patterns similar to that of intact tyrosinase (Fig. 3, e, g,and i). Reticular staining was variable, likely due to differential retention in the ER, and relative staining intensities of given vesicles for lamp1 and tyrosinase were often variable, but the patterns of lamp1- and tyrosinase-containing vesicles were identical for all three mutant forms (arrowheads, Fig. 3,f, h, and j). In contrast, disruption of the putat"

Aptamers, extracted after 15 rounds of selection-amplification, either from a classical library of sequences or from virtual combinatorial libraries, displayed an imperfect stem-loop structure and presented a consensus motif 5′ACTCCCAT in the apical loop. The six central bases of the consensus were complementary to the TAR apical region, giving rise to the formation of RNA-DNA kissing complexes, without disrupting the secondary structure of TAR. The RNA-DNA kissing complex was a poor substrate for Escherichia coli RNase H, likely due to steric and conformational constraints of the DNA/RNA heteroduplex. 2′-O-Methyl derivatives of a selected aptamer were binders of lower efficiency than the parent aptamer in contrast to regular sense/antisense hybrids, indicating that the RNA/DNA loop-loop region adopted a non-canonical heteroduplex structure. These results, which allowed the identification of a new type of complex, DNA-RNA kissing complex, demonstrate the interest of in vitro selection for identifying non-antisense oligonucleotide ligands of RNA structures that are of potential value for artificially modulating gene expression.

These results, which allowed the identification of a new type of complex, DNA-RNA kissing complex, demonstrate the interest of in vitro selection for identifying non-antisense oligonucleotide ligands of RNA structures that are of potential value for artificially modulating gene expression. In the antisense strategy, a DNA oligonucleotide is designed to hybridize to an RNA sequence, in order to inhibit specifically the reading of the encoded genetic information (1Hélène C. Toulmé J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 99-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Although RNA is a single chain nucleic acid, it adopts secondary and tertiary structures, which can prevent the hybridization of the antisense sequence. This is one of the likely explanations of the poor inhibition efficiency, if any, induced by some antisense oligonucleotides. The aptamer strategy has been successfully used for the selection of ligands against a large range of targets, such as proteins and small molecules (nucleotides, amino acids, dyes) (see Ref. 2Gold L. Polisky B. Uhlenbeck O. Yarus M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 763-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar for a review). This methodology offers an alternative way for designing nucleic acid ligands against an RNA structure. Indeed, we previously demonstrated that in vitroselection of DNA ligands (aptamers) against DNA secondary structures led to the identification of sequences able to recognize the DNA targets through base pair formation and additional unidentified interactions (3Mishra R.K.

This might be of high potential interest, as numerous RNA structures display a regulatory function through interaction either with proteins (such as the iron-responsive element interacting with the iron-responsive element-binding protein (5Stripecke R.

Marquet R. Skriptin E. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 639-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)). The binding of an oligonucleotide to such structures could prevent the interaction of the RNA with the regulatory partner, hence controlling the expression of the target gene.We used the aptamer strategy to identify DNA ligands of the TAR RNA element; this RNA structure is a 59-nucleotide-long stem loop present at the 5′ end of HIV-1 RNA. TAR RNA mediates thetrans-activation of transcription through the binding (i) of the viral protein Tat to a three nucleotide bulge in the upper part of the stem (6Gait M.J. Karn J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 255-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and (ii) of cellular proteins to the upper region of the hairpin (8Gatignol A. Duarte M. Daviet L. Chang Y.N. Jeang K.T. Gene Expr. 1996; 5: 217-228PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting RNA-protein complex increases the processivity of the RNA polymerase, allowing the high yield synthesis of the full-length retroviral genome (9Graeble M.A. Churcher M.J. Lowe A.D. Gait M.J. Karn J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6184-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that oligonucleotides able to bind to TAR with a high affinity might compete with the TAR-binding proteins, thus preventing the transcription process.A DNA library comprising more than 1012 different sequences was screened on the basis of oligonucleotide ability to bind to TAR. We identified DNA sequences (aptamers) displaying a binding constant of about 108m−1. In contrast to antisense oligonucleotides, the selected aptamers did not invade the TAR stem-loop structure but rather fitted to the existing RNA structure. The selected aptamers could fold into imperfect stem-loop structures, displaying a consensus sequence in the aptamer loop, complementary to TAR loop. Therefore, TAR-aptamer interactions give rise to so-called “kissing complexes,” previously demonstrated to be involved in different natural RNA-RNA complexes (see Ref. 10Wagner E.G.H. Simons R.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 713-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar for a review). The binding properties of the DNA aptamers were analyzed as follows: we demonstrated that bases outside the loop play a key role in the binding to TAR, even though they do not directly interact with the RNA target. The upper part of the aptamer stem likely pre-organizes the loop to minimize the distortion required for loop-loop complex formation.MATERIALS AND METHODSLibraries of CandidatesOligonucleotidesFour DNA libraries were investigated each one having a random sequence of 30 nucleotides (nt), flanked by 18-nt-long conserved sequences used for PCR amplification. Families I, II, and III were obtained by in situ chemical (FI) or enzymatic (FII, FIII) ligation of so-called “half-candidates” from two different sub-libraries, 5′GCAGTCTCGTCGACACCC(N)15 and 5′P-(N)15GTGCTGGATCCGACGCAG (N represents any of the four natural nucleic acid bases). Family IV was 5′GCAGTCTCGTCGACACCC(N)30GTGCTGGATCCGACGCAG. Oligonucleotide primers were P1, 5′GCAGTCTCGTCGACACCC, and P2, 5′CTGCGTCGGATCCAGCAC.Chemical Ligation (FI)The mixture of half-candidates (100 pmol of each) was heated for 1 min at 80 °C and then cooled down in 5 min from 80 to 40 °C. 2 pmol of TAR in a final volume of 10 μl of 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 were then added to the candidates. A further linear decrease of temperature from 40 to 20 °C for 2 h, followed by a decrease from 20 to 4 °C at −1.5 °C/h, allowed the candidates to equilibrate in the presence of TAR. 10 μl of 400 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 200 mm NiCl2, 100 mm BrCN were then added at 4 °C, and the ligation reaction was allowed to proceed for 24 h at 4 °C.Enzymatic Ligations (FII and FIII)The same TAR/candidate mixing and annealing conditions as above were used, except the buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm ATP). At the end of the annealing step, the ligation was performed with 4 units of T4 RNA ligase, either for 10 h as the temperature decreased from 20 to 4 °C, and was then maintained at 4 °C for 14 h (Family II), or for 24 h at 4 °C (Family III). All reactions were stopped by freezing at −20 °C.2′-O-Methyl oligonucleotides were synthesized on a solid phase from base-protected 1-(2-O-methyl-3-O-(2-cyanoethoxy(diisopropylamino)-phosphino)-5-(4,4′-dimethoxytrityl)-β-d-nucleoside by using 1H-tetrazole as activator. TAR RNA was synthesized either enzymatically or chemically. 3′-Biotinylation was performed following the procedure described in Ref. 11von Ahsen U. Noller H.F. Science. 1995; 267: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar.In Vitro Selection15 rounds of selection/amplification were performed with each family.Selection10–75 pmol of single-stranded PCR-amplified candidates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in the presence of 1 pmol of 3′ end-biotinylated TAR, in D buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithioerythritol), in a final volume of 20 μl. TAR candidates were captured by magnetic streptavidin-coated beads (Promega), and the bound candidates were then eluted with water.AmplificationDouble-stranded amplification was performed in 50 μl with 25% of the TAR-bound candidates as template and 50 pmol of each primer, using Taq polymerase (0.5 units from Promega). Single-stranded candidates were then produced from the previous reaction by 30 PCR cycles, using 100 pmol of P1. The single-stranded candidates were phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and used for the next selection round without any further treatment.CloningAfter the 15th round of selection, the candidates were further amplified with primers P1clon(5′AATTCCTGCAGTCTCGTCGACACCC) and P2clon(5′GCCGCTCTAGACTGCGTCGGATCCAGCAC) and cloned in pBluescript. Inserts were sequenced by the Sanger method, either with T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or by automatic sequencing with dye terminators (Perkin-Elmer).Identification of Positive Clones, Electrophoretic Mobility Shift AssayTransfected bacteria were lysed by 5 min heating at 96 °C and then mixed with 50 pmol of each primer P1 and 5′-phosphorylated primer P2. After PCR amplification, single-stranded candidates were obtained by incubation for 2 h at 37 °C with 3 units of λ exonuclease (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 67 mm glycine, NaOH buffer, pH 9.4, containing 2.5 mm MgCl2, in order to selectively remove the phosphorylated strand. Candidates were phenol-extracted, precipitated, and evaluated for TAR binding by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA); 50 nm32P-5′-end-labeled TAR were incubated with candidates in D buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. The mixture was then loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, and 10 mm magnesium acetate, run at 4 °C for 18 h at 10 V/cm. For the subsequent analysis of chemically synthesized aptamers, the same procedure was used, except that the oligonucleotide of interest (5 nm) was labeled.FootprintsIn all experiments, 50 nm 5′-end-radiolabeled oligonucleotide (either TAR or the candidate) was preincubated for 20 min at 4 °C with 200 nm of the partner, in 8 μl (final volume) of the selection buffer. Radiolabeled TAR was then partially digested with either 2 ng of RNase A (Boehringer Mannheim) or 0.5 units of RNase T1 (Boehringer Mannheim) for 20 min at 4 °C. The 5′-end-radiolabeled DNA aptamer was digested by 200 units of S1 nuclease (Boehringer Mannheim) for 20 min at 4 °C. Diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC, 10%) reaction and potassium permanganate (KMnO4, 2 mm) modification were performed at 4 °C for 90 and 4 min, respectively. The DNA aptamer was then ethanol-precipitated and cleaved by 1 m piperidine, for 30 min at 90 °C. After DEPC modification, radiolabeled TAR was ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in 10 μl of Tris-HCl, 1m, pH 8. Following incubation for 30 min on ice in the dark with 10 μl of NaBH4 200 mm, it was ethanol-precipitated and cleaved with 1 m aniline acetate, pH 4.5, for 30 min at 60 °C in the dark.RNase H Assay50 nm32P-5′-end-labeled TAR were incubated for 3 h at 20 °C in 10 μl of D buffer in the presence of the desired aptamer (the concentration was adjusted to 50 times over the K d value at 4 °C) and of 1 unit ofEscherichia coli RNase H (Fermentas). The digested fragments were analyzed on a 20% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel.DISCUSSIONWe have selected aptamers against the HIV-1 TAR RNA element from DNA libraries containing candidates randomized at 30 positions. In order to take full advantage of the molecular diversity of such a population (>1018 different sequences) that surpasses by about 105 times the number of individuals that can be screened at a time in our in vitro selection experiment, we used a template-assisted combinatorial strategy for the first round of selection (15Huc I. Lehn J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2106-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). This approach relied on the spontaneous self-assembly on the surface of the target molecule, of short oligomers belonging to two different sub-libraries. The amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) used to produce the second generation of candidates that will be screened at the next selection step requires a physical link between an oligomer from sub-library 1 and another one from sub-library 2. This link was provided by a ligation step prior to the PCR. Therefore, as any sub-library 1 sequence can potentially be combined to any sub-library 2 sequence, we can in principle explore the full diversity of this virtual library, i.e. 415 × 415 = 1018 entities. The general interest of such libraries over standard selection methods is discussed in detail in Ref. 15Huc I. Lehn J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2106-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar. The ligation was ensured either chemically (FI) or enzymatically under two different conditions (FII and FIII), and the results of a 15-round selection with these three families were compared with that obtained with a conventional library with 30 random positions (FIV). The analysis of 76 clones belonging to the four families led to the identification of 20 sequences defining a single class of aptamers (class A) exhibiting affinity for TAR (the high background level is partly ascribed to the fact that the selection procedure was not stringent enough and that no counter selection step was introduced). The ligation step did not provide a clear benefit to the selection process. Indeed, winners (class A++ aptamers) were obtained from Families III and IV. At least four reasons might account for this outcome as follows. First, the template-assisted ligation of the candidates occurred only once at the first step of the process. Therefore, any further round will weaken the early potential enrichment of the library. Second, for our selected sequences, a limited number of residues actually contact the target: at most six bases engage direct interactions (hydrogen bonds) with the TAR RNA. Third, ligation occurred in the octameric consensus sequence, located in the loop-loop duplex, which can impede the enzyme or chemical reagent action. Finally, only combinations for which the 5′-phosphate group of one candidate is in contact with the 3′-OH end of another candidate can be ligated, thus restricting the selected sequences to a sub-class.In all families, the selected sequences showing binding ability for TAR displayed two important common features as follows: (i) a stem-loop structure and (ii) an octameric sequence in the loop, partly complementary to the TAR loop. We demonstrated that the TAR-aptamer complex involves loop-loop interactions, showing that kissing complexes constitute a valid recognition mode for RNA stem-loops by DNA sequences. Such interactions between two RNA stem-loops were previously extensively studied. It was demonstrated that kissing RNA complexes play a key role in the regulation of plasmid replication (16Tomizawa J.I. Cell. 1986; 47: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and in the dimerization of the retroviral genome (7Paillart J.C. Marquet R. Skriptin E. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 639-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). But this is to our knowledge the first time that such a complex is described between DNA and RNA hairpins.The structure of the double-stranded region resulting from loop-loop interactions is unknown. Recent NMR studies have shown that kissing RNA hairpins form a quasi-continuous structure of three coaxially stacked helices (17Chang K.Y. Tinoco I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8705-8709Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 18Marino J.P. Gregorian R.S.J. Csankovski G. Crothers D.M. Science. 1995; 268: 1448-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); the loop-loop helix is distorted compared with the A-form RNA and is bent toward the major groove. This reduces the distance between the two strands allowing a single phosphodiester bond to bridge the loops across the major groove. One such complex was formed between the HIV-1 TAR and TAR*, an RNA hairpin with a fully complementary loop (17Chang K.Y. Tinoco I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8705-8709Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our TAR-DNA aptamer kissing complexes can potentially involve six base pairs. This would require the disruption of the TAR C29–G36 base pair. Alternatively, only 5 base pairs can be formed, leaving an intact TAR stem (Fig. 3). TAR-DNA aptamer complexes will likely adopt a structure different from that of TAR-TAR*, as in the former case, loop-loop interactions will generate an RNA/DNA duplex flanked by double-stranded DNA (the aptamer stem) on one side and double-stranded RNA (the TAR stem) on the other side. RNA and DNA helices are A- and B-forms, respectively, whereas RNA/DNA hybrids adopt a different conformation for the two strands (19Fedoroff O.Y. Salazar M. Reid B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This leads to substantially different groove widths and thus to different interstrand distances. Whereas the gap across the major groove is about 10 Å for a 6-base loop in the A-form geometry, it is about twice as large in the B-form geometry (20Haasnoot C.A.G. Hilbers C.W. Van der Marel G.A. Van Boom J.H. Singh U.C. Pattabiraman N. Kollman P.A. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1986; 3: 843-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Stronger distortions and/or longer “connectors” will be required for the RNA/DNA than for the RNA-RNA kissing complex. Indeed, one or two bases (A32 of IV-04, C30 of TAR, and either C33 of IV-04 or C29 of TAR, see Fig. 3) are necessary to connect the stacked helices, in contrast to what has been previously described for the TAR-TAR* and the ColE1 complexes (17Chang K.Y. Tinoco I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8705-8709Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,18Marino J.P. Gregorian R.S.J. Csankovski G. Crothers D.M. Science. 1995; 268: 1448-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).The top of the stem of the aptamers seems to play a crucial role in the binding process. It is striking that the base pairs next to the loop are weak, A-T or G-T pairs (Fig. 2). Moreover, bulged bases or internal loops are frequently observed in the upper part of the stem. This suggests that a weak double-stranded structure in the vicinity of the binding loop was selected. Indeed, the removal of the bulged T41 in the aptamer IV-04 or the insertion of an A in the opposite strand, both modifications restoring perfect helicity in this region and consequently stabilizing the stem, led to a 25–40-fold increase in K d. The nature of the nucleic acid base was not important, as a non-nucleotide linker partly restored the affinity, indicating a structural role for this bulged residue. These imperfect structures are reminiscent of the kissing complexes formed by natural antisense RNAs involved in bacterial plasmid replication. In most of the cases where a single stem-loop is involved, the antisense RNA does not fold in a perfect hairpin structure. As demonstrated by Hjalt and Wagner (21Hjalt T.A.H. Wagner E.G.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the deletion of the bulge and of the internal loop of the upper stem in CopA antisense RNA increased theK d of the kissing intermediate up to 14-fold, thus showing the structural role of these abnormalities in the helicity for kissing complexes. Therefore, secondary and tertiary structures in these regions are crucial for the proper presentation of the interacting loops in RNA-RNA as well as RNA-DNA loop-loop complexes.The E. coli ribonuclease H displayed a very low activity on the TAR RNA/IV-04 DNA hybrid (Fig. 7). Three explanations can be proposed as follows. (i) For the length of the heteroduplex, it was reported that heteroduplex as short as 4 base pairs are substrates for this enzyme (22Inoue H. Hayase Y. Imura A. Iwai S. Miura K. Ohtsuka E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6131-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Even though 6 bases of the IV-04 loop are complementary to the upper part of the TAR RNA element (including the last G residue next to the TAR loop), we do not know the actual number of paired bases. (ii) The formation of the kissing complex requires that the connecting residues between the 3′ ends of the loop-loop “helix” and either the TAR or the aptamer stems cross the grooves of the loop-loop region (18Marino J.P. Gregorian R.S.J. Csankovski G. Crothers D.M. Science. 1995; 268: 1448-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 23Chang K.Y. Tinoco I. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 52-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These linkers might interfere with the RNase H binding and/or activity. Indeed, pseudo-half-knot antisense DNA-RNA hairpin complexes were reported to be cleaved with a reduced efficiency compared with a linear double-stranded RNA duplex, indicating that loop regions crossing either the major or the minor groove of the loop-loop helix interfered with RNase H (24Lima W.F. Mohan V. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18191-18199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, in both cases (“duplex length” and “limited access”), the IV-04 derivatives share the same loop region, i.e. form the same duplex region and have the same connector length. Therefore, we strongly favor the third parameter as the key determinant of low RNase H activity on RNA-aptamer complexes: (iii) the bent structure of the kissing complex. RNase H requires a nucleic acid region upstream (with respect to the RNA strand) from the cleaved region for binding, likely through electrostatic interactions (Fig.8 a) (25Morikawa K. Katayanagi K. Crouch R.J. Toulmé J.J. Crystal Structures of RNase H from Procaryotes, Ribonucleases H. Les Editions INSERM, Paris1998: 181-193Google Scholar). This means that, in IV-04·TAR complexes, the enzyme should interact with the aptamer stem in order, for the catalytic site, to be appropriately positioned on the loop-loop heteroduplex (Fig. 8 b). Therefore any distortion at the heteroduplex-aptamer stem junction will displace the catalytic site away from the substrate region. It is known that RNA-RNA hairpin complexes adopt a bent conformation in order to allow loop-loop interactions (18Marino J.P. Gregorian R.S.J. Csankovski G. Crothers D.M. Science. 1995; 268: 1448-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 23Chang K.Y. Tinoco I. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 52-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A similar structure for aptamer-TAR complexes will preclude a good contact between the catalytic site and the loop-loop region once the enzyme is bound to the aptamer stem. The high efficiency of cleavage obtained with the short IV-0412derivative is in reasonable agreement with this hypothesis; in contrast to the bent rigid structure of TAR·IV-04 complex, the 3′ part of IV-0412 derivative will provide a flexible binding site for the enzyme compatible with catalytic site facing the TAR RNA hybridized loop (Fig. 8 c). When increasing the stem length, the complex is more stacked and constrained, hence more stable, but resulting in a worse substrate for RNase H. Different curvatures induced by different stems (for instance IV-0439(+A30) and IV-0439(−T41)) will generate various structures for the complexes that are sensed by RNase H, eventually leading to cuts outside the paired region (Fig. 8 d). Cleavages outside the RNA/DNA duplex were previously reported for regular (26Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27513-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Le Tinévez R. Mishra R.K. Toulmé J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2273-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and chemically modified duplexes (28Larrouy B. Boiziau C. Sproat B. Toulmé J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3434-3440Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Toulmé J.J. Le Tinévez R. Brossalina E. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).It is striking that a full-length (30-mer) antisense sequence corresponding to the random region of the library was not selected. This confirmed that antisense oligodeoxynucleotides are not good ligands for structured RNA regions. Indeed, it was demonstrated that anti-TAR DNA 17-mers, including a sequence complementary to the top part of the TAR element and which adopted a hairpin structure, had a poor affinity (30Ecker D.J. Vickers T.A. Bruice T.W. Freier S.M. Jenison R.D. Manoharan M. Zounes M. Science. 1992; 257: 958-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); this oligomer was therefore not able to give rise to kissing complex formation.We selected DNA molecules that might inhibit TAR-dependent activation of transcription. It is expected that IV-04 will not directly interfere with the binding of Tat, as the binding sites of these two molecules on TAR are different. In contrast, the cellular proteins TRP 185 (31Wu F. Garcia J. Sigman D. Gaynor R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2128-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), TRBP (32Gatignol A. Buckler-White A. Berkhout B. Jeang K.T. Science. 1991; 251: 1597-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and the Tat·cyclin T·CDK9 complex (33Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar) bind to TAR at the level of the loop. This could allow DNA aptamers to prevent the transcription activation controlled by these proteins. The competition between Tat or TRBP and the aptamers is presently under investigation. In the antisense strategy, a DNA oligonucleotide is designed to hybridize to an RNA sequence, in order to inhibit specifically the reading of the encoded genetic information (1Hélène C. Toulmé J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 99-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Although RNA is a single chain nucleic acid, it adopts secondary and tertiary structures, which can prevent the hybridization of the antisense sequence. This is one of the likely explanations of the poor inhibition efficiency, if any, induced by some antisense oligonucleotides. The aptamer strategy has been successfully used for the selection of ligands against a large range of targets, such as proteins and small molecules (nucleotides, amino acids, dyes) (see Ref. 2Gold L. Polisky B. Uhlenbeck O. Yarus M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 763-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar for a review). This methodology offers an alternative way for designing nucleic acid ligands against an RNA structure. Indeed, we previously demonstrated that in vitroselection of DNA ligands (aptamers) against DNA secondary structures led to the identification of sequences able to recognize the DNA targets through base pair formation and additional unidentified interactions (3Mishra R.K.

https://openalex.org/W2114458975,"The binding of bradykinin (BK) to B2 receptor triggers the internalization of the agonist-receptor complex. To investigate the mechanisms and the receptor structures involved in this fundamental process of receptor regulation, the human B2 receptor was mutated within its cytoplasmic tail by complementary strategies of truncation, deletion, and amino acid substitution. Ligand binding, signal transduction, internalization as well as phosphorylation were studied for the mutated receptors expressed in COS, CHO, and HEK 293 cells. Truncation of 44 out of 55 amino acid residues of the receptor's cytoplasmic tail corresponding to positions 321–364 did not alter the kinetics of BK binding and the receptor coupling to phospholipase C and phospholipase A2. By contrast, truncations after positions 320 and 334, deletions within the segment covering positions 335–351, as well as alanine substitution of serine and threonine residues within segment 335–351 diminished the internalization capacity of the mutant receptors. Mutants with a markedly reduced internalization potential failed to produce BK-induced receptor phosphorylation suggesting that phosphorylation may be involved in receptor internalization. The mutagenesis approaches converged at the conclusion that three serines in positions 339, 346, and 348 and two threonines in positions 342 and 345, contained in a sequence segment that is highly conserved between species, have a critical role in the ligand-dependent internalization and phosphorylation of kinin receptors and can intervene in these processes in an alternative manner. However, mutants lacking these residues were still sensitive to dominant-negative forms of β-arrestin and dynamin, suggesting the existence of additional receptor structure(s) involved in the receptor sequestration through clathrin-coated vesicles.

Desensitization can be a consequence of receptor endocytosis (1Von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and may also result from receptor phosphorylation that prevents further activation of G proteins (2Benya R.V. Fathi Z.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2439-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Negative cooperativity in bradykinin (BK) binding due to receptor-receptor interaction in the cell membrane can also contribute to the desensitization of some receptors including the BK B2 receptor (4Pizard A.

For few GPCRs, internalization appears to be a prerequisite for resensitization prior to receptor recycling to the plasma membrane (5Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Internalization is believed to involve clathrin-coated vesicles and/or caveolin-rich vesicles, and to result from an interaction of components of the endocytic machinery with specific motifs located in the cytoplasmic domains of the receptor (6Ferguson S.S.G. Downey W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). For many receptors, the carboxyl tail has been found to play a critical role in receptor internalization (2Benya R.V. Fathi Z. Battey J.F. Jensen R.T. J. Biol.

Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms that trigger internalization of the agonist-occupied receptor have been studied for only a few receptors. Phosphorylation has been implicated in the desensitization process uncoupling the receptor from G proteins, and in the initiation of internalization sequestering the receptor from the cell surface (2Benya R.V. Fathi Z. Battey J.F. Jensen R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20285-20290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Chabry J. Botto J.-M. Nouel D. Beaudet A. Vincent J.-P. Mazella J. J. Biol.

Indeed, mutations of potential phosphorylation sites of the GLP-1, muscarinic m3, and the cholecystokinin receptors have been shown to reduce their internalization (11Widmann C. Dolci W. Thorens B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1094-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Yang J. Williams J.A. Yule D.I. Logsdon C.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 477-485PubMed Google Scholar, 13Pohl M.

However, receptor internalization and desensitization are not always causally linked,e.g. mutations of certain GPCRs suppressed desensitization but not internalization (14Bouvier M. Hausdorff W.P.

Clearly, the two processes can proceed independently although they may involve the same type of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. Prototypical GPCRs that differ by their ligand-induced densensitization, phosphorylation, and internalization are the receptors for the vasoactive kinin peptides. Two subtypes of mammalian kinin receptors, B1 and B2, have been recognized so far (16Regoli D. Barabé J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1980; 32: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17Hess J.F.

The B2 receptor is responsible for most of the physiological actions of BK including vasodilation (19Bhoola K.D. Figueroa C.D. Worthy K. Pharmacol.

More recently, other signaling pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway were found to be triggered via the B2 receptor (22Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A.

The time course of BK-stimulated phosphorylation paralleled the kinetics of desensitization/resensitization and of internalization/recycling of the receptor, suggesting that these phenomena may be interrelated (21Blaukat A. Abd Alla S. Lohse M.J. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32366-32374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The present work was aimed at studying the role of the COOH-terminal tail of the human renal B2 bradykinin receptor (referred as wild-type, B2wt) in BK binding, coupling to signaling pathways, internalization, and phosphorylation. For this purpose, we generated a series of human B2 receptor mutants and transfected them into COS-7 cells, CHO-K1, and HEK 293 cells. Three complementary strategies were followed for mutagenesis, by generating mutants with truncated COOH-terminal tail, mutants with deletion of internal regions of the COOH-terminal tail, and mutants with serine and/or threonine residue(s) replaced by alanine. This allowed us to demonstrate that a cluster of three serine and two threonine residues located in the center portion of the COOH-terminal tail region that becomes phosphorylated in response to BK is involved in the internalization of the B2 receptor. Co-transfection of the B2wt and its mutants with β-arrestin and dynamin mutants documented a role of clathrin-coated pit pathway in receptor internalization. Mutant cDNAs were constructed by using the previously cloned B2wt cDNA placed under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter into the eucaryotic expression vector pcDNA3(Invitrogen, Leek, Netherlands) (4Pizard A. Marchetti J. Allegrini J. Alhenc-Gelas F. Rajerison R.M. J. Biol.

All mutations were sequenced using an AmplicycleTM sequencing kit (Perkin Elmer, Langen, Germany). Three truncated B2 mutants, tR351, tI334, and tY320 were created by single nucleotide substitutions (indicated by bold face in the sequences given below) at the appropriate sites so as to create stop codons (underlined) terminating translation at positions 351, 334, and 320, respectively, of the protein sequence (numbering according to Hess et al. (17Hess J.F. Borkowski J.A. Macneil T. Stonesifer G.Y. Fraher J. Strader C.D. Ransom R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 1-8Google Scholar)). The nucleotide sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used were: 5′-CGTGGAACGC TAGATTCACAAACTG-3′ for the mutant tR351, 5′-CAGAACCCATT TAGATGGAGAACTCC-3′ for tI334, and 5′-GGAGGTGTAC TAGGGAGTGTG-3′ for tY320. Hence deletion mutants tR351, tI334, and tY320 lacked the terminal 13, 30, and 44 amino acid residues, respectively, of the human B2 receptor. Deletions of regions within the COOH-terminal tail of the B2 receptor were obtained by mutagenesis with the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-CAGGTCAGAACCCATTCAGATTCACAAACTGC-3′ for the mutant del[335–351], 5′-CAGGTCAGAACCCATTCTGCGGACCTCCATC-3′ for del[335–342] and 5′-CTCCATGGGCACACAGATTCACAAACTGC-3′ for del[343–351]. The resulting mutants del[335–351], del[335–342], and del[343–351] lacked 17, 8, and 9 amino acid residues, respectively; their relative positions within the protein sequence are given in brackets. Point mutations were created by the same procedure to replace Ser and/or Thr residues in the COOH-terminal tail by Ala using the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-GGAGATCCAG GCCGAGAGGAGG-3′ for the mutant T237A, 5′-CGAAAGAAG GCTTGGGAGGTG-3′ for S316A, 5′-GGCTGCAGG GCAGAACCC-3′ for S331A, 5′-GATGGAGAAC GCCATGGGCAC-3′ for S339A, 5′-CTCCATGGGC GCACTGCGGAC-3′ for T342A, 5′-GCACACTGCGG GCCGCCATCTCCGTG-3′ for T345A/S346A, 5′-GACCTCCATC GCCGTGGAAC-3′ for S348A, 5′-GGAGAAC GCCATGGGC GCACTGCGG-3′ for S339A/T342A and 5′-GAAC GCCATGGGC GCACTGCGG GCCGCCATC GCCGTGG-3′ for B2ΔST in which Ser339, Thr342, Thr345, Ser346, and Ser348 were simultaneously substituted by Ala. The mutant S339A/T345A/S346A was obtained by combining the primers used for the S339A and T345A/S346A mutants. COS-7 and HEK 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biological Industries, Israel) and CHO-K1 cells in Ham's F-12 medium (Seromed, Berlin, Germany) both supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. For immunoprecipitation and phosphorylation studies, transient receptor expression was achieved by transfecting COS-7 cells grown in 6-well plates using the LipofectAMINETM method (Life Technologies). Otherwise, transfections were performed with cells grown in T75 flasks (COS-7 cells) by using the DEAE-dextran method (26Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) and the cells were then subcultured into 24-well plates where binding, internalization, PLC, and PLA2 activation experiments were performed or with cells directly grown in 24-well plates (HEK 293 and CHO-K1 cells) by using Superfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). CHO-K1 cell clones that were selected with geneticin (0.75 μg/ml) for stable expression and with [3H]BK binding and coupling assays for receptor expression, were expanded to obtain the CHO-K1 cell lines used in some experiments. All cell types were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified water-jacketed incubator with 5% CO2. Functional studies of the transfected cells were done at confluence. Control cells were created by transfecting the pcDNA3 vector without insert. Cells were incubated as described previously (4Pizard A. Marchetti J. Allegrini J. Alhenc-Gelas F. Rajerison R.M. J. Biol.

For equilibrium studies and determination of receptor density or apparent affinity for [3H]BK, incubation was carried out at 4 °C for 6 h in the presence of 1.25 × 10−11 to 2.5 × 10−8m [3H]BK (COS cells) or 10−11 to 10−7m[3H]BK (CHO cells). The cells were extensively washed with HBSS and bound [3H]BK was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. Internalization of [3H]BK was studied by incubating the cells with 2 nm[3H]BK at 37 °C for 2 to 70 min (4Pizard A. Marchetti J. Allegrini J. Alhenc-Gelas F. Rajerison R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1309-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with HBSS before cell surface-bound radioligand was separated from internalized radioactivity by an acidic washing step (27Haigler H.T. Maxfield F.R. Willingham M.C. Pastan I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1239-1241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 0.2m acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 2.5. To study the role of protein kinase C (PKC) activity, cells were preincubated with 10−7m phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or 10−7m staurosporine (Sigma, St-Quentin-Fallavier, France) for 30 min before and during the incubation with [3H]BK. To monitor the effect of phosphatase inhibitor, cells were incubated with 10−7m okadaic acid (Sigma) 5 min prior to [3H]BK challenge, and internalization was followed for 10 min in the continuous presence of the phosphatase inhibitor. In some internalization experiments, cells were treated with hypertonic saline solution containing 0.4 m sucrose to study the contribution of clathrin-coated vesicle pathway (28Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). In addition, internalization was examined in cells co-transfected with the receptor and with rat β-arrestin cDNA or its inactive fragment (319–418) mutant in pEGFP obtained from Bunnett and co-workers (29McConalogue K. Corvera C.U. Camp P.D. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2305-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and pcDNA3 plasmids encoding for bovine β-arrestin fragment (319–418) mutant and inactive human dynamin K44A both obtained from Benovic and co-workers (30Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6976-6981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Co-transfection was done using 15 μg of each plasmid. For determination of specific binding, each assay included measurements of nonspecific binding in the presence of 1000-fold excess of unlabeled BK; nonspecific binding was substracted from total binding determined in the absence of unlabeled BK. In each culture plate, the protein content was determined according to the manufacturer's instructions in three wells using BSA as the standard protein (Bio-Rad, München, Germany). Cells were loaded for 18 h at 37 °C with 3 μCi/mlmyo-[2-3H]inositol (10–20 Ci/mmol, Amersham International) added to the culture medium. The cells were washed twice with HBSS, preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 10 mmLiCl in HBSS containing 0.1% BSA and the protease inhibitors used for binding assay, and stimulated for 15 min with BK at varying concentrations (10−10 to 10−7m). To study the role of PKC, cells were treated with PMA (10−7m) or staurosporine (10−7m) for 30 min before and during the incubation with BK. Reactions were terminated by addition of 3% (w/v) ice-cold perchloric acid and total [3H]inositol phosphate radioactivity was isolated using AG1-X8 anion exchange column chromatography (formate form, 100–200 mesh, Bio-Rad) after the radioactivity contained in phospholipids had been extracted with chloroform (4Pizard A.

Results are expressed as the ratio between the radioactivity measured in the inositol phosphates and the total radioactivity incorporated into the overall compounds labeled withmyo-[3H]inositol. Cells were labeled to equilibrium with 1 μCi/ml [3H]arachidonic acid (150–230 Ci/mmol; Amersham International) for 18 h. After washing steps to eliminate unbound radiolabel (4Pizard A. Marchetti J. Allegrini J. Alhenc-Gelas F. Rajerison R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1309-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), phospholipase A2 activation experiments were performed at 37 °C for 10 min in HBSS containing 0.1% BSA, protease inhibitors, and the test compounds or vehicles. The medium radioactivity containing the released [3H]arachidonic acid plus derived 3H-labeled metabolites was counted and expressed in percent of the total radioactivity, i.e. the medium plus cell associated radioactivity. Cells were washed twice with sulfur-free HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the same medium, and labeled with 0.1 mCi/ml 35S-labeled amino acids (Prox-mixTM, Amersham International) for 8 h (21Blaukat A. Abd Alla S. Lohse M.J. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32366-32374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). After three washes with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl (Tris-buffered saline), cells were scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mm Pefabloc SCTM, and 10 μg/ml each of 1,10-phenantroline, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, and incubated for 45 min at 4 °C under gentle rocking. The resulting lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm and the supernatants were precleared with 50 μl ofStaphylococcus aureus cell suspension (PansorbinTM, Calbiochem). To immunoprecipitate the receptor, 2.5 μl of antiserum AS346 (21Blaukat A. Abd Alla S. Lohse M.J. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32366-32374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) diluted in 0.1 ml of 5% BSA in lysis buffer was added. After 15 min at room temperature, 50 μl of PansorbinTM was added, and the suspension incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The precipitate was recovered by a centrifugation for 2 min at 6,000 rpm and washed three times with lysis buffer and once with water. SDS sample buffer (25 μl) was added to the immunoprecipitate followed by a 15-min incubation at 45 °C. Proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in the presence of 5m urea. After fixation with 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid for 20 min, the gels were washed several times with water and subjected to fluorography using 15% (w/v) sodium salicylate as the fluorophor. For control, the antiserum was preadsorbed for 90 min at room temperature with the peptide antigen coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-free HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and labeled with 0.25 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (ICN) for 8 h in the same medium. After a 5-min exposure to 1 μm BK or vehicle at 37 °C, cells were scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (see above) and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm sodium fluoride, 25 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). To study the role of PKC and the effect of phosphatase inhibitor, cells were exposed to 0.1 μm PMA and 0.1 μm okadaic acid, respectively, in the absence or presence of 1 μm BK before the cell lysis. Solubilization, immunoprecipitation, and gel electrophoresis were carried out as above. Proteins labeled by [32P]orthophosphate were revealed by autoradiography. Our strategy to analyze the role of the COOH-terminal domain of the B2 receptor in ligand binding, signal transduction, sequestration, and phosphorylation involved the production of mutants with progressive truncations of the COOH-terminal tail of the receptor, deletions of defined portions of the tail region, or exchange of single or multiple residues of serine and threonine against alanine at defined positions of the COOH-terminal domain of the receptor. Initially we tested for the presence of endogenous B2 receptor in the COS cells using mock-transfected cells and comparing them with transfected cells expressing the wild-type human B2receptor (COSB2wt). The receptor density measured by [3H]BK binding and the BK-sensitive PLC activity determined by IPs production in mock-transfected COS cells represented <5% of the values measured in COSB2wt, whereas the ligand-induced [Ca2+]i transients of mock-transfected cells were similar to those obtained with COSB2wt (data not shown). No PLA2 activation was observed in mock-transfected or COSB2wt cells indicating the absence of this transduction pathway in COS-7 cells. Therefore we choose [3H]BK binding and IPs production to exemplify the signaling properties of the recombinant human B2 receptors expressed in COS-7 cells. No endogenous B2 receptor was detected with [3H]BK binding, PLC, or PLA2 assays in the mock-transfected CHO-K1 and HEK 293 cells. To study the functional role of the COOH-terminal tail region corresponding to intracellular domain ID-4 of the B2wt we produced three truncation variants with progressive deletions of the COOH-terminal portion of the receptor. These truncation mutants are designated by “t” followed by the name (single letter code) and position of their carboxyl-terminal amino acid, i.e. tR351, tI334, and tY320; they lack the COOH-terminal 14, 30, or 44 residues of the native receptor (Fig. 1). Three deletion mutants are designated by “del” followed by the positions delimiting the deleted region, i.e. del[335–351], del[335–342], and del[343–351] lacking 17, 8, and 9 residues, respectively, of the COOH-terminal tail region (Fig. 1). We also created 7 receptor mutants in which alanine (Ala) was substituted for serine (Ser) or threonine (Thr) residue(s), singly or combined (TableI). In the mutant B2ΔST we exchanged 5 Ser/Thr residues located in the center portion of the COOH-terminal domain, i.e. at positions 339, 342, 345, 346, and 348 (Fig. 1). We have also constructed 3 mutants where Ser/Thr residues have been replaced by Ala in other regions of the receptor,i.e. T237A, S316A, and S331A (not shown). The rationale for the design of the various mutants is given below.Table I[3H]BK binding and BK-induced PLC activation characteristics of B2wt and mutant receptors in COS cellsReceptors[3H]BK bindingPLC activationK D,appB maxBasal activityMaximal effectaRatio between maximal (10−7m BK) and basal IPs productions.EC50nmpmol [3H]BK bound/mg protein% of total radioactivitynmB2wt4.4 ± 0.55.5 ± 1.00.7 ± 0.14.2 ± 0.40.4 ± 0.1Truncation mutantstR3514.4 ± 0.19.5 ± 3.10.6 ± 0.15.3 ± 0.50.8 ± 0.2tI3342.5 ± 0.34.0 ± 0.51.0 ± 0.15.1 ± 0.70.2 ± 0.1tY3202.9 ± 1.00.8 ± 0.20.5 ± 0.14.1 ± 0.32.2 ± 0.9Deletion mutantsdel[335–351]2.4 ± 0.26.1 ± 1.50.7 ± 0.15.5 ± 1.10.2 ± 0.1del[335–342]2.3 ± 0.34.9 ± 1.10.7 ± 0.15.5 ± 0.60.3 ± 0.1del[343–351]2.7 ± 0.26.3 ± 1.50.8 ± 0.15.6 ± 0.50.2 ± 0.1Ser/Thr point mutantsS339A5.4 ± 0.97.6 ± 2.20.5 ± 0.18.5 ± 0.80.5 ± 0.3T342A5.6 ± 0.75.5 ± 0.30.5 ± 0.16.2 ± 0.70.2 ± 0.1S346A5.1 ± 0.35.8 ± 0.40.7 ± 0.15.1 ± 1.20.3 ± 0.1S339A/T342A3.7 ± 0.44.6 ± 0.40.7 ± 0.16.8 ± 2.10.2 ± 0.1T345A/S346A6.3 ± 1.59.1 ± 2.60.7 ± 0.16.9 ± 0.70.3 ± 0.1S339A/T345A/S346A4.3 ± 0.75.8 ± 1.50.8 ± 0.16.5 ± 2.10.4 ± 0.2B2ΔST2.8 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.20.7 ± 0.25.2 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.1In each binding experiment, up to eight mutants were studied together with the B2wt as control.

Studying the regulation of IL-5 gene expression by Ets transcription factors, we found that Ets1 and Ets2, but not Elf-1, were able to activate the human IL-5 promoter in Jurkat T-cells. This required the presence of either phorbol 12-myristate acetate (PMA) plus ionomycin or PMA plus the viral protein HTLV-I Tax1. By mutation studies, it could be shown that Ets1 and Ets2 exerted their effects on the IL-5 promoter through a GGAA motif within the Cle0 element. In myeloid Kasumi cells, Ets1 and Ets2 failed to stimulate IL-5 promoter activity, unless the T-cell specific transcription factor GATA3 was added. These results show, for the first time, that Ets1 and Ets2 are able to cooperate with GATA3. Both ionomycin and Tax1 increased the combined effect of GATA3 with Ets1 and Ets2 in the presence of PMA. The data further demonstrate that, in addition to Ets1, Ets2 is also able to functionally cooperate with Tax1. The synergism of GATA3 with either Ets1 or Ets2 may play an important role in calcium- or Tax1-dependent regulation of IL-5 expression in Th2 cells or in HTLV-I transformed adult T-cell leukemia cells, respectively.

Ets proteins are transcription factors that share a unique DNA-binding domain, the Ets domain, allowing these proteins to interact specifically with GGA(A/T)-based recognition sites (for a review, see Ref. 33Ghysdael J. Boureux A. Yaniv M. Ghysdael J. Oncogenes as Transcriptional Regulators. 1. Birkhaeuser Verlag, Basel1997: 29-88Google Scholar). Ets transcription factors have been found to play a crucial role in controlling transcription of a variety of genes involved in important cellular processes, such as proliferation or differentiation. They have also been shown to contribute to the development of certain human diseases (for review, see Ref. 34Dittmer J. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: F1-F11PubMed Google Scholar). Some Ets proteins, such as Ets1, Elf-1, and Fli-1, are primarily expressed in T-cells where they fulfill important functions, e.g. Ets1 has been reported to play a crucial role in T-cell survival (35Bories J.C.

Nature. 1995; 377: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The IL-5 promoter shares with other cytokine promoters, such as the granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor promoter, the so-called conserved lymphokine element (Cle0) (37Wang C.Y. Bassuk A.G. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Bravo R. Leiden J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1153-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It is a composite AP1/Ets element, which supports activation of the granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor promoter by Ets1 in an AP1/NF-κB dependent manner (37Wang C.Y. Bassuk A.G.

This raises the question of whether Ets proteins may also be able to regulate the IL-5 promoter. In order to address this possibility, we performed transient transfection studies with Jurkat T-cells and the myeloid Kasumi cell line. We found that Ets1 and Ets2, but not Elf-1, were able to activate the IL-5 promoter in Jurkat cells in the presence of either PMA plus ionomycin or PMA plus Tax1. Using Kasumi cells, we could show that Ets1 and Ets2 needed to cooperate with GATA3 for their stimulatory activities on the IL-5 promoter. These synergisms were enhanced in the presence of ionomycin or HTLV-I Tax1. The data suggest an important role for Ets proteins in the regulation of the IL-5 expression in Th2 lymphocytes and HTLV-I transformed leukemic cells. Jurkat T-cells and myeloid Kasumi cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in the absence of any antibiotic. Plasmids pKCR3-c-ets1, ΔEBets1 Δ243–330, pCTax, pCM5-Tax, and pCM7-Tax for expression of p54ets1, p46ets1, WT-Tax1, M5-Tax1, or M7-Tax1, respectively, are described elsewhere (40Pognonec P.

The plasmids ΔEBets2 and ΔEBelf-1 for expression of Ets2 or Elf-1, respectively, were generous gifts from Jacques Ghysdael. The plasmid RSV/hG3 for expression of human GATA3 was kindly provided by James D. Engel. For construction of the −494/+44 IL-5 promoter/luciferase plasmid (pIL5P.luc), the IL-5 promoter fragment was first amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers as described previously (13Gruart-Gouilleux V. Engels P. Sullivan M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1431-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), followed by cloning this fragment into a luciferase-containing vector (44Annweiler A. Muller-Immergluck M. Wirth T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3107-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For generation of the deletion mutant −106/+44 IL-5 promoter, the internal HindIII/BsmI fragment, containing the IL-5 promoter sequence from −494 to −82, was replaced by an oligonucleotide bearing the IL-5 specific sequence from −106 to −82. For creating the G to A mutation at position −44 of the antisense strand, we polymerase chain reaction amplified an approximately 500-base pair long fragment containing the IL-5 promoter fragment from −81 to +44 and part of the luciferase gene by using the following primers: 5′-GGCATTCTCTATCTGATTGTTAGAAATTATTCATTTCTTCAAAGACAG-3′ (the mutated nucleotide is underlined) and 5′-AATTGAAGAGAGTTTTCACTGCATACGACGATTCTGTGATTTGTATTC-3′. The fragment was cloned into the polymerase chain reaction 2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and, after cutting with BsmI andXbaI, inserted into the −106/+44 IL-5 luciferase construct creating the −106/+44 EM IL-5 promoter luciferase plasmid. Jurkat and Kasumi cells were transfected with 5 μg of an IL-5 luciferase construct by electroporation using a Bio-Rad gene pulser under conditions, as described previously (45Dittmer J. Gitlin S.D. Reid R.L. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6087-6095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For expression of Ets1, Ets2, or Elf-1, 6 μg of the corresponding expression plasmid was added to the transfection mixture, while for expression of Tax1 or GATA3, 4 μg of pCTax or 2 μg of RSV/hG3, respectively, was used. One hour after transfection either PMA (final concentration: 10 ng/ml) and/or ionomycin (final concentration: 2 μm), both dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, or dimethyl sulfoxide (control) was added to the cells. After another 6 h cells were harvested. Cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity according to Ref. 46Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Houthaeve T. Nordheim A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar. Nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells were prepared essentially as described (28Pise-Masison C.A. Dittmer J. Clemens K.E. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1236-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. After resuspension in 1 ml of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubation on ice for 15 min, cells were lysed by addition of 120 μl of Nonidet P-40 followed by vortexing for 10 s. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 s at room temperature and extracted by addition of buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The nuclear lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and stored at −80 °C. Western blot analysis of Jurkat cell lysates was carried out as described previously (29Dittmer J. Pise-Masison C.A. Clemens K.E. Choi K.S. Brady J.N. J. Biol.

Rabbit anti-Ets1 (C-20), anti-Ets1/2 (C-275), or anti-Elf-1 (C-20) serum, all provided by Santa Cruz Biotechnology, or mouse anti-Tax1 was diluted to 1:7500, 1:1000, 1:4000, or 1:300, respectively, prior to use. Anti-IgG horseradish peroxidase and ECL reagents were obtained from Amersham Corp. Ets1 baculovirus extract (47Bosselut R. Duvall J.F. Gegonne A. Bailly M. Hemar A. Brady J. Ghysdael J.

For competition experiments, an IL-5 specific oligonucleotide carrying a C to A mutation at −44 (IL-5 EM) or unlabeled IL-5 WT was used in a 100-fold molar excess over the probe. Electrophoresis was carried out as described (49Dittmer J. Gegonne A. Gitlin S.D. Ghysdael J. Brady J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21428-21434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first studied the ability of Ets1 to regulate the activity of the human IL-5 promoter. Jurkat T-cells were transiently transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid pIL5P.luc containing a −494/+44 fragment of the IL-5 promoter either in the presence or absence of an expression plasmid coding for p54ets1(pKCR3-c-ets1). As shown in Fig.1 A, Ets1 was able to increase IL-5 promoter activity approximately 3-fold, when cells were simultaneously treated with PMA and ionomycin. Withdrawal of either one or both of these agents prevented activation of the IL-5 promoter by Ets1. In addition to ionomycin, HTLV-I Tax1 was able to act in concert with PMA to stimulate Ets1 activity (Fig. 1 B). For this stimulatory effect on Ets1, Tax1 had to be active, as two inactive Tax1 mutants, M5 and M7 Tax1(43Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), failed to support trans-activation of the IL-5 promoter by Ets1 (Fig. 1 C). At the same time, wild-type and mutant Tax1 were expressed at the same level (Fig.1 F). Importantly, p54ets1 expression was not altered by any of these treatments (Fig. 1, D and E). Note, however, that ionomycin affected the production of three smaller proteins (I-III) that could be recognized by the Ets1 antibody (Fig. 1 E). These proteins probably resulted from an exon VII domain-dependent/calcium-triggered degradation of p54ets1 (50Rabault B. Ghysdael J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28143-28151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Pognonec P. Boulukos K.E. Gesquiere J.C. Stehelin D. Ghysdael J.

A. 1990; 87: 3723-3727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a process that Tax1 apparently could partially prevent (Fig. 1 E, compare lanes 2and 4 with 3 and 5). When we repeated the experiments with the natural ΔVII Ets1 mutant protein p46ets1, we found that exon VII indeed was required for the production of proteins I-III, but was dispensable for Ets1 activation of the IL-5 promoter (data not shown). This demonstrates that proteins I-III were not important for the Ets1 effect on the IL-5 promoter. Collectively, these data show that certain conditions were required to allow Ets1 activation of the IL-5 promoter in Jurkat cells. Tax1 was able to increase IL-5 promoter activity 20-fold, when cells were treated with either PMA alone or PMA plus ionomycin (Fig. 1 B). In the presence of PMA alone, a cooperative effect of Ets1 with Tax1 was observed. Western blot analysis showed that PMA had a strong up-regulating effect on cytomegalovirus-promoter driven Tax1 expression (Fig.1 G) suggesting that PMA was mainly required to obtain Tax1 protein levels sufficient for trans-activation. The −494/+44 IL-5 promoter fragment contains eight GGA(A/T) core motifs (E), all of which could potentially interact with Ets1 (Fig.2 A). To analyze the importance of the Cle0 GGAA motif for Ets1-mediated activation, we first removed the sequence between −494 and −106 (Fig. 2 A). This deletion altered neither Ets1- nor Tax1-dependent activation (Fig. 2 C). This suggests that the seven GGA(A/T) motifs upstream of nucleotide of position −106 were dispensable for stimulation of promoter activity by these proteins. However, compared with the −494/+44 IL-5 promoter, the −106/+44 promoter fragment had a reduced ability to respond to PMA plus ionomycin. This is likely due to the fact that the ionomycin-responsive NFAT site at −116 is missing in the smaller promoter construct (Fig. 2 A). On the other hand, removal of the NFAT site did not impair the ability of the IL-5 promoter to respond to Ets1 in a PMA/ionomycin-dependent manner. This suggests that ionomycin had two different effects on the IL-5 promoter. One was required for activation of the promoter by Ets1, while the other was likely to be mediated by activation of NFAT. We next mutated the GGAA motif of the Cle0 element to AGAA (Fig.2 B), thereby, creating the Ets-binding mutant −106/+44 EM IL-5 promoter (Fig. 2 A). As shown in Fig. 2 D, this mutation completely abrogated the ability of Ets1 to trans-activate the IL-5 promoter. To demonstrate that Ets1 can specifically interact with the GGAA motif of the IL-5 Cle0 element, EMSAs were performed using a32P-labeled oligonucleotide that corresponded to the IL-5 promoter sequence between −63 and −37. By using a p54ets1-enriched baculovirus extract, we could show that Ets1 was able to bind to this probe (Fig. 2 E, lane 2). The formation of the Ets1 complex could be prevented by the addition of unlabeled wild type −63/−37 oligonucleotide (IL-5 WT) (lane 3), but not by adding an Ets mutant version of this oligonucleotide (IL-5 EM) that contained a mutation at the first G of the GGAA motif (lane 4). These results show that Ets1 interacts with the IL-5 Cle0 element by contacting its GGAA motif. These data suggest that responsiveness of the IL-5 promoter to Ets1 relied on the Ets-binding site within the Cle0 element. The G to A mutation of the Cle0 Ets-binding site not only inhibited the activation of the IL-5 promoter by Ets1, but also interfered with the ability of Tax1 to stimulate IL-5 promoter activity (Fig. 2 D). This suggests that the stimulatory effect of Tax1 on the IL-5 promoter required an Ets protein already present in Jurkat T-cells. Full-length Ets1 and ΔVII Ets1 are endogenously expressed in Jurkat cells (Fig.3 A). Treatment with PMA or PMA plus ionomycin, which allowed Tax1 to trans-activate the IL-5 promoter, did not significantly change the expression levels of these Ets1 proteins relative to control conditions (Fig.3 A). Therefore, it is possible that Tax1cooperated with Jurkat cell-derived Ets1, when no Ets1 had been added exogenously. Alternatively, a different Ets transcription factor, such as Ets2 or Elf-1, which are also expressed by Jurkat cells (Fig.3 B), could instead have mediated the effect of Tax1 on the IL-5 promoter. To study this possibility we tested the effects of ectopically expressed Ets2 and Elf-1 on the IL-5 promoter. We found that Ets2 was twice as potent as Ets1 in its ability to activate the IL-5 promoter in Jurkat cells, causing a 6–10-fold increase in promoter activity in the presence of PMA plus ionomycin (Fig. 4 A) or PMA plus Tax1 (Fig. 4 B), respectively. Interestingly, the cooperative effect of Ets2 with Tax1 was stronger than that of Ets1 with Tax1 (Fig. 4 B). Ets2 also had a significant stimulatory effect on the promoter in the presence of PMA alone (Fig. 4 A).Figure 4In addition to Ets1, Ets2, but not Elf-1, is able to activate the IL-5 promoter. Transient transfection experiments were performed with Jurkat cells as described under “Materials and Methods.” Each bar represents the average value of two to three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Elf-1, although able to activate the IL-5 promoter in cells treated with PMA, failed to stimulate IL-5 promoter activity in the presence of PMA plus ionomycin or PMA plus Tax1 (Fig. 4 A). Interestingly, the PMA/Tax1-mediated activation was even inhibited by Elf-1 (Fig. 4 B). These data show that, in addition to Ets1, Ets2 is able to activate the IL-5 promoter, while Elf-1 lacks this ability and rather seems to have the potential to repress Tax1-induced IL-5 promoter activity. In the myeloid Kasumi cell line, Ets1 and Tax1 were found to be unable to activate the IL-5 promoter under the conditions that allowed these proteins to stimulate promoter activity in Jurkat cells (Fig. 5). This may suggest that a T-cell specific factor may have played a role in Tax1- and Ets1-mediated activation of the IL-5 promoter in Jurkat cells. A potential candidate is the T-cell specific factor GATA3, which is highly expressed in Jurkat T-cells (17Yamagata T. Mitani K. Ueno H. Kanda Y. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4272-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 54Ho I-C. Vorhess P. Marin N. Karpinsky-Oakley B. Tsai S-F. Orkin S.H. Leiden J.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1187-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and is able to activate the IL-5 promoter through a proximal GATA site (Fig.2 A), shown to be critical for IL-5 promoter activity (15Zhang M. Maass N. Magit D. Sager R. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 179-186PubMed Google Scholar). By Western blot analyses of unfractionated and fast protein liquid chromatography fractionated nuclear extracts, we confirmed that GATA3 is endogenously expressed in Jurkat cells (data not shown). To test the ability of GATA3 to rescue Ets1/2 and Tax1 stimulatory activity we analyzed the effects of Ets1/2, Elf-1, and Tax1on the −494/+44 IL-5 promoter in myeloid Kasumi cells, when GATA3 was overexpressed. As shown in Fig. 5, overexpression of GATA3 had no effect on the IL-5 promoter (Fig. 5). However, when combined with Ets1 in the presence of PMA a 3-fold increase in promoter activity was observed. This suggests that Ets1 was able to cooperate with GATA3 to trans-activate the IL-5 promoter. Further addition of Tax1or ionomycin strongly increased this effect resulting in a 14- or 11-fold induction of promoter activity, respectively. Neither Ets1 nor GATA3 alone was able to efficiently activate the IL-5 promoter under these conditions. This shows that Tax1 and ionomycin could only exert their effects on Ets1 and GATA3, when both of these transcription factors were present. It suggests that Tax1and ionomycin strengthened the functional interaction between Ets1 and GATA3. Similar to Ets1, Ets2 was unable to activate the IL-5 promoter in Kasumi cells, unless GATA3 was added (Fig. 5). However, the cooperative effect of Ets2 with GATA3 was stronger relative to that of Ets1 leading to an 11-fold induction of IL-5 promoter activity in the presence of PMA, as compared with a 3-fold stimulation by Ets1 under the same conditions. Addition of Tax1 or ionomycin further increased promoter activity 4- or 2-fold, respectively. As found with Jurkat cells, under optimum conditions, Ets2 was twice as effective as Ets1 in activating the IL-5 promoter. Interestingly, compared with Ets1, Ets2 also seemed to be the better partner for Tax1, as Ets2 could synergize with Tax1 even in the absence of GATA3. These data suggest that the interactions of Ets2 with GATA3 and Tax1 may be stronger than those of Ets1 with these proteins. In the presence of PMA alone or PMA plus ionomycin, Elf-1 induced IL-5 promoter activity by approximately 2-fold, while it activated the promoter 3-fold in Kasumi cells treated with PMA plus Tax1. However, under any of these conditions, co-expression with GATA3 did not further increase promoter activity, suggesting that Elf-1 is unable to act in synergy with GATA3. Similar data were obtained, when the experiments were repeated with the −106/+44 IL-5 promoter fragment (data not shown). However, when the Ets mutant 106/+44 EM promoter fragment was used instead, Ets1 and Ets2 failed to synergize with GATA3 and/or Tax1 (data not shown). These results show that the Cle0 Ets-binding site is essential for cooperative effects of Ets1 or Ets2 with GATA3 and/or Tax1. We show here for the first time that in the presence of PMA, Ets1 and Ets2, but not Elf-1, are able to cooperate with GATA3 to synergistically activate the IL-5 promoter. Our results further suggest that Tax1 or ionomycin can enhance this Ets/GATA3 synergy. Based on these data, we propose that IL-5 expression is regulated by the concerted action of at least three transcription factors, Ets1/2, AP1, and GATA3, whose combined activities can be modulated by Tax1 or by a putative ionomycin-regulated cellular factor (Fig. 6). In this model, we suggest PMA to be needed for recruitment of AP1 to the Cle0 element. Both Ets1 and Ets2 are able to cooperate with AP1 to activate a variety of promoters and to mediate PMA-dependent activation (15Zhang M. Maass N. Magit D. Sager R. Cell Growth Differ."

Wild-type moesin molecules interact poorly with F-actin and each other, and bind neither C- nor N-terminal fragments. Interaction with F-actin is strongly enhanced by replacement of Thr558 with aspartate (T558D), by deletion of 11 N-terminal residues (DelN11), by deletion of the entire N-terminal membrane-binding domain of both wild type and T558D mutant molecules, and by exposure to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate. Activation of F-actin binding is accompanied by changes in inter- and intramolecular domain interactions. The T558D mutation renders moesin capable of binding wild type but not mutated (T558D) C-terminal or wild type N-terminal fragments. The interaction between the latter two is prevented. DelN11 truncation enables binding of wild type N and C domain fragments. These changes suggest that the T558D mutation, mimicking phosphorylation of Thr558, promotes F-actin binding by disruption of interdomain interactions between N and C domains and exposure of the high affinity F-actin binding site in the C-terminal domain.

Moesin is one of several closely related and widely expressed proteins (1Lankes W.T. Furthmayr H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8279-8301Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 2Funayama N.

They include ezrin and radixin and share ∼75% overall sequence identity and regions, denoted A–H, of even higher structural conservation (4Lankes W. Schwartz-Albiez R. Furthmayr H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A common secondary structure is predicted to consist of a 320-residue globular N-terminal domain, a central ∼200-residue predominantly α-helical region, and a ∼50-residue highly charged C-terminal domain. Based on a large body of evidence, these proteins bind to components of the cell membrane with the N-terminal domain (5Amieva M.R. Litman P. Huang L. Ichimaru E. Furthmayr H. J.

This sequence differs in the tumor suppressor merlin, and while F-actin binds to the moesin sequence, it does not bind to merlin under the same conditions (23Huang L. Ichimaru E. Pestonjamasp K.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Interactions of proteins in the cell cortex underlie a variety of cellular responses, such as changes in cell shape, adhesion, movement, and signal transduction. The function of moesin in these dynamic processes at the membrane/cytoskeletal interface very likely depends on regulation of its binding activities (28Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31377-31385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 29Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Several proposals have been made, but it has not been firmly established as yet how the linkage function of moesin operates and how it is regulated in cells. In vitro experiments have demonstrated homotypic and heterotypic associations between ezrin and moesin and small amounts of dimeric molecules have been isolated from cell lysates by immunoprecipitation (30Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 31Berryman M. Gary R. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This, combined with the fact that isolated N and C domains of these proteins interact, has led to the suggestion that oligomers are functionally important and that they are formed by disruption of an intramolecular interaction between N-terminal and C-terminal domains (30Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 32Martin M. Andreoli C. Sahuquet A. Montcourrier P. Algrain M. Mangeat P. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25324-25327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea is that the binding sites mediating this head-to-tail association are masked in the full-length protein, when tested for interaction of full-length molecules with either C or N domains (30Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). A second proposal has been that phosphorylation activates binding functions of moesin. In human platelets, for instance, thrombin activation leads to a rapid, but transient, increase in the phosphorylation of a single threonine, Thr558, in the C-terminal domain and near the presumptive location of the F-actin binding site (20Pestonjamasp K. Amieva M.R. Strassel C.P. Nauseef W.M. Furthmayr H. Luna E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 28Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31377-31385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This residue is conserved in moesin, ezrin, and radixin, and it is modified also in RAW macrophages (34Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Hirota C. Mizuno Y. Furthmayr H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), Swiss3T3 cells (29Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J.

Furthmayr, unpublished observations.3E. Ichimaru and H. Furthmayr, unpublished observations. Phosphorylation at this site is regulated by the activity of Rho, and Rho-associated kinase phosphorylates two residues in the C-terminal region, one of which is Thr558 (29Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Thr558 can also be phosphorylated by θ-phosphokinase C (35Pietromonaco S.F. Simons P.C. Altman A. Elias L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7594-7603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of this conserved amino acid by Rho-associated kinase prevents interaction of the phosphorylated C domain with the N-terminal domain (29Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) but does not appear to influence binding of the isolated C domain to F-actin. Other than Thr558, the role of phosphorylation of specific tyrosine, serine, or other threonine residues in response to stimulation by growth factors, histamine, or lysophosphatidic acid has not been established (36Urushidani T.

Cell. 1998; 9: 403-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Thr558 of moesin is of significance in human platelets, because it is modulated by physiological activation, it can be manipulated by protein kinase and phosphatase inhibitors, and it is accompanied by changes in moesin distribution and platelet morphology (28Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31377-31385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We believe that phosphorylation of Thr558can be mimicked by replacement of threonine with aspartate, and the present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that this modification activates the F-actin binding function of moesin. We show that Thr558 substitution greatly enhances F-actin binding activity of moesin by comparing the actin filament binding properties of wild type moesin and a series of mutants by blot overlay and co-sedimentation assays and by examining in detail interdomain and intermolecular interactions by in vitro assays and with the yeast two-hybrid system in vivo. Furthermore, we present several lines of strong evidence that this activation step is linked to the disruption of interactions between the N- and C-terminal domains. This in turn changes the overall conformation of the protein and exposes the high affinity binding site in the C-terminal domain. Mutations of moesin Thr558within the sequence KYKT558L were introduced into moesin cDNA by PCR 4The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate; kb, kilobase pair(s)using oligonucleotides as primers that specify both the desired mutation and carry a convenient restriction site to facilitate subcloning and isolation of mutant clones. The following oligonucleotides were synthesized: A, GEX5′(+) (5′-CCAAAATCGGATCTGGTTCCG-3′); B, MSN T558D Bgl2(−) (5′-CCGGATCTGGCGCAGATCTTTGTATTTGTCTCGGCC-3′); C, MSN T558D Bgl2(+) (5′-GGCCGAGACAAATACAAAGATCTGCGCCAGATCCGG-3′); D, GEX3′Aat2(−) (5′-CTCTCAAGGATCTTACCGCTG-3′); E, MSN T558AHindII(−) (5′-CCGGATCTGGCGCAAAGCTTTGTATTTGTCTCGGC-3′); F, MSN T558AHindII(+) (5′-GCCGAGACAAATACAAAGCTTTGCGCCAGATCCGG-3′); G, MSN3′SalI(−) (5′-AATTTTAGGTCAGTCGACATCCCTGGAG-3′); H, MSN DK5 PvuI(−) (5′-GCGCAGGGTCTTGTATCGATCGCGGCCCAGTCGCATGT-3′); I, MSN DK5PvuI(+) (5′-CGAGACAAATACAAGACGATCGCCAGATCCGGCAG-3′). To substitute Thr558 with Asp (D), two PCR reactions were performed using pGhuMo (pGEX-KG-human moesin, or GST-MSN (20Pestonjamasp K. Amieva M.R. Strassel C.P. Nauseef W.M. Furthmayr H. Luna E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar)) plasmid DNA as template with oligonucleotides A and B as primers in reaction 1, and C and D in reaction 2. The product of reaction 1 was digested with BglII yielding a 1.1-kb fragment, and the product of reaction 2 gave a 0.5-kb fragment by digestion withBglII and AatII. The two fragments were then subcloned by three-way ligation into pGhuMo that had been predigested with BglII and AatII to delete the C-terminal portion of moesin. This resulted in pKG-MSNT558D (GST-MSNT558D). To substitute Thr558 with Ala, two PCRs were performed. In reaction 1, pGhuMo served as template, and oligonucleotides A and E served as primers. In reaction 2, UIII (Ref. 3Gould K.L. Bretscher A. Esch F.S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4133-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar; human moesin in pBSSK+) served as template, and F and G served as primers. Reaction 1 yielded a 1.1-kb BglII–HindIII fragment, and reaction 2 yielded a 0.5-kbHindIII–SalI fragment. These two fragments were subcloned by three-way ligation intoBglII/SalI-predigested pGhuMo to delete the C-terminal portion of moesin and to generate pKG-MSNT558A (GST-MSNT558A). To delete KYKT558L, two PCRs were performed with oligonucleotides A and H as primers in reaction 1 and I and D in reaction 2 using pGhuMo as template. The first reaction yielded a 1.1-kb BglII–PvuI fragment, and the second yielded a 0.5-kb PvuI–AatII fragment. The two fragments were subcloned by three-way ligation intoBglII/AatII-predigested pGhuMo to result in pKG-MSNΔK5 (GST-MSNΔK5). pKG-MSNT558A was digested with HindIII to delete the C-terminal 19 codons and recircularized to generate pKG-MSNΔC19 (GST-MSNΔC19). pKG-MSNT558D was digested with BglII to delete encoding residues 198–558 and recircularized to generate pKG-MSNΔ(L198-T558) (GST-MSNΔm). pKG-MSNc (GST-moesin C-terminal region residues 404–577) was constructed by inserting the EcoRI–XhoI fragment from MSNc/pCR3 (see below) into pGEX-KG. pKG-MSNn (GST-moesin N-terminal region residues 1–310) was generated by subcloning the EcoRI–SalI fragment from pAS1-MSNn (see below) into pGEX-KG. pKG-EZR (GST-EZR1–586(P4T,N6S)) and pKG-EZRn (GST-EZR1–310(P4T,N6S)) were constructed by replacing the moesinNcoI–NcoI or NcoI–SalI fragment in pKG-MSN with the human ezrinNcoI–NcoI or NcoI–SalI (from pAS1-EZRn)2 fragments, respectively. pG3X-EZRc (GST-EZR280–586) was made by inserting the ezrin C-terminalBamHI–BamHI fragment into pGEX-3X vector. pKG-RDX (GST-RDX1–583) was as described by Pestonjamasp et al. (20Pestonjamasp K. Amieva M.R. Strassel C.P. Nauseef W.M. Furthmayr H. Luna E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). pKG-RDXn (GST-RDX1–449) was generated by deleting the pig radixin C-terminal HindIII–HindIII fragment from pKG-RDX and recircularizing the plasmid. pKG-RDXc (GST-RDX373–583) was constructed by subcloning the C-terminalXbaI–XhoI fragment from pKG-RDX into pGEX-KG. PGEX-NF2 (GST-merlin) and pGEX-NFc (GST-merlin C-terminal region, residues 254–595) were as described by Huang et al.(23Huang L. Ichimaru E. Pestonjamasp K. Cui X. Nakamura H. Lo G.Y.H. Lin F.I.K. Luna E.J. Furthmayr H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To confirm the correct sequence, all PCR-derived mutants were sequenced using the ABI PRISM DYE Terminator cycle sequencing system (Perkin-Elmer). Wild type and mutated moesin cDNAs were subcloned into derivatives of pET vectors (Stratagene) carrying a T7 promoter for expression of untagged moesin proteins in Escherichia coli and in vitro (41Blacklow S. Kim P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The NdeI–HindIII fragment from pGhuMo, pKG-MSNT558D, and pKG-MSNΔK5 was cloned into pETNde to generate MSN/pET, MSNT558D/pET, and MSNΔK5/pET, respectively. The longerNdeI–HindIII fragment, obtained from pKG-MSNT558A by partial digest with HindIII, was cloned into pETNde to generate MSNT558A/pET. The shorterNdeI–HindIII fragment was cloned into pETNde to make MSNΔC19. The NcoI–NcoI fragment from UIII was cloned into pETNco to generate MSNΔN11/pET. TheEcoRI–XhoI fragment encoding full-length moesin from pGhuMo was subcloned into pCR3 (InVitrogen) to generate MSN/pCR3. The C-terminal PstI–XhoI fragment from pGhuMo was subcloned into pCR3 to make MSNc/pCR3 encoding residues 421–577 with codon 421 as the initiation methionine. Likewise, thePstI–XhoI fragment from pKG-MSNT558D was subcloned into pCR3 to generate MSNcT558D/pCR3. MSNn/pCR3 encoding moesin's N-terminal region residues 1–310 was generated by digesting MSNn-GFP/pCR32 with SmaI and EcoRV (to delete GFP) and recircularization. TheNcoI–NcoI fragment from UIII was inserted into pAS1 and pACT2 to create pAS1-MSNΔn11 (G4BD-HA-moesin12–577) and pACT2-MSNΔn11 (G4AD-HA-moesin12–577), respectively. pAS1-MSNΔn11 and pACT2-MSNΔn11 were digested with SmaI to delete the C-terminal domain and recircularized to generate pAS1-MSNnΔ11 (G4BD-HA-moesinN12–310) and pACT2-MSNnΔ (G4AD-HA-moesinN12–310), respectively. pACT2-MSN (G4AD-HA-moesin) and pACT2-MSNT558D (G4AD-HA-moesin T558D mutant) were constructed by subcloning into pACT2 theEcoRI–XhoI fragment from pGhuMo and pKG-MSNT558D, respectively. pACT2-MSNc (G4AD-HA-moesin C-(404–577)) and pACT2-MSNcT558D (G4AD-HA-moesin C-(404–577/T558D)) were generated by subcloning theEcoRI–XhoI fragment from MSNc/pCR3 and MSNcT558D/pCR3 into pACT2. pACT2-MSNcΔK5 (G4AD-HA-moesin C/KYKTL deleted) and pACT2-MSNcΔc19 (G4AD-HA-moesin C-(1–558)/19 residues truncated) were constructed by subcloning the EcoRI–XhoI fragment from GFP-MSNcΔK5/pCR3 and GFP-MSNcΔc19 into pACT2.2 pAS1-MSN (G4BD-moesin) was constructed by subcloning theBamHI–XhoI fragment, excised from pACT2-MSN by partial digest with BamHI and XhoI into pAS1-NF2 (23Huang L. Ichimaru E. Pestonjamasp K. Cui X. Nakamura H. Lo G.Y.H. Lin F.I.K. Luna E.J. Furthmayr H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and predigested with BamHI and SalI (to delete NF2). pAS1-MSNT558D (G4BD-moesin T558D mutant) was created by replacing theNdeI–SalI fragment in pAS1-MSN with theNdeI–SalI fragment from pKG-MSNT558D. pAS1-MSNc (G4BD-moesin C-(404–577)) was made by subcloning theBamHI–XhoI fragment from pACT2-MSNc into pAS1-NF2 predigested with BamHI and SalI (to delete NF2). pACT2-MSNn (G4AD-HA-moesinN1–310) was generated by subcloning theEcoRI–SalI fragment from pAS1-MSNn into pACT2 cut with EcoRI and XhoI. pAS1-MSNn (G4BD-HA-moesin N-terminal region 1–310) was constructed by subcloning the SmaI–SmaI fragment from pACT2-MSN into pAS1. It was not suitable for the study because of high background signal in yeast two-hybrid assays. GST-moesin fusions were expressed in E. colitransformed with corresponding plasmids according to the instructions (Pharmacia Biotech Biotech). Untagged moesin proteins were expressed inE. coli strain BL21(DE3) transformed with pET plasmids carrying moesin inserts according to instructions (Stratagene, Palo Alto, CA). The recombinant moesin proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Coomassie staining, and Western blot as described previously using rabbit polyclonal antibody pAs90–7 (8Amieva M.R. Furthmayr H. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) to verify the expression of desired proteins. Before use for F-actin blot overlay, the recombinant proteins were quantitated by Western blot followed by densitometry and using known amounts of moesin to construct a standard curve. Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were incubated in TTBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 0.005% sodium azide overnight at 4 °C and in blocking buffer (TTBS containing 5% dry milk and 0.005% sodium azide) overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TTBS, the blots were probed with [α-32P]ATP- or [α-35S]ATP-labeled F-actin (27Mackay D.J.G. Esch F. Furthmayr H. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). A. Spudich (Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University) generously supplied rabbit skeletal muscle actin. The probe was prepared as follows. 66 μm G-actin was gel-filtered into G buffer (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 μmCaCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm NaN3) to reduce the concentration of free ATP and then incubated for 120 min at room temperature with 125 μCi ([α-32P]ATP at 800 Ci/mm, or [α-35S]ATP at >1000 Ci/mm). Actin polymerization was initiated by the addition of 0.1 volume of 0.5m KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2 (10× F buffer) and continued for 20 min at room temperature, after which F-actin was sedimented at 100,000 × g for 30 min. An estimated 70% of the isotope was incorporated into the F-actin pellet. The F-actin was resuspended at 20 μg/ml in F buffer containing 5 mmphalloidin and 1 mm dithiothreitol. For blot overlay, the protein was resuspended at 20 μg/ml in Western blocking buffer (TTBS; 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2% Tween 20, 5% fat-free milk powder) containing 5 μmphalloidin and 1 mm dithiothreitol and incubated with preblocked Western blots for 2 h at room temperature. Blots were washed in TTBS four times for 5 min at room temperature and then exposed to film at −80 °C. Co-sedimentation ofin vitro translated, 35S-labeled moesin with polymerized F-actin was based on reported methods (42Hug C. Miller T.M. Torres M.A. Casella J.F. Cooper J.A. J.

Phosphatidylinositol (PI) or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (PIP2) (Sigma) was dissolved in distilled water to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and sonicated three times each for 10 s. In vitro translated proteins were incubated with or without 50 μg/ml PI or PIP2 in polymerization buffer (100 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% NaN3, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 0.75% Triton X-100 for 10 min and centrifuged at 150,000 × gfor 30 min in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge using Ultra-Clear centrifuge tubes (5 × 41 mm) and a TLA-100.3 rotor to clear protein aggregates. The supernatants were incubated with or without 0.5 mg/ml F-actin in polymerization buffer containing 0.75% Triton X-100 for 30 min, transferred into centrifuge tubes with or without underlying 20% sucrose in polymerization buffer, and centrifuged again as above. Aliquots of the supernatants and pellets that had been rinsed with polymerization buffer were solubilized by boiling in SDS sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, and the35S-labeled protein bands were quantitated by densitometry. Identical results were obtained with or without the 20% sucrose cushion, and those without are presented. pET or pCR3 plasmids carrying moesin inserts were transcribed and translatedin vitro using a TNT coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of T7 RNA polymerase andl-[35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro translation products with or without 50 μg/ml PI or PIP2 were incubated with GST fusion proteins, which had been immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, in binding buffer (200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.2% Triton X-100) at 4 °C. After 1.5 h, the beads were washed six times in binding buffer. Bound proteins were boiled in SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to autoradiography. Pairs of hybrid plasmids were transformed (45Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar) into the yeast reporter strain Y190 (46Durfee T.

Single colonies were patched onto selective plates, incubated at 30 °C for 3 days, and subjected to a filter lift assay for β-galactosidase activity (46Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H.

As a first step, a series of mutations of Thr558 and flanking sequences were introduced into moesin by polymerase chain reaction, and the mutants were subcloned to yield GST fusion proteins. Mutant and wild-type GST-moesin were then expressed in E. coli, and effects of the mutation on F-actin binding were examined by F-actin blot overlay with 32P- (27Mackay D.J.G. Esch F. Furthmayr H"
https://openalex.org/W2157193683,"We have reported in this paper the complete cDNA sequence, gene structure, and tissue-specific expression of LOXL2, a new amine oxidase and a member of an emerging family of human lysyl oxidases. The predicted amino acid sequence, from several overlapping cDNA clones isolated from placenta and spleen cDNA libraries, shared extensive sequence homology with the conserved copper-binding and catalytic domains of both lysyl oxidase (LOX) and the lysyl oxidase-like (LOXL) protein. These conserved domains are encoded by five consecutive exons within the LOX,LOXL, and LOXL2 genes that also maintained exon-intron structure conservation. In contrast, six exons encoding the amino-terminal domains diverged both in sequence and structure. Exon 1 of the LOXL2 gene does not encode a signal sequence that is present in LOX and LOXL, suggesting a different processing and intracellular localization for this new protein. Expression of the LOXL2 gene was detected in almost all tissues with the highest steady state mRNA levels in the reproductive tissues, placenta, uterus and prostate. In situ hybridization identified placental syncytial and cytotrophoblasts responsible for the synthesis of LOXL2mRNA and demonstrated a spatial and temporal expression pattern unique to the LOXL2 gene.

Lysyl oxidase is a copper-dependent amine oxidase that belongs to a heterogeneous family of enzymes that oxidize primary amine substrates to reactive aldehydes. This enzyme family is subdivided into two main classes on the basis of the chemical nature of the co-factors associated with these amine oxidases. Flavine adenine dinucleotide is the co-factor of monoamine oxidase and of an intracellular form of polyamine oxidase. A second group of amine oxidases contain topaquinone, a modified tyrosine side chain utilized as a redox co-factor. Diamine oxidase, monoamine-metabolizing semi-carbazide-sensitive amine oxidase, and lysyl oxidase belong to this latter subfamily of amine oxidases (1Janes S.M. Palcic M.M. Scaman C.H. Smith C.H.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Most of the studies on lysyl oxidase have focused on the specific cross-linking activity and catalytic mechanism of action of this enzyme on the extracellular matrix substrates, collagen and elastin. Lysyl oxidase participates in the critical post-translational modification essential to the biogenesis of connective tissue by deaminating the side chains of lysine residues in these proteins, thus catalyzing the covalent cross-linking of several fibrillar collagen types and the formation of desmosine and isodesmosine cross-links in elastin (4Kagan H.M.

Recently, multiple novel biological functions have been attributed to lysyl oxidase (6Contente S. Kenyon K. Rimoldi D. Friedman R.M. Science. 1990; 249: 796-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 7Kenyon K. Contente S. Trackman P.C. Tang J. Kagan H.M. Friedman R.M. Science. 1991; 253: 802Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) that have suggested that other intracellular and intranuclear substrates may be involved in these multiple functions (8Li W.

Benson S. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 173: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) to tumor suppression (7Kenyon K. Contente S. Trackman P.C. Tang J. Kagan H.M. Friedman R.M.

Rep. 1996; 23: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). An attractive hypothesis to explain how a single protein can fulfill these different functions is that a family of several different lysyl oxidases may exist that individually function to perform these roles. Over the past few years, we and others have described two lysyl oxidase-related proteins that fulfill all the requirements of being functional copper-dependent, but genetically distinct, lysyl oxidases that could potentially serve as the basis for a family of proteins present in a variety of cellular and tissue locations, each with an unique function. The first of these LOX 1The abbreviations used are: LOX, lysyl oxidase; LOXL, lysyl oxidase-like; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s); UTR, untranslated region; PAC, bacteriophage P1-derived vector-related proteins was called LOXL or lysyl oxidase-like (17Kenyon K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7176-7182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A comparison of the cDNA sequence of LOXL and LOX confirmed a significant homology within the carboxyl-terminal end of these proteins. This homology included a striking conservation of the copper binding site, the catalytic domain, and the carbonyl co-factor binding site. This domain conservation was also reflected in conservation of exon size and exon-intron boundaries in five of the seven exons in both of the LOX and LOXL genes encoding these conserved domains (18Kim Y. Boyd C.D. Csiszar K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7176-7182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Boyd C.D. Mariani T.J. Kim Y. Csiszar K. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have also mapped this LOXLgene to chromosome 15q23 (20Szabo Z. Light E. Boyd C.D. Csiszar K. Hum. Genet. 1997; 101: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and the LOX gene was previously mapped to chromosome 5q23.3 (21Mariani T.J. Trackman P.C. Kagan H.M. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B.

Genomics. 1991; 11: 508-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We have, moreover, localized the LOXL protein to sites of de novo fibrosis in the liver and showed co-regulated expression of the LOXLgene with the colIIIA1 gene and the LOX gene with the gene encoding pro-α1(I) collagen. These results suggested different functions for LOX and LOXL (23Kim Y. Peyrol S. So C.K. Boyd C.D. Csiszar K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 72: 181-188Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We now report the detailed structural and expression analysis of a new member of the lysyl oxidase gene family encoding a protein we have referred to as LOXL2. The unique temporal and spatial tissue-specific expression pattern in reproductive tissues and the possible intracellular localization of LOXL2 indicate a role for LOXL2 that is distinctly different from either LOX or LOXL. DNA sequence obtained from Human Genome Sciences (Applied Biosystems) expressed sequence tag clone HSSAE08RB provided information for the design of PCR primers, and we have used these primers to screen a human spleen cDNA library (cDNA Isolation Service, Life Technologies, Inc.). A human placenta library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was also screened using aLOXL2-specific PCR-amplified cDNA probe. The primers used to generate this probe were LOXL2–34 (5′ CTG GTG CGA CTG AGA GGC G 3′) and LOXL2–35 (5′ GAA GGC GTT GCT GGC GAA TC 3′). The probe was random primer-labeled, and filters with phage plaque lifts were hybridized overnight at 42 °C, followed by four washes for 30 min each at room temperature in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and two washes for 30 min at 50 °C in 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS. Positive phages were purified, and the inserts were excised and sequenced. Two overlapping PAC clones, 17459 and 17460 (Genome Systems, Inc., St Louis, MO), containing theLOXL2 gene were used as templates for DNA sequencing using the Thermo Sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Oligonucleotides were designed based on LOXL2 cDNA sequences and synthesized by Genosys Biotechnologies Inc. (The Woodlands, TX) and Life Technologies, Inc. Sequencing reactions were performed using 32.5 fm PAC DNA in a reaction mixture containing the following reagents: 2 μm each dATP, dGTP, dTTP, dCTP, 8 units of Thermo Sequenase, 26 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 6.5 mm MgCl2, 0.45 μCi of [33P]ddGTP, ddATP, ddTTP, and ddCTP. Each reaction was terminated, and aliquots were loaded on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, gels were exposed for 2 days at −80 °C using Kodak X-Omat film. Exon sizes were determined by genomic DNA sequencing from PAC clones 17459 and 17460. Intron sizes were determined using sets of primers that corresponded to 5′ and 3′ end sequences of previously identified exons of the LOXL2cDNA and DNA from PAC clone 17459 and PAC clone 17460. Polymerase chain reactions were performed using the GeneAmp kit (Perkin-Elmer) with the following parameters: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min was followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at primer-specific temperatures (between 52 and 66 °C) for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min with a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR reactions were performed using 80 ng of DNA in 25 μl of reaction mixture containing final concentrations of the following reagents: PCR buffer from Perkin-Elmer containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmeach of dGTP, dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and 0.625 unit of Taqpolymerase. Amplified products were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels, and size-separated DNA fragments were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Primer extension was performed on 5 μg of total RNA from human placenta. 32P-Labeled antisense primers LOXL2-2 (5′-TAC CGA GCT TAG GCT TA-3′) and LOXL2-18 5′-CAC GAA CAG TGT CTA GAC GA-3′) were annealed, and extension reactions were performed for 50 min at 42 °C with 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and terminated for 15 min at 70 °C. These extension products were treated with RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C, extracted with phenol, precipitated, re-dissolved, and subjected to electrophoresis through an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. A sequencing reaction performed on PAC clone 17460 using primers LOXL2-2 or LOXL2-18 was loaded on the same gel. Extension reactions lacking either RNA or primers were used as controls. Two-μg aliquots of size-separated poly(A)+ RNA obtained from adult heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, prostate, testis, uterus, small intestine, colon, and peripheral blood leukocyte were present in the two Multiple Tissue Northern filters used (CLONTECH). Each Multiple Tissue Northern blot was prehybridized for 30 min at 68 °C in 7 ml of ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH). Hybridization, using 32P-labeled cDNAs prepared by random primer labeling, was carried out in 5 ml of the same solution used for prehybridization at 68 °C for 1 h. The filters were then washed twice in 2 × SSC, 0.5%SDS at room temperature and twice in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C and exposed to Kodak Biomax film for 12 h at −70 °C. The DNA fragments used for radiolabeling were as follows: a 1.36-kb LOXL2 cDNA and a 2.0-kb β-actin cDNA provided with the Multiple Tissue Northern blots. The specific activity of all radiolabeled DNA fragments used in these incubations was 5 × 109 dpm/μg. Placentas with attached fetal membranes and decidua were obtained from a patient after elective pregnancy termination at 14 weeks of gestation and from patient after elective cesarean section at term from Kapiolani Medical Center (Honololu, HI). Tissues were obtained with the approval of the Institutional Review Board and the Human Experimentation Committee of the University of Hawaii. Tissues were transferred to ice within 1 h of removal, and small pieces were cut from the villous placenta, avoiding the chorionic and basal plates. Tissue samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and sections were cut in a cryostat as described previously (24Bogic L.V. Mandel M.B. Bryant-Greenwood G.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 130-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For in situ hybridizations,35S-labeled LOXL2-specific oligomer that corresponded to DNA sequences 2184–2244 bp of the LOXL2cDNA and a complementary control oligomer were incubated with pretreated and prehybridized tissue sections. The specificities of these oligomer probes to the LOXL2 mRNA were confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Following post-hybridization washes and autoradiography, counterstained tissue sections were visualized by dark and bright field microscopy. A search of the Human Genome Sciences Inc. protein data base identified three expressed sequence tag clones with homology to lysyl oxidase. DNA sequence analysis of one of these clones, HSSAE08RB, demonstrated a 45% homology to lysyl oxidase (LOX) and 48% homology to the lysyl oxidase-like (LOXL) cDNA. PCR-derived DNA fragments prepared using this expressed sequence tag sequence information were used to identify 16 cDNA clones from a human spleen cDNA library and an additional 8 clones from a human placenta library. DNA sequencing and alignment of these clones resulted in a full-length cDNA sequence encoding LOXL2. An open reading frame of 1911 bp was identified that clearly demonstrated sequence homology within this LOXL2 cDNA to both LOXand LOXL cDNAs. Conservation of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence within the carboxyl-terminal end of LOXL2, LOX, and LOXL included the copper-binding domain (WEWHSCHQHYH) in LOX and LOXL and WIWHDCHRHYH in LOXL2 with the four histidines that supply the nitrogen ligands for the copper coordination complex specific for lysyl oxidase proteins (26Krebs C.J. Krawetz S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1202: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The active site in LOX (DIDCQWWIDITDVXPGNY) and in LOXL2 (DIDCQWVDITDVPPPGDY) contains, in each, a Tyr residue (Y) at the COOH-terminal end, which is known to participate together with a Lys residue in the formation of the quinone co-factor that is present in these proteins. Ten cysteines characteristic of LOX and LOXL were similarly conserved in LOXL2 (4Kagan H.M. Reddy V.B. Narashimhan N. Csiszar K. Mecham R.P. Roberts L. Molecular Biology and Pathology of Elastic Tissue. Ciba Foundation Symposium Series, Wiley, Chichester, UK1994Google Scholar). A growth factor and cytokine receptor domain present in the LOX and LOXL proteins was also identified within the LOXL2-derived amino acid sequence. This domain is consistent with the consensus sequence C-X 9-C-X-W-X 25–32-C-X 10–15(where X is a defined number of any amino acids) that is a proposed ligand-binding domain for a number of receptors for cytokines and growth hormones (18Kim Y. Boyd C.D. Csiszar K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7176-7182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 27Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 78: 6934-6938Crossref Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). Three repeats of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain were also present at amino acids 13–125, 149–250, and 258–368 in the derived LOXL2 sequence (25Saito H. Papaconstantinou J. Sato H. Goldstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8157-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar,28Resnick D. Pearson A. Krieger M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The hydropathy profile of the LOXL2 protein was determined and compared with that of the LOX and LOXL proteins using the MacMolly analysis program. Unlike other lysyl oxidases, LOXL2 had no obvious evidence for a hydrophobic signal sequence. Three major transcription termination sites were noted within 3′-UTR domains in the 20 LOXL2 cDNA clones that we have analyzed. The first termination site was 690 bp 3′ of the termination codon, the second site was 740 bp, and the final transcription termination site was 900 bp 3′ of the termination codon. These mRNAs all had 3′-UTRs differing slightly in size but were detected by Northern analysis as a single mRNA species of 3.6 kb. A less abundant mRNA species of 4.9 kb that was detected in Northern blots of heart, liver, and pancreas RNA samples using LOXL2cDNA as a probe raises the possibility that an additional, but less frequently used, transcription termination signal may exist further 3′ of those we have already noted. Two overlapping PAC clones, PAC 17459 and PAC 17460, that were isolated using LOXL2-specific PCR primers, served as templates for sequencing the exon-intron boundaries, complete exons, and to determine intron sizes using PCR and extra long PCR reactions. Most exon-intron boundaries of theLOXL2 gene show the consensus sequence (C/T)AG-exon-GT(A/G). The sizes of the 11 exons of the LOXL2 gene ranged from 112 to 940 bp. Although the LOXL2 gene has 11 exons, five consecutive exons (exons 6–10), which encode the copper-binding and catalytic domains, revealed 84% sequence similarity, and exon sizes were very similar to the corresponding exons of the LOX andLOXL genes (18Kim Y. Boyd C.D. Csiszar K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7176-7182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Boyd C.D. Mariani T.J. Kim Y. Csiszar K. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All the other exons in theLOXL2 gene are divergent in both sequence and size. The sizes of the introns were the following from intron 1 to intron 10, respectively, with the exception of intron 6 that could not be amplified by these methods and is most probably larger in size: 2.0, 0.4, 0.53, 2.15, 2.7, 0.61, 1.22, 3.0, and 0.75 kb. The structure of the LOXL2 gene and the exact sizes of each exon and intron and a comparison with the sizes of the corresponding exons and introns of the LOX and LOXL genes are presented in Fig.1. An 830-bp region of the 5′-flanking sequence of the human LOXL2 gene that included the first exon and the first intron was analyzed using the DNA sequence analysis program GCG (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) and the TF sites data file to identify potential transcription factor binding sites. A large number of potential transcription factor binding sites were detected within the 5′-flanking region, the first exon and the first intron, including 10 AP-2 sites and two SP1 sites. The LOXL2gene promoter domain contains no typical TATA or CAAT box sequences. There is a single AP-1 site (TGAATCA) at position −522. There are four CAP/CRP-lac sites (ACACTTT) at positions −439 and −816, within the first exon at +130 and within the first intron (AAAGTGT). There is a single MRE site at −716 (TGCACAC), two malT sites (GGAGGA) at −400 and −55, a single GAGA site (AAGAGAG) at −716, one GR-uteroglobin (AGAACA) at −442, four GR-MT sites (TGTCCT) at −879, −560, −53, and one within the first exon at +113. A zeste-white (CACTCA) at position −499 and a JCV (GGGTGGGG) at −856 were also present within this promoter domain of the human LOXL2 gene. The DNA sequence of the promoter region of the LOXL2 gene and the major transcription factor binding site consensus sequences are shown in Fig.2. Transcription initiation sites of the LOXL2 gene were determined by primer extension analysis using total RNA from human placenta. The sizes of these fragments identified two transcription initiation sites at positions −95 and −100 and two additional but less abundant sites at −54 and −110. Recently, a lysyl oxidase-related cDNA was reported (25Saito H. Papaconstantinou J. Sato H. Goldstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8157-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This cDNA (WS9-14) contained a 3′ sequence homologous to sequences within ourLOXL2 cDNA. This region of homology started from bp 780 of the WS9-14 sequence and was identical to LOXL2cDNA sequence with the following differences: at bp 278 of theLOXL2 sequence there is an A, while at the corresponding position at bp 1131 of WS9-14 there is a T; at bp 433 a G in LOXL2 and an A in WS9-14; at 1350 an A inLOXL2 and a C in WS9-14; at 1631 a C inLOXL2 and a G in WS9-14; at 1715 an additional C in LOXL2; at 1779 a T in LOXL2 and a C inWS9-14. Several of these changes result in amino acid differences between LOXL2 and WS9-14. A number of additional sequence differences in the 3′-UTR were found between WS9-14 andLOXL2. The LOXL2 cDNA, however, has no sequence homology whatsoever to the most 5′ 780 bp ofWS9-14. The significance and origin of this 780-bp part of the WS9-14 sequence is unclear. Our analysis of theLOXL2 gene has confirmed that the cDNA sequence we have identified is encoded within 11 exons. The most 5′ of our cDNA is found at the 5′ end of exon 1 and primer extension, and promoter analysis has demonstrated that transcription initiation begins within this region. From these studies, it is clear that the most 5′ sequence of our LOXL2 cDNA is derived from the most 5′ exonic sequences of the LOXL2 gene. The most 5′ 780-bp sequences of the WS9-14 mRNA were generated by two independent PCR extension and 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends reactions, and the authors of this work (25Saito H. Papaconstantinou J. Sato H. Goldstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8157-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) had not confirmed these results by corresponding cDNA sequences. We were unable to isolate any cDNA or genomic clones that would contain identical or homologous sequences to this domain of WS9-14. Therefore the origin of the WS9-14 mRNA is unclear; it is possible that this 5′ part of the WS9-14 cDNA is a PCR product unrelated to the rest of the mRNA. It is certainly unlikely to be a transcript derived from the LOXL2 gene that we have mapped to chromosome 8p21.3 (29Jourdan-Le Saux C. Le Saux O. Donlon T. Boyd C.D. Csiszar K. Genomics. 1998; 51: 305-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of the LOXL2 mRNA detected a 3.6-kb band in all tissues with the exception of blood leukocytes. An additional, much less abundant mRNA of 4.9 kb was also detected in heart, liver, and pancreas. The steady state levels of the LOXL2 mRNA were quantitated in all tissues relative to β-actin mRNA. The expression of the LOXL2 mRNA was significantly higher in placenta, prostate, uterus, and pancreas (ratios between 2 and 3) compared with lower expression in brain, lung, skeletal muscle, thymus, and kidney (ratios below 0.5). The results of these experiments are presented in Fig. 3. As placenta showed the highest level of LOXL2 mRNA, we have further analyzed placental tissues and fetal membranes to identify the cells in these tissues that are responsible for the synthesis of the LOXL2mRNA. Placental villi and fetal membrane sections from 14 weeks of gestation and at term were used for in situ hybridizations using a LOXL2-specific 60-mer oligonucleotide probe. There was no hybridization signal detected with thisLOXL2-specific oligonucleotide probe with any of the cells in fetal membranes under these conditions. A weak signal was detected at 14 weeks gestation in the placental villi that was significantly increased in intensity in the villi of the term placenta (Fig.4). Positive autoradiographic signals were associated with the syncytiotrophoblasts, which are clearly responsible for the synthesis of this abundant LOXL2 mRNA in placental tissue. Based on the significant sequence homology and similarity in gene structure of the lysyl oxidases, it is likely that at least parts of the lysyl oxidase genes share a common ancestor. There is a closer evolutionary relationship between LOX and LOXLthan between these two lysyl oxidases and LOXL2. It is likely that at least parts of the LOX, LOXL, andLOXL2 genes share a common ancestor, as the exons encoding the functional domains of the mature protein have remained closely homologous both in sequence and in size. In contrast, exons encoding the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions and the amino-terminal domains of these proteins have diverged significantly, not only in sequence but also in gene structure. The LOXL2 mRNA was detected in almost all human tissues analyzed with highest expression in several reproductive tissues, such as placenta, prostate, and uterus. Although both LOX andLOXL genes are expressed in placenta, the LOXgene shows highest expression in heart and lung, while the highestLOXL mRNA levels were noted in heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney (18Kim Y. Boyd C.D. Csiszar K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7176-7182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The results of in situ hybridizations confirmed abundant LOXL2 mRNA levels in the placenta and have identified the syncytiotrophoblasts as responsible for this high expression of the LOXL2 gene. These findings support an earlier description of a protein that had been identified in the placenta with LOX activity but which was, however, different from LOX in its amino acid composition (30Kuivaniemi H. Savolainen E.R. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6996-7002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, while LOX has been shown to be present in the amnion, one of the components that makes up the fetal membranes (31Casey M.L. MacDonald P.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metabol. 1997; 82: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we did not detect any LOXL2 mRNA in the fetal membranes using these conditions for the in situ hybridization that readily detected its expression in the placenta. Clearly, therefore,LOX and LOXL2 are expressed in very different locations within reproductive tissues. The highest steady state level of LOX mRNA was reported at 12 weeks of gestation, both in amnion and placenta (31Casey M.L. MacDonald P.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metabol. 1997; 82: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 32Baccarati-Contri M. Vincenzi D. Quaglino D. Mori G. Pascuali-Ronchetti I. Matrix. 1989; 9: 428-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thereafter, levels of LOX mRNA and cross-linking activity declined dramatically to levels of only 5–10% by 42 weeks (31Casey M.L. MacDonald P.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metabol. 1997; 82: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have observed increasing levels ofLOXL2 mRNA between 14 and 40 weeks gestation in placenta, suggesting not only a different spatial but also a different temporal activity of the LOXL2 gene. There is an additional and quite significant difference between LOXL2 and all the other lysyl oxidases. Comparison of hydropathy profiles of LOX, LOXL, and LOXL2 revealed that the LOXL2 protein, strikingly, had no evidence for the hydrophobic signal sequence necessary for extracellular transport that has been noted in all the other lysyl oxidases. This result suggested that the LOXL2 protein may be processed and transported through an intracellular pathway that is different from the processing of the other members of the lysyl oxidase family (33Trackman P.C. Bedell-Hogan D. Tang J. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8666-8671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This prediction is supported by our immunohistochemical observations using a LOXL2-specific antibody that localized LOXL2 intra- as well as extracellularly. 2C. Jourdan-Le Saux, H. Tronecker, L. Bogic, G. D. Bryant-Greenwood, C. D. Boyd, and K. Csiszar, unpublished observation. In summary, we have identified LOXL2 as a new member of the lysyl oxidase gene family. Although its precise processing and localization are not known, based on the presence of the copper-binding and catalytic domains, it is very likely that this protein will have a catalytic function either extra- or intracellularly. A possible intracellular localization of LOXL2 coincides with recent reports of novel intracellular and intranuclear lysyl oxidases. However, it was not clear from these studies how the 32-kDa active and secreted form of lysyl oxidase could also have an intranuclear location (8Li W. Nellaiappan K. Strassmaier T. Graham L. Thomas K.M. Kagan H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12817-12822Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 9Wakasaki H. Ooshima A. Lab. Invest. 1990; 63: 377-384PubMed Google Scholar). A LOX-dependent alteration of chromatin structure has also been observed (34Mello M.L. Contente S. Vidal B.C. Planding W. Schenk U. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that LOX, or more likely an intracellular LOXL2, may directly or indirectly exert effects on nuclear components (5Smith-Mungo L.I. Kagan H.M. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 387-398Crossref Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 8Li W. Nellaiappan K. Strassmaier T. Graham L. Thomas K.M. Kagan H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12817-12822Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). An intracellular form of LOX was also found in association with fine, filamentous structure in the cytoplasm of fibroblasts, consistent with this form of LOX being a cytoskeletal protein (9Wakasaki H. Ooshima A. Lab. Invest. 1990; 63: 377-384PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the significant sequence homology and the intracellular localization of LOXL2, it is possible that this new protein is responsible for these reported intracellular and intranuclear catalytic functions and for at least some of the developmental and growth regulatory functions previously attributed to lysyl oxidase (LOX) (10Butler E. Handlin J. Benson S. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 173: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15DiDonato A. Lacal J.C. DiDuca M. Giampuzzi M. Ghighen G. Gusmano R.

In this report, we identify the cis-acting elements that control cardiac expression and α-adrenergic up-regulation of the exchanger gene. Deletion analysis revealed that a minimal cardiac promoter fragment from −184 to +172 is sufficient for cardiac expression and α-adrenergic stimulation. Mutational analysis revealed that both the CArG element at −80 and the GATA element at −50 were required for cardiac expression.

In addition, deletion analysis revealed one or more enhancer elements in the first intron (+103 to +134) that are essential for phenylephrine up-regulation but bear no homology to any known transcription element. Therefore, this work demonstrates that SRF and GATA-4 are critical for NCX1 expression in neonatal cardiomyocytes and that the −172 E-box in addition to a novel enhancer element(s) are required for phenylephrine up-regulation of NCX1 and may mediate its hypertrophic up-regulation.

The Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1) 1The abbreviations used are: NCX, sodium calcium exchanger; MEM, Eagle's minimum essential medium; SRF, serum response factor; bp, base pair(s); USF, upstream stimulatory factorcatalyzes the electrogenic exchange of one intracellular calcium ion for three extracellular sodium ions across the plasma membrane in many mammalian cells. Transport is reversible and can facilitate calcium entry, which in the heart is capable of triggering calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (1Kimura J. Noma A. Irisawa H. Nature. 1986; 319: 596-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The exchanger is most abundant in the heart, where it regulates Ca2+ fluxes across the sarcolemma and serves a critical role in the maintenance of the cellular calcium balance for excitation-contraction coupling. Na+-Ca2+ exchanger activity in cardiomyocytes is regulated by several factors. It is activated by cytosolic Ca2+ and MgATP (2Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1990; 344: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and inhibited by cytosolic sodium (3Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and ATP depletion (4Condrescu M. Gardner J.P. Chernaya G. Aceto J.F. Kroupis C. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9137-9146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A high affinity Ca2+-binding domain has been identified in the large cytoplasmic loop (residues 371–508) that is believed to be responsible for calcium regulation (5Levitsky D.O. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also inhibited by the exchanger inhibitory peptide, which corresponds to a 20-amino acid segment at the N terminus of the large cytoplasmic loop (6Li Z. Nicoll D.A. Collins A. Hilgemann D.W. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Weiss J.N. Tomich J.M. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1014-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study has demonstrated that the exchanger is phosphorylated via a protein kinase C-dependent pathway and that NCX1 phosphorylation appears to coincide with up-regulation of exchanger activity (7Iwamoto T. Pan Y. Wakabayashi S. Imagawa T. Yamanaka H.I. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13609-13615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition, the exchanger is regulated at the transcriptional level in cardiac hypertrophy, ischemia, and failure. In the feline model of acute right ventricular hypertrophy, NCX1 message levels are rapidly up-regulated following pressure overload (8Kent R.L. Rozich J.D. McCollam P.L. McDermott D.E. Thacker U.F. Menick D.R. McDermott P.J. Cooper G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1024-H1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Menick D.R. Barnes K.V. Thacker U.F. Dawson M.M. McDermott D.E. Rozich J.D. Kent R.L. Cooper G.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 779: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). An increase in NCX1 mRNA expression is also observed in cultured cardiac myocytes following α-adrenergic stimulation by phenylephrine or exposure to veratridine. Importantly, the exchanger is also up-regulated at both the message and protein levels in end-stage heart failure (10Studer R. Reinecke H. Bilger J. Eschenhagen T. Bohm M. Hasenfuss G. Just H. Holtz J. Drexler H. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the genetic elements and transcription factors that regulate NCX1 expression. Identification of the factors involved in NCX1 up-regulation is important to unraveling the sequence of molecular events that initiates hypertrophic growth. Furthermore, it may provide insight into the basis of the development of decompensated heart failure. The feline (11Barnes K.V. Cheng G. Dawson M.M. Menick D.R. J. Biol.

The NCX1 gene is unusual in that it contains three promoters and multiple 5′-untranslated region exons upstream of the coding region. As a result of alternative promoter usage and the resulting alternative splicing, there are multiple tissue-specific variants of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (11Barnes K.V. Cheng G. Dawson M.M. Menick D.R.

Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1250-C1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The feline cardiac minimal promoter (−184 to +172) is responsive to α-adrenergic stimulation and sufficient to drive expression of a reporter gene in neonatal cardiomyocytes but not mouse L cells (18Cheng G. Hagen T.P. Dawson M.L. Menick D.R. Circulation. 1998; 98: I609Google Scholar). Analysis of the DNA sequence of the feline cardiac basal NCX1 promoter revealed a number of elements that may be involved in regulation and are conserved in the rat promoter (14Nicholas S.B. Yang W. Lee S.L. Zhu H. Philipson K.D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H217-H232PubMed Google Scholar). There are two CANNTG motifs (E-boxes) at positions −172 and −153 that are potential target sites for the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors. E-box-binding proteins have been demonstrated to mediate the cardiac expression of several genes including the ventricular myosin light chain 2 (19Navankasattusas S. Sawadogo M. van Bilsen M. Dang C.V. Chien K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7331-7339Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), cardiac α-actin (20French B.A. Chow K.L. Olson E.N. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2439-2450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and α- and β-myosin heavy chain (21Molkentin J.D. Brogan R.S. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2602-2609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region also contains consensus sequence for two GATA boxes at positions −125 and −50. Several cardiac specific genes such as myosin light chain IA, myosin light chain IV, and β-myosin heavy chain (22Rindt H. Gulick J. Knotts S. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5332-5338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kurabayashi M. Komuro I. Shibasaki Y. Tsuchimochi H. Takaku F. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19271-19278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contain conserved GATA binding motifs. The GATA elements in the atrial natriuretic peptide (24Grepin C. Dagnino L. Robitaille L. Haberstroh L. Antakly T. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3115-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and α-myosin heavy chain (25Molkentin J.D. Kalvakolanu D.V. Markham B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) gene have been shown to be critical for cardiac expression. This region also contains a single MEF-2 element at position −166. A MEF-2-like motif appears to be required for cardiac-specific expression of the rat cardiac troponin T gene. There are six Nkx-2.5 binding sites in the first 1831 bases of the NCX promoter including one in the first 250 bases. The cardiogenic homeodomain factor Nkx-2.5 has been shown to be expressed in early cardiac cell progenitors and plays an important role in cardiac development. A single CArG element is present at position −80. A CArG element (CC(A/T)6GG) is also present in the 5′-flanking region of the cardiac α-actin, skeletal α-actin, β-actin, α-myosin heavy chain, cardiac myosin light chain 2, and troponin T genes (25Molkentin J.D.

The CArG elements of skeletal and cardiac α-actin are very homologous to the serum response element and serve as a binding site for the nuclear serum response factor (SRF). In the present study, we perform a detailed analysis of the NCX1 promoter elements important for neonatal cardiocyte expression and α-adrenergic induction. We present three main findings. First, expression of NCX1 in neonatal cardiomyocytes requires both the CArG element at −80 to −71 and the GATA element at −50 to −45. Second, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis revealed specific DNA-protein complexes for both of these elements. SRF is one of the factors binding to the CArG element, and GATA-4 binds to the GATA element. Third, mutagenesis and deletion analysis revealed a E-Box at position −172, and an additional enhancer element or elements in the first exon-intron boundary (+103 to +134), which are essential for α-adrenergic induction of the exchanger. This region bears no homology to any of the known transcription elements. All restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) or New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis and luciferase reporter kits were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM), Hanks' balanced salt solution, horse serum, and newborn calf serum were all from Life Technologies, Inc. Antibodies for supershift assays were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The AmpliCycle sequencing kit was obtained from Perkin-Elmer (Foster City, CA). All common reagents were of the highest quality and were purchased from either Fisher or Sigma. A 2-kb portion of the NCX promoter was cloned into the pGL2 vector as described previously (11Barnes K.V. Cheng G. Dawson M.M. Menick D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11510-11517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mutated constructs were generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides were designed to contain the desired mutation flanked on either side by 12 bp of wild-type NCX sequence. Then, these were used to introduce the mutations into the NCX1831 construct by polymerase chain reaction using the manufacturer's protocol. The entire promoter region of each mutant construct was sequenced using the AmpliCycle sequencing kit to ensure that they contained only the desired point mutations. Primary cardiocytes were obtained from 2–4-day-old neonatal rats and cultured by the method described previously (30Foster K.A. McDermott P.J. Robishaw J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: H432-H441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ventricular myocardium was isolated from neonatal rats, minced, and digested with enzyme solution (2.4 units/ml partially purified trypsin, 2.7 units/ml chymotrypsin, and 0.94 units/ml elastase in calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution). The tissue was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with stirring. After incubation, the cells were put into MEM plus 10% newborn calf serum and centrifuged at 250 × g. The pellets were resuspended in MEM plus 10% newborn calf serum. The incubation and centrifugation step was repeated five more times. Cardiac fibroblast were removed by preferential adherence to polystyene culture flasks for 90 min to obtain cultures with >95% cardiomyocyte purity (31Knowlton K.U. Baracchini E. Ross R.S. Harris A.N. Henderson S.A. Evans S.M. Glembotski C.C. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7759-7768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After enrichment, cardiocytes were plated in gelatin-coated 60-mm culture dishes at 1.25 × 106cells/plate in 4 ml of modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B), 10% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum, bromodeoxyuridine, and essential and nonessential amino acids. After serum incubation for 20–24 h, the cultures were washed and incubated in serum-free supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium including 10−7m recombinant insulin (Life Technologies, Inc.). One day after plating, the cardiocytes were placed in MEM containing 4% horse serum 1–4 h prior to transfection. The transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate DNA precipitation method described previously (32Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). The efficiency of transfection was between 1 and 2%. Briefly, 16 μg of Na+-Ca2+ exchanger-luciferase construct was co-transfected with 8 μg of cytomegalovirus promoter-driven β-galactosidase expression plasmid and kept in MEM. After 24 h of incubation, the medium was changed, and where designated, phenylephrine (100 μm) was added, and the cells were incubated in 10% CO2 for 48 h. Control cells were treated with 10 μm verapamil to inhibit any spontaneous contractile activity. Cells were washed twice in 3 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 15 min in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). The lysates were quick frozen and stored at −70 °C. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity assays were performed as described previously (11Barnes K.V. Cheng G. Dawson M.M. Menick D.R. J. Biol.

Guerin S.L. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 770-777PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 hearts from 1–4-day-old neonatal rats were rinsed 2 times in ice cold phosphate-buffered saline. 5 ml of NE1 buffer (250 mm sucrose, 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mmspermidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 mm KCl, and 2 mm MgCl2) was added to the tissue, which was immediately homogenized and filtered through two layers of cheese cloth. Nonidet P40 was added to the homogenate to a final concentration of 0.5%. Following five more strokes with a Dounce homogenizer, the homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were then washed with 5 ml of NE1 buffer and centrifuged as above. The pellet was resuspended in 1 packed cell volume of NE1 buffer containing 350 mm KCl followed by another 20 strokes with a homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to eliminate the large cell debris and then centrifuged at 180,000 × gfor 90 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed for 1 h to overnight at 4 °C against dialyzing buffer (50 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 20 mmK3PO4 (pH 7.4), 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol). After enriching for DNA-binding proteins on heparin-Sepharose CL-6B, the supernatant was stored at −80 °C. Nuclear extract (5 μg) was incubated in the presence of 50 μg/ml poly(dG-dC) in binding buffer (50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol). After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, the samples were loaded on 6% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed in 0.5× TBE at 10 V/cm of gel at 4 °C. The gels were dried and exposed to an x-ray film. For oligonucleotide competition or antibody supershift assays, nonradioactive oligonucleotides or antibodies were added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 10 min prior to the addition of the radioactive probe (for a complete listing of the oligonucleotide probes used in these studies, see Table I).Table IOligonucleotide probesProbeSequenceE-box 151 (−189), 43-mer5′-GATCGGCTGGAAGGATCTCTACATGTGTATTTTTATCGTCCAT-3′E-box 151 (−189), 43-merMutant GT AGATA 29 (−68), 44-mer5′-GATCGCGAAAGCCGAAAGGCACAGATAAGCAGAGATCCAGCTAT-3′GATA 29 (−68), 44-merMutant CTGCArG 55 (−93), 43-mer5′-GATCGTTGGGAACAGATCCATGTATGGAAGCGAAAGCCGAAAG-3′CArG, 22-mer5′-GATCAGATCCATGTATGGAAGC-3′CArG, 22-merMutant A C G TMEF2, 20-mer5′-GATCTCGTATTTTTATCGTC-3′Novel elementRegion +89 to +128, 44-mer5′-GATCAGCCCAGACTTGACGGAGGTAGGTGCAGGGCTTTTGTGAT-3′Region +89 to +128NCX189–128M(109–112) GAACRegion +103 to +117, 19-mer5′-GATCGGAGGTAGGTGCAGG-3′Oligonucleotide probes for EMSA contain a 4-bp (GATC) 5′-overhang for labeling purposes.

The raw data were analyzed by standard statistical analysis using StatView software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), and statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05 by the Dunnett one-tail test. In our initial characterization of the NCX1 cardiac promoter (11Barnes K.V. Cheng G. Dawson M.M. Menick D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11510-11517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that a construct containing the first 250 bp of the 5′-flanking region, the H1 exon, and 67 bp of the first intron is sufficient for cardiac-directed expression and α-adrenergic stimulation of the luciferase reporter gene. We have since shown that a construct containing only 184 bases of the 5′-flanking region has the same activity as the 250-bp construct (18Cheng G. Hagen T.P. Dawson M.L. Menick D.R. Circulation. 1998; 98: I609Google Scholar). This is also in agreement with what has been reported for the rat NCX1 minimal promoter (14Nicholas S.B. Yang W. Lee S.L. Zhu H. Philipson K.D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H217-H232PubMed Google Scholar). There are consensus sequences for a number of potential DNA-binding factors in the NCX1 cardiac minimal promoter (Fig.1). There are two potential binding sites for the GATA family of zinc-fingered transcription factors (A/T)GATA(A/G) and two CANNTG motifs (E-boxes) that are potential target sites for the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors. This region also contains a single MEF-2 element, a CArG element, and a binding site for the cardiogenic homeodomain factor Nkx-2.5. It is of interest to note that sequence of both GATA elements, the CArG element, MEF element, and the −153 E-box are perfectly conserved in both the feline and rat NCX1 promoters (14Nicholas S.B. Yang W. Lee S.L. Zhu H. Philipson K.D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H217-H232PubMed Google Scholar). Using the full-length (1831-bp) construct, we introduced site-specific point mutations into each of these elements, and the activity of each of the mutants was compared with the wild-type full-length construct to determine its contribution to cardiac specific expression (Fig.2). Each NCX1 mutant promoter construct was transfected in triplicate in at least three independent neonatal cardiomyocyte preparations. Point mutations within the −166 MEF-2 and −10 Nkx-2.5 elements resulted in reporter activity of 70–75% of the NCX1831 promoter-luciferase construct. If these elements play any role in the transcription of the NCX1 gene they do so to a very minor extent. Point mutations within the −172 E-box, −153 E-box, and −125 GATA elements reduced reporter activities to ∼35–55% of wild type promoter activity. Therefore, these elements appear to contribute to NCX1 transcription. Importantly, point mutations within either the −80 CArG element or the −50 GATA element resulted in luciferase activity of only 3–8% of the control levels. Clearly, the CArG element at −80 and the GATA element at −50 are critical to NCX1 expression in neonatal cardiocytes. To analyze the potential interactions of the NCX1 cardiac elements withtrans-acting factors, we conducted electrophoretic mobility shift assays with nuclear extracts from neonatal rat heart tissue. Oligonucleotide probes were generated for the 5′ E-box (−151 to −189), CArG (−93 to −55), and the 3′ GATA (−68 to −29) element (Table I). Mutation of the −172 E-box reduced reporter gene expression to 55% of control levels in transient transfection of neonatal cardiomyocytes; therefore, this E-box may play a minor role in NCX1 expression. Incubation of nuclear extracts from neonatal heart tissue with a 32P-labeled E-box oligonucleotide resulted in the formation of a specific protein-DNA complex (Fig. 3 A). Specificity was indicated by its competition with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled E-box oligonucleotide but not by a nonspecific GATA probe. This E-box element is directly adjacent to a MEF-2 element (Fig. 1), which is present as part of the sequence in the oligonucleotide probe used for the mobility shift assay. Transfection experiments indicate that the MEF-2 element does not appear to be important for NCX1 expression in neonatal cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2). Further, if this element plays a role in NCX1 expression, one would expect it to contribute to the complex of nuclear factors binding to the E-box oligonucleotide probe. Competition with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled MEF-2 element had no effect on the band. This demonstrates that the MEF-2 element does not play a role in the DNA-protein complex observed with the E-box element probe; therefore, it is unlikely to play a role in NCX1 expression in neonatal cardiomyocytes. An E-box element in the α-myosin heavy chain gene (34Ojamaa K. Samarel A.M. Klein I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31276-31281Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) has been demonstrated to be responsible for the up-regulation of the gene in response to increased contractile activity. Moreover, this E-box has been shown to bind a cardiomyocyte nuclear protein antigenically related to upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF-1) (34Ojamaa K. Samarel A.M. Klein I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31276-31281Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Gel supershifts were performed to determine if USF-1 is a part of the NCX1 −172 E-box binding complex. Incubation of the DNA-nuclear protein complex with 2 μg of USF-1 antibody did not result in a supershift (Fig. 3 B). In addition, the formation of this complex was not altered by incubation with antibodies against either of the widely expressed basic helix-loop-helix factors E12 or E47 (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, the NCX1 −172 E-box element-nuclear protein complex does not include detectable amounts of E12, E47 or USF-1. Incubation of nuclear extracts from neonatal rat hearts with the32P-labeled oligonucleotide for the NCX1 −80 CArG element resulted in the formation of two specific protein-DNA complexes (Fig.4). Competition with a 100-fold excess of the unlabeled 43-mer probe or a shorter 22-mer containing the NCX1 CArG sequence completely eliminated both of these complexes, whereas competition with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled mutant CArG sequence did not affect the binding of the probe to either of these complexes. In addition, incubation with nonspecific competitor DNA (100-fold E-box element) did not compete for binding to either complex. The ubiquitous SRF, which recognizes a CArG element in the cardiac α-actin promoter (35Chen C.Y. Croissant J. Majesky M. Topouzis S. McQuinn T. Frankovsky M.J. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Genet. 1996; 19: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), may be involved in the cardiac specific transcription of NCX1. To determine whether SRF actually binds to the NCX1 CArG element, a supershift assay was performed with anti-SRF polyclonal antibody. Incubation of the DNA-nuclear protein complex with 2 μg of SRF antibody showed a definitive supershift, demonstrating that at least one of the components is SRF or is antigenically related to SRF (Fig.4, lane 6). Incubation of nuclear extracts from neonatal cardiomyocytes with a32P-labeled GATA probe (−68 to −29), revealed a single protein-DNA complex (Fig. 5). Competition with 100-fold excess of unlabeled mutant GATA sequence or nonspecific competitor DNA (E-box (−172)) did not affect the complex; however, competition with a 100-fold molar excess of an unlabeled GATA probe completely eliminated the complex (Fig. 5 A). Both GATA-4 and GATA-6 are expressed in the adult heart. To determine if GATA-4 and/or GATA-6 was present in the NCX1 −50 GATA sequence-specific interaction, GATA-4 and GATA-6 antibodies were incubated with the nuclear protein-DNA complex and examined by gel shift analysis. The GATA-4 antibody clearly supershifted the −50 GATA complex (Fig.5 B). No supershift was detected with the GATA-6 antibody (data not shown), indicating that GATA-4 but not GATA-6 interacts with this site. In order to identify elements mediating α-adrenergic up-regulation, constructs containing mutations in the putative elements in the minimal promoter were transfected into neonatal rat cardiocytes treated with phenylephrine. Phenylephrine treatment induced an approximately 2-fold increase in luciferase activity over that of untreated (11Barnes K.V. Cheng G. Dawson M.M. Menick D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11510-11517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or verapamil-treated cardiomyocytes transfected with the 1831-bp full-length wild-type NCX1 luciferase construct (Fig.6). Fig. 6 demonstrates that mutations in the −10 Nkx, −166 MEF, −153 E-box, and −125 GATA elements did not affect α-adrenergic stimulation. Each shows a 1.8–2-fold induction of luciferase expression with PE treatment. Interestingly, constructs with point mutations in the −80 CArG and −50 GATA elements, which are required for transcriptional activity in the neonatal cardiocytes, have not lost α-adrenergic inducible expression. In fact, they are stimulated to a greater extent than the wild type NCX1 construct. This may be due in part to the very low transcription level of −50 GATA and −80 CArG (10–20-fold lower than wild type) mutant constructs. However, an NCX1 construct with the −172 E-box sequence mutated yielded only a 1.2-fold increase in luciferase activity when treated with phenylephrine (Fig. 6). This is significantly less induction than what is seen in the wild type NCX1 construct. Therefore, the NCX1 −172 E-Box element appears to be required for α-adrenergic up-regulation. This is similar to the α–MHC promoter in which an E-box element was demonstrated to be responsible for up-regulation in response to increased contractile activity (34Ojamaa K. Samarel A.M. Klein I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31276-31281Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Each of the above constructs contained the entire first exon (H1) and 67 bases of the first intron. Constructs in which luciferase was fused at position +22 of the H1 exon had only 20% of control activity. More importantly, these constructs did not show any up-regulation in response to phenylephrine treatment (data not shown). Therefore, in addition to the −172 E-box, one or more elements within the H1 exon or the first 67 bases of intron 1 appear to be required for α-adrenergic stimulation of the NCX1 gene. A series of deletions were made to identify the region responsible for α-adrenergic stimulation. Deletion of the last 13 bases of the first exon and the first 67 bases of intron sequence (Δ94–172) also resulted in a construct with low activity and insensitivity to PE stimulation, indicating that the elements responsible for α-adrenergic stimulation are located in this region (Fig. 7). Analysis of the first intron sequence revealed a single GATA element at +135. Since GATA-4 has been recently demonstrated to play an important role in the hypertrophic responsiveness of both β-MHC and angiotensin II1a receptor promoters (36Herzig T.C. Jobe S.M. Aoki H. Molkentin J.D. Cowley Jr., A.W. Izumo S. Markham B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7543-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 37Hasegawa K. Lee S.J. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. Kitsis R.N. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3943-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), mutations were introduced into the consensus +135 GATA element (Fig. 7). PE treatment stimulated reporter gene expression approximately 2-fold, indicating that the +134 GATA element was not required for α-adrenergic up-regulation. A deletion from +94 to +119 had low activity and was recalcitrant to PE stimulation, but the smaller deletion from +94 to +103 was still responsive to PE stimulation. In order to further define this element or elements, α-adrenergic up-regulation was examined with a construct containing seven point mutations between positions +106 and +112 (NCXM106–112). The mutation of this seven-base region was sufficient to lower luciferase activity and, more importantly, prevent α-adrenergic stimulation. In summary, this series of deletion and point mutation constructs have helped define a 33-bp region from +103 to +135 that includes the last two bases of the H1 exon and the first 27 bases of intron 1 (AG/GTAGGTGCAGGGCTTTTGTGATGAAAC). This region contains one or more elements that are requisite for α-adrenergic stimulation of NCX1 expression, and at least one of these is contained in part between +106 and +112. Sequence analysis revealed no consensus sequence for known transcriptional elements; therefore, α-adrenergic stimulation of Na+-Ca2+ exchanger expression is mediated via the −172 E-box and a novel element or elements present in the first intron. In order to further characterize this region and determine whether elements in this region bind nuclear factors, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using neonatal heart nuclear extracts with a double-stranded oligonucleotide probe corresponding to +89 through +128 containing the NCX1 cardiac novel element region (Fig. 8). Four protein-DNA complexes were observed binding to the cardiac novel element region probe. Competition experiments using a 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled competitor DNA sequences were used to determine specificity of the complexes. Incubation with cold cardiac novel element region probe competed away all but the band 4 protein-DNA complex. Competition with the mutant cardiac novel element region oligonucleotide, NCXM109–112, containing the four point mutations between positions +106 and +112 did not affect B1, B2, or B3 protein-DNA complexes, but the B4 complex was slightly diminished. Competition with the shorter (19-mer) oligonucleotide containing only +103–117 wild type sequence, eliminated the B1, B2, and B3 complexes but had less of an affect on B4. Therefore, the B1, B2, and B3 protein-DNA complexes appear to be specific for the 103–117 region. In addition, the 4-base point mutation further defines the element by demonstrating that a portion of it lies between positions +109 and +112. We have used promoter-reporter gene constructs to identify the elements regulating cardiac expression and mediating α-adrenergic up-regulation of the NCX1 gene. Here, we demonstrate that NCX1 expression in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes requires at least two DNA sequence elements, CArG and GATA. The CArG element (CCATGTATGG) present at −80 bp diverges from the canonical CArG sequence CC(AT)6GG but, nevertheless, is required for cardiac expression of the NCX1 gene. In addition, we have demonstrated that the SRF is a part of the complex binding to the NCX1 CArG element, suggesting that SRF is required for basal NCX1 expression. CArG boxes are present in the proximal promoters of many muscle genes and have been shown to be involved in skeletal as well as cardiac muscle-specific regulation (38Miwa T. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2803-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 39Amacher S.L. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 40Catala F. Wanner R. Barton P. Cohen A. Wright W. Buckingham M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4585-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although the NCX1 CArG element is required for basal activity, it does not appear to mediate α-adrenergic stimulated expression. This is similar to what has been identified in the human cardiac α-actin promoter and mouse skeletal α-actin promoter (41Sartorelli V. Webster K.A. Kedes L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1811-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Only recently has it been determined how the ubiquitous SRF factor, which mediates transcriptional activation of serum-responsive genes, could regulate muscle-specific genes. Interactions between SRF and other nuclear factors appear to provide mechanisms by which SRF could provide tissue-specific transcriptional activity. SAP-1, Elk-1, and Phox-1 have been demonstrated to potentiate the transcriptional activity of SRF on the c-fos promoter (42Grueneberg D.A. Simon K.J. Brennan K. Gilman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3318-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Chen and Schwartz (43Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6372-6384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the cardiogenic homeodomain factor, Nkx-2.5, interacts with SRF to synergistically trans-activate the cardiac α-actin promoter. This trans-activation is dependent on an intact serum response element and not on the Nkx-2.5 element. Interaction of SRF with Nkx-2.5 may also be important in the cardiac regulation of the NCX1 promoter. However, we showed earlier that the −10 Nkx-2.5 element does not appear to be required for NCX1 expression in neonatal rat cardiomyocyte (Fig. 2), and this element is not preserved in the rat NCX1 promoter (14Nicholas S.B. Yang W. Lee S.L. Zhu H. Philipson K.D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H217-H232PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction, if present in the NCX1 promoter, must be mediated via the CArG and not the Nkx-2.5 element, similar to what was found for the cardiac α-actin gene. Importantly, Nkx-2.5 and SRF have recently been shown to regulate the cardiac α-actin promoter through combinatorial interactions with GATA-4 (44Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Although these studies have not focused on transcription factor interactions, our experiments here demonstrate that, in addition to SRF, cardiac expression of NCX1 is also regulated by a GATA-4 factor. We are currently exploring the interactions of Nkx-2.5, SRF, and the GATA-4 factors in the co-activation of the NCX1 promoter. GATA elements have an important role in the transcriptional regulation of several cardiac specific genes including α-myosin heavy chain (25Molkentin J.D. Kalvakolanu D.V. Markham B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cardiac troponin C (45Ip H.S. Wilson D.B. Heikinheimo M. Tang Z. Ting C.N. Simon M.C. Leiden J.M. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1994; 14: 3115-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Although GATA elements do not play a role in the basal cardiac expression of the β-myosin heavy chain or angiotensin II type 1a receptor, a GATA binding site is requisite for the induction of these genes in in vivo hemodynamic pressure overload (36Herzig T.C. Jobe S.M. Aoki H. Molkentin J.D. Cowley Jr., A.W. Izumo S. Markham B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7543-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 37Hasegawa K. Lee S.J. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. Kitsis R.N. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3943-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). GATA-4 plays a critical role in the cardiac expression of NCX1 but is not required for α-adrenergic up-regulation. With the exception of the −172 E-box, none of the consensus sequences in the +184 minimal promoter appeared to mediate the α-adrenergic stimulation. A series of deletion constructs indicated that a 32-bp region spanning the first exon-intron boundary (+103 to +134) contains one or more additional elements requisite for α-adrenergic stimulated up-regulation. Interestingly, this region contains no consensus binding motifs for known transcription factors. Comparison of the rat (14Nicholas S.B. Yang W. Lee S.L. Zhu H. Philipson K.D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H217-H232PubMed Google Scholar), human (13Scheller T. Kraev A. Skinner S. Carafoli E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11510-11517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) gene sequence in this region revealed 100% homology between bases +104 to +114 and that 17 out of the 21 bases in the region from +94 to +114 are identical. Although the findings of this work by no means exclude the existence of other α-adrenergic responsive elements elsewhere in the NCX1 gene, they demonstrate clearly that the −172 E-Box and the region between +103 to +134 are both requisite for α-adrenergic stimulation in the context of the NCX1831 promoter-luciferase construct. α-adrenergic stimulation has been demonstrated to activate signaling pathways that result in cardiac hypertrophy. Although this study demonstrates that this region mediates α-adrenergic stimulation, it remains to be seen whether it also mediates up-regulation in response to hemodynamic load. It is important to note that these studies were carried out in neonatal cardiocytes. In vitro transfection of neonatal cardiocytes is an extremely valuable system to identify and begin to elucidate the role of specificcis-elements that mediate changes in expression. But the significance of the elements identified here and whether they mediate basal cardiac expression and/or hypertrophic induced up-regulation needs to be confirmed in adult cardiomyocytes in vivo. Transgenic lines with the NCX1 promoter should permit us to examine the relative importance and role of CArG, GATA, the E-box, and the novel element in mediating the expression of NCX1 during development and in the normal and hypertrophic heart.

Glucose enters cells through the activity of glucose transporters, a family of membrane-spanning proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 1Stephens J.M. Pilch P.F. Endocr.

GLUT4, the insulin-responsive glucose transporter, is present in adipose and muscle cells, the two tissues that respond to insulin stimulation with a large and rapid increase in glucose uptake. Insulin increases glucose uptake in these cells by stimulating the translocation of GLUT4 from a sequestered site in the intracellular microsomal compartment to the plasma membrane, where it can then transport glucose into the cell. Glucose uptake is the rate-limiting step for glucose metabolism, so the level of GLUT4 protein at the plasma membrane is the ultimate determinant of glucose utilization in adipose and muscle cells. Muscle and, to a lesser degree, adipose tissue are the primary sites of glucose disposal after a meal; therefore, alterations in GLUT4 expression affect the ability of the whole animal to metabolize a glucose load. This has been well demonstrated in transgenic mice, where overexpression of GLUT4 increases insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and overall glucose disposal (3Liu M.L. Gibbs E.M. McCoid S.C.

Even modest increases in GLUT4 expression have been shown to ameliorate insulin resistance in the db/db mouse (5Gibbs E.M. Stock J.L. McCoid S.C. Stukenbrok H.A. Pessin J.E. Stevenson R.W. Milici A.J. McNeish J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1512-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and to completely alleviate the insulin resistance that develops in mice fed a high fat diet (6Ikemoto S. Thompson K.S. Takahashi M. Itakura H. Lane M.D. Ezaki O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3096-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Decreased expression of GLUT4 has also been shown to affect insulin sensitivity, since targeted disruption of the GLUT4 gene in mice causes a decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (7Katz E.B. Stenbit A.E. Hatton K. DePinho R. Charron M.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) and mice that are heterozygous for the GLUT4 knockout develop a diabetic phenotype (8Stenbit A.E. Tsao T.S. Li J. Burcelin R. Greenen D.L. Factor S.M. Houseknecht K.L. Katz E.B. Charron M.J. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). GLUT4 expression in adipose tissue is invariably decreased in states of insulin resistance (9Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1644-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 10Kahn B.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1367-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This decrease in GLUT4 protein and mRNA levels is closely correlated with the decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into these tissues. No decrease in the expression of GLUT4 in muscle tissue has been observed in insulin-resistant states. However, a number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain how adipocyte metabolism could affect the insulin sensitivity of other tissues (11Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Free fatty acids (12Boden G. Diabetes. 1996; 46: 3-10Crossref Scopus (1421) Google Scholar) and tumor necrosis factor-α (13Hotamisligil G.S. Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are both factors that are secreted by adipocytes and can cause insulin resistance in other tissues. Thus, changes in lipid metabolism or changes that alter tumor necrosis factor-α production in the adipocyte may underlie the ability of alterations in adipocyte metabolism to affect insulin sensitivity of other tissues. Whatever the mechanism, evidence for the ability of GLUT4 expression levels in the adipocyte to affect whole body glucose disposal comes from studies with transgenic mice; if GLUT4 is specifically overexpressed only in adipose tissue, there is an increase in the insulin sensitivity of the whole animal with an increase in whole body glucose disposal and decreased basal insulin levels (14Shepherd P.R. Gnudi L. Tozzo E. Yang H. Leach F. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22243-22246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3T3-L1 adipocyte is a reliable in vitro model of tissue adipocytes. Just as in adipose tissue, insulin acutely increases GLUT4 activity at the plasma membrane in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. However, prolonged treatment with insulin represses GLUT4 gene expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (15Flores-Riveros J.R. McLenithan J.C. Ezaki O. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), with a rapid decrease occurring in the rate of GLUT4 transcription. Because circulating insulin levels are increased in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, the repression of adipocyte GLUT4 expression by insulin may play a role in the insulin resistance of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Using promoter-reporter gene constructs, we previously identified a cis-acting element in the GLUT4 gene that mediates the repression of GLUT4 by insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (16Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6210-6217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A potential insulin response element was identified between bases −706 and −676 in the 5′-flanking region by DNase I footprint analysis. A reporter gene construct in which bases −706 to −676 were deleted was not repressed by insulin treatment, confirming that this sequence is necessary for the repression of the GLUT4 promoter by insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. This sequence does not show homology to previously described insulin response elements and thus represents a distinct mechanism of gene regulation by insulin. In this report, we identify nuclear proteins that bind to this insulin response element (IRE) 1The abbreviations used are: IRE, insulin response element; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); CTF, CCAAT-binding transcription factor; NF1, nuclear factor I1The abbreviations used are: IRE, insulin response element; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); CTF, CCAAT-binding transcription factor; NF1, nuclear factor Ias members of the nuclear factor I (NF1) family of transcription factors. 3T3-L1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum and induced to differentiate into adipocytes by treating confluent cells with 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 μmdexamethasone, and 167 nm insulin in 10% fetal bovine serum for 2 days, followed by treatment with 167 nm insulin in 10% fetal bovine serum for 2 days. The cells were then maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and fed every other day. 8 days after induction of differentiation, a medium change was made, and cells were studied on day 9. The −785-GLUT4/CAT plasmid (wild type) contained 785 bp of the 5′-flanking region of the murine GLUT4 gene, the GLUT4 transcription initiation site, 171 bp of GLUT4 5′-untranslated sequence, and the coding sequence for the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene (16Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6210-6217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Mutations in the GLUT4 IRE were produced by digesting the −785-GLUT4/CAT plasmid withHindIII and SmaI to remove bases −785 to −469 of the GLUT4 promoter. This sequence was then replaced with an insert generated by the polymerase chain reaction using Taqand Pwo DNA polymerase (Expand; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to amplify the insert in a two-step technique as described by Chen and Przybyla (17Chen B. Przybyla A.E. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 657-659PubMed Google Scholar). In the first reaction, the following oligonucleotides containing the desired mutations were used as 5′ primers: M1, 5′-CACCTGTCCCTTAAGTCCCCTCCAAGAACCAGTGTAG-3′; M2, 5′-CACCTGTCCCTTGGGTCCCCTTTAAGAACCAGTGTAG-3′; M3, 5′-CACCTGTCCCTTGGGTCTTCTCCAAGAACCAGTGTAG-3′. These primers, except for the underlined base changes, were complementary to bases −673 to −710 in the 5′-flanking region of the GLUT4 gene. 5′-AGCTTGCGAAATTTCTGAAAGAATTG-3′, complementary to bases −248 to −269 in the 5′-flanking region of the GLUT4 gene (excluding the underlined bases), was used as the 3′ primer. The −785-GLUT4/CAT plasmid was used as the template. The product from the first amplification reaction was purified from an agarose gel using Qiaquick (Qiagen) and was used as the 3′ primer in the second reaction. The M13 reverse primer (5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3′) was used as the 5′ primer, and −785-GLUT4/CAT was again used as the template. This product was digested with HindIII and SmaI. The 316-bp fragment was purified from an agarose gel using Qiaquick (Qiagen) and was inserted into theHindIII/SmaI-digested −785-GLUT4/CAT plasmid. The plasmids were sequenced to confirm the ligated ends, the generation of the mutation, and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified sequence. Transfection was performed using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (18Graham F.L. Van Der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6464) Google Scholar). Subconfluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transfected with 25 μg of the reporter construct and 2.5 μg of the pSV2Neo plasmid. The cells were incubated with the calcium phosphate-DNA precipitate for 4 h and then shocked with 10% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 min. Cells were selected and maintained in 300 μg/ml G418 beginning 24 h after transfection. After 7 days, resistant foci of clones were pooled and maintained for further study. Two or more independent pools of 20–50 foci were studied for each construct. Cells were lysed in 5m guanidinium isothiocyanate, 0.5% sarcosyl, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and total RNA was isolated by centrifugation over a 5.7 m CsCl cushion. For quantitation of the endogenous GLUT4 message, 10 μg of total RNA was separated by electrophoresis through a 1.2% agarose gel containing 6.5% formaldehyde. The RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), fixed by UV irradiation, and hybridized with a 1.7-kilobase pair murine GLUT4 cDNA (2 × 106 cpm/ml) that was labeled by random hexamer priming (Decaprime; Ambion, Inc.). Hybridization was performed in a solution containing 50% formamide, 4× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 0.5 mg/ml sodium pyrophosphate, and 1% SDS at 42 °C for 16 h. The filter was washed at high stringency (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C) for 1 h. Band intensity of the 2.7-kilobase pair GLUT4 mRNA was quantitated on a Fuji BAS2000 bioimaging autoanalyzer. To quantitate the reporter mRNA levels, a quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR assay was used as described previously (16Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6210-6217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), except that the cellular RNA was not digested with DNase I prior to the reverse transcriptase PCR. Instead, a control was performed to document that any DNA contamination of the cellular RNA was quantitatively insignificant compared with the reporter mRNA. To determine this, a known quantity of competitor cRNA was reverse transcribed. The reverse transcriptase was then heat-inactivated before adding an aliquot of the RNA sample, followed by amplification by PCR using the same conditions as for the competitive reverse transcriptase PCR. Nuclear extract was prepared from day 9 3T3-L1 adipocytes following the method described by Lavery and Schibler (19Lavery D.J. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1995; 7: 1871-1884Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Except when noted, the following were added to each of the solutions during purification as inhibitors of protein phosphatase activity: 30 mm β-glycerophosphate (Sigma), 1 mg/mlp-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma), and 5 mm sodium vanadate (Fisher). The protein concentration of the nuclear extract was quantitated using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). A 41-bp double-stranded GLUT4 IRE oligonucleotide probe (probe A), corresponding to bases −710 to −674 of the 5′-flanking region of the GLUT4 gene plus GATC on the 3′-end for labeling, was synthesized and labeled with [α-32P]dATP by a fill-in reaction (Megaprime; Ambion). Mutated GLUT4 IRE probes (probes M1, M2, and M3) were also synthesized. These probes were identical to the wild-type GLUT4 IRE probe (probe A) except for two base changes introduced as indicated by the boldface capital letters in Table I. 50–100 × 103 cpm of labeled probe was incubated with 3 μg of nuclear extract in a 30-μl solution containing 0.33× NUN buffer (1× NUN: 0.3 m NaCl, 1 m urea, 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), and 1 mm dithiothreitol), 8.3% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 2 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). The binding reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then separated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). For competition reactions, 100 ng of unlabeled oligonucleotide (approximately 100-fold excess over the labeled probe) was added to the binding reaction. The −710 to −674 GLUT4 double-stranded oligonucleotide (probe A) was used as a specific competitor, and a 24-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide including the unrelated DNA binding sequence corresponding to bases −437 to −421 of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase 2 5′-flanking region was used as a nonspecific competitor (competitor S). A 27-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the NF1 binding site from adenovirus 2 (N in Table I) was also used as a competitor. For the “supershift” assays, 4 μl of an anti-CCAAT-binding transcription factor (CTF)/NF1 antibody raised against recombinant CTF-2 (generously provided by N. Tanese, New York University) or 4 μl of nonimmune rabbit serum was added to the binding reaction. Autoradiography was performed at −80 °C with Kodak X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) and an intensifying screen for the indicated times.Table INucleotide sequence of the wild type and mutated GLUT4 insulin response element probesProbeSequenceGLUT4 IREcacctgtcccttgggtcccctccaagaaccagtgtaggatcM1cacctgtcccttTTgtcccctccaagaaccagtgtaggatcM2cacctgtcccttgggtcccctAAaagaaccagtgtaggatcM3cacctgtcccttgggtccAAtccaagaaccagtgtaggatcNttttggattgaagccaatatgataaaaNF1 consensusTGG CCAAlso shown are the adenovirus 2 NF1 binding sequence probe (N) and the consensus binding sequence for NF1 proteins.

The samples were loaded on a denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel, using a 12.5% stacking gel and a 7% resolving gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon; Millipore Corp.). The filter was blocked in 5% nonfat milk in 0.05% Tween 20, 25 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl (TTBS) and then incubated with antibody in 1% nonfat milk in TTBS. The filter was washed with TTBS and then probed with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma), washed with TTBS, and then developed using an enhanced chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Primary antibodies used include the anti-CTF/NF1 antibody (generously provided by N. Tanese), and an anti-NF1 antibody raised against the common N terminus of the NF1 isoforms (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Nuclear extract from 3T3-L1 adipocytes was prepared using the method of Lavery and Schibler (19Lavery D.J. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1995; 7: 1871-1884Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar) as described above, except that the inhibitors of protein phosphatase activity were not included. 15 μg of nuclear extract was treated with alkaline phosphatase (from calf intestine, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 1× phosphatase buffer, 0.3× NUN buffer, and 2 units of alkaline phosphatase at 37 °C for 3 h. In some samples, 1% SDS was added to the reaction mixture, as noted. Inactive alkaline phosphatase (Δ) was prepared by incubating in 25 mm EDTA at 70 °C for 4 h. Control nuclear extract was incubated in the reaction buffer at 37 °C with no enzyme added. Our earlier experiments identified the nucleotide sequence from bases −676 to −706 in the 5′-flanking region of the GLUT4 gene as necessary for repression of the GLUT4 promoter by insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (16Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6210-6217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Examination of this sequence revealed the presence of the consensus binding site sequence for the NF1 family of transcription factors, TGGN7CCA at bases −687 to −699. In order to determine if the nuclear factors that bind to this region are related to the NF1 family, a series of mutations were made to specifically disrupt the NF1 consensus sequence (Table I). A gel mobility shift assay was performed using these mutated oligonucleotides in direct binding experiments and as competitors of the wild-type GLUT4 IRE oligonucleotide (probe A). When incubated with 3T3-L1 adipocyte nuclear extract, the wild-type GLUT4 IRE produced two major protein-DNA complexes, bands 1 and 2 (Fig.1 A, lanes 3, 10, and 18). Closer inspection of the gels, particularly when the gels were run for a longer time (Fig.1 B, lane 1), revealed that band 1 is actually composed of two protein-DNA complexes, forming bands 1a and 1b. (In some experiments, an additional protein-DNA complex migrating between bands 1a and 1b is also seen). As seen in Fig. 1, 3T3-L1 nuclear proteins have altered affinities for mutants 1 and 2, which have base changes that disrupt the 5′- or 3′-half of the consensus NF1 binding sequence. None of the proteins that form the major protein-DNA complexes identified by the wild-type sequence bind to mutant 1 (Fig.1 A, lane 11, and Fig. 1 B,lane 7), and mutant 1 does not compete with the wild-type sequence for the binding of any of these proteins (Fig.1 A, lane 7, and Fig. 1 B,lane 4). The protein that forms the fastest migrating complex (band 2) does not bind to mutant 2 (Fig.1 A, lane 12, and Fig. 1 B,lane 9), and mutant 2 does not compete with the wild-type sequence for the binding to this protein (Fig. 1 A,lane 8, and Fig. 1 B, lane 5). A protein that produces a protein-DNA complex that has a similar migration to the slower migrating complex identified by the wild-type sequence does bind to mutant 2. 3T3-L1 adipocyte nuclear protein(s) binds to mutant 2 and forms a protein-DNA complex with a mobility at position 1a but does not form a complex with a mobility at position 1b (Fig. 1 A, lane 12, and Fig. 1 B, lane 9). Similarly, mutant 2 competes with the wild-type sequence for the proteins that form band 1a but does not compete for binding to the proteins that form band 1b (Fig. 1 A, lane 8, and Fig.1 B, lane 5). Mutant 3 has a two-base substitution in the middle of the NF1 consensus binding sequence that should not affect binding of NF1 transcription factors. 3T3-L1 adipocyte nuclear proteins bind to mutant 3 and form the same protein-DNA complexes as the wild-type sequence (Fig. 1 A,lane 13, and Fig. 1 B, lane 11), and mutant 3 can compete with the wild-type sequence for binding to all of the proteins that bind to it (Fig. 1 A,lane 9, and Fig. 1 B, lane 6). Finally, an oligonucleotide that contains the adenovirus 2 NF1 binding site (N) was used as a competing oligonucleotide. The NF1 oligonucleotide competes with the wild-type GLUT4 IRE for binding to the 3T3-L1 adipocyte nuclear proteins that form bands 1b and 2 but does not compete with the wild-type sequence for binding to the protein(s) that forms band 1a (Fig. 1 A,lanes 6 and 14, and Fig.1 B, lane 3) Taken together, these results indicate that the 3T3-L1 adipocyte nuclear proteins that bind to the GLUT4 IRE include proteins that have similar binding characteristics as NF1 family members, forming bands 1b and 2. In addition, there are proteins that bind to this region that have binding properties different from NF1 family members, forming band 1a. Antibody raised against recombinant CTF/NF1 (generously provided by N. Tanese) was used in the gel mobility shift assay to determine whether the proteins in the 3T3-L1 adipocyte nuclear extract that bind to the GLUT4 IRE contain NF1. As shown in Fig.1 A (lanes 1 and 2) and Fig.1 C, antibody to CTF/NF1 (N), but not preimmune serum (C), disrupts formation of complexes 1b and 2, and produces a “super-shifted” band when the 3T3-L1 nuclear proteins are bound to the GLUT4 IRE. The anti-NF1 antibody does not disrupt band 1a. These results confirm those of the mutational analysis,i.e. that bands 1b and 2 contain proteins in the NF1 family and that band 1a does not contain an NF1 protein. To confirm which protein classes bind to the mutated GLUT4 insulin response elements, the NF1 oligonucleotide was used to compete for binding of 3T3-L1 adipocyte nuclear proteins to the M1, M2, and M3 oligonucleotides in the gel mobility shift assay. The mutant 1 bound neither the NF1 nor the non-NF1 proteins (Fig. 1 A,lanes 11 and 15, and Fig.1 B, lanes 7 and 8). The protein-DNA complex formed with mutant 2 (Fig. 1 A,lane 12, and Fig. 1 B, lane 9) was not competed away by the NF1 oligonucleotide (Fig.1 A, lane 16, and Fig. 1 B,lane 10), confirming that this mutant does not bind NF1 proteins. Some of the protein-DNA complexes formed with the mutant 3 probe (Fig. 1 A, lane 13, and Fig. 1 B, lane 11) are competed away by the NF1 oligonucleotide, but the complex forming band 1a remains (Fig.1 A, lane 17, and Fig. 1 B,lane 12). Table IIsummarizes the classes of proteins that bind to the wild type and mutated GLUT4 insulin response elements based on the results of these gel mobility shift assays.Table II3T3-L1 adipocyte nuclear proteins bound to wild type and mutated GLUT4 insulin response element sequencesIREProteins boundNF1Non-NF1Wild type++M1−−M2−+M3++ Open table in a new tab GLUT4 promoter/CAT reporter constructs were produced that contained mutations 1, 2, and 3 in the context of 785 base pairs of 5′-flanking sequence. The wild type and mutant constructs were stably transfected into 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. After the cells were differentiated into adipocytes, the responses of the reporter genes were assessed when the cells were treated with 1 μm insulin for 8 h. Insulin repressed endogenous GLUT4 expression by 44–54% in all of the stable cell lines expressing the reporter constructs, similar to the suppression observed in untransfected 3T3-L1 adipocytes. As shown in Fig.2, expression of the wild type −785-GLUT4/CAT reporter construct was repressed by insulin to a similar degree as the endogenous GLUT4 gene, as was seen previously (16Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6210-6217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Expression of the reporter construct containing the M3 mutation, which does not disrupt any of the protein-DNA interactions detected in the gel mobility shift assay, was also repressed by insulin to a similar degree as both the endogenous GLUT4 gene and the wild type reporter construct. In contrast, expression of the reporter construct that contains the M1 mutation, which disrupts all of the major protein-DNA interactions detected in the gel mobility shift assay, showed no repression by insulin treatment. Finally, expression of the reporter construct containing the M2 mutation, which disrupts NF1 protein binding but does not disrupt binding of the non-NF1 nuclear protein(s), showed partial repression by insulin treatment. However, this repression is significantly less than that of the wild type (p < 0.005) or M3 mutant (p < 0.05) constructs. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with 1 μm insulin for 0, 10, 20, or 60 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared from these cells and studied by gel mobility shift assay using the GLUT4 IRE as the probe. The gels were run for a longer period of time to allow for better separation of the bands. While this prolonged electrophoresis resulted in loss of sharpness of the bands, it revealed that insulin treatment of the cells caused a decreased mobility of certain of the protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 3). While this change in mobility is subtle, it is reproducible, having been observed in numerous experiments using four preparations of nuclear extract. This mobility change was seen in nuclear extract prepared from cells treated with insulin for 10 min. However, by 20 min the mobility change began to diminish, and by 60 min the mobility of the protein-DNA complexes reverted to that of cells not treated with insulin. The bands whose mobility was shifted by insulin treatment correspond to bands 1b and 2, i.e. the bands that contain the NF1 proteins (see above). Note that the exposure for Fig. 3 was chosen to best discern band 1b; the mobility shift of band 2 is better seen with other exposures (not shown). The identity of the shifted bands as containing NF1 proteins was verified by examining the mobility of the non-NF1 proteins that bind to the GLUT4 IRE. Fig.4 shows the results of a gel mobility shift assay with nuclear extracts incubated with the radiolabeled GLUT4 IRE probe (probe A) in the presence of an excess of an unlabeled NF1 consensus binding site oligonucleotide to compete away binding of NF1 proteins. There is no difference in the mobility of the remaining non-NF1-containing complex (band 1a) that is formed from nuclear extract from 3T3-L1 adipocytes that were treated with insulin for 0, 10, 20, or 60 min. In addition, incubating the 3T3-L1 nuclear extract with CTF/NF1 antibody in the gel mobility shift binding reaction confirmed that the protein-DNA complexes that had altered mobility when prepared from insulin-treated cells contained NF1 proteins. 2D. W. Cooke and M. D. Lane, unpublished data. Since 1 μm is a supraphysiologic insulin concentration, the effect of more physiologic concentrations of insulin on the gel mobility shift pattern was examined. Nuclear extract was prepared from 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with increasing concentrations of insulin for 10 min. As shown in Fig. 5, insulin at a concentration as low as 10 nm altered the mobility of the protein complexes that bind to the GLUT4 IRE, and treatment with 25 nm insulin induced a maximal shift in mobility. The change in mobility of the NF1-containing protein-DNA complexes induced by insulin observed in the gel mobility shift assay could be due to various causes, including 1) insulin treatment causing new proteins to bind to the DNA probe, either in addition to or in place of the proteins bound in untreated cells, or 2) insulin treatment inducing a covalent modification of the proteins that bind to the DNA probe. To determine whether insulin induces a covalent modification of the NF1 proteins in 3T3-L1 cells, Western immunoblot analysis was performed on nuclear proteins isolated from control and insulin-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 6 A, anti-CTF/NF1 antibody detects three protein isoforms in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. When the adipocytes are treated with insulin, there is a rapid disappearance of the fastest migrating protein band. This band disappears in nuclear extract from adipocytes treated with insulin for 10 min and reappears in the nuclear extract from cells treated with insulin for 60 min. When 3T3-L1 adipocytes are treated with increasing concentrations of insulin for 10 min, the fastest migrating protein band begins to disappear with 10 nm insulin treatment and completely disappears with 25 n"
https://openalex.org/W2031697457,"Sequence-specific pyrrole-imidazole polyamides can be designed to interfere with transcription factor binding and to regulate gene expression, both <i>in vitro</i> and in living cells. Polyamides bound adjacent to the recognition sites for TBP, Ets-1, and LEF-1 in the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), long terminal repeat inhibited transcription in cell-free assays and viral replication in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. The DNA binding activity of the transcription factor Ets-1 is specifically inhibited by a polyamide bound in the minor groove. Ets-1 is a member of the winged-helix-turn-helix family of transcription factors and binds DNA through a recognition helix bound in the major groove with additional phosphate contacts on either side of this major groove interaction. The inhibitory polyamide possibly interferes with phosphate contacts made by Ets-1, by occupying the adjacent minor groove. Full-length Ets-1 binds the HIV-1 enhancer through cooperative interactions with the p50 subunit of NF-κB, and the Ets-inhibitory polyamide also blocks formation of ternary Ets-1·NF-κB·DNA complexes on the HIV-1 enhancer. A polyamide bound adjacent to the recognition site for NF-κB also inhibits NF-κB binding and ternary complex formation. These results broaden the application range of minor groove-binding polyamides and demonstrate that these DNA ligands are powerful inhibitors of DNA-binding proteins that predominantly use major groove contacts and of cooperative protein-DNA ternary complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1981216393,"Activation of blood platelets by physiological stimuli (e.g. thrombin, ADP) at sites of vascular injury induces inside-out signaling, resulting in a conformational change of the prototype integrin αIIbβ3 from an inactive to an active state competent to bind soluble fibrinogen. Furthermore, ligand occupancy of αIIbβ3initiates outside-in signaling and additional conformational changes of the receptor, leading to the exposure of extracellular neoepitopes termed ligand-induced binding sites (LIBS), which are recognized by anti-LIBS monoclonal antibodies. To date, the mechanism of bidirectional transmembrane signaling of αIIbβ3 has not been established. In this study, using our newly developed anti-LIBScyt1 monoclonal antibody, we showed that extracellular ligand binding to αIIbβ3 on blood platelets induces a transmembrane conformational change in αIIbβ3, thereby exposing the LIBScyt1 epitope in the αIIb cytoplasmic sequence between Lys994 and Asp1003. In addition, a point mutation at this site (P998A/P999A) renders αIIbβ3 constitutively active to bind extracellular ligands, resulting in fibrinogen-dependent cell-cell aggregation. Taken collectively, these results demonstrated that the extracellular ligand-binding site and a cytoplasmic LIBS epitope in integrin αIIbβ3 are conformationally and functionally coupled. Such bidirectional modulation of αIIbβ3 conformation across the cell membrane may play a key role in inside-out and outside-in signaling via this integrin. Activation of blood platelets by physiological stimuli (e.g. thrombin, ADP) at sites of vascular injury induces inside-out signaling, resulting in a conformational change of the prototype integrin αIIbβ3 from an inactive to an active state competent to bind soluble fibrinogen. Furthermore, ligand occupancy of αIIbβ3initiates outside-in signaling and additional conformational changes of the receptor, leading to the exposure of extracellular neoepitopes termed ligand-induced binding sites (LIBS), which are recognized by anti-LIBS monoclonal antibodies.

By using these purified proteins in in vitro cleavage assays with structural and non-structural viral polyprotein substrates, we found that 3CD processes the poliovirus structural polyprotein precursor (P1) 100 to 1000 times more efficiently than 3C processes P1. We also found that trans-cleavage of other 3CD molecules and sites within the non-structural P3 precursor is more efficiently mediated by 3CD than 3C. However, 3C and 3CD appear to be equally efficient in the processing of a non-structural polyprotein precursor, 2C3AB. Four mutated 3CD polyproteins with site-directed lesions in the 3D domain of the proteinase were analyzed for their ability to process viral polyprotein precursors and to form a ternary complex with RNA sequences encoded in the 5′ terminus of the viral genome. Analysis of mutated 3CD polypeptides revealed that specific mutations within the 3D amino acid sequences of 3CD confer differential effects on 3CD activity. All four mutated 3CD proteins tested were able to process the P1 structural precursor with wild type or near wild type efficiency. However, three of the mutated enzymes demonstrated an impaired ability to process some sites within the P3 non-structural precursor, relative to wild type 3CD.

The positive strand RNA genome of poliovirus contains a single open reading frame that codes for a 247-kDa viral polyprotein. Proper expression of poliovirus gene products requires specific protein processing of the viral polyprotein by the enzymatic activities of virally encoded proteinases. These enzymes cleave the polyprotein co- and post-translationally into the structural and non-structural viral gene products (Fig. 1). The majority of cleavage events within the viral polyprotein occur at Q–G bonds and is mediated by a proteinase function associated with the viral-encoded 3C protein (1Larsen G.R. Anderson C.W.

Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 161: 49-87PubMed Google Scholar). This regulation of gene expression is essential for viral replication since polyprotein precursors have functions in replication that are distinct from those of the mature cleavage products (8Richards O.C. Ehrenfeld E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 161: 89-119PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wimmer E. Hellen C.U.T. Cao X. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 353-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). An example of a molecule exhibiting these differential functions is the viral polyprotein 3CD, which is an active proteinase containing the entire amino acid sequences of the 3C proteinase and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, 3D. Polypeptide 3CD is a multi-functional protein required for both proteolytic processing of the capsid precursor protein and, although it has no detectable elongation activity in vitro, viral RNA replication. The role of 3CD in viral RNA replication is dependent on its ability to form a ternary ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with the 5′-terminal sequences of genomic RNA (the 5′ cloverleaf structure) and a cellular RNA-binding protein termed poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) (10Andino R.

Previous biochemical studies on poliovirus 3C and 3CD enzymes and structural studies on poliovirus 3C have suggested that, whereas the proteinase active site and RNA binding domains reside in 3C, processing of the viral capsid precursor (P1) and RNP complex formation with the 5′-terminal RNA sequences are more efficiently mediated by 3CD than 3C (10Andino R.

These findings have led to the hypothesis that structural domains within the 3D portion of the 3CD polyprotein contribute to the enhanced 3C activities. Although the exact biochemical roles of specific 3D amino acid sequences and domains within 3CDpronecessary for proteinase and RNA binding activities are poorly understood, the 3D domain is necessary for the complete processing of the poliovirus capsid precursor polyprotein P1, as has been demonstrated using both in vitro synthesized 3CD enzymes (13Ypma-Wong M.F.

In these previous studies, neither purified 3C nor carboxyl-terminal truncations of 3CD expressed in vitro were able to efficiently mediate processing of the P1 precursor. Studies detailing the precise function of specific residues or structural motifs in 3D necessary for mediating 3CD processing of the P1 precursor have been limited. An early report described a four-amino acid insertion in the 3D domain of the poliovirus polyprotein that eliminated cleavage of the P1 precursor while still retaining 3C-mediated processing of the non-structural polypeptides (12Ypma-Wong M.F. Dewalt P.G. Johnson V.H. Lamb J.G. Semler B.L. Virology. 1988; 166: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Two reports describing the effects of specific mutations in poliovirus 3D on RNA polymerase activity and P1 proteolytic processing found that whereas mutations in 3D had effects on both processing and RNA replication, no single mutation in 3D sequences affected processing without also affecting RNA replication (18Burns C.C.

In this study, we have expressed and purified recombinant poliovirus 3C and 3CD proteins. We have used these proteins in a comparative biochemical analysis of their proteolytic processing activities on viral polyprotein substrates and their RNA binding properties in the presence of 5′ noncoding region sequences of poliovirus RNA and purified recombinant PCBP2 protein. In order to determine the contribution of specific amino acid residues in 3D on 3CD functions, this analysis was extended to a number of recombinant 3CD polyproteins containing site-specific mutations in 3D previously shown to have deleterious effects on viral RNA replication (19Diamond S.E.

Virology. 1992; 189: 568-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). pT7-PV1-P1(stop) was constructed by placing sequences coding for tandem stop codons (in bold, below) at the 3′ terminus of the P1 coding region in pT7-PV1 using oligonucleotide mismatch mutagenesis (21Kunkel T.A.

Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 279-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) with the Stratagene QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and oligonucleotides as follows: P1stop + (5′-CCACATATTGATAAGGACACC-3′) and P1stop − (5-GGTGTCCTTATCAATATGTG G-3′). All 3CD expression plasmids coding for mutations in 3D sequences were sub-cloned into the pET15b-3CDμ10 expression plasmid. This plasmid encodes a histidine-tagged 3CD protein containing a serine insertion proximal to the 3C/3D junction that essentially eliminates auto-processing at this site without affecting proteinase and RNA binding activities (11Parsley T.B. Towner J.S. Blyn L.B. Ehrenfeld E. Semler B.L. RNA (NY). 1997; 3: 1124-1134PubMed Google Scholar, 23Semler B.L. Johnson V.H. Dewalt P.G. Ypma-Wong M.F. J. Cell.

Site-directed lesions in 3D resulting in clustered charge to alanine mutations at 3D amino acid positions Arg-136 and Asp-137 (pET15b-3CDμ10-AL10), and Glu-226 and Glu-227 (pET15b-3CDμ10-AL14) (19Diamond S.E. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 863-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were generated by incubating the gel-isolated 1110-bpAvrII-AflII restriction fragment of plasmids AL10 and AL14 (kind gifts from Dr. Karla Kirkegaard) with the ∼6700-bpAvrII-AflII restriction fragment of pET15b-3CDμ10 in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. Mutations in 3D sequences coding for 3D-N424H were generated by incubating the gel-isolated 1108-bp AflII-SacI restriction fragment of plasmids pEXC-3CD-3DN424H (20Burns C.C. Richards O.C. Ehrenfeld E. Virology. 1992; 189: 568-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) (a kind gift from Dr. Oliver Richards and Dr. Ellie Ehrenfeld) with the ∼6700-bpAflII-SacI restriction fragment of pET15b-3CDμ10 in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. The single site mutation coding for 3D-K127A was generated using oligonucleotide mismatch mutagenesis (21Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar, 22Nelson M. McClelland M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 279-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) with the Stratagene QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and the following oligonucleotides: 3D K127A+ (5′-GCAATGGGAAAGAAGGCGAGAGACATCTTGAACAA-3′) and 3D K127A− (5′-TTGTTCAAGATGTCTCTCGCCTTCTTTCCCATTGC-3′). Mutations in all expression plasmids were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Wild type and mutated histidine-tagged 3CDμ10 proteins were purified as described previously (11Parsley T.B. Towner J.S. Blyn L.B. Ehrenfeld E. Semler B.L. RNA (NY). 1997; 3: 1124-1134PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modification. Nickel affinity purified recombinant 3CD proteins were subjected to gel filtration chromatography on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Superdex 200 column with continuous buffer flow (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm NaCl, 1 mmDTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% (v/v) glycerol). When necessary, gel filtration fractions were concentrated with Centricon 50 concentrators (Amicon). Radiolabeled 3CD-C147A (a proteolytically inactive form of 3CD (24Lawson M.A. Semler B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9919-9923Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)) substrate was purified from E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring the expression plasmid pET15b-3CD(C147A). Briefly, transformed cells were grown to log phase and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in the presence of [35S]methionine overnight at 26 °C. Induced cells were pelleted, resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A containing 2 mg/ml lysozyme, and incubated on ice for 1 h. Histidine-tagged poliovirus [35S]methionine-labeled 3CD(C147A) was purified from the insoluble fraction of the induced bacterial lysate using nickel affinity chromatography (11Parsley T.B. Towner J.S. Blyn L.B. Ehrenfeld E. Semler B.L. RNA (NY). 1997; 3: 1124-1134PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant histidine-tagged 3C protein was purified from bacterial expression of pET15b-3CD. This expression plasmid (unlike the μ10 version) contains wild type sequences at the 3C/3D cleavage site and thus auto-processing of 3CD to His-3C and -3D occurs during the course of induction. Histidine-tagged 3C was purified from 2 liters of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pET15b-3CD. Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C until they reached an A 600 of ∼0.5 at which time isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Incubation was continued overnight at 26 °C. Cells were then pelleted, resuspended in 30 ml of I30 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 0.5m NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol), lysed in a French pressure cell, and then subjected to sonication (2 bursts for 10 s). These bacterial lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min in a JA20 rotor, and the soluble protein fraction was loaded onto a 1-ml Hi-trap metal chelating column charged with nickel. The column was washed with I60buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 60 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol), and recombinant histidine-tagged 3C (His-3C) was eluted with I200 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol). To remove the histidine tag, purified His-3C was dialyzed overnight in the presence of 50 units of thrombin (Sigma) at 4 °C against 1l of HD buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT). Treatment with thrombin resulted in a molecular weight change consistent with the removal of the histidine tag and generation of the authentic 3C amino terminus. Dialyzed 3C was then subjected to anion exchange chromatography on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Mono-Q column using a constant flow of HD buffer. Purified 3C was recovered in the flow-through fraction. Recombinant PCBP2 protein was purified as previously reported (11Parsley T.B. Towner J.S. Blyn L.B. Ehrenfeld E. Semler B.L. RNA (NY). 1997; 3: 1124-1134PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modification. Peak nickel affinity purified fractions were subjected to gel filtration on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Superdex 200 column with constant buffer flow (5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol (25Brown B.A. Ehrenfeld E. Virology. 1979; 97: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar)). Peak fractions resulting from gel filtration were then used in RNA binding assays. All purified proteins were quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay, and the percent purity of each protein was calculated by densitometric analysis of SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Blue. For enzyme dilution analysis, poliovirus P1 and 2C3AB precursor proteins were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysates programmed within vitro transcribed RNA from plasmids pTM1-P1 2L. E.-C. Leong and B. L. Semler, unpublished observations. and pTM1–2C3AB 3J. S. Towner and B. L. Semler, unpublished results. in the presence of [35S]methionine. 1 μl of either the P1 or 2C3AB (∼25 fmol) translation reaction was then incubated for 2 h at 30 °C in the absence or presence of decreasing amounts of either 3C or 3CD proteinase in a 10-μl reaction containing 24 μg of protein from a HeLa S10 extract and 1 μl of 10× cleavage buffer (final concentration of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, and 150 mm KOAc). Following incubation, 2× Laemmli sample buffer (LSB) was added to each reaction; the mixtures were boiled, and the cleavage products were resolved on a SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gel. For trans-cleavage analysis of 3CD substrate, 10 pmol of purified radiolabeled 3CD(C147A) and 1 μl of 10× cleavage buffer were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C in the absence or presence of decreasing amounts of His-3CD or His-3C in a total reaction volume of 10 μl. Following incubation, 2× LSB was added to each reaction mixture; the mixtures were boiled, and the cleavage products were resolved on a SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gel. For time course kinetic experiments, P1 and P3 polyprotein substrates were translated in vitro in HeLa cell extract in the presence of [35S]methionine (26Todd S. Towner J.S. Semler B.L. Virology. 1997; 229: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmids pT7-PV1-P1(stop) and pT7–5′NCR-P3(C147A) (27Towner J.S. Mazanet M.M. Semler B.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7191-7200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were linearized, in vitrotranscribed with T7 RNA polymerase, and the resulting RNA was used to program HeLa S10 translation extracts. The in vitro translated substrate (50% (v/v) final volume) was diluted in cleavage buffer and preincubated at 30 °C for 15 min. Following preincubation, purified 3C or 3CD was added to a final enzyme concentration of 100 nm, and incubation was continued at 30 °C. 8-μl aliquots were then removed from each reaction and mixed with 8 μl of 2× LSB at 15 and 30 min and 1, 2, 4, and 8 h. Additionally, substrate was incubated at 30 °C in the absence of exogenous proteinase, and time points at 0 and 8 h were taken. Samples were boiled, and cleavage products were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoresis, gels were subjected to fluorography, dried, and exposed to XMR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The ability of recombinant 3C and 3CD proteins to form a ternary complex with RNA sequences representing the first 108 nucleotides of the poliovirus genome (the 5′ cloverleaf) was assessed using modifications (11Parsley T.B. Towner J.S. Blyn L.B. Ehrenfeld E. Semler B.L. RNA (NY). 1997; 3: 1124-1134PubMed Google Scholar, 29Blair W.S. Parsley T.B. Towner J.S. Semler B.L. Cullen B.R. RNA (NY). 1998; 4: 215-225PubMed Google Scholar) of a previously reported RNA mobility shift assay (10Andino R. Rieckhof G.E. Achacoso P.L. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). For this analysis, recombinant purified PCBP2 (200 nm) was preincubated with 0.1 nmradiolabeled RNA representing the first 108 nucleotides of the poliovirus genome for 10 min at 30 °C in RNA binding buffer containing 1 mg/ml E. coli tRNA and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Following preincubation, recombinant histidine-tagged 3C or 3CD protein was added, and the incubation was continued for 5 min at 30 °C. 2.5 μl of 50% glycerol was then added, and complexes were resolved on a non-denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C. Following electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed to XAR film (Kodak). Due to limitations in the quantities of substrate produced using in vitro translation, we were unable to perform kinetic experiments under conditions of saturating substrate. Therefore, we used enzyme dilution and time course experiments to assess the relative proteolytic activities of purified recombinant 3C and 3CD proteinases to process viral polyprotein precursors. Complete processing of the P1 structural precursor by 3C-containing enzymes results in the production of the capsid proteins VP0, VP1, and VP3 (Fig. 1). For the first set of experiments, we used different enzyme dilutions and incubated the cleavage reactions for 2 h at 30 °C. The results of incubation of an in vitro translated P1 precursor with various concentrations of purified 3Cpro (authentic or amino-terminally His-tagged) or 3CDpro (amino-terminally His-tagged) are shown in Fig.2 A. These data demonstrate that the two purified proteinases display differential activities in the processing of P1, a result that is consistent with P1 processing assays utilizing in vitro synthesized 3C and 3CD proteinases (12Ypma-Wong M.F. Dewalt P.G. Johnson V.H. Lamb J.G. Semler B.L. Virology. 1988; 166: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 13Ypma-Wong M.F. Filman D.J. Hogle J.M. Semler B.L. J. Biol.

Virol. 1988; 69: 1627-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As can be seen in lanes 3–7, the P1 precursor was faithfully processed into VP0, VP1, and VP3 capsid proteins by 3CD proteinase, even at the lowest concentration of enzyme (lane 7). However, both the His-3C (lanes 8–12) and 3C proteinases (lanes 13–17) were only able to process P1 at the highest concentrations of enzyme (lanes 8 and13), and processing of P1 by His-3C and 3C was incomplete, as indicated by the presence of 1ABC (VP0-VP3, lanes 8, 9,and 13). Results of this experiment are illustrated graphically in Fig.2 B, which shows the production of either VP1 or VP3 as a function of enzyme concentration. The percentages of VP1 and VP3 were determined by scanning the autoradiograph of Fig. 2 A and using calculations described in the legend to Fig. 2. As indicated by the graph, both 3C enzymes are significantly impaired, relative to 3CD, in their abilities to process the P1 precursor. Comparable cleavage at either the VP0-VP3 or VP3-VP1 junction requires greater than 1000-fold more 3Cpro than 3CDpro, and overall processing of the P1 precursor by 3Cpro is inefficient as indicated by the presence of the 1ABC polyprotein product (Fig. 2 A, lanes 8 and 13). These results illustrate the necessity of the 3D domain in 3CD for complete and efficient in vitroprocessing of the P1 precursor. The diminished proteolytic cleavage properties of 3Cprorelative to 3CDpro seen with the P1 structural precursor are not observed when the non-structural polyprotein precursor 2C-3AB is used as a substrate (Fig. 3). For this analysis, reaction conditions using enzyme dilutions were identical to those detailed above for the P1 precursor. In the case of the 2C-3AB substrate, all three proteinases appear to have similar activities in processing the polyprotein into the 2C and 3AB products (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3–17). Results of this experiment are illustrated graphically in Fig. 3 B where production of 2C was calculated as described in the legend to Fig. 3. We have carried out a kinetic analysis of cleavage of the 2C-3AB substrate at fixed concentrations of His-3C or His-3CD and have confirmed that this substrate is cleaved with equal efficiencies by 3C and 3CD (data not shown). Note also that since the proteolytic activities of the 3C enzymes (amino-terminally histidine-tagged 3C and authentic 3C) appear to be nearly equivalent, the rest of the experiments in this study utilize the histidine-tagged 3C protein as a source of 3Cpro. Poliovirus polypeptide 3CD is a polyprotein that could potentially cleave itself through an intramolecular processing event to generate the mature 3C and 3D protein products (refer to Fig. 1). The relatively high abundance of the 3CD polyprotein compared with the 3C and 3D protein products in a poliovirus-infected cell suggests that if cleavage of the 3C/3D junction does occur in cis, it is a very inefficient processing event (7Lawson M.A. Semler B.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 161: 49-87PubMed Google Scholar). Structural data on the 3C proteinases of both human rhinovirus 14 (HRV14) (28Matthews D.A. Smith W.W. Ferre R.A. Condon B.

Cherney M.M. Sia S. Plotch S. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 1032-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) suggest that the 3C/3D junction is positioned such that it could not fold into the active site cleft and be accessible to intramolecular cleavage. These previous data suggest that the regulation of processing of the 3C/3D junction is mediated through atrans-cleavage event. To assess the relative efficiencies of 3C and 3CD activities on trans-processing of the 3CD precursor, enzyme dilution analysis was performed on a purified, radiolabeled 3CD substrate containing an active site cysteine 147 to alanine mutation (24Lawson M.A. Semler B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9919-9923Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This lesion renders the 3C enzyme proteolytically inactive. Fig.4 A shows the results of incubating radiolabeled 3CD(C147A) substrate in the absence (lanes 2) or presence of decreasing amounts of purified His-3CD (lanes 3–7) or His-3C (lanes 8–12). As seen in lanes 3–7, 3CD is a more effective enzyme at processing the 3C/3D junction than is 3C. Results of this experiment are illustrated graphically in Fig. 4 B, where percentage of 3D was calculated as described in the legend to Fig. 4. Results of this analysis indicate that 3CD is a more effective enzyme intrans-cleavage of 3CD than is 3C with comparable levels of cleavage at the 3C/3D junction requiring up to 100-fold more 3C than 3CD. The experiments presented above demonstrated that 3D amino acid sequences contribute to the overall specificity and proteolytic activity of the 3CD proteinase. To define specific amino acid residues in 3D that contribute to 3CD function, we sub-cloned site-specific lesions coding for amino acid changes 3D-R136A/D137A (AL10), 3D-E226A/E227A/Y264C (AL14), 3D-K127A, and 3D-N424H into the pET15b-3CDμ10 expression vector. Recombinant 3CD proteins containing these mutations were expressed in E. coli, purified, and used (along with wild type 3C and 3CD proteinases) in protein processing assays. For these experiments (shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6), we used a kinetic analysis at fixed enzyme concentrations (100 nm) since we anticipated that this more sensitive analysis might be required to detect less dramatic differences in cleavage activity between wild type and mutant 3CD polypeptides compared with differences previously observed between 3C and 3CD. Shown in Fig. 5 A are the results of time course cleavage assays of the P1 polyprotein precursor. For this experiment, in vitro synthesized P1 substrate was incubated in the absence (lanes 3 and 4) or presence of 100 nm 3C (lanes 5–10) or 3CD (lanes 11–16), and aliquots were removed at the indicated times. Our data demonstrate that 3CD is able to process the P1 precursor much more rapidly and efficiently than is 3C, confirming the differences detected in our enzyme dilution assays shown in Fig. 2. P1 cleavage products appeared as early as 15 min when substrate was incubated with 3CD, whereas comparable levels of processing were not achieved by 3C until 8 h. Processing of P1 by 3C was also less efficient than processing of P1 by 3CD as indicated by the accumulation of the 1ABC intermediate cleavage product in the reactions incubated with 3C (compare lanes 10, 11, and 16).Figure 6Kinetics of P3 processing by 3C and 3CD.

https://openalex.org/W2078919738,"We recently reported that megalin (gp330), an endocytic receptor found on the apical surface of thyroid cells, binds thyroglobulin (Tg) with high affinity in solid phase assays. Megalin-bound Tg was releasable by heparin. Here we show that Fisher rat thyroid (FRTL-5) cells, a differentiated rat thyroid cell line, can bind and endocytose Tg via megalin. We first demonstrated that FRTL-5 cells express megalin in a thyroid-stimulating hormone-dependent manner. Evidence of Tg binding to megalin on FRTL-5 cells and on an immortalized rat renal proximal tubule cell line (IRPT cells), was obtained by incubating the cells with125I-Tg, followed by chemical cross-linking and immunoprecipitation of 125I-Tg with antibodies against megalin. To investigate cell binding further, we developed an assay in which cells were incubated with unlabeled Tg at 4 °C, followed by incubation with heparin, which released almost all of the cell-bound Tg into the medium. In solid phase experiments designed to illuminate the mechanism of heparin release, we demonstrated that Tg is a heparin-binding protein, as are several megalin ligands. The amount of Tg released by heparin from FRTL-5 and IRPT cells, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), was markedly reduced by two megalin competitors, receptor-associated protein (RAP) and 1H2 (monoclonal antibody against megalin), indicating that much of the Tg released by heparin had been bound to megalin (∼60–80%). The amount inhibited by RAP was considered to represent specific binding to megalin, which was saturable and of high affinity (K d∼11.2 nm). Tg endocytosis by FRTL-5 and IRPT cells was demonstrated in experiments in which cells were incubated with unlabeled Tg at 37 °C, followed by heparin to remove cell-bound Tg. The amount of Tg internalized (measured by ELISA in the cell lysates) was reduced by RAP and 1H2, indicating that Tg endocytosis is partially mediated by megalin.

Endocrinol. 1991; 78: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Post-transitional modifications of Tg that occur mainly at the cell-colloid interface lead to forms that are iodine-rich and that contain the thyroid hormones T4 and T3 (mature Tg). Hormone secretion requires uptake of Tg by thyrocytes, with transport to lysosomes, where proteolytic cleavage leads to release of the hormones from mature Tg molecules (1Dunn A. Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. Werner and Ingebar's The Thyroid, A Fundamental And Clinical Text. 7th Ed. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 81-95Google Scholar). Internalization of Tg may result from pseudopod ingestion under certain circumstances, such as intense, acute stimulation by the thyrotropic hormone (TSH), but micropinocytosis (vesicular internalization) is thought to be the usual route (1Dunn A.

We have previously obtained evidence suggesting that megalin (gp330) may function as a receptor for Tg (13Zheng G. Marinò M. Zhao J. McCluskey R.T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1462-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Megalin (gp330) is a member of the LDL receptor family (14Raychowdhury R. Niles J.L. McCluskey R.T. Smith J.A.

In immunohistochemical studies, megalin has been found principally on the apical surface of a restricted group of absorptive epithelial cells, including renal proximal tubule cells, epididymal cells, type II pneumocytes, and thyroid epithelial cells (19Zheng G. Bachinsky D.R. Stamenkovic I. Strickland D.K. Brown D. Andres G. McCluskey R.T. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 20Lundgren S. Carling T. Hjalm G. Juhlin C. Rastad J. Pihlgren U. Rask L. Akerstrom G. Hellman P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Based on the assumption that physiological ligands of megalin may be identified by consideration of the composition of fluids to which it is exposed in various organs (21Zheng G. Bachinsky D. Abbate M. Andres G. Brown D. Stamenkovic I. Niles J.L. McCluskey R.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we postulated that megalin on thyrocytes serves as a receptor for Tg. In support of this possibility we demonstrated in solid phase assays that purified rat megalin binds to rat Tg with high affinity (13Zheng G. Marinò M. Zhao J. McCluskey R.T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1462-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Binding was inhibited by several known competitors of megalin, including the receptor-associated protein (RAP), antibodies to megalin, and heparin, which in addition dissociated Tg bound to megalin (13Zheng G. Marinò M. Zhao J. McCluskey R.T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1462-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the present study we have investigated FRTL-5 cells to determine whether they express megalin and if they are capable of binding and internalizing Tg via megalin. FRTL-5 cells, an established rat thyroid cell line, exhibit a number of thyroid-specific functions in a TSH-dependent manner (22Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Parks L.A.M. Coon H.G. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar,23Bidey S.P. Chiovato L. Day A. Turmaine M. Gould R.P. Ekins R.P. Marshall N.J. J. Endocrinol. 1984; 101: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Here we show that FRTL-5 cells do express megalin and that they can bind and endocytose Tg via megalin. Tg was purified from rat thyroids by ammonium sulfate precipitation and column fractionation, as described previously (24Esquivel P.S. Rose N.R. Kong Y.M. J. Exp. Med. 1977; 145: 1250-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The Tg preparations were analyzed by Western blotting, using a rabbit anti-human Tg antibody cross-reactive with Tg from other species (Axle-Westbury, NY). Two bands were seen at about 330 and 660 kDa, corresponding to the monomeric and the dimeric forms of Tg. The RAP was used in the form of a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. DH5α bacteria harboring the pGEX-RAP expression construct were kindly provided by Dr. Joachim Herz (University of Texas Southern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The production of RAP-GST and GST was performed as described (25Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin (Sigma) was used because it inhibits Tg binding to megalin in solid phase assays (13Zheng G. Marinò M. Zhao J. McCluskey R.T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1462-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), as occurs for binding of other megalin ligands (26Kounnas M.Z. Stefansson S. Loukinova E. Argraves K.M. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, heparin dissociates Tg bound to megalin (13Zheng G. Marinò M. Zhao J. McCluskey R.T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1462-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and releases ligands that are bound to members of the LDL receptor family (27Goldstein L.J. Basu S.K. Brunschede G.Y. Brown M.S. Cell. 1976; 7: 85-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). A rabbit antibody, designated A55, against immunoaffinity purified megalin was described previously (28Gutmann E.J. Niles J.L. McCluskey R.T. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C397-C407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Raychowdhury R. Zheng G. Brown D. McCluskey R.T. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1613-1623PubMed Google Scholar). A previously described mouse anti-megalin monoclonal antibody, designated 1H2, has been shown to react with ectodomain epitopes in the second cluster of ligand binding repeats (29Raychowdhury R. Zheng G. Brown D. McCluskey R.T. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1613-1623PubMed Google Scholar). A rabbit antibody against RAP-GST and a mouse antibody against the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) were previously described (19Zheng G. Bachinsky D.R. Stamenkovic I. Strickland D.K. Brown D. Andres G. McCluskey R.T. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The above antibodies were used as purified IgG preparations unless otherwise specified. A goat antibody against GST was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Bio-Rad. ALP-conjugated mouse anti-goat IgG was obtained from Axle. Horseradish peroxidase- and ALP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Sigma. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Cappel (Durham, NC). Biotin-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Vector (Burlingame, CA). 200 μg of rat Tg were radiolabeled with 125I-Na (NEN Life Science Products) using IODO beads (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specific activity of the preparations ranged from 1,500 to 7,000 cpm/ng. Fisher rat thyroid cells (FRTL-5) (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured as described previously (22Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Parks L.A.M. Coon H.G. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 23Bidey S.P. Chiovato L. Day A. Turmaine M. Gould R.P. Ekins R.P. Marshall N.J. J.

In some experiments the medium was replaced with fresh medium lacking TSH for 24 h, after which TSH was sometimes readded. An immortalized rat renal proximal tubule cell line (IRPT), which expresses megalin but not LRP, was established as described previously (30Jung F.F. Bachinsky D.R. Tang S.S. Zheng G. Diamant D. Haveran L. McCluskey R.T. Ingelfinger J.R. Kid. Int. 1998; 53: 358-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 31Tang S.S. Jung F. Diamant D. Ingelfinger J. Exp. Nephrol. 1994; 2: 127PubMed Google Scholar). IRPT cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. CHO cells, a Chinese hamster ovary cell line that lacks megalin and expresses LRP (32Ji Z.S. Brecht W.J. Miranda R.D. Hussain M.H. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10160-10167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were cultured in Ham's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were detached from the plates, washed with Tris buffered-saline (TBS), and incubated in plastic tubes for 1 h at 4 °C with the mouse monoclonal anti-megalin antibody (1H2), with the rabbit polyclonal anti-megalin antibody (A55), with the anti-LRP antibody (tissue culture supernatant), or, as controls, with purified mouse or rabbit IgG. Anti-megalin antibodies and control IgGs were used at a concentration of 20 μg/ml in binding buffer (TBS, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5% fetal bovine serum). After washing with TBS, FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:250) or goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1500) secondary antibodies were added for 1 h at 4 °C in binding buffer. Cells were then washed and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCAN from Becton Dickinson (Mountain View, CA). Cell extracts were prepared with 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate (both from Fisher) and were briefly sonicated. The extracts were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, which were incubated with tissue culture supernatant containing the mouse monoclonal anti-megalin antibody (1H2) or with the rabbit polyclonal anti-megalin antibody (A55), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies. Bands were detected using a chemiluminescent substrate kit (Kirkegard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Cells were cultured on glass coverslips and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde-l-lysine-sodium periodate. The preparations were blocked with avidin D (0.1 mg/ml in PBS) and incubated with tissue culture supernatant containing the mouse monoclonal anti-megalin antibody (1H2) followed by biotin-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:200 in PBS) or with the secondary antibody alone. Staining was detected using the peroxidase labeled biotin-avidin complex (Vector). 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine (Sigma) was used for the color reaction. Cells were incubated with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h at 37 °C and then blocked in 0.5% ovalbumin (OVA, Sigma), 25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0, for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated with 10 nm of 125I-Tg for 4 h at 4 °C in blocking buffer, followed by cross-linking with the homobifunctional cross-linker 3,3′-dithiobis[sulfosuccinimidyl propionate] (Pierce) (0.5 mm in PBS) for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing with TBS, cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate and briefly sonicated. Cell lysates (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated with the rabbit anti-megalin antibody (A55 anti-serum, 1:200) or with the rabbit anti-human Tg antibody (1:200), or, as control, with normal rabbit serum, using protein A beads (Pierce). The precipitates were separated by 4–16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions and analyzed by autoradiography. Radioactivity in the cell lysates and in the precipitates was counted with a γ counter. Cells were cultured in 96-well tissue culture plates until 80–100% confluence was reached. Cells were incubated with unlabeled Tg or, as controls, with RAP-GST or GST in Coon's F12 medium containing 5 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% OVA. For inhibition experiments, FRTL-5 and IRPT cells were incubated with Tg alone, or in the presence of megalin inhibitors, namely RAP-GST (200 μg/ml) or 1H2 (200 μg/ml) or, as controls, with GST (200 μg/ml) or normal mouse IgG (200 μg/ml). After 4 h of incubation at 4 °C, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS to remove nonspecifically bound proteins and then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with ice-cold heparin (10–100 units/ml in PBS), to release receptor-bound proteins from the cell surface. In certain experiments, to measure total cell-bound Tg, cell lysates were prepared by treating the cells with ice-cold H2O on ice, immediately after incubation with Tg at 4 °C. The amounts of Tg, RAP-GST or GST in the heparin wash or in the cell lysates were measured by ELISA. For this purpose, 96-well microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with the heparin wash or with the cell lysates, blocked with bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and incubated with rabbit anti-human Tg (1:500), rabbit anti-RAP (20 μg/ml), or goat anti-GST (1:1000) antibodies, followed by ALP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:3000) or mouse anti-goat IgG (1:2500) secondary antibodies. After incubation withp-nitrophenyl-phosphate (Sigma), absorbance at 405 nm was determined with an El–311 ELISA microplate reader. The amount of Tg, RAP-GST, or GST was calculated using a standard obtained by coating the wells with 10 μg/ml of purified Tg, RAP-GST, or GST and was normalized for the total amount of protein in the cell lysates, measured with a commercial kit (Bio-Rad). 96-well microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with rat Tg or, as control, with OVA, at a concentration of 100 μg/ml in PBS. After blocking with bovine serum albumin, plates were incubated for 3 h at room temperature with a biotin-labeled heparin-albumin complex (Sigma) or, as control, with biotin-labeled albumin (Sigma) (in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.5% bovine serum albumin), followed by ALP-conjugated streptavidin (Vector, 1:3000) andp-nitrophenyl-phosphate. Absorbance was determined at 405 nm. For inhibition experiments, biotin-labeled heparin-albumin was added to the wells alone or in the presence of unlabeled heparin (500 units/ml). Cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates and cultured until 80–100% confluence was reached. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C with unlabeled rat Tg or, as controls, with unlabeled RAP-GST or GST in Coon's F12 medium containing 5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmMgCl2, and 0.5% OVA. For inhibition experiments, Tg (10 μg/ml) was added to the plates together with one of the following: RAP-GST (200 μg/ml), 1H2 (200 μg/ml), or, as controls, GST (200 μg/ml) or normal mouse IgG (200 μg/ml). After 6 h of incubation the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with ice-cold heparin, as described above, to remove cell surface bound proteins, which were measured by ELISA. The cells were then lysed to measure internalized Tg, RAP-GST, or GST, using deionized H2O on ice. The amount of cell protein was measured in an aliquot of the cell lysate. Internalized Tg, RAP-GST or GST were measured in the cell lysates by ELISA, as described above. As shown in Fig.1 A, FRTL-5 cells were found to express megalin by FACS analysis, using either the mouse monoclonal (1H2) or the rabbit polyclonal (A55) anti-megalin antibodies. In addition, immunoperoxidase staining with 1H2 demonstrated surface megalin on FRTL-5 cells (Fig. 1 B). Megalin was also detected in FRTL-5 cell extracts by Western blotting (Fig. 1 C). In agreement with previous reports (30Jung F.F. Bachinsky D.R. Tang S.S. Zheng G. Diamant D. Haveran L. McCluskey R.T. Ingelfinger J.R. Kid. Int. 1998; 53: 358-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 31Tang S.S. Jung F. Diamant D. Ingelfinger J. Exp. Nephrol. 1994; 2: 127PubMed Google Scholar), IRPT cells were found to express megalin by FACS analysis, whereas megalin was not detected on CHO cells (not shown). Because LRP binds many of the same ligands as megalin, we studied its expression on FRTL-5 cells by FACS analysis and, as shown in Fig. 1 D, no LRP was found. In a previous study we showed that IRPT cells do not express surface LRP (30Jung F.F. Bachinsky D.R. Tang S.S. Zheng G. Diamant D. Haveran L. McCluskey R.T. Ingelfinger J.R. Kid. Int. 1998; 53: 358-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To investigate whether megalin expression by FRTL-5 cells is regulated by TSH, cells were cultured for 24 h in medium lacking TSH, sometimes followed by 48 h of culture in fresh medium containing TSH. As shown in Fig. 2, megalin expression was reduced at 24 h after TSH deprivation, as assessed by FACS analysis. The staining for megalin ranged from 46 to 69% of the staining before TSH deprivation, depending on the antibody used. Readdition of TSH resulted in increased megalin expression, reaching 88–90% of the levels found before TSH deprivation. The results indicate that TSH is required for high levels of megalin expression on FRTL-5 cells. In experiments designed to obtain evidence of Tg binding to cell surface megalin, FRTL-5 and IRPT cells were incubated with 125I-Tg at 4 °C, followed by cross-linking and immunoprecipitation with anti-Tg or anti-megalin antibodies. As shown in Fig.3 A, both anti-Tg and anti-megalin antibodies produced a high molecular mass band at the same size, indicating Tg bound to megalin on the cell surface. Another band at approximately 50 kDa was produced by the anti-megalin antibody and not by the anti-Tg antibody. The identity of this product is unknown. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the proportion of 125I-Tg precipitated by the rabbit anti-Tg antibody from FRTL-5 cells was 19.9% of the total amount of 125I-Tg in the cell lysates, whereas that obtained from IRPT cells was 11.39%. The results are consistent with the presence of Tg receptors on thyroid cells in addition to megalin, as suggested by previous studies (1Dunn A. Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D.

The proportion of 125I-Tg precipitated by the anti-megalin antibody was 8.48% from FRTL-5 cells and 11.81% from IRPT cells. We previously showed that heparin dissociates Tg from megalin in solid phase assays (13Zheng G. Marinò M. Zhao J. McCluskey R.T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1462-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here we studied the ability of heparin to dissociate Tg bound to megalin on cells, to be used as a measure of cell bound Tg. Cells were incubated with unlabeled Tg at 4 °C, followed by incubation with heparin. In addition, some cells were incubated with RAP (used as a RAP-GST fusion protein), as a positive megalin binding control, or with GST, as a negative control, before heparin treatment. The amounts of Tg, RAP-GST, and GST in the heparin wash were measured by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 4 A, heparin was found to release Tg and RAP-GST from FRTL-5 and IRPT cells. Although FRTL-5 cells are capable of synthesizing Tg (22Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Parks L.A.M. Coon H.G. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2069826620,"To understand the mechanisms of prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α)-induced protein synthesis in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), we have studied its effect on two major signal transduction pathways: mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and their downstream targets ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6k) and eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E and its regulator 4E-BP1. PGF2α induced the activities of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) and Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) groups of mitogen-activated protein kinases, PI3-kinase, and p70S6k in a time-dependent manner in growth-arrested VSMC. PGF2α also induced eIF4E and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, global protein synthesis, and basic fibroblast growth factor-2 (bFGF-2) expression in VSMC. Whereas inhibition of PI3-kinase by wortmannin completely blocked the p70S6k activation, it only partially decreased the ERK2 activity, and had no significant effect on global protein synthesis and bFGF-2 expression induced by PGF2α. Rapamycin, a potent inhibitor of p70S6k, also failed to prevent PGF2α-induced global protein synthesis and bFGF-2 expression, although it partially decreased ERK2 activity. In contrast, inhibition of ERK2 activity by PD 098059 led to a significant loss of PGF2α-induced eIF4E and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, global protein synthesis, and bFGF-2 expression. PGF2α-induced phosphorylation of eIF4E and 4E-BP1 was also found to be sensitive to inhibition by both wortmannin and rapamycin. These findings demonstrate that 1) PI3-kinase-dependent and independent mechanisms appear to be involved in PGF2α-induced activation of ERK2; 2) PGF2α-induced eIF4E and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation appear to be mediated by both ERK-dependent and PI3-kinase-dependent rapamycin-sensitive mechanisms; and 3) ERK-dependent eIF4E phosphorylation but not PI3-kinase-dependent p70S6k activation correlates with PGF2α-induced global protein synthesis and bFGF-2 expression in VSMC. To understand the mechanisms of prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α)-induced protein synthesis in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), we have studied its effect on two major signal transduction pathways: mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and their downstream targets ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6k) and eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E and its regulator 4E-BP1.

PGF2α also induced eIF4E and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, global protein synthesis, and basic fibroblast growth factor-2 (bFGF-2) expression in VSMC. Whereas inhibition of PI3-kinase by wortmannin completely blocked the p70S6k activation, it only partially decreased the ERK2 activity, and had no significant effect on global protein synthesis and bFGF-2 expression induced by PGF2α. Rapamycin, a potent inhibitor of p70S6k, also failed to prevent PGF2α-induced global protein synthesis and bFGF-2 expression, although it partially decreased ERK2 activity. In contrast, inhibition of ERK2 activity by PD 098059 led to a significant loss of PGF2α-induced eIF4E and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, global protein synthesis, and bFGF-2 expression. PGF2α-induced phosphorylation of eIF4E and 4E-BP1 was also found to be sensitive to inhibition by both wortmannin and rapamycin. These findings demonstrate that 1) PI3-kinase-dependent and independent mechanisms appear to be involved in PGF2α-induced activation of ERK2; 2) PGF2α-induced eIF4E and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation appear to be mediated by both ERK-dependent and PI3-kinase-dependent rapamycin-sensitive mechanisms; and 3) ERK-dependent eIF4E phosphorylation but not PI3-kinase-dependent p70S6k activation correlates with PGF2α-induced global protein synthesis and bFGF-2 expression in VSMC.

Another event that is critical in the regulation of protein synthesis is the binding of mRNA to ribosomes, which is facilitated by a translation initiation complex, eIF4F (1Rhoads R.E.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1220: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). eIF4F consists of three polypeptides as follows: eIF4A, an RNA helicase; eIF4E, the cap-binding protein; and eIF4G, a bridging protein for eIF4A and eIF4E (7Sonenberg N.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21677-21680Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The binding of eIF4F to mRNA is catalyzed by its smallest subunit eIF4E via interaction with the cap structure present in the 5′ of the eukaryotic mRNAs (1Rhoads R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 52-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 3Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). eIF4F in combination with another initiation factor, eIF4B, is thought to unwind the mRNA secondary structure thereby rendering it capable of binding to ribosomes (3Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Because of its lowest abundance and its critical role in mRNA binding to ribosomes, eIF4E is considered to be a regulator of protein synthesis (1Rhoads R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 52-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 3Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). In fact, eIF4E activity has been reported to be regulated by several kinase cascades including protein kinase C and Mnk1, a downstream target of MAPKs (14Morley S.J. Dever T.E. Etchison D.

Of interest, receptor tyrosine kinase agonists such as platelet-derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) cause a hyperplastic effect in these cells, whereas G protein-coupled receptor agonists such as angiotensin II (ang II), endothelin, and PGF2α often induce a hypertrophic effect (21Ross R.

All three of the latter agonists mediate their effects via Gq-coupled receptors whose activation is characterized by increases in phospholipase C activity and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (27Murphy T.J.

Although PGF2α, a cyclooxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid that is produced in a variety of cells in response to various stimuli including oxidant stress, has been shown to be a potent hypertrophic agonist for cardiac myocytes and VSMC, the mechanisms underlying this effect are largely unclear. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the signaling events that are evoked in response to PGF2α leading to increased protein synthesis in VSMC. We found that PGF2α activates ERK2 and JNK1 groups of MAPKs, PI3-kinase, and p70S6k and induces phosphorylation of the translation regulators eIF4E and 4E-BP1 in VSMC. We also show a correlation between PGF2α-induced ERKs activation, eIF4E and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, global protein synthesis, and bFGF-2 expression. In addition, the present findings suggest that ERK-dependent and PI3-kinase-dependent rapamycin-sensitive mechanisms modulate PGF2α-induced eIF4E and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in VSMC. Aprotinin, ATP, bovine myelin basic protein, dibutyryl cyclic AMP (cAMP), EGTA, β-glycerophosphate, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), phosphatidylinositol, sodium deoxycholate, sodium fluoride, sodium orthovanadate, and sodium pyrophosphate were obtained from Sigma. Prostaglandin F2αwas from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Silica gel 60A thin layer chromatography plates and P81 phosphocellulose filter paper were purchased from Whatman. Anti-ERK2 (sc-154), anti-JNK1 (sc-474), anti-p70S6k (sc-230), and anti-FGF-2 (sc-79) rabbit polyclonal antibodies and GST-c-Jun-(1–79) (sc-4113) recombinant protein were bought from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-PI3-kinase rabbit polyclonal antibody (06-195) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-phospho-p38 MAPK antibodies and PD 098059 were provided by New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Rapamycin and wortmannin were from Calbiochem. [35S]Methionine (1000 Ci/mmol), [32P]orthophosphoric acid (8500 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (8000 Ci/mmol), and [methyl- 3H]thymidine (70 Ci/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. VSMC were isolated from the thoracic aortae of 200–300-g male Sprague-Dawley rats by enzymatic dissociation as described earlier (33Rao G.N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 713-719PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were growth-arrested by incubating in Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium containing 0.1% calf serum for 72 h. Growth-arrested VSMC were treated with known concentrations of PGF2α for the indicated periods or were left untreated. To study the effect of the inhibitors of various kinases on PGF2α-induced VSMC responses, cells were pretreated for 30 min with the inhibitors prior to stimulation with PGF2α. After appropriate treatments, medium was aspirated, and cells were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Two hundred-fifty microliters of lysis buffer (PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml PMSF, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4)) was added to the frozen monolayers, thawed on ice for 15 min, and scraped into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein content of the supernatants was determined using Bradford reagent from Bio-Rad. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were resolved by electrophoresis on 0.1% SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels. The protein was transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After blocking in 10 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk, the membrane was treated with appropriate primary antibodies followed by incubation with appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected using chemiluminescence reagent kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After appropriate treatments, cells were washed with cold PBS and solubilized on ice for 15 min in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 2 μm leupeptin, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 400 μm PMSF. The cell lysates normalized for protein were immunoprecipitated by incubating with anti-ERK2 and anti-JNK1 antibodies for ERK2 and JNK1 assays, respectively, for 2 h followed by addition of 40 μl of 50% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose beads for an additional hour. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, three times with wash buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 500 mm lithium chloride, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and three times with kinase buffer (12.5 mm Mops, pH 7.5, 12.5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.5 mm Na3VO4). The ERK2 activity present in the immunoprecipitates was determined by resuspension in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μg of myelin basic protein, 20 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubation at 30 °C for 20 min. For JNK1 assay, incubation with the kinase buffer was the same as that for ERK2 assay except that 1 μg of GST-c-Jun-(1–79) was used instead of myelin basic protein (34Rao G.N. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20805-20810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The reactions were stopped by adding 20 μl of 4× Laemmli sample buffer and heating the samples at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on 0.1% SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels. The dried gel was exposed to X-Omat AR x-ray film with an intensifying screen for 1 to 4 h at −80 °C and developed. For determination of p38 MAPK activity, an equal amount of protein from control and test samples was analyzed by Western blotting for phosphorylated p38 MAPK using its phosphospecific antibodies. After appropriate treatments, cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2 μm leupeptin, 10 units/ml aprotinin, and 400 μm PMSF) for 20 min on ice. The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Five hundred micrograms of protein from control and each treatment was immunoprecipitated with 5 μl of anti-PI3-kinase antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 40 μl of 50% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose beads for an additional hour. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, three times with wash buffer, and three times with TNF buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 μmNa3VO4). The kinase activity was measured by resuspending the immunoprecipitates in 30 μl of TNF buffer and incubating with 10 μl of 2 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol, 10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2, 2 μl of 100 mm ATP, and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 22 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 20 μl of 5 n HCl and 200 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1) mix. The aqueous and organic phases were separated by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The organic phase containing the phosphoinositol phosphates was spotted onto silica gel 60A TLC plate coated with 1% potassium oxalate and developed in a solvent system consisting of chloroform:methanol:water:ammonium hydroxide (90:70:14.6:5.4). The TLC plate was exposed to X-Omat AR x-ray film for 4–6 h at −80 °C and developed. Growth-arrested VSMC were metabolically labeled with 300 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 4 h at 37 °C and subjected to appropriate treatments. After treatments, medium was aspirated, and cells were rinsed with cold PBS and lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EGTA, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 0.5 mmPMSF) for 20 min on ice. The cell lysates were collected into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein from each condition were incubated with 5 μl of eIF4E or 4E-BP1 polyclonal antibodies (35Frederickson R.M. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2896-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 36Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y. Belsham G.J. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Forty microliters of 10% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and incubation was continued for another 2 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C and washed five times with cold lysis buffer and once with cold PBS. The beads were heated in 40 μl of Laemmli sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min. The proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 0.1% SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to X-Omat AR x-ray film with an intensifying screen for 2–4 h at −80 °C and developed. Growth-arrested VSMC were treated with the indicated concentrations of PGF2α for the indicated times or were left untreated. Protein and DNA syntheses were measured by labeling cells with 1 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine, respectively. After labeling, cells were washed with cold PBS, trypsinized, and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was suspended in cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and vortexed vigorously to lyse cells. After standing on ice for 20 min, the mixture was passed through a glass fiber filter (GF/C, Whatman). The filter was washed once with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and once with cold 70% (v/v) ethanol. The filter was dried, placed in a liquid scintillation vial containing the mixture, and the radioactivity measured in a liquid scintillation counter (LS 3801, Beckman). All the experiments were repeated at least three times with similar pattern of results. Statistical analysis was performed by Student'st test. p values < 0.05 were considered to be significant. To test the hypertrophic effect of PGF2α in VSMC, we first studied the dose-response effect of PGF2α on protein synthesis. Growth-arrested VSMC were treated with and without various concentrations of PGF2α for 24 h, and protein synthesis was determined by [35S]methionine incorporation. As shown in Fig.1 A, PGF2αinduced protein synthesis in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum effect (2-fold) at 1 μm. Increase in protein synthesis by PGF2α occurred in a time-dependent manner as well (Fig. 1 B). Earlier studies have reported that PGF2α causes mitogenesis in some cell types (30Watanabe T. Waga I. Honda Z. Kurokawa K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8984-8990Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To find whether PGF2α-induced increase in protein synthesis is due to stimulation of cell division, we tested its effect on DNA synthesis. PGF2α had no significant effect on VSMC DNA synthesis as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 1 C). Serum (10% v/v), which served as a positive control, stimulated VSMC DNA synthesis by 2-fold as compared with control. These results clearly indicate that PGF2α induces protein synthesis without an effect on DNA synthesis in VSMC. To understand the signal transduction pathways of PGF2α-induced protein synthesis, we first studied the role of MAPKs. Growth-arrested VSMC were treated with and without 1 μm PGF2α for various times or with different concentrations of PGF2α for 10 min, and the MAPK activities were determined. ERK2 and JNK1 activities were measured by immunocomplex kinase assay using myelin basic protein and GST-c-Jun-(1–79) as substrates, respectively, whereas p38 MAPK activation was determined by Western blotting using its phosphospecific antibodies. PGF2α activated ERK2 and JNK1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig.2, A–D). Activation of ERK2 by PGF2α was maximum (7-fold) at 10 min, and thereafter it declined gradually reaching almost basal levels by 60 min (Fig. 2 A). PGF2α also activated JNK1 with a peak activity (4-fold) at 10 min, which then persisted at least for 60 min (Fig. 2 B). Dose-response study showed that PGF2α at 1 μm concentration was found to be more potent in the activation of ERK2 (Fig. 2 C), whereas higher concentrations appear to be more effective in the activation of JNK1 (Fig. 2 D). PGF2α, however, had no significant effect on the activation of p38 MAPK in VSMC (Fig.2 E).

A role for PI3-kinase was implicated both in receptor tyrosine kinase and GPCR agonist-induced activation of MAPKs (37Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

To find whether PGF2α activates PI3-kinase in VSMC, growth-arrested cells were treated with and without 1 μm PGF2αfor various times, and the PI3-kinase activity was measured. PGF2α induced PI3-kinase activity in a time-dependent manner in VSMC with a peak activity (6-fold) at 10 min (Fig. 3, upper panel). The PI3-kinase activity was further confirmed by its sensitivity to inhibition by wortmannin (Fig. 3, lower panel) (40Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Pierce J.H. Blenis J. White M.F.

To determine the role of PI3-kinase and rapamycin-sensitive targets in PGF2α-induced activation of ERKs, growth-arrested VSMC were treated with and without 1 μm PGF2α in the presence and absence of different concentrations of wortmannin or 50 ng/ml rapamycin, and ERK2 activity was measured. Wortmannin inhibited the PGF2α-induced ERK2 activity in a concentration-dependent manner with maximum effect (>50%) at 1 μm (Fig.4 A). Rapamycin also partially (35%) decreased the PGF2α-induced ERK2 activity. On the other hand, PD 098059 (50 μm), a potent and specific inhibitor of MEK1 (42Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T.

To determine whether PI3-kinase and rapamycin-sensitive targets also modulate PGF2α-induced JNK1 activity, we tested the effect of wortmannin (1 μm) and rapamycin (50 ng/ml) on the activation of JNK1 by PGF2α. As shown in Fig.4 B, wortmannin had no effect on PGF2α-induced JNK1 activation. Rapamycin also did not affect the JNK1 activation by PGF2α (data not shown).Figure 4Effect of wortmannin, rapamycin, and PD 098059 on PGF 2α -induced activation of MAPKs.

Precursor proteins must be at least partially unfolded during import into mitochondria, but their actual conformation during translocation is not known.

The folding pathway of most proteins in vitrocontains a partially folded intermediate known as the molten globule state, and it has been suggested that proteins are in the molten globule state during translocation across membranes. Here we show that precursors are normally fully unfolded during import into mitochondria. However, precursors containing residual structure can be imported, if less efficiently. Approximately half of all proteins synthesized in a eukaryotic cell are transported into or across a membrane during their life cycle. Cells have developed elaborate protein translocation systems, which share several characteristic features (1Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Protein unfolding is intimately associated with translocation, because proteins do not maintain their native state during translocation but can be folded both before and after translocation. Here we determine the structure of precursor proteins during import into mitochondria. Precursor proteins are not in their native conformation during translocation into mitochondria (2Rassow J. Hartl F.-U. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Neupert N. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), but it is not known how extensively they unfold. Are precursors fully unfolded and threaded through the import machinery amino acid by amino acid, or do they retain some partial structure during transport? Although precursor proteins can be fully unfolded during translocation (2Rassow J. Hartl F.-U. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Neupert N. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), the protein import machinery permits the passage of bulky groups such as branched polypeptides (3Vestweber D. Schatz G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2045-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and precursors with a single- or double-stranded oligonucleotide attached to the C terminus (4Vestweber D. Schatz G. Nature. 1989; 338: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs of the protein-conducting channel of the outer mitochondrial membrane reconstituted in lipid vesicles suggest that it has an internal diameter of ∼20 Å at its entrance (5Kunkele K.P. Heins S. Dembowski M. Nargang F.E. Benz R. Thieffry M. Walz J. Lill R. Nussberger S. Neupert W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1009-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological measurements estimate its internal diameter to be ∼22 Å (6Hill K. Model K. Ryan M.T. Dietmeier K. Martin F. Wagner R. Pfanner N. Nature. 1998; 395: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mitochondrial import machinery may tolerate the passage of proteins that have retained some residual structure, such as secondary structural elements. It has been proposed that proteins retain residual structure during translocation, as in the molten globule state (7van der Goot F.G. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 8Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molten globule is an in vitro folding intermediate observed on the refolding pathways of most proteins (8Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is defined as a state in which the protein lacks defined tertiary structure but retains secondary structural elements. Many biological membranes contain negatively charged lipids, and these lipids are expected to increase the local proton and cation concentrations at the membrane surface (9McLaughlin S. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1977; 9: 71-144Crossref Scopus (777) Google Scholar,10Eisenberg M. Gresalfi T. Riccio T. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5213-5223Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The decreased pH at the surface of phospholipid vesicles induces the molten globule state in the protein toxin colicin A, which allows the toxin to undergo the conformational changes necessary to insert into the membrane (11van der Goot F.G. Gonzalez-Manas J.M. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Nature. 1991; 354: 408-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The outer mitochondrial membrane also contains negatively charged phospholipids (12Tzagoloff A. Mitochondria. Plenum, New York1982Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that these charges contribute to the unfolding of precursors (13Eilers M. Hwang S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Therefore, the surface of mitochondria may induce molten globule formation in precursors before import. Urea-denatured precursor proteins refolded in the presence of mitochondria are imported faster than native precursors, even after long incubations at low temperature (13Eilers M. Hwang S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This acceleration of import is not observed when proteins are renatured in the absence of membranes. It appears that in the presence of mitochondrial membranes denatured precursors do not refold to their native state but into a translocation-competent folding intermediate, which may be the molten globule state (8Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether proteins are transported through membranes as folding intermediates or whether, before translocation, proteins only transiently form the intermediate and then unfold completely. In this study we investigate whether precursor proteins retain residual structure during translocation into mitochondria by determining import kinetics for a series of precursors into which we introduced disulfide bridges that covalently cross-link two, three, four, or five of the strands of a β-sheet. Because mitochondria have no mechanism for reducing disulfides at their surface (14Vestweber D. Schatz G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2037-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), disulfide bridges make it impossible for the import machinery to separate the cross-linked strands. If the β-sheet persisted during translocation, locking the structure with disulfide bridges would have no effect on import. On the other hand, if preventing β-strands from separating completely during import inhibits translocation relative to translocation of wild-type protein, the β-sheet is not normally present during import. We show that proteins are normally fully unfolded during import and not in the molten globule state. However, precursors containing residual structure can be imported, if less efficiently. Mitochondrial precursor proteins, consisting of a presequence fused to the N terminus of a passenger protein, were constructed using standard molecular biology techniques in pGEM-3Zf(+) vectors (Promega, Madison, WI) and verified by DNA sequencing. The presequence was derived from the first 95 amino acids of yeast cytochrome b 2 (15Matouschek A. Azem A. Ratliff K. Glick B.S. Schmid K. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6727-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), starting at the initiator methionine. The presequence contained a Cys14→ Ser mutation to prevent disulfide bond formation between targeting sequences, an Arg30 → Gly mutation to prevent processing by the mitochondrial matrix processing protease (16Arretz M. Schneider H. Guiard B. Brunner M. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4959-4967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a Leu62 → Pro mutation to target the precursor to the mitochondrial matrix (17Beasley E.M. Müller S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2303-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The passenger protein was barnase, a ribonuclease from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (18Hartley R.W. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2367-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition to the introduction of cysteine residues, barnase contained two further mutations: one changing His102 of the authentic barnase sequence to Ala to inactivate barnase (19Mossakowska D.E. Nyberg K. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3843-3850Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and one mutating Gln2 of barnase to Met to allow radioactive labeling. Radioactive precursors were expressed from a T7 promoter by in vitro transcription and translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) supplemented with [35S]methionine and partially purified by high speed centrifugation and ammonium sulfate precipitation as described (15Matouschek A. Azem A. Ratliff K. Glick B.S. Schmid K. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6727-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain D273-10B (MATα, ATCC 25657) (20Hase T. Muller U. Riezman H. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 3157-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and purified by centrifugation through a Nycodenz gradient (21Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Three single disulfide bridge mutants and one double disulfide bridge mutant were described previously (22Clarke J. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4322-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). To link β-strands 4 and 5 covalently, residues 96 and 110 of barnase were mutated to Cys. The positions of the cysteine mutations were selected by using the program EDPDB (23Zhang X.J. Matthews B.W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 624-630Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and visual inspection of the barnase structure (24Mauguen Y. Hartley R.W. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Bricogne G. Chothia C. Jack A. Nature. 1982; 297: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) using the program Xtalview (25McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). To induce disulfide bridge formation between Cys residues, precursors were oxidized with 10 mm K3Fe(CN)6 for 2 min at room temperature before precipitation with ammonium sulfate. In other experiments disulfide bridge formation was prevented by resuspending ammonium sulfate-precipitated precursors in import buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; SDSM, stilbene disulfonate maleimide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis To test for disulfide bridge formation, unreacted cysteine residues were modified with 4-acetamido-4′-maleididylstilbene-2,2′ disulfonic acid (stilbene disulfonate maleimide (SDSM), Molecular Probes) and detected through a change in mobility of the modified proteins in SDS-PAGE. Precursors were oxidized with K3Fe(CN)6, partially purified by precipitation with ammonium sulfate, and reacted with 0.1 mm SDSM at 25 °C for 2 h in the dark. SDSM modification was detected through gel shift after autoradiography andN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine-SDS-PAGE (26Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Import kinetics of precursor proteins into purified yeast mitochondria were performed at 20 °C essentially as described previously (15Matouschek A. Azem A. Ratliff K. Glick B.S. Schmid K. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6727-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, radiolabeled precursors were treated with K3Fe(CN)6 or DTT to form or break disulfide bridges. 30 μl of precursor were prewarmed and then incubated with 570 μl of mitochondrial suspension at 0.5 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml in import buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin) containing 4 mm ATP, 10 mmcreatine phosphate, and 0.15 mg/ml creatine kinase. For the import of precursors with reduced disulfides, the import reaction contained 10 mm DTT. At indicated time points, 50-μl samples were transferred to 100 μl of ice-cold stop buffer (0.6 msorbitol, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 2 μmvalinomycin, 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K). After 10 min, proteinase K was inhibited with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The mitochondria were then reisolated by centrifugation at 7000 ×g and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the amount of imported protein was quantified by electronic autoradiography. Analysis with reducing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE yields the same kinetic parameters. The extent of import was plotted as a percentage of the total amount of precursor in the import reaction, and import kinetics were analyzed using the software package Kaleidagraph (Abelbeck Software) by assuming a simple first-order process and fitting to the equation:A=A0[1−exp(−kt)]+C,where A is the extent of import at any given time (t), A 0 is the extent of import at infinite time, k is the import rate constant, andC is a constant offset attributable to background. Import specifically into the matrix space was measured by rupturing the outer mitochondrial membrane by hypo-osmotic shock (mitoplasting; Ref.27Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) before assaying for import. The efficiency of mitoplasting was determined by quantifying the amount of the intermembrane space protein cytochrome b 2 and the matrix protein α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase present before and after mitoplasting by quantitative Western blotting (28Glick B.S. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mitoplasting ruptured the outer membrane in 95–99% of the sample, whereas the inner mitochondrial membrane remains intact in ∼90% of the sample (data not shown). We constructed a series of mitochondrial precursor proteins in which specific parts of the structure were prevented from unfolding by covalent cross-links. All precursor proteins consisted of a 95-amino acid mitochondrial presequence derived from cytochrome b 2 fused to the ribonuclease barnase (15Matouschek A. Azem A. Ratliff K. Glick B.S. Schmid K. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6727-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 29Hartley R.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 450-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Cross-links were introduced into barnase by mutating pairs of residues to cysteine at positions that allow disulfide bridge formation upon oxidation (Fig. 1). The disulfide bonds covalently link neighboring β-strands within the five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet of barnase and prevent their complete separation during import, because mitochondria have no mechanism for reducing disulfide bridges at their surface (see below and Ref. 14Vestweber D. Schatz G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2037-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Three single disulfide bridge mutants were described previously (22Clarke J. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4322-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and cross-link β-strands 1 and 2 (Cys43-Cys80), β-strands 2 and 3 (Cys70-Cys92), and β-strands 3 and 4 (Cys85-Cys102) (Fig. 1). The structure of these proteins was determined by x-ray crystallography and found to be almost identical to that of wild-type barnase (30Clarke J. Hendrick K. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 493-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To covalently link β-strands 4 and 5, we introduced an additional disulfide bridge by mutating residues 96 and 110 of barnase to cysteines. We constructed precursor proteins containing all single disulfide bridges and all combinations of two and three disulfide bridges between the first four β-strands, as well as a precursor with four disulfide bridges cross-linking all five β-strands. Neighboring Cys residues were induced to form disulfide bridges by oxidation with ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6). Disulfide bond formation was assessed by modification of free thiol groups with SDSM. After oxidation with ferricyanide and purification, none of the disulfide mutants could be modified with SDSM, whereas cysteine mutants that were not oxidized with ferricyanide before treatment with SDSM run slower in SDS-PAGE than ferricyanide-treated precursors (data not shown). Thus, all disulfide bonds form quantitatively after oxidation. Nonreducing SDS-PAGE after oxidation showed that <2% of precursors formed dimers or higher order multimers (data not shown). Two results suggest that precursor proteins are in their native conformation after disulfide bridge formation. First, oxidized precursors are resistant to proteinase K to similar extents as wild-type protein (data not shown). Second, even precursors with eight Cys residues do not form dimers or multimers after oxidation, as judged by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, yet all Cys residues are involved in disulfide bridges. It is unlikely that the Cys residues could efficiently form non-native disulfide bridge pairs within a properly folded precursor protein. We measured the effect of increasing amounts of residual structure in barnase precursor proteins on import into purified yeast mitochondria under conditions where precursor unfolding is not rate limiting for import (15Matouschek A. Azem A. Ratliff K. Glick B.S. Schmid K. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6727-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled precursors were synthesized in vitro by coupled transcription and translation, treated with K3Fe(CN)6 or DTT to form or break disulfide bridges, partially purified, and incubated with purified yeast mitochondria in import buffer. At designated time points samples were removed and analyzed for imported protein (Fig.2 A). The extent of import was plotted as a percentage of the total amount of precursor presented to the mitochondria (Fig. 2, B and C). As precursors were forced to retain an increasing amount of residual structure during import by the cross-linking of β-strands, both the import rate constants and the extent of import decreased (Fig.2 B and Table I, oxidized). Import rates of precursors containing a single disulfide bridge were inhibited by a small but significant amount compared with import rates of precursors lacking disulfide bridges. With introduction of an additional disulfide bridge, import rates were inhibited further. Precursors containing three disulfide bridges (four cross-linked β-strands) were imported approximately four times more slowly than the wild-type precursor. In addition, the extent of import was reduced to ∼50% of that of the precursor lacking disulfide bridges. Finally, precursors containing four disulfide bridges (five cross-linked β-strands) were imported eight to nine times more slowly than the wild-type precursor, and only ∼30% of the cross-linked precursor could be imported. It is not immediately clear why residual structure in a precursor protein reduces the extent of import as well as the rates of import. However, it is commonly observed that the efficiency of import decreases with decreasing import rates. Two possible explanations are that aggregation of partially imported precursors competes with import, and that mitochondrial preparations deteriorate throughout import reactions.Table IRate constants for import into mitochondria and import inhibitions for oxidized and reduced barnase precursor proteinsPrecursorOxidizedaDisulfide bond formation was induced with 10 mm K3Fe(CN)6.ReducedbDisulfide bond reduction with 10 mm DTT.Import rate constantRelative inhibitioncImport rate constant for wild-type precursor divided by import rate constant of precursors containing disulfide bridges.

Open table in a new tab The effect of oxidation on import was not attributable to the formation of precursor dimers or other multimers, because import kinetics analyzed by reducing or nonreducing SDS-PAGE yield identical kinetic parameters. Import of the cross-linked precursors was not attributable to slow reduction of the disulfide bridges, because disulfide bonds remained formed for at least 1 h when oxidized precursors were incubated with de-energized mitochondria in import buffer (data not shown). Import experiments conducted at 30 °C yielded import inhibitions equivalent to those performed at 20 °C. The import inhibition of the oxidized precursors containing Cys residues is caused by the formation of disulfide bridges and not the presence of Cys residues themselves. 10 mm DTT fully reduces the previously characterized single disulfide barnase mutants (22Clarke J. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4322-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). When import experiments were conducted in the presence of 10 mm DTT, all of the disulfide mutants showed import rates approximately equal to those of the wild-type precursor (Table I and Fig. 2 C). The nondisulfide bridge containing wild-type precursor was imported at identical rates under oxidizing or reducing conditions (Table I and Fig. 2 C). Disulfide bridges may affect the stability of the fully folded precursor protein against global unfolding (22Clarke J. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4322-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and therefore, their effect on import rates could be caused by an effect on the stability of the native precursor rather than residual structure induced in the unfolded precursor. We have shown previously that import of barnase and dihydrofolate reductase precursors with the 95-amino acid presequence described here is not limited by unfolding of the passenger protein (15Matouschek A. Azem A. Ratliff K. Glick B.S. Schmid K. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6727-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). When the length of the targeting sequence is reduced to 35 amino acids, unfolding of the passenger protein at the mitochondrial surface becomes rate limiting for import (15Matouschek A. Azem A. Ratliff K. Glick B.S. Schmid K. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6727-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and destabilizing mutations in barnase, such as the mutation of the Ile at position 25 in barnase to Ala, greatly accelerate import (>170-fold rate enhancement of a pseudo-wild-type barnase precursor). 2M. P. Schwartz, S. Huang, and A. Matouschek, unpublished results. The Ile25 → Ala mutation did not accelerate import of any of the disulfide-containing precursors described here (TableII). This demonstrates that, under the conditions tested, global unfolding of the native precursor was never rate limiting for import. Therefore, the observed import rate inhibition is the result of the residual structure induced in the unfolded precursor protein by the disulfide bonds rather than any effect on the stability of the native conformation of barnase.Table IIRate constants for import into mitochondria and accelerations through destabilization for oxidized barnase precursorsPrecursoraDisulfide bond formation was induced with 10 mm K3Fe (CN)6.Import rate constantIle25 → Ala Import rate constantRelative accelerationbImport rate constant for precursor with Ile25 → Ala mutation divided by import rate constant for corresponding precursor lacking the Ile25 → Ala mutation.min−1min−1Wild type2.48 ± 0.08 (n = 3)cn, number of experimental measurements.2.6 ± 0.3 (n = 2)cn, number of experimental measurements.1.0 ± 0.143–802.29 ± 0.01 (n = 2)2.2 ± 0.1 (n = 2)0.97 ± 0.0670–922.0 ± 0.2 (n = 3)2.06 ± 0.06 (n = 2)1.0 ± 0.185–1022.20 ± 0.03 (n = 3)2.20 ± 0.01 (n = 2)1.00 ± 0.0143–8070–921.81 ± 0.01 (n = 3)1.84 ± 0.01 (n = 2)1.02 ± 0.0143–8085–1021.07 ± 0.02 (n = 5)1.00 ± 0.04 (n = 2)0.93 ± 0.0470–9285–1021.60 ± 0.05 (n = 2)1.6 ± 0.1 (n = 2)0.98 ± 0.0943–8070–9285–1020.68 ± 0.05 (n = 5)0.67 ± 0.02 (n = 2)0.99 ± 0.0843–8070–9285–10296–1100.29 ± 0.01 (n = 5)0.31 ± 0.01 (n = 3)1.07 ± 0.05a Disulfide bond formation was induced with 10 mm K3Fe (CN)6.b Import rate constant for precursor with Ile25 → Ala mutation divided by import rate constant for corresponding precursor lacking the Ile25 → Ala mutation.c n, number of experimental measurements. Open table in a new tab Import across both mitochondrial membranes into the matrix can be differentiated from import across only the outer membrane into the intermembrane space by rupturing the outer membrane by hypo-osmotic shock (mitoplasting) before assaying for import. When import of the precursors described here was analyzed by mitoplasting, no significant amounts of precursor could be detected between the two membranes, indicting that all of the precursors were imported completely into the matrix. Import rate constants for wild-type precursor and all the disulfide bridge mutants are shown in Table III together with the relative inhibition of import rates by the disulfide bridges. As for import across the outer membrane, introducing an additional Ile25 → Ala mutation in barnase did not affect inhibition by the disulfide bridges (Table III). Comparison of Tables I and IIIshows that import across the inner membrane appears somewhat slower than import across the outer membrane. Residual structure in the precursor protein has a stronger effect on import across the inner membrane than on import across the outer membrane.Table IIIRate constants for import across the inner mitochondrial membrane, inhibitions by disulfide bridges, and accelerations by destabilizationPrecursorImport rate constantRelative inhibitionaImport rate constant for wild-type precursor divided by import rate constant of precursors containing disulfide bridges.

Disulfide bond formation was induced with 10 mmK3Fe(CN)6. The table also lists the effects of destabilizing cross-linked precursors by the mutation Ile25 → Ala of barnase. To determine the structure of proteins during import, we forced increasing amounts of residual structure into a translocating precursor protein by cross-linking parts of the passenger protein barnase with disulfide bridges. The disulfide bridges cross-linked pairs of neighboring β-strands in the single antiparallel β-sheet of barnase. When two disulfide bridges were introduced simultaneously, they cross-linked either three neighboring β-strands, as in the mutants Cys43-Cys80/Cys70-Cys92and Cys70-Cys92/Cys85-Cys102, or two sets of two β-strands, as in the mutant Cys43-Cys80/Cys85-Cys102(Fig. 1). When three disulfide bridges were introduced simultaneously, they cross-linked four neighboring β-strands, and four disulfide bridges cross-linked all five β-strands of the β-sheet. The largest amount of structure that any one disulfide bridge will stabilize is a pair of neighboring β-strands. However, the cross-linked parts of the protein need not remain in a β-sheet conformation during translocation but could rearrange to minimize steric bulk if the import channel imposed size constraints on the precursor. Tables I and III show that even single disulfide bridges inhibited import and that the inhibition becomes stronger as more β-strands are cross-linked to each other. Therefore, the entire β-sheet in barnase is clearly not normally maintained during import and barnase precursors are not in the molten globule state. Furthermore, because even one and two disulfide bridges inhibited import, we conclude that barnase is normally fully unfolded during import into mitochondria. The differential effects of the three combinations of two disulfide bridges we examined can be understood if one considers that precursors are imported from the N terminus to the C terminus. A single disulfide bridge in a precursor will introduce a loop and thus change the direction of the peptide chain. Therefore, if the directionality of import from N to C terminus is to be maintained, three strands of the precursor must pass through the import machinery at the same time. In the mutants Cys43-Cys80/Cys70-Cys92and Cys70-Cys92/Cys85-Cys102the second disulfide bridge cross-links the neighboring strand to the loop induced by the first disulfide bridge (Fig. 1). This second cross-link restricts the conformations allowed to all three neighboring strands and leads to a small increase in inhibition of import over that induced by a single disulfide bridge. In contrast, in the mutant Cys43-Cys80/Cys85-Cys102two pairs of two neighboring β-strands are cross-linked, presumably forcing four or five strands of protein to be imported next to each other simultaneously. As expected, this double disulfide bridge mutant shows a larger inhibition of import than the two double disulfide bridge mutants with cross-links between three neighboring β-strands. In the triple and quadruple disulfide bridge mutants, the conformation of the five protein strands during translocation is increasingly restricted, which leads to a correspondingly stronger inhibition of import. The structure of proteins during import will be influenced by the internal diameter of the mitochondrial protein import channel. Small amounts of residual structure in precursor proteins, as induced by single disulfide bridges, slow import, but even precursors with large amounts of residual structure, as induced by several disulfide bridges, are imported. Import is progressively inhibited as the residual structure in precursors increases. Thus, the import channels do not show a clear size cutoff. Rather, they appear to be flexible and can accommodate structures considerably larger than a single strand of protein when required. However, the alternative explanation that mitochondria contain a range of import channels of different sizes cannot be ruled out. Because import across the inner membrane is slower than across the outer membrane, and disulfide bridges inhibit import across the inner membrane more strongly than across the outer membrane, the import channel in the inner membrane appears to be tighter than that in the outer membrane. The flexibility of the import channel may be biologically important. Mitochondria establish an electrochemical gradient across their inner membrane. Channels with large openings would make maintaining an electrochemical potential difficult. At the same time, the import channel may need to accommodate large structures. For example, some mitochondrial tRNAs are imported into mitochondria from the cytosol by the protein import machinery, and it has been suggested that they may be imported in association with their cognate aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (31Tarassov I. Entelis N. Martin R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The task of maintaining ion gradients across the membrane would be facilitated by the import channel in the inner membrane having a small diameter and adjusting its size to expand around large structures that pass through it. How do our conclusions apply to proteins other than barnase? Conclusions about the import channel itself, such as its size and flexibility, can be expected to be valid generally, because barnase was used simply as a probe to determine properties intrinsic to the channel. Conclusions about the structure of precursor proteins during import may or may not be general, depending on how good a model barnase is for the behavior of other proteins. The folding and unfolding of barnase have been studied extensively in vitro and appear typical when compared with the behavior of other proteins. Our results suggest that the structure of proteins during import is influenced by the properties of the channel. Size limitations imposed by the internal diameter of the import channel appear to favor minimal residual structure in precursors. Could α-helical structures persist in a precursor protein during import? The anhydrous diameter of an α-helix is 10–12 Å, and that of three extended protein strands is between 10 and 20 Å, depending on their arrangement. Therefore, our data cannot rule out that α-helices are maintained in a protein during import. However, this appears unlikely, because α-helices are unstable outside the context of other structural elements, and our results suggest that the structure of the import channel minimizes residual structure in precursors.

https://openalex.org/W2082059595,"Ectopic expression of the α5 integrin subunit in cancer cells with little or no endogenous expression of this integrin often results in reduced proliferation as well as reduced malignancy. We now show that inhibition resulting from ectopic expression of α5integrin is due to induction of autocrine negative transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) activity. MCF-7 breast cancer cells do not express either α5 integrin or type II TGF-β receptor and hence are unable to generate TGF-β signal transduction. Ectopic expression of α5integrin expression enhanced cell adhesion to fibronectin, reduced proliferation, and increased the expression of type II TGF-β receptor mRNA and cell surface protein. Receptor expression was increased to a higher level in α5transfectants by growth on fibronectin-coated plates. Induction of type II TGF-β receptor expression also resulted in the generation of autocrine negative TGF-β activity because colony formation was increased after TGF-β neutralizing antibody treatment. Transient transfection with a TGF-β promoter response element in tandem with a luciferase cDNA into cells stably transfected with α5integrin resulted in basal promoter activities 5–10-fold higher than those of control cells. Moreover, when α5 transfectants were treated with a neutralizing antibody to either TGF-β or integrin α5, this increased basal promoter activity was blocked. Autocrine TGF-β activity also induced 3-fold higher endogenous fibronectin expression in α5 transfectants relative to that of control cells. Re-expression of type II receptor by α5 transfection also restored the ability of the cells to respond to exogenous TGF-β and led to reduced tumor growth in athymic nude mice. Taken together, these results show for the first time that TGF-β type II receptor expression can be controlled by α5β1 ligation and integrin signal transduction. Moreover, TGF-β and integrin signal transduction appear to cooperate in their tumor-suppressive functions.

Moreover, TGF-β and integrin signal transduction appear to cooperate in their tumor-suppressive functions. As mediators of cell matrix-cell interaction, integrins impart diverse biological properties to the cells that express them. A number of studies have demonstrated that integrin expression affects tumor cell proliferation and progression (1Ruoslahti E. J. Clin.

Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the expression of integrins is altered in human tumors compared with corresponding normal cells.

Overexpression of certain integrins, such as α5β1, can reverse tumorigenicity and anchorage-independent growth in some transformed cells (10Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E.

Perturbation of integrin α5β1binding to its ligand stimulates the growth of a variant of the K562 cells (12Symington B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25744-25747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we showed expression of integrin α5subunit selectively blocks DNA synthesis (13Wang D.-H. Birkenmeier T.M. Yang J. Venkateswarlu S. Humphrey L. Brattain M.G. Sun L.-Z. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and disruption of α5β1ligation enhanced DNA synthesis in a mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent but epidermal growth factor receptor-independent manner (14Gong J.G.

Extracellular matrix recognition by integrin α5β1 may, therefore, play a role in the negative control of cell growth, which may be lost in some cancer cells.Loss of negative growth factors can also lead to abnormal growth in transformed cells.

Loss of TGF-β sensitivity in estrogen receptor + breast cancer cells has frequently been associated with loss of the TGF-β type II receptor (RII), which, along with the TGF-β type I receptor (RI), is necessary for TGF-β signal transduction (20Kalkhoven E. Roelen B.A.J. deWinter J.P. Mummery C.L. van den Eijnden-van Ranij A.J.M. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1157-1161Google Scholar, 21Sun L.-Z. Wu G. Willson J.K.V.

The importance of loss of TGF-β signaling in breast cancer cells was demonstrated by differences in tumorigenicity of MCF-7 breast cancer clones with and without RII expression (22Ko Y. Banerji S.S. Liu Y. Li W. Liang J. Soule H.D. Pauley R.J. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Brattain M.G. J. Cell Physiol. 1998; 176: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and the ability of re-expression of RII in MCF-7 cells to inhibit tumorigenicity in athymic mice (21Sun L.-Z. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajkarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X.-F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RII has been shown to be a tumor suppressor gene by the criteria that its mutational inactivation is associated with a hereditary form of colon cancer and that RII ectopic expression in cancer cells from individuals with this form of cancer reverses malignancy in athymic mice (24Markowitz S.D. Wang J. Myeroff L. Parsons R. Sun L.-Z. Lutterbaugh J. Fan R.S. Zborowska E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Brattain M.G. Willson J.K.V.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22044-22049Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Re-expression of RI in cancer cells that are deficient in this receptor also reverses tumorigenicity (26Wang J. Han W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17366-17371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).Two lines of evidence indicate that autocrine negative TGF-β may be more important than response to exogenous TGF-β in controlling tumor growth. The first of these was the demonstration that removal of autocrine TGF-β activity by stable transfection of a TGF-β antisense expression vector leads to malignant progression of cancer cells in athymic mice (27Wu S.P. Sun L.-Z. Willson J.K.V. Humphrey L. Kerbel R. Brattain M.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 115-123PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wu S.P. Theodorescu D. Kerbel R.S. Willson J.K.V. Mulder K.M. Humphrey L.E. Brattain M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This approach blocked autocrine TGF-β activity because endogenous TGF-β was removed from these cells but did not affect the expression of TGF-β receptors and, therefore, permitted the retention of response to exogenously produced TGF-β in the tumor environment from nonmalignant cells. The occurrence of tumor formation indicated that exogenous TGF-β produced by nonmalignant cells was insufficient to achieve tumor suppression. The second line of evidence involved the re-expression of RII in a cell line that was homozygous for mutational inactivation of the gene. Re-expression of RII regenerated autocrine negative TGF-β but did not regenerate an inhibitory response to exogenous TGF-β (25Wang J. Sun L.-Z. Myeroff L. Wang X. Gentry L.E. Yang J. Liang J. Zborowska E. Markowitz S. Willson J.K.V. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22044-22049Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). However, reversion of tumorigenicity did occur, indicating that autocrine TGF-β was critical. Thus, the available evidence indicates that mechanisms for regeneration of RII expression and autocrine negative TGF-β will be of importance in our understanding of controls of TGF-β signal transduction in malignancy and may lead to novel treatment or prevention approaches for cancer.Previously, we showed that vitamin D3 was inhibitory to wild type MCF-7 clones that expressed RII and to RII-null clones expressing ectopic RII (29Wu G. Fan R.S. Li W. Srinivas V. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7749-7756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast, RII-null clones were refractory to inhibition (29Wu G. Fan R.S. Li W. Srinivas V. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7749-7756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Response to vitamin D3 was associated with induction of higher RII levels and enhanced TGF-β autocrine negative activity, suggesting that other growth modulators may cause inhibition by inducing TGF-β autocrine negative activity. Given the ability of α5 integrin to affect growth in a negative fashion (13Wang D.-H. Birkenmeier T.M. Yang J. Venkateswarlu S. Humphrey L. Brattain M.G. Sun L.-Z. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 14Gong J.G. Ko T.C. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1662-1669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that re-expression of cell surface α5β1 integrin in cancer cells deficient in the expression of the α5 subunit would lead to regeneration of RII expression and autocrine negative TGF-β activity. This hypothesis was tested by stable transfection of a MCF-7 breast cancer clone lacking both RII and α5 integrin expression with an α5 integrin cDNA. Transfection resulted in re-expression of RII and regeneration of autocrine TGF-β activity, as well as response to exogenous TGF-β. RII expression and TGF-β responses were dependent upon α5β1ligation to endogenous MCF-7 fibronectin (FN) and were enhanced when exogenous FN was used to coat culture plates, indicating that growth inhibition by α5β1 ligation involves induction of autocrine TGF-β activity.DISCUSSIONA number of studies have indicated that loss or reduced expression of integrin receptors results in abnormal cell growth (10Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 11Symington B.E.

To test the hypothesis that α5β1 ligation has tumor suppressor effects mediated through autocrine TGF-β, we restored integrin α5 expression in MCF-7 cells. The MCF-7 cell line provided a good model system for this study in that it expressed low amounts of α5 integrin and was insensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β1 due to repression of RII expression (21Sun L.-Z.

Integrin α5transfectants expressed similar levels of cell surface integrin as Hs578T cells, another breast cancer cell line that was sensitive to growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β1. 2D. Wang and M. Brattain, unpublished results. The α5 transfection resulted in an increase in expression of RII, which was accompanied by increased autocrine TGF-β activity as assessed by 1) enhanced clonality following TGF-β neutralizing antibody treatment; 2) decreased endogenous activity of a TGF-β-sensitive reporter system in response to TGF-β neutralizing antibody treatment with either TGF-β1 or α5antibodies; and 3) stimulation of FN expression, which was reversed by TGF-β neutralizing antibody treatment. Up-regulation of RII expression was also reflected by increased sensitivity to inhibition by treatment with exogenous TGF-β.Previously, we showed that blockade of FN/α5β1 ligation by antibodies against FN or integrin α5 subunit stimulated DNA synthesis in cancer cell lines with moderate to high α5β1 cell surface expression (13Wang D.-H.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1662-1669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with a previously described model that suggests that moderate adhesion to a loosely organized extracellular matrix facilitated both migration and growth, but strong adhesion to a fully organized extracellular matrix suppressed proliferation and contributed to inhibition of growth (4Giancotti F.G. Mainiero F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 47-64PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the low level of expression of integrin α5β1 on the cell surface of wild type MCF-7 cells could contribute to weak adhesion and hence abnormal growth in MCF-7 cells. Ectopic α5 expression leads to results consistent with a model suggesting that higher α5β1 surface expression allows for greater adhesion due not only to α5, but to greater endogenous FN expression as well. Inhibition of proliferation is either due to or augmented by the generation of autocrine TGF-β activity. Exogenous FN coating allows for even stronger adhesion and further enhancement of autocrine TGF-β activity. Most importantly, the results indicate that α5β1 ligation and autocrine TGF-β interact in a reciprocal manner that is self-sustaining for both autocrine negative activity and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Moreover, this interaction is tumor-suppressive. This model may well apply to other systems given that autocrine TGF-β signaling and α5β1 ligation have both been individually associated with tumor suppression in various model systems. Autocrine TGF-β has been shown to control steady state α5expression (32Wang D.H. Zhou G. Birkenmeier T.M. Gong J. Sun L.-Z. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14154-14159Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) in model systems that also show tumor-suppressive TGF-β function (28Wu S.P. Theodorescu D. Kerbel R.S. Willson J.K.V. Mulder K.M. Humphrey L.E. Brattain M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).Our results suggest that α5β1 may have a negative growth regulatory role in some cancer cells and normal cells through modulation of TGF-β sensitivity. Apparently, signal transduction mechanisms for activating the TGF-β pathway are essentially intact in MCF-7 cells because restoration of α5β1 expression leads to autocrine as well as exogneous TGF-β inhibitory responses. However, other types of cancer cells may be resistant to this mode of regulation despite α5β1 expression because of perturbations of the TGF-β pathway resulting from malignant transformation. For example, HCT116 colon carcinoma cells express high levels of integrins that mediate adhesion to FN, but this cell line still exhibits a highly malignant phenotype due to a mutated RII gene (25Wang J. Sun L.-Z. Myeroff L. Wang X. Gentry L.E. Yang J. Liang J. Zborowska E. Markowitz S. Willson J.K.V. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22044-22049Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). It is also possible that downstream signaling messengers encoded by oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes that participate in either a primary or secondary manner in signal transduction are abnormally modulated in some cell types.An interesting aspect of this study was the enhancement of RII expression and TGF-β function when α5 transfectants were plated on FN-coated plates. These results, along with the demonstration that α5 antibody treatment blocks autocrine TGF-β activity, show that α5β1 ligation to FN is critical to the generation of RII expression and hence TGF-β-mediated signal transduction. Enhanced basal expression of FN in MCF-7 α5 transfectants that were not grown on FN-coated plates was also observed. We postulate that increased steady state expression of FN after α5 transfection allowed for α5β1 ligation, which was critical to the basal RII expression and TGF-β sensitivity associated with transfectant cells that were not exposed to FN-coated plates.In a previous study, we reported that disruption of α5β1/FN ligation resulted in stimulation of DNA synthesis (14Gong J.G. Ko T.C. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1662-1669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis was associated with up-regulated CDK2 activity without alterations of CDK inhibitors. DNA synthesis was also found to be dependent upon extracellular receptor kinase 1 and 2 activation. Thus, this previous study indicated α5β1 ligation to FN had a repressive effect on cell cycle progression through repression of cyclin A and CDK2 expression. Exogenous treatment with TGF-β has been shown to down-regulate cyclin A (39Feng X.-H. Filvardt E.H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24237-24245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TGF-β has also been reported to repress ERK1/2 activation in some types of cells (40Lee M. Huang C. Lee J. Slavkin H. Warburton D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L374-L381PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that DNA synthesis resulting from disruption of α5β1 ligation may be a reflection of the disruption of integrin related autocrine TGF-β activity resulting in up-regulation of ERK activation and subsequent promotion of cell cycle transit.There is evidence that integrins transduce signals cooperatively with other growth factor systems in the regulation of cell proliferation. The proliferative response of murine mammary carcinoma cells to platelet-derived growth factor-BB and basic fibroblast growth factor is dependent on the extracellular matrix environment, indicating that modification of extracellular matrix and/or surface integrin receptors may regulate responsiveness to these growth factors (41Elliott B. Ostman A. Westermark B. Rubin K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Reciprocal enhancement of α5β1-mediated adhesion by insulin and of insulin-mediated signal transduction by α5β1 have recently been reported (42Guilherme A. Torres K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22899-22903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, α5β1 ligation does not appear to modulate expression of insulin receptor in this system. Our results indicate that the TGF-β signaling pathway can be rescued by re-expression of integrin in MCF-7 cells. Ligation of integrins with their extracellular matrix ligands has been shown to regulate gene expression in a number of studies (43Jones P.L. Schmidhauser C. Bissell M.J. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 137-154PubMed Google Scholar). However, because studies on the regulation of RII mRNA transcription and stability are limited, it is not yet clear how ligation of α5β1integrin to FN increases RII mRNA level. Nevertheless, the induction of RII and autocrine TGF-β activity by α5β1 ligation suggests that integrin-mediated signal transduction plays a cooperative role with TGF-β signal transduction in tumor suppression. Moreover, the results indicating reciprocal positive control of autocrine TGF-β and α5β1 ligation suggest that TGF-β signal transduction and α5β1 integrin signal transduction participate in a mutually self-sustaining tumor-suppressive autocrine loop. As mediators of cell matrix-cell interaction, integrins impart diverse biological properties to the cells that express them. A number of studies have demonstrated that integrin expression affects tumor cell proliferation and progression (1Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar, 2Damsky C.H. Werb Z. Curr. Opin.

Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the expression of integrins is altered in human tumors compared with corresponding normal cells. Many neoplastic cells show reduced expression of integrins (4Giancotti F.G. Mainiero F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 47-64PubMed Google Scholar, 5Natali P.G. Nicotra M.R. Botti C. Mottolese M.

Cancer. 1992; 52: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Overexpression of certain integrins, such as α5β1, can reverse tumorigenicity and anchorage-independent growth in some transformed cells (10Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 11Symington B.E. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Perturbation of integrin α5β1binding to its ligand stimulates the growth of a variant of the K562 cells (12Symington B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25744-25747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we showed expression of integrin α5subunit selectively blocks DNA synthesis (13Wang D.-H. Birkenmeier T.M. Yang J. Venkateswarlu S. Humphrey L. Brattain M.G. Sun L.-Z. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and disruption of α5β1ligation enhanced DNA synthesis in a mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent but epidermal growth factor receptor-independent manner (14Gong J.G. Ko T.C. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1662-1669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Extracellular matrix recognition by integrin α5β1 may, therefore, play a role in the negative control of cell growth, which may be lost in some cancer cells. Loss of negative growth factors can also lead to abnormal growth in transformed cells.

Loss of TGF-β sensitivity in estrogen receptor + breast cancer cells has frequently been associated with loss of the TGF-β type II receptor (RII), which, along with the TGF-β type I receptor (RI), is necessary for TGF-β signal transduction (20Kalkhoven E.

https://openalex.org/W1982779531,"Mouse transporter protein (MTP) is a highly conserved polytopic membrane protein present in mammalian lysosomes and endosomes. The role of MTP in regulating the in vivosubcellular distribution of numerous structurally distinct small molecules has been examined in this study by its expression in a drug-sensitive strain of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Surprisingly, the expression of MTP in membranes of an intracellular compartment resulted in a cellular resistance or hypersensitivity to a range of drugs that included nucleoside and nucleobase analogs, antibiotics, anthracyclines, ionophores, and steroid hormones. The intracellular bioavailability of steroid hormones was altered by MTP, as determined using an in vivoglucocorticoid receptor-driven reporter assay in yeast, suggesting that the MTP-regulated drug sensitivity arose due to a change in the subcellular compartmentalization of steroid hormones and other drugs. MTP-regulated drug sensitivity in yeast was blocked to varying degrees by compounds that inhibit lysosomal function, interfere with intracellular cholesterol transport, or modulate the multidrug resistance phenotype of mammalian cells. These results indicate that MTP is involved in the subcellular compartmentalization of diverse hydrophobic small molecules and contributes to the inherent drug sensitivity or resistance of the mammalian cell.

These results indicate that MTP is involved in the subcellular compartmentalization of diverse hydrophobic small molecules and contributes to the inherent drug sensitivity or resistance of the mammalian cell. The mammalian cell is exquisitely compartmentalized into organelles, distinct vesicle populations, cytoplasm, and the extracellular space. Metabolic and catabolic processes present within each of these compartments require the presence of one or more different types of small molecules. Therefore, the transport and/or retention of these small molecules between these subcellular compartments must be tightly regulated to maintain the integrity of these cellular processes. The lipid membrane architecture of cellular organelles, vesicles, and the plasma membrane dictates that the compartmentalization of small hydrophilic molecules occur by protein-mediated transport processes. Many transporters of hydrophilic molecules, such as amino acids (1Malandro M.S. Kilberg M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 305-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), hexoses (2Thorens B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G541-G553PubMed Google Scholar), and nucleosides (3Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 153-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), have been identified in the plasma membrane. Membrane proteins that mediate the flux of nucleotide, nucleotide sugars, and nucleotide sulfate into the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (4Berinsone P. Hirschberg C.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 842: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), amino acid neurotransmitters and biogenic amines into storage vesicles (1Malandro M.S. Kilberg M.S. Annu. Rev.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) have also been identified and characterized. In contrast, mechanisms or transport processes responsible for regulating a subcellular compartmentalization of small hydrophobic molecules, which can readily permeate lipid membranes, are not as well understood. Plasma membrane transporters of this type include the multidrug efflux pump P-glycoprotein (7Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev.

P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance-associated protein found to be present within intracellular compartments presumably provide a similar function to their plasma membrane counterparts (8Kavallaris M.

Mouse transporter protein (MTP) 1The abbreviations used are: MTP, mouse transporter protein; β-gal, β-galactosidase; CCCP, carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenyl-hydrazone; MDR, multidrug-resistant; TPP, tetraphenylphosphonium; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid1The abbreviations used are: MTP, mouse transporter protein; β-gal, β-galactosidase; CCCP, carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenyl-hydrazone; MDR, multidrug-resistant; TPP, tetraphenylphosphonium; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidis a murine 4-transmembrane spanning protein present in lysosomes and late endosomes (14Cabrita M.A. Hobman T.C.

Cass, personal communication. and its transcript (or that of its mammalian homologs) is expressed in most, if not all, tissues and cell types (15Hogue D.L. Ellison M.J. Young J.D. Cass C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9801-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). 3D. Hogue, unpublished results.3D. Hogue, unpublished results. MTP exhibits 98% identity with its human homolog and thus represents a highly conserved mammalian protein. It is 233 amino acids in length and possesses a hydrophilic C terminus containing several tyrosine-based sorting motifs (YXX*, where * represents a bulky hydrophobic residue) that have been demonstrated, in other membrane proteins, to be responsible for localization to intracellular compartments (16Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacio J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). A phenotypic selection assay using Saccharomyces cerevisiae originally identified a truncated MTP that could mediate a cellular uptake of thymidine by its inappropriate expression at the plasma membrane (15Hogue D.L. Ellison M.J. Young J.D. Cass C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9801-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Based upon this observation, MTP was predicted to be involved in the subcellular compartmentalization of nucleosides. We are interested in defining further the functional role of MTP in the subcellular compartmentalization of various types of small molecules within the mammalian cell. However, it is exceedingly difficult to examine the in vivo distribution of small molecules in mammalian cells, the exception being those molecules that are intrinsically fluorescent, such as anthracyclines (17Hurwitz S.J. Terashima M. Mizunuma N. Slapak C.A. Blood. 1997; 10: 3745-3754Crossref Google Scholar). The yeastS. cerevisiae has previously been used as a heterologous expression system to study the function of MTP (15Hogue D.L. Ellison M.J. Young J.D. Cass C.E. J. Biol.

Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21028-21034Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), Golgi nucleotide-galactose transporters (19Sun-Wada G.H. Yoshioka S. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J.

On this basis, we have utilized a sensitive in vivo reporter system that employs a drug-sensitive strain ofS. cerevisiae to study the physiological role of MTP in regulating the subcellular distribution of small molecules (22Egner R. Rosenthal F.E. Kralli A. Sanglard D. Kuchler K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 523-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). TheS. cerevisiae protein data base contains no proteins that exhibit any significant identity with MTP; therefore, interference by a yeast ortholog of MTP would not be expected.3 The drug-sensitive yeast strain lacks the plasma membrane proteins Pdr5 and Snq2, which are ATP-binding cassette transporters that mediate a cellular resistance to a wide variety of structurally diverse drugs by acting as drug efflux pumps (23Servos J.

The absence of these two transporters allows for the accumulation of toxic concentrations of drug within the cell that ultimately leads to cell death. Should the expression of MTP in this yeast regulate the distribution of these toxic drugs between subcellular compartments, a subcellular sequestration and altered cytotoxicity of the drug may arise. Evidence to support a functional role for MTP in regulation of the subcellular distribution of several structurally distinct small molecules (or their metabolites) is presented. The open reading frame of MTP was amplified from pMTP (15Hogue D.L. Ellison M.J. Young J.D. Cass C.E. J. Biol.

The polymerase chain reaction product was subjected to Taq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing using an Applied Biosystems model 310 DNA sequencer. The open reading frame of MTP was subcloned into the yeast expression vector pYPGE15 to generate pYP-MTP. The pYPGE15 vector, a gift from Joe Brunelli (Washington State University), contains a URA3 auxotrophic marker, 2 μm origin, a constitutive phosphoglycerate kinase promotor, and a CYC1 transcriptional terminator. The yeast strains YYM4 (MATaura3–52 leu2-Δ1 his3-Δ200 ade2–101oclys2–801amb Δpdr5::TRP1 Δsnq2::hisG)and YPH499 (MATaura3–52 leu2-Δ1 his3-Δ200 ade2–101oclys2–801amb trp1-Δ63)were kindly provided by Karl Kuchler (University and Biocenter of Vienna). Yeast strain YNK410 (MATa ura3–52 leu2-Δ1 his3-Δ200 ade2–101oc lys2–801amb trp1-Δ63 Δpdr5::GT3Z)was obtained from Anastasia Kralli (Biozentrum, University of Basel). Yeast strains were grown at 30 °C on YPD or selective media that contained auxotrophic supplements for plasmid maintenance as described by Kaiser et al. (29Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Yeast was grown in selective medium to an A 600 of 1.0 and diluted 5-fold into 500 ml of YPD. The culture was grown to anA 600 of 1.0, whereupon sodium azide was added (final concentration, 10 mm) and culture was chilled in ice water. Cells were collected by centrifugation (4000 ×g for 10 min) and suspended in 10 ml of SB-Zymolyase (1.4m sorbitol, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mm sodium azide, 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.3 mg/ml Zymolyase 100T) and incubated at 30 °C for 40 min. Spheroplasts were pellet by centrifugation (700 × gfor 10 min) and suspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (0.8 msorbitol, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm EGTA) that contained Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Spheroplasts were lysed by Dounce homogenization, and homogenate was subjected to centrifugation (2500 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) to pellet unbroken cells. The supernatant was collected, and 1-ml portions of the homogenate were layered onto a discontinuous gradient composed of 1 ml each of 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, and 60% (w/v) sucrose in lysis buffer. Gradients were centrifuged (100,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C), and 1-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradient. Total cellular membranes were collected by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C) of the Dounce homogenate. The sensitivity of yeast to different chemical compounds was initially screened using a paper disc assay. Yeast was grown in appropriate selective medium and plated (0.15A 600 units) in top agar (0.7% agarose in selective medium) onto selective medium-agar plates. A 5-μl aliquot of drug dissolved in either ethanol or Me2SO was spotted onto a paper disc (Whatman no. 5, 7 mm diameter), which was then laid on the top agar. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3 days and examined for cleared zones of growth inhibition. Ethanol or Me2SO alone spotted onto paper discs did not inhibit growth. A quantitative drug sensitivity assay was performed using a method similar to that of Egner et al. (22Egner R. Rosenthal F.E. Kralli A. Sanglard D. Kuchler K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 523-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Various concentrations of drug prepared in 55 °C selective medium-agar were plated in triplicate into 24-well plates. Actively growing cultures of cells were diluted to A 600 values of 0.12, 0.012, and 0.0012, and then 10-μl aliquots of each dilution were spotted in triplicate onto drug-containing medium. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. A quantitative measure of the drugs effect was determined based upon the concentration of drug that inhibited colony formation by 50% (IC50 value). Modulator studies were performed as above except using a single concentration of drug in the absence or presence of modulating drug. Assays were performed using the yeast strain YNK410, which harbors the genomically integrated reporter gene GT3Z (22Egner R. Rosenthal F.E. Kralli A. Sanglard D. Kuchler K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 523-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which had been transformed with the glucocorticoid receptor expression plasmid pRS314-GN795 (30Lefstin J.A. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 8: 2842-2856Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and either pYPGE15 or pYP-MTP. Cell cultures were grown overnight at 30 °C in selective media, diluted 1:10 into fresh selective media that contained dexamethasone, progesterone, or ethanol (carrier), and then grown for 14 h. Hormone-induced expression of β-galactosidase (β-gal) in cell lysates was measured using a glass bead lysis/o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactosidase assay method (29Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated after identical periods of incubation, and A 420 was measured. Protein content of cell lysates was determined, and specific activity of β-gal in cell lysate was expressed as nmol/min/mg of protein. Yeast protein samples were denatured in 4 m urea prior to being subjected to electrophoretic separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Membranes were sequentially incubated with primary antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunologicals) as described previously (15Hogue D.L. Ellison M.J. Young J.D. Cass C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9801-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rabbit antiserum used was specific for DPAP A (Tom Stevens, University of Oregon), Pep12p (Scott Emr, University of California, San Diego, CA), Vma4p (Daniel Klionsky, University of California, Davis, CA), Pma1(Andre Goffeau, Universite Catholique de Louvain), Sec61p (Randy Schekman, University of California, Berkeley, CA), and MTP (15Hogue D.L.

The open reading frame of the MTP cDNA was cloned into a high copy yeast expression vector, and its expression in YYM4 cells was examined by immunoblotting analysis. MTP was present as a low abundance protein in the membranes of cells transformed with the MTP-containing vector, but was not detected in cells transformed with the parental pYPGE15 vector (Fig.1 A). The cellular location of MTP in yeast was assessed by immunoblot analysis of subcellular fractions isolated by means of discontinous sucrose gradient centrifugation (Fig. 1 B). MTP appeared to colocalize to fractions most tightly associated with antibody markers for Golgi (DPAP A) and prevacuolar vesicles (Pep12p), but not with those for plasma membrane (Pma1), endoplasmic reticulum (Sec61p), and vacuole (Vma4p). These results indicated that the localization of MTP was restricted to intracellular membranes, most probably those of Golgi or Golgi-derived vesicles and/or the endosome-like prevacuolar vesicles (31Vida T.A. Huyer G. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). MTP-expressing yeast were initially screened for sensitivity to a variety of compounds using a paper disc assay. Drug sensitivity, relative to control YYM4 yeast, was assigned based on the diameter of the zone of growth inhibition (Fig. 2). The expression of MTP in YYM4 yeast conferred increased resistance or a hypersensitivity to a range of compounds that included antibiotics, anthracyclines, neutral and carboxylic ionophores, nucleoside and nucleobase analogs, steriod hormones, dihydropyridines, phenothiazines, and cationic lipophilic molecules (Table I). MTP-expressing yeast did not exhibit altered sensitivity toward cyclohexamide, vancomycin, tamoxifen, or cisplatin, as compared with control yeast. The parental strain, YPH499, exhibited none or little sensitivity to any of the compounds examined (not shown).Table IEffect of expression of MTP on the drug sensitivity of YYM4 yeastResistance8-Aza-adenineDoxorubicinDaunorubicinErythromycinMonensinCCCPNicardipineNigericinValinomycinProgesteroneβ-EstradiolRhodamine 123Hypersensitivity5-F-uracil5-F-uridineCamptothecinEthidium bromideTrifluoperazineTPP bromideNo change inCyclohexamideVancomycinTamoxifensensitivityTaurocholateCisplatinYYM4 yeast transformed with pYPGE15 or pYP-MTP was subjected to paper disc drug assays. Zones of growth inhibition for each drug were compared to pYPGE15-transformed yeast.

Open table in a new tab YYM4 yeast transformed with pYPGE15 or pYP-MTP was subjected to paper disc drug assays. Zones of growth inhibition for each drug were compared to pYPGE15-transformed yeast. Hypersensitivity led to increased diameters of zones, resistance led to decreased diameters, and no change resulted in identical diameters. The degree of cellular drug resistance or sensitivity conferred by the expression of MTP toward a number of compounds was quantitated using a colony formation assay, an example of which is presented in Fig.3. The concentrations required to inhibit colony formation by 50% (IC50) determined for control and MTP-expressing yeast are shown in TableII. MTP conferred an increased resistance of approximately 1.5–15-fold to drugs that included carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenyl-hydrazone (CCCP), nicardipine, erythromycin, progesterone, and rhodamine 123. Conversely, MTP-expressing yeast was 2–50-fold more sensitive than control cells to trifluoperazine, TPP bromide, 5-fluorouracil, and 5-fluorouridine. The expression of MTP within the membranes of the Golgi and/or prevacuolar compartments could significantly modify the cytotoxicity of many structurally distinct drugs, suggesting that this effect occurred via a change in the subcellular distribution and subsequent intracellular bioavailability of these drugs.Table IIQuantitation of the MTP-mediated resistance/hypersensitivity in YYM4 yeastIC50 for colony formationControlMTPμmCCCP614.5Nicardipine2001500Trifluoperazine1200670TPP bromide17570Erythromycin3004700Rhodamine 1231001505-fluorouracil10.25-fluorouridine2505Progesterone<50>500aTo limit of solubility.YYM4 yeast transformed with pYPGE15 or pYP-MTP were subjected to the quantitative plating assay using graded concentrations of each drug.

Open table in a new tab YYM4 yeast transformed with pYPGE15 or pYP-MTP were subjected to the quantitative plating assay using graded concentrations of each drug. The IC50 is indicated. The profile of drug resistance mediated by MTP exhibited a striking similarity to that exhibited by multidrug-resistant (MDR) mammalian cells that overexpress the P-glycoprotein (also termed MDR1). P-glycoprotein is a ATP-binding cassette transporter that mediates resistance to rhodamines, anthracyclines, steroid hormones, and carboxylic ionophores (7Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar, 32Germann U.A. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32A: 927-944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Cells that overexpress P-glycoprotein also exhibit a collateral sensitivity or hypersensitivity toward various hydrophobic molecules (33Bech-Hansen N.T. Till J.E. Ling V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1976; 88: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar); however, P-glycoprotein does not mediate resistance or hypersensitivity toward 5-fluorouracil or 5-fluorouridine (34Santoni-Rugiu E. Silverman J.A. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 2255-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The MDR phenotype in mammalian cells can be blocked by the presence of one of many different modulators, which are hydrophobic molecules that generally possess a tertiary nitrogen (35Beck W.T. Ozols R.F. Molecular and Clinical Advances in Anticancer Drug Resistance. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1991: 151-170Google Scholar). We assessed the ability of several MDR modulators to block the drug hypersensitivity or resistance mediated by the expression of MTP in YYM4 yeast through the use of the quantitative plating assay, an example of which is shown in Fig. 4. The modulators, which included amiodarone, dipyridamole, reserpine, and verapamil, did not exhibit toxicity to YYM4 yeast at the concentrations utilized (not shown). All modulators completely failed to reverse the hypersensitivity to 5-fluorouridine or the resistance to nicardipine (Table III). Conversely, all modulators completely blocked resistance to progesterone. Resistance to CCCP, erythromycin, and rhodamine 123 was blocked to various degrees by each modulator. These results indicated that these MDR modulators were, to varying extents, able to block MTP-mediated resistance/hypersensitivity. This modulation effect was dependent upon drug-modulator combinations present, a characteristic that is shared with the interaction of these modulators with P-glycoprotein (32Germann U.A. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32A: 927-944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar,35Beck W.T. Ozols R.F. Molecular and Clinical Advances in Anticancer Drug Resistance.

The mechanism by which steroid hormones exert their cytotoxicity in yeast is not known but is thought to be related to their interference in the pathways of biosynthesis or cellular transport of sterols. The yeast ATP-binding cassette transporter Pdr5 can reduce the cellular accumulation of steroid hormones by transporting these molecules into the extracellular space, thereby circumventing their toxic effects (22Egner R. Rosenthal F.E. Kralli A. Sanglard D. Kuchler K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 523-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25Kralli A. Bohen S.P. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25167-25172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Decreased cellular accumulation of steroid hormones mediated by Pdr5 has been directly demonstrated by an in vivo reporter assay in the YNK410 yeast strain (22Egner R. Rosenthal F.E. Kralli A. Sanglard D. Kuchler K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 523-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25Kralli A. Bohen S.P. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4701-4705Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). YNK410 yeast harbors (i) a genomically integrated cassette composed of glucocorticoid response elements upstream of a β-gal reporter gene, and (ii) a disruptedPDR5 gene (the absence of the Pdr5 transporter allows for an intracellular accumulation of steroid hormones). Expression of a glucocorticoid receptor in YNK410 yeast drives transcription of the β-gal reporter gene in a steroid hormone-dependent fashion and therefore provides a direct measurement of the intracellular bioavailability of steroid hormone. MTP was able to mediate a cellular resistance to steroid hormone toxicity; therefore, we used the YNK410 β-gal reporter system to measure whether this resistance was associated with an alteration in the intracellular bioavailability of steroid hormones. Exposure of MTP-expressing cells to 10 μm dexamethasone or progesterone induced approximately 15- and 25-fold greater levels of β-gal activity, respectively, than compared with control cells under identical conditions (Fig.5 A). This effect of dexamethasone and progesterone was dose-dependent, because greater levels of β-gal expression were observed in the presence of MTP than in its absence over a 100-fold concentration"

Besides a putative PTP domain, PTP36 has a band 4.1 homology domain that has been found in various cytoskeletal proteins. The band 4.1 homology domains are responsible for the targeting of such cytoskeletal proteins to the membrane-cytoskeleton interfaces. So far, five mammalian PTPs with the band 4.1 homology domain have been reported. These include PTPH1 (9Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The presence of the band 4.1 homology domain might imply the involvement of these PTPs in the regulation of cytoskeletons and cell adhesion. It was reported that, in COS-7 cells, overexpression of PTPMEG inhibited cell proliferation, reduced the saturation density, and blocked cell growth in soft agar (16Gu M. Meng K. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12980-12985Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that PTPMEG is involved in the signal transduction of the cell adhesion that regulates the cell growth. There is no evidence, however, that PTPMEG has any effect on the cell adhesion signaling pathways. To study the biological functions of PTP36, we established a HeLa cell line in which the overexpression of PTP36 was inducible. PTP36 expressed in HeLa cells was enriched in the cytoskeleton near the plasma membrane. When the overexpression of PTP36 was induced, we observed morphological change (17Ogata M. Takada T. Oh-hora M. Hamaoka T. Yakura H. Kinases and Phosphatases in Lymphocyte and Neuronal Signaling. Springer-Verlag, Tokyo, 1997: 322Google Scholar), reduced cell growth and cell adhesion, decreases in actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, and reduced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) induced by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Our results suggest that PTP36 is involved in the regulation of cytoskeletons, cell adhesion, and cell growth. Enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), Promega (Madison, WI), and Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Anti-actin (AC-40, mouse IgG2a), anti-vimentin (V9, mouse IgG1), anti-vinculin (hVIN-1, mouse IgG1), phalloidin-tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (P1951), doxycycline (D-9891), puromycin (P-7255), and lysophosphatidic acid (L-7260) were purchased from Sigma. Anti-FAK (06-367, rabbit polyclonal IgG), anti-α-tubulin (DM1A, mouse IgG1), and PY20 (mouse IgG2b) were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), Cedarlane Laboratories (Westbury, NY), and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), respectively. The rat anti-PTP36 monoclonal antibody, 21-4, was established in our laboratory using a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids 399–738 of the PTP36 polypeptide (GST-P36/399–738) as an antigen. The expression construct pEFP36HA, which encoded influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged PTP36 (PTP36HA) was created as follows. The stop codon of the PTP36 cDNA was replaced by a sequence encoding a tandem repeat of the HA epitope. The cDNA encoding HA-tagged PTP36 was inserted into the ClaI/XbaI site of the mFas-Fc plasmid (18Suda T. Takahashi T. Golstein P. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1169-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2429) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the cDNA was subcloned into pUHD10-3, which contained a tet operator sequence (19Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4213) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pTREP36HA, and pNYpgk-pc, a plasmid possessing a puromycin resistance gene, were introduced into HeLa cells expressing a tetracycline-controlled transactivator (HtTA) using Tfx-20TM reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). Positive clones were selected in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, 0.4 μg/ml puromycin, 0.1 mg/ml geneticin, and 5 ng/ml doxycycline. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked in T-TBS (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 2% casein for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C and incubated with the primary antibodies. To detect the primary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG, or protein A, and the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used. To detect tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins using PY20, the low salt buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) was used for incubation and washing, and 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used for the blocking. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was precleared by the addition of 10 μl (pellet volume) of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. Then, the lysate was incubated with 10 μl (pellet volume) of protein A-Sepharose preloaded with 2 μg of the rabbit anti-FAK antibody for 1 h. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described (20Jinno Y. Ogata M. Chaudhary V.K. Willingham M.C. Adhya S. FitzGerald D. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15953-15959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells on a 34-mm tissue culture dish were washed with the cytoskeleton buffer (100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 4% polyethylene glycol 8000) and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in the cytoskeleton buffer for 10 min at room temperature. After permeabilization by 0.1% Triton X-100, cells were blocked by 10 mg/ml goat globulin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with the primary antibodies in PBS containing goat globulin. For the detection of the primary antibodies, 25 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (catalog no. 115-095-068, Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used. The polymerized actin was visualized using 0.2 μg/ml phalloidin-tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate in PBS. HtTA/P36-9 and HtTA/P36-18 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, 0.3 μg/ml puromycin, 0.1 mg/ml geneticin, and 5 ng/ml doxycycline. Overexpression of PTP36 was induced by incubating the cells in the culture medium without doxycycline. After 5 days, cells were collected by trypsinization and incubated in fresh culture medium overnight. Then cells were detached by incubating them in PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and 0.1% BSA. After washing, cells were used for the adhesion assay as described (21Toyama-Sorimachi N. Miyake K. Miyasaka M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were labeled by incubation in serum-free DMEM containing 5 μm5-carboxylfluorescein diacethoxymethyl ester (BCECF)-AM (catalog no. FM-0011-50, Dojin) at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by washing. The labeled cells (1.5 × 104) in 100 μl of DMEM containing 0.1% BSA were incubated in 96-well plates precoated with various extracellular matrix proteins. After a 20-min incubation at 37 °C, each well was filled with DMEM, and the plate was centrifuged upside down at 100 × g for 10 s. Cells attached to the plate were lysed in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, and the fluorescence intensity (530 nm) was measured (excitation wavelength at 490 nm). The wells of 96-well microtiter plates (catalog no. 25860, Corning Glass) were coated with various concentrations of extracellular matrix proteins in 50 μl of PBS at 37 °C for 1 h. The total protein concentrations were adjusted to 10 μg/ml by the addition of BSA. The plates were blocked with PBS containing 0.5% heat-treated (80 °C for 15 min) BSA at 37 °C for 1 h. The cytoskeletal fractions were prepared as described (22Arai M. Cohen J.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 38Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in the cytoskeleton stabilizing buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 250 mmsucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 120 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA) containing 0.15% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 25 mm NaF, and 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate for 5 min at 4 °C (total lysate). The total lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C yielding the pellet, which contained the polymerized actin and the intermediate filaments, and the supernatant, which contained the depolymerized actin and tubulin. To investigate the biological functions of PTP36, we established a cell line in which the expression level of PTP36 was regulatable. A HeLa cell line, HtTA, that expressed the tetracycline-controlled transactivator was transfected with an inducible construct containing the cDNA of PTP36 tagged with the HA epitope. Two cell lines, HtTA/P36-9 and HtTA/P36-18, were established, and similar results were obtained with them. HtTA/P36-9 cells were maintained in medium containing 5 ng/ml doxycycline and expressed little PTP36 protein (Fig.1 A,lane 1). Overexpression was induced by removing doxycycline from the culture. PTP36 was detectable after overnight culture and reached its plateau after 3 days (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). In the parental HtTA cells, PTP36 was undetectable in the presence or absence of doxycycline (data not shown). Then the subcellular distribution of PTP36 in HeLa cells was analyzed. PTP36 was found in the cytoskeletal fraction (P) containing actin and vimentin (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). The immunofluorescence study revealed that PTP36 and PTP36 fused to green fluorescent protein (PTP36-GFP) were enriched in the region near the cytoplasmic membrane (Fig. 2,a–c and e–g). Thus, we concluded that PTP36 in HeLa cells was enriched in the cytoskeleton near the plasma membrane. HtTA/P36-9 cells and the parental HeLa cells (HtTA) were cultured in the presence (off, the noninducing condition) or absence (on, the inducing condition) of doxycycline. The morphology of the uninduced HtTA/P36-9 cells did not differ significantly from that of the parental HtTA cells (Fig.3, upper panels). After 3 days of induction, however, HtTA/P36-9 cells became more rounded and spread less well than the uninduced cells (Fig. 3, lower panels). Similar results were obtained with HtTA/P36-18 cells (data not shown). No change in the morphology was detectable when the parental HtTA cells were cultured with or without doxycycline. In addition, HtTA/P36-9 cells (Fig. 4, A andB) and HtTA/P36-18 cells (data not shown) induced to express PTP36 grew slower than the uninduced cells. The growth inhibition was mild but very reproducible. In six independent experiments, the cell number was reduced to 66.3 ± 7.3% (50.5–72.9%) of that of control (uninduced) cells. No difference in the viability was observed using the dye exclusion method. Doxycycline revealed no effect on the growth of the parental HtTA cells (Fig. 4 A).Figure 4Growth of HtTA/P36-9 cells induced to overexpress PTP36. A, 5 × 104HtTA/P36-9 cells or parental HtTA cells were grown in a 6-cm tissue culture dish for 6 days in the presence (off) or absence (on) of doxycycline. B, HtTA/P36-9 cells were cultured in 96-well microtiter plates in the presence (off, open circles) or absence (on, closed circles) of doxycycline for 6 days. Then the proliferation was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Each well of triplicate wells was pulsed with 20 kBq of [3H]thymidine for 4 h. The data shown are the mean values ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The HtTA/P36-9 cells induced to overexpress PTP36 seemed to attach loosely to the culture dish. Therefore, we investigated the adhesiveness of HtTA/P36-9 cells to various extracellular matrix proteins. A representative result from four independent experiments is shown in Fig.5. The HtTA/P36-9 cells induced to overexpress PTP36 adhered to type IV collagen (Fig. 5 A) and laminin (Fig. 5 B) less well than uninduced cells. No difference was observed when the parental HtTA cells were cultured in the presence or absence of doxycycline. As shown in Fig. 5 C, the adhesion of HtTA/P36-9 cells to these matrix proteins was blocked almost completely by an anti-β1 integrin antibody, SG/19 (23Miyake K. Hasunuma Y. Yagita H. Kimoto M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The expression levels of β1 integrin subunits on the surface of the induced and uninduced HtTA/P36-9 cells were almost identical (Fig. 5 D). The cytoskeletons could have profound effects on the cell shape and the cell adhesion. Thus, we examined the cytoskeletons in the HtTA/P36-9 cells induced (on) or not induced (off) to overexpress PTP36. There was no difference found in the microtubules and the intermediate filaments containing vimentin (Fig. 6, i–l). In contrast, the actin stress fibers were greatly decreased in the induced HtTA/P36-9 cells (Fig. 6 b). Furthermore, the number of focal adhesions was reduced (Fig. 6 f). In the parental HtTA cells, doxycycline revealed little effect on the actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (Fig. 6, c, d, g, and h). Several sources of stimulation are known to induce the formation of focal adhesions or actin stress fibers. The integrin-mediated adhesion of cells to extracellular matrix proteins induces the formation of focal adhesions and the phosphorylation of various proteins including FAK. It is also known that LPA activates the small GTPase, Rho, to trigger the formation of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers as well as the phosphorylation of FAK. Defects in these signal transduction cascades might result in the reduction of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. Thus, we investigated the phosphorylation of FAK induced by the integrin engagement or LPA. Induction of PTP36 overexpression had little effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK induced by cell adhesion to fibronectin (Fig.7 A, lanes 2 and4). On the contrary, the LPA-induced phosphorylation of FAK was suppressed in the cells induced to overexpress PTP36 (Fig.7 B, lanes 2 and 4). The presence of a band 4.1 domain in the band 4.1 superfamily PTPs may suggest their involvement in the regulation of cytoskeletons and cell adhesion. However, little was known about their roles. In this study, we demonstrate that the overexpression of PTP36 has effects on cell growth, cell adhesion, cytoskeletons, and LPA-induced phosphorylation of FAK in the HeLa cells. The expression level of PTP36 in the induced HtTA/P36-9 cells was only 2–5-fold higher than the level of endogenous PTP36 in the 3T3 cells. In addition, no increase in the total phosphatase activity was detectable (data not shown). These results might support the possibility that the effects of PTP36 observed are not artifacts of overexpression. In HeLa cells, PTP36 is enriched in the membrane-associated cytoskeletal fraction. This distribution pattern is similar to that of PTPMEG, which localizes primarily to the membrane and cytoskeletal fractions (24Gu M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27751-27759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although we have found various effects of overexpression, this does not necessarily mean that multiple target molecules of PTP36 are present. Focal adhesions are the sites at which cells adhere to the extracellular matrix via integrin family receptors. At their cytoplasmic face, focal adhesions are linked to actin stress fibers. In addition, various signal transducing molecules have been identified in the focal adhesions (25Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar, 26Yamada K.M. Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Because focal adhesions are involved in both cell adhesion and signal transductions, their changes might affect cell morphology, adhesiveness to extracellular matrix proteins, and cell growth. The target molecule of PTP36 remains to be determined. Stimulation through integrins, growth factor receptors, and G protein-coupled receptors leads to the formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers (25Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar, 26Yamada K.M. Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 27Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins including FAK seems to be the essential step for these responses (25Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar,26Yamada K.M. Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 28Burridge K.

The overexpression of PTP36 inhibits the phosphorylation of FAK induced by LPA. LPA stimulates a G protein-coupled receptor and induces the formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers through the activation of Rho, a small GTPase (32Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5166) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the target molecule of PTP36 might be in the signaling cascade involving Rho. On the contrary, the overexpression of PTP36 reveals no inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of FAK induced by the cell adhesion to fibronectin. It was reported that the early, but not late, phosphorylation of FAK induced by integrin engagement occurred independently of Rho family GTPases (31Clark E. King W. Brugge J. Symons M. Hynes R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). This result suggests that PTP36 might not inhibit the early integrin signals leading to the FAK phosphorylation. Clearly, further study is necessary to elucidate the mechanism of the inhibition. So far, there is no evidence that PTP36 is playing the role of a PTP in HeLa cells. Among the band 4.1 superfamily PTPs, PTP36/PTPD2/Pez (6Sawada M. Ogata M. Fujino Y. Hamaoka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The amino acid sequence in the PTP domain of PTPD1/PTP-RL10/rPTP2E has a substitution of glutamic acid for the conserved aspartic acid. This aspartic acid acts as a general acid in the catalytic reaction (33Denu J.M. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). This substitution was reported to reduce thek cat of a PTP about 600-fold (34Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). There is a substitution of histidine for the aspartic acid in murine PTP36 but not in human PTPD2/Pez. To test the enzymatic activity, PTP domains of PTP36 and PTPD2/Pez were expressed as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins, and the catalytic activities were measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate. No significant, or very marginal, activity was detected for PTP36 and PTPD2/Pez, respectively. 2M. Ogata and T. Hamaoka, unpublished observations.These observations raise the possibility that some members of band 4.1 superfamily PTP, including PTP36, might have noncatalytic functions. In line with this notion, it was reported that the catalytic activity of PTPMEG, a member of band 4.1 superfamily PTP, was not essential for the functions of PTPMEG (10Gu M.X. York J.D. Warshawsky I.

Nonetheless, the PTP domain might be important for the function of PTP36. A deletion mutant of PTP36 (lacking amino acids 803–1184) was expressed in HeLa cells. This mutant possessed the band 4.1 domain but not the phosphatase domain and revealed little inhibitory effect on the adhesion of the cells to laminin.2 It was reported that the mutation of the invariant aspartic acid converted PTP into a catalytically inactive form, which could make a stable complex with tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates (34Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). It is possible that PTP36 might interact with signaling molecules through its multiple domains, including PTP and the band 4.1 domains, and function as an adaptor molecule. We thank Drs. H. Bujard and S. Takeda for kindly providing pUHD10-3 plasmid and for helpful information."
https://openalex.org/W1992982406,"Keratin polypeptide 19 (K19) is a type I intermediate filament protein that is expressed in stratified and simple-type epithelia. Little is known regarding K19 regulation or function, and the only other type I keratin that has been studied in terms of regulation is keratin 18 (K18). We characterized K19 phosphorylation as a handle to study its function. In vivo, serine is the major phosphorylated residue, and phosphopeptide mapping of 32PO4-labeled K19 generates one major phosphopeptide. Edman degradation suggested that the radiolabeled phosphopeptide represents K19 Ser-10 and/or Ser-35 phosphorylation. Mutation of Ser-10 or Ser-35 followed by transfection confirmed that Ser-35 is the major K19 phosphorylation site. Transfection of Ser-35 → Ala K19 showed a filament assembly defect as compared with normal or with Ser-10 → Ala K19. Comparison of K18 and K19 phosphorylation features in interphase cells showed that both are phosphorylated primarily at a single site, preferentially in the solubleversus the insoluble keratin fractions. K19 has higher basal phosphorylation, whereas K18 phosphorylation is far more sensitive to phosphatase type I and IIA inhibition. Our results demonstrate that Ser-35 is the major K19 interphase phosphorylation site and that it plays a role in keratin filament assembly.

The cytoskeleton of most mammalian cells consists of three distinct major protein families: microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments (1Bershadsky A.D. Vasiliev J.M. Cytoskeleton. Plenum Press, New York1988: 1-10Crossref Google Scholar). Among these three cytoskeletal protein groups, intermediate filaments (IF) 1The abbreviations used are: IF, intermediate filament(s); Emp, Empigen BB; K, keratin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; OA, okadaic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild type1The abbreviations used are: IF, intermediate filament(s); Emp, Empigen BB; K, keratin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; OA, okadaic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild typehave several unique features (2Steinert P.M.

For example, IF proteins make up a complex and diverse family; they are expressed in a tissue-preferential manner; their functions are poorly understood; they have a characteristic structure that consists of a central coiled-coil α-helical domain (termed “rod”) that is flanked by globular N-terminal (termed “head”) and C-terminal (termed “tail”) domains; and several mutations have been identified in IF proteins that result in a variety of skin, oral, and ocular diseases. Another feature of IF proteins is their expression in the nucleus (i.e. the lamins) and in the cytoplasm (2Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 593-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 3Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar, 4Fuchs E. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Among the cytoplasmic IF proteins, keratins make up the largest family and are expressed specifically in epithelial cells in a cell-specific manner (7Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar, 8Moll R. Schiller D.L. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Keratins (K) include more than 20 unique gene products (termed K1–K20) that are divided into type I (K9–K20) and type II (K1–K8) (7Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar, 8Moll R. Schiller D.L. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Most epithelial cells express at least one type I and one type II keratin as their predominant IF protein complement in an epithelial cell-specific manner (7Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). For example, basal keratinocytes express K5/14 with little if any K1/10, whereas suprabasal keratinocytes lose most if not all of their K5/14 and express K1/10. In addition, “simple-type” epithelia as found in the liver, exocrine pancreas, and intestine express K8/18 with various levels of K19 and K20. Among the keratins, K19 is unique in that it has a very short 13-amino acid tail domain, it is expressed in stratified and simple-type epithelia and in hair follicles, and it may serve as a skin stem cell marker (9Bader B.L.

Although the likely multidimensional functional roles of keratins are still under active study, two important functions are well established, and keratin phosphorylation appears to play a role in both functions. The first function is maintaining cell mechanical integrity as has been clearly demonstrated from the skin and ocular keratin-associated diseases (reviewed in Refs. 4Fuchs E. Cleveland D.W.

Lane E.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and from transgenic models that manifest a liver phenotype (reviewed in Ref. 14Omary M.B. Ku N-O. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the case of the liver, there is a strong correlation between exposure to a variety of cell stresses, with resultant hepatocyte toxicity, and a significant increase in keratin phosphorylation (reviewed in Refs. 15Ku N-O. Liao J. Chou C-F. Omary M.B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar and 16Omary M.B. Ku N-O. Liao J. Price D. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 31: 105-140PubMed Google Scholar). To that end, expression of K18 that is mutated at its major phosphorylation site (serine 52) in transgenic mice is associated with a significant increase in susceptibility to hepatotoxic injury as compared with transgenic mice that overexpress wild type K18 (17Ku N-O. Michie S.A. Soetikno R.M. Resurreccion E.Z. Broome R.L. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 2023-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A second functional role for keratins is the interaction with other cellular proteins such as the 14-3-3 protein family, which presumably regulates the known interaction of 14-3-3 proteins with a number of their binding partners (18Ku N-O. Liao J. Omary M.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1892-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The keratin/14-3-3 association is cell cycle-regulated in that it occurs with K18 (but not K19 or K8) only during the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle in a reversible fashion (19Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) upon phosphorylation of K18 serine 33 (18Ku N-O. Liao J. Omary M.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1892-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Therefore, the characterization of keratin phosphorylation and its significance is emerging as a productive approach for understanding not only keratin regulation but also its function. In this report we focus on characterizing K19 phosphorylation and begin to address its significance. The only keratins that have been studied in detail with respect to their phosphorylation are K1 (20Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13333-13339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), K8, and K18 (reviewed in Refs. 15Ku N-O. Liao J. Chou C-F. Omary M.B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar and 16Omary M.B. Ku N-O. Liao J. Price D. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 31: 105-140PubMed Google Scholar). However, most if not all of the 20 keratins are likely to be phosphorylated based on several criteria including: (i) the presence of multiple keratin-charged isoforms upon analysis by two-dimensional gels, (ii) the presence of numerous serines/threonines (Ser/Thr), many of which are in proximity to arginine/lysine/proline residues that indicate potential kinase targets, and (iii) biochemical evidence for the phosphorylation of several of the epidermal keratins (21Gilmartin M.E. Culbertson V.B. Freedberg I.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1980; 75: 211-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Kasahara K. Kartasova T. Ren X. Ikuta T. Chida K. Kuroki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23531-23537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we identify Ser-35 as the major K19 phosphorylation site during interphase and show that mutation of this site interferes with K8/19 filament assembly in transfected NIH-3T3 cells. K19 phosphorylation is dynamic and is likely to involve multiple sites based on the increase in the number of K19 phosphopeptides and 32PO4 incorporation upon treatment of cells with the Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (OA). Although K19 and K18 type I keratins have some similarities in their phosphorylation properties, we show that they also have unique features that are likely to have functional correlates. HT29 (human), BHK (hamster), and NIH-3T3 (mouse) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). K19 cDNAs were kindly provided by Drs. Pierre Coulombe (The Johns Hopkins University) and Richard Eckert (Case Western Reserve University). Antibodies used in this work were monoclonal antibody (mAb) L2A1, which recognizes human K18 (23Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4465-4472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); rabbit antibody 8592, which recognizes human K8 and K18 (24Ku N-O. Michie S. Oshima R.G. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar); mAbs 4.62 and VIM-13.2, which recognize human K19 and vimentin, respectively, from several species (Sigma). Other reagents used were OA (Alexis Corp., San Diego, CA), immobilized protein A-Sepharose and the BCA protein determination kit (Pierce), trypsin and chymotrypsin (Worthington), enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 32PO4-phosphoric acid (NEN Life Science Products). HT29 cells were cultured using RPMI 1640 medium; BHK cells and NIH-3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C. BHK cell culture medium also included 100 mm methotrexate. For okadaic acid treatment, cells were cultured with 1 μg/ml OA for 2 h (37 °C). Cell cycle analysis was carried out after fixing cells with 70% ethanol and then staining with propidium iodide as described (23Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4465-4472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HT29 or transfected BHK cells were labeled with 32PO4(250 μCi/ml, 5 h, 37 °C) in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 8% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 2% (v/v) normal phosphate-containing medium. For labeling in the presence of OA, the phosphatase inhibitor was added during the last 2 h of labeling. Cells, with or without different treatments, were collected and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. Cells were solubilized with 1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml okadaic acid (buffer A) (45 min, 4 °C), followed by pelleting (16,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). For some experiments, the residual pellet was subsequently solubilized with 1% Empigen BB (Emp) in buffer A (1 h, 4 °C) (25Lowthert L.A. Ku N-O. Liao J. Coulombe P.A. Omary M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 370-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation with mAb L2A1 (covalently conjugated to protein A-Sepharose) or with mAb 4.62 (plus protein A or G-Sepharose for 6 h at 4 °C) followed by washing five times with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in PBS. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 10% polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was carried out as described (27Liao J. Ku N-O. Omary M.B. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 1671-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with isoelectric focusing in the first dimension (horizontal) and SDS-PAGE in the second dimension (vertical). The stoichiometry of K19 phosphorylation was estimated by densitometric scanning of Coomassie-stained isoelectric spots 1, 2, and 3 and then calculating the optical density ratio of phosphorylated spot 3 to the total phosphorylated and unphosphorylated K19 spots (1 + 2 + 3). For peptide mapping, K19 bands were isolated from Coomassie-stained gels followed by electroelution, concentration, acetone precipitation, and digestion with trypsin or chymotrypsin as described (28Boyle W.J. Van Der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar, 29Ku N-O. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7556-7564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Peptide mapping was done using cellulose thin layer chromatography plates, with separation in the horizontal dimension by electrophoresis and in the vertical dimension by chromatography (28Boyle W.J. Van Der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). For manual Edman degradation, the major cellulose-containing32PO4-labeled spot was removed from cellulose plates followed by water extraction and lyophilization. The dried peptide was subjected to manual Edman degradation for 5–15 cycles as described (29Ku N-O. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7556-7564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The released materials after each cycle and the disks containing residual undigested peptide were counted. K19 Ser-35 → Ala and Ser-10 → Ala mutants were generated using a Transformer™ kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The cDNA for human K19 was used as a template. Mutation was confirmed by sequencing followed by subcloning into the pMRB101 mammalian expression vector with an hCMV promoter-directed expression. BHK or NIH-3T3 cells were cotransfected with wild type human K8 and one of three K19 constructs (wild type, Ser-35 → Ala, or Ser-10 → Ala). Given the phenotype that we observed with the Ser-35 K19 mutant, we also sequenced the entire K19 Ser-35 → Ala construct to confirm the absence of any other inadvertent mutations. Transfected NIH-3T3 cells were cultured on coverslips for 3 days and then fixed in methanol (3 min, −20 °C). Fixed cells were blocked with PBS that contained 2% bovine serum albumin and a 1% cytoplasmic extract of nontransfected NIH-3T3 cells (15 min). Blocked cells were coincubated with mAb 4.62 (1:50 dilution) and rabbit antibody 8592 (1:1000 dilution) in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. After washing, cells were blocked again with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 2% goat serum for 15 min followed by incubating with Texas Red and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies, respectively (30 min), and then washed five times with PBS. Cells were visualized using a Nikon TE300 microscope coupled to a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal microscope. Quantitation of the keratin filament assembly phenotype was done by assigning the visualized cells (done by an independent investigator without prior knowledge of the transfection construct type to prevent bias) as having normal filaments, collapsed filaments (perinuclear), or short filaments. All fields on the slide were counted, and cells that did not double stain with the anti-K19 (mAb 4.62) and antibody 8592 were excluded. We studied and characterized K19 phosphorylation to begin understanding its regulation and function. Metabolic labeling of colonic HT29 cells with32PO4 followed by immunoprecipitation of K8/19 showed incorporation of phosphate into both K8 and K19 (Fig.1 A). Phosphoamino acid analysis of 32PO4-labeled K19 indicated that all of the incorporated radioactivity resided on serine (Fig.1 C), which is similar to what has been noted for the epidermal keratins (20Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13333-13339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gilmartin M.E. Culbertson V.B. Freedberg I.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1980; 75: 211-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Steinert P.M. Wantz M.L. Idler W.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and for K8 and K18 (23Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4465-4472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Oshima R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3414-3421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous phosphorylation studies of K8 and K18 showed that K8/18 phosphorylation increases during mitosis and that there is a phosphorylation gradient in that the membrane/cytosolic keratin fraction has a higher specific activity of phosphorylation as compared with the remaining cytoskeletal compartment (15Ku N-O. Liao J. Chou C-F. Omary M.B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 19Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The membrane/cytosolic-enriched fraction is isolated using nonionic detergents (e.g. Nonidet P-40), and the remaining cytoskeletal fraction is efficiently extracted, although maintaining antigenicity for immunoprecipitation, using the zwitterionic detergent Empigen (25Lowthert L.A. Ku N-O. Liao J. Coulombe P.A. Omary M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 370-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We tested if K19 has similar phosphorylation properties to K8 and K18. As shown in Fig. 1 A, K19 manifests a phosphorylation gradient similar to K8 and K18 in that its phosphorylation increases in mitotically enriched cells (Fig.1 A, compare lane 2′ with 1′ andlane 3′ with 4′). In addition, K19 (and K8) phosphorylation is increased in the Nonidet P-40 fraction as compared with the Emp fraction (Fig. 1 A, compare lane 1′with 3′ and lanes 2′ with 4′). Furthermore, two-dimensional gel analysis (Fig. 1 B) shows an acidic shift of K8 (isoform 2) and K19 (isoform 3) in K8/19 that is isolated from the Nonidet P-40 fraction as compared with the Emp fraction. Similar acidic shifts in K19 and K8 were also noted in mitotically enriched cells after two-dimensional gel analysis (not shown). The stoichiometry of K19 phosphorylation in the Nonidet P-40 and Emp fractions under basal conditions is ∼24 and 18%, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures”). Of note, K19 isoform 2 does not appear to be phosphorylated as determined by the lack of incorporation of 32PO4 upon metabolic labeling, which is incorporated into isoform 3 only (not shown). A similar nonphosphorylated “isoform 2” was also observed for K18 (17Ku N-O. Michie S.A. Soetikno R.M. Resurreccion E.Z. Broome R.L. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 2023-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but the identity of the acidic modification(s) that accounts for this isoform is presently unknown. We used biochemical and molecular means to identify the K19 phosphorylation site(s). Metabolic labeling of K19 with32PO4 followed by protease digestion with trypsin or chymotrypsin and peptide mapping generated one major radiolabeled phosphopeptide (Fig.2 A). Manual Edman degradation of the purified phosphopeptide showed a single dominant radioactive serine that corresponds to the third amino acid position of the tryptic phosphopeptide (Fig. 2 B) and the fourth amino acid position of the chymotryptic phosphopeptide (Fig. 2 C). Inspection of the known K19 amino acid sequence (10Eckert R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Stasiak P.C. Purkis P.E. Leigh I.M. Lane E.B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and incorporation of the Edman degradation results and the predicted digestion sites of trypsin and chymotrypsin indicated that the major K19 phosphopeptide can only represent serine 10 (6YRQSS) and/or serine 35 (31FRAPS) phosphorylation. Mutation of K19 at Ser-10 or Ser-35 followed by transfection into BHK cells, radiolabeling with 32PO4, and tryptic peptide mapping showed that Ser-35 is the major phosphorylation site of K19 (Fig.3 D, note absence of the Ser-35-containing spot).Figure 3The major human K19 phosphorylation site is Ser-35. A, BHK cells were cotransfected with wild type K8 and one of three K19 constructs that corresponded to wild type K19 (WT), Ser-10 → Ala K19 (S10A), or Ser-35 → Ala K19 (S35A). After 3 days, cells were solubilized followed by immunoprecipitation of K8/19 using mAb 4.62.B-D, BHK cells were cotransfected with K8 and one of the three K19 constructs shown in A. After 3 days, cells were metabolically labeled with 32PO4 (5 h, 250 μCi/ml) followed by isolation of K19 and tryptic peptide mapping as in Fig. 2. Note that transfected K19 in BHK cells undergoes phosphorylation at several sites. The arrows in Band C correspond to the major tryptic peptide that is also phosphorylated in HT29 human cells (confirmed by mixed peptide mapping, not shown). The dotted arrow in D highlights the absence of a labeled phosphopeptide that corresponds to Ser-35, thereby indicating that Ser-35 is the major K19 phosphorylation site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Given that keratin phosphorylation can play a role in keratin filament organization, we asked if K19 Ser-35 has an effect on keratin filament assembly. As shown in Fig. 4, transfection of Ser-35 → Ala K19 into NIH-3T3 cells had a significant effect on filament assembly as compared with WT or with Ser-10 → Ala K19. As such, the Ser-35 K19 mutant resulted in a preponderance of cells that manifested perinuclear collapse (e.g. Fig.4 C) or short cytoplasmic filaments (e.g. Fig.4 D). For example, WT and Ser-10 → Ala K19 transfectants had 70 and 69%, respectively, of their cells with a normal-appearing filament organization, whereas the Ser-35 → Ala K19 transfectants had only 26% of their cells with normal-appearing filaments (TableI). Similar results were also obtained in transfected BHK cells (determined qualitatively, not shown). We chose NIH-3T3 cells for detailed quantitation of the immunofluorescence experiments instead of BHK cells (which were used primarily for protein isolation and peptide mapping experiments) because the latter have a significantly higher transfection efficiency (at the protein level) but far fewer cells that have normal-appearing filaments for all three constructs (particularly Ser-35 → Ala K19), thereby making assessment of an assembly phenotype in BHK cells inadequate. The keratin filament disruption that is noted in transfected NIH-3T3 cells does not affect the endogenous IF network (vimentin), as determined by double immunofluorescence staining using anti-vimentin and anti-keratin antibodies (not shown).Table IFilament assembly phenotype of wild type and mutant K19 contructs in transfected cellsFilament typeWT K19S35A K19S10A K19%%%Normal70 ± 126 ± 269 ± 5Collapsed19 ± 254 ± 717 ± 1Short11 ± 120 ± 714 ± 4NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with WT K8 and one of the three K19 constructs: WT, Ser-35 → Ala, and Ser-10 → Ala.

The percent ± S.E. is shown for each filament type and construct and represents an average of three experiments. The transfection efficiency was similar for each experiment and ranged from ∼5 to 10%. The number of cells counted per experiment (and per construct) was 60–120. Open table in a new tab NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with WT K8 and one of the three K19 constructs: WT, Ser-35 → Ala, and Ser-10 → Ala.

The percent ± S.E. is shown for each filament type and construct and represents an average of three experiments. The transfection efficiency was similar for each experiment and ranged from ∼5 to 10%. The number of cells counted per experiment (and per construct) was 60–120. Our earlier observations of K8/18 phosphorylation showed that K8 phosphorylation is ∼3–4-fold higher than K18 (19Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The relatively similar basal phosphorylation of K8 and K19 (Fig.1 A, lanes 1′ and 3′) prompted us to formally examine the relative stoichiometry and dynamic nature of K8, K18, and K19 phosphorylation. We also compared the effect of the phosphatase I and IIA inhibitor OA (32Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar) on K8, K18, and K19 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig.5 A (with quantitation in TableII), basal K19 and K8 phosphorylation are nearly equal, although basal K18 phosphorylation is significantly less than that of K8. Protein phosphatase inhibition by OA increases the phosphorylation of all keratins, but the increase in K19 phosphorylation is significantly less than that of K8 or K18 (Table IIand Fig. 5 A). The “relatively low” K19 hyperphosphorylation in the presence of OA is also evident by the small change in migration in SDS-PAGE gels as compared with K8 and K18 (Fig.5 A, hyperphosphorylated K8, K18, and K19 bands are highlighted by an asterisk). The results of these comparisons between K19 and K18 phosphorylation suggest that K19in vivo phosphorylation is regulated very differently than K18 and that K19 in vivo dephosphorylation involves different phosphatase(s) than those involved in K8 or K18 dephosphorylation.Table IIEfficiency of K8, K18, and K19 32PO4 labeling in cultured cells in the presence and absence of okadaic acidL2A1 i.p.4.62 i.p.K8K18K8/K18K8K19K8/K19−OA195 cpm50 cpm3.996 cpm72 cpm1.3+OA1840 cpm725 cpm2.5857 cpm262 cpm3.3+OA/−OA9.414.50.648.93.62.5HT29 cells were labeled with 32PO4 in the presence or absence of OA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoprecipitates (i.p.) of K8/19 (using mAb 4.62) and K8/18 (using mAb L2A1) were separated by SDS-PAGE and then stained with Coomassie Blue as shown in Fig. 5 A.

Activation of gp130 by leukemia inhibitory factor is sufficient to induce myocardial cell hypertrophy accompanied by specific changes in the pattern of gene expression. However, the molecular mechanisms that link gp130 activation to these changes have not been clarified. The present study investigated the transcriptional pathways by which leukemia inhibitory factor activates β-myosin heavy chain expression during myocardial cell hypertrophy. Mutation of the GATA motif in the β-myosin heavy chain promoter totally abolished leukemia inhibitory factor-responsive transcription without changing basal transcriptional activity. In contrast, endothelin-1 responsiveness was unaffected by the GATA mutation. Among members of the cardiac GATA transcription factor subfamily (GATA-4, -5, and -6), GATA-5 was the sole and potent transactivator for the β-myosin heavy chain promoter. This transactivation was dependent on sequence-specific binding of GATA-5 to the β-myosin heavy chain GATA element. Cardiac nuclear factors that bind to to the β-myosin heavy chain GATA element were induced by leukemia inhibitory factor stimulation. Last, leukemia inhibitory factor stimulation markedly increased transcripts of cardiac GATA-5, the expression of which is normally restricted to the early embryo. Thus, GATA-5 may be involved in gp130 signaling in cardiac myocytes. Leukemia inhibitory factor is a member of a family of structurally related cytokines sharing the receptor component gp130.

Thus, GATA-5 may be involved in gp130 signaling in cardiac myocytes. Cardiac muscle cells exit the proliferative cell cycle soon after birth, with little or no capacity for subsequent cell division. Hence, the adult myocardium responds to hemodynamic stimuli through an adaptive hypertrophic response that is characterized by an increase in myocardial cell size without a concomitant increase in myocyte number (for review, see Refs. 1Chien K.R.

As such, the identification of the signaling pathways that mediate cardiac muscle hypertrophy is critical to the ultimate elucidation of the molecular basis of cardiac muscle failure.

In this in vitro system, a number of growth factors signaling through G-protein-coupled receptors, including α1-adrenergic agonists, angiotensin II, and endothelin-1 (ET-1), stimulate increases in myocyte volume and reproduce many of the changes in cardiac gene expression characteristic of the hypertrophic program in vivo. Transcriptional regulation of cardiac genes by these stimuli has been extensively studied using transient transfection assays. DNA binding factors that might mediate the nuclear response to α1-adrenergic stimulation include the transcription enhancer factor-1 family, serum-responsive factor, and Sp1 (11Kariya K.

Recent work has demonstrated that members of a family of structurally related cytokines including leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and cardiotrophin-1 induce an increase in cell size in cardiomyocyte culture (17Pennica D.

The receptors of this cytokine family are multimeric and share the class-specific transmembrane signal-transducing component gp130 (19Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirno T. Taga T. Kishimoto T.

Signaling is triggered through the homodimerization of gp130 (24Murakami M. Hibi M. Nakagawa N. Nakagawa T. Yasukawa K. Yamanisi K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Science. 1993; 260: 1808-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) or the heterodimerization of gp130 with a related transmembrane signal transducer, the LIF receptor subunit β (25Gearing D.P.

Pan L. Taga T. Kisimoto T. Ip N.Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1993; 260: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Overexpression of both interleukin-6 and its receptor results in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 (i.e.activation) in the myocardium and left ventricular hypertrophy in vivo (27Hirota H. Yosida K. Kishimoto T. Taga T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4862-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Thus, the induction of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through gp130-dependent signaling pathways is not confined to the in vitro hypertrophy assay but is also observedin vivo. Activation of gp130 by LIF or cardiotrophin-1 is also associated with specific changes in cardiac gene expression (18Wollert K.C. Taga T. Saito M. Narazaki M. Kishimoto T. Glembotski C.C.

The molecular mechanisms that link gp130 activation to these changes have not been clarified. Members of the interleukin-6-LIF cytokine family have been shown to activate the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway and phosphorylate STAT3 (23Taga T. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 28Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar, 29Narazaki M.

Inoue M. Wang X. Wei S. Matsusaka T. Yoshida K. Sudo T. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1994; 77: 63-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). It is also clear that this family of cytokines can activate Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades (23Taga T. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 28Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar, 31Heim M.H. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 26: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). An activated Ras gene, targeted to myocardium in transgenic mice, elicits ventricular enlargement, atrial natriuretic factor expression, myofibrillar disarray, and impaired relaxation in diastole (32Hunter J.J. Tanaka N. Rockman H.A. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23173-23178Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Conversely, microinjection of dominant-negative Ras protein was reported to block α1-adrenergic induction of both morphological changes in myofibrillar structure and expression of atrial natriuretic factor (33Thorburn A. Thorburn J. Chen S. Powers S. Shubeita H.E. Feramisco J.R. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2244-2249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating a requirement of Ras-dependent pathways for G-protein-coupled signaling in myocardial cell hypertrophy. The relative contributions of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase and Janus kinase/STAT pathways to gp130-induced cardiac hypertrophy are presently unclear, however, because selective pharmacological inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation does not block hypertrophy (34Sheng Z. Knowlton K. Chen J. Hoshijima M. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5783-5791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others have shown that zinc finger GATA transcription factors are required for transcriptional activation of the genes for angiotensin II type 1a receptor and β-MHC during pressure overload hypertrophyin vivo (35Herzig T.C. Jobe S.M. Aoki H. Molkentin J.D. Cowley A.W. Izumo S. Markham B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7543-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 36Hasegawa K. Lee S.J. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. Kitsis R.N. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3943-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, pressure overload is a complex stimulus consisting of multiple factors. A specific stimulus linked to GATA factors has not been clarified. In addition, although so far six members of the GATA transcription factor family have been cloned, it is unclear which member of this family plays the most important role. Thus, the present study analyzed cis-acting elements andtrans-acting factors required for LIF-responsive β-MHC transcription during myocardial cell hypertrophy. Primary ventricular cardiac myocytes were prepared from hearts of 1–2-day-old Sprague Dawley rats as described previously (37Hasegawa K. Meyers M.B. Kitsis R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20049-20054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after plating, the cells were washed twice with serum-free media and then incubated with 5 μCi/ml [3H]phenylalanine (120 Ci/mmol) and unlabeled phenylalanine (0.36 mmol/liter) in serum-free medium for 48 h in the presence of 2.5 × 10−9m LIF (AMRAD, Melbourne, Australia), 10−7m ET-1 (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan), or saline as a control. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and 10% trichloroacetic acid was added at 4 °C for 60 min to precipitate protein. The precipitate was washed three times with 95% ethanol and then resuspended in 0.15 n NaOH. Aliquots were measured by a scintillation counter. Northern blot analysis of 10 μg of total RNA was performed as described (36Hasegawa K. Lee S.J. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. Kitsis R.N.

The murine GATA-4 expression plasmid pcDNAG4 was subcloned by digesting pMT2-GATA-4 (46Heikinheimo M. Scandrett J.M. Wilson D.V. Dev.

Plasmids were purified by anion exchange chromatography (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), quantified by measurement of A 260, and examined on agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide before use. Twenty-four hours after plating, cells were washed twice with serum-free media and then co-transfected with 4 μg of the luciferase construct of interest and 1 μg of pRSVCAT using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendation.

GATA-4/5 protein was prepared usingin vitro transcription and translation systems (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacture's recommendation. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were designed that contained GATA motifs from the β-MHC or cardiac troponin C (cTnC) promoters. The sequences of the sense strand of these oligonucleotides were as follows: β GATA, 5′-CTGTGGAATGTAAGGGATATTTTTGCTTCACTTTGAGCCA-3′; mut β GATA, 5′-CTGTGGAATGTAAGGTCAATTTTTGCTTCACTTTGAGCCA-3′; CEF-1, (GATA element in the cTnC promoter; Ref. 48Magnaghi-Jaulin L.

Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Greiner Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) and purified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. EMSAs were carried out at 4 °C for 20 min in 15-μl reaction mixtures containing 10 μg of nuclear extract, 0.25 ng (>20,000 cpm) of radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide, 500 ng of poly(dI-dC), 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 37.5 mm KCl, and 4% Ficoll 400. For cold competition experiments, a 100 molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide was included in the binding reaction mixture. Protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.25 × Tris-borate EDTA (1 × Tris-borate EDTA is 100 mm Tris, 100 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. To detect GATA-5 transcripts in cardiac myocytes, a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was carried out as described previously (51Shioi T. Matsumori A. Sasayama S. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2930-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For this particular experiment, we used ventricular myocytes isolated from 1–2-day-old DDY mice, because the rat GATA-5 sequence has not been published. One litter (8–12 pups) yielded ∼4 × 105 cells. Total RNA was isolated as described (36Hasegawa K. Lee S.J. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. Kitsis R.N. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3943-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 37Hasegawa K. Meyers M.B.

The PCR primers were designed on the basis of published mouse cDNA sequences for GATA-5 (44Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and GAPDH (39Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Kao T. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar) as follows; sense for GATA-5, TCCCACTCTCCTCAACTCT; antisense for GATA-5, ACACCAGGTCTCCTGACGTA; sense for GAPDH, TTGCCATCAACGACCCCTTC; and antisense for GAPDH, TTGTCATGGATGACCTTGGC. To define the optimal amplification conditions, a series of pilot studies were performed using various amounts of reverse transcription products and various cycle numbers of PCR amplification as described (51Shioi T. Matsumori A. Sasayama S. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2930-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). On the basis of these initial experiments, the linear portion of the amplification was determined for both genes. The following conditions were therefore chosen as standard for the PCR reactions in a volume of 50 μl: reverse transcription products from 300 ng of RNA for GATA-5 or 150 ng of RNA for GAPDH, 2.5 units of TaqAmpli polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), and 35 cycles of amplification for GATA-5 or 30 cycles for GAPDH and 100 ng of each sense and antisense primers. The amplification was carried out as follows: denaturation, 45 s at 94 °C; annealing, 45 s at 54 °C; and extension, 90 s at 72 °C. The PCR products (10 μl/lane) were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. All data are expressed as means ± S.E. The significance of differences between mean values was evaluated by the two-tailed Student's t test, and differences were considered significant at the p < 0.05 level. Neonatal rat ventricular cardiac myocytes respond to various hypertrophic stimuli by increasing protein synthesis and by specifically changing their patterns of gene expression,e.g. induction of β-MHC (12Kariya K.

Chem. 1992; 267: 10551-10560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether LIF induces a hypertrophic response to an extent similar to that of other previously well defined hypertrophic stimuli, such as ET-1, cardiomyocytes were treated with 2.5 × 10−9m LIF or 10−7m ET-1. As reported previously, these two stimuli elicit distinct forms of hypertrophy (width versus length; Ref. 18Wollert K.C. Taga T. Saito M. Narazaki M. Kishimoto T. Glembotski C.C. Vernallis A.B.

Therefore, we have used bulk protein synthesis as a measure of hypertrophy. Stimulation with LIF and ET-1 resulted in a 40 ± 7 and 46 ± 5% increase in the protein synthesis rate, respectively (Fig.1 A). Then we examined the expression of β-MHC by Northern blot using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the β-isoform of MHC mRNA. We performed these experiments using three independent preparations of cardiac myocytes. Stimulation with LIF and ET-1 increased the expression of β-MHC gene in cardiac myocytes by 3.8 ± 0.4- and 3.0 ± 0.5-fold, respectively, compared with the saline-stimulated states (Fig.1 B). However, neither LIF nor ET-1 activated the expression of a ubiquitously and constitutively expressed GAPDH gene. Thus, both LIF and ET-1 increased the protein synthesis rate and specifically activated β-MHC gene expression to a similar extent in cardiac myocytes. To determine whether the increase in β-MHC gene expression during LIF and ET-1 stimulation of neonatal rat ventricular cells is mediated at the transcriptional level by elements within the 5′-flanking region of the β-MHC gene, cardiomyocytes were transfected with a β-MHC-luciferase reporter construct containing 3542-bp rat β-MHC upstream sequence (p-3542β-MHCluc).

The efficiency with which apo(a) escapes the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is secreted by the liver is a major determinant of plasma Lp(a) levels. Apo(a) contains a series of domains homologous to plasminogen kringle (K) 4, each of which possesses a potential lysine-binding site. By using primary mouse hepatocytes expressing a 17K4 human apo(a) protein, we found that high concentrations (25–200 mm) of the lysine analog, 6-aminohexanoic acid (6AHA), increased apo(a) secretion 8–14-fold. This was accompanied by a decrease in apo(a) presecretory degradation. 6AHA inhibited accumulation of apo(a) in the ER induced by the proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin. Thus, 6AHA appeared to inhibit degradation by increasing apo(a) export from the ER. Significantly, 6AHA overcame the block in apo(a) secretion induced by the ER glucosidase inhibitor, castanospermine. 6AHA may therefore circumvent the requirement for calnexin and calreticulin interaction in apo(a) secretion. Sucrose gradients and a gel-based folding assay were unable to detect any influence of 6AHA on apo(a) folding.

Lp(a) consists of low density lipoprotein (LDL) in which apoB100, the sole protein component of LDL, is attached to apo(a) by a disulfide bond (3Utermann G.

Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 167-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). More than 90% of this variation is determined by inheritance at the apo(a) gene locus (13Boerwinkle E. Leffert C.C. Lin J. Lackner C. Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). High Lp(a) levels (>30 mg/dl) are associated with an increased incidence of various cardiovascular diseases (14Scanu A.M. Fless G.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1709-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that determine the rate of apo(a) secretion by the liver are therefore of considerable interest. Apo(a) is homologous to plasminogen and consists of multiple domains with homology to plasminogen kringle (K) 4, followed by domains homologous to the plasminogen K5 and protease domains (15McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). As many as 34 different apo(a) size isoforms (from <300 to >800 kDa) exist due to variation in the number of K4 domains encoded in the apo(a) gene (16Lackner C. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). There is an inverse correlation between apo(a) size and plasma Lp(a) level, accounting for 19–70% of the variation in plasma Lp(a) levels depending on the ethnic group (17Sandholzer C. Hallman D.M. Saha N. Sigurdsson G. Lackner C. Csaszar A. Boerwinkle E. Utermann G. Hum. Genet. 1991; 86: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Sequence polymorphism independent of K4 number also exists at the apo(a) gene locus, accounting for the remaining contribution of the apo(a) gene to plasma Lp(a) levels (18Cohen J.C. Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1630-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The K4 domains in apo(a) are of 10 types based on amino acid differences (19Morrisett J.D. Gaubatz J.W. Knapp R.D. Guevara Jr., J.G. Scanu A. Lipoprotein (a). Academic Press Inc. San Diego, 1990: 53-74Crossref Google Scholar). Each contains a “lysine-binding pocket” that, depending on the K4 type, is predicted to bind with varying affinity to lysine, lysine analogs, and proline (20Guevara Jr., J. Jan A.Y. Knapp R. Tulinsky A. Morrisett J.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 758-770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These domains are important for mediating the initial interaction of apo(a) with apoB in the first step of Lp(a) assembly (21Ernst A. Helmhold M. Brunner C. Petho-Schramm A. Armstrong V.W. Muller H.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6227-6234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and for the binding of Lp(a) to other proteins, such as plasminogen receptors and fibrin (22Harpel P.C.

Lipids. 1993; 67/68: 123-133Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Post-translational mechanisms also play an important role. Studies using primary baboon hepatocyte cultures demonstrated that apo(a) is synthesized as a lower molecular weight precursor with a prolonged residence time in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) before maturation and secretion. Maturation of apo(a) involves addition of O-linked glycans and conversion ofN-linked sugars to the complex form (7White A.L. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 509-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27White A.L. Rainwater D.L. Hixson J.E. Estlack L.E. Lanford R.E. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1993; 67/68: 123-133Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Mature apo(a) binds to the hepatocyte cell surface before release into the culture medium (8White A.L. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28716-28723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apo(a) is inefficiently secreted by the hepatocyte, and a portion of the precursor protein is retained inside the cell and is degraded by the proteasome (29White A.L. Hixson J.E. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9060-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30White A.L. Guerra B. Wang J. Lanford R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 275-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apo(a) allelic variants vary considerably in the extent of their intracellular retention and degradation. In particular, large apo(a) isoforms tend to be secreted less efficiently than small isoforms, accounting at least partially for the inverse correlation between apo(a) size and plasma Lp(a) levels (29White A.L. Hixson J.E. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9060-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the absence of detectable plasma Lp(a) associated with some (“null”) apo(a) alleles is explained by the production of apo(a) proteins which are unable to exit the ER and are completely retained inside the cells and degraded (29White A.L. Hixson J.E. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9060-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30White A.L. Guerra B. Wang J. Lanford R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 275-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently characterized the secretion of human apo(a) from primary cultures of mouse hepatocytes transgenic for a 17K4 form of the human protein. We found that human apo(a) is also inefficiently secreted from primary hepatocytes, and a large portion of the protein is retained inside the cell and degraded (31White A.L. Clin. Genet. 1997; 52: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The ER quality control machinery ensures that only correctly folded proteins exit this compartment and traverse the remainder of the secretory pathway (32Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3614) Google Scholar). Apo(a) undergoes extensive post-translational modification in the ER; each kringle domain contains 3 disulfide bonds and an N-linked glycosylation site. The inefficient secretion of apo(a) may therefore result from an intrinsic difficulty in achieving a correct conformation. Indeed, newly synthesized apo(a) requires a prolonged period (30–60 min) to fold (33White A.L. Guerra B. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5048-5055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and interacts with multiple ER chaperone proteins (30White A.L. Guerra B. Wang J. Lanford R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 275-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we demonstrate that the lysine analog, 6-aminohexanoic acid (6AHA), can increase the efficiency with which human apo(a) is secreted from transgenic mouse hepatocyte cultures. This increase in secretion is associated with a decrease in the portion of apo(a) targeted to the intracellular degradation pathway. We propose that 6AHA can act as a molecular chaperone for apo(a).

Lactacystin was from Calbiochem. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Lp(a) transgenic mice were obtained from Dr. Helen Hobbs. The mice were hemizygous for a human apo(a) cDNA encoding 17K4 domains, including all the unique K4 domains, under the control of the mouse transferrin promoter and were homozygous for a human apoB P1 phagemid clone spanning the entire human apoB gene (34Linton M.F.

In addition, the mice were homozygous knock-outs for the LDL receptor. 2H. Hobbs, personal communication. Throughout this paper, these mice are referred to as Lp(a) transgenic mice. Hepatocytes were isolated and cultured in a serum-free medium (SFM) formulation exactly as described previously (31White A.L. Clin. Genet. 1997; 52: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed with cells that had been in culture for 48–72 h. Steady-state labeling was performed as described previously (7White A.L. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 509-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For pulse-chase studies, cells were preincubated for 1 h in methionine- and cysteine-free SFM, labeled for 15 min with the same medium supplemented with 125 μCi/ml each of [35S]cysteine and Expre35S35S label, and then chased for between 0 min and 6 h in complete SFM. Compounds were added during the preincubation, labeling, and chase periods as described for individual experiments. Labeled media were collected and clarified for 5 min at 2,000 × g. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then lysed in extraction buffer (EB, 1% Triton X-100, 0.3% CHAPS, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris, pH 9.0). Protease inhibitors (CompleteR, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added to all samples. Samples were immunoprecipitated and analyzed on 4–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, as described previously (7White A.L. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 509-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception that a rabbit anti-Lp(a) antibody was used. For quantitation of apo(a), autoradiographs were scanned with an Arcus II desktop scanner, and bands were quantified using Scanalytics ONE-Dscan software. Analysis of serially diluted samples demonstrated that this method was quantitative over at least a 16-fold range. Values obtained were normalized to total cell protein determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). Apo(a) folding was examined as described previously (33White A.L. Guerra B. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5048-5055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were preincubated for 1 h and then labeled for 45 min, as described above. The media were then adjusted to 5 mm DTT, and the incubation was continued for a further 5 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS and chased for various periods in SFM. To harvest, the cells were placed on ice, washed 2 times with ice-cold PBS containing 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and then lysed in ice-cold EB + 20 mm NEM. Apo(a) was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, with or without prior reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, as described above. All experiments were performed using primary hepatocytes isolated from mice transgenic for human apoB and a 17K4 form of human apo(a) (Lp(a) transgenic mice; see “Experimental Procedures”). We have previously utilized the lysine analog, 6AHA, to examine the mechanism of association of newly synthesized apo(a) with the hepatocyte cell surface. 6AHA prevents apo(a) binding to the hepatocyte surface, presumably through its interaction with the apo(a) kringle domains (8White A.L. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28716-28723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31White A.L. Clin. Genet. 1997; 52: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the course of these studies we sometimes observed that more apo(a) was secreted from hepatocytes incubated with 6AHA compared with control cultures. Fig.1 A illustrates this effect in Lp(a) transgenic mouse hepatocytes. In this experiment, hepatocytes were labeled overnight with [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine in the presence or absence of 200 mm 6AHA. Human apo(a) and apoB were then immunoprecipitated from the cells and media and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 A). The apo(a) precursor was observed in lysates of both control and 6AHA-treated hepatocytes. However, since 6AHA disrupts the association of apo(a) with the hepatocyte cell surface (8White A.L. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28716-28723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mature apo(a) was only found in lysates from control cells (Fig. 1 A). Mature apo(a) was present in the media of both cell types, but 4.5-fold more apo(a) was recovered from 6AHA-treated versus control media. This difference was only partially accounted for by the decrease in cell-surface associated mature apo(a) in 6AHA-treated cells, and total mature apo(a) (cells + media) was 4.3-fold higher in 6AHA treatedversus control cultures (Fig. 1 A). An additional protein (Fig. 1 A, ×) was nonspecifically immunoprecipitated from the culture media. This protein binds to protein A and is consistently observed in the media of liver cell cultures (7White A.L. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 509-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 6AHA-mediated increase in apo(a) secretion was specific since secretion of human apoB100 and apoB48 (Fig. 1 A) and of endogenous albumin and transferrin (data not shown) was slightly decreased in 6AHA-treated cultures. The decrease in secretion of these proteins may reflect some sensitivity of the cells to the prolonged (overnight) incubation with 6AHA. The increased recovery of apo(a) from the media of 6AHA-treated cells was not due to enhanced immunoprecipitation of apo(a) in the presence of the lysine analog, since addition of 200 mm 6AHA to labeled cell lysates or culture media did not increase the amount of apo(a) precipitated (Fig. 1 B). In addition, immunoblotting of samples before and after incubation with antibody demonstrated essentially quantitative recovery of apo(a) in the immunoprecipitation (data not shown). To examine the mechanism of the 6AHA-induced increase in apo(a) secretion, pulse-chase experiments were performed. Hepatocytes were labeled for 15 min and then chased for up to 6 h in the presence or absence of 200 mm 6AHA. Apo(a) was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates and culture media and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.2). At both 0 and 30 min of chase, the amount of apo(a) recovered from control and 6AHA-treated cultures was virtually identical (ratio of control:6AHA at 30 min = 1.1:1). Thus, 6AHA did not increase the rate of apo(a) synthesis. The amount of apo(a) precursor in the cells decreased with increasing chase times at a similar rate in control and 6AHA-treated cultures (Fig. 2; ratio of precursor in control:6AHA-treated cells at 6 h = 1.2:1). The decrease in apo(a) precursor over time was accompanied by the appearance of mature apo(a). For both sets of cultures mature apo(a) appeared in the cell lysates at 60 min of chase. Mature apo(a) also appeared in the media at 60 min in 6AHA-treated cultures but not until 120 min for control cells. The earlier appearance of apo(a) in the media of 6AHA-treated cells may be partially explained by the release of cell-surface associated apo(a) by the lysine analog. However, the total amount of mature apo(a) at 60 min was greater (by 2.9-fold) in 6AHA-treated versus control cultures. By 6 h of chase, approximately 8-fold more secreted apo(a) and 6.5-fold more total (cells + media) mature apo(a) was recovered from 6AHA-treated versus control cultures. The increase in apo(a) secretion in the presence of 6AHA was accompanied by a decrease in apo(a) degradation. Over 6 independent experiments, 90 ± 3% (mean ± S.D.) and 27 ± 33% of apo(a) synthesized during a 15-min pulse was degraded in control and 6AHA-treated cells, respectively (p = 0.007). The extended kinetics of apo(a) secretion and degradation in both control and 6AHA-treated cultures are consistent with previous observations (7White A.L. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J.

The increase in recovery of mature apo(a) from hepatocyte cultures incubated with 6AHA could be explained by two mechanisms. First, 6AHA may increase the efficiency with which apo(a) exits the ER and undergoes maturation and secretion. Second, since 6AHA disrupts the cell surface association of apo(a), it may prevent rapid degradation of a cell-surface associated pool of apo(a). To distinguish between these possibilities, we treated cells with 6AHA in the presence of either the proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin (Fig.3), or the ER glucosidase inhibitor, castanospermine (CST) (Fig.4).Figure 4Effect of 6AHA on the CST-induced inhibition of apo(a) secretion. A, schematic representation of the processing of N-linked glycans in the ER lumen. Steps inhibited by CST are indicated. Calnexin and calreticulin bind to monoglucosylated proteins. 6AHA increases apo(a) transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. GSD, glucosidase; MSD, mannosidase B. Hepatocytes were preincubated, labeled for 15 min, and chased for 30 min or 6 h, in the absence of CST (−/−), with CST present in all incubations (+/+), or with CST present in the chase medium only (−/+). 6AHA (200 mm) was absent (−6AHA) or present in all incubations (+6AHA). Apo(a) was immunoprecipitated from the cells and media and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The positions of the precursor (pr) and mature (mt) forms of apo(a) and of a protein (×) nonspecifically recovered in immunoprecipitates of culture media are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Lactacystin inhibits ER-associated pre-secretory degradation of apo(a) and allows accumulation of the apo(a) precursor inside the cell (Ref.30White A.L. Guerra B. Wang J. Lanford R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 275-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 3). If 6AHA increases apo(a) secretion by enhancing its exit from the ER, it should inhibit the accumulation of the apo(a) precursor in lactacystin-treated cells. Hepatocytes were labeled for 15 min and then chased for 30 min (to measure apo(a) synthesis) or 6 h in the presence of 6AHA and/or lactacystin. Compared with untreated cells, 6AHA alone increased apo(a) secretion at 6 h by 11-fold (Fig. 3). No accumulation of the apo(a) precursor was observed at 6 h compared to control cells, consistent with the data in Fig. 2. When cells were treated with lactacystin alone, a modest 1.8-fold increase in apo(a) secretion was observed. However, the amount of apo(a) precursor remaining at 6 h was increased 12-fold relative to control cells (Fig. 3 A). When both 6AHA and lactacystin were present, there was again a marked increase in apo(a) secretion (14-fold) but relatively little accumulation of the precursor (2.6-fold more than control cells at 6 h, but only 20% of that in cells treated with lactacystin alone). These results strongly suggest that 6AHA decreases apo(a) degradation by enhancing the efficiency with which apo(a) is transported out of the ER. The ability of 6AHA to increase recovery of mature apo(a) in these cultures therefore appears independent of its effect on the cell surface association of apo(a). N-Linked carbohydrate is added to secretory proteins co-translationally in the ER lumen as GlcNAc2Mn9Glc3 precursors (where GlcNAc is N-acetylglucosamine, Man is mannose, and Glc is glucose). While the protein is still being translated, the outer and two inner glucoses are trimmed by ER glucosidases I and II, respectively (Ref. 35Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3791) Google Scholarand Fig. 4 A). Incorrectly folded proteins are recognized by the enzyme UDP-Glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase which re-attaches a single glucose to the N-linked sugar chain (36Sousa M. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Monoglucosylated glycans are then recognized by the lectin-like ER chaperones, calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) which bind to the proteins and help them fold (Ref. 37Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar and Fig. 4 A). The re-attached glucose is then removed by glucosidase II. Depending on the folded state of the protein, it will then either continue down the secretory pathway or will enter a re-glucosylation/deglucosylation cycle (involving cyclic interactions with CNX and CRT) until it is fully folded and can be secreted (Fig. 4 A). CST inhibits glucosidases I and II (38Fuhrmann U. Bause E. Pleogh H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 825: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). If CST is added prior to the label in a pulse-chase experiment, it prevents the co-translational removal of the 3 glucose residues from radiolabeled apo(a) and prevents the interaction of apo(a) with CNX and CRT (Ref. 30White A.L. Guerra B. Wang J. Lanford R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 275-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). Apo(a) secretion is almost completely prevented under these conditions, but its intracellular degradation is not affected (30White A.L. Guerra B. Wang J. Lanford R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 275-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33White A.L. Guerra B. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5048-5055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Treatment with lactacystin causes accumulation of the apo(a) precursor in these CST-treated cells but does not increase its secretion (Ref. 30White A.L. Guerra B. Wang J. Lanford R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 275-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholarand data not shown), confirming that addition of CST prior to labeling inhibits secretion of the radiolabeled apo(a) by preventing its transport out of ER. If CST is added after apo(a) has been radiolabeled (i.e. after co-translational removal of the initial 3 glucose residues), it can trap apo(a) in its monoglucosylated form and enhance the interaction of apo(a) with CNX and CRT (30White A.L. Guerra B. Wang J. Lanford R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 275-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, both secretion and degradation of apo(a) are blocked (Ref. 30White A.L. Guerra B. Wang J. Lanford R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 275-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 4 B). The effect of 6AHA on the secretion of the differentially glucosylated forms of apo(a) was examined in hepatocytes treated with CST either before (pre-translation) or after (post-translation) a 15-min pulse to trap radiolabeled apo(a) in its tri- and mono-glucosylated forms, respectively (Fig. 4 B). An increase in the molecular weight of the apo(a) precursor was observed in cells trea"

Whereas the nicked enzyme behaved like the intact enzyme on Sephadex G-75 column chromatography, it was dissociated into two fragments on the column containing 6 m urea. Upon the removal of urea, both fragments spontaneously refolded.

Rat liver l-serine dehydratase (SDH) 1The abbreviations used are: SDH, serine dehydratase; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; SDS-PAGE, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate(deaminase) (EC4.2.1.13 or threonine dehydratase (deaminase), EC 4.2.1.16) catalyzes the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent deamination ofl-serine (l-threonine) to yield pyruvate (α-ketobutyrate). SDH plays an important role in gluconeogenesis because the enzyme activity is remarkably induced by the consumption of high-protein diets, starvation, and other treatments (see Ref. 1Snell K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 325-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar for a review). The purified enzyme is a dimer with aM r 34,200 subunit (2Ogawa H. Miller D.A. Dunn T. Su Y. Burcham J.M.

PLP binds to Lys-40 to form a Schiff base, and its encompassing amino acid sequence, Ser-Xaa-Lys-Ile-Arg-Gly, is well conserved among SDHs from rat (5Ogawa H. Konishi K. Fujioka M. Biochim. Biophys.

Moreover, these enzymes have a glycine-rich sequence at a region 100–130 amino acid residues downstream of the PLP binding lysyl residue (9Datta P. Goss T.J. Omnaas J.R. Patil R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The importance of this motif in the interaction with the coenzyme was assessed by the finding that substitution of the glycine residues with aspartic acid residues impairs PLP binding to E. coli d-serine deaminase (11Marceau M. McFall E. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16926-16933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Marceau M. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16934-16941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two conserved sequences suggest that SDHs have evolved from a common ancestral protein (9Datta P. Goss T.J. Omnaas J.R. Patil R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PLP catalyzes a variety of enzyme reactions such as transamination, decarboxylation, isomerization, elimination, and so on (see Ref. 13John R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar for a review). Thus far, the crystal structures of more than 10 PLP enzymes are available (14Isupov M.N. Antson A.A. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Dementieva I.S. Zakomirdina L.N. Wilson K.S. Dauter Z. Lebedev A.A. Harutyunyan E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 603-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These enzymes are mainly from bacterial sources, with the exception of aspartate aminotransferases from chicken and pig livers. On the other hand, PLP enzymes are classified into at least three types of α, β, and γ families on the basis of their primary sequences (15Alexander F.W. Sandmeier E. Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). SDH, which catalyzes α,β elimination, belongs to the β family, whereas tryptophanase (14Isupov M.N. Antson A.A. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Dementieva I.S. Zakomirdina L.N. Wilson K.S. Dauter Z. Lebedev A.A. Harutyunyan E.H. J. Mol.

Harutyunyan E.H. Wilson K.S.

Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Thus, classification based on the sequence alignment does not always conform to that based on the reaction mechanism. For insight into this problem, we feel that it is vital to accumulate information about the crystal structure of the β family members, which are known to include tryptophan synthase (17Hyde C.C. Ahmed A.S. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) andE. coli threonine deaminase (18Gallagher D.T. Gilliland G.L. Xiao G. Zondlo J. Fisher K.E. Chinchilla D. Eisenstein E. Structure. 1998; 6: 466-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A crucial step toward this goal is to obtain pure enzyme for crystallization. Purification of SDH from rat liver was extremely hard because of its relatively low abundance and the sacrifice of numerous animals (19Nakagawa H. Kimura H. Miura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 28: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Nakagawa H. Kimura H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1969; 66: 669-683PubMed Google Scholar, 21Inoue H. Kasper C.B. Pitot H.C. J. Biol.

Methods. 1990; 20: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In this work, we have developed a bacterial expression and purification procedure and characterized the recombinant enzyme. Along with crystal data on other PLP enzymes, our key finding that SDH is specifically cleaved into two fragments by various proteases that can independently refold after denaturation strongly suggests that this enzyme is composed of at least two folding domains. Male Wistar strain rats (200 g) and male Japanese white rabbits (2.5 kg) were purchased from Sankyo Labo Service. Biochemical reagents were commercially available and used without further purification. Plasmid pCWOri+ was described previously (24Barnes H.J. Arlotto M.P. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5597-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The initial portions of E. coli mRNAs are usually rich in A and U, and the expression of foreign DNAs in the bacterium is often facilitated by making the relevant regions rich in A or T. Thus, we introduced three silent mutations in codons 2–5 (i.e. from the native sequence 5′-GCTGCCCAGGAG to the mutated sequence 5′-GCTGCTCAAGAT(the introduced changes are underlined)) via polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. Plasmid pCWOri+ has a NdeI restriction site (CA‖TATG; ‖ indicates the NdeI cutting site) coincident with the initiation ATG codon and multicloning sites ofXbaI, SalI, PstI, andHindIII downstream of the NdeI site. A foreign DNA is to be inserted between the NdeI site and any of the cloning sites. SDH cDNA had no NdeI site coincident with the initiation ATG codon and also had no usable restriction site in the 3′ noncoding region. Therefore, a NdeI site and aHindIII site were created by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. For this purpose, oligonucleotides 5′-TGGCCTGCTCAAGATTCCCTGCACGTG-3′ (the underlined sequence is part of the NdeI site) and 5′-GGATAAAGAAGCTTGGGCCACTGTC-3′ (the underlined sequence is the HindIII site) were synthesized as the 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively. The latter sequence is derived from the native antisense strand sequence corresponding to positions 35–59 downstream of the TGA stop codon (5′-GACAGTGGCCCACCCTTCTTTATCC-3′) (3Ogawa H. Fujioka M. Date T. Mueckler M. Su Y. Pitot H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14407-14413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With these two primers, the SDH cDNA containing the mutations was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction product was then digested with HindIII to produce a HindIII cut site at the 3′ end. Before ligation of the DNA, pCWOri+ was digested with NdeI, and the NdeI site was filled with the Klenow enzyme. This linearized plasmid was further digested with HindIII to remove the original insert, and the resulting plasmid was ligated to the modified SDH cDNA. This construct was designated pCW-SDH. SDH activity was determined by the dinitrophenylhydrazine method (19Nakagawa H. Kimura H. Miura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 28: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The complete reaction mixture consisted of 50 mm borate-KOH (pH 8.3), 50 mmserine, and 50 μm PLP/enzyme in 0.25 ml. The absorption coefficient of hydrazone is 11.6 mm−1, as determined with authentic sodium pyruvate. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of pyruvate per minute at 37 °C. All operations were carried out at a temperature of 0 °C to 4 °C unless otherwise stated.E. coli carrying pCW-SDH were cultured in 2YT medium (25Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C. IPTG was added to make a final concentration of 0.5 mm when the cell turbidity measured at 600 nm reached about 0.4, and the culture was continued for an additional 14 h. The cells suspended in 20 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol received 10 mg of lysozyme. They were kept at 0 °C for 15 min, followed by −80 °C for 30 min. After sonication at 200 watts for 1 min, the suspension was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant from 1 liter of cultured cells was then put on a DE-52 column (Whatman; diameter, 2 cm; height, 6 cm) prewashed with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The column was washed with 100 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm mercaptoethanol. Ammonium sulfate was added at 28 g/100 ml to the flow-through fraction. After 1 h, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min and dissolved in 5 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). After a brief centrifugation, the clarified solution was applied to a column of Sephacryl S-200 (Pharmacia; 3.2 × 97 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 50 μm PLP, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Fractions with a high specific activity were pooled and put on an AH-Sepharose column (Pharmacia; 2 × 7 cm) equilibrated with 10 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.8). SDH appeared as a single peak at about 40 mm potassium phosphate when eluted by a linear gradient of 100 ml each of 10 mm and 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8) containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The fractions judged pure by SDS-PAGE were collected and concentrated by a Collodion bag. The enzyme was kept in portions on ice or at −80 °C without loss of activity for at least a month. Trypsinolysis (l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin; Worthington) was done in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at the substrate:protease ratio of 1,000:1 (w/w) and a temperature of 25 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding a 5-fold molar excess of leupeptin over trypsin. The digest was subjected to 13.5% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was soaked in 1 m KCl. The visualized large and small bands were cut out and electroeluted in TAE (40 mmTris acetate, 1 mm EDTA) buffer (25Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Alternatively, the digest (5 mg) was brought to 6 m urea and size-fractionated on a Sephadex G-75 column (1.8 × 98 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 6 m urea. Two-ml portions were fractionated by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm. The fractions containing the large or small fragments were dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.1 mmEDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol overnight and concentrated by a Collodion bag. The amino acid sequence of the polypeptide (100 pmol) was determined by automated Edman degradation on a Shimadzu PPSQ-10 gas-phase sequencer. Absorption and CD spectra were measured using a Hitachi 320 spectrophotometer and a Jasco J-500C spectropolarimeter, respectively. The α-helix content was estimated by the method of Chen and Yang (26Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 44: 1285-1291Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar).

The IPTG-induced SDH activity in a crude extract was found to be about 2 units/mg. The specific activity of SDH purified from rat liver was in the range of 150–989 units/mg (19Nakagawa H. Kimura H. Miura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 28: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Nakagawa H. Kimura H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1969; 66: 669-683PubMed Google Scholar, 21Inoue H.

Methods. 1990; 20: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar); thus, a 75- to 500-fold purification appeared to be necessary for homogeneity. A plausible cause of the low expression was the instability of the enzyme in this strain. We then resorted to E. coli BL21, which lacks both ATP-dependent Lon protease (31Phillips T.A. Van Bogelen R.A. Neidhardt R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 283-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and OmpT outer membrane protease (32Grodberg J. Dunn J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). As expected, the BL21 cell extract was found to have an enzyme activity 5-fold higher than that of the JM109 extract. Fig.1 A shows SDS-PAGE of the extracts. The IPTG-treated JM109 cell extract had aM r 35,000 protein corresponding to the subunit of rat liver SDH. This band was more intense in BL21 cells than in JM109 cells (lanes 2 and 4). Immunoblot analysis with the IgG to rat liver SDH indicated that JM109 contained not only the M r 35,000 band but a faint band ofM r 24,000. This band became more evident in an aged preparation (Fig. 1 B, lane 4) or in a preparation from JM109 cells grown at 31 °C (data not shown), but it was not found in the BL21 extract. Thus, it is thought that the low expression of the enzyme in JM109 cells results from extensive proteolysis. SDH was purified fromE. coli BL21 by the conventional procedure as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Approximately 15 mg of pure enzyme were obtained from a 1-liter culture. The enzyme activity emerged as a single peak on AH-Sepharose or DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. The chromatography deprived PLP of SDH, as found with a colorless preparation. The addition of PLP to the apoenzyme allowed absorption maxima to be restored at 330 and 415 nm, as reported previously for rat liver enzyme (20Nakagawa H. Kimura H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1969; 66: 669-683PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid analysis indicated that the N terminus of the recombinant enzyme was alanine, whereas that of the liver enzyme was acetylalanine (4Leoncini R. Henschen A. Krieglstein K. Calvete J. Pagani R. Marinello E. Ital. J. Biochem. (Engl. Ed.). 1990; 39: 228-234PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ogawa H. Konishi K. Fujioka M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 996: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, in E. coli, the N-terminal methionine residue is removed from the enzyme by posttranslational modification, but acetylation of the new terminal residue does not occur. The native and subunit molecular weights were about 66,000 by gel filtration and 34,000 by SDS-PAGE, respectively, indicating that the recombinant enzyme is a dimer like the liver enzyme. TheK m values for serine and threonine of the recombinant enzyme were 67 and 50 mm, respectively, which were almost comparable to those reported for the liver enzyme (20Nakagawa H. Kimura H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1969; 66: 669-683PubMed Google Scholar). TheV max value for serine of the recombinant enzyme was about 200 units/mg. This was almost comparable to theV max of liver enzyme of 155 units/mg by Nakagawa and Kimura (20Nakagawa H. Kimura H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1969; 66: 669-683PubMed Google Scholar), 350 units/mg by Inoue et al. (21Inoue H. Kasper C.B. Pitot H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2626-2632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 278 units/mg by Simon et al. (22Simon D. Hoshino J. Kroeger H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 321: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) but differed greatly from that by Leoncini et al. (989 units/mg; Ref. 23Leoncini R. Guerranti R. Paani R. Marinello E. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1990; 20: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 suggested that SDH was vulnerable to attack by proteases. Then the purified enzyme (the apoenzyme form) was examined for susceptibility to various proteases. The reactions were done at the substrate:protease ratio of 1,000:1 to 30:1 by w/w. As shown in Fig. 2, trypsin and lysyl endopeptidase produced two fragments with molecular weights of 22,000 (large fragment) and 12,000 (small fragment).Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease also brought two fragments with molecular weights of 21,000 and 13,000. Subtilisin cleaved the enzyme into two fragments comparable to the tryptic fragments in size. However, the enzyme was virtually or considerably resistant to arginyl endopeptidase, chymotrypsin, and thermolysis at the concentrations examined. Similar results were obtained with the holoenzyme (data not shown). These results suggest that PLP does not protect against proteolysis. To clarify the relationship between proteolysis and inactivation, an apoenzyme was incubated with trypsin as described above, and aliquots of the reaction mixture were withdrawn over time. Trypsin abolished the enzyme activity following pseudo-first order kinetics (Fig.3 A). SDS-PAGE showed the appearance of M r 22,000 andM r 12,000 bands with time (Fig. 3 B,left panel). There was a stoichiometry between the loss of enzyme activity and the disappearance of the parent band by proteolysis (Fig. 3 B, right panel). The monospecific IgG to the recombinant enzyme predominantly reacted with theM r 22,000 band (Fig. 3 C). Next we determined the proteolytic site. After treatment with trypsin, the digest was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the large and small fragments were recovered from the gel. Edman degradation demonstrated that the first 10 amino acid sequences of the large and the small fragments were consistent with the N-terminal sequence of the intact protein and the amino acid sequence of a peptide from Ala-221 to Gln-230, respectively. Likewise, the cleavage site by S. aureus V8 protease was identified to be between Glu-206 and Gly-207. In this section, we studied the spectral change of a nicked enzyme. For this, the recombinant enzyme (the holoenzyme form) was digested with trypsin until an over 95% loss of the enzyme activity occurred and was then dialyzed extensively. The treated enzyme exhibited about 50% reduced absorptions at 330 and 415 nm and showed almost no difference in absorption at 280 nm compared with the control enzyme (Fig.4 A). Likewise, the apoenzyme was digested with trypsin, followed by an incubation with 200 μm PLP and dialysis. This enzyme also showed about 50% decreased absorptions at 330 and 415 nm compared with the PLP-reconstituted enzyme (data not shown). CD is a good tool to explore the secondary structure of protein. It is known that PLP itself gives no CD spectrum between 300 and 480 nm. When bound to the apoenzyme, PLP could induce a CD spectrum with positive ellipticities at 330 and 415 nm (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, the holoenzyme previously nicked with trypsin gave no appreciable signal in this region. Similarly, the apoenzyme previously nicked and then reconstituted with PLP did not display a positive ellipticity at either 330 or 415 nm (data not shown). On the other hand, both the intact and nicked holoenzymes exhibited similar CD spectra in the far-UV region; their α-helices were estimated to be 54% and 51%, respectively (Fig.4 C). These results show that proteolysis fairly impairs coenzyme binding without accompanying a gross change in the secondary structure. We further addressed the question of whether the two fragments are separable under nondenaturing conditions. To test this, the trypsin-treated enzyme was applied to a Sephadex G-75 column. The nicked enzyme appeared at the position identical to that of the intact enzyme as monitored with the absorption at 280 nm, suggesting that both fragments still associate with each other. Accumulating crystal data have revealed that many PLP enzymes constitute two (or three) folding domains (13John R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). If SDH is made up of distinct folding domains, these domains may be capable of refolding independently under renaturing conditions after denaturation. Thus, a nicked enzyme was denatured with 6 m urea and subjected to separation on a Sephadex G-75 column containing 6 m urea. The isolated fragments were confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.5 A). Urea was removed by extensive dialysis, and the CD spectra thereof were measured in the far-UV region (Fig. 5 B). As a reference, an uncut enzyme was processed in a similar manner. The renatured protein had a specific activity of 144 units/mg and 41% α-helix, corresponding to 72% and 76% of the specific activity and α-helix of the unprocessed enzyme, respectively. Under these conditions, the large and small fragments independently refolded, and the calculated α-helices were 14% and 37%, respectively (Fig. 5 C). Although it is unknown at present to what extent the α-helices are included in the large and small segments of the SDH polypeptide, the α-helix of the refolded large fragment seems to be less than that of the small fragment or the native protein. These results do not exclude the possibility that the large fragment could not refold more efficiently than the small fragment. It has been proposed that protein folding in eukaryotes is cotranslational, whereas that in prokaryotes is posttranslational (33Netzer W.J. Hartl U. Nature. 1997; 388: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). It is possible that the folding of the recombinant enzyme may be different from that of liver enzyme or that the absence or presence of N-terminal blocking may be responsible for the different folding pattern in the recombinant and liver SDHs. To test this possibility, liver enzyme was partially purified through ammonium sulfate fractionation and gel filtration (Fig. 6 A) and subjected to limited proteolysis followed by immunoblot analysis. The preparation that was not treated with trypsin exhibited two bands ofM r 22,000, and M r 24,000 other than an intact band (Fig. 6 B, lane 4). Because no protein inhibitor was included in the course of purification, these subbands were considered to be degradation products. Trypsin treatment increased the M r22,000 band accompanying the disappearance of the parent band (Fig.6 B). The result suggests that the liver enzyme is also susceptible to trypsin. SDH is widely spread in nature, but its physicochemical properties are considerably different f"

The G protein α-subunit Gα16, which is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells, is highly regulated during differentiation of normal and leukemic cells. In human erythroleukemia cells, suppression of Gα16 inhibited cellular growth rates. A reporter gene system was established to assess the role of Gα16 on erythroid differentiation of MB-02 erythroleukemia cells. It is based on transient transfection with a plasmid that expresses green fluorescent protein under the control of the β-globin promoter. Expression of Gα16 led to a significant increase in green fluorescent protein-positive cells, as did transfection with a Gα16 antisense plasmid (154 and 156% of controls, respectively). The GTPase-deficient, constitutively active mutant of Gα16, Gα16R186C, further stimulated differentiation to 195% of control values. Because the effect of Gα16 is triggered most efficiently by the GTP-bound protein, an indirect action through interference of overexpressed Gα16 with G protein βγ-subunits can be excluded. The corresponding mutant of Gαq (GαqR182C), the phylogenetically closest family member of Gα16, had no effect. The data define a specific role for Gα16-dependent signal transduction in cellular differentiation: deviations from optimal levels of Gα16 functional activity lead to reduced growth rates and promote differentiation in hematopoietic cells.

The data define a specific role for Gα16-dependent signal transduction in cellular differentiation: deviations from optimal levels of Gα16 functional activity lead to reduced growth rates and promote differentiation in hematopoietic cells. Receptor-coupled heterotrimeric G proteins are known to mediate signals that modulate growth factor-dependent cellular proliferation (1Post G.R. Heller Brown J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). G protein-linked second messengers, such as Ca2+ or cAMP, as well as G protein βγ-subunits released upon G protein activation, may be involved in this modulation. Ultimately, these signaling elements are thought to act on mitogen-activated protein kinase or on c-Jun amino-terminal kinase modules, which serve as central regulators for cellular growth and differentiation (2Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 3Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). In some endocrine tumors, mutations in clearly defined codons for conserved amino acids result in GTPase-deficient (i.e. GTP-bound, constitutively active) G protein α-subunits of Gs and Gi2, known as the products of the gsp and gip oncogenes (4Lyons J. Landis C.A. Harsh G. Vallar L. Grunewald K. Feichtinger H. Duh Q.Y. Clark O.H. Kawasaki E. Bourne H.R. McCormick F.

Nature. 1990; 340: 692-696Crossref Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). In transfected cell lines, GTPase-deficient mutants of Gαs and Gαi2, as well as corresponding mutants of Gα12/13 and Gαq, stimulate mitogenic responses. The mechanisms for mitogenic stimulation may involve elevated levels of cAMP (Gαs) or activation of phospholipase Cβ (Gαq). However, in many cases, the signaling pathways involved are not clear. Paradoxically, G protein-mediated signaling may also be associated with growth inhibition and cellular differentiation. Overexpression of GTPase-deficient Gαq in rat pheochromocytoma cells induces neurite outgrowth (6Heasley L.E. Storey B. Fanger G.R. Butterfield L. Zamarripa J. Blumberg D. Maue R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 648-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutively active forms of Gα13 promote differentiation of P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells into an endodermal phenotype (7Jho E.-H. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24468-24474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Both appear to involve stimulation of the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase pathway. In mouse embryonic stem cells, expression of Gαi2 or its GTPase-deficient mutant results in adipogenic differentiation (8Su H.L. Malbon C.C. Wang H.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1729-C1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression levels of members of all classes of G protein α-subunits are found to be regulated during cellular differentiation (9Wang H.Y. Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 10Watkins D.C. Johnson G.L. Malbon C.C. Science. 1992; 258: 1373-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 11Huppertz C.

These observations indicate a potentially widespread role of G protein α-subunits in differentiation programs. However, conclusive evidence that G protein regulation is the initiating event of the differentiation process is still lacking in most cases. The molecular cloning of Gα16, a novel member of the Gq family of G proteins, and the analysis of its tissue distribution revealed that it is uniquely expressed in normal and in malignant hematopoietic cells. Its expression is confined to hematopoietic cell lines that were derived from early stages of differentiation and is absent or strongly down-regulated in differentiated normal cells or in leukemia cell lines after induction of differentiation (12Mapara M.Y.

Immunology. 1997; 90: 564-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In peripheral blood T-lymphocytes, Gα16 expression is transiently up-regulated after lymphocyte activation, whereas the expression of Gαi2 and of Gαq remains unchanged (18Lippert E. Baltensperger K. Jacques Y. Hermouet S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether Gα16 modulates T-cell activation, regulated expression of Gα16 was disrupted by stably overexpressing Gα16 or Gα16 antisense RNA in Jurkat T-cells, a human T lymphoma cell line. Activation of Gα16-deregulated Jurkat T-cells was inhibited as demonstrated by a reduced up-regulation of interleukin-2 and of the activation-specific surface antigen CD69 (18Lippert E. Baltensperger K. Jacques Y. Hermouet S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These results suggest a critical role of tightly regulated Gα16 expression in lymphocyte activation. Further information about potential roles of Gα16accumulated mostly from experiments in nonhematopoietic cells by overexpression studies. In Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, constitutive activation of Gq-dependent pathways by overexpression of GTPase-deficient mutants of Gαq and Gα16 results in growth arrest or in reduced growth in response to platelet-derived growth factor or serum, respectively (19Qian N.X. Russell M. Buhl A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17417-17423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In small cell lung carcinoma, overexpression of a GTPase-deficient mutant of Gα16 inhibits growth (20Heasley L.E. Zamarripa J. Storey B. Helfrich B. Mitchell F.M. Bunn Jr P.A. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 349-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and in rat pheochromocytoma cells, it induces differentiation (6Heasley L.E. Storey B. Fanger G.R. Butterfield L. Zamarripa J. Blumberg D. Maue R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 648-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Gα16 has also been reported to be involved in growth stimulatory events. Activation of the receptor for complement fragment C5a in human embryonic kidney cells leads to a pronounced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase when coexpressed with Gα16 (21Buhl A.M. Osawa S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19828-19832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings imply that Gα16-dependent signaling may modulate cellular proliferation or differentiation, depending on the specific cellular environment. Although G16 may interact with a broad spectrum of receptors in some overexpressing systems (22Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), selective coupling of receptors to G16, but not to Gq, was observed for the C-X-C chemokine interleukin-8, as well as for complement fragment C5a, and for the chemotactic peptide formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (23Amatruda III T.T.

In the human erythroleukemia (HEL) 1The abbreviations used are: HEL, human erythroleukemia; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; Epo, erythropoietin; SCF, stem cell factor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CMV, cytomegaloviruscell line, Gα16 specifically couples to the P2Y2(P2U) purinoceptor (26Baltensperger K. Porzig H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10151-10159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting that Gα16might assume specific roles in individual cells or cell lines. However, its role in hematopoietic cells is still poorly defined in view of its lineage-independent but differentiation stage-dependent expression. In the present study, we examined the role of Gα16 in growth and differentiation of erythroleukemic cells. A reporter gene assay was established, to detect entry into erythroid differentiation in transiently transfected cells. The results indicate that changes in the expression level and functional activity of Gα16 lead to the induction of differentiation in the factor-dependent erythroleukemia cell line MB-02. The data suggest a new role of Gα16-dependent signaling in the decision between cellular proliferation and differentiation. Cell culture media and medium supplements were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Healthy donors who had received no recent medications were the source of human serum, which was heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min and stored at −20 °C for up to 6 months. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), erythropoietin (Epo), and stem cell factor (SCF) were generous gifts from Werthenstein-Chemie (Schachen, Switzerland), Cilag AG (Schaffhausen, Switzerland), and Dr. E. K. Thomas (Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA), respectively. Unless otherwise mentioned, all chemicals (analytical grade), were from Sigma Chemicals (Buchs, Switzerland) or from Merck AG (Dietikon, Switzerland). MB-02 cells (27Morgan D.A. Gumucio D.L. Brodsky I. Blood. 1991; 78: 2860-2871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in basal medium (RPMI 1640 medium, 10% human serum, 2 mm Glutamax I (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin), supplemented with 5 ng/ml GM-CSF and kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Cells were passaged every third day and replated at a density of 4 × 105/ml. The protocol for the induction of differentiation was adapted from Broudy et al. (28Broudy V.C. Morgan D.A. Lin L. Zsebo K.M. Jacobsen F.W. Papayannopoulou T. Blood. 1993; 82: 436-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and plated at a density of 106 cells/ml in fresh basal medium supplemented with 25 ng/ml SCF and 4 units/ml Epo and left undisturbed for a week prior to further routine passaging for another 7–10 days. Hemoglobin-producing cells were detected by benzidine staining of cellular suspensions (29Orkin S. Harosi F.I. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The HEL cell lines, 3D4 and 1E3, with suppressed Gα16expression were generated by stable transfection of parental HEL cells derived from clone 92.1 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) with an antisense plasmid to Gα16 and have been described previously (26Baltensperger K. Porzig H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10151-10159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). G418 sulfate-resistant cells that expressed wild-type levels of Gα16 (9G10 and 7H6) were used as controls. All cell lines were maintained in the presence of G418 sulfate (400 μg/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium, which was supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm Glutamax I, 1 mmsodium pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. For growth studies, cultures were counted every 48 h using a Coulter Counter (Coulter Electronics, Ltd.) COS-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm Glutamax I, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium). The reporter plasmid piGFP was assembled as follows: the full-length sequence encoding a highly fluorescent version of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was excised from phGFP-S65T (CLONTECH) using the SacI andXbaI sites and inserted into the cloning vector pUC19 (New England Biolabs). After EcoRI and SalI double digestion, the fragment including GFP was inserted into the similarly digested expression vector pEV3 (generously provided by Dr. H. Weir Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Cheshire; United Kingdom). As a positive control, a plasmid constitutively expressing GFP (pcGFP) was generated by cloning the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter into piGFP upstream of GFP. The full-length sequence encoding CMV was cut out from the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Inc.) by digestion withEcoRI and MunI and then ligated into the uniqueEcoRI site of piGFP. As a nonfluorescent control, pclacZ was constructed replacing GFP in pcGFP with lacZ from the expression vector pCMV-lacZ (a gift from Dr. S. Rusconi, University of Fribourg, Switzerland). For cotransfection experiments, the different G protein genes were cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3. The plasmids pG16AS and pG16WT, harboring a full-length copy of the human Gα16cDNA in antisense or sense direction, respectively, were described previously (26Baltensperger K. Porzig H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10151-10159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In order to generate pG16RC, the GTPase-deficient, constitutively active mutant of Gα16, Gα16R186C, was recovered from pVL1393Gα16R186C (a gift from Drs. A. Dietrich and P. Gierschik, University of Ulm, Germany) and cloned into the uniqueXbaI site of pcDNA3. A plasmid expressing the corresponding GTPase-deficient mutant of Gαq, pCISGαqR182C, was a gift of Dr. M. I. Simon (California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA). A plasmid encoding the GTPase-deficient mutant of Gαi2, Gαi2Q205L, was constructed by excising the coding region from pCW1Gαi2Q205L (30Lowndes J.L. Gupta S.K. Osawa S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14193-14197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inserting it into pcDNA3 at the HindIII site. pGi3AS was assembled using theBamHI fragment of pCISGαi3 (also from Dr. M. I. Simon), which was inserted in antisense orientation into pcDNA3. MB-02 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended at a density of 2 × 106/ml in phosphate-buffered sucrose (sucrose, 272 mm; MgCl2, 1 mm; NaH2PO4, 7 mm; glucose, 20 mm; KCl, 1 mm; pH 7.4). In transfection experiments, 5 μg of piGFP in combination with 5 μg of one of the G protein-containing plasmids were used, or 5 μg of pcGFP and 5 μg of pclacZ (positive control), or 10 μg pclacZ (nonfluorescent control). 106 cells and the DNA were mixed in the electroporator cuvette (gap width, 4 mm) and equilibrated on ice for 5 min. Cells were then electroporated using a Gene Pulser unit (Bio-Rad) that was set to 350 V, 100 μF (exponential decay), and immediately plated into 1 ml of prewarmed (37 °C) complete RPMI medium with human serum and GM-CSF or Epo plus SCF (for noninduced or induced cells, respectively). For the transfection of COS-1 cells, 105 cells in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were seeded into 35-mm dishes. After 24 h, the culture medium was replaced with Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cells were transfected with a total of 1 μg of plasmid DNA per dish using theN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammoniummethyl sulfate (Boehringer Mannheim) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested after 48 h, and the membrane fraction was analyzed by protein immunoblotting as described previously (26Baltensperger K. Porzig H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10151-10159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). MB-02 cells were washed three times and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (1 ml) supplemented with 22 mm glucose. Cells were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Laser excitation was at 488 nm (argon laser) for GFP, and emission was measured at 515–545 nm. The single color analysis was gated on forward scatter and side scatter. This gate contained all viable cells and excluded cell debris and cellular aggregates. A threshold for intensity of fluorescence was set high enough to exclude autofluorescence and was determined by running samples of untransfected and lacZ-transfected cells prior to the analysis. A total of 10,000 events was counted and analyzed for each sample using the CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). To correct for variability in transfection efficiencies from experiment to experiment, inducible GFP expression was normalized in each experiment to the average of fluorescent cells observed upon expression of GFP under the constitutively active CMV promoter, i.e. after transfection with pcGFP (three to four independent transfections per experiment). Statistical analyses were performed using the software packages StatView, version 4.02 for Macintosh (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA) or GraphPad Prism, version 2.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). We recently established several sublines of HEL cells that showed reduced expression of endogenous Gα16 protein after transfection with a plasmid harboring a full-length copy of Gα16 in antisense orientation (26Baltensperger K. Porzig H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10151-10159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In these sublines, mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ through activation of the P2Y2 (P2U) purinoceptor by UTP is impaired, whereas Ca2+-mobilization via other receptors is not or is only partially affected, demonstrating a specific functional defect (26Baltensperger K. Porzig H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10151-10159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Compared to controls with normal levels of Gα16, cellular growth was impaired in the Gα16-deficient sublines (Fig. 1). Population doubling times were significantly higher in the Gα16-suppressed cell lines 3D4 and 1E3 (41.4 ± 1.4 and 41.2 ± 1.6 h, respectively) than in the cell lines 9G10 and 7H6 expressing normal levels of Gα16 (34.8 ± 1.0, 33.2 ± 0.6 h, respectively) (mean ± S.E.). The results suggested that Gα16-mediated cellular signaling may be involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation. However, from these experiments, it could not be established whether Gα16-mediated inhibition of proliferation was associated with erythroid differentiation in hematopoietic cells, because the factor-independent HEL cells only partially differentiate in response to various inducers (31Papayannopoulou T. Nakamoto B. Kurachi S. Nelson R. Blood. 1987; 70: 1764-1772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hooper W.C. Pruckler J. Jackson D. Evatt B.L. Leukemia Res. 1991; 15: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To address this question, a factor-dependent cell line, MB-02, was chosen that can be readily differentiated along the erythroid pathway (27Morgan D.A. Gumucio D.L. Brodsky I. Blood. 1991; 78: 2860-2871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Broudy V.C. Morgan D.A. Lin L. Zsebo K.M. Jacobsen F.W. Papayannopoulou T. Blood. 1993; 82: 436-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MB-02 cells maintained in the presence of GM-CSF differentiate along the erythroid pathway upon withdrawal of GM-CSF and subsequent treatment with SCF and Epo (28Broudy V.C. Morgan D.A. Lin L. Zsebo K.M. Jacobsen F.W. Papayannopoulou T. Blood. 1993; 82: 436-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, the properties of the cell line corresponded to the ones described in the original literature: treatment for 10 days or longer with SCF/Epo resulted in a substantial proportion of cells that expressed hemoglobin, which was detected by benzidine staining (Fig. 2 A). An average of 45 ± 5% of cells expressed hemoglobin upon induction, whereas noninduced cells expressed detectable levels only in 6 ± 2% of the population (Fig. 2 B). MB-02 cells showed rapid growth in the presence of GM-CSF, whereas induction of differentiation with SCF/Epo led to a reduction in the population growth rate (Fig. 2 C). Withdrawal of GM-CSF resulted in massive cell death within 24 h, confirming their factor dependence (not shown), whereas withdrawal of SCF during the induction process,i.e. continuation of induction in the presence of Epo alone, resulted in a population that was almost stationary in its number of viable cells (Fig. 2 C). Under the latter condition, a higher proportion of cells expressed hemoglobin, but the overall viability of the population decreased sharply (not shown). Therefore, in our experiments, induction of cells was always performed in the presence of Epo and SCF. In order to study the effects of G protein overexpression in MB-02 cells, we used a transient transfection system to acutely manipulate G protein levels. As the transfection efficiency is low in hematopoietic cells, potential effects of such treatments could not be studied by biochemical or immunological methods. Thus, a reporter gene assay was established based on a plasmid that was co-transfected with the gene of interest. As a reporter for erythroid differentiation, the nucleotide sequence encoding GFP was placed under the control of the β-globin promoter in the original plasmid pEV3 (33Needham M. Egerton M. Millest A. Evans S. Popplewell M. Cerillo G. McPheat J. Monk A. Jack A. Johnstone D. Hollis M. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this reporter plasmid (piGFP), the β-globin promoter is located downstream of locus control region sequences derived from the human β-globin gene cluster (Fig. 3 A). In constructs bearing the locus control region-β-globin promoter arrangement, strong inducible expression from the β-globin promoter has been shown upon induction of differentiation in erythroid cells (33Needham M. Egerton M. Millest A. Evans S. Popplewell M. Cerillo G. McPheat J. Monk A. Jack A. Johnstone D. Hollis M. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, a plasmid (pcGFP) with constitutive expression of GFP under the control of the CMV promoter was constructed by splicing in CMV promoter sequences upstream of the GFP sequence (Fig. 3 B). In order to test whether the reporter plasmid was indeed capable of detecting erythroid differentiation, cells treated with GM-CSF (noninducing conditions) or with SCF/Epo (inducing conditions) were transiently transfected with piGFP or with the control plasmid pcGFP. Expression of GFP was then detected by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig.4 A, the relative number of GFP-expressing cells was 2.7-fold higher in SCF/Epo-treated cells than in GM-CSF-treated controls when normalized to GFP expression under the constitutively active CMV promoter. The relative number of differentiating cells as measured by the reporter assay reached a maximum after 11–14 days of induction (Fig. 4 B), consistent with previously published data on SCF/Epo-induced expression of globin proteins in this cell line (28Broudy V.C. Morgan D.A. Lin L. Zsebo K.M. Jacobsen F.W. Papayannopoulou T. Blood. 1993; 82: 436-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to quantify the extent of β-globin gene induction in differentiating cells, their fluorescence intensities resulting from the expression of the reporter gene construct were compared with that of noninduced cells. The histogram in Fig. 4 C shows an analysis in bins of 0.5 log units over the 4 log units of fluorescence intensities recorded by the FACScan. The first log unit of fluorescence (Fig. 4 C, bins 1 and2) represents autofluorescence as demonstrated by cells that were transfected with lacZ instead of the reporter gene construct. Overall, SCF/Epo-treated cells that were transfected with the reporter plasmid showed a 2.9-fold increase in their number of fluorescent cells contained in bins 3–8 when compared with noninduced cells (averages of 95.2 and 32.5 cells, respectively). The corresponding total fluorescence of induced cells was 4.3-fold higher than in noninduced cells (Fig. 4 C). Thus, SCF/Epo treatment resulted in a substantial increase in the number of fluorescent cells in the gated window (encompassing bins 3–8) but only in a slight increase of average fluorescence per cell (+48%), which is reflected by higher ratios of fluorescent cells appearing in bins 5–8 than in bins 3 and 4 (3.7, 4.5, 6.5, and 3.3 versus 2.7 and 2.1, respectively). Apparently, cells that undergo spontaneous differentiation under noninducing conditions (see also Fig. 2) show β-globin promoter activities almost equal to those of cells that were treated with SCF/Epo. Consequently, the number of fluorescent cells rather than gene expression levels on a per cell basis in the gated window was taken as a measure for erythroid induction. The results shown in Fig. 4 A indicate a ratio of differentiated cells of 46 ± 6% in SCF/Epo-treated cells. The reporter gene assay closely reflects the relative number of differentiated MB-02 cells, as detected by benzidine staining of cells after treatment with SCF/Epo (Fig. 2 B), which resulted in induction rates of 45 ± 5% of the population. However, it appears that the reporter assay is more sensitive than benzidine staining at lower levels of β-globin promoter activity: in noninduced cultures, 6 ± 2% of the cells were benzidine-positive, whereas 17 ± 1% of the cells showed increased fluorescence in the reporter assay (compare Figs. 2 B and 4 A). In COS-1 cells, transient transfection of pcGFP resulted in strong fluorescence, whereas no fluorescence was observed in cells transfected with piGFP (not shown). These results rule out the possibility that low levels of the reporter gene might have been expressed in the absence of activators of the β-globin promoter. Thus, the reporter system provides a valid and sensitive assay for monitoring erythroid differentiation in MB-02 cells. Using the reporter assay, we then examined the effect of G protein expression on β-globin promoter activation in nondifferentiated cells. Cells were co-transfected with the inducible reporter plasmid together with a plasmid encoding either wild-type Gα16 or the GTPase-deficient mutant of Gα16 (Gα16R186C). Cultures transfected with wild-type Gα16 showed a significant increase of GFP-expressing cells to 154% of levels observed in control cells transfected with pclacZ (Fig.5 A). Expression of the GTPase-deficient mutant of Gα16 led to an even higher proportion (195% of control) of transfected cells that showed β-globin promoter activity, which was also significantly higher than for the wild-type α-subunit. In order to test whether this effect was specific for Gα16 or resulted from the mere overexpression of G protein α-subunits, a GTPase-deficient mutant of Gαq, GαqR182C, was also expressed. Gαq represents the phylogenetically closest relative of Gα16, which also belongs to subfamily I of Gαq proteins (34Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In contrast to Gα16R186C, no induction was observed when GαqR182C was expressed (Fig. 5 B). Expression of a GTPase-deficient member of the more distant Gαifamily, Gαi2Q205L, resulted in a slight increase to 127 ± 19% (mean ± S.E.) of control values, which, however, was not significantly different from the control (not shown). Although from the same subfamily of G proteins, Gαq apparently is not able to functionally substitute for Gα16 in inducing differentiation of MB-02 cells. We previously observed that in HEL cells the P2U purinoceptor specifically couples to Gα16, leading to similarly exclusive Gα16-dependent signaling (26Baltensperger K. Porzig H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10151-10159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrate that the specificity of Gα16-dependent signal transduction is not limited to specificity in the receptor-G protein coupling but may also result from the interaction of Gα16 with downstream effector systems. The inducing effect of Gα16 appears to depend on functional activity of Gα16, because the GTPase-deficient mutant showed a significantly stronger induction than the wild-type form. The inability of Gαi2 and of Gαq to effectively induce β-globin promoter activity indicates that differentiation strictly depends on Gα16rather than being a general effect of G protein α-subunit overexpression. As HEL cells with suppressed Gα16 showed reduced growth rates (Fig. 1) but were not well suited to examine Gα16-dependent effects on cellular differentiation, MB-02 cells were also transfected with a Gα16 antisense-plasmid to down-regulate endogenous Gα16. Interestingly, transcription of antisense-RNA also significantly increased the number of GFP-positive cells to 156% of control values (Fig. 5 A). Since differentiation is associated with reduced rates of proliferation, this inducing effect of Gα16-down-regulation in MB-02 cells is consistent with its effect on proliferation that was detected in HEL cells (Fig. 1). However, the observation that either reducing or up-regulating the levels of Gα16 protein expression triggers differentiation may not easily be reconciled. Although this phenomenon has also been observed for acquiring functional competence of Jurkat T cells (18Lippert E. Baltensperger K. Jacques Y. Hermouet S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the underlying mechanism cannot be deduced from the available data and warrants further investigation. A cell-specific, optimal level of Gα16 activity seems to be required for proliferation, and any deviation from it will decrease growth rates and result in increased ratios of differentiating cells. Due to low transfection efficiencies, expression of Gα16 protein or antisense-dependent down-regulation of endogenous Gα16 could not be verified directly in MB-02 cells. Therefore, expression of Gα16 protein and its down-regulation through antisense RNA was verified by protein immunoblotting of solubilized membranes of transiently transfected COS-1 cells. Transfection with Gα16R186C or with wild-type Gα16 resulted in a single band with a relative mobility identical to the single immunoreactive band observed in membranes of MB-02 cells (Fig. 6). As expected, in COS-1 cells that were transfected with the control plasmid pclacZ, no immunoreactivity was detected, as these cells do not express endogenous Gα16. Transfection of smaller amounts of the Gα16 plasmid resulted in lower expression levels, indicating that under these conditions, plasmid-dependent protein expression was in a dynamic range, thus allowing for the detection of copy number-dependent alterations of expression. As shown in Fig. 6, co-transfection of Gα16with the Gα16 antisense construct resulted in a marked down-regulation of Gα16 expression when compared with controls that were transfected with Gα16 alone. A plasmid leading to a Gαi3 antisense RNA transcript was not capable of reducing the expression of Gα16, indicating specific interaction of the Gα16-transcript with Gα16 antisense sequences (Fig. 6, comparelanes G16WT+lacZ and G16WT+Gi3AS). The results suggest a causative role for a Gα16-dependent signaling pathway in the induction of differentiation in MB-02 cells. The identification of constitutively active, GTP-bound Gα16 as the active molecular entity suggests that in a natural environment, activation of Gα16 in response to receptor activation may indeed induce differentiation. This conclusion is supported by the results from the experimental up- or down-regulation of wild-type Gα16, which is expected to translate into changes in basal levels of GTP-bound Gα16, and consequently into changes of Gα16-dependent signaling activity. It is not known which receptors may engage Gα16 in MB-02 cells. Therefore, an assessment of the role of agonists that activate Gα16-coupled receptors is not yet possible. The observation that the GTPase-deficient Gα16 shows a higher efficacy than the wild-type form also excludes the possibility that Gα16 may act solely as a receptor-independent regulator of G protein signaling, e.g. by capturing βγ-subunits that might have been liberated by activation of other G proteins. Transfection of MB-02 cells with the Gα16R186C mutant resulted in a 1.9-fold increase of induced cells as compared with the number observed in control-transfected cells (Fig. 5 A). This increase is substantial in view of the 2.7-fold increase observed when cells were induced to differentiate by SCF/Epo (Fig. 4 A). Importantly, cells induced with SCF/Epo received the differentiating stimulus for 14 days, whereas transfected cells had to be scored after 3 days due to the transient nature of transfection. It was not possible to subject cells to transfection after 3 days of differentiation by SCF/Epo due to the fragile nature of the cultures at this time point. However, as demonstrated in Fig. 4 B, SCF/Epo treatment required several days to fully differentiate MB-02 cells. Thus, Gα16R186C—and deregulation of Gα16activity in general—may be considered as potent inducers of differentiation. In this context, it should be noted that our attempts to generate stable HEL cell lines transfected with Gα16R186C were not successful. It appeared that expression of constitutively active Gα16 inhibits proliferation in these cells to an extent that precluded the isolation of cell clones. Expression of the functionally similar GTPase-deficient mutant Gα16Q212L in nonhematopoietic cells apparently led to growth retardation, but stable cell lines could still be established (19Qian N.X. Russell M. Buhl A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17417-17423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gα16 may thus act as a much stronger (negative) regulator of proliferation in hematopoietic cells than in other cell lines. Whether this could be caused by a unique coupling of Gα16-dependent signaling to downstream effector systems or by stronger coupling to effector systems that are used by other members of the Gαq-family is not known. In conclusion, in hematopoietic cells an increase of Gα16function or its down-regulation have profound effects on proliferation and may cause erythroid differentiation in specific cell lines. It remains to be established whether differentiation along the erythroid pathway is specifically determined by Gα16 or whether Gα16 preconditions hematopoietic cells for differentiation independently of lineage determination. Deviations from optimal levels of Gα16 activity seem to be associated with acquiring functional competence by inducing either differentiation or activation of cellular proliferation, as seen in T-lymphocytes (18Lippert E. Baltensperger K. Jacques Y. Hermouet S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One might speculate that agonists employing Gα16-coupled receptors directly regulate the proportion of functionally competent cells. With the reporter assay based on transient transfection of cells and subsequent analysis by flow cytometry, it should now be possible to identify the Gα16-dependent signaling pathways involved in these processes. Furthermore, these studies could be extended to primary hematopoietic progenitor cells, in which G protein expression cannot be easily manipulated by other techniques. We are indebted to Dr. D.

Sequences responsible for both the mammary-specific expression of MMTV and the activation of cellular oncogenes are located within two enhancer elements at the 5′-end of the long terminal repeat.

The retrovirus is passed horizontally by ingestion of milk-borne infectious viral particles or vertically, in certain strains, via the inheritance of an active proviral copy (3Salmons B.

Integration of the provirus near the int genes results in the inappropriate expression of these cellular oncogenes and initiates events that lead to the formation of mammary tumors (5van Leeuwen F.

Entry into cells is achieved by the virion binding to a membrane receptor, which is expressed in many tissues (6Golovkina T.V. Dzuris J. van den Hoogen B. Jaffe A.B. Wright P.C. Cofer S.M. Ross S.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3066-3071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Low levels of MMTV RNA are detected in the epithelial cells from several tissues, such as salivary gland, lungs, kidney, and testes, as well as lymphoid tissue, but expression is approximately 500-fold higher in the lactating mammary gland (7Henrard D. Ross S.R. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3046-3049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MMTV LTR is widely used to direct the expression of transgenes to the mammary gland, but the basis for this specificity is not completely understood. The tissue specificity of MMTV expression is not due to its inducibility by steroid hormones. There are active and functional glucocorticoid receptors in most mouse tissues (8Gustafsson J.-A.

The 5′-end of the MMTV LTR contains enhancer elements that direct MMTV expression in a mammary-specific fashion (reviewed in Ref. 9Gunzburg W.H. Salmons B. Biochem.

Recently, we identified a second region in the 5′-end of the MMTV LTR that we termed the mammary-specific enhancer of MMTV (MEM element) (16Grimm S.L. Nordeen S.K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9428-9435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This element is important for both the mammary-specific expression of MMTV and the activation of cellular proto-oncogenes. Although the MEM element acts synergistically with the Ban2 enhancer in the MMTV LTR, multimerization of the MEM element itself can confer mammary cell-specific transcriptional activation (16Grimm S.L. Nordeen S.K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9428-9435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the MEM element is a composite element displaying at least three distinct footprinted domains that function synergistically. Deletion or mutation of individual binding sites decreases transcription from the MMTV promoter by up to 90% in mammary cells. Two of the domains are bound by ubiquitous factors, one of which is probably a member of the NF-1 family. At least one of the binding activities, corresponding to the protected region footprint I (FpI), appears to be restricted to mammary cells. However, multimerization of the FpI binding domain alone cannot activate transcription in mammary cells. Thus, it is the combination of multiple binding sites, one of which may be mammary-specific, that contributes to the mammary tropism of MMTV. The DNase I footprinting assay was performed as described by Dynan (17Dynan W.S. Setlow J.K. Hollaender A. Genetic Engineering, Principles, and Methods. 9. Plenum Press, New York1987: 75-87Google Scholar). A 215-bp fragment of the MMTV promoter encompassing −969 to −754 of the MMTV LTR was uniquely labeled at the 5′-end of the noncoding strand. Approximately 80,000 cpm of probe were incubated with increasing amounts of crude nuclear extracts and 2 μg of poly[d(I·C)] in a final reaction volume of 50 μl for 15 min on ice. Fifty μl of a solution containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 10 mmMgCl2 were added to each tube. A variable amount of DNase I was then added to each reaction and incubated for 1 min at room temperature. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 90 μl of stop solution (200 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA), extracted with phenol/chloroform, and ethanol-precipitated. DNA pellets were resuspended in 5 μl of 0.1n NaOH:formamide (1:2, v/v) containing xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue. The samples were boiled for 2 min, loaded onto a thin 8% urea polyacrylamide gel, and run in 1× TBE for ∼2 h at 1600 V. Following electrophoresis, the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Crude nuclear extracts were prepared from the cell lines listed in Table I according to the method of Dignamet al. (18Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9168) Google Scholar). Ten to 20 plates of cells (T-175 flasks or 15-cm diameter dishes) were grown to confluency and harvested to make each extract. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar). Typical yields ranged from 5–18 mg/ml. Extracts were aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C.Table ICell lines used to make nuclear extracts for EMSACell line/cell typeSpeciesI.

The chimeric LTR has GR sequences from −291 to +83 and C3H sequences from −1194 to −292 and from +84 to +99 Constructs with deletions in the MMTV LTR were made by cutting the vector with the indicated restriction enzymes, filling in the overhangs, and religating. A double-stranded 15-bp oligomer (TGAGGTGAATTCTAG) was inserted at the Bsu36I site to alter the spacing between the footprinted regions. The FpIIm and FpIIIm constructs were made by inserting 41-bp oligomers with the indicated base pair changes between the Bsu36I and ClaI sites. The Amersham Pharmacia Biotech U.S.E. site-directed mutagenesis kit was used to generate the FpI mutant constructs indicated in Fig. 2. All base changes described were confirmed by sequencing. To test enhancer activity, LTR sequences upstream of the basal MMTV promoter (−108 to +99) in the MMTV-CAT reporter plasmid were replaced by three or four copies of a fragment (−969 to −862) encompassing the MEM element. Alternatively, a 33-bp oligonucleotide containing only the FpI site was multimerized and cloned upstream of the basal MMTV promoter. Constructs that contained four or six wild-type copies of the FpI site and a construct with six mutant copies were chosen and confirmed by sequencing. Transient transfections were performed in T47D(A1–2) human breast cancer (20Nordeen S.K. Kuhnel B. Lawler-Heavner J. Barber D.A. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1270-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and Ltk− mouse fibroblast cell lines using the DEAE-dextran/Me2SO shock method, as described previously (16Grimm S.L. Nordeen S.K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9428-9435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In T47D(A1–2) cells, CAT reporter gene activity was normalized using pCH110, a plasmid expressing β-galactosidase from an SV40 promoter (21Hall C.V. Jacob P.E. Ringold G.M. Lee F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar), and in Ltk− cells using RSVL, a luciferase reporter gene driven by the Rous sarcoma virus LTR (22Gorman C.M. Merlino G.T. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Howard B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6777-6781Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 70 h after transfection for determination of protein concentration, CAT, β-galactosidase, and luciferase activity in the extracts (16Grimm S.L. Nordeen S.K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9428-9435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar, 23Nordeen S.K. Green P.P. Fowlkes D.M.

EMSA probes were labeled by filling in the 5′-overhangs with Klenow, [α-32P]dCTP, and cold nucleotides. A 20-μl reaction containing 15–25 μg of crude nuclear extract and 1–2 μg of poly[d(I·C)] was incubated for 15 min at 4 °C in binding buffer (50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.8 μg of gelatin, 1.3 mm dithiothreitol). In some cases, cold competitor was then added and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. Finally, labeled probe (30,000 cpm) was added to each reaction and incubated 15 min at 4 °C. The samples were loaded on a precooled 4% polyacrylamide gel and run in 0.25× TBE at 250 volts for 2 h at 4 °C. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. In our previous study (16Grimm S.L. Nordeen S.K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9428-9435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we identified a region in the 5′-end of the MMTV LTR that plays a role in the activation of cellular oncogenes, termed the MEM element. To begin to understand the mechanistic basis of the tissue specificity of MMTV, DNase I footprinting analysis was performed to identify protein binding sites in the MEM element (Fig. 1). Nuclear extracts from a human mammary carcinoma cell line (T47D) and a mouse fibroblast cell line (Ltk−) were compared. FpIII was the 3′-most binding site and contained a consensus NF-I binding site of TTGGCN5GCCAA (25Borgmeyer U. Nowock J. Sippel A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 4295-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). FpIII binding activity was seen with both mammary and fibroblast extracts. The next binding activity, FpII, was also seen with both extracts. This small footprint corresponded to a previously identified binding site for an uncharacterized activity. Despite the fact that the binding activity is present in both mammary and nonmammary cells, it has been termed mammary cell-activating factor (10Mink S. Hartig E. Jennewein P. Doppler W. Cato A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4906-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A difference in binding activity between mammary and fibroblast extracts was observed in the third protected region, FpI. Although the protection was present most clearly with the T47D nuclear extracts, there was partial protection of this region using Ltk− extracts. However, the footprint seen with the mammary extracts was accompanied by a DNase I hypersensitive site. Thus, the MEM element is composed of multiple binding sites, one of which appears to bind a tissue-restricted, if not mammary-specific, factor. In order to determine the functional significance of the three binding sites delineated by footprinting analysis, a series of deletions and mutations were introduced into the MMTV LTR (Fig.2 A). These MMTV-CAT constructs were transiently transfected into either T47D(A1–2) or Ltk− cells to test their transcriptional activity. The largest deletion (Δ76), which removed 76 bp that included FpII, FpIII, and much of the FpI region, had the greatest effect, virtually ablating the basal expression of MMTV in mammary cells. This same deletion had no effect on transcription in fibroblast cells (compare Fig. 2 B with Fig. 2 C). Deletion of either much of FpI (ΔBB, −938 to −903) or of FpII/III (ΔBC, −903 to −862) resulted in a loss of promoter activity in mammary cells, suggesting that all three binding sites may be necessary for transcriptional activity. This speculation was confirmed by making clustered point mutations in the three binding sites individually to assess the contribution of each subdomain. A 5-bp change in the FpIII binding site reduced activity of the MMTV promoter in mammary cells by 70%, and a 3-bp change in FpII/mammary cell-activating factor site reduced activity by 60% (Fig.3 B). A series of mutations along the FpI site (FpI mut 1–4) resulted in 50–80% reductions of promoter activity. The spatial arrangement of the three binding sites of the MEM element is also critical for their functional synergy. A 15-bp oligonucleotide was inserted at the Bsu36I site separating FpI from FpII/III by 1.5 turns of the DNA helix while leaving the binding sites intact. This alteration in spacing resulted in a 70% drop in promoter activity. It appears that all three binding sites are needed, intact and in the correct context, in order to achieve mammary-specific transcription. In the context of the MMTV LTR, the MEM element acts in synergy with the Ban2 element (16Grimm S.L. Nordeen S.K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9428-9435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the MEM element on its own is sufficient to enhance transcription, three or four copies of the enhancer were placed upstream of a minimal MMTV promoter (Fig.3 A). The minimal promoter (ΔSst) had no activity in T47D(A1–2) cells. A single MEM element had little effect on this promoter. However, adding back three or four copies of the MEM element rendered the minimal promoter 5–10 times more active than the full-length MMTV LTR in mammary cells (Fig. 3 B). In fibroblast cells (Fig. 3 C), there was no change in the transcriptional activity of any of the constructs. These data support the hypothesis that the MEM element is a key determinant in the mammary-specific expression of MMTV. Studies on the hormonal regulation of MMTV have provided many of the insights that have shaped the current understanding of what is now termed “classical” hormone response elements. MMTV has a well characterized cluster of hormone response elements located between −80 and −200 in the MMTV LTR (26Scheidereit C. Geisse S. Westphal H.M. Beato M. Nature. 1983; 304: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) that mediate the prodigious induction of promoter activity resulting from exposure to the appropriate steroid hormones. We wanted to test whether the MEM element was involved in the hormone responsiveness of the MMTV LTR. The constructs diagrammed in Fig. 2 A were transiently transfected into T47D(A1–2) and Ltk− cells and treated with 40 nm dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, for 20 h before harvest. As shown in Fig. 4, none of the deletions or mutations in the MEM element significantly affected the hormone response of MMTV in either cell type. Thus, the MEM element is necessary for the basal transcription of MMTV but is not involved in the hormone response. To confirm the mammary-specific nature of the FpI-binding protein, a panel of nuclear extracts from 20 different cell lines (TableI) were tested for FpI binding activity. The extracts were bound to a probe containing the FpI binding site, and the resultant EMSA is shown in Fig. 5. Three DNA-protein complexes were formed with T47D extracts. Complex 1 was present in five of eight mammary extracts. In contrast, the complex was not found in any of 12 extracts from nonmammary cells both epithelial and nonepithelial in origin. Complex 2 was seen with all the extracts, and the mobility of a third, faster migrating complex (complex 3) varied among different extracts and was not always present. The presence of more than one EMSA complex using a FpI probe explains the partial footprinting seen using Ltk− fibroblast extracts (Fig. 1). However, there is a mammary-restricted binding activity associated with the FpI protected region, corresponding to complex 1. Next, probes containing the four different FpI mutations (mut1–4) were used to test for FpI binding (Fig.6 A). Compared with a wild-type FpI sequence, none of the four mutants were able to bind complex 1 well. Additionally, mut2 did not form complex 2, and mut3/mut4 could not form complex 3. Because all four mutations lead to a reduction in the transcriptional activation by the MEM element (Fig. 2 B), complex 1 exhibits the best correlation between FpI binding activity and transcriptional activity. In order to determine the specificity of binding to the FpI probe, a competition EMSA was performed with a variety of competitor DNAs (Fig.6 B). A 10-fold molar excess of cold wild-type FpI oligonucleotide efficiently competed for binding of all the complexes. The FpI mutants could only compete for binding of the complexes they formed in Fig. 6 A. Thus, mut2 was unable to compete well for complex 2 binding, and neither mut3 nor mut4 could compete for complex 3. The FpI mutants, with the exception of mut1, could not compete for complex 1 very efficiently. Two unrelated oligonucleotides could not compete for the binding of any of the complexes, demonstrating the specificity of the nuclear extracts for binding the FpI sequences. To test whether the FpI binding region was itself sufficient to activate transcription in mammary cells, reporter gene constructs containing either a wild-type or mutant 35-bp oligonucleotide spanning the FpI binding site were multimerized and cloned upstream of a minimal MMTV promoter (Fig.7 A). As before, the minimal MMTV promoter (ΔSst) showed almost background levels of transcriptional activity in T47D(A1–2) cells (Fig. 7 B). Adding back four or six copies of the wild-type FpI binding site failed to enhance the activity of the minimal promoter further. Therefore, the FpI domain requires the other domains of the MEM element to enhance transcription in mammary cells, even though the FpI domain alone appears to have mammary cell-specific binding activity. The sequence of the FpI binding site shows similarity to the consensus binding sequence for the C/EBP family of transcription factors, including two CAAT-box motifs (Fig. 8 A). A set of reciprocal competition gel shift assays revealed some similarities between FpI binding and C/EBP binding. EMSA experiments using T47D nuclear extracts and either a 33-bp FpI probe or a 20-bp C/EBP probe were performed and a 50-fold molar excess of competitor DNA was added. In Fig.8 B, both the 33-bp FpI oligonucleotide and a shorter 21-bp FpI oligonucleotide competed for binding to the FpI probe (lanes 2 and 3). Interestingly, a C/EBP binding site was also able to efficiently compete for the binding of complex 1 and partially for complex 2 (Fig. 8 B, lane 4). The binding was specific, as a mutant C/EBP oligonucleotide could not compete for the complexes (lane 5). When a C/EBP binding site was used as a probe, both FpI oligonucleotides competed for binding almost as well as the C/EBP oligonucleotide (lanes 7–9). Again, binding to the C/EBP probe was specific because a mutant C/EBP binding site did not compete for the complexes (lane 10). These findings raise the possibility that a C/EBP family member contributes to the mammary-specific expression of MMTV and are discussed more fully below. The 5′-end of the MMTV LTR is responsible for both the mammary-specific expression of the virus and the activation of cellular oncogenes (16Grimm S.L. Nordeen S.K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9428-9435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that MMTV induces tumors primarily in the mammary gland appears to be linked with mammary-specific expression of the virus. A number of binding sites for nuclear proteins have been reported in this region of the LTR. These fall within two regions defined as having mammary-specific transcriptional activity: the Ban2 enhancer and the MEM element. When the MEM element is multimerized upstream of a minimal MMTV promoter, it can enhance transcription in a mammary-specific fashion. Similar experiments with the Ban2 enhancer show that it, too, can enhance transcription on its own (10Mink S. Hartig E. Jennewein P. Doppler W. Cato A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4906-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 15Kusk P. John S. Fragoso G. Michelotti J. Hager G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31269-31276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, we have shown that inactivation of either the Ban2 enhancer or the MEM element in the context of the LTR abrogates both the MMTV promoter and its ability to activate a nearby proto-oncogene promoter (16Grimm S.L. Nordeen S.K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9428-9435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the Ban2 and the MEM elements function synergistically when contained in a full-length LTR. The Ban2 enhancer contains binding sites for four different proteins, including AP-2, an Ets-related factor, a member of the CTF/NF-I family, and an uncharacterized factor mp4 (11Lefebvre P. Berard D.S. Cordingley M.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Mellentin-Michelotti J. John S. Pennie W.D. Williams T. Hager G.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31269-31276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The Ban2 fragment (−1075 to −978) upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter is active only in mammary cells and not in HepG2 liver cells (10Mink S. Hartig E. Jennewein P. Doppler W. Cato A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4906-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Mellentin-Michelotti J. John S. Pennie W.D. Williams T. Hager G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31983-31990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 180-bp fragment (−1166 to −987) containing this enhancer can also target a transgene to the mammary gland of mice when linked to the SV40 promoter (27Mok E. Golovkina T.V. Ross S.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7529-7532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even when present as a single copy and independent of the MEM element, the Ban2 enhancer was able to direct mammary-specific transcription. This may be because the Ban2 enhancer is separated from the negative regulatory elements contained in the full-length MMTV LTR, or due to the use of a stronger heterologous promoter, rather than the very weak MMTV basal promoter. However, there were higher levels of transgene expression when the Ban2 and MEM elements were both present (10Mink S. Hartig E. Jennewein P. Doppler W. Cato A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4906-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The MEM element has only recently been recognized as a distinct functional element (16Grimm S.L. Nordeen S.K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9428-9435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have now characterized the functional interplay of the binding sites within the MEM element that constitute the active, tissue-specific enhancer. DNase I footprinting analysis revealed three protected regions within this element in extracts from T47D mammary carcinoma cells (Fig. 1). All three sites contribute to the mammary-specific expression of the virus. Deletions that removed one, two, or all three of the binding sites reduced transcriptional activity by 85–96%, and base substitutions in individual sites reduced transcriptional activity by 50–80%. These results with the MEM element contrast with the Ban2 enhancer, in which clustered point mutations in all four binding sites were required to reduce the activity by 80% (14Mellentin-Michelotti J. John S. Pennie W.D. Williams T. Hager G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31983-31990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spatial context of the MEM element binding sites with respect to one another is also important. When the three binding sites are left intact but a 15-bp insertion is introduced, the LTR can no longer support transcription in mammary cells. Thus, not only are all three binding activities of the MEM element important for the mammary-specific expression of MMTV, it may be that physical interaction between the factors or a common coactivator is required for MEM element activity. In dissecting the MEM element, we have focused on the FpI protected region, because DNase I footprinting analyses revealed a difference in binding activity in extracts from T47D mammary carcinoma cells and fibroblasts. EMSA studies indicated three activities in T47D cell extracts that bound a FpI oligonucleotide. In order to be certain that there was a mammary-specific binding activity associated with the FpI factor, we assayed the binding activity of nuclear extracts from 20 cell lines representing mammary carcinomas, nontumor mammary epithelium, nonmammary epithelial cells, and nonepithelial cells (TableI). Complex 1 was found exclusively in mammary cells and was present in the majority of the mammary lines examined. A second complex, complex 2, was found in all cell types. Finally, a third, faster migrating complex was present in many cases, but its mobility varied depending on the cell line. Four different clustered point mutations within the FpI binding site decreased MEM element activity. Complex one correlated best with this functional data, as it was the only one of the three complexes of which the binding was decreased by all four mutations. The FpI region cannot mediate mammary-specific transcription on its own, however, even in multiple copies. When the FpI binding site is multimerized upstream of a minimal MMTV promoter and separated from other two MEM element-binding proteins, there is no increase in transcriptional activity in a mammary cell line. Thus, the MEM element behaves as a composite enhancer, the function of which is dependent on functional synergy between tissue-specific (or at least tissue-restricted) and nonspecific factors. The binding of multiple transcription factors to a composite enhancer element to allow cell-type specific transcription has been observed in a number of tissues, including the mammary gland, liver, lymphoid cells, heart, and muscle (28Rosen J.M. Zahnow C. Kazansky A. Raught B. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1998; 63: 101-113PubMed Google Scholar, 29Xanthopoulos K.G. Mirkovitch J. Eur. J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9366-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). This combinatorial effect circumvents the requirement for tissue-specific transcription factors and instead mediates tissue-restricted gene expression by combining both ubiquitous and tissue-enriched transcription factors in a novel way. No factor specific to the mammary gland has been identified, although a couple of binding proteins were named for that putative property. Mammary gland factor is identical to Stat5 and is expressed in many tissues (33Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Mammary gland factor/Stat5 does, however, mediate the prolactin signal and is important for the expression of milk proteins, such as β-casein and whey acidic protein (28Rosen J.M. Zahnow C. Kazansky A. Raught B. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1998; 63: 101-113PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a functional Stat5 binding site has been identified in the middle portion of the MMTV LTR and is important for the mammary-specific expression of MMTV (34Qin W. Golovkina T.V. Peng T. Nepomnaschy I. Buggiano V. Piazzon I. Ross S.R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 368-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mammary cell-activating factor was found to be a member of the Ets family of transcription factors and is not restricted to the mammary gland (35Welte T. Garimorth K. Philipp S. Jennewein P. Huck C. Cato A.C. Doppler W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Its activity has not been well characterized, but because of such a binding site in the Ban2 enhancer, it does play some role in the mammary-specific regulation of MMTV. Fig.9 outlines the binding sites located within the two enhancer elements in the 5′-end of the MMTV LTR. Of the eight binding sites, six binding activities are found in both mammary and nonmammary cells. The uncharacterized mp4 factor was reported to show binding activity in mammary cell lines only (11Lefebvre P. Berard D.S. Cordingley M.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the FpI complex 1 binding activity was shown to be restricted to mammary cell lines in this study. We found that the FpI region binds ubiquitous factors as well. An earlier study (10Mink S. Hartig E. Jennewein P. Doppler W. Cato A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4906-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) that termed this region F4 observed nonspecific binding activities but not a mammary-specific complex as we have seen. Because we did not see the mammary-specific complex (complex 1) in all mammary cell lines, this may explain the discrepancy. The competition EMSA data (Fig. 8) raise the interesting possibility that the FpI-binding protein may be a member of the C/EBP family of transcription factors (36Wedel A. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.

The 3′-half of the binding site is well conserved, and it has been documented that C/EBP binding sites may show significant homology to only one half of the palindrome (37Lamb P. McKnight S.L.

Three of the six isoforms, C/EBP α, β, and ∂, are expressed in the mouse mammary gland and are important for its development and function (38Doppler W. Welte T. Philipp S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17962-17969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 39Seagroves T.N. Krnacik S. Raught B. Gay J. Burgess-Beusse B. Darlington G.J. Rosen J.M.

C/EBP β is important for the mammary-specific expression of β-casein and whey acidic protein, in conjunction with other ubiquitous transcription factors, such as Stat5, YY1, NF-I, and the glucocorticoid receptor (28Rosen J.M. Zahnow C. Kazansky A. Raught B. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1998; 63: 101-113PubMed Google Scholar). Although the sequence of the FpI binding site, along with EMSA data, is consistent with a member of the C/EBP family, other data weigh against this conclusion. In contrast to the marked heat stability characteristic of C/EBP proteins, the FpI binding activity is heat labile at temperatures above 37 °C. When nuclear extracts were heated to 60 °C for 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 min and used in EMSA analysis, the extracts retained the ability to form a complex with a C/EBP probe but not with a FpI probe (data not shown). Furthermore, the inclusion of antibodies against C/EBP α, C/EBP β, or C/EBP ∂ neither upshifted any of the complexes binding an FpI oligonucleotide nor disrupted the complexes. Finally, none of these three forms of C/EBP exhibit a cell-type distribution as restricted as does the complex 1 binding activity. Initial attempts to enrich for complex 1 binding and study its biochemical properties have been hampered by its apparent lability to extensive manipulation. Our previous results and the results from this study firmly establish the importance of the MEM element in the mammary-specific expression of MMTV. Further experiments to characterize the poorly defined binding activities of the mammary-specific MEM and Ban2 elements need to be carried out. It will be critical to determine whether the FpI and mp4 factors binding these elements are truly restricted to the mammary gland and whether, at least in the case of FpI, it is related to the C/EBP family of transcription factors. It is apparent that a complex interaction of many transcription factors in a combinatorial fashion is required to allow the mammary-specific expression of MMTV. The mechanism by which combinatorial interactions are translated into tissue-specific, developmentally appropriate activity is a key question in the regulation of transcription."
