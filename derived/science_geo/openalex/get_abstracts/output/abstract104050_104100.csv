https://openalex.org/W2048472525,"We report cDNA cloning and characterization of the human and mouse orthologs of the chicken YAP (Yes-associated protein) gene which encodes a novel protein that binds to the SH3 (Src homology 3) domain of the Yes proto-oncogene product. Sequence comparison between mouse, human, and chicken YAP proteins showed an inserted sequence in the mouse YAP that represented an imperfect repeat of an upstream sequence. Further analysis of this sequence revealed a putative protein module that is found in various structural, regulatory, and signaling molecules in yeast, nematode, and mammals including human dystrophin. Because one of the prominent features of this sequence motif is two tryptophans (W), we named it the WW domain (Bork, P., and Sudol, M. (1994) Trends Biochem. Sci. 19, 531-533). Since its delineation, more proteins have been shown to contain this domain, and we report here on the widespread distribution of the WW module and present a discussion of its possible function. We have also shown that the human YAP gene is well conserved among higher eukaryotes, but it may not be conserved in yeast. Its expression at the RNA level in adult human tissues is nearly ubiquitous, being relatively high in placenta, prostate, ovary, and testis, but is not detectable in peripheral blood leukocytes. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization on human metaphase chromosomes and by analyzing rodent-human hybrids by Southern blot hybridization and polymerase chain reaction amplification, we mapped the human YAP gene to chromosome band 11q13, a region to which the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 gene has been mapped.

One of the hallmarks of signal transduction processes is a specific physical interaction between proteins carried out by well demarcated and structured regions of the proteins, which are called domains(1Pawson T.

Our research has focused on molecular steps by which non-receptor-type protein-tyrosine kinases of the Src family signal in normal and transformed cells(4Sudol M. Neel B. Kumar R. The Molecular Basis of Human Cancer. Futura Publishing Co., Inc., Armonk, NY1993: 203-224Google Scholar). In recent years, much of the attention has been concentrated on amino-terminal domains of protein-tyrosine kinases. At least three distinct structural domains, termed SH2, SH3 (SH for Src homology) and PH (for pleckstrin homology) are present in the non-receptor-type protein-tyrosine kinases and are also found in a wide variety of proteins implicated in signal transduction processes(5Musacchio A.

The SH2 domains are known to interact specifically with phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, and the resulting complexes are involved in signal transduction events initiated by protein-tyrosine kinases(1Pawson T.

Cell. 1992; 71: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain of Src protein-tyrosine kinases is not only involved in substrate recognition but is also necessary for the regulation of kinase activity through maintenance of a repressed conformation of the protein-tyrosine kinases(10Kanner S.B.

For Src and other members of the family, it is presumed that binding of specific proteins to their SH3 domains may result in the modulation of their enzymatic activity and thus could be a part of the signaling mechanism of cellular and oncogenic forms of the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases(22Kato J.Y.

The PH domain was first defined as two repeats in pleckstrin, the major substrate for serine/threonine phosphorylation by protein kinase C in platelets(7Haslam R.J. Kolde H.B. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 309-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 8Mayer B.J. Ren R. Clark K.L. Baltimore D. Cell. 1993; 73: 629-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In contrast to SH3 and SH2, the PH domain seems to bind a nonproteinaceous ligand, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, implicating this domain in membrane-protein interaction(30Harian J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Recently, we have identified, cloned, and characterized the cDNA for a novel chicken protein that binds to the SH3 (Src homology 3) domain of the Yes proto-oncogene product(31Sudol M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2145-2152PubMed Google Scholar). The protein has a molecular mass of 65 kilodaltons (kDa) and is phosphorylated in vivo on serine. We named it YAP65 for Yes-associated protein of 65 kDa. Within the YAP65 (YAP for short) sequence, we identified a proline-rich motif that is involved in binding YAP to Yes kinase. YAP was also shown to bind to other signaling molecules that contain SH3 domains including Nck, Crk, and Src. In order to analyze the function of YAP in transgenic animals, we have cloned mammalian orthologs of chicken YAP. Two interesting findings resulted from our studies. First, the sequence comparison between mouse, human, and chicken YAPs showed an inserted sequence in mouse YAP representing an imperfect repeat of an upstream sequence. Unexpectedly, this sequence showed significant similarity with various regulatory and signaling molecules, and we have proposed that it may form a novel domain involved in protein-protein interaction(32Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 531-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In this report, we show the widespread occurrence of this domain and point out new signaling molecules that contain the WW module. Second, the human YAP (hYAP) gene was localized to a short interval on chromosome 11q13 that harbors a gene for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. We have also shown that the hYAP gene is well conserved among higher eukaryotes and is expressed in most tissues. A chicken YAP cDNA corresponding to the coding region (31Sudol M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2145-2152PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a probe to screen a λpCEV15 cDNA library derived from M426 human lung embryonic fibroblast cells (a gift from Dr. Stuart Aaronson, Ref. 33Miki T. Matsui T. Heidaran M.A. Aaronson S.A. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 83: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and a 16-day mouse embryo cDNA library in λ EXlox™ (purchased from Novagen, Madison, WI). The low stringency conditions of hybridization were as follows: 5 × SSPE, 10 × Denhardt's, 2% SDS, 0.2 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 106 cpm/ml 32P-labeled cDNA at 65°C overnight. The filters were washed twice for 20 min at room temperature with 2 × SSC, 0.05% SDS, and twice at 60°C for 20 min with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. Both libraries contained phages with a plasmid portion that carried the insert. The plasmids with inserts were easily rescued from the λ genome following published protocols(33Miki T. Matsui T.

The apparently complete sequence of the hYAP cDNA was contained in one recombinant plasmid pCEV15-hYAP6 with a SalI-SalI insert of 5 kb1 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s)BCL1B cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 human locusCCND1cyclin D1 human locusFISHfluorescence in situ hybridizationYAPYes-associated protein of 65 kilodaltons from chicken, also named YAP65hYAPhuman Yes-associated proteinmYAPmouse Yes-associated proteinMAPmicrotubule-associated proteinMEN1multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1PHpleckstrin homologySHSrc homologyUTRuntranslated regionWtryptophanwwwworld wide web. pairs. The complete sequence of mouse YAP (mYAP) cDNA was contained in two overlapping clones, pEXlox-mYAP6 (2.3-kb EcoRI-HindIII insert) and pEXlox-mYAP20 (EcoRI-HindIII insert). Both strands of the cDNA clones were analyzed by direct sequence analysis using the Sanger method(35Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Southern blot of genomic DNA from nine eukaryotic species was performed using the same conditions as for cDNA library screening(36Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). DNA sources were as follows: human, rhesus monkey, Sprague-Dawley rat, BALB/c mouse, dog, cow, rabbit, chicken, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Except for yeast and human DNAs, all other genomic DNAs were isolated from kidney tissue. Human DNA was isolated from placental tissue. DNA was digested with EcoRI, run on a 0.7% agarose gel, transferred to a charge-modified nylon membrane by blotting, and fixed by UV irradiation. The cDNA insert of the hYAP5 plasmid or human β-actin cDNA control probe were radioactively labeled to a specific activity of approximately 2 × 108 cpm/μg and were used as a probe for Southern (hYAP probe) and for Northern analysis (hYAP probe was used first, and, after stripping, the probe for β-actin was used). Poly(A)+ RNAs were isolated from 16 different human tissues from healthy donors of both sexes (Clontech Laboratory Inc.). The RNAs (2 μg/lane) were run on a denaturing formaldehyde-1.2% agarose gel, transferred to a charge-modified nylon membrane by blotting, and fixed by UV irradiation. The hybridization conditions were: 5 × SSPE, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml freshly denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA, 50% formamide, and 2% SDS at 42°C overnight(36Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). The blots were washed for 30 min at room temperature in 2 × SSC, 0.05% SDS and for 1 h at 50°C in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. Removal of the hYAP probe from the blot for subsequent hybridization with the human β-actin probe was achieved by incubating the blot for 10 min in sterile H2O containing 0.5% SDS that was heated to 90°C. For Southern blot hybridization, the hYAP cDNA insert (hYAP6 clone) was isolated and radiolabeled by random priming to a specific activity of 108 cpm/0.1 μg, and 108 cpm was used for each filter hybridization; for FISH, the entire hYAP cDNA was labeled with biotin by nick translation (36Ausubel F.M.

Druck T. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Genes Chrom. Cancer. 1993; 7: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Hybrid DNAs were from previously described rodent-human hybrid cell lines (37Huebner K.

A. 1986; 83: 6568-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or from the NIGMS Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Coriell Institute, Camden, NJ). Hybrids retaining partial chromosomes 11 and 6 have also been described(38Lou Z. Kastury K. Crilley P. Lasota J. Druck T. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Genes Chrom. Cancer. 1993; 7: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 39Nagarajan L. Louie E. Tsujimoto Y. Balduzzi P.C. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6568-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Hybrid DNAs were tested for the presence of YAP specific human SstI and PstI restriction fragments detected by radiolabeled hYAP probe using standard Southern hybridization methods. In addition, oligonucleotide primers were prepared for amplification of a 208-bp fragment of the hYAP 3′-untranslated region (UTR) representing nucleotides 2135 through 2341. The forward primer, an 18-mer starting at position 2135 of the cDNA sequence, was 5′GGAAATGGCCACTGCAGA3′, and the reverse primer, a 20-mer starting at position 2323, was 5′CCCTAAGCTAAAGCTAATCT3′. These primers were used to amplify the hYAP 3′-UTR fragment from mouse, hamster, human, and hybrid DNAs under the following cycling conditions: 94°C, 5 min for denaturation; 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s; and a final cycle at 72°C for 5 min. The procedure used in this study has been described in detail(38Lou Z. Kastury K. Crilley P. Lasota J. Druck T. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Genes Chrom. Cancer. 1993; 7: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Probes were prepared by nick translation using biotin-labeled 11-dUTP (BioNick Kit, Life Technologies, Inc.). Hybridization of biotin-labeled probes was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin. Metaphase chromosomes were identified by Hoechst-33528 staining and UV irradiation (365 nm), followed by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining to produce the banding pattern. The fluorescent signal was observed with filter block I3 (BP450-490/LP515; Leitz Orthoplan) on the background of red chromosomes stained with propidium iodide. Q-banding was observed with filter block A (BP340-380/LP430). Analyses of sequence homology and secondary structures of the polypeptides were performed as described previously (40Koonin E.V. Bork P.

Using a cDNA fragment encoding the chicken YAP as a probe, we screened λ phage plaques of a human lung embryonic fibroblast cDNA library. Of 13 positive clones, two (hYAP5 and hYAP6) with the longest inserts (approximately 3 and 5 kb long, respectively) were analyzed further. Initial analysis of the DNA sequence showed that hYAP5 cDNA is included within the hYAP6 clone. The result of direct sequence analysis of both strands of the hYAP6 cDNA is shown in Fig. 1. The longest open reading frame predicted a protein product of 493 amino acids with significant sequence similarity to the chicken YAP (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Alignment of the human (HYAP), mouse (MYAP) and chicken (YAP) YAP amino acid sequences. Positions that differ in at least one amino acid are indicated in bold. Spaces in the alignment were introduced arbitrarily and are indicated with dots. The sequences corresponding to the putative WW domain are underlined. Note that in mYAP a second WW domain is present. Proline-rich sequences implicated in binding between YAP and various SH3 domains are conserved and indicated with a number sign.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In parallel experiments, we isolated a mouse ortholog of YAP using the same chicken YAP cDNA as a probe. We screened a mouse embryo (16 day) cDNA library in the λ EXlox vector. Of 7 positive clones, 2 (mYAP6 and mYAP20) were shown to contain long inserts (approximately 2.3 and 3.6 kb long, respectively); the clones overlapped giving rise to a 4-kb-long cDNA sequence terminating with a poly(A) stretch. As for the hYAP, the longest open reading frame predicted a protein product with significant sequence similarity to the chicken YAP. However, an additional sequence of 38 amino acids was present in the middle of the sequence (Fig. 2). Visual inspection of the insert sequence suggested that it is an imperfect duplication of a sequence found upstream (see underlined sequences in Figure 1:, Figure 2:). We have subjected this sequence to more detailed analysis and found that the motif shares significant sequence and structural similarities with sequences found in various regulatory and signaling proteins(32Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 531-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Alignment of the chicken YAP, mYAP, and hYAP also revealed long stretches of amino acid sequences that were perfectly conserved (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the proline-rich sequence (Fig. 2, indicated with a number sign), implicated in binding chicken YAP to the SH3 domain of Yes, is 100% conserved among the three sequences. A high degree of sequence similarity between hYAP, mYAP, and chicken YAP was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of the genomic DNAs digested with EcoRI enzyme (Fig. 3). Genomic DNA from other higher eukaryotes also showed hybridization with the hYAP radioactive probe. However, no specific signal was detected in yeast S. cerevisiae. A major transcript of approximately 5 kb was detected by Northern blot in various human tissues. An additional band migrating below 2.4 kb was detected in some of the tissues (see Fig. 4, lanes K, M, and O for example). The expression of hYAP mRNA is relatively high in placenta, prostate, testis, ovary, and small intestine (Fig. 4, lanes C, K, L, M, and N). Relatively lower levels of the message were found in the brain, liver, and spleen (Fig. 4, lanes B, E, and I). We could not detect hYAP mRNA in the preparation of human peripheral blood leukocytes even on overexposure of the blot (Fig. 4, lane P). The hYAP cDNA detected two loci, one on chromosome 11 (11q13) and another on chromosome 6 (6q23-qter). When human DNA was digested with SstI restriction enzyme and probed with radioactive hYAP cDNA, two strongly hybridizing bands, one of 16 kb pairs and another migrating above 23 kb pairs, were detected (not shown). In addition, we also observed less strongly hybridizing bands. In the same analysis, rodent DNA digested with SstI and probed with hYAP cDNA showed fainter bands distinguishable from the hYAP specific fragments (not shown). When DNAs from a panel of rodent-human hybrids, each carrying a few human chromosomes, were tested for the presence of the hYAP locus, it was observed that the two strongly hybridizing bands segregated independently and thus were on different chromosomes (not shown). The results of the analysis of the rodent-human hybrid panel are summarized in Fig. 5A. These data illustrate that one hYAP specific locus maps to chromosome 11q and the other to chromosome 6. The less strongly hybridizing bands did not seem to segregate with either of the two major bands. The locus on chromosome 11q was the most intensely hybridizing band and was thus presumed to represent the cognate hYAP gene. In order to demonstrate that the 11q locus was indeed the locus of the cognate gene, oligonucleotide primers flanking an approximately 200-bp region of the 3′-UTR (cDNA positions 2135-2341, inclusive of primers) were synthesized and used in polymerase chain reaction amplification with mouse, hamster, human, and hybrid DNAs as templates. Amplification products were detected after electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. No product was amplified from rodent DNAs or from DNA hybrids containing human chromosome 6 without chromosome 11, hybrid Nu9 for example. The expected 200-bp fragment was observed after amplification from DNA templates derived from human or hybrids retaining chromosome 11 but not 6, hybrids 734 and 7298 for example (data not shown). These data suggest that the chromosome 6 locus represents a YAP-related locus rather than a pseudogene. To further define the chromosome positions of these loci, small panels of DNAs from hybrids carrying partial chromosomes 11 or 6 were also tested for the presence of the YAP loci with the results summarized in Fig. 5B. Because the hYAP cognate locus was present in hybrid 7298 but absent in hybrid CE4, the gene maps between the centromere and the CCND1/BCL1 locus on chromosome 11, whereas the hYAP-related locus maps to 6p21 to 6qter. To confirm and refine the above localizations, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with the hYAP cDNA probe was performed on normal human metaphase chromosomes. Using FISH, we detected 51 signals at chromosome 11q13 on 27 metaphases and only 12 signals on the q-terminal one-third of chromosome 6. The FISH results are summarized to the left of the chromosome idiograms shown in Fig. 5B. Since the hYAP gene was mapped to 11q13, centromeric to the BCL1 major breakpoint region, possibly within the chromosomal region which is amplified in a significant fraction of human mammary carcinomas, a panel of 17 mammary carcinoma cell line DNAs was tested for evidence of amplification of the hYAP gene. Four of these DNAs had shown amplification of the CCND1/BCL1 gene (from 3- to 10-fold), but none showed evidence of an amplified hYAP gene (data not shown). Thus, the hYAP gene is most likely centromeric to the chromosome region commonly amplified at 11q13 in mammary carcinomas. The presence of an extra sequence in the murine YAP as compared to the human and chicken orthologs focused our attention on this motif and led us to propose it as a new protein module, the WW domain(32Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 531-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The domain appears to contain β-strands grouped around four conserved aromatic positions (Fig. 6). Two of these positions are most frequently occupied by tryptophans, hence the name, the WW domain. Other important features of the domain are a high content of polar amino acids and the presence of prolines distributed preferentially toward both termini of the linear sequence. One of the carboxyl-terminal prolines at the seventh amino acid from the end is invariably conserved (Fig. 6). The length of the WW domain was set at 38 residues, which corresponds to the length of the second WW motif (the insert) identified in the mouse ortholog of YAP (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the sequence similarity among WW domains ends rather abruptly beyond the 38 amino acids. If indeed the 38 amino acids of the WW motif compose a structured domain, the size would be relatively small compared with the SH2, SH3, or PH domain. There are two other features of the WW motif which also suggest a protein module. As with the SH3 domain, the WW sequence occurs frequently in multiple repeats within the same molecule: from two repeats in mouse YAP, for example, to four repeats in the human homolog of Nedd-4 (Fig. 7). In addition, most of the proteins that contain the WW motif(s) also contain other functional domains, either catalytic or structural (e.g. Rsp5 and 38D4, see “Discussion”).Figure 7:Modular structure of proteins containing the WW domains. The WW domain is indicated by a black box. The C2 domain is shared with some forms of protein kinase C, synaptotagmins, and C. elegans Unc-13 protein; the HECT domain is found at the carboxyl termini of Rsp5, E6-AP, UreB1, Nedd4, a hypothetical yeast protein (Ykbo), and 56G7 protein from C. elegans, and it encodes ubiquitin-protein ligase activity (58-60); other catalytic domains shown are: Ras-GTPase activator-like domain; breakpoint cluster region homology domain that is shared with Grb-1, n-chimaerin, and other signaling molecules (48Boguski M.S.

In the present study, GH is shown to stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the principle substrate of the insulin receptor. Tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 is a critical step in insulin signaling and provides binding sites for proteins with the appropriate Src homology 2 domains, including the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3′-kinase. In 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, GH-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 was detected by 1 min and at GH concentrations as low as 5 ng/ml (0.23 nM). Tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 was transient, with maximal stimulation detected at 30 min and diminished signal detected at 60 min. The ability of GH receptor (GHR) to transduce the signal for IRS-1 tyrosyl phosphorylation is mediated by the intracellular region of GHR between amino acids 295 and 380 by a mechanism not involving the two tyrosines in this region. This region of GHR is required for GH-dependent JAK2 association and activation (VanderKuur, J. A., Wang, X., Zhang, L., Campbell, G. S., Allevato, G., Billestrup, N., Norstedt, G., and Carter-Su, C.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 21709-21717). When other cytokines that activate JAK2 were tested for the ability to stimulate the tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1, stimulation was detected with interferon-γ and leukemia inhibitory factor. The correlation between JAK2 tyrosyl phosphorylation and IRS-1 tyrosyl phosphorylation in response to GH, interferon-γ, and leukemia inhibitory factor and in cells expressing different GHR mutants, provides evidence that IRS-1 may interact with JAK2 or an auxiliary molecule that binds to JAK2. GH is also shown to stimulate binding of IRS-1 to the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI 3′-kinase. The ability of GH to stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 and its association with PI 3′-kinase provides a biochemical basis for responses shared by insulin and GH including the well characterized insulin-like metabolic effects of GH observed in a variety of cell types.

https://openalex.org/W1988126373,"N-Linked glycosylation usually occurs at the sequon, Asn-X-Ser/Thr. In this sequon, the side chain of the hydroxy amino acid (Ser or Thr) may play a direct catalytic role in the enzymatic transfer of core oligosaccharides to the Asn residue. Using recombinant variants of rabies virus glycoprotein (RGP), we examined the influence of the hydroxy amino acid on core glycosylation efficiency. A variant of RGP containing a single Asn-X-Ser sequon at Asn37 was modified by site-directed mutagenesis to change the sequon to either Asn-X-Cys or Asn-X-Thr. The impact of these changes on core glycosylation efficiency was assessed by expressing the variants in a cell-free transcription/translation/glycosylation system and in transfected tissue culture cells. Substitution of Cys at position 39 blocks glycosylation, whereas substitution of Thr dramatically increases core glycosylation efficiency of Asn37 in both membrane-anchored and secreted forms of RGP. The substitution of Thr for Ser also dramatically enhances the level of expression and cell surface delivery of RGP when the sequon at Asn37 is the only sequon in the protein.

Novel forms of membrane-anchored and secreted RGP which are fully glycosylated at all three sequons were also generated by substitution of Thr at position 39. One of the most common types of protein modification is N-linked glycosylation, in which oligosaccharides are added to specific Asn residues(1Hubbard S.C. Ivatt R.J. Annu. Rev.

N-Linked glycosylation plays a critical role in the expression of most cell surface and secreted proteins in eukaryotes by promoting their delivery to the cell surface or extracellular space. N-Linked glycosylation may also be required for protein stability, antigenicity, or biological function(3Varki A.

Despite the importance of N-linked glycosylation, little is known about the protein signals which control the efficiency of oligosaccharide addition at specific Asn residues. The tripeptide sequence (or sequon) asparagine-X-serine or asparagine-X-threonine (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) is generally required for N-linked glycosylation(7Marshall R.D. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1974; 40: 17-26PubMed Google Scholar). In this sequon, X can be any amino acid, although proline (Pro) is rarely found at this position(8Mononen I. Karjalainen E. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1993; 268: 12706-12712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further characterization of the protein signals which regulate N-linked glycosylation at specific sequons is essential for understanding natural glycoprotein synthesis and for facilitating recombinant protein design. A number of studies have compared the amino acid sequences of glycoproteins in order to identify protein signals which influence core glycosylation. Those studies suggest that the amino acid at the hydroxy position of a sequon (i.e. Ser or Thr) may influence the likelihood of glycosylation at that site, since Asn-X-Thr sequons are glycosylated two to three times more often than Asn-X-Ser sequons(6Kaplan H.A.

Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Studies using peptides as oligosaccharide acceptors in membrane preparations also demonstrate a greater acceptor activity of peptides containing an Asn-X-Thr sequon than peptides containing an Asn-X-Ser sequon(25Bause E. Legler G. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the polymerase chain reaction-based method, splicing by overlap extension (27Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R.

The Ser at position 39 of RGP(1-) was replaced with either Thr or Cys to generate plasmids RGP(1-)T39 and RGP(1-)C39, respectively. For this mutagenesis, the codon TCA (Ser39) was changed to ACA (Thr) or to TGT (Cys). In both cases, a PvuII site near sequon 1 was deleted by a single nucleotide substitution to facilitate screening of recombinant plasmids; this latter mutation did not alter the amino acid sequence. The amplified products containing the desired mutations were digested with HindIII and XhoI to generate a 422-base pair fragment, which was ligated into the HindIII and XhoI sites of RGP(1-), replacing the corresponding sequence (14Shakin-Eshleman S.H.

The resulting plasmids were isolated following transformation into Escherichia coli HB101 and were screened by restriction enzyme analysis. The full HindIII-XhoI insert in each plasmid was analyzed by DNA sequencing to confirm the presence of the desired mutations and the absence of unwanted base changes introduced during polymerase chain reaction amplification. Additional plasmids containing Thr at position 39 were generated by subcloning the HindIII-XhoI fragment of RGP(1-)T39 into the corresponding position of RGP(WT), RGP(1-)T434,2 2To avoid any confusion it should be noted that throughout this paper T434 indicates truncation of the protein at residue 434, whereas T39 represents threonine at position 39. and RGP(WT)T434 to generate plasmids RGP(WT)T39, RGP(1-)T434T39, and RGP(WT)T434T39, respectively. RNA encoding RGP variants was generated by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro translation was performed using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system supplemented with [35S]methionine and dog pancreas microsomes, and translation products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described(14Shakin-Eshleman S.H.

Genet. 1984; 18: 525-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), as described previously (14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding RGP(1-)C39 and RGP(1-)T39 were co-transfected with the selectable plasmid, pSV2Neo(29Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar), into Lec 1 cells using a polybrene method(30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.47Google Scholar). G418-resistant colonies were amplified and screened for expression of the encoded proteins by indirect immunofluorescence of fixed cells using the mouse monoclonal anti-rabies antibody 80-6(31Smith J.S. Sumner J.W. Roumillat L.F. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1984; 19: 267-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Colonies expressing the encoded proteins were subcloned by a single round of limiting dilution. Transient transfection of plasmids into Lec 1 cells was performed using a DEAE-dextran method as described previously(14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For metabolic labeling, 80-90% confluent 100-mm dishes of cells expressing each RGP variant were washed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution. Cells were preincubated at 37°C for 2 h in complete medium (14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing 50 μg/ml castanospermine (Genzyme Corp., Cambridge, MA), washed three times with Hank's balanced salt solution, and then incubated at 37°C for 4 h with 5 ml of methionine-free α-minimal essential medium containing 50 μCi of [35S]methionine and 50 μg/ml castanospermine. Cell lysates were prepared essentially as described(14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that cells were resuspended and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 200 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were precleared by incubation with protein A beads shaking for 16 h at 4°C. Radiolabeled RGP-related proteins were immunoprecipitated from precleared cell lysates by adding polyclonal anti-rabies antiserum at a 1:100 dilution and shaking for 1 h at 4°C. Immune complexes were isolated by adding protein A beads and shaking for 1 h at 4°C. Protein A beads were then washed, and immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted into sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously(14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface expression of RGP-related proteins was examined by indirect immunofluorescence of live cells as described previously(14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The secondary antibody used for staining was affinity-purified, fluorescein-conjugated, goat anti-mouse Ig (Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC) which was diluted 1:50 in α-minimal essential medium and precleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. Intracellular expression of RGP proteins was examined by indirect immunofluorescence of cells following fixation and permeabilization. Cells grown on glass coverslips were rinsed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), fixed, and permeabilized with methanol:acetone (1:1) for 5 min at −20°C, and air-dried. Indirect immunofluorescent staining of fixed cells was performed at room temperature. Cells were preincubated for 1 h in PBS containing 5% goat serum (GS). Culture supernatant containing the primary mouse monoclonal anti-RGP antibody 80-6 was precleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min, diluted with an equal volume of PBS, and supplemented with GS at a final concentration of 5%. Cells were incubated with the primary antibody preparation for 45 min and then washed three times for 10 min each in PBS containing 5% GS and 1% Triton X-100. The secondary goat anti-mouse antibody described above was diluted to a final concentration of 1:100 in PBS containing 5% GS. Cells were incubated with the secondary antibody preparation for 45 min, washed three times as described above, rinsed in PBS, mounted in PBS:glycerol (1:1), and examined by epifluorescence and phase contrast microscopy. The monoclonal antibodies used for staining of live cells included 509-6 and 523-11 from The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, and 80-6, 36-6, 111-6, and 105-2, which were generously provided by J. Smith from the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA. In the studies described below, RGP is used as a model glycoprotein to study the influence of the hydroxy amino acid on core glycosylation efficiency. RGP from the ERA strain is a 505-amino acid type 1 transmembrane protein with three Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequons for N-linked glycosylation at Asn37 (sequon 1), Asn247 (sequon 2), and Asn319 (sequon 3) (Fig. 1A, RGP(WT); Refs. 32Anilionis A. Wunner W.H. Curtis P.J. Nature. 1981; 294: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar and 33Wunner W.H. Larson J.K. Dietzschold B. Smith C.L. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1988; 10: S771-S784Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding this protein was previously subcloned into the pSG5 vector to generate a plasmid encoding RGP(WT) (34Burger S.R. Remaley A.T. Danley J.M. Moore J. Muschel R.J. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We previously generated a variant of RGP(WT) with a single sequon at Asn37 by replacing the Thr in sequons 2 and 3 with Ala (Fig. 1B, RGP(1-); Ref. 14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this study, additional variants were generated from RGP(1-), in which the Ser in sequon 1 was replaced with Thr or Cys by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1B, RGP(1-)T39 and RGP(1-)C39, respectively). To analyze the influence of the hydroxy amino acid on core glycosylation efficiency, we expressed RGP variants in a cell-free transcription/translation/glycosylation system. RNA was generated from plasmids by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase and was translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system supplemented with [35S]methionine and canine pancreas microsomes(14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that this system removes the amino-terminal signal sequence from RGP and adds N-linked core oligosaccharides(14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Translation products were separated by gel electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography (Fig. 2). Expression of RGP(1-) in the cell-free system in the absence of microsomes yields a major product which represents the unglycosylated protein with the amino-terminal signal sequence attached (Fig. 2, lane A; Ref. 14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of microsomes, expression of RGP(1-) yields two products (Fig. 2, lane B), which we have shown previously represent the unglycosylated protein with the signal sequence removed (lower band) and the protein glycosylated with a single core oligosaccharide (upper band; Refs. 14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 26Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9465-9472Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Expression of RGP(1-)C39, which contains the sequence Asn-X-Cys at Asn37, yields only the unglycosylated product (data not shown), indicating that sequon 1 is not glycosylated when cysteine is present at the hydroxy position; this result was expected, since Asn-X-Cys sequences are rarely glycosylated. Remarkably, expression of RGP(1-)T39 yields predominantly the glycosylated product (Fig. 2, lane C); this demonstrates that the single, conservative amino acid substitution of Thr for Ser at the hydroxy position of a sequon can dramatically up-regulate the efficiency of oligosaccharide addition. Previous studies have suggested that the presence or absence of a membrane anchor can influence the core glycosylation of sequons in some proteins(20Guan J. Machamer C.E. Rose J.K. Cell. 1985; 42: 489-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the core glycosylation efficiency of sequons in RGP is not affected by removal of the membrane anchor(26Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9465-9472Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We extended those studies by examining whether the influence of the hydroxy amino acid on the core glycosylation of sequon 1 was also observed when the membrane anchor of RGP was removed. To examine this, we generated additional variants of RGP which contain stop codons at position 434, immediately upstream of the membrane anchor (Fig. 1A, arrow). We found that substitution of Thr for Ser at sequon 1 up-regulated core glycosylation at Asn37 in a variant truncated at position 434, analogous to the effect seen in the full-length, membrane-anchored protein (data not shown). We next examined the influence of the hydroxy amino acid on the core glycosylation efficiency of sequon 1 in transfected tissue culture cells. To do this, plasmids encoding RGP(1-)C39 and RGP(1-)T39 were stably transfected into Lec 1 CHO cells. Transfected cells were screened by indirect immunofluorescence for expression of RGP proteins, and cell lines expressing each protein were subcloned by limiting dilution. To analyze core glycosylation of the RGP variants in the transfected cells, we blocked the processing of core oligosaccharides which normally occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. This processing is partially blocked in the Lec 1 cell line due to a deficiency in GlcNAc-T1 transferase(28Stanley P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 525-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To completely block processing, cells were incubated before and during metabolic labeling with castanospermine, an inhibitor of glucosidases I and II(35Elbein A.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 497-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that castanospermine blocks the processing of core oligosaccharides on RGP under these conditions(14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell lines expressing RGP(1-)T39 and RGP(1-)C39 were analyzed in parallel with previously isolated, stably transfected Lec 1 cells expressing RGP(1-) and RGP(−3)(14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and with untransfected Lec 1 cells as a control. RGP(−3), which contains a single sequon at Asn37, was shown in previously studies to be fully glycosylated in these cells(14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following metabolic labeling of each cell line with [35S]methionine, RGPs were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using a polyclonal anti-rabies antibody and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that RGP(1-) is inefficiently glycosylated in the transfected cells (Fig. 3, lane C), whereas RGP(−3) is fully glycosylated (Fig. 3, lane E), consistent with results from our previous studies(14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RGP(1-)C39, which contains an Asn-X-Cys sequon at Asn37, was not isolated following immunoprecipitation of cell lysates (Fig. 3, lane B). In contrast, we find that the single amino acid substitution of Thr for Ser at sequon 1 in the variant RGP(1-)T39 dramatically increases the efficiency of core glycosylation in the transfected cells (Fig. 3, lane D); this result is consistent with the efficient glycosylation of the Asn-X-Thr sequon in this variant in the cell-free system. We demonstrated previously that RGP is normally expressed at high levels on the surface of transfected CHO cells and that cell surface expression requires glycosylation of at least one sequon in the protein(14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, those studies suggested that the level of cell surface RGP expression reflects the efficiency of core glycosylation of the protein when only one sequon is present(14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine further the role of glycosylation on RGP expression, we compared the cell surface expression of RGP(1-)C39 and RGP(1-)T39 to that of RGP(1-) and RGP(WT) in the stably transfected cell lines. This was first assessed by examining cells following fixation and permeablization (Fig. 4). As shown previously, RGP(1-) is barely detectable in the transfected cells, whereas RGP(WT) is expressed at high levels(14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We find that RGP(1-)C39 is detectable at a low level similar to that of RGP(1-). In contrast, RGP(1-)T39 is detected at a level comparable to that of RGP(WT). This demonstrates that the single amino acid substitution of Thr for Ser in sequon 1 dramatically increases the expression of RGP(1-). To assess the impact of the hydroxy amino acid on cell surface delivery of RGP, we examined the transfected cells following indirect immunofluorescent staining of live cells (Fig. 5). As shown previously, RGP(1-) is detectable at low levels at the surface of live cells, whereas RGP(WT) is expressed at high levels(14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to RGP(1-), RGP(1-)C39 is not detected on the cell surface; this finding is consistent with the lack of glycosylation of this protein as observed in the cell-free system and with the dependence of RGP on glycosylation for cell surface transport(14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Burger S.R. Remaley A.T. Danley J.M. Moore J. Muschel R.J. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, we find that RGP(1-)T39 is detected on the cell surface at levels comparable with that of RGP(WT), demonstrating that the single conservative amino acid substitution of Thr for Ser at sequon 1 dramatically increases the cell surface expression of this protein. Similar results were obtained when CHO cells were examined following transient transfection with the same plasmids (data not shown). To assess whether RGP(1-)T39 retains conformational features of RGP(WT), we compared the immunofluorescent staining of live cells expressing RGP(1-)T39 and RGP(WT) with a panel of six anti-RGP monoclonal antibodies (see “Materials and Methods”). In each case, the staining of RGP(1-)T39 was comparable with that of RGP(WT) (data not shown). Our previous studies demonstrate that the full-length, wild-type protein, RGP(WT), and a secreted variant of this protein, RGP(WT)T434, are inefficiently glycosylated at sequon 1 and are efficiently glycosylated at sequons 2 and 3(14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9465-9472Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We next examined whether introduction of the sequon, Asn-X-Thr, into RGP(WT) could be used to generate a novel form of RGP with full glycosylation at all three sequons. To do this, we generated a variant of RGP(WT) which contained the substitution of Thr for Ser at sequon 1 (Fig. 1A, RGP(WT)T39). Expression of RGP(WT) in the cell-free system yields a major protein product with two core oligosaccharides and a minor protein product with three core oligosaccharides, as described previously (Fig. 2, lane D; Ref. 14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, RGP(WT)T39, which contains Thr at the hydroxy position of sequon 1, is fully glycosylated at all three sequons (Fig. 2, lane E). This result indicates that efficient glycosylation at sequon 1 (resulting from the presence of Thr at position 39) does not interfere with the efficient core glycosylation at sequons 2 and 3. Similar results were obtained using secreted variants of these proteins, RGP(WT)T434 and RGP(WT)T434T39 (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that the substitution of Thr for Ser at sequon 1 can be used to generate novel forms of RGP with full glycosylation at all three sequons. A variety of factors have been shown to influence the core glycosylation of sequons in glycoproteins. These include changes in the amino acid sequence near an Asn residue(36Hasegawa M. Orita T. Kojima T. Tomonoh K. Hirata Y. Ochi N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), deletion or addition of other sequons in the protein(37Grinnell B.W. Walls J.D. Gerlitz B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9778-9785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Rau S. Geyer R. Friedrich R.W. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and alterations in the position of a sequon relative to the NH2 or COOH terminus of a protein (26Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9465-9472Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 39Livi G.P. Lillquist J.S. Miles L.M. Ferrara A. Sathe G.M. Simon P.L. Meyers C.A. Gorman J.A. Young P.R.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11362-11456Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) or to the membrane anchor(41Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Core glycosylation efficiency can also be influenced by factors which do not affect the primary structure of the protein. For example, core glycosylation efficiency can be modulated by alterations in protein folding in cell-free systems(42Bulleid N.J. Bassel-Duby R.S. Freedman R.B. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), by the growth conditions of cultured cells (13Curling E.M.A. Hayter P.M. Baines A.J. Bull A.T. Gull K. Strange P.G. Jenkins N. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), or by the type of cells used for protein expression(43Morimoto K. Kawai A. Mifune K. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This study examines the influence of the hydroxy amino acid in an Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequon on the regulation of core glycosylation efficiency. Previous studies have found that Asn-X-Thr sequons are more likely to be glycosylated than Asn-X-Ser sequons in proteins(6Kaplan H.A. Welply J.K. Lennarz W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 9Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). However, those studies do not consider the effect of the hydroxy amino acid on the efficiency of core glycosylation of sequons which are glycosylated. Other studies using presynthesized peptides as oligosaccharide acceptors demonstrate that peptides containing Asn-X-Thr sequons are glycosylated more efficiently than peptides containing Asn-X-Ser sequons and that Asn-X-Cys sequons in peptides can serve as weak oligosaccharide acceptors(25Bause E. Legler G. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This effect of the hydroxy amino acid on core glycosylation has been explained by a catalytic model, in which the hydroxy amino acid actively participates in oligosaccharide transfer through a series of hydrogen bond transfer reactions involving oligosaccharyltransferase, the hydroxy amino acid side chain, and the β-amide group of asparagine(25Bause E. Legler G. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Studies of peptides containing Thr derivatives further demonstrate that alterations of the hydroxy amino acid side chain which impact on local stereochemistry can interfere with enzymatic transfer of the core oligosaccharide(44Bause, E., Warmuth, R., Wesemann, M., (1989) Tenth International Symposium on Glycoconjugates (Sharon, N., Lis, H., Duksin, D., Kahane, I., eds) September 10-15, Jerusalem, Israel.Google Scholar). The studies in this report provide additional support for this model by directly demonstrating that substitution of Thr for Ser at an inefficient Asn-X-Ser sequon in an intact protein can up-regulate the efficiency of core glycosylation at that site. This effect is observed using both a cell-free system and transfected tissue culture cells to examine the co-translational core glycosylation efficiency of these recombinant proteins. This amino acid substitution is highly conservative and is unlikely to induce a major change in protein conformation. In fact, our immunofluorescence analysis using a series of anti-RGP monoclonal antibodies reveals that recombinant proteins with this amino acid substitution are displayed on the surface of transfected cells in a fashion similar to that of the wild-type protein. We do not detect glycosylation of RGP(1-)C39 in the cell-free system. This is not surprising, since Asn-X-Cys sequons are rarely glycosylated (9Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) and are relatively poor oligosaccharide acceptors (25Bause E. Legler G. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The inability to isolate RGP(1-)C39 from cell lysates following immunoprecipitation may refect inappropriate folding, destabilization, or aggregation of the protein; this could result from a lack of glycosylation. An unglycosylated RGP variant which lacks all three sequons is also not detectable in stably transfected cells under these conditions(14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also possible that the presence of Cys at position 39 blocks glycosylation indirectly by altering disulfide bonding in RGP; altered disulfide bonding could also cause misfolding, destabilization, or aggregation of the protein(45Doms R.W. Lamb R.A. Rose J.K. Helenius A. Virology. 1993; 193: 545-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Two other Cys residues are present at the amino terminus of RGP, at positions 24 and 35(32Anilionis A. Wunner W.H. Curtis P.J. Nature. 1981; 294: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar); those residues are predicted to be present in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen when Asn37 is available for glycosylation and could interact with the Cys residue at position 39. Similar interactions have been found to impair glycosylation in other proteins; in interleukin-6, inefficient glycosylation at Asn46 was attributed to a conformational constraint on the sequon due to disulfide bonding between Cys45 and Cys51(36Hasegawa M. Orita T. Kojima T. Tomonoh K. Hirata Y. Ochi N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The possibility that Cys39 in RGP impairs glycosylation by disulfide bonding, rather than a direct effect on core glycosylation, is somewhat less likely, since substitution of Cys at position 38 did not inhibit, and actually enhanced core glycosylation at Asn37 (data not shown). Our findings suggest that the amino acid at the hydroxy position of a sequon should be considered in the design of novel sequons in recombinant proteins. In particular, our findings suggest that Asn-X-Thr is generally a more efficient sequon than Asn-X-Ser and should be used whenever possible to maximize the likelihood of efficient glycosylation. Studies in which novel sequons are introduced into recombinant proteins by genetic engineering often do not provide information about the hydroxy amino acid at the glycosylation sites. However, in a series of studies which provide this information, we find that 92% () of novel Asn-X-Thr sequons were glycosylated, in contrast to only 57% () of novel Asn-X-Ser sequons(15Machamer C.E.

By altering the hydroxy amino acid at sequon 1 in RGP, we have generated novel forms of RGP which are fully glycosylated at all three sequons. This demonstrates that efficient core glycosylation at sequon 1 does not impair the efficient core glycosylation of sequons 2 and 3. This lack of interaction between sequons which we observe in RGP has also been observed in ovalbumin(46Sheares B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12778-12782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In other proteins, altering the glycosylation at one sequon in a protein does appear to impact on the glycosylation of other sequons(37Grinnell B.W. Walls J.D. Gerlitz B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9778-9785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Rau S. Geyer R. Friedrich R.W. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Therefore, effects of sequon interaction must be determined in individual proteins on a case by case basis. The novel forms of RGP generated in this study may provide further information about the role of site-specific glycosylation of RGP in rabies virus infection. Previous analysis of RGP isolated directly from viral particles of the ERA strain (used in the present study) and the challenge virus standard strain had not detected glycosylation at sequon 1(47Dietzschold B. J. Virol. 1977; 23: 286-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Wunner W.H. Dietzschold B. Smith C.L. Lafon M. Golub E. Virology. 1985; 140: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, our studies clearly demonstrate a potential for this site to be glycosylated at low levels in both cell-free systems and transfected cells. The failure to detect RGP glycosylated at all three sequons in viral particles may reflect a relationship between glycosylation at Asn37 and the instability of RGP, trimerization, or inefficient intracellular transport of RGP in infected cells or the assembly of RGP into viral particles. This is of interest, since glycosylation of RGP may influence not only cell surface transport of the protein(14Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol.

It is interesting to note that the sequon at Asn37 and the surrounding amino acid sequence is highly conserved among different strains of rabies virus (51Benmansour A. Brahimi M. Tuffereau C.

Virol. 1994; 135: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Moreover, this region of RGP (amino acids 29-41) appears to serve as an epitope for viral recognition by T-helper cells(53Otvos L.

This accumulation of amyloidogenic carboxyl-terminal fragments is specific, since there is relatively little effect of Aβ1-42 on the amount of the nonamyloidogenic α-secretase carboxyl-terminal fragment. The amyloidogenic fragments accumulate in the same nonionic detergent-insoluble fraction of the cell that contains the internalized Aβ1-42. Western analysis indicates that a subset of the amyloidogenic fragments react with antibodies that recognize a conformation of Aβ that is specifically associated with aggregated forms of Aβ, suggesting that the adoption of this aggregation-related conformation may be an early event which precedes the final processing that produces Aβ. Pulse-chase analysis of the [35S]Met-labeled 16-kDa amyloidogenic fragment indicates that it is relatively stable in Aβ1-42-treated cells, with a half-life of approximately 50 h. This fragment is degraded with a half-life of 30 min in control cells treated with Aβ1-28. In contrast, the turnover of the nonamyloidogenic α-secretase product is not significantly altered by the presence of Aβ1-42. The continuous uptake of Aβ1-42 from the medium is not required for the stimulation of amyloidogenic fragment accumulation, suggesting that the presence of intracellular Aβ1-42 aggregates establishes a new pathway for APP catabolism in cells which leads to the long term stability of the fragments. If these amyloidogenic fragments of APP ultimately give rise to Aβ, then the production of Aβ may be an autocatalytic, “runaway” process in cells containing Aβ1-42 nuclei. It is conceivable that the accumulation of insoluble APP and amyloidogenic fragments of APP in response to Aβ1-42 aggregates may mimic the pathophysiology of dystrophic neurites, where the accumulation of intracellular APP and APP fragments has been documented by immunohistochemistry.

https://openalex.org/W2077250354,"ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) is an essential N-myristoylated 21-kDa GTP-binding protein with activities that include the regulation of membrane traffic and phospholipase D activity. Both the N terminus of the protein and the N-myristate bound to glycine 2 have previously been shown to be essential to the function of Arf in cells. We show that the bound nucleotide affects the conformation of either the N terminus or residues of Arf1 that are in direct contact with the N terminus. This was demonstrated by examining the effects of mutations in this N-terminal domain on guanosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) and GDP binding and dissociation kinetics. Arf1 mutants, lacking 13 or 17 residues from the N terminus or mutated at residues 3-7, had a greater affinity for GTPγS and a lower affinity for GDP than did the wild-type protein. As the N terminus is required for interactions with target proteins, we conclude that the N terminus of Arf1 is a GTP-sensitive effector domain.When Arf1 was acylated, the GTP-dependent conformational changes were codependent on added phospholipids. In the absence of phospholipids, myristoylated Arf1 has a lower affinity for GTPγS than for GDP, and in the presence of phospholipids, the myristoylated protein has a greater affinity for GTPγS than for GDP.

This was first demonstrated when Arf·GTPγS was found to be active as a cofactor for cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gs, whereas Arf·GDP was inactive(6Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Cell. 1992; 70: 69-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), are also highly dependent on the binding of GTP or the slowly hydrolyzable analog GTPγS. Similarly, Arf·GTP was found to have at least a 50-fold greater affinity for Arf GTPase-activating protein than did Arf·GDP(18Randazzo P.A. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10758-10763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, as is true for many, if not all, regulatory GTP-binding proteins, the nucleotide bound has been shown to regulate the affinity of Arf for target proteins.The specific domains of Arf that interact with target proteins, referred to as effector domains, have not yet been identified. Two criteria have previously been used to define effector domains in other GTP-binding proteins. The conformation of the effector domain should be sensitive to bound nucleotide. For instance, comparison of Ras·GDP and Ras·GTP crystal structures has revealed differences in two regions, referred to as switch 1 and switch 2(19Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). In addition, certain mutations in the effector region should allow uncoupling of GTP binding and increased binding of target proteins. In Ras, switch 1 also meets this criterion, identifying this as an effector domain(19Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Based on data from previous studies, the N-terminal domain of Arf has been implicated as an effector domain. Deletion of the N-terminal 13 or 17 amino acids results in proteins that can bind GTP but that are inactive as cofactors for cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gs(9Kahn R.A. Randazzo P.

Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29490-29494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These mutant proteins also have decreased affinity for Arf GTPase-activating protein(10Randazzo P.A. Terui T. Sturch S. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29490-29494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the N terminus meets one of the criteria used to define the effector domain in Ras.A critical aspect of Arf action in cells appears to be its regulated binding to and release from different intracellular membranes(7Donaldson J.G.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 869-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Residues located immediately C-terminal (positions 3-7) are also critical determinants in whether or not a protein is a substrate for N-myristoyltransferase(23Rocque W.J. McWherter C.A. Wood D.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9964-9971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As several of the putative Arf effectors in cells (e.g. phospholipase D and Gs) are membrane-bound, it is important to distinguish between changes in the ability of Arf to associate with membranes and changes in its ability to interact with effectors.We present evidence that the conformation of the N-terminal domain (or residues in direct contact with the N terminus) of Arf1 depends on the bound nucleotide. Because the affinity of Arf1 for GTP is lower than that for GDP, the conformational changes accompanying GTP binding must consume a large part of the binding energy. Therefore, deleting or mutating a domain that undergoes the GTP-dependent conformational change should reciprocally affect GTP and GDP binding affinities. In contrast, any change in the nucleotide-binding site itself is likely to affect binding of GDP and GTP similarly. As mutations in the N terminus caused an increased GTP affinity and a decreased GDP affinity, we conclude that the N terminus forms at least part of the GTP-sensitive switch. We also demonstrate that N-myristoylation is the predominant factor responsible for regulation of nucleotide binding by phospholipids.MATERIALS AND METHODSProteinsRecombinant Arf1, [Δ17]Arf1 (Arf1 with amino acids 1-17 deleted), and [Δ13]Arf1 (Arf1 with amino acids 1-13 deleted) were prepared as described previously(9Kahn R.A. Randazzo P. Serafini T. Weiss O. Rulka C. Clark J. Amherdt M. Roller P. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13039-13046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Randazzo P.A.

The N-terminal mutants [6,7SK]Arf1 (Arf1 in which residues Ala6 and Asn7 are replaced by Ser6 and Lys7) and [3-7LFASK]Arf1 (Arf1 in which wild-type residues Asn3-Ile-Phe-Ala-Asn7 are replaced by Leu3-Phe-Ala-Ser-Lys7, as found at residues 3-7 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Arf1) were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the human Arf1 coding region with sense primers that include the desired mutations and incorporating an NdeI site at the initiating methionine codon and with an antisense primer that adds a BamHI site 6 base pairs 3′ of the stop codon. The resulting open reading frame was subcloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET3C vector and transfected into BL21(DE3) cells as described(24Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol.

Yeast (S. cerevisiae) N-myristoyltransferase expression was achieved in BL21(DE3) cells using plasmid pBB171 (the generous gift of Dr. Jeffrey I. Gordon, Washington University, St. Louis, MO)(27Duronio R.J. Jackson-Machelski E. Heuckeroth R.O. Olins P.O. Devine C.S. Yonemoto W. Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Human N-myristoyltransferase expression was achieved with a similar plasmid, pNMT1, which contains the entire open reading frame in an ≈1.6-kilobase BglII-EcoRI fragment cloned into the same sites of pBB131 (the human N-myristoyltransferase open reading frame was also kindly provided by Dr. Jeffrey I. Gordon)(28Duronio R.J. Reed S.I. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4129-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Doubly transformed BL21(DE3) cells were obtained by plating transformants on LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin after transformation of calcium-competent cells with up to 1 μg of each plasmid. Transformants were grown in liquid culture to a density of A600 = 0.7-1.0 before adding the inducer isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mM. Where indicated, 125 μM myristate was added at the time of induction as described(26Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). When radiolabeling with [3H]myristate was performed, the label was added at the time of induction to 25-75 μCi/ml. Cells were harvested after 90 min, unless otherwise specified.Nucleotide BindingBinding reactions contained 1 μM Arf and a 10 μM concentration of the indicated radiolabeled guanine nucleotide (specific activity = 1000-10,000 cpm/pmol) in exchange buffer containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and, where indicated, 3 mML-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and 2.5 mM sodium cholate (DMPC/cholate). Samples (10 μl) were taken at the indicated times, and bound nucleotide was determined by rapid filtration on BA85-nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell)(29Northup J.K. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11416-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data were fit to a first-order rate equation using the Marquardt algorithm.Nucleotide DissociationArf (2-5 μM) was incubated with 50 μM [35S]GTPγS (specific activity = 20,000-50,000 cpm/pmol), 10 μM [3H]GDP (specific activity = 10,000-25,000 cpm/pmol), or 5 μM [α-32P]GDP (specific activity = 5000-25,000 cpm/pmol) for 2-3 h in exchange buffer. Dissociation was determined as a loss of protein-bound radiolabel following dilution into exchange buffer containing 1 mM unlabeled guanine nucleotide. Samples were withdrawn at 10-15 time points between 0 and 120 min. Data were fit to a single or double exponential decay equation using the Marquardt algorithm.Determination of Relative Nucleotide AffinitiesThe relative affinities of Arf for GTPγS and GDP were determined by competing the binding of radiolabeled GDP with GTPγS. Arf (1 μM) was incubated with 10 μM [α-32P]GDP or [3H]GDP (specific activity = 5000-10,000 cpm/pmol) and unlabeled 0.5-1000 μM GTPγS in exchange buffer for 3 h for Arf1 or for 1-2 h for the other proteins at 30°C. Protein-bound radionucleotide was determined by rapid filtration on nitrocellulose filters. Each nucleotide was present at concentrations greater than the number of available binding sites, and the concentration of GDP was much greater than KGDP, allowing the data to be fit to the following equation: [Arf·GDP]/[Arftot] = (KGTPγS/KGDP)[GDP]/((KGTPγS/KGDP)[GDP] + [GTPγS]), where all Ks are equilibrium dissociation constants. For [Δ13]Arf1, a significant decrease in GDP binding occurred when the concentration of GTPγS was equal to the concentration of Arf, violating one assumption used in deriving the equation; however, this leads to an underestimate of the protein's affinity for GTPγS (30Cha S. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4814-4818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and does not influence the conclusions of this paper.HPLC of Acylated ArfAcylated and unmodified Arf proteins were resolved under denaturing conditions by reverse-phase chromatography on an analytical C18 column (Dynamax 300Å, Rainin Instrument Co. Inc., Woburn, MA) developed in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with a 30-75% acetonitrile gradient over 45 min (31Randazzo P.A. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Proteins were detected by absorption at 280 nm. Peaks were integrated to determine relative abundance of the modified proteins.Electrospray Ionization-Mass SpectrometryMass spectra were determined on a Finnigan TSQ-70 spectrometer. Solutions of protein (5-20 pmol/μl) were prepared in acetic acid/methanol/water (5:20:80, v/v). Approximately 30 μl was infused from a Harvard syringe pump at 1 μl/min, averaging scans in the profile mode for 3 min. After preliminary analysis using the Finnigan deconvolution program, data were downloaded in ASCII format and sent to MaxENT Solutions, Ltd. (Cambridge, United Kingdom) for maximum entropy analysis.Miscellaneous[α-32P]GTP, [35S]GTPγS, and [3H]GDP were purchased from DuPont NEN. [α-32P]GDP was prepared as described (32Hamel E. Lin C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11060-11069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DMPC (P-0888), GTP (G-8877), and ATP (A-7894) were obtained from Sigma. Sodium cholate was purchased from Fluka Chemical Co. (Ronkokoma, NY), and GTPγS from Boehringer Mannheim. Protein concentrations were determined using the Amido Black assay(33Schaffner W. Weissman C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). Nucleotide concentrations were determined by UV absorbance.RESULTSModification of the N Terminus of Arf1 Has Opposite Consequences for GTPγS and GDP Binding PropertiesTo determine the influence of the amino terminus on GTPγS binding, we compared Arf1 with two N-terminal deletion mutants. For a typical preparation of nonmyristoylated Arf1, steady-state binding of GTPγS reached a stoichiometry of ~0.01 mol/mol of protein when determined in the absence of phospholipids (Fig. 1 and Table I). In contrast, [Δ13]Arf1 and [Δ17]Arf1 (mutants in which the N-terminal 13 and 17 amino acids were deleted, respectively), bound 0.92 and 0.75 mol of nucleotide/mol of protein, respectively (see Ref. 10Randazzo P.A. Terui T. Sturch S. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29490-29494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Table I).Table IMyristoylation confers increased phospholipid dependence, while loss of the N terminus is associated with decreased phospholipid dependence of GTPγS bindingTable IMyristoylation confers increased phospholipid dependence, while loss of the N terminus is associated with decreased phospholipid dependence of GTPγS bindingThese differences in equilibrium binding of GTPγS result from differences in nucleotide affinities. GTPγS dissociated from [Δ13]Arf1 and [Δ17]Arf1 slower than from Arf1 (Fig. 2A and Table II). In contrast, GDP dissociated faster from [Δ13]Arf1 and [Δ17]Arf1 than from the wild-type protein (Fig. 2B and Table II). These opposite changes in dissociation rates should reflect reciprocal changes in guanine nucleotide affinity if nucleotide association rates were not affected by the deletions. Unfortunately, determination of nucleotide association rates is inaccurate and technically demanding because the apoprotein is unstable(34Weiss O. Holden J. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21066-21072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, the relative affinities for GDP and GTPγS were determined by monitoring the binding of GDP when competed with GTPγS. Data are expressed as a ratio of the equilibrium dissociation constants KGDP/KGTPγS as described under “Materials and Methods.” A value >1 indicates that the protein has a greater affinity for GTPγS than for GDP. The ratio KGDP/KGTPγS was >1 for [Δ17]Arf1 and [Δ13]Arf1 and <1 for Arf1 as indicated in Table III. These data reveal that deleting 13 or 17 residues from the N terminus led to coordinate and opposite changes in the binding affinities for GDP and GTPγS. If the amino terminus were simply inhibiting GTP binding, one would expect the deletions to have the same effect on both GTP and GDP binding. Mutation of Residues 3-7 Increases the Affinity for GTPγS-One mutant ([3-7LFASK]Arf1) designed to be a better substrate for N-myristoyltransferase and to allow the production of extensively modified Arf1 in bacteria (see below) fortuitously provided information about the effect of the bound nucleotide on the N terminus. Other than being a better substrate for N-myristoyltransferase, we did not expect the mutations to affect the biochemical properties of the protein. Indeed, no differences in specific activities as cofactors for cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gs (data not shown) were observed between [3-7LFASK]Arf1 and Arf1. However, the nucleotide binding properties of this mutant were found to be similar to those of [Δ13]Arf1 and [Δ17]Arf1 (Fig. 1 and Table I); [3-7LFASK]Arf1 bound more GTPγS at equilibrium than did Arf1. The increased binding of GTPγS was a result of reciprocal changes in the affinity for GTP and GDP. GTPγS dissociated more slowly and GDP dissociated more rapidly from [3-7LFASK]Arf1 than from Arf1. The ratio KGDP/KGTPγS was >1 for [3-7LFASK]Arf1 (Table II). Thus, this mutant provided further evidence that the conformation of the N-terminal domain differs in the GDP- and GTP-bound states.Figure 2:Effect of changing the amino terminus on nucleotide dissociation from Arf. The time dependence of GTPγS (A) and GDP (B) dissociation from Arf1 (invertedtriangles) [Δ17]Arf1 (squares), [Δ13]Arf1 (diamonds), and [3-7LFASK]Arf1 (triangles) was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data are expressed as a fraction of radiolabeled nucleotide bound to Arf at the time the reaction was initiated and were fit to single or double exponential decay equations to derive values for the dissociation rate presented in Table II. This is one of at least three representative experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIDifferences in steady-state binding of GTPγS reflect changes in nucleotide dissociation ratesTable IIDifferences in steady-state binding of GTPγS reflect changes in nucleotide dissociation ratesTable IIIEffects of myristoylation, mutation, and phospholipids on the relative nucleotide affinities of four mutant ArfsTable IIIEffects of myristoylation, mutation, and phospholipids on the relative nucleotide affinities of four mutant ArfsPreparation of Acylated Arf ProteinTo examine the role of myristate in nucleotide exchange, a source for unmodified and acylated Arf1 preparations was sought. Arf preparations from mammalian tissues are composed of a mixture of gene products that cannot be resolved efficiently. Recombinant Arf1 has been produced in bacteria in large amounts and found to yield a homogeneous nonacylated preparation of Arf1(34Weiss O. Holden J. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21066-21072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The coexpression of human Arf1 and yeast N-myristoyltransferase has been used previously to produce the properly modified protein(26Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the extent of myristoylation, determined by reverse-phase HPLC, was typically only 10-15%(31Randazzo P.A. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Attempts to resolve the processed and unprocessed forms of Arf1 or Arf3 by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, MonoQ, hydroxylapatite, phenyl-Sepharose, heptylamine-agarose, or Ultrogel AcA 44 or 54 resins proved unsuccessful (data not shown). Changing the time of induction (up to 18 h) or the concentration of inducer (isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside as low as 50 μM) did not result in increased extents of acylation of Arf1. Similarly, coexpression of human Arf1 with human N-myristoyltransferase in bacteria was not much different from coexpression with yeast N-myristoyltransferase and did not increase the extent of myristoylated human Arf1.In contrast to the inefficient acylation of mammalian Arfs in bacteria, the yeast Arf proteins were observed to have a near optimal sequence (residues 2-7) for N-myristoyltransferase, and a peptide derived from the N terminus of S. cerevisiae Arf2 was shown to be an excellent substrate for N-myristoyltransferase (23Rocque W.J. McWherter C.A. Wood D.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9964-9971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When protein expression was induced in the presence of [3H]myristic acid, similar amounts of label were incorporated into human Arf1 with either human or yeast N-myristoyltransferase (Fig. 3, first and fifthlanes). In contrast, although yeast Arf1 was expressed at similar levels compared with human Arf1, it incorporated much more [3H]myristate, regardless of the source of N-myristoyltransferase (Fig. 3, fourth and eighth lanes). Therefore, S. cerevisiae Arf1 is a much better substrate for either yeast or human N-myristoyltransferase than is human Arf1.Figure 3:Yeast Arf1 and amino-terminal mutants of human Arf1 are highly N-myristoylated when coexpressed in bacteria with human or yeast N-myristoyltransferase. Human Arf1 (hARF1), [6,7SK]Arf1, [3-7LFASK]Arf1, and S. cerevisiae Arf1 (ScARF1) were coexpressed in bacteria with either human (hNMT) or yeast (ScNMT) N-myristoyltransferase. Culturing, induction, and labeling with [3H]myristate were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Approximately 25 μg of total bacterial protein was loaded on each lane of the gel, which was subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue (A) or developed for fluorography (B). The film was exposed overnight at −80°C.

We found that while SFLLRN evokes an initial transient increase in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) of similar magnitude as that caused by thrombin, the SFLLRN-induced elevation of [Ca2+]ideclines more rapidly to near resting levels than that evoked by thrombin, suggesting that disparate levels of [Ca2+]i may contribute to the attenuated arachidonic acid release. Furthermore, we observed that SFLLRN is less effective than thrombin in mediating the “activating” phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2).

We have shown recently that the Ca2+-sensitive cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) in human platelets is responsible for thrombin-stimulated mobilization of arachidonic acid for the synthesis of TXA2. Incubation of platelets with thrombin induced the phosphorylation of cPLA2, thereby increasing its intrinsic catalytic activity(15Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J.V. Hyslop P.A. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26796-26804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the effect of the thrombin receptor agonist peptide SFLLRN on the phosphorylation and activation of cPLA2. We found that SFLLRN does not match the substantial mobilization of arachidonic acid and TXA2 generation induced by thrombin and activates cPLA2 only partially compared with thrombin. We further discovered that SFLLRN is unable to evoke a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i or to mediate activation of the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2. These results demonstrate that in human platelets, both [Ca2+]i transients and activation of proline-directed kinases may play a critical role in thrombin-induced activation of cPLA2. Blood from healthy volunteers was drawn into 0.16 volume of acid/citrate/dextrose (85 mM trisodium citrate, 64 mM citric acid, and 111 mM glucose) containing a 10−7M concentration of a stable prostacyclin analog(15Kramer R.M.

Platelet-rich plasma (20 ml) was prepared from blood of donors who had taken 325 mg of aspirin the night before and again on the morning of phlebotomy and incubated for 1 h at 37°C with 10 μCi of [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H] arachidonic acid (~60 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) added in 1 ml of 5 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8, bound to fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (100 mg/ml). Free [3H] arachidonic acid was removed by washing platelets as detailed above. The incorporation of [3H] arachidonic acid into platelet phospholipids was ~25%, and the content of esterified [3H]arachidonic acid was ~2 × 105 dpm/108 platelets. [3H]Arachidonic acid-labeled platelets suspended at 0.5 × 109/ml in 140NaCl, 27 mM KCl, 1 m MgCl2, 3CaCl2, 5.5glucose, 0.5EGTA, 10Hepes, pH 7.4, were incubated with thrombin (5 units/ml) or SFLLRN (80 μM). Reactions were stopped by adding 2 ml of Dole's reagent (2-propanol, heptane, 0.sulfuric acid (40:10:1)), and the released [3H]arachidonic acid plus 12-lipoxygenase metabolites were extracted and quantified as described(18Kramer R.M. Jakubowski J.A. Deykin D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 959: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i was measured using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator indo-1/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Platelet-rich plasma was incubated for 45 min at room temperature with 3.3 μM indo-1/AM. The platelets were then pelleted and washed as detailed above; suspended at 0.5 × 109/ml in 140 mM NaCl, 27 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 3 mM CaCl2, 5.5 mM glucose, 0.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 30 μM glycoprotein IIb-IIIa antagonist; and transferred to a glass cuvette, which was placed in a thermostatically controlled chamber at 37°C in an SLM-AMINCO Model 48000 spectrofluorometer and stirred magnetically. After 2 min, thrombin or SFLLRN was added directly to the cuvette at the indicated concentrations. Indo-1 was excited at 355 nm, and emission was detected at 405 and 485 nm, the fluorescence maxima for Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free indo-1, respectively. Changes of the fluorescence intensities at these two emission wavelengths were continuously monitored during stimulation. The platelet suspension was then centrifuged, and the fluorescence of the supernatants was assessed and subtracted from the suspension readings to correct for extracellular probe. The relative changes in the ratio of the fluorescence at 405 nm to that at 485 nm (i.e. ratio = 405 nm/485 nm) were used to quantitate the changes in [Ca2+]i upon stimulation with thrombin or SFLLRN. [Ca2+]i was calculated assuming a Kd of 250 nM for indo-1(19Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3340-3350Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Soluble extracts were diluted 5-fold with 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 100 μM Na3VO4, 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, and then applied to a MonoQ HR 5/5 column equilibrated in 25 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 100 μM Na3VO4, 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, using a Pharmacia Biotech fast protein liquid chromatography system. After extensive washing, the column was eluted with a 40-ml linear salt gradient from 25 to 500 mM NaCl at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and assayed for kinase activity. Platelets were prepared and exposed to thrombin or SFLLRN as detailed above. The reaction was stopped by adding (final concentrations) 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM Na3VO4, 1 μM microcystin, 100 μM leupeptin, 0.2 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 μM pepstatin A, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.5. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C (for kinase assays in lysates) or at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4°C (for MonoQ chromatography). Kinase assays were performed as described by Ahn et al.(20Ahn N.G. Weiel J.E. Chan C.P. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

Reactions were initiated by the addition of 8.33 μl of 3 × ATP reaction buffer to provide (final concentrations) 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 μM protein kinase A inhibitor peptide (Sigma), 1 mM EGTA, 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM ATP (containing 40 μCi/ml [γ-33P]ATP, ~2000 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) and were allowed to proceed for 20 min at 30°C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 90% formic acid containing 50 mM ATP. Aliquots of 25 μl were applied to phosphocellulose membranes in SpinZyme separation units (Pierce). The membranes were washed four times with 0.5 ml of 1% phosphoric acid using centrifugation, retrieved from the unit, and transferred to scintillation vials containing 1 ml of 1% SDS. After the addition of 10 ml of Ready Protein+ (Beckman Instruments), the radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific incorporation of radioactivity was determined in the absence of peptide/protein substrate. After the addition of SDS sample buffer, platelet lysates were incubated at 60°C for 15 min and electrophoresed at 4°C on 10% Tris/glycine gels at 35 mA for 3.5 h (for cPLA2 detection) or at 30 mA for 2.5 h (for MAP kinase detection) using the Novex system. Standard proteins included rainbow markers (range of 14.3-200 kDa; Amersham Corp.), human cPLA2, and MAP kinase ERK1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). After electroblotting, the nitrocellulose sheets were probed with mouse M3-1/horseradish peroxidase conjugate or rabbit anti-MAP kinase ERK1/2 antibodies (erk1-CT (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and ERK 2 (C-14) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)) and developed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.) as detailed before(15Kramer R.M.

Human platelets from donors that had taken aspirin were labeled with carrier-free [33P]H3PO4 as described(15Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J.V. Hyslop P.A. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26796-26804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets were incubated at 1 × 109/ml for 5 min at 37°C without or with 5 units/ml thrombin as detailed above. The reaction was stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mM and by pelleting platelets for 1 min at 8500 × g at 4°C. The platelets were solubilized, and cPLA2 was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-cPLA2 IgG as described(15Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J.V. Hyslop P.A. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26796-26804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated cPLA2 (~200 ng) derived from 4 × 109 platelets was subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gel, 1.5 mm thick, 10 wells), electroblotted onto Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp.), and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The band containing the 33P-labeled cPLA2 was excised and subjected to acid hydrolysis with 5.7 N HCl for 1 h at 110°C as described(22Kamps M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The samples were dried in a Speed Vac (Savant Instruments, Inc.); suspended in 5 μl of water containing 10 μg each of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine; and subjected to ascending thin-layer chromatography on cellulose plates (Merck) with butanol/acetic acid/ethanol/H2O (1:1:1:1) as the mobile phase. The plates were dried, sprayed with EN3HANCE (DuPont NEN), and exposed to x-ray film. The positions of standard phosphoamino acids were identified by staining with ninhydrin. PLA2 activity was assayed using sonicated liposomes containing 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (~50 mCi/mmol; DuPont NEN) and sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) at a molar ratio of 2:1 as described previously (23Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J. Putnam J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5268-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications as follows. The assay buffer consisted of 1 mM DTT, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mM CaCl2, 2 μM [14C]arachidonoylphosphatidylcholine (50,000 dpm), 1 μM dioleoylglycerol, and incubations were carried out at 37°C for 15 min. The results are presented as disintegrations/minute [14C]arachidonic acid released. Protein measurements were made in the presence of 0.05% SDS using Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a reference standard. The concentration of thromboxane B2 (reflecting TXA2 generation) was determined by radioimmunoassay as described previously(24Jakubowski J.A. Stampfer M.J. Vaillancourt R. Deykin D. Br. J. Haematol. 1985; 60: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Platelet aggregation and ATP release were assayed as described previously(25Thompson C.B. Jakubowski J.A. Quinn P.G. Deykin D. Valeri R. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1983; 101: 205-213PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with previous studies, we found that SFLLRN, like thrombin, induced platelet aggregation and ATP secretion(2Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2675) Google Scholar, 3Hui K.Y. Jakubowski J.A. Wyss V.L. Angleton E.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6081-6085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We determined that the concentrations of thrombin and SFLLRN for half-maximal release of ATP were 0.33 ± 0.12 units/ml and 3.8 ± 1.7 μM (mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments using different donors), respectively. The concentrations causing half-maximal aggregation of platelets induced by thrombin and SFLLRN were 0.15 ± 0.05 units/ml and 2.6 ± 2.0 μM (mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments using different donors), respectively. In agreement with previous work, the molar concentration of peptide required to produce a response equivalent to that of thrombin was ~1000 times that of thrombin (1 unit/ml thrombin taken to be 10 nM). We observed that human platelets stimulated with the peptide SFLLRN produce less TXA2 than platelets stimulated with thrombin (Fig. 1). As shown with a dose dependence and time course study, the generation of TXA2 by platelets was maximal with 25 μM SFLLRN and stopped after 1 min of activation. In contrast, thrombin-induced TXA2 formation continued to increase up to 10 min. We next examined whether the lower amount of TXA2 formed in response to SFLLRN was the result of decreased mobilization of arachidonic acid. We prelabeled aspirinized platelets with [3H]arachidonic acid and measured the release of radiolabeled arachidonic acid (including 12-lipoxygenase metabolites) from platelet phospholipids after stimulation with thrombin or SFLLRN. As shown in Fig. 2, the liberation of arachidonic acid was significantly lower when platelets were stimulated with SFLLRN compared with thrombin. These findings suggest that the enzyme responsible for thrombin-induced arachidonic acid release, cPLA2, may not be fully activated by SFLLRN. Kinetics of Elevation of [Ca2+]i by Thrombin and SFLLRN-Previous studies using cell-free systems and purified cPLA2 have demonstrated that Ca2+ plays a critical role in the activation of cPLA2 as it promotes association of cPLA2 with its membrane phospholipid substrate(26Channon J.Y. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5409-5413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). We therefore questioned whether dissimilar [Ca2+]i responses may be the reason for the differential mobilization of arachidonic acid in platelets stimulated with SFLLRN and thrombin. SFLLRN peptides were reported to stimulate a transient increase in [Ca2+]i similar to thrombin(2Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2675) Google Scholar, 28Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6044-6050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ngaiza J.R. Jaffe E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 1656-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To verify that this was also true for human platelets, we loaded platelets with indo-1 and compared SFLLRN- and thrombin-induced changes in [Ca2+]i by spectrofluorometry. As shown in Fig. 3, SFLLRN and thrombin elevated [Ca2+]i from resting levels of ~50 nM to 1 and 0.6 μM, respectively, with two apparent differences in the time course of the [Ca2+]i transients. First, the maximal increase in [Ca2+]i induced by SFLLRN was greater than and preceded that induced by thrombin. Second, the [Ca2+]i transient evoked by SFLLRN declined more rapidly with time than that induced by thrombin. These results demonstrate that although SFLLRN reproduces the thrombin-induced initial rise of [Ca2+]i to ≥600 nM, it is unable to maintain the prolonged elevation of [Ca2+]i at ~300 nM caused by thrombin. Hence, the differential release and metabolism of arachidonic acid observed with SFLLRN and thrombin could be a consequence of dissimilar [Ca2+]i responses.Figure 2:Time course of thrombin- and SFLLRN-induced release of [3H]arachidonic acid in platelets. Aspirinized platelets prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid were suspended at 0.5 × 109/ml and incubated with thrombin (5 units/ml) or SFLLRN (80 μM) at 37°C. The reaction was stopped, and released [3H]arachidonic acid ([3H]AA; including 12-lipoxygenase products) was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data are representative of two different experiments, and values shown are the means ± range of two separate incubations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3:Effect of thrombin and SFLLRN on changes in [Ca2+] in human platelets.

The change in indo-1 fluorescence was continuously monitored at 37°C in the fluorometer, and Ca2+ transients were quantitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 5 min, the [Ca2+] in thrombin- and SFLLRN-stimulated platelets in this experiment was 211 and 73 nM, respectively.

Phosphoamino acid analysis of 33P-labeled cPLA2 immunoprecipitated from platelets revealed the presence of phosphoserine after thrombin stimulation (Fig. 4), indicating that a serine protein kinase may be responsible for the activating phosphorylation of cPLA2 in platelets. Thrombin-mediated phosphorylation converts cPLA2 to a form with decreased electrophoretic mobility, thereby providing a convenient means to monitor stimulus-induced phosphorylation and activation of cPLA2 (15Kramer R.M.

As demonstrated with a dose dependence experiment (Fig. 5) and a time course study (Fig. 6), SFLLRN induced an incomplete gel shift and hence only partial activating phosphorylation of cPLA2 compared with thrombin (Fig. 5A and 6A). Accordingly, the SFLLRN-induced enhancement of cPLA2 activity in lysates derived from stimulated platelets was lower than that observed with thrombin (Fig. 5B and 6B). These results suggest that the liberation of arachidonic acid and the production of TXA2 in platelets may not be sustained in response to SFLLRN compared with thrombin due to incomplete phosphorylation and activation of cPLA2.Figure 5:Dose dependence of the effect of thrombin and SFLLRN on cPLA2 activity in lysates from human platelets.

Using a two-hybrid system screen of a mouse brain cDNA library, we have isolated several clones encoding proteins that interact with Rab6. Approximately 60% of the clones identified encoded a new mouse Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) isoform. This GDI isoform is distinct from mouse mGDI-1 and mGDI-2, which have been characterized previously, and most likely represents the mouse counterpart of the rat Rab GDIβ isoform. In the two-hybrid system, GDIβ interacts with wild-type Rab6 and Rab5, but not with a GTP-bound Rab6 mutant, or a Rab6 mutant that cannot be post-translationally processed. We further examined whether mouse GDIβ is functional; we show that recombinant mouse GDIβ is able to remove several Rab proteins, including Rab1, Rab2, Rab4, and Rab6, from membranes. The identification of a third GDI isoform in mouse raised the question whether GDI genes belong to a larger multigenic family. We have shown, by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA, that at least five GDI gene copies exist in both the mouse and rat genomes.In our two-hybrid screen, we have also characterized another clone that specifically interacts with Rab6. This clone was partially sequenced but shows no homology to known sequences. Finally, a third clone, interacting with both Rab5 and Rab6, also appears to encode a novel protein.

In the two-hybrid system, GDIβ interacts with wild-type Rab6 and Rab5, but not with a GTP-bound Rab6 mutant, or a Rab6 mutant that cannot be post-translationally processed. We further examined whether mouse GDIβ is functional; we show that recombinant mouse GDIβ is able to remove several Rab proteins, including Rab1, Rab2, Rab4, and Rab6, from membranes. The identification of a third GDI isoform in mouse raised the question whether GDI genes belong to a larger multigenic family. We have shown, by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA, that at least five GDI gene copies exist in both the mouse and rat genomes. In our two-hybrid screen, we have also characterized another clone that specifically interacts with Rab6. This clone was partially sequenced but shows no homology to known sequences. Finally, a third clone, interacting with both Rab5 and Rab6, also appears to encode a novel protein."

However, the kinetic properties of ST8Sia III revealed that it is much more specific to N-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins than glycosphingolipids. The expression pattern of the ST8Sia III gene was clearly different from those of other α2,8-sialyltransferase genes. The expression of the ST8Sia III gene was tissue and stage specific. The ST8Sia III gene was expressed only in brain and testis, and it appeared first in 20 postcoitum embryonal brain and then decreased.

INTRODUCTIONThe DNA sequence motif (A/T)GATA(A/G), hereafter referred to only as GATA, is known to be involved in lineage-specific gene expression in other organisms, most prominently in the control of globin gene transcription in vertebrates (reviewed in Refs. Evans and Felsenfeld, 1990Evans T. Felsenfeld G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 95-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, Engel et al., 1991Engel J.D. George K.M. Ko L.J. Kornhauser J.M.

Blood. 1992; 80: 575-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). “GATA-binding proteins” or “GATA factors” are a class of transcriptional activators that bind to GATA sequences in DNA. Six classes of GATA factors (termed GATA-1 through GATA-6) have now been defined in vertebrates(Laverriere et al., 1994Laverriere A.C. MacNeill C. Mueller C. Poelmann R.E. Burch J.B.E. Evans T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23177-23184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and all have a pair of distinctive zinc finger domains. Several one-finger GATA factors have been identified in fungi (Kudla et al., 1990Kudla B. Caddick M.X. Langdon T. Martinez-Rossi N.M. Bennett C.F. Sibley S. Davies R.W. Arst Jr., H.N.

Biol. 1991; 11: 6216-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and two GATA factors have been identified in Drosophila, one with a single zinc finger (Abel et al., 1993Abel T. Michelson A.M. Maniatis T. Development. 1993; 119: 623-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and one with a pair of zinc fingers(Ramain et al., 1993Ramain P. Heitzler P. Haenlin M. Simpson P. Development. 1993; 119: 1277-1291PubMed Google Scholar, Winnick et al., 1993Winnick J. Abel T. Leonard M.W. Michelson A.M. Chardon-Loriaux I. Holmgren R.A. Maniatis T. Engel J.D. Development. 1993; 119: 1055-1065PubMed Google Scholar). One GATA factor (named elt-1, standing for erythroid-like transcription factor 1) has been isolated from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans on the basis of sequence homology with chicken GATA-1(Spieth et al., 1991Spieth J. Shim Y.H. Lea K. Conrad R. Blumenthal T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4651-4659Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).We have been studying the C. elegans ges-1 (gut esterase 1) gene as an example of a terminally differentiated gene whose expression is restricted to the intestine. The ges-1 gene is expressed via transcription from the zygotic genome, beginning when the developing gut has only four to eight cells(Edgar and McGhee, 1986Edgar L.G. McGhee J.D. Dev. Biol. 1986; 114: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). At this stage, the entire embryo has only 150-200 cells and ges-1 is one of the earliest markers of tissue-specific differentiation to appear in the C. elegans embryo. Our previous deletion-transformation analysis identified a region within the ges-1 promoter that appears to function both as a gut activator and as a pharynx/tail repressor(Aamodt et al., 1991Aamodt E.J. Chung M.A. McGhee J.D. Science. 1991; 252: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A more detailed analysis of this region has revealed that the 30-base pair region controlling the spatial expression of ges-1 contains a tandem pair of (A/T)GATA(A/G) sequences(Egan et al., 1995Egan C.R. Chung M.A. Allen F.L. Heschl M.F.P. van Buskirk C.L. McGhee J.D. Dev. Biol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, nuclear extracts prepared from C. elegans embryos contain a factor that binds to these motifs(Stroeher et al., 1994Stroeher V.L. Kennedy B.P. Millen K.L. Schroeder D.F. Hawkins M.G. Goszczynski B. McGhee J.D. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Judging from the sequence of the ges-1 control region (Egan et al., 1995Egan C.R. Chung M.A. Allen F.L. Heschl M.F.P. van Buskirk C.L. McGhee J.D. Dev. Biol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, Stroeher et al., 1994Stroeher V.L. Kennedy B.P. Millen K.L. Schroeder D.F.

McGhee J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 890-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), expression of the ges-1 gene is likely to involve a GATA factor. The obvious candidate for such a factor is the product of the elt-1 gene(Spieth et al., 1991Spieth J. Shim Y.H. Lea K. Conrad R. Blumenthal T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4651-4659Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, homozygous deficiency embryos lacking the elt-1 gene still express ges-1(Stroeher et al., 1994Stroeher V.L. Kennedy B.P. Millen K.L. Schroeder D.F. Hawkins M.G. Goszczynski B. McGhee J.D. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that elt-1 is not required zygotically for ges-1 expression. With the aim of identifying a factor that does control ges-1, we have probed a C. elegans cDNA expression library with multimerized ges-1 GATA sequences. The present report describes the result of this screen, the identification of a second C. elegans GATA factor elt-2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneral Materials and MethodsUnless otherwise stated, all DNA manipulations were carried out as described in Ausubel et al.(Ausubel et al., 1994Ausubel F.M.

Section 1734 solely to indicate this fact.The nucleotide sequence(s) reported in this paper has been submitted to the GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank with accession number(s) U25175. system (Perkin Elmer) and analyzed by automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 373A). Routine handling of C. elegans was performed as described by Brenner(Brenner, 1974Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Isolation of cDNA and Genomic ClonesA mixed stage C. elegans λgt11 cDNA library (obtained from Dr. P. Okkema, Carnegie Institute of Washington, Baltimore, MD) was screened with a 32P-labeled multimerized GATA-containing double-stranded oligonucleotide using the method of Vinson et al.(Vinson et al., 1988Vinson C.R. LaMarco K.L. Johnson P.F. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar); the exact oligonucleotide sequences are given under “Results.” A single positive clone was isolated and subsequently used as a probe to isolate further clones from an independent C. elegans mixed stage cDNA library prepared in λZAP(Barstead and Waterston, 1989Barstead R.J. Waterston R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10177-10185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The probe was radioactively labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Prime-it II kit (Stratagene), and hybridizations were performed at 65°C for 18 h (6 × SSC, 1% SDS, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA). The filters were washed at high stringency (0.1 × SSC, 1% SDS, 65°C) and exposed to x-ray film overnight (X-Omat; Eastman Kodak Co.). The longest such cDNA clone was sequenced on both strands using a combination of unidirectional nested deletions (Henikoff, 1987Henikoff S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) and custom synthesized primers (Regional Oligonucleotide Synthesis Unit, University of Calgary). The 5′ and 3′ ends of all the other purified λZAP clones were also sequenced.Genomic clones were isolated from a C. elegans λEMBL-4 library (obtained from Dr. C. Link, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO). The library was screened with a full-length elt-2 cDNA fragment, radioactively labeled using random oligonucleotide primers; hybridization and washing conditions were as described above. Once the gene sequence had been determined (see below), Southern blotting confirmed that restriction fragments of the lengths predicted from the sequence could indeed be identified in the appropriate digests of C. elegans genomic DNA.Amplification of 5′ End of mRNA TranscriptPoly(A) mRNA was prepared from a mixed population of N2 worms using a Micro-Fastrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized as described by Frohman et al.(Frohman et al., 1988Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4323) Google Scholar). PCR amplifications were performed using the C. elegans trans-spliced primers SL1 (Krause and Hirsh, 1987Krause M. Hirsh D. Cell. 1987; 49: 753-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) or SL2 (Huang and Hirsh, 1989Huang X.-Y. Hirsh D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8640-8644Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and several elt-2-specific antisense internal primers. PCR products generated were cloned and sequenced.In Vitro Transcription-Translation of cDNA Clones and Gel Mobility ShiftsELT-2 protein was produced from elt-2 cDNA contained in the vector pBluescript SK− (Stratagene) using the TNT-coupled transcription-translation system (Promega). Deletion constructs of ELT-2, in which either amino acids 1-174 or amino acids 243-433 had been removed, were also produced by in vitro transcription and translation. DNA binding activity was analyzed by gel mobility shift assays, essentially as described by Stroeher et al.(Stroeher et al., 1994Stroeher V.L. Kennedy B.P. Millen K.L. Schroeder D.F. Hawkins M.G. Goszczynski B. McGhee J.D. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Each reaction typically contained 2 ng of double-stranded oligonucleotide probe, 100 ng of poly[d(I-C)] competitor DNA (unless specified otherwise), and either 1 μl of in vitro transcription/translation reaction (full-length ELT-2 or deletion construct as appropriate) or 10 μg of nuclear extract, prepared from fluorodeoxyuridine-blocked embryos as described by Stroeher et al.(Stroeher et al., 1994Stroeher V.L. Kennedy B.P. Millen K.L. Schroeder D.F. Hawkins M.G. Goszczynski B. McGhee J.D. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Northern BlottingRNA was isolated from staged worms using a total RNA purification kit (Clontech) and analyzed for levels of elt-2 message by Northern hybridization using a Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham International plc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The full-length elt-2 cDNA, random oligo-labeled as described above, was used as a probe. After hybridization and washing (using the same conditions described above), filters were exposed to X-Omat x-ray film (Kodak) with intensifying screens at −70°C for 1-30 days.RESULTSIsolation of a cDNA Clone by Probing C. elegans Expression Libraries with GATA Sequences from the Gut Activator Region of the ges-1 GeneWe have identified a tandem pair of GATA sequences required for the gut-specific expression of the ges-1 gene in the C. elegans embryo(Egan et al., 1995Egan C.R. Chung M.A. Allen F.L. Heschl M.F.P. van Buskirk C.L. McGhee J.D. Dev. Biol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Both single GATA motifs and the double GATA motif (see Fig. 1) appear to bind the same protein present in embryo extracts(Stroeher et al., 1994Stroeher V.L. Kennedy B.P. Millen K.L. Schroeder D.F. Hawkins M.G. Goszczynski B. McGhee J.D. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The downstream GATA sequence (with terminal extensions added to ensure directional cloning; see Fig. 1) was ligated into 11 tandem copies, kinase-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, and used as probe to screen an expression library prepared in λgt11 from mixed stage C. elegans RNA (Okkema and Fire, 1994Okkema P.G. Fire A. Development. 1994; 120: 2175-2186PubMed Google Scholar). One positive clone was isolated from approximately 300,000 plaques screened; partial sequence analysis revealed that the clone did indeed code for a “GATA factor” protein, as will be discussed in detail below. The gene has been named elt-2 in accordance with C. elegans nomenclature conventions(Horvitz et al., 1979Horvitz H.R. Brenner S. Hodgkin J. Herman R.K. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1979; 175: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).The insert from this original elt-2 cDNA clone was amplified by PCR and used as probe to screen a mixed-stage cDNA library prepared in λZAP(Barstead and Waterston, 1989Barstead R.J. Waterston R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10177-10185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Eleven positive clones were isolated from approximately 350,000 plaques screened under high stringency conditions; partial sequence analysis and restriction mapping indicated that all of these clones were derived from the same transcript.The longest elt-2 cDNA clone is 1560 bp (excluding the poly(A) tail) and is essentially full-length. Reverse transcriptase-PCR (Frohman et al., 1988Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4323) Google Scholar) showed that elt-2 mRNA is trans-spliced to the SL1 leader sequence(Krause and Hirsh, 1987Krause M. Hirsh D. Cell. 1987; 49: 753-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), and the last three nucleotides of the SL1 leader sequence can indeed be identified at the 5′ end of the longest cDNA clone. Reverse transcriptase-PCR using the SL2 trans-splice primer (Huang and Hirsh, 1989Huang X.-Y. Hirsh D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8640-8644Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) instead of SL1 did not produce a product (data not shown). As will be shown below, the length of the longest cDNA agrees well with the estimated size of the elt-2 message detected by Northern blotting.Position of the elt-2 Gene on the Physical Map of the C. elegans GenomeThe isolated insert from the longest cDNA clone was used as a probe to screen a C. elegans genomic library under high stringency conditions. Six positive phage were isolated and restriction mapping showed them all to be identical or overlapping. A total of 5433 bp of elt-2 genomic sequence, including the entire gene, 3.5 kilobase pairs of upstream flanking region and 0.3 kilobase pair of downstream flanking region, has been obtained and deposited in GenBank™ (accession no. U25175). The genomic clones were used to locate the elt-2 gene on the physical map of the C. elegans genome (Dr. A. Coulson, MRC, Cambridge, UK). elt-2 lies just right of center on the X chromosome (cosmid C12H7 on the C. elegans physical map), close to the gene mab-18. No obvious genetic candidate for elt-2 has been identified in this vicinity.Twelve examples of the sequence (A/T)GATA(A/G) can be identified in the elt-2 5′-flanking region (not shown), approximately twice as many as would be expected by chance. During erythropoiesis in vertebrates, expression of GATA-1 is autoregulated through flanking GATA motifs(Schwartzbauer et al., 1992Schwartzbauer G. Schlesinger K. Evans T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4429-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, Tsai et al., 1991Tsai S.-F. Strauss E. Orkin S.H. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 919-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and elt-2 may be similarly autoregulatedAlignment of elt-2 Genomic, cDNA, and Protein SequencesComparison of the genomic and cDNA sequences allows unambiguous assignment of the intron-exon structure of the elt-2 gene, as shown schematically in Fig. 2A. The elt-2 cDNA and protein sequences are aligned on Fig. 2B. The longest open reading frame (433 amino acid residues, producing a predicted protein of Mr 47,000) begins with a putative initiator methionine residue 1 base pair downstream of the SL1 trans-splice acceptor site; this reading frame includes the distinctive GATA-factor DNA binding domain, as will be discussed in detail in the next section. A potential poly(A) addition site (AATAAA) is present 237 nucleotides downstream of the proposed translation termination codon and 11 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A) sequence found in the cDNA clones.Figure 2:Alignment of the elt-2 genomic, cDNA, and protein sequences. A, schematic alignment of the elt-2 genomic and cDNA structures. The elt-2 gene contains nine exons; the length of each exon in base pairs is noted above the genomic clone. The lengths of the eight introns (in base pairs) are listed in italics below the 1.6-kilobase pair schematic diagram of the elt-2 cDNA. Intron 6 interrupts the conserved zinc finger domain (shaded). B, nucleotide sequence of the elt-2 cDNA and deduced amino acid sequence. Numbers on the right refer to the amino acid and nucleotide sequences, respectively. The longest open reading frame is 433 amino acids, beginning at the first ATG codon after the SL1 trans-splice leader sequence (underlined). A putative polyadenylation site (aataaa) is double-underlined and is 237 nucleotides downstream of the proposed translation termination codon. The conserved zinc finger DNA binding domain (amino acids 237-261) is shaded. Intron positions are indicated by the arrowheads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The elt-2 Gene Encodes a Distinctive Zinc Finger Domain of the Type Found in GATA FactorsThe ELT-2 protein contains a region whose sequence is clearly related to the zinc finger DNA binding domains of all GATA factors yet reported. The majority of GATA factors have two such domains, but ELT-2 appears to only have one (as do several factors isolated from fungi and from Drosophila, as noted earlier). Fig. 3A aligns the sequence of the single zinc finger domain of ELT-2 (amino acids 237-261) with the sequence of the C-terminal finger of the previously isolated GATA factors elt-1 from C. elegans(Spieth et al., 1991Spieth J.

As shown in Fig. 4A, ELT-2 protein binds to the downstream GATA sequence of the ges-1 gene (the sequence used as probe for the library screening), and this binding is resistant to a large excess of the nonspecific competitor poly[d(I-C)]. Formation of the complex is competed effectively with the unlabeled oligonucleotide, but is competed ineffectively by an oligonucleotide in which the TGATAA sequence has been mutated to GTCGCC (Fig. 4B).

https://openalex.org/W1977633287,"The Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) is a target for protein tyrosine kinases of both the receptor and cytoplasmic classes and may serve to integrate tyrosine kinase and Ras signaling pathways. In this report, we provide evidence that GAP is an SH3 domain-binding protein and substrate for the Src-related tyrosine kinase Hck, which has been implicated in the regulation of myeloid cell growth, differentiation, and function. Wild-type (WT) or kinase-inactive (K269E) mutant Hck proteins were co-expressed with bovine GAP using the baculovirus/Sf-9 cell system. GAP was readily phosphorylated on tyrosine by WT but not K269E Hck. GAP was present in WT Hck immunoprecipitates from the co-infected cells, indicative of Hck·GAP complex formation. Unexpectedly, GAP also associated with the kinase-inactive mutant of Hck, suggesting that tyrosine autophosphorylation of Hck is not required for complex formation. The WT and K269E forms of Hck also associated with GAP mutants lacking either the C-terminal catalytic domain (ΔCAT) or the Src homology region (ΔSH), indicating that these GAP domains are dispensable for complex formation. Recombinant GST fusion proteins containing the Hck, Src, Fyn, or Lck SH3 domains associated with full-length GAP, ΔCAT, and ΔSH, all of which share an N-terminal proline-rich region resembling an SH3-binding motif (PPLPPPPPQLP). Deletion of the highly conserved YXY sequence from the Hck SH3 domain abolished binding. GAP-SH3 interaction was also inhibited by the proline-rich peptide GFPPLPPPPPQLPTLG, which corresponds to N-terminal amino acids 129-144 of bovine GAP. An N-terminal deletion mutant of GAP lacking this proline-rich region did not bind to the Hck SH3 domain. These data implicate the Hck SH3 domain in GAP interaction, and suggest a general function for the SH3 domains of Src family kinases in recognition of GAP via its proline-rich N-terminal domain."

J. 1992; 287: 995-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis of PKC has identified the two cysteine-rich regions in the regulatory domain as the sites of phorbol ester binding (8Ono Y. Fujii T. Igarashi K. Kono T. Tanaka C. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4868-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Each of these cysteine-rich regions is a 50-amino-acid domain possessing the motif HX12CX2CXnCX2CX4HX2CX7C (where H is histidine, C is cysteine, X is any other amino acid, and n = 13 or 14). An identical motif is present in n-chimaerin and Unc-13. Although the PKCs contain two cysteine-rich regions, a single recombinant cysteine-rich region is sufficient for binding [3H]PDBu with high affinity(6Areces L.B. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol.

The anionic phospholipids fully reconstitute the phorbol ester binding, with phosphatidylserine being the most efficient (14Kazanietz M.G. Krausz K.W. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol.

In this study we examined the binding of [3H]PDBu both to intact PKC δ and to the purified single cysteine-rich region of PKC δ in the absence of phospholipid cofactor. Our results clearly show that phorbol esters still bound to PKC in the absence of phospholipids, although with a reduced affinity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials[3H]PDBu (20.7 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN (Boston, MA).

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7925-7931Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) as a template and the following oligonucleotides containing BamHI and EcoRI sites (underlined) for unidirectional cloning: 5′-TGAGGATCCCACCGATTCAAGGTTTATAAC and 5′-ATCGAATTCACACAGGTTGGCCACCTTCTC. The 160-base pair fragment was subcloned in the pCR2000 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced to confirm complete homology with the original sequence. The BamHI-EcoRI fragment was then isolated and ligated in frame in the pGEX-2TK vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to get the pGEXTK-CRRδ plasmid. In order to induce the expression of the recombinant cysteine-rich region (as a glutathione S-transferase-fusion protein) Escherichia coli JM101 cells were transformed with the pGEXTK-CRRδ plasmid, the bacteria grown up to an A600 of 0.5 in 1 liter of LB media containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and the recombinant protein induced by addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. Five hours later cells were pelleted at 4,000 × g and resuspended in 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 3 mM dithiothreitol. Cells were lysed by homogenization, passed two times through a French press, and sonicated. Cellular debris was pelleted for 45 min at 15,000 × g (4°C), the remaining suspension was centrifuged subsequently at 30,000 × g for 2 h (4°C), and the supernatant was collected. For the purification of the glutathione S-transferase-fused cysteine-rich region of PKC δ, 10 ml of a 50% glutathione-Sepharose 4B suspension (Pharmacia) were added to the supernatant and incubated at 4°C for 1 h. The glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were collected by centrifugation (500 × g, 5 min), and the glutathione S-transferase-fusion protein was then eluted by incubation of the beads with 1 ml of 10 mM reduced glutathione in 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, as described by the manufacturer. The elution procedure was repeated an additional three times, and the collected fractions were pooled. The recombinant fusion protein showed >90% purity in Coomassie Blue-stained gels (data not shown). The solution was then treated with 250 units of thrombin for 4 h, time enough to cleave all of the recombinant cysteine-rich region from the glutathione S-transferase as checked by gel electrophoresis. In order to remove the thrombin, the eluate was made 0.5 M in NaCl and treated with 2 ml of benzamidine-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) for 1 h at 25°C. The beads were pelleted and the supernatant was partially desalted by ultrafiltration through an Amicon 3000 MW filter. The retentate was lyophilized and purified by HPLC on C4 silica gel using a gradient of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O: 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in 90/10 CH3CN/H2O, from 75:25 to 25:75 over 30 min. The cysteine-rich region eluted at 14.8 min in this system, and the residual glutathione S-transferase eluted at 18 min (see Fig. 1, A and B). The protein obtained by this procedure was refolded as described previously(17Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Schaad O. Felsenfeld G. Trainor C. Apella E. Stahl S.J. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1993; 261: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein was dissolved in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (pH 2.54), 2.5-3 molar eq (based on weight of protein) of Zn2+ (as 50 mM ZnCl2) were added, and the pH was slowly raised to 6.00 with dilute NaOH. The solution was concentrated on Centricon-3 filters. The cysteine-rich region purified by HPLC showed a single peak in the HPLC profile (Fig. 1B) and a single band in Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1C).[3H]PDBu Binding-[3H]PDBu binding was measured using the polyethylene glycol precipitation assay developed in our laboratory (18Sharkey N.A. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 19-24PubMed Google Scholar). For the determination of the Kd and Bmax in the presence of phospholipid the assay was performed as follows. An assay mixture (250 μl) containing 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 4 mg/ml bovine IgG, increasing concentrations of [3H]PDBu, and a recombinant cysteine-rich region or intact PKC was incubated for 5 min at 37°C. The samples were then chilled on ice for 5 min, and 200 μl of 35% polyethylene glycol in 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, was added. The tubes were incubated for an additional 15 min to induce precipitation of the protein and were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min in a Beckman 12 microcentrifuge (at 4°C). An aliquot (100 μl) of the supernatant was removed for determination of the free radioligand. The pellet was carefully dried with disposable wipes, and then the tip of the tube was cut off and the bound [3H]PDBu was determined in a scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding was measured using 30 μM PDBu; the specific binding was calculated as the difference between the total and the nonspecific binding and was >80% even at the highest [3H]PDBu concentration.For measuring the parameters for [3H]PDBu binding in the absence of phospholipids we determined the Kd from competition curves with nonradioactive PDBu. This experimental approach is described by Turner and Bylund (19Turner J.T. Bylund D.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 242: 873-881PubMed Google Scholar) and Blumberg et al. (20Blumberg P.M. Dunn J.A. Jaken S. Jeng A. Leach K.L. Sharkey N.A. Yeh E. Slaga T.J. Mechanisms of Tumor Promotion. Vol. III. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1984: 143-184Google Scholar). Typical saturation curves with increasing concentrations of [3H]PDBu could not be performed because of the very high concentrations of radioligand needed. In a typical assay 6-8 increasing concentrations of the nonradioactive PDBu (in triplicate) were used to compete 100 nM [3H]PDBu in a mixture containing 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EGTA, and 4 mg/ml bovine IgG (or other carrier protein when indicated). After incubation (5 min, 37°C), samples were chilled on ice for 5 min. Precipitation and separation of the free and bound radioligand were performed as described above. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 μM PDBu and ranged between 25 and 45% of the total in the presence of [3H]PDBu alone. The data were fitted to the theoretical inhibition curve, and the Kd was calculated from the equation Kd = ID50 - L, where ID50 is the concentration of nonradioactive ligand (PDBu) that displaced the binding of the radioligand by 50% and L is the concentration of free radioligand at the ID50.To measure competition of [3H]PDBu binding by different phorbol esters, incubations were performed under similar conditions but using a fixed concentration of [3H]PDBu (4 nM in the presence of phosphatidylserine and 100 nM in the absence of phosphatidylserine) and increasing concentrations of the nonradioactive ligand. In a typical competition assay, 6-8 different concentrations (in triplicate) of the competing ligand were used. The ID50 was determined for the competition curve in each case, and the Ki for the competing ligand was calculated by using the relationship Ki = ID50/(1 + L/Kd), where Kd is the dissociation constant for [3H]PDBu under the specific assay condition and L is the concentration of free radioligand at the ID50. In general, triplicate determinations differed by <10%.RESULTSUsing intact recombinant PKC δ expressed in Sf9 cells with the baculovirus system (3Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar) we noted a low amount of [3H]PDBu binding in the absence of added phosphatidylserine (Fig. 2A). Although small, this specific binding was significantly above background (p < 0.001). One explanation was that [3H]PDBu could indeed bind to PKC in the absence of phospholipid but only did so with greatly reduced affinity. Although contrary to the generally accepted view in the field (12Nelsestuen G.L. Bazzi M.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1991; 23: 43-61PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4018) Google Scholar), this explanation would fit both with the biochemical expectation that PKC per se must provide a partial binding site for its ligand as well as with experimental findings, outlined under “Conclusion,” of phorbol ester modulation of PKC properties in the absence of ligand.Figure 2:[3H]PDBu binding to PKC δ.

For comparison, the binding affinity in the presence of phosphatidylserine was 160-fold greater (Kd = 1.0 ± 0.2 nM, n = 3) (Fig. 2C). A concern in the interpretation of these findings was whether the low affinity binding could represent an artifact arising from lipid remaining in the preparation during purification.A powerful approach to deal with this issue was to use the recombinant cysteine-rich region of PKC δ, a preparation that could be lipid extracted and then refolded again in aqueous solution. A single cysteine-rich region of PKC is the minimum element of the enzyme required for phorbol ester binding(9Quest A.F.G. Bardes E.S.G. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

Initial experiments using 10 nM [3H]PDBu and 0.5 nM HPLC-purified cysteine-rich region showed that phosphatidylserine was required for efficient reconstitution of high affinity ligand binding (Fig. 2B). The ED50 for phosphatidylserine was 15 ± 2 μg/ml (n = 4), and the maximum binding was achieved at 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine (data not shown). The stoichiometry for [3H]PDBu binding was 0.2, similar to that reported by Bell and co-workers in a recent paper (9Quest A.F.G. Bardes E.S.G. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2953-2960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dissociation constant (Kd) for binding of [3H]PDBu to the cysteine-rich region in the presence of 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, using a 1 nM concentration of the receptor, was 1.9 ± 0.1 nM (Fig. 3A, Table I). A similar Kd (2.3 ± 0.1 nM, n = 4) was found by competing a fixed concentration of [3H]PDBu (3 nM) with nonradioactive PDBu (data not shown).Figure 3:[3H]PDBu binding to the second cysteine-rich region of PKC δ.

The Bmax value in the absence of phospholipids was 83 ± 2% (n = 3) of that in the presence of phosphatidylserine. The slight decrease in recovered binding activity appears to reflect absorption to the walls of the incubation tube. Similar results were obtained with a glutathione S-transferase-fused cysteine-rich region. In this latter case, the Kd values for [3H]PDBu in the presence and absence of phosphatidylserine were 0.8 ± 0.1 nM (n = 3) and 69 ± 20 nM (n = 2), respectively. Although the absolute Kd values seem to be slightly lower for the glutathione S-transferase-fusion protein than for the nonfusion protein, the shift in affinity remained the same (Kd ratio = 86). As described in earlier studies with recombinant PKC isozymes(3Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar), the kinetics of [3H]PDBu binding was very fast at 37°C, and maximum levels were attained at 2-5 min either in the presence or absence of phospholipids. [3H]PDBu binding remained at a plateau for up to 30 min in the absence of phospholipids. In the presence of phosphatidylserine about 25% loss in [3H]PDBu binding was found after 30 min of incubation. Experiments using glutathione S-transferase-fused cysteine-rich regions in which the cysteine residue at position 17 or 42 was replaced by glycine by site-directed mutagenesis showed no specific [3H]PDBu binding either in the presence or absence of phospholipids (data not shown).2 2M. G. Kazanietz, S. Wang, G. W. A. Milne, N. E. Lewin, H. L. Lin, and P. M. Blumberg, manuscript in preparation. We confirmed that our measured binding of [3H]PDBu to the cysteine-rich region of PKC δ in the absence of phospholipid reflected complex formation during the initial incubation at 37°C. The Kd was independent of the volume of polyethylene glycol added after chilling of the complex (data not shown). Were either re-equilibration to have occurred at 0°C or were the binding to have been a consequence of precipitate formation, then the Kd should have reflected the final [3H]PDBu concentration after polyethylene glycol addition. We had previously shown that the slow rate of [3H]PDBu release at 0°C from the intact receptor in the presence of lipid is too slow to permit re-equilibration(21Dunphy W.G. Kochenburger R.J. Castagna M. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 2640-2647PubMed Google Scholar).In order to rule out the presence of contaminating lipids that might be responsible for the observed phorbol ester binding we performed a series of controls. First, the binding was not dependent on the specific carrier protein used for precipitation. Similar [3H]PDBu binding was obtained in the absence of phospholipids when either DNase or lysozyme was used instead of bovine IgG (data not shown). Likewise, the cysteine-rich region bound [3H]PDBu equally well in the absence of added phospholipid when the carrier was bovine IgG that had been subjected to lipid extraction (3 times) with chloroform. In order to test the efficiency of this extraction procedure we measured the recovery after the extraction of radiolabeled arachidonic acid and phosphatidylserine added to the IgG solution (about 1 × 106 cpm in each case). The solvent extraction removed 100% of the added [3H]arachidonic acid and >90% of the added [14C]phosphatidylserine. Finally, elemental analysis of the IgG revealed an upper limit for phosphorus of 0.000875% in the preparation (analysis performed by Galbraith Laboratories, Knoxville, TN). If we assumed that phosphorus was present at this limit of detection and was all attributable to phospholipids and that phosphatidylserine represented 20% of the total phospholipid, then phosphatidylserine would not be present after chloroform extraction at a concentration above 0.01 μg/ml. This concentration of phosphatidylserine is well below that required for supporting phorbol ester binding (data not shown).Structure-activity analysis with a series of phorbol esters revealed that the different analogs tested also bound with lower potency to the cysteine-rich region of PKC δ in the absence of phospholipids (Table I). The ratios between the affinities in the absence and in the presence of phosphatidylserine differed for the different phorbol esters. Monoesters such as phorbol 12-decanoate and phorbol 13-decanoate, as well as the 12-deoxyphorbol derivative prostratin (12-deoxyphorbol 13-acetate), showed a smaller loss of affinity in the absence of phospholipids than did the phorbol 12,13-diesters. We conclude that structure-activity relations differ depending on the absence or presence of the phospholipid cofactor.CONCLUSIONSince the discovery of PKC it has been considered that phospholipids are essential cofactors for the activation of the enzyme. The most effective of the naturally occurring phospholipids is phosphatidylserine, although all of the anionic phospholipids display cofactor activity(15Konig B. DiNitto P.A. Blumberg P.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 27: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Early studies from different laboratories including ours (2Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9341-9347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Konig B. DiNitto P.A. Blumberg P.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 27: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) likewise showed that the binding of phorbol esters and related ligands to PKC was dependent on the presence of phospholipids. In the present study we could clearly characterize phorbol ester binding to their receptor in the absence of phospholipids, although with a lower affinity. By using PKC δ expressed in baculovirus we found that the intact enzyme bound [3H]PDBu with an affinity of 165 nM in the absence of phospholipid. The dissociation constant was about 160-fold higher than that obtained in the presence of phosphatidylserine. Likewise, using the recombinant cysteine-rich region of PKC δ we showed [3H]PDBu binding in the absence of phospholipid, with a 80-fold difference in affinity. Crucial technical features of the present experiments are that by using the recombinant cysteine-rich region of PKC δ we could achieve the high receptor levels necessary for the assays. Furthermore, using the recombinant cysteine-rich region of PKC δ we could highly purify this peptide by HPLC in the presence of organic solvents, avoiding any ambiguities concerning contamination with lipid in partially purified intact PKC purified under less harsh conditions.Although this is the first study that demonstrated phospholipid-independent phorbol ester binding to PKC, some previous reports in the literature had suggested that phorbol esters could induce phospholipid-independent effects. Nakadate and Blumberg (22Nakadate T. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 6537-6542PubMed Google Scholar) observed a low level of PKC activation by PDBu in the absence of any phospholipid cofactor. In addition, DaSilva et al.(23Da Silva C. Fan X. Martelly I. Castagna M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2081-2087PubMed Google Scholar) presented evidence for phospholipid-free activation of rat brain PKC by phorbol esters measured as increases in both phosphotransferase activity and autophosphorylation. Finally, a recent report by Weinstein and co-workers (24Luo J-H. Kahn S. O'Driscoll K. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3715-3719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate enhanced calcium binding to the regulatory domain of PKC β-1 in the absence of phosphatidylserine. Although most of these studies did not rigorously rule out the presence of lipids that could support phorbol ester binding, they further corroborate the concept of a phospholipid-independent interaction between PKC and phorbol esters.Our findings have three conceptual implications. First, they relate to the mechanism of PKC translocation by phorbol esters. The observation that insoluble phorbol esters, e.g. phorbol 12,13-dioleate, still bound to PKC had argued that PKC recognized membrane-associated ligand(18Sharkey N.A. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 19-24PubMed Google Scholar). A similar conclusion of course follows from the binding activity of natural diacylglycerols, which are also insoluble in aqueous solution. Those findings had suggested that translocation did not represent the induced association of PKC with the membrane but rather represented a reduced rate of release of PKC from the membrane, causing net accumulation. Our findings that phorbol esters can bind to PKC in the absence of phospholipid now suggest that induction of transfer of PKC to the membrane is also possible. Although these distinct mechanisms do not make different predictions regarding the equilibrium binding constant, they make different predictions about rate. It is perhaps relevant that different ligands differ markedly in the rates of PKC translocation that they induce(26Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Smith C.B. Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. Pettit G.R.

To clarify the relationship between the lectin property and the lipid binding activity of rat SP-D, we expressed wild-type recombinant rat SP-D (rSP-D) and a mutant form of the protein with substitutions Glu-321 → Gln and Asn-323 → Asp (SP-DE321Q,N323D) in CHO-K1 cells. The indicated mutations have previously been shown to change the carbohydrate binding specificity of surfactant protein A and mannose-binding protein from mannose > galactose to the converse. rSP-D expressed in mammalian cells was essentially identical to native rat SP-D in its lipid and carbohydrate binding properties.

https://openalex.org/W2027987608,"A family of GTP-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) transduces signals across the plasma membrane from a large number of receptors to a smaller number of effectors. Recent studies indicate that a series of post-translational modifications are required for their association with the plasma membrane and for their function. In the case of the G protein γ subunits, the post-translational modifications include the prenylation of a cysteine residue within a carboxyl-terminal CAAX motif. Although prenylation has been shown to involve the addition of either a C15 farnesyl or a C20 geranylgeranyl group to proteins, the structural requirements and functional consequences of adding different types of prenyl groups to various members of the γ subunit family have not been examined.

Although the amino acid composition of the CAAX motif appears to play the major role in determining whether certain proteins of the Ras superfamily are recognized by FTase or GGTase I(10Kinsella B.T.

Moreover, the functional consequences of adding different types of prenyl groups to this family of proteins remains to be elucidated. This is of particular interest in view of the importance of prenylation not only for membrane association(12Muntz K.H. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1422-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One way to explore the structural requirements of prenylation is to express the G protein γ subunits in the baculovirus system. In previous papers, the baculovirus system has been shown to permit the individual expression of the γ subunits and to possess the enzymes needed to carry out their prenylation and carboxyl methylation(19Graber S.G.

In the present paper, we have employed this system to study the structural requirements for prenylation of the γ1, γ2, and γ2(Ser-71) subunits. We show that the γ2 subunit is modified exclusively by a geranylgeranyl group, whereas the γ1 and γ2(Ser-71) subunits are modified by varying proportions of farnesyl and geranylgeranyl groups in this system. This has important ramifications for use of γ subunits expressed in this system for functional studies. Furthermore, using chimeric γ subunits, we provide evidence indicating that prenyltransferases of both insect and mammalian origin recognize structural elements of the γ subunits other than the CAAX sequence. For the γ1 subunit(21Hurley J.B. Fong H.K.W. Teplow D.B. Dreyer W.J. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6948-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), a PstI/XbaI fragment containing the entire coding region was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of reverse-transcribed mRNA and was subcloned into the pVL1392 transfer vector. The γ2 subunit (22Robishaw J.D. Kalman V.K. Moomaw C. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15758-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gautam N. Northup J. Baetscher M.

Proulx K.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For the γ2(Ser-71) subunit, a BglII/XbaI fragment containing the entire coding region of the γ2 subunit, except for the substitution of Leu-71 with Ser, was prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification and subcloned into the pVL1392 transfer vector. The γ112, γ211, and γ121 chimeras were prepared and subcloned into pVL1392 and 1393 transfer vectors, as described previously(24Rahmatullah M. Ginnan R. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2946-2951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). All constructs were sequenced to ensure that no changes were introduced by polymerase chain reaction amplification. Recombinant viruses were generated by co-transfection of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells with the recombinant pVL1392 and 1393 transfer vectors along with mutant A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus, as described by the supplier (Pharmigen Corp.). All recombinant viruses were plaque-purified and were verified by their ability to direct the expression of the appropriate proteins, as detected by immunoblotting. The recombinant virus encoding mammalian FTase (25Chen W.J. Moomaw J.F. Overton L. Kost T.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9675-9680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was generously provided by Dr. Thomas Kost, Glaxo Corp. Sf9 insect cells were infected with these recombinant baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 2 for the γ subunits or O.2 for the mammalian FTase. Sf9 insect cells were grown in monolayers or spinners in TNM-FH medium containing 10% fetal calf serum at 27°C. Prior to infection of cells, the medium was supplemented with gentamicin (50 μg/ml) and amphotericin B (2.5 μg/ml). Prenyl Group Determination of γ Subunits Expressed in Sf9 Cells-To assess the specificity of prenylation of the γ subunits, Sf9 cells were infected with viruses encoding the γ1, γ2, or γ2(Ser-71) subunits or chimeras with or without the virus encoding the mammalian FTase. After infection, the cells were maintained in TNM-FH medium containing 10% calf serum. Between 67 and 72 h after infection, the cells were labeled in medium containing 200 μCi [3H]mevalonolactone (MVA), the precursor for the prenylation reaction (DuPont NEN). This labeling period was selected after careful study showing this period of labeling to be representative. In this regard, we compared the ratio of C20versus C15 on the γ subunits in cells labeled with [3H]MVA for 5 or 24 h at either 40 or 67 h after infection. The ratios of C20versus C15 were comparable in each of the four labeling conditions (data not shown). Furthermore, the ratios of C20versus C15 on the γ subunits were not affected by their co-expression with β1 subunit (data not shown). At 72 h after infection, cells were lysed in HME buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors by passage through a 25-gauge needle. To determine the type of prenyl group added to these proteins, lysates were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Segments of gels containing the [3H]MVA-labeled γ subunits were excised and subjected to electroelution. The possibility that the eluted [3H]MVA-labeled γ subunits might be contaminated with endogenous γ subunits derived from Sf9 cells was excluded in a previous paper (19Graber S.G. Figler R.A. Kalman-Maltese V.K. Robishaw J.D. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13123-13128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which showed that there was no incorporation of [3H]MVA into proteins in this region of the gel when lysates from noninfected or wild-type virus-infected Sf9 cells were examined. The [3H]MVA-labeled proteins were precipitated with acetone and solubilized in 8 M guanidine HCl, 0.2 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Prenyl thioether bonds were then disrupted by incubating the proteins with Raney Nickel catalyst, and the released [3H]MVA-labeled prenyl chains were extracted into pentane and reduced over platinum oxide(26Kinsella B.T. Maltese W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8540-8544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radiolabeled hydrocarbons contained in 50 μl (out of approximately 150 μl) of the pentane phase were subjected to high performance gel permeation chromatography as described previously(26Kinsella B.T. Maltese W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8540-8544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Retention times of the [3H]MVA-labeled groups were determined in relation to standards of defined chain length; i.e. 2,6,10-trimethyldodecane (15-carbon farnesane) and 2,6,10,14-tetramethylhexadecane (20-carbon phytane), which were mixed with the samples prior to injection on the column. For the studies described in Fig. 1& 5 and Table I, the yields of 3H-labeled hydrocarbons in the pentane phase averaged 62 ± 6% (mean ± S.E.), based on the acetone-precipitable counts added to the Raney Nickel reaction. Recoveries of injected 3H-labeled hydrocarbons from the column averaged 88 ± 4% (mean ± S.E.).Table IEffect of FTase inhibitor on prenyl modifications of the γ subunitsTable IEffect of FTase inhibitor on prenyl modifications of the γ subunits Sf9 cell lysates prepared from either noninfected cells or cells infected with the mammalian FTase virus were assayed for FTase or GGTase activity by quantitating the amount of 3H label transferred from either [3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) or [3H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) to H-ras or G25K proteins, respectively. Both the H-ras and G25K proteins were obtained as fusion proteins with maltose binding protein following expression in Escherichia coli(27Kinsella B.T. Maltese W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3940-3945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assays were conducted for 1 h at 37°C in a solution consisting of 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 μCi of [3H]FPP or [3H]GGPP, 1 μl of H-ras or G25K fusion protein, and 10 μg of Sf9 cell extract. The assays were stopped by acetone precipitation and the proteins were resolved on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel prior to fluorography. The selective FTase inhibitor, BZA-5B, was generously provided by Dr. James Marsters, Genetech Corp. (28James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Rawson T.E. Somers T.C. McDowell R.S. Crowley C.W. Lucas B.K. Levinson A.D. Marsters J.C. Science. 1993; 260: 1937-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). BZA-5B was dissolved in Me2SO, yielding a 100 mM stock solution. Immediately before use, the stock solution was diluted 1:200 by addition of 10 mM dithiothreitol prepared in phosphate-buffered saline, which was then diluted 1:20 by addition of 1 × Grace's medium. Approximately 65 h after infection with virus, Sf9 cells were treated with BZA-5B at a final concentration of 25 μM BZA-5B, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.025% Me2SO. About 2 h after addition of inhibitor, cells were incubated with [3H]MVA for an additional 4 h. The prenylation of proteins that terminate in CAAX sequences is carried out by distinct prenyltransferases in mammalian cells(9Seabra M.C. Reiss Y. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 429-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 8Moores S.L. Schaber M.D. Mosser S.D. Rands E. O'Hara M.B. Garsky V.M. Marshall M.S. Pompliano D.L. Gibbs J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14603-14610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FTase adds a C15 group to proteins in which X is Ser, whereas GGTase I attaches a C20 moiety to proteins in which X is Leu. To investigate whether the prenyltransferases in insect cells have similar structural requirements, we infected Sf9 insect cells with baculoviruses encoding various γ subunits of the G proteins. Approximately 67 h after infection, cells were labeled with [3H]MVA for 5 h. After treatment of the proteins with Raney Nickel to release the prenyl groups, the 3H-labeled hydrocarbons were analyzed by gel filtration (Fig. 1). The γ2 subunit in which X is Leu was found to be modified by a C20 group following expression in insect cells (upper panel). This result confirms earlier studies showing the γ2 subunit was modified exclusively by a geranylgeranyl moiety in mammalian cells (7Mumby S.M. Casey P.J. Gilman A.G. Gutowski S. Sternweis P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and following expression in insect cells(20Robishaw J.D. Kalman V.K. Proulx K.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To determine whether the nature of the CAAX motif influences the specificity of prenylation in insect cells, we constructed a virus encoding a mutant γ2 subunit (γ2(Ser-71) subunit) in which the Leu in the X position was replaced with Ser. In contrast to the γ2 subunit, the mutant γ2(Ser-71) subunit was found to be modified by a mixture of C15 and C20 groups following expression in insect cells (middle panel). This result suggests that, unlike the γ2 subunit, the mutant γ2(Ser-71) subunit can serve as a substrate for the insect FTase. Thus, the insect FTase recognizes substrates with a CAAX sequence in which X is Ser in a manner analagous to the mammalian FTase(29Reiss Y. Seabra M.C. Armstrong S.A. Slaughter C.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10672-10677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not clear from this result why much of the mutant γ2(Ser-71) subunit was still modified by a C20 group. One possible explanation is that structural elements outside the CAAX sequence might be important for recognition, thereby rendering the γ2(Ser-71) subunit a substrate for both insect FTase and GGTase. To examine this possibility, we infected Sf9 insect cells with a virus encoding the γ1 subunit, which was shown previously to be modified exclusively by a farnesyl moiety in mammalian cells(5Lai R.K. Perez-Sala D. Canada F.J. Rando R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7673-7677Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the γ1 subunit in which X is Ser was also found to be modified by a mixture of C15 and C20 groups in insect cells (lower panel). However, it is noteworthy that the γ2(Ser-71) subunit contained a lower proportion of the C15 group than the γ1 subunit (compare middle and lower panels in Fig. 1). Thus, those γ subunits with the geranylgeranylation target sequence CAAL were modified appropriately with a C20 group, whereas those γ subunits with farnesylation target sequence CAAS were modified inappropriately with both C15 and C20 groups in the baculovirus expression system. These results differ significantly from those obtained on prenylation of other types of proteins with the farnesylation target sequence CAAS in the baculovirus expression system. As shown previously by Buss et al.(30Buss J.E. Quilliam L.A. Kato K. Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Wong G. Clark R. McCormick F. Bokoch G.M. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1523-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the H-Ras protein containing the farnesylation target sequence CVLS was modified appropriately with a C15 moiety in Sf9 insect cells in a manner analagous to mammalian cells. This result was confirmed in the present study by monitoring the ability of Sf9 cell extracts possessing both FTase and GGTase activities to transfer 3H label from either [3H]FPP or [3H]GGPP to the H-Ras fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 2, incorporation of 3H label into the H-Ras protein was detected only in the presence of [3H]FPP. Thus, despite the fact that the γ1 and γ2(Ser-71) subunits and the H-Ras protein both contain a CAAS motif, they appear to behave differently as substrates for the insect prenyltransferases. Taken together, these results raise a number of questions, particularly with regard to the identities and structural requirements of the prenyltransferases responsible for adding the C15versus C20 group to the mutant γ2(Ser-71) and γ1 subunits. From the results described above, it is not clear whether the insect FTase or GGTase was responsible for the addition of the C20 moiety to the γ2(Ser-71) and γ1 subunits. To examine this question, we treated Sf9 cells with the compound BZA-5B, which has been shown to be a highly selective inhibitor of the mammalian FTase(28James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Rawson T.E. Somers T.C. McDowell R.S. Crowley C.W. Lucas B.K. Levinson A.D. Marsters J.C. Science. 1993; 260: 1937-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). To compare the inhibitory activity of BZA-5B on the insect FTase and GGTase, Sf9 cells were cultured in the presence of 0, 25, or 50 μM BZA-5B for 2 h. Subsequently, cell extracts prepared from these cultures were assayed for FTase or GGTase activity by monitoring the transfer of 3H label from [3H]FPP or [3H]GGPP to H-Ras protein containing the farnesylation target sequence CVLS or G25K protein containing the geranylgeranylation target sequence CVLL, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, BZA-5B completely inhibited the transfer of [3H]FPP to H-Ras protein at a concentration of 25 or 50 μM (compare lanes 1-3), without affecting the transfer of [3H]GGPP to G25K protein (compare lanes 4-6). Thus, BZA-5B was able to selectively inhibit the insect FTase in a manner analogous to the mammalian FTase. To study the effect of this compound on prenylation in vivo, we infected Sf9 cells with virus encoding the γ1 subunit. Approximately 65 h after infection, cells were treated with 0 or 25 μM BZA-5B for 2 h and then labeled with [3H]MVA for 4 h. Equal amounts of protein from untreated and BZA-5B-treated cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the 3H-labeled protein(s) were visualized by fluorography. Prenylation of the γ1 subunit was visualized by fluorography and quantitated by scintillation counting of the excised gel slice containing the labeled γ1 subunit. As shown in Table I, BZA-5B markedly decreased prenylation of the γ1 subunit by 42 or 61% in two separate experiments. To determine whether the inhibitory effect of BZA-5B represented loss of the C15 or the C20 moiety from the γ1 subunit, equal amounts of protein from untreated and BZA-5B-treated cells were incubated with Raney Nickel, and the 3H-labeled hydrocarbons were analyzed by gel filtration. As shown in Table I, BZA-5B drastically reduced the proportion of C15 versus C20 chains in the prenyl mixture extracted from the γ1 subunit in two separate experiments. Moreover, from the distribution of [3H]MVA between C15 and C20, it is apparent that the overall decline in radiolabeling of the γ1 subunit was due mainly to the loss of the C15 modification with little or no decrease in the C20 modification. Taken together, these results indicate that GGTase I, rather than FTase, is responsible for the addition of the C20 group to the γ1 subunit following its expression in insect cells. Thus, despite the presence of a farnesylation target sequence CVIS, the γ1 subunit is a substrate for both the FTase and GGTase I in insect cells. Furthermore, since the fraction of the γ1 subunit modified with the C15 group was drastically decreased, but the fraction modified with the C20 group was not significantly increased, this suggests that the insect GGTase I is operating at its maximal rate on this substrate. One possible explanation for the existence of two types of prenyl modification on γ1 is that attachment of the C20 group to the γ1 subunit could be favored by a preponderance of GGTase I activity compared to FTase activity in insect cells. If so, one might expect that increased expression of FTase might result in a decline in the C20 modification of γ1 due to competition between FTase and GGTase I for available substrate protein. Accordingly, we examined whether overexpression of the mammalian FTase in insect cells could increase the proportion of the γ1 subunit that was modified with the C15 moiety. As shown in Fig. 4, infection of Sf9 insect cells with virus encoding the α and β subunits of the mammalian FTase resulted (25Chen W.J. Moomaw J.F. Overton L. Kost T.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9675-9680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a large increase in enzyme activity. Comparison of the enzyme activity in soluble fractions prepared from either noninfected cells or cells infected with the mammalian FTase virus revealed more than a 15-fold increase in the ability to farnesylate the H-Ras fusion protein. Moreover, as shown in Table II, co-infection of Sf9 insect cells with the mammalian FTase virus along with the γ1 virus resulted in a large increase in the proportion of the γ1 subunit that was modified with the C15 moiety, although some of the C20 group was still transferred to the protein. In contrast, co-infection of Sf9 insect cells with the mammalian FTase virus along with the γ2(Ser-71) virus showed no significant increase in the proportion of the γ2(Ser-71) subunit that was modified with the C15 moiety. Thus, the mutant γ2(Ser-71) subunit was a much less effective substrate for the mammalian FTase than was the γ1 subunit, despite both subunits having a farnesylation target sequence CAAS. This result, along with the observation that a smaller fraction of the γ2(Ser-71) subunit was modified with the C15 moiety compared with the γ1 subunit (Fig. 1), raises the distinct possibility that elements outside the CAAX motif must be important for recognition of these proteins by the FTases of both mammalian and insect origin.Table IIPrenyl modification of γ subunits: effect of overexpression of mammalian FTase in insect cellsTable IIPrenyl modification of γ subunits: effect of overexpression of mammalian FTase in insect cells From earlier studies on the Ras protein family, it was concluded that the CAAX motif was sufficient for recognition of these proteins by the appropriate prenyltransferases(11Cox A.D. Hisaka M.M. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2606-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 31Hancock J.F. Cadwaller K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). However, the results of these studies differ significantly from those obtained on the γ subunits with a similar farnesylation target sequence CAAS in the present paper (Fig. 1 and Table II), raising the distinct possibility that structural elements other than the CAAX motif might be important for recognition of the γ subunits by the FTases and GGTases of both mammalian and insect origin. To investigate this possibility, we examined the ability of the COOH-terminal, middle, and NH2-terminal domains of the γ subunit to affect the type of prenyl modification added to these proteins. As shown in Fig. 5, the γ112 chimera possessing the COOH-terminal domain of the γ2 subunit and the NH2-terminal and middle domains of the γ1 subunit was modified exclusively with a C20 moiety (upper panel), consistent with this chimera having a predicted geranylgeranylation target sequence CAAL sequence at its COOH terminus. The reciprocal γ211 chimera possessing the NH2-terminal domain of the γ2 subunit and the middle and COOH-terminal domains of the γ1 subunit was modified predominantly with a C15 moiety (middle panel), again consistent with this chimera having a predicted farnesylation target sequence CAAS at its COOH terminus. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the γ211 chimera appears to be a better substrate for the FTase than the wild-type γ1 subunit (compare Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:). However, of most interest, the γ121 chimera having the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of the γ1 subunit and the middle domain of the γ2 subunit was modified predominantly with a C20 moiety (lower panel), despite this chimera having a predicted farnesylation target sequence CAAS. This result provides direct evidence that structural elements other than the CAAX sequence are important for the recognition of the γ subunits by the appropriate prenyltransferases and points to the importance of a 31-amino acid region in the middle of these proteins. Within this region of the γ2 subunit (from amino acid 16 to 46), there are only 15 nonconserved amino acid differences between the γ2 and γ1 subunits, further defining the particular residues involved in recognition. At the present time, it is not clear whether the greater incorporation of 3H counts into the γ112 chimera compared with the γ211 and the γ121 chimeras is due to higher expression of the γ112 protein or because the γ112 protein is a better substrate for prenylation. With the growing awareness that the G protein βγ subunits play an active role in receptor-effector coupling and receptor desensitization (for reviews, see Refs. 1Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 631-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 2Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, and 32Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 869-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), it is of particular interest to examine the ability of different types of βγ subunits to regulate adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase C, phospholipase A2, ion channels, and receptor kinase activities. Such studies have not been possible previously because of the difficulty in resolving the heterogeneous mixtures of βγ subunits that are present in tissues and because of the probable existence of as yet undescribed β and γ subunits in these tissues. With the recent identification of at least five β subunits (33vonWeizacker E. Strathmann M.P. Simon M.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Quilliam L.A. Kato K. Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Wong G. Clark R. McCormick F. Bokoch G.M. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1523-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 38Lowe P.N. Sydenham M. Page M.J. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1045-1048PubMed Google Scholar), including prenylation and carboxyl methylation, that are required for the function of the γ subunits. However, despite the widespread use of the baculovirus expression system for the production of these βγ subunits, studies to examine whether the γ subunits are being appropriately processed in this system have been limited to the γ2 subunit(20Robishaw J.D. Kalman V.K. Proulx K.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is now well established that two different types of prenyl moieties (farnesyl and geranylgeranyl) can be added to proteins terminating in CAAX sequences, with the amino acid residue in the X position playing a major role in determining which type of prenyl group is added. In this regard, mutation of the terminal amino acid in H-Ras from Ser to Leu, or vice versa, has been shown to reverse the type of prenyl group added to these proteins(11Cox A.D. Hisaka M.M. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2606-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 31Hancock J.F. Cadwaller K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). From these earlier studies, it was concluded that the CAAX motif was the principal determinant for recognition of Ras and Ras-related proteins by the appropriate prenyltransferases. The results of the present study show that in many respects the insect FTase and GGTase I have structural requirements that are similar to those of their mammalian counterparts. Thus, the insect FTase catalyzes the addition of a C15 farnesyl moiety to the γ1 and γ2(Ser-71) subunits ending in Ser, whereas the insect GGTase I catalyzes the attachment of a C20 geranylgeranyl moiety to the γ2 subunit ending in Leu. Surprisingly, however, we observed that in Sf9 cells, C20 groups are also attached to the γ1 and γ2(Ser-71) subunits ending in Ser. We speculate that the alternative modification of the CAAS proteins is catalyzed by the insect GGTase I, since it is not substantially suppressed by an inhibitor of FTase (). The possibility that GGTase I can exhibit cross-specificity under certain circumstances is further supported by recent data in yeast showing that ram1 null mutants lacking FTase activity are still able to prenylate some RAS, presumably by addition of geranylgeranyl group in a reaction catalyzed by GGTase I(39He B. Chen P. Chen S.Y. Vancura K.L. Michaelis S. Powers S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11373-11377Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The possibility that sequences other than the CAAX motif may play a role in determining the specificity of prenylation of some proteins has been raised by recent studies of Rho proteins (40Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and yeast mating factor(41Caldwell G.A. Wang S.H. Naider F. Becker J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1275-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is noteworthy that in the present study, overexpression of mammalian FTase in Sf9 cells increased the proportion of the γ1 that underwent C15 modification, but did not similarly increase the proportion of total radioactivity migrating as C15 in the γ2(Ser-71) mutant. One possible interpretation of this finding is that the γ2(Ser-71) is not as good a substrate for mammalian FTase as γ1, because it lacks key elements outside the CAAX sequence that may be important for FTase recognition. Although the precise location of such upstream recognition domains remains to be defined, the present study provides two lines of evidence suggesting that both the NH2-terminal and central region of the γ1 sequence are involved. First, we show that, contrary to expectations, replacing the NH2-terminal domain of γ1 with the corresponding domain from γ2 (amino acids 1-15) results in an increased proportion of the γ211 chimera being modified by the C15 farnesyl moiety in Sf9 cells. Second, we show that substituting the central domain of γ1 with the corresponding region from γ2 (amino acids 16-46) alters the type of prenyl group added to the γ121 chimera from the C15 farnesyl moiety to the C20 geranylgeranyl moiety. Thus, although the presence of a CAAX motif is sufficient for prenylation of the γ subunit family, it appears that elements other than the CAAX sequence are influential in determining the specificity of the modification. Whether this means that distinct prenyltransferases are responsible for modifying the G protein γ subunits and proteins such as H-Ras remains unclear. However, to date, only one FTase and one GGTase I have been cloned from mammalian cells. Finally, it is interesting to note that the general region upstream of the CAAX sequence that appears to influence the specificity of prenylation of the γ subunits includes a 14-amino acid region previously shown to be important in conferring the specificity of association with the β subunits(42Spring D.J. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22882-22886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since Higgins and Casey (43Higgins J.B. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 269: 9067-9073Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that prenylation of the γ subunits is not required for βγ assembly in vitro, one might speculate that prenylation of the γ subunits may actually precede their association with the β subunits in vivo. This will be an important topic for future investigation. The present study has important implications for the use of the baculovirus expression system to produce various βγ subunits for functional studies. Thus, with the realization that the baculovirus-expressed γ1 subunit is inappropriately modified by both farnesyl and geranylgeranyl moieties, it is not clear whether the observed functional differences between the expressed β1γ1 and β1γ2 subunits that have been identified in terms of interaction with G protein α subunits and effectors (15Iiguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23409-23417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Ueda N. Iiguez-Lluhi J.A. Lee E. Smrcka A.V. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4388-4395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are due to differences in the primary structures of the γ subunits, the type of prenyl group added to these proteins, or some combination of both. Since studies in yeast have suggested that only the farnesylated, but not the geranylgeranylated, form of the Ras protein is capable of stimulating adenylyl cyclase(17Marshall M.S. Davis L.J. Keys R.D. Mosser S.D. Hill W.S. Scolnick E.M. Gibbs J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3997-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it will be of particular interest to examine this question more closely. In this regard, the ability to express and purify particular γ subunits modified by either a farnesyl or geranylgeranyl group in the baculovirus system should allow the contribution of the prenyl group to be assessed in terms of βγ interaction with Gα proteins, receptors, receptor kinases, and effectors. The feasibility of this approach is supported by data in the present study showing the use of FTase inhibitors and/or overexpression of FTase to manipulate the proportion of protein modified by either a farnesyl or geranylgeranyl group in this system. Thus, in future studies, it should be possible to design studies to allow the contribution of the prenyl group to be accurately assessed. Finally, it is generally assumed that other members of the γ subunit family with CAAX motifs terminating in Leu will be modified by a geranylgeranyl group. However, this assumption has yet to be confirmed in any mammalian or baculovirus expression system. With the realization in the present study that sequences outside the CAAX motif are important in determining the type of prenyl group added to this family of proteins, it will be important to examine the validity of this assumption. In this regard, it is noteworthy that Rho proteins terminating in Leu can be modified by both farnesyl and geranylgeranyl groups, depending on presence or absence of specific amino acids upstream of the CAAX motif(40Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it will be of interest in future studies to determine the type of prenyl group attached to other members of the γ subunit family, particularly a newly identified γ11 subunit that contains a predicted farnesylation target sequence.1 The recombinant virus encoding the α and β subunits of farnesyl transferase was generously provided by Dr. Thomas Kost, Glaxo Corp.

An interesting feature of the three components of the GP Ib-IX complex is that they each contain leucine-rich motifs in their extracellular domains(7López J.A. Chung D.W. Fujikawa K. Hagen F.S.

A fourth platelet membrane glycoprotein, GP V (Mr = 82,000), is an additional member of this family of leucine-rich glycoproteins(10Shimomura T. Fujimura K. Maehama S. Takemoto M. Oda K. Fujimoto T.

All three subunits of the GP Ib-IX complex are missing or are present in significantly decreased amounts in platelets from Bernard-Soulier patients(14Nurden A.T. Dupuis D. Kunicki T.J. Caen J.P. J.

Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) raised the possibility that GP V may be part of a complex with the other three leucine-rich glycoproteins. Evidence that such a complex may exist comes from a report that GP V can be co-immunoprecipitated with GP Ib-IX from platelets lysed with the mild detergent digitonin (19Modderman P.W. Admiraal L.G. Sonnenberg A. von dem Borne A.E.G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 364-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, GP Ib-IX associates with actin-binding protein, thus mediating attachment of this adhesion receptor to the cytoskeleton. Actin-binding protein and GP Ib-IX interact with such high affinity that they remain associated in all of the detergents used to lyse platelets(20Fox J.E.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11970-11977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Okita J.R. Pidard D.

Thus, actin-binding protein and associated cytoskeletal proteins always co-immunoprecipitate with GP Ib-IX from detergent-lysed platelets, making it difficult to determine whether GP V and GP Ib-IX co-immunoprecipitate because they associate directly with each other or because they are both associated with the cytoskeleton.The function of GP V is not known. Because it is cleaved by thrombin, it was originally thought to be the functional thrombin receptor(26Phillips D.R. Agin P.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 75: 940-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 27Mosher D.F. Vaheri A. Choate J.J. Gahmberg C.G. Blood. 1979; 53: 437-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Berndt M.C. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 59-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is now known that it is cleaved from the surface of activated platelets by a protease other than thrombin; thrombin appears to cleave it after it has been removed from the platelet membrane by other mechanisms (for review, see Ref. 29Fox J.E.B. Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis. 1994; 5: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Based on the finding that decreases in GP Ib-IX in patients with Bernard-Soulier syndrome are also accompanied by decreased surface expression of GP V(15Clemetson K.J. McGregor J.L. James E. Dechavanne M. Luscher E.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 16Berndt M.C. Gregory C. Chong B.H. Zola H. Castaldi P.A.

Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it appears possible that GP Ib-IX is required for the expression of GP V on the surface. Conversely, it appears possible that if GP V and GP Ib-IX form a complex, GP V might regulate the expression of the GP Ib-IX subunits on the surface. If so, this would not only provide the first known function of GP V, but it would also raise the possibility that some cases of Bernard-Soulier syndrome could potentially arise from mutations in GP V rather than from mutations in one of the subunits in GP Ib-IX.In the present studies, GP V and GP Ib-IX were expressed in a melanoma cell line that lacks actin-binding protein(30Cunningham C.C.

This approach eliminated the potential problem of GP Ib-IX and GP V co-immunoprecipitating because they are both associated with the cytoskeleton and allowed us to determine whether GP V interacts with GP Ib-IX. Further, confocal microscopy was used to determine whether the glycoproteins co-localize in the intact cell, an approach that is not feasible in platelets because of the small size of the cells. By transfecting cells with combinations of cDNAs coding for the glycoproteins, we have determined whether the expression of one glycoprotein influences the expression of others. We show that GP V interacts directly with GP Ib-IX in the membrane of the cells and that this interaction is needed for the efficient expression of both GP V and GP Ib-IX in the membrane. Further, our studies suggest that GP V increases the binding capacity of the cells for von Willebrand factor by increasing the surface expression of the GP Ib-IX complex.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and TransfectionsThe melanoma cells used in these studies were derived from a human malignant melanoma lacking actin-binding protein(30Cunningham C.C.

The cells were co-transfected with 10 μg of each linearized construct containing the cDNAs encoding GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, and GP IX or GP V and 0.5 μg of an appropriate selection marker. Individual colonies were isolated using a cloning cylinder. About 20 clones were grown and evaluated by flow cytometry for surface expression of the GP Ib-IX complex or GP V. The clones with the higher expression levels of the proteins of interest were used in the experiments described below.In one experiment, as indicated in the text, GP V-expressing cells were transiently transfected with 3 μg of each expression plasmid containing the cDNAs coding for GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, and GP IX and 40 μl of liposome suspension (LipofectAMINE, Life Technologies, Inc.)(33Hawley-Nelson P. Ciccarone V. Gebeyehu G. Jessee J. Felgner P.L. Focus (Gaithersburg, MD). 1993; 15: 73-79Google Scholar).Fluorescence and Confocal MicroscopyThe cells were plated on Lab-Tek tissue culture chamber slides (Nunc, Inc., Naperville, IL), fixed in the absence of detergent, and stained as described previously (31López J.A.

The cells were labeled with a monoclonal antibody against GP Ibα (monoclonal antibody Ib-23 (34Meyer S. Kresbach G. Haring P. Schumpp-Vonach B. Clemetson K.J. Hadváry P. Steiner B. J. Biol.

Phillips, COR Therapeutics Inc., San Francisco, CA). The polyclonal GP V antibody was detected with Texas red-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and the monoclonal GP Ibα antibody was detected with biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated streptavidin (Amersham International plc, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). When the labeling was performed only with the serum against GP V, biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham), and FITC-conjugated streptavidin were used. Fluorescence microscopy was performed on an inverted microscope (DIAPHOT-TMD, Nikon, Japan). Confocal microscopy was performed using a Sarastro 1000 confocal microscope (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).Flow Cytometry and Cell SortingCells were harvested by treatment with 1 mM EDTA (Sigma), washed in PBS, and incubated with the relevant polyclonal or monoclonal antibody for 30 min at 4°C. The cells were washed and then incubated for 30 min at 4°C with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (5 μg/ml in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin) (Vector Laboratories). Following washes, the samples were resuspended in PBS and analyzed by a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). In some cases, cell sorting was performed using a modified FACS 440 cell sorter (Becton Dickinson). The 5% of cells with the highest levels of fluorescence intensity were collected.Western Blot AnalysisCells (2 × 105) were solubilized in 40 μl of Laemmli sample buffer(35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205982) Google Scholar), and solubilized proteins were electrophoresed through a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose paper(36Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44703) Google Scholar), which was incubated with a serum against GP V or with a monoclonal antibody against GP Ibα, monoclonal antibody Ib-4 (34Meyer S.

The nitrocellulose paper was sequentially incubated with either a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG or an anti-mouse IgG and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham). The signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using Amersham's ECL system.Co-immunoprecipitation of GP Ib-IX with GP VPolyclonal antibodies against GP V or rabbit IgG (Sigma) were covalently coupled to polyacrylamide immunobeads (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA) (average diameter, 10 μm) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were harvested with EDTA, washed twice with PBS and lysed in an ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% digitonin (Sigma), 5 mM CaCl2 (Sigma), 1 mg/ml DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim), 1 mg/ml leupeptin (Vega Biotechnologies, Tucson, AZ), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 50 mM benzamidine (Sigma), 1 mM sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ), 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) for 1 h at 4°C under agitation (2.5 × 106 cells/ml of lysis buffer). The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant (1 ml) was agitated for 1 h at 4°C with 50 μl of rabbit IgG-coupled immunobeads. The beads were sedimented by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 4 min at 4°C. The precleared supernatant was agitated with 50 μl of anti-GP V-coated beads or rabbit IgG-coated beads for 16 h at 4°C. The immunobeads were washed four times in a buffer similar to the lysis buffer but containing only 0.1% digitonin and lacking DNase I. Immunoprecipitated proteins were removed from the beads by boiling the samples in an SDS-containing buffer (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205982) Google Scholar) and were analyzed on Western blots.Binding of Botrocetin-induced von Willebrand Factor to the Transfected CellsPurified vWf (generously provided by Dr. J. Moake, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) (37Moake J.L. Turner N.A. Stathopoulos N.A. Nolasco L.H. Hellums J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1456-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) was labeled by the lactoperoxidase method(38Marchalonis J.J. Biochem. J. 1969; 113: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). The cells (105 cells in 400 μl of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin) were incubated in the presence of 5 μg/ml botrocetin (Pentapharm, Basel, Switzerland), and various concentrations of 125I-labeled vWf (specific activity approximately 6 × 106 cpm/μg). Samples were rocked gently at room temperature for 1 h. 225-μl aliquots were removed and layered onto 400 μl of ice-cold 30% sucrose in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The samples were centrifuged at 15,600 × g for 4 min at 4°C. The sucrose solution was aspirated carefully, and the amount of 125I-labeled vWf associated with the sedimented cells was determined in a γ counter (Iso-Data, Rolling Meadows, IL). Nonspecific binding at each vWf concentration was determined by measuring 125I-labeled vWf binding to melanoma cells that had not been transfected with GP Ib-IX. These counts were subtracted from those obtained with the corresponding transfected cells. A molecular weight of 1.1 × 106 was assumed for vWf. The data were analyzed by Scatchard analysis.RESULTSTo determine whether GP V associates with GP Ib-IX, cells were stably transfected with the cDNA for GP V and the three cDNAs encoding the subunits of GP Ib-IX (GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, and GP IX). Cells were lysed, and GP V immunoprecipitated from the lysates. Because GP Ib-IX associates with actin-binding protein, thus mediating attachment of this adhesion receptor to the cytoskeleton, actin-binding protein and associated cytoskeletal proteins always co-immunoprecipitate with GP Ib-IX from detergent-lysed cells(20Fox J.E.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11970-11977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Okita J.R. Pidard D.

Chem. 1988; 263: 13303-13309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem, the present experiments were performed using a lysis buffer that included DNase I to depolymerize actin filaments(20Fox J.E.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11970-11977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, when actin filaments are depolymerized and GP Ib-IX is released into the detergent-soluble fraction, the glycoprotein complex remains associated in a high affinity interaction with actin-binding protein(21Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11970-11977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To eliminate the possibility that the glycoproteins co-immunoprecipitate simply because they are both associated with actin-binding protein, the present experiments were performed with a previously described cell line that lacks actin-binding protein(30Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed that GP Ibα co-immunoprecipitated with GP V from these cells (Fig. 1B, lane2). The finding that GP Ib-IX co-immunoprecipitated with GP V even when actin-binding protein was not present indicates that there is a direct interaction of GP V with one or more of the glycoproteins in the GP Ib-IX complex. Some proteolysis of the GP Ibα chain apparently occurred during lysis of the cells yielding a fragment of Mr = 90,000-100,000 (Fig. 1B). This fragment was not immunoprecipitated by a monoclonal antibody that blocked von Willebrand factor binding to GP Ibα (monoclonal antibody Ib-23) (data not shown), suggesting that it represented GP Ibα that has been cleaved at a protease-sensitive site in the extracellular amino-terminal end of the molecule(39Fox J.E.B. Aggerbeck L.P. Berndt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4882-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This fragment lacks the 45-kDa domain that contains the leucine-rich repeats and the ligand-binding site(7López J.A. Chung D.W. Fujikawa K. Hagen F.S. Papayannopoulou T. Roth G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Each micrograph represents a thin optical section through the cells. There was a precise co-localization of GP V (Fig. 2A) with GP Ibα (Fig. 2B).Figure 2:Confocal microscopy images showing co-localization of GP Ib-IX and GP V in the membrane of transfected cells.

Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we wanted to know whether GP V expression requires the presence of the GP Ib-IX complex. Melanoma cells were stably transfected with the cDNA encoding GP V alone. In these and all subsequent experiments, melanoma cells that were expressing actin-binding protein were used. Analysis of solubilized cells on Western blots showed that even in the absence of GP Ib-IX, GP V was synthesized and had a molecular weight(82, 0) similar to that of the protein in platelets (Fig. 3, left panel,lane2). As shown by FACS analysis (Fig. 3, right panel,dashedline) and immunofluorescence of nonpermeabilized cells (Fig. 4B), some GP V was incorporated into the membrane. To determine whether the surface expression of GP V was more efficient if the three subunits of the GP Ib-IX complex were present, the synthesis and surface expression of GP V was also examined in a clone of cells that had been stably transfected with the cDNAs for GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, and GP IX in addition to GP V. Even though this clone synthesized considerably less GP V than the clone that had been transfected with the cDNA for GP V alone (Fig. 3, left panel, compare lane3 with lane2, and Table I), more GP V was expressed on the surface of these cells (Fig. 3, right panel, compare solidline with dashedline). These results suggest that in the absence of GP Ib-IX intact GP V exists within the cell but that it is more efficiently incorporated into the cell membrane when the GP Ib-IX complex is present. To directly test this idea, a clone of cells expressing GP V alone was transiently transfected with the three cDNAs encoding GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, and GP IX. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. The expression of GP Ib-IX was verified by flow cytometry (data not shown). Fig. 5 shows that after addition of GP Ib-IX, GP V reached the surface at levels significantly higher (solidline) than those that existed prior to GP Ib-IX addition (dashedline). When GP V was expressed alone, a large amount of protein with the same molecular weight as intact GP V was also found in the cell culture medium (Table I). The amount of GP V in the medium, relative to the amount in the cells, was markedly decreased when GP Ib-IX was also present (Table I).Figure 3:Western blots and FACS analysis showing that full-length GP V is expressed in transfected cells but that little is expressed in the membrane unless GP Ib-IX is also present.

We demonstrate that oligodeoxyribonucleotides and peptide nucleic acid oligomers hybridize to inverted repeats within duplex DNA by D-loop formation. Oligonucleotides and duplex template form an active complex, which can be recognized by T7 DNA polymerase to prime polymerization. Quantitation of polymerization products allowed the rate of hybridization to be estimated, and peptide nucleic acid oligomers and oligonucleotide-protein adducts anneal with association constants 500- and 12,000-fold greater, respectively, than the analogous unmodified oligonucleotides. Together, these results indicate that sequences within duplex DNA can be targeted by Watson-Crick base pairing and that chemical modifications can dramatically enhance the rate of strand association. These findings should facilitate targeting of oligomers for priming DNA polymerization, the detection of diagnostic sequences, and the disruption of gene expression.

Previously, we found a serine protease trapped in α2-macroglobulin in the cytosol fraction of porcine gastric mucosa and suggested the possibility of its participation in the processing or degradation of certain bioactive peptides(4Uchino T. Sakurai Y. Nishigai M. Takahashi T. Arakawa H. Ikai A. Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 527-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, due to its apparent instability after release from α2-macroglobulin, no extensive characterization has been made so far. We also suggested similar roles for gastric cathepsin E at neutral pH(5Athauda S.B.P. Takahashi T. Inoue H. Ichinose M. Takahashi K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).

All steps were performed at 4°C unless otherwise specified. Fresh porcine stomachs were washed well with chilled 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.2) containing 0.27 M sucrose, and the antral mucosa (77 g) was carefully scraped and homogenized in 5 volumes of 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.2) containing 0.27 M sucrose, 1 mM PMSF, and 10 μM leupeptin (TS-PL buffer) first in a Waring blender (15 s × three times) and then in a Teflon homogenizer.

The metrizamide stepwise gradient was composed of 0.10 M (5 ml), 0.15 M (5 ml), 0.23 M (5 ml), 0.3 M (8 ml), and 0.4 M (5 ml) metrizamide in 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.2) and 1 mM EDTA, and the final osmolarity was adjusted with sucrose solution to 300 mosm/kg(10Loh Y.P. Tam W.W.H. Russell J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8238-8245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 10 ml of the vesicle fraction was layered on the metrizamide-sucrose stepwise gradient. After centrifugation for 1.5 h at 100,000 × g (Hitachi RPS 27-2 rotor), 1.5-ml fractions were collected from the bottom. [3H]DFP Labeling of Pancreatic Trypsin-50 μg of pancreatic trypsin was incubated for 2 h at 37°C in 100 μl of a reaction mixture containing 40 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.2), 1 mM CaCl2, and 1 MBq of [1,3-3H]DFP. After addition of 4.2 μl of 5 M NaCl, the solution was applied to a NAP™-5 (Sephadex G-25) column (0.9 × 2.8 cm) equilibrated with 40 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.2), 0.2 M NaCl, and 1 mM CaCl2. Radioactivity of each fraction was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Aloka model LSC700), and the radioactive fractions containing [3H]DFP-labeled pancreatic trypsin were also analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The [3H]DFP-labeled pancreatic trypsin was used as an exogenous authentic enzyme. Subcellular Fractionation of the Antral Mucosa Supplemented with Exogenous [3H]DFP-labeled Pancreatic Trypsin-[3H]DFP-labeled pancreatic trypsin (corresponding to the radioactivity of 0.2 MBq) was supplemented additionally to 5 g of fresh antral mucosa, and the mucosa was homogenized in 5 volumes of TS-PL buffer. The subcellular fractionation was done as described above under the “Subcellular Fractionation” section except that each pellet of vesicle or microsome fraction was not washed. Radioactivity of the vesicle, microsome, and cytosol fractions was analyzed. Density Gradient Centrifugation of the Cellular Fractions Containing Exogenous [3H]DFP-labeled Pancreatic Trypsin-It was analyzed using metrizamide-sucrose or sucrose density gradient fractionation to investigate whether the exogenous [3H]DFP-labeled pancreatic trypsin can associate with vesicular and ER-microsomal membrane components. Sucrose or metrizamide-sucrose density gradient fractionation of the vesicle or microsome fraction was done as described above under the “Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation” and “Metrizamide-Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation” sections except that the vesicle or microsome fraction prepared from the antral mucosa containing exogenous [3H]DFP-labeled pancreatic trypsin was used as a sample. All enzymatic reactions were done at 37°C. The trypsin-like protease activity was assayed by incubation for 60 min in 200 μl of a reaction mixture containing 0.1 mMt-butyloxycarbonyl(Boc)-Gln-Gly-Arg-MCA, 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.8), and 1 mM CaCl2. After addition of 1 ml of the stop solution containing 100 mM sodium chloroacetate, 20 mM sodium acetate, and 0.4%(v/v) acetic acid, the amount of AMC produced was measured fluorometrically with an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm in a Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer 650-10S. The pH dependence of activity was measured by the same assay method except that Tris-Cl or bis-Tris-propane buffers of respective pH values were used. Aminopeptidase activity was assayed by the method of Usui et al.(11Usui Y. Ohmoto T. Yoshida K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 719: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) with some modifications in 200 μl of a reaction mixture containing 0.1 mM Ala-MCA and 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), and the amount of AMC produced was measured fluorometrically. Acid phosphatase activity was assayed by the modified Lowry's method (12Lowry O.H. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 4: 371-372Google Scholar) with 10 mMp-nitrophenyl phosphate in 500 μl of 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.4). After the reaction for 1 h, 500 μl of 0.2 N NaOH was added, and the absorbance at 410 nm was measured. Glucose-6-phosphatase activity was assayed by the method described by Swanson(13Swanson M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 2: 541-543Crossref Scopus (489) Google Scholar), and the amount of liberated inorganic phosphate was determined by the method of Leloir and Cardini(14Leloir L.F. Cardini C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 840-850Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar). α-Mannosidase activity was assayed by the method of Storrie and Madden(15Storrie B. Madden E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 215-219Google Scholar). Protein was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm of the sample solution or by the method of Smith et al.(16Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano E.K. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olsen B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar) using BCA reagent. The protein finally isolated was microquantitated on SDS-PAGE after silver staining by comparing with pancreatic trypsin inhibitor as a standard protein. Ten volumes of 1% sodium deoxycholate in 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 9.0) was added to the pooled active fraction from the density gradient centrifugation and solubilized by magnetic stirring overnight at 4°C. The solubilized solution was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 9.0), including 0.25% sodium deoxycholate and was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h (Beckman 50.2 Ti rotor). The resulting clear supernatant was applied to a DE52 column (2.0 × 20 cm) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-Cl buffer (pH 9.0) and 0.1% Lubrol PX, and the column was washed with the same buffer and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.5 M of NaCl. To the pooled active fraction was added ammonium sulfate to 30% saturation. This sample was centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g, and the supernatant was applied to a butyl-Toyopearl 650 column (2 × 20 cm) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.8), 0.02% Lubrol PX containing ammonium sulfate at 30% saturation. The column was washed with the same buffer and then eluted with a decreasing gradient of ammonium sulfate (30 to 0% saturation) in a total volume of 800 ml at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The active fractions were pooled and brought to 30% ammonium sulfate saturation. This solution was concentrated through a small column of butyl-Toyopearl to 4 ml and then submitted to gel filtration on a Sepharose CL-6B column (2.5 × 120 cm). Elution was performed with 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.8) containing 0.02% Lubrol PX and 0.2 M NaCl (flow rate, 0.3 ml/min; fraction size, 8 ml). The active fractions were pooled and applied to a benzamidine-Sepharose 6B column (0.8 × 2.5 cm) and eluted with 20 mM Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8.8) containing 50 mM benzamidine hydrochloride, 0.02% Lubrol PX, and 0.5 M NaCl (flow rate, 0.75 ml/min; fraction size, 1 ml). The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8.8), 0.02% Lubrol PX, and benzamidine was completely removed. 500 μl each of the active fractions from the metrizamide-sucrose density gradient centrifugation of the vesicle fraction was added to 4.5 ml of 0.02% Lubrol PX solution. Each solution was frozen, thawed, vortexed five times, and centrifuged for 40 min at 100,000 × g. Each supernatant fraction and porcine pancreatic trypsin as a control enzyme were analyzed in a butyl-Toyopearl 650 chromatograph in which all the buffer solutions for equilibration, washing, and elution of the column were prepared with or without added 0.1%(w/v) Lubrol PX. The butyl-Toyopearl 650 column (0.8 × 1.5 cm) was equilibrated with 40 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.8) containing ammonium sulfate at 30% saturation. The column was washed with the same buffer and then eluted with a decreasing gradient of ammonium sulfate (30 to 0% saturation) in a total volume of 20 ml at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. The concentration of ammonium sulfate in each fraction was measured using a refractometer Type N1 (Atago Co.), comparing the Brix percent of each fraction with each standard concentration of ammonium sulfate in the same buffer. The elution profile was compared as a function of the ammonium sulfate concentration at which each enzyme was eluted. Each peptide (1,000 pmol) was incubated in 20 μl of a reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.8), 1 mM CaCl2, and 36 fmol of the purified enzyme. The fragments of oligopeptides produced by enzymatic reaction were separated by HPLC with a Hitachi 655A-11/LC5000 system using a TSKgel ODS-120T reverse phase column (0.46 × 25 cm). Elution was performed with a gradient from 0% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to 50% acetonitrile in 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid and monitored at 215 and 280 nm. The amino acid composition of each peak was analyzed in an Applied Biosystems 420A derivatizer/analyzer. Preparation and sequencing of peptide fragments were performed according to Iwamatsu(17Iwamatsu A. Electrophoresis. 1992; 13: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme was electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The enzyme on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes was reduced and S-carboxymethylated, then incubated with Acromobacter protease I (lysyl endopeptidase). Released peptide fragments were separated by HPLC using a μ-Bondashpere 5μ C8-300Å column (2.1 × 150 mm, Waters) and submitted to amino acid sequencing with a Shimadzu PSQ-1 gas phase sequencer. Through differential centrifugation, trypsin-like serine protease activities were found both in the microsome fraction and in the vesicle fraction of gastric antral mucosa. Then we used the density gradient centrifugation method to specify the distribution of the trypsin-like activities from both fractions. As shown in Fig. 1, a and b, the trypsin-like protease activity toward Boc-Gln-Gly-Arg-MCA from the microsome fraction was distributed mainly at 1.22-1.23 g/ml, which seemed to be located at the ER fraction as judged from the distribution of glucose-6-phosphatase, an ER marker enzyme (Fig. 1e). The activity of α-mannosidase, a Golgi marker enzyme, was broadly distributed in both microsome and vesicle fractions (Fig. 1f). The distribution pattern of the trypsin-like protease activity was different from that of aminopeptidase and acid phosphatase (Fig. 1, b and d). On the other hand, the trypsin-like protease activity from the vesicle fraction was observed in two broad peaks (fractions 6-7 and 13-15 in Fig. 1c), unlike that of the microsome fraction. Its activity was very low as compared with that of the ER-microsome fraction, and its distribution pattern was also different from those of aminopeptidase and acid phosphatase. The trypsin-like protease activity from the vesicle fraction was clearly separated into two peaks (peak a: d = 1.03 g/ml; peak b: d = 1.11-1.12 g/ml) in the subsequent metrizamide-sucrose density gradient centrifugation at which the osmolarity of each gradient step was adjusted to 300 mosm/kg (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Fractionation of the trypsin-like protease activity from the gastric antral vesicle fraction by metrizamide-sucrose density gradient centrifugation. ●, trypsin-like protease activity toward Boc-Gln-Gly-Arg-MCA; □, protein; ○, density.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) [3H]DFP-labeled pancreatic trypsin was used as the exogenous authentic enzyme to analyze whether the present trypsin-like protease(s) and the exogenous pancreatic trypsin parallel in cellular fractionation of the antral mucosa and density gradient centrifugation of microsome and vesicle fractions. Over 90% of the radioactivity of exogenous [3H]DFP-labeled pancreatic trypsin was found in the cytosol fraction upon cellular fractionation of the antral mucosa (data not shown). When the vesicle or microsome fraction, which still retained a minute quantity of the exogenous [3H]DFP-labeled pancreatic trypsin, was applied to the sucrose or metrizamide-sucrose density gradient centrifugation, the greater part of the radiolabeled enzyme remained at the original density gradient section on which the vesicle or the microsome samples had been loaded, whereas the gastric tryptic activities from the antral mucosa were distributed in other distinct density regions (Fig. 3). The solubilization effects of the activity from the pooled ER-microsome fraction obtained above was examined using various detergents. The effects (percentage of solubilization) decreased in the following order: sodium deoxycholate or Triton X-100 (>95%) > sodium cholate (84%) > Lubrol PX (20%). However, Triton X-100 was somewhat inhibitory to the protease activity, so the trypsin-like protease was solubilized with sodium deoxycholate. Then, the enzyme was purified by a series of chromatographic steps on DEAE-cellulose (DE52), butyl-Toyopearl 650, Sepharose CL-6B, and benzamidine-Sepharose 6B as shown in Fig. 4. The protease activity was separated into two peaks: form A (fractions 38-48) and form B(50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62) in butyl-Toyopearl 650 column chromatography (Fig. 4b). Each active fraction was applied to a Sepharose CL-6B column, which gave a single peak of activity for both form A (Fig. 4c) and form B (data not shown). Each pooled active fraction was completely purified by benzamidine-Sepharose 6B column chromatography (Fig. 4d). Thus, 3.6 μg of form A and 2.4 μg of form B were finally isolated from 77 g of wet antral mucosa from five stomachs (Table I).Table IPurification of the trypsin-like protease from the microsomal fraction of porcine gastric antral mucosaTable IPurification of the trypsin-like protease from the microsomal fraction of porcine gastric antral mucosa When the peaks a and b were solubilized with 0.02% Lubrol PX, the extent of solubilization of the activity peak a was about 50% low as compared with that of the peak b (data not shown). The solubilized fractions of the activity peaks a and b showed some difference on the butyl-Toyopearl chromatography in which all the buffer solutions for equilibration, washing, and elution of the column included 0.1% Lubrol PX (Fig. 5A). The elution profiles of the tryptic activities from peaks a and b were very similar with those of the two forms A and B from the ER-microsome fraction, respectively (Fig. 4b). The trypsin-like protease from peak a was eluted a little earlier (at 21% ammonium sulfate) than that from peak b (at 19%). The two types from peaks a and b were distinctly different from porcine pancreatic trypsin which was eluted at 14% ammonium sulfate, although they showed essentially the same substrate specificity toward MCA substrates with pancreatic trypsin (I). On the other hand, the two forms and the pancreatic trypsin did not show much difference in elution position on butyl-Toyopearl chromatography in which all the buffer solutions for equilibration, washing, and elution of the column were free of Lubrol PX (Fig. 5B), although the two forms a and b were slightly different from that of the pancreatic trypsin. These results indicated that there is some difference in the extent with which Lubrol PX weakens the hydrophobic interactions between the trypsin or trypsin-like proteases and the butyl groups conjugated on the Toyopearl beads. Both forms A and B showed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE the same molecular weight, 22,400 under nonreducing conditions and 28,000 under reducing conditions (Fig. 6). They showed the optimum activity at pH 8-9 (Fig. 7) and were strongly inhibited by DFP, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, leupeptin, and benzamidine (Table II). Form A cleaved only on the C-terminal side of Arg or Lys residues in various oligopeptides (Fig. 8). Both forms A and B cleaved the Arg-MCA bond in various MCA substrates, and the rate of cleavage decreased in the order: Boc-Gln-Gly-Arg-MCA > Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-MCA > Boc-Gln-Arg-Arg-MCA …, which coincided with that of porcine pancreatic trypsin (Table III). Likewise, the two active fractions (peaks a and b) from the metrizamide-sucrose density gradient centrifugation of the vesicle fraction (Fig. 2) showed essentially the same substrate specificity toward these synthetic MCA substrates (Table III).Figure 7:pH dependence of the trypsin-like protease forms A and B.

The HPLC patterns thus obtained were the same for the two forms (data not shown), and five internal fragments from each could be obtained in a pure form and sequenced partially or completely. The N-terminal and five internal sequences determined for both forms were identical with those of porcine pancreatic trypsin (18Hermodson M.A. Ericsson L.H. Neurath H. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3146-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) as shown in Table IV. Furthermore, the N-terminal residue of each of the five internal sequences is presumed to be preceded by a lysine residue in the original protein as judged from the specificity of Acromobacter protease I(19Masaki T. Fujihashi T. Nakamura K. Soejima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 660: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This is also consistent with the sequence of pancreatic trypsin(18Hermodson M.A. Ericsson L.H. Neurath H. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3146-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar).Table IVThe N-terminal and some of the internal amino acid sequences of the trypsin-like protease In this study, trypsin-like serine protease activities were found in the ER-microsome fraction and also in the vesicle fraction of the gastric antral mucosa, and two forms of the trypsin-like protease were purified from the ER-microsome fraction. They were separated from each other by butyl-Toyopearl chromatography, but were indistinguishable in molecular size, substrate specificity, pH dependence of activity, and the effects of inhibitors. Surprisingly, the N-terminal and partial internal sequences, including 59 residues, of both forms were found to be identical with those of porcine pancreatic trypsin (Table IV). Comparison of the partial sequences of the present enzyme with the corresponding sequences of some pancreatic trypsins from other species showed that the identity is 78% with bovine trypsin(20Le Huerou I. Wicker C. Guilloteau P. Tollec R. Puigserver A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), 68% with rat trypsin(21MacDonald R.J. Stary S.J. Swift G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9724-9732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 66% with human trypsin(22Tani T. Kawashima I. Mita K. Takiguchi Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these differences roughly corresponded to those for the entire amino acid sequences among these trypsins; the identity of porcine trypsin is 79% with bovine trypsin, 79% with rat trypsin, and 78% with human trypsin. On the other hand, the identities with other typical serine proteases were 36% with bovine chymotrypsin(23Hartley B.S.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Considering these results, especially the fact that the present enzyme showed differences of over 20% in amino acid sequence identity even with the bovine, rat, and human pancreatic trypsins, the identity of the partial sequence, including 59 residues, of the present enzyme with that of porcine pancreatic trypsin (223 residues) seems to permit us to conclude, beyond statistical consideration, that trypsin (or trypsin variant, an enzyme almost identical with trypsin) has been found in the stomach mucosa. The trypsin activities from the ER-microsome fraction and that from the vesicle fraction were found at different densities in sucrose density gradient centrifugation. However, the two peaks of trypsin-like activity from the vesicle fraction were also indistinguishable from each other and from the enzyme of the microsome fraction in substrate specificity (Table III) and pH dependence of activity and the effects of inhibitors (data not shown). Two types of trypsin-like proteases (peaks a and b in Fig. 2) from the vesicle fraction were differently eluted from butyl-Toyopearl 650 in which proteins are separated mainly by differences in hydrophobic binding forces (Fig. 5A) and its elution profile seemed to be consistent with each of the two forms A and B from the ER-microsome (Fig. 4b). This indicates the possibility that the same gastric trypsin may be separately associated with different organelle membranes. It may be possible that some of the trypsin in the ER could move, through Golgi, to the vesicle fraction. Thus, the two activity peaks of the vesicle fraction may correspond to the two enzyme forms of the ER-microsomes. It seems interesting to elucidate how the enzymes can associate with the ER-microsome or vesicle. Compared with pancreatic trypsin, they may have some minor variation in the amino acid sequence that increase the affinity to the membranes. Trypsin is normally synthesized in the β-cells of the pancreas as trypsinogen, which is then secreted into duodenum and activated by enteropeptidase and/or trypsin, and functions as a digestive protease in duodenum and intestine(34Keil B. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Vol. 3. Academic Press, New York1971: 249-275Google Scholar, 35Walsh K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 19: 41-63Crossref Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possibility of contamination of pancreatic trypsin due to duodenogastric reflux may be considered. To investigate this possibility, an exogenous authentic enzyme, [3H]DFP-labeled pancreatic trypsin, was added to antral mucosa, then homogenization, cellular fractionation, and density gradient fractionation were done. Metrizamide-sucrose or sucrose density gradient fractionation of the vesicle or microsome fractions which still included a minute quantity of exogenous [3H]DFP-labeled pancreatic trypsin showed that the exogenous trypsin was retained at the original density gradient region where the sample had been applied, but that the gastric tryptic activities from the vesicle or ER-microsome source were distributed at other distinct density regions (Fig. 3). These results exclude the possibility of contamination of pancreatic trypsin from duodenum. Davis et al.(36Davis B.P. Hammer R.E. Messing A. MacDonald R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26070-26077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the trypsin mRNA was found in the stomach mucosa of both normal and transgenic mice. They showed that the expression of pancreatic genes, including the trypsin genes, is controlled differently in stomach and in pancreas and excluded the possibility of pancreatic contamination. On the other hand, a trypsin-like protease complexed with α2-macroglobulin was found in porcine gastric mucosa in our previous study(4Uchino T. Sakurai Y. Nishigai M. Takahashi T. Arakawa H. Ikai A. Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 527-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the possibility that trypsin may function in other normal tissues besides in duodenal and intestinal tracts has been suggested by Wiegand et al.(37Wiegand U. Corbach S. Minn A. Kang J. Müller-Hill B. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 136: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). They reported the cloning of the cDNA encoding two forms of human brain trypsinogen which show 99.2% homology with that of human pancreatic trypsinogen III (22Tani T. Kawashima I. Mita K. Takiguchi Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in the sequences of exon 2-5 regions. Furthermore, some papers have reported that pancreatic trypsin inhibitor was found in normal gastric mucosa (7-9). Protease inhibitors such as α2-macroglobulin and pancreatic trypsin inhibitor in gastric mucosa might also be involved in regulation of the trypsin-like activity, whereas they might also play a role, if secreted, in gastric mucosal defense by inhibiting duodenal proteases upon duodenogastric reflux. However, the occurrence of the gastric trypsin in the ER-microsome fraction and the presence of trypsin mRNA in the glandular portion of the stomach (36Davis B.P. Hammer R.E. Messing A. MacDonald R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26070-26077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) support our idea that gastric trypsin (or trypsin variant) may be produced in the gastric mucosal cell and function as an intracellular protease in the gastric mucosal tissue. It may function as a specific degrading or processing enzyme in the ER or vesicles of gastric mucosal cells. The gastric trypsin is thought to be synthesized as trypsinogen like pancreatic trypsin, but its conversion to trypsin seems to occur intracellularly unlike pancreatic trypsin. It will be interesting to investigate whether the gastric trypsinogen is activated by the action of an enteropeptidase or an enteropeptidase-like enzyme which might be present intracellularly in gastric mucosa or by another intracellular protease. Further enzymatic and molecular characterization, including the investigation of the structural relationship among the isoforms, and elucidation of the roles of the gastric trypsin and the activation mechanism of its proform, remain to be done in future studies.
