Lee et al. describe a 3D printing technique to build complex collagen scaffolds for engineering biological tissues (see the Perspective by Dasgupta and Black). Collagen gelation was controlled by modulation of pH and could provide up to 10-micrometer resolution on printing. Cells could be embedded in the collagen or pores could be introduced into the scaffold via embedding of gelatin spheres. The authors demonstrated successful 3D printing of five components of the human heart spanning capillary to full-organ scale, which they validated for tissue and organ function.

Yang et al. show that in situ reaction of perovskites with sulfate or phosphate ions can create thin, strongly bonded lead oxysalt layers that protect defect sites. This layer also boosts charge carrier lifetimes that lead to a power conversion efficiency of more than 20%. Encapsulated devices maintained about 97% of this efficiency with simulated solar irradiation for nearly 2 months at a realistic operation temperature of 65°C. Science , this issue p. 473"

If a battery is implanted with the device, replacing it would require additional surgery. On the other hand, external power packs are prone to lead to infections where their wires enter the body. Hinchet et al. describe a triboelectric generator that can convert externally applied ultrasound into an internal electricity source capable of delivering sufficient energy to recharge a battery on a daily basis.

However, the utility of existing GEVIs has been limited by the brightness and photostability of fluorescent proteins and rhodopsins. We engineered a GEVI, called Voltron, that uses bright and photostable synthetic dyes instead of protein-based fluorophores, thereby extending the number of neurons imaged simultaneously in vivo by a factor of 10 and enabling imaging for significantly longer durations relative to existing GEVIs. We used Voltron for in vivo voltage imaging in mice, zebrafish, and fruit flies. In the mouse cortex, Voltron allowed single-trial recording of spikes and subthreshold voltage signals from dozens of neurons simultaneously over a 15-minute period of continuous imaging. In larval zebrafish, Voltron enabled the precise correlation of spike timing with behavior."

However, the commensal and pathogenic repertoire of resident microbes encountered in the wild is not replicated in a lab setting. This can substantially distort how the immune system develops and functions, leading to false assumptions of how our own “wild” immune system works. Rosshart et al. circumvented this dilemma by implanting lab-strain embryos into wild mice (see the Perspective by Nobs and Elinav). The resultant “wildlings” had a systemic immune phenotype and a bacterial, viral, and fungal microbiome much closer to those of their wild counterparts. In two preclinical experiments, where lab mice had previously failed to predict the human response to drug treatments, wildlings accurately phenocopied patient outcomes.

While a few topological phases appear in condensed matter systems, a current challenge is the implementation and study of such quantum many-body ground states in artificial matter. Here, we report the experimental realization of a symmetry protected topological phase of interacting bosons in a one-dimensional lattice, and demonstrate a robust ground state degeneracy attributed to protected edge states. The setup is based on atoms trapped in an array of optical tweezers and excited into Rydberg levels, which gives rise to hard-core bosons with an effective hopping by dipolar exchange interaction."

Yet the cellular mechanisms that induce B cells to produce IgE in response to allergens remain poorly understood. T follicular helper (TFH) cells direct the affinity and isotype of antibodies produced by B cells. Although TFH cell-derived interleukin-4 (IL-4) is necessary for IgE production, it is not sufficient. We report a rare population of IL-13-producing TFH cells present in mice and humans with IgE to allergens, but not when allergen-specific IgE was absent or only low-affinity. These ""TFH13"" cells have an unusual cytokine profile (IL-13hiIL-4hiIL-5hiIL-21lo) and coexpress the transcription factors BCL6 and GATA3. TFH13 cells are required for production of high- but not low-affinity IgE and subsequent allergen-induced anaphylaxis. Blocking TFH13 cells may represent an alternative therapeutic target to ameliorate anaphylaxis."

Dumortier et al. describe how a blastocoel lumen arises from the hydraulic fracturing of cell-cell contacts into hundreds of micrometer-size water pockets that then form a single large lumen (see the Perspective by Arroyo and Trepat). The authors characterized the process of lumen formation mechanically and molecularly and were able to manipulate the first axis of symmetry of the mammalian embryo experimentally.

Within a handful of generations, marked phenotypic change can occur—often to smaller body sizes, because it is the big fish that are usually extracted. Therkildsen et al. examined wild ancestor fish lineages and found that polygenic mechanisms underpin this rapid evolutionary capacity (see the Perspective by Jørgensen and Enberg). Phenotypic change happened in two ways: first, by multiple small parallel changes in hundreds of unlinked genes associated with growth variation in the wild, and second, by shifts in large blocks of linked genes, causing large allele frequency changes at some loci.

https://openalex.org/W2965528058,"In many cancers, high proliferation rates correlate with elevation of rRNA and tRNA levels, and nucleolar hypertrophy. However, the underlying mechanisms linking increased nucleolar transcription and tumorigenesis are only minimally understood. Here we show that IMP dehydrogenase-2 (IMPDH2), the rate-limiting enzyme for de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis, is overexpressed in the highly lethal brain cancer glioblastoma. This leads to increased rRNA and tRNA synthesis, stabilization of the nucleolar GTP-binding protein nucleostemin, and enlarged, malformed nucleoli. Pharmacological or genetic inactivation of IMPDH2 in glioblastoma reverses these effects and inhibits cell proliferation, whereas untransformed glia cells are unaffected by similar IMPDH2 perturbations. Impairment of IMPDH2 activity triggers nucleolar stress and growth arrest of glioblastoma cells even in the absence of functional p53. Our results reveal that upregulation of IMPDH2 is a prerequisite for the occurance of aberrant nucleolar function and increased anabolic processes in glioblastoma, which constitutes a primary event in gliomagenesis."

The oxygen isotope composition of marine carbonates has changed markedly over the past 3.5 billion years. However, it has been difficult to determine whether that is because of a cooling of the seawater (from temperatures as high as 70°C) or an actual change in the isotope composition of the water. Galili et al. calibrated the temperature-dependent oxygen isotope fractionation between iron oxides and aqueous solutions and constructed an oxygen isotope record in marine iron oxides covering the past 2 billion years. Their findings suggest that a change in the isotope composition of the water, rather than its cooling, underlies the observed geological trend. Science , this issue p. 469"
https://openalex.org/W2965981496,"In hypertrophic scar (HS) formation, the type 2 immune response induces the alternatively activated macrophages (M2), which manipulate fibroblasts to differentiate into myofibroblasts with active biologic functions and proliferation. Myofibroblasts express α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and synthesize and produce additional collagen type I and collagen type III, inducing HS formation. However, studies on the mechanism of M2 macrophage modulation are only based on the recognition of profibrotic factors such as TGF-β1 secreted by macrophages. The influence of exosomes from M2 macrophages on scar formation is still unknown. Both M2 macrophages and myofibroblasts highly express glutaminases (GLSs). GLS is a critical enzyme in glutaminolysis and is important for M2 macrophage and fibroblast polarization. In this study, we found that in a TGF-β1-stimulated coculture system, a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) named lncRNA-ASLNCS5088 was enriched in M2 macrophage-derived exosomes. This lncRNA could be transferred with high efficiency to fibroblasts and acted as an endogenous sponge to adsorb microRNA-200c-3p, resulting in increased GLS and α-SMA expression. Pretreatment with GW4869, which impairs M2 macrophage exosome synthesis, ameliorated these pathologic changes in fibroblasts in vitro. Local injection in the late scar formation period with GW4869 reduced α-SMA+ fibroblasts and alleviated the fibrosis of tissue after wound healing in vivo.-Chen, J., Zhou, R., Liang, Y., Fu, X., Wang, D., Wang, C.

https://openalex.org/W2966105833,"Background Many low and middle-income countries are increasingly cognisant of the need to offer financial protection to its citizens through pre-payment schemes in order to curb high out of pocket expenditure and catastrophic spending on healthcare. However, there is limited rigorous contextual evidence to make decisions regarding optimal design of such schemes. This study assesses the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the recently introduced state contributory health insurance scheme (SHIS) in Nigeria. Methods The study took place in 6 local government areas in Kaduna state, North-west Nigeria. Data were collected from a household survey using a three-stage cluster sampling approach, with each household having the same probability of being selected. Interviews were conducted with 4000 individuals in 1020 households. Contingent valuation was used to elicit the willing to pay (WTP) for the household using the bidding game technique. The relationship between socioeconomic status and WTP was also examined using logistic regression models. Findings About 82% of the household heads were willing to pay insurance premiums for their households, which came to an average of 513 Naira (1.68 USD) per month per person. The average amount individuals were willing to pay was lower in rural areas (611 Naira) compared to urban areas (463 Naira). These results were influenced by household size, level of education, occupation and household income. In addition, only 65% of the households had the ability to pay the average premium. Conclusion Socioeconomic factors influence individuals’ WTP for contributory health insurance schemes. It is important to create awareness about the benefits of the insurance scheme, especially in rural areas, and in both the formal and informal sectors in Nigeria. WTP information can inform the amount of insurance premiums. However, it is important to consider differences between the WTP and the cost of benefits package to be offered, as the premium amount may need to be subsidized with public financing."
https://openalex.org/W2966795134,"Measurements of Young’s moduli are mostly evaluated using strong assumptions, such as sample homogeneity and isotropy. At the same time, descriptions of measurement parameters often lack detailed specifications. Many of these assumptions are, for soft hydrogels especially, not completely valid and the complexity of hydrogel microindentation demands more sophisticated experimental procedures in order to describe their elastic properties more accurately. We created an algorithm that automates indentation data analysis as a basis for the evaluation of large data sets with consideration of the influence of indentation depth on the measured Young’s modulus. The algorithm automatically determines the Young’s modulus in indentation regions where it becomes independent of the indentation depth and furthermore minimizes the error from fitting an elastic model to the data. This approach is independent of the chosen elastic fitting model and indentation device. With this, we are able to evaluate large amounts of indentation curves recorded on many different sample positions and can therefore apply statistical methods to overcome deviations due to sample inhomogeneities. To prove the applicability of our algorithm, we carried out a systematic analysis of how the indentation speed, indenter size and sample thickness affect the determination of Young’s modulus from atomic force microscope (AFM) indentation curves on polyacrylamide (PAAm) samples. We chose the Hertz model as the elastic fitting model for this proof of principle of our algorithm and found that all of these parameters influence the measured Young’s moduli to a certain extent. Hence, it is essential to clearly state the experimental parameters used in microindentation experiments to ensure reproducibility and comparability of data."

But its role in tissue fibrosis remains unclear. Here we demonstrated that injury to the kidney increased DOT1L expression and H3K79 dimethylation in renal tubular epithelial cells and myofibroblasts in a murine model of unilateral ureteral obstruction. Administration of EPZ5676, a highly selective inhibitor of DOT1L, attenuated renal fibrosis. Treatment with EPZ5676 or DOT1L small interfering RNA also inhibited TGF-β1 and serum-induced activation of renal interstitial fibroblasts and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro. Moreover, blocking DOT1L abrogated injury-induced epithelial G2/M arrest; reduced expression of Snail, Twist, and Notch1; and inactivated several profibrotic signaling molecules in the injured kidney, including Smad3, epidermal growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, protein kinase B, and NF-κB. Conversely, DOT1L inhibition increased expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog, a protein associated with dephosphorylation of tyrosine kinase receptors, and prevented decline in levels of Klotho and Smad7, 2 renoprotective factors. Thus, our data indicate that targeting DOT1L attenuates renal fibrosis through inhibition of renal fibroblasts and EMT by suppressing activation of multiple profibrotic signaling pathways while retaining expression of renoprotective factors.-Liu, L., Zou, J., Guan, Y., Zhang, Y., Zhang, W., Zhou, X., Xiong, C., Tolbert, E., Zhao, T.

https://openalex.org/W2966194426,"Because bladder cancer (BC) is one of the most common malignant cancers of the urinary system, identification of BC cell growth-associated effectors is of great significance. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)6 is a member of the CDK family of cell cycle-related proteins and plays an important role in cancer cell growth. This is borne out by the fact that a CDK6 inhibitor had been approved to treat several types of cancers. Nevertheless, underlying molecular mechanisms concerning how to regulate CDK6 expression in BC remains unclear. In the present study, it was observed that miR-934 was much higher in human BCs and human BC cell lines as well. The results also revealed that miR-934 inhibition dramatically decreased human BC cell monolayer growth in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in vivo; the outcomes were accompanied by CDK6 protein down-regulation and G0-G1 cell cycle arrest. Moreover, overexpression of CDK6 reversed the inhibition of BC cell growth induced by miR-934. Further studies showed that miR-934 binds to a 3'-UTR of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2N (ube2n) mRNA, down-regulated UBE2N protein expression; this, in turn, attenuated CDK6 protein degradation and led to CDK6 protein accumulation as well as the promotion of BC tumor growth. Collectively, this study not only establishes a novel regulatory axis of miR-934/UBE2N of CDK6 but also provides data suggesting that miR-934 and UBE2N may be potentially promising targets for therapeutic strategies against BC.-Yan, H., Ren, S., Lin, Q., Yu, Y., Chen, C., Hua, X., Jin, H., Lu, Y., Zhang, H., Xie, Q., Huang, C., Huang, H.

Previously, we reported that G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) positively regulates mitochondrial ATP production by interacting with FOF1-ATP synthase. G0S2 overexpression mitigates ATP decline in cardiomyocytes and strongly increases their hypoxic tolerance during ischemia. Here, we show that G0S2 protein undergoes proteasomal degradation via a cytosolic molecular triage system and that inhibiting this process increases mitochondrial ATP production in hypoxia. First, we performed screening with a library of siRNAs targeting ubiquitin-related genes and identified RING finger protein 126 (RNF126) as an E3 ligase involved in G0S2 degradation. RNF126-deficient cells exhibited prolonged G0S2 protein turnover and reduced G0S2 ubiquitination. BCL2-associated athanogene 6 (BAG6), involved in the molecular triage of nascent membrane proteins, enhanced RNF126-mediated G0S2 ubiquitination both in vitro and in vivo. Next, we found that Glu-44 in the hydrophobic region of G0S2 acts as a degron necessary for G0S2 polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Because this degron was required for an interaction of G0S2 with BAG6, an alanine-replaced G0S2 mutant (E44A) escaped degradation. In primary cultured cardiomyocytes, both overexpression of the G0S2 E44A mutant and RNF126 knockdown effectively attenuated ATP decline under hypoxic conditions.

A potential strategy for increasing protein expression is to target the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) to inhibit protein degradation. UPS is the principal mechanism for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. Ubiquitination, a type of protein posttranslational modification, entails the covalent conjugation of the small ubiquitin protein through the formation of an isopeptide bond between a glycine residue of ubiquitin and lysine residue of the substrate. This reaction occurs through a sequential enzymatic mechanism involving E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase). E3 is a key enzyme that mediates substrate recognition and is thus responsible for the selectivity and specificity of this system (7Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev.

We further demonstrated that the inhibition of G0S2 degradation by RNF126 knockdown or by overexpression of a G0S2 degradation-resistant mutant that sequestered BAG6 preserved mitochondrial ATP concentrations in cardiomyocytes under hypoxic conditions. This result indicates that inhibiting G0S2 degradation may be a novel therapeutic strategy for ATP-depleting conditions such as ischemic heart diseases, mitochondrial diseases, and metabolic diseases. We first examined G0S2 protein stability in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Cells were treated with cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis, and the amount of G0S2 protein was analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1A). G0S2 was rapidly degraded with a half-life of ∼20 min. Proteasome inhibitors, but not lysosomal inhibitors, increased G0S2 protein amounts, indicating degradation by UPS in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1B). Although G0S2 was reported to be regulated by UPS (9Heckmann B.L. Zhang X. Saarinen A.M. Liu J. Regulation of G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) protein ubiquitination and stability by triglyceride accumulation and ATGL interaction.PLoS One. 2016; 11 (27248498): e015674210.1371/journal.pone.0156742Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the E3 ligases involved had yet to be identified. Therefore, to identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase specific for G0S2, we performed functional screening using an siRNA library targeting ubiquitin-related genes encoding E1, E2, and E3. We first established C2C12 myoblast cell lines stably expressing EGFP-fused G0S2 to monitor G0S2 protein degradation (C2C12/EGFP-G0S2 cells). Treatment of these cell lines with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 induced G0S2 protein accumulation, which manifested as increased EGFP intensity (Fig. S1A). As a positive control for the screening, we selected siRNA for UBA1, an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, and confirmed a 2-fold increase in the fluorescence of EGFP-G0S2 after UBA1 knockdown (Fig. S1B). To quantitatively measure the fluorescence intensity of each C2C12/EGFP-G0S2 cell in a high-throughput manner, we used an automated high-content imaging system. In the primary screening, siRNAs from the library were transfected into C2C12/EGFP-G0S2 cells in 96-well plates. After 72-h incubation, cells were imaged and their fluorescence intensities were analyzed (Fig. 1C; Table S1). As positive hits, we selected the genes that demonstrated a log2 -fold change in fluorescence that was greater than 0.6 (Fig. 1D). As a counter assay, we established cell lines expressing the EGFP-fused CL1 degron (ACKNWFSSLSHFVIHL) (C2C12/EGFP-CL1 cells), which has been shown to be rapidly degraded by proteasome (10Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system by protein aggregation.Science. 2001; 292 (11375494): 1552-155510.1126/science.292.5521.1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C; Fig. S1, C and D; Table S1). The counter assay, together with an assessment of cell number in primary screening (Table S1), identified one gene, RNF126, as a candidate for the G0S2-specific E3 ligase (Fig. 1E). Because the screening used pools that included four individual siRNAs at once, individual siRNA for RNF126 was separately transfected to C2C12 stably expressing HA-tagged G0S2 cells, and G0S2 protein levels were examined. We confirmed ∼60% knockdown of RNF126 by each siRNA (Fig. 1F), and G0S2 protein levels were markedly increased by every siRNA (Fig. 1G). To examine whether RNF126 acts as an E3 ligase for G0S2 in cells, we used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to generate two RNF126 KO cell lines, specifically RNF126-deficient (RNF126 KO) and RNF126-deficient EGFP-G0S2–expressing (RNF126 KO/EGFP-G0S2) cells (Fig. S2). Endogenous G0S2 protein expression was elevated in RNF126 KO cells (Fig. 2A), and RNF126 KO/EGFP-G0S2 cells exhibited an increased EGFP-G0S2 protein half-life as shown by cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 2, B and C). Next, to examine whether the G0S2 protein accumulation was because of RNF126 deficiency, human RNF126 (hRNF126) was dose-dependently expressed in RNF126 KO cells (Fig. 2D). In hRNF126-expressing cells, accumulation of G0S2 protein was decreased. We further tested the in vivo ubiquitination of G0S2 in both RNF126 KO cells and control cells. After the transfection of HA-G0S2, cell lysates were subjected to a TUBE2-Agarose pulldown assay, followed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2E). A ladder of polyubiquitinated G0S2 was clearly observed in control cells. On the other hand, in RNF126 KO cells, the polyubiquitinated form of G0S2 was decreased (Fig. 2E). Re-expression of hRNF126 in RNF126 KO cells restored G0S2 ubiquitination. These data suggest that RNF126 acts as an E3 ligase for G0S2 and specifically regulates its degradation in vivo. To investigate the physiological role of RNF126 as a G0S2 E3 ligase, we used primary cultured cardiomyocytes. The knockdown of RNF126 using siRNA in cardiomyocytes confirmed G0S2 protein accumulation without affecting its mRNA expression (Fig. 3, A and B). In a previous report, we used a mitochondria-targeted FRET-based ATP biosensor, Mit-ATeam, to show that overexpression of G0S2 enhanced mitochondrial ATP production in neonatal cardiomyocytes under hypoxic conditions (5Kioka H.

In the present study, we used this probe to examine whether RNF126 affected mitochondrial ATP production in cardiomyocytes under hypoxic conditions. Because G0S2 expression is induced by hypoxic stimuli, we examined whether hypoxic stimuli change G0S2 turnover. Even under hypoxic condition, G0S2 was also degraded at the same rate of that in normoxic condition (Fig. S3A) and its degradation was inhibited by proteasome inhibitor (Fig. S3B). Moreover, hypoxic stimuli did not change the protein expression of RNF126 (Fig. S3C). We transfected RNF126 siRNA or control siRNA into cardiomyocytes and then infected cells with Mit-ATeam-encoding adenovirus. Forty-eight h after adenovirus infection, mitochondrial ATP concentrations were measured by a Mit-ATeam assay during hypoxia. The mitochondrial ATP concentration ([ATP]mito) gradually declined in cardiomyocytes transfected with either control or RNF126 siRNA. Notably, the knockdown of RNF126 before the onset of hypoxia reduced this decline in [ATP]mito (Fig. 3, C and D). These data indicated that increased G0S2 protein levels caused by RNF126 knockdown enhanced mitochondrial ATP production. RNF126 is a RING finger–type E3 ubiquitin ligase and several substrates of RNF126 have been reported (12Ishida N. Nakagawa T. Iemura S.I. Yasui A. Shima H. Katoh Y. Nagasawa Y. Natsume T. Igarashi K.

In addition, RNF126 was recently reported to be an E3 ligase that degrades mislocalized or tail-anchored transmembrane proteins together with the BAG6-UBL4A-TRC35 complex (16Rodrigo-Brenni M.C. Gutierrez E. Hegde R.S. Cytosolic quality control of mislocalized proteins requires RNF126 recruitment to Bag6.Mol. Cell. 2014; 55 (24981174): 227-23710.1016/j.molcel.2014.05.025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the involvement of the BAG6 complex in RNF126-mediated G0S2 degradation. First, we knocked down BAG6 by specific siRNA in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and C2C12 cells expressing HA-G0S2, then analyzed G0S2 protein amounts. BAG6 knockdown increased G0S2 protein expression in both cardiomyocytes and C2C12 cells (Fig. 4, A and B) and also inhibited G0S2 ubiquitination (Fig. 4C). Cycloheximide chase analysis showed that the half-life of G0S2 was significantly longer than that of control cells in BAG6 knocked-down cells (Fig. 4, D and E). These data suggest that BAG6 is also essential for G0S2 ubiquitination and degradation as a partner protein of RNF126. Furthermore, we examined whether BAG6 knockdown influences mitochondrial ATP decline under hypoxic condition in cardiomyocytes using Mit-ATeam assay. Hypoxia did not affect BAG6 protein expression (Fig. S3C). Intriguingly, despite the accumulation of G0S2 protein (Fig. 4A), BAG6 knockdown did not affect the mitochondrial ATP production under hypoxia (Fig. 4, F and G), suggesting that BAG6 acts as not only a part of E3 ligase complex but also a molecular switch of newly synthesized protein (see “Discussion”). To further reveal the mechanism of G0S2 degradation, it is important to identify the degron in G0S2 that is involved in substrate recognition by the E3 ligase (17Ravid T. Hochstrasser M. Diversity of degradation signals in the ubiquitin-proteasome system.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9 (18698327): 679-69010.1038/nrm2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 18Guharoy M. Bhowmick P. Sallam M. Tompa P. Tripartite degrons confer diversity and specificity on regulated protein degradation in the ubiquitin-proteasome system.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (26732515): 1023910.1038/ncomms10239Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We created several deletion mutants in the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of G0S2, as well as alanine-scanning mutants in the hydrophobic region (Fig. 5A). These G0S2 mutants were transfected into C2C12 cells. After treatment with MG132, cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 5B). Among these mutants, only the Glu-44 to Ala (E44A) mutant was unaffected by MG132, showing a vast increase in basal protein expression. This suggests that amino acid Glu-44 of G0S2 plays an important role in G0S2 degradation. Then, we assessed the in vivo ubiquitination and protein half-life of G0S2 E44A. G0S2 E44A was less ubiquitinated (Fig. 5C) and had a longer half-life (Fig. 5, D and E) than the WT. These data suggested that the domain around Glu-44 is a degron of G0S2 that is recognized by the RNF126/BAG6 complex. Thus, we tested the interaction of G0S2 with BAG6 in cells expressing WT or E44A mutant of G0S2. A co-immunoprecipitation experiment revealed that BAG6 preferentially interacted with G0S2 WT rather than with E44A (Fig. 5F). These data suggested that BAG6 interacted with G0S2 and recruited RNF126 for ubiquitination. Because BAG6 not only acts as a scaffold protein of RNF126 but also has a shield-like function to protect the hydrophobic domain of the substrate (19Hessa T. Sharma A. Mariappan M. Eshleman H.D. Gutierrez E. Hegde R.S. Protein targeting and degradation are coupled for elimination of mislocalized proteins.Nature. 2011; 475 (21743475): 394-39710.1038/nature10181Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), we considered that BAG6 knockdown or the expression of G0S2 E44A might have caused G0S2 protein aggregation. Thus, to examine the effect of BAG6 knockdown on protein aggregation, C2C12 cells expressing HA-G0S2 WT or E44A were transfected with siRNA for BAG6 and then solubilized with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. In BAG6-depleted cells, protein aggregates were detected in the detergent-insoluble fraction (20Wang Q. Liu Y. Soetandyo N. Baek K. Hegde R. Ye Y. A ubiquitin ligase-associated chaperone holdase maintains polypeptides in soluble states for proteasome degradation.Mol.

These data suggest that the G0S2 E44A escaped BAG6-mediated degradation without causing its protein aggregation. Next we tested whether the RNF126/BAG6 complex was sufficient to ubiquitinate G0S2 by constructing an in vitro ubiquitination assay. We prepared recombinant GST-RNF126 using Escherichia coli and recombinant G0S2 and BAG6 from HEK293T cells (Fig. S4, A–C). UBCH5B was chosen as the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme for RNF126 because only the knockdown of UBCH5B increased G0S2 protein expression during our siRNA library screening. Moreover, UBCH5B was reported to act as an E2 enzyme with RNF126 (13Benini M. Fortuni S. Condò I. Alfedi G. Malisan F. Toschi N. Serio D. Massaro D.S. Arcuri G. Testi R. Rufini A.

In an in vitro ubiquitination assay, recombinant G0S2 was slightly ubiquitinated by GST-RNF126 only in the presence of E1, E2, ATP, and ubiquitin (Fig. 6A, lane 4). In contrast, the addition of recombinant BAG6 strongly enhanced G0S2 ubiquitination by RNF126 (Fig. 6A, lane 5; Fig. S4D). A catalytically inactive mutant of RNF126 (C231A/C234A, CA) (22Smith C.J. Berry D.M. McGlade C.J. The E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF126 and Rabring7 regulate endosomal sorting of the epidermal growth factor receptor.J.

The G0S2 E44A mutant that inhibited BAG6 interaction was less ubiquitinated than the WT, as well as the G0S2 lysine-less mutant (Fig. 6B, lanes 4 and 5; Fig. S4E). We also examined whether G0S2 was ubiquitinated at the type of Lys-48 or Lys-63 linkage by combining an in vitro ubiquitination assay and subsequent immunoprecipitation. Immunoblotting with Lys-48 linkage–specific antibody revealed that RNF126 ubiquitinated G0S2 at Lys-48–linked ubiquitination, in consistent with previous reports (Fig. S4F) (12Ishida N. Nakagawa T.

These data indicate that the BAG6 complex is sufficient for G0S2 recognition and ubiquitination. To confirm the importance of BAG6-G0S2 interaction in G0S2 degradation, G0S2 E44A- or WT-encoding lentivirus was expressed in cardiomyocytes. Treatment with proteasome inhibitors results in accumulation of the G0S2 WT protein but not the E44A mutant (Fig. 7A). Cycloheximide chase analysis also revealed that compared with WT, the G0S2 E44A mutant had a greatly increased half-life and higher basal protein expression (Fig. 7, B and C). We next examined the changes in [ATP]mito during hypoxia with the Mit-ATeam assay. Whereas overexpression of G0S2 WT enhanced [ATP]mito, as reported previously, G0S2 E44A also enhanced [ATP]mito to a greater extent than WT (Fig. 7, D and E). We further tested whether this augment of mitochondrial ATP production led to restore the cellular viability in hypoxic stress. The prehypoxia overexpression of G0S2 E44A in cardiomyocytes ameliorated hypoxia-induced cell death (Fig. 7F). These results suggest that inhibiting G0S2 degradation via BAG6 sequestration enhances mitochondrial ATP concentration under hypoxic condition and maintains cellular viability. Our recent study showed that G0S2 played an important role in mitochondrial ATP production under hypoxic conditions (5Kioka H. Kato H. Fujikawa M. Tsukamoto O. Suzuki T. Imamura H. Nakano A. Higo S.

Overexpression of G0S2 in cardiomyocytes attenuated the decline in mitochondrial ATP levels during hypoxia and protected cells from hypoxic damage. These results indicate that increasing in G0S2 expression may be a novel therapeutic target for ischemic disease. Thus, for the purpose of developing innovative drugs to increase G0S2 expression, in this study we focused on G0S2 protein turnover. We demonstrated rapid G0S2 protein degradation in cardiomyocytes and identified RNF126 as an E3 ligase for G0S2 by functional screening using an siRNA library. RNF126 has been implicated in a number of physiological processes, such as mitochondrial metabolic flux (23Yoshino S. Hara T. Nakaoka H.J. Kanamori A. Murakami Y. Seiki M. Sakamoto T. The ERK signaling target RNF126 regulates anoikis resistance in cancer cells by changing the mitochondrial metabolic flux.Cell Discov. 2016; 2 (27462466): 1601910.1038/celldisc.2016.19Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and membrane receptor trafficking (22Smith C.J.

It was shown previously that global Lin28A overexpression during mouse embryogenesis results in perinatal lethality. However, the reason for this early lethality has not been elucidated. Here, we showed that Lin28A overexpression prevents normal lung development via the inhibition of the Let-7 micro RNAs, thus causing the perinatal lethality. We further found that Lin28A overexpression in lung mesenchymal cells, but not epithelial cells, is sufficient to recapitulate the lung phenotype. Moreover, we defined the specific time window wherein Lin28A expression exerts its effect. Deep characterization of the transgenic lungs suggests that the Lin28A-Let-7 pathway delays the transition from one developmental stage to another but does not completely abrogate the differentiation capacity of the lung progenitor cells. Finally, we suggested that the effect of Lin28A-Let-7 on embryonic lung development is mediated at least in part through the TGF-β1-signaling pathway. Altogether, these findings define for the first time the Lin28-Let-7 pathway as a critical heterochronic regulator of lung development.-Komarovsky Gulman, N., Armon, L., Shalit, T., Urbach, A.

Steps/day thresholds ranged from 4325-6192 steps/day. Higher thresholds were observed in men compared to women. In men, higher steps/day thresholds were observed in age ranges of 30-39, while in women, higher thresholds were observed in the age-range 50-59 years. Decision trees for classifying being at low risk for metabolic syndrome contained one risk-free leaf at higher cadence bands, specifically for any time accumulated at ≥120 steps/min.Minimum thresholds representing absence of cardiometabolic risk range from 4325-6192 steps/day and 66-72 steps/min for peak 30-min cadence. Any time accumulated at ≥120 steps/min was associated with an absence of cardiometabolic risk. Although based on cross-sectional data, these thresholds represent potentially important and clinically interpretable daily physical activity goals."

In particular, phosphorylation and SUMOylation can distinctly regulate the activity of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) transactivator immediate early 2 (IE2). However, the molecular mechanism of this process is unknown. Using various structural, biochemical, and cell-based approaches, here we uncovered that IE2 exploits a cross-talk between phosphorylation and SUMOylation. A scan for small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-interacting motifs (SIMs) revealed two SIMs in IE2, and a real-time SUMOylation assay indicated that the N-terminal SIM (IE2–SIM1) enhances IE2 SUMOylation up to 4-fold. Kinetic analysis and structural studies disclosed that IE2 is a SUMO cis-E3 ligase. We also found that two putative casein kinase 2 (CK2) sites adjacent to IE2–SIM1 are phosphorylated in vitro and in cells. The phosphorylation drastically increased IE2–SUMO affinity, IE2 SUMOylation, and cis-E3 activity of IE2. Additional salt bridges between the phosphoserines and SUMO accounted for the increased IE2–SUMO affinity. Phosphorylation also enhanced the SUMO-dependent transactivation activity and auto-repression activity of IE2. Together, our findings highlight a novel mechanism whereby SUMOylation and phosphorylation of the viral cis-E3 ligase and transactivator protein IE2 work in tandem to enable transcriptional regulation of viral gene.

https://openalex.org/W2965990201,"Background Shigellosis is the second leading cause of diarrheal death globally. The global burden has been complicated by the emergence of Shigella strains resistant to first line antibiotic treatments such as ciprofloxacin. This study aims to describe the epidemiologic distribution of the most common Shigella species, and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid (NA) in Latin America. Methods Laboratory data from 19 countries were obtained through the Latin American Network for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (ReLAVRA) from 2000–2015. The Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute reduced susceptibility breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae was used to interpret the disc diffusion tests for Shigella susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and NA. Negative binominal regression was used to analyze longitudinal trends of Shigella isolates antimicrobial susceptibility. Results 79,548 Shigella isolates were tested and reported between 2000–2015. The most common isolated species were S. flexneri (49%), and S. sonnei (28%). There was a steady increase in the proportion of S. sonnei isolates within the region(p<0.001). The average annual percentage increase (AAPI) in nonsusceptibility was 18.4% (p<0.001) for ciprofloxacin (baseline = 0.3); and 13.2%(p<0.001) for NA (baseline = 3). AAPI nonsusceptibility to ciprofloxacin was 13.3% for S. flexneri (p<0.04); and 39.9% for S. sonnei (p<0.001). Honduras, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and Chile reported the highest increase in nonsusceptibility to ciprofloxacin among all Shigella isolates. Conclusion There is an increasing trend in Shigella nonsusceptibility to ciprofloxacin and NA, including among the most common shigella species, in Latin America. This rise of nonsusceptibility among Shigella species to commonly used treatments such as ciprofloxacin is alarming and threatens the control and management of this currently treatable infection. Improved data quality, collection and reporting is needed in Latin America to respond effectively to the rising trends observed. This includes the need for quality isolate level epidemiological data; molecular data, and data on antibiotic consumption and use."
https://openalex.org/W2964793597,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) is derived from the proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), and the deposition of extracellular Aβ to form amyloid plaques is a pathologic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although reducing Aβ generation and accumulation has been proposed as a means of treating the disease, adverse side effects and unsatisfactory efficacy have been reported in several clinical trials that sought to lower Aβ levels. Engulfment adaptor phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain containing 1 (GULP1) is a molecular adaptor that has been shown to interact with APP to alter Aβ production. Therefore, the modulation of the GULP1-APP interaction may be an alternative approach to reducing Aβ. However, the mechanisms that regulate GULP1-APP binding remain elusive. As GULP1 is a phosphoprotein, and because phosphorylation is a common mechanism that regulates protein interaction, we anticipated that GULP1 phosphorylation would influence GULP1-APP interaction and thereby Aβ production. We show here that the phosphorylation of GULP1 threonine 35 (T35) reduces GULP1-APP interaction and suppresses the stimulatory effect of GULP1 on APP processing. The residue is phosphorylated by an isoform of atypical PKC (PKCζ). Overexpression of PKCζ reduces both GULP1-APP interaction and GULP1-mediated Aβ generation. Moreover, the activation of PKCζ via insulin suppresses APP processing. In contrast, GULP1-mediated APP processing is enhanced in PKCζ knockout cells. Similarly, PKC ι, another member of atypical PKC, also decreases GULP1-mediated APP processing. Intriguingly, our X-ray crystal structure of GULP1 PTB-APP intracellular domain (AICD) peptide reveals that GULP1 T35 is not located at the GULP1-AICD binding interface; rather, it immediately precedes the β1-α2 loop that forms a portion of the binding groove for the APP helix αC. Phosphorylating the residue may induce an allosteric effect on the conformation of the binding groove. Our results indicate that GULP1 T35 phosphorylation is a mechanism for the regulation of GULP1-APP interaction and thereby APP processing. Moreover, the activation of atypical PKC, such as by insulin, may confer a beneficial effect on AD by lowering GULP1-mediated Aβ production.-Chau, D. D.-L., Yung, K. W.-Y., Chan, W.

https://openalex.org/W2965187225,"Diet can affect the diversity and composition of gut microbiota. Usage of antibiotics in food production and in human or veterinary medicine has resulted in the emergence of commensal antibiotic resistant bacteria in the human gut. The incidence of erythromycin-resistant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the feces of healthy vegans, ovo-lacto vegetarians and omnivores was analyzed. Overall, 155 LAB were isolated and characterized for their phenotypic and genotypic resistance to erythromycin. The isolates belonged to 11 different species within the Enterococcus and Streptococcus genera. Enterococcus faecium was the dominant species in isolates from all the dietary categories. Only 97 out of 155 isolates were resistant to erythromycin after Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) determination; among them, 19 isolates (7 from vegans, 4 from ovo-lacto vegetarians and 8 from omnivores) carried the erm(B) gene. The copresence of erm(B) and erm(A) genes was only observed in Enterococcus avium from omnivores. Moreover, the transferability of erythromycin resistance genes using multidrug-resistant (MDR) cultures selected from the three groups was assessed, and four out of six isolates were able to transfer the erm(B) gene. Overall, isolates obtained from the omnivore samples showed resistance to a greater number of antibiotics and carried more tested antibiotic resistance genes compared to the isolates from ovo-lacto vegetarians and vegans. In conclusion, our results show that diet does not significantly affect the occurrence of erythromycin-resistant bacteria and that commensal strains may act as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance (AR) genes and as a source of antibiotic resistance spreading."
https://openalex.org/W2964673159,"The protection of constantly proliferating gut epithelia and hematopoietic tissues from cytotoxicity could improve conventional chemotherapy efficacy and widen its therapeutic window. Previously, we reported that, in mouse models, pretreatment of recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist (rhIL-1Ra) protected both types of vulnerable tissues from chemotherapeutics. Here, we showed that rhIL-1Ra treatment up-regulated the protein levels of phosphorylated p38, p53, and p21 and induced transient hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HS/PC) quiescence. Knockout of IL-1 receptor I (IL-1RI), p53, or p21 alleles and pharmacological inactivation of p38 mapped the rhIL-1Ra pathway in the induction of HS/PC quiescence. Therefore, rhIL-1Ra administration before but not after chemotherapy alleviated 5-fluorouracil-induced neutropenia. In addition, in vivo and in vitro cell proliferation assays revealed that the rhIL-1Ra treatment did not affect cancer cell proliferation or chemosensitivity. Lastly, we propose an IL-1/IL-1Ra pathway (IL-1RI → p38 → p53 → p21), which regulates HS/PC quiescence. The rhIL-1Ra may provide a new route for p53-based cyclotherapy, which spares normal cells but kills cancer cells during chemotherapy.-Ye, H., Qian, L., Zhu, S., Deng, S., Wang, X., Zhu, J., Chan, G.

Firstly, these different Linked Data services include: Linked Data Transformation Service (LDTS), Linked Data Query Service (LDQS), Linked Data Publishing Service (LDPS) and Linked Data Knowledge Service (LDKS). The resource URI is the basis and core of the linked data, thus we will focus on the resource forwarding mechanism in LDPS service which can rewrite resource URI using a global and standard format among knowledge bases. Some knowledge bases were configured in SinoPedia platform in this paper. In addition to the above services, Linked Data Reasoning Service (LDRS) and Linked Data Intelligence Service (LDIS) will be added to the platform in the future.

https://openalex.org/W2966119945,"Scleractinia of the Maputaland reef complex (MRC) in South Africa exist at the margins of the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) coral distribution and are the only substantial hermatypic coral communities in South Africa. Pocillopora species occupy a conspicuous component of the MRC, and previous investigations identified three species of Pocillopora utilizing conventional taxonomy. Thus, our aims were four-fold: to elucidate Pocillopora species diversity using genetic techniques, primarily using species delimitation methods based on the ORF gene; to test for the presence of hybridisation within the Pocillopora community on the South-West margin of distribution in the Indian Ocean using two nuclear and two mitochondrial markers; to test the presence of cryptic species, using 13 microsatellite markers, finally, to elucidate the degree of genetic diversity within each Pocillopora species found and compare this to communities in lower latitudes. We illustrate taxonomic inconsistencies between these inventories and our phylogenetic data. The MRC harbours unique populations of Pocillopora, consisting of three species hypothetically co-occurring throughout the south WIO, namely: P. meandrina/P. eydouxi, commonly misidentified as P. verrucosa, P. verrucosa, sometimes correctly identified, but also commonly misidentified as P. damicornis sensu lato, and P. villosa, almost always misidentified as P. eydouxi. The hypothesis that hybrid swarms of Pocillopora occur in marginal environments such as the MRC was not supported, with low levels of introgressive hybridization reported instead. Analyses illustrate low genetic diversity at the species and population resolutions, suggesting a small founder population for each species. Nevertheless, these populations are demographically unique, exhibiting high levels of ITS2 haplotype endemism compared to higher latitude populations and the rest of the WIO. Pocillopora diversity on the MRC represents a unique assemblage and warrants further protection."

https://openalex.org/W2964531887,"Calcium and phosphorus requirements for growing dogs can be calculated by different methods. The current standard feeding recommendations are based on experimental data derived from young giant breed puppies. In order to determine the absolute requirement, an extrapolation via metabolisable energy requirement is recommended. Another approach is to calculate the requirement factorially, taking into account the endogenous losses and the amount of calcium and phosphorus retained due to tissue accretion during growth as well as the expected availability of these nutrients. The working hypothesis was that both methods are valid and lead to comparable results in young puppies of a high mature body weight (BW). Yet, deviations for other age and mature BW groups were expected. Thus, the aim of the present study was to compare the results of both methods using exemplary puppies of different age and mature BW groups. The hypotheses could be verified for calcium. The extrapolated requirements overestimate the factorial requirements by up to 59.7% for puppies <60kg mature BW and/or >6 months of age. In case of phosphorus requirement, the deviations between both methods are overall very high in all stages. Taking into account the potentially harmful effects of calcium and phosphorus excess, the feeding recommendations based on the extrapolation should be reconsidered."

https://openalex.org/W2964908013,"“You are about to witness a thesis implode,” I declared to my summer student. As I ran the critical sample through the flow cytometer, my trembling hand betrayed my nervousness that the result would confirm my worst fears: I had been fooling myself. Three years prior, I had been a bright-eyed first-year Ph.D. student. “This is guaranteed to give you data,” my mentor had said of the project he wanted me to take over. Preliminary data suggested that a poorly understood protein might trigger immune cells to kill cancer cells. It was an exciting possibility, but I was concerned. The previous rotation student had been unable to replicate the finding and wasn't convinced the protein did anything at all. But I couldn't turn down a project that sounded so promising.

> “I had been spinning a story … instead of critically examining the facts.” 

To my relief, a new batch of protein I prepared yielded striking results. The science unfurled into a thrilling jigsaw puzzle. Beautiful flow cytometry plots revealed that our protein induced immune cells to mature. In tissue culture experiments, these cells killed cancer cells with startling ferocity. The debut in vivo study showed that mice treated with the protein had only a fraction of the black melanoma spots we found in controls. I presented the results—collected on Christmas Eve, no less—at our weekly lab meeting with a mother's pride: A causes B causes C, in perfect alignment with our neatly constructed hypotheses.

The results were so astounding, in fact, that they began to make me suspicious. I—along with my thesis committee members and adviser—wondered whether my results could be due to contamination from the bacterial system I used to produce the protein. After all, it seemed logical that a fragment of a pathogen, not our protein, could be what triggered the immune cells. However, I was soon reassured. I tested for contamination, looking for global immune activation, and everything looked clean. Relieved, I carried on.

But about a year later, a reviewer for a grant application identified a flaw in the control I had put my trust in. It was a largely unknown quirk in immunology, heretofore untested because my committee members—like me and my adviser—saw the logical sense of the story I had synthesized. That is what led to the fateful moment at the flow cytometer, where I was testing a commercial sample of my protein certified to be free of any bacterial contaminants—a crucial control that I had previously been too blinded by preconceived expectations to devise.

I was aghast when I saw that my protein in this pure state did nothing. My rotation student glanced at me, concerned. I chuckled darkly. I realized that I had been spinning a story from my science, interpreting my results based on my conception of what should be happening instead of critically examining the facts in front of me.

I stepped away from the lab bench for a week and confronted my mistakes with brutal honesty that ended up being cathartic. My adviser did the same. I leaned on generous loved ones as I worked through what felt like the five stages of grief. At first, I lamented the loss of my tidy, compelling story, but I eventually realized that element of my grief was misplaced. As scientists, we seek to understand nature's crooked truth. To simplify it—as tempting as that can be—is contrary to our quest to do meaningful science. It took me 6 months to recover and find closure by taking on a new project. My adviser supported my new direction, and eventually I graduated with my Ph.D.

I was burned, but the scars remind me to be a better scientist. Nowadays, I don't stop at controls. I really ponder my results. Could the cause be something other than what I expect? I am slower to draw easy conclusions and instead make sure to consider every possible variable. I have learned to detach myself from what I want my science to be, and instead allow the science to lead me to understanding what actually is. I listen to my doubts, no matter how much the puzzle fits and “makes sense” at first—or 20th—glance.
