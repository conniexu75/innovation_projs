https://openalex.org/W1782728159,"Abstract An unusual tryptic peptide isolated from the protein, prothrombin, has recently been shown to contain at least a portion of the vitamin K-dependent region of this protein (Nelsestuen, G. L., and Suttie, J. W. (1973) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 70, 3366–3370). A modified glutamylserine dipeptide has been isolated from proteolytic digests of this vitamin K-dependent peptide and has been characterized. It has been unambiguously demonstrated that the glutamic acid of the glutamylserine has been substituted by carboxylation of the γ carbon atom so that the dipeptide structure is: [see PDF for equation] Presumably, the incorporation of the second γ-carboxyl group is dependent on vitamin K."
https://openalex.org/W1535820474,"Abstract An improved electron density map has been obtained for the thermostable protease thermolysin. The map, calculated at a nominal resolution of 2.3 A, was based on the three heavy atom isomorphs described previously and on data for the zinc-free and europium-substituted enzyme. The zinc-free and native enzymes are closely isomorphous, and the difference in electron density between them shows that the only structural changes which occur on the removal of the zinc ion are slight adjustments in residues in the immediate vicinity of the metal ion. The approximate conformation of most of the thermolysin molecule is revealed without ambiguity, and preliminary atomic coordinates are presented. Some aspects of the molecular stereochemistry are discussed, including tertiary folding, helices, turns, and calcium binding sites. The peptide dihedral angles for most of the residues lie within or near the allowed regions for an empirical hard sphere model, but the conformations of a few residues lie in disallowed regions. There are several indications that the angle τ at the α carbon atom must be significantly greater than the tetrahedral for a number of residues. With the possible exception of the four calcium binding sites, there is nothing particularly unusual in the thermolysin conformation to which one might attribute the thermostability of the molecule. It is suggested that the enhanced stability of thermostable proteins relative to thermolabile ones cannot be attributed to a common determinant such as metal ion or hydrophobic stabilization, but in a given instance may be due to rather subtle differences in hydrophobic character, metal binding, hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions, or a combination of all of these."
https://openalex.org/W2005798057,"About 30% of HeLa cell mRNA lacks poly(A) when labeled in the presence of different rRNA inhibitors. Our method of RNA fractionation precludes contamination of the poly(A)− mRNA with large amounts of poly(A)+ sequences. The poly(A)− species is associated with polyribosomes, has an average sedimentation value equal to or greater than poly(A)+ mRNA, and behaves like the poly(A)+ mRNA in its sensitivity to EDTA and puromycin release from polyribosomes. There is very little, if any, hybridization at Rot values characteristic of abundant RNA sequences between the poly(A)− RNA fractions from total cytoplasm or from polyribosomes and 3H-cDNA made to poly(A)+ RNA. This indicates that poly(A)− mRNA does not arise from poly(A)+ mRNA by nonadenylation, deadenylation, or degradation of random abundant mRNA sequences. The rate of accumulation of poly(A)− mRNA larger than 9S in the cytoplasm parallels the accumulation of poly(A)− mRNA. The poly(A)− mRNA is maintained as approximately 30% of the total labeled mRNA in a short (90 min) and in a long (20 hr) time period. These data indicate that poly(A)− mRNA is not short-lived nuclear or cytoplasmic heterogeneous RNA contamination, and that the half-life of the poly(A)− mRNA may parallel that of the poly(A)+ mRNA. Cordycepin appears to almost completely (95%) inhibit poly(A)+ mRNA while only partially (60%) inhibiting the poly(A)− mRNA. The origin of the cordycepin-insensitive mRNA has not been ascertained."
https://openalex.org/W1578071727,"Abstract Human erythrocyte membranes were extracted with 0.1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetate, pH 8.0, the residue was dissolved in Triton X-100, and the soluble fraction was applied to Sepharose derivatives of concanavalin A (Con A) or the phytohemagglutinin from Lens culinaris (LCPHA). Examination of the material retained by the insolubilized lectins and subsequently eluted with α-methyl mannoside reveals that the principal high affinity receptor for Con A is the minor glycoprotein (also called Band III and Component a). This protein is also thought to be the agent responsible for anion transport across the membrane of the human red blood cell. LCPHA is capable of binding the above polypeptide and the major sialoglycoprotein. Evidence is given to show that this binding is specific. The lectins retain quantitatively different fractions of the minor glycoprotein, the remainder of the protein being unretarded. It is suggested that this behavior may reflect heterogeneity in the carbohydrate moiety of the protein. Finally, the possible association of the Con A receptor protein with the intramembranous particles of the erythrocyte membrane is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1996202650,"Several recent technological advances have increased the practicality and usefulness of the technique of electron microscopy of wet objects. (i) There have been gains in the effective penetration of high-voltage microscopes, scanning transmission microscopes, and high-voltage scanning microscopes. The extra effective penetration gives more scope for obtaining good images through film windows, gas, and liquid layers. (ii) Improved methods of obtaining contrast are available (especially dark field and inelastic filtering) that often make it possible to obtain sufficient contrast with wet unstained objects. (iii) Improved environmental chamber design makes it possible to insert and examine wet specimens as easily as dry specimens. The ultimate achievable resolution for wet objects in an environmental chamber will gradually become clear experimentally. Resolution is mainly a function of gas path, liquid and wet specimen thickness, specimen stage stability, acceleration voltage, and image mode (fixed or scanning beam) (13). Much depends on the development of the technique for controlling the thickness of extraneous water film around wet objects or the technique for depositing wet objects onto dry, hydrophobic support films. Although some loss of resolution due to water or gas scattering will always occur, an effective gain is anticipated in preserving the shape of individual molecules and preventing the partial collapse that usually occurs on drying or negative staining. The most basic question for biological electron microscopy is probably whether any living functions of cells can be observed so that the capabilities of the phase contrast and interference light microscopes can be extended. Investigators are now rapidly approaching a final answer to this question. The two limiting factors are (i) maintaining cell motility in spread cells immersed in thin layers of media and (ii) reducing beam radiation damage to an acceptable level. The use of sensitive emulsions and image intensifiers can bring the observation dose below that required to stop cell motility. Use of a timed, pulsed deflector system enables sufficiently short exposures to be obtained to eliminate blurring due to Brownian motion. Environmental chambers have enhanced the possibilities of electron diffraction analysis of minute crystals and ordered biological structures. High-resolution electron diffraction patterns (especially kinematic) of protein crystals can only be obtained in a wet environment. Hence, it may now be possible to obtain undistorted images of protein molecules. Moreover, by subjecting diffraction patterns to image-iterative techniques (56), it will be possible to phase the electron diffraction patterns to give a calculated image with a higher resolution than that which can be produced by electron microscope objective lenses. Environmental chambers offer exciting prospects for the determination of water structure and water and ice nucleation (atmospheric science). Nucleation data near the molecular level have been badly needed for some time. The application of environmental chambers in industrial chemistry, for example, in studies of polymerization, catalysis, and corrosion, are awaiting exploration. They offer an unusual approach to measurements of reaction kinetics through images that should be both sensitive and rapid."
https://openalex.org/W1484304115,"Abstract (l)-Tetrahydropteroyltriglutamate and (l)-tetrahydropteroylhexaglutamate were prepared and tested as substrates for thymidylate synthetase (EC 2.1.1.6) (methylenetetrahydrofolate:deoxyuridylate C-methyltransferase) from Lactobacillus casei. Both tetrahydropteroylpolyglutamates were more effective substrates than (l)-tetrahydropteroylglutamate, enhancing the reaction rate 3-fold when compared at 10-5 m. Pteroylpolyglutamates and their corresponding dihydro and (d)-tetrahydro forms were inhibitors of the enzyme, the inhibitory potency increasing with the number of glutamyl residues. The concentration for 50% inhibition with pteroylglutamate was 1.5 x 10-4 m and for pteroylhexaglutamate 6 x 10-7 m. Inhibition by pteroylhexaglutamate, but not that by pteroylglutamate, was abolished in the presence of 0.4 m NaCl. Inhibition obtained with dihydropteroylhexaglutamate and dihydropteroyltriglutamate (50% at 3.2 x 10-6 m) is sufficient to warrant consideration of these compounds as physiological regulators of thymidylate formation. p-Aminobenzoylhexaglutamate and hexaglutamate did not inhibit thymidylate synthetase at 10-2 m indicating that polyglutamates do not bind to the enzyme in the absence of the pteridine. Dihydropteroyltriglutamate and dihydropteroylhexaglutamate were no more effective than dihydropteroylglutamate as substrates for dihydrofolate reductase (EC 1.5.1.3) (5, 6, 7, 8-tetrahydropteroylglutamate:nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidoreductase) from L. casei."

https://openalex.org/W2146469504,"The program of protein synthesis that accompanies cellular differentiation following transfer of the blue-green alga Nostoc muscorum from nitrogen-containing to nitrogen-free medium has been determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of whole cell proteins labeled with 35SO4= during successive intervals of the differentiation. Differentiating cells (proheterocysts, which become heterocysts) are distinguished from vegetative cells on the basis of the latter's susceptibility to lysis with lysozyme. At least ten sets of proteins can be distinguished on the basis of the time at which they are synthesized or the type of cell in which they are located. Regulation of most of these sets can be accounted for by classical induction or repression involving NH4+ or a simple derivative of NH4+. An additional mechanism is required to explain how the synthesis of several sets of proteins is initiated in all cells following transfer to nitrogen-free medium, but is permitted to continue only in developing proheterocysts. The structural polypeptides of the nitrogenase enzyme complex are members of the latter set. In differentiated filaments, very few proteins are synthesized in both vegetative cells and heterocysts. The qualitatively different pattern of protein synthesis is established very early, within the first 9 hr after transfer. Moreover, the proteins present in proheterocysts at that time are already qualitatively different from those of vegetative cells. Rapid turnover of vegetative cell proteins appears to be a characteristic of the early development of proheterocysts."

https://openalex.org/W1516564694,"Abstract The purified serogroup X meningococcal polysaccharide contains equimolar proportions of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d- glucose and phosphate as its sole constituents. Under conditions of mild acid hydrolysis the polysaccharide yielded only 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucose 4-phosphate, indicating that the adjacent acetamido sugar units are linked by 1→4 phosphodiester bonds. Other studies on the polysaccharide indicate that it is linear, has an average chain length of 50 units, and that the glycosidic phosphodiester bonds are in the α configuration. Serological studies on the polysaccharide have shown that its antiserum is highly specific for the position of linkage of the phosphodiester bonds. Also, the poor inhibitory properties, to the precipitin reaction, of the α-1-phosphate and 4-phosphate monomers indicate that the main serological specificity is probably directed to oligomer units. The polysaccharide was isolated by a method involving buffered phenol extraction, to remove protein contaminants, with subsequent treatment by ribonuclease, to remove nucleic acid. This rapid and simple procedure is adaptable to the isolation of other meningococcal polysaccharides (serogroups A, B, C, Y, and Z) in both good yields and a high degree of purity."
https://openalex.org/W1567712837,"Abstract The isolated rat liver perfused for 12 or 24 hours has been used to study effects of total hypophysectomy of the liver donor, and of added cortisol, bovine growth hormone, insulin, and triiodothyronine on the net biosynthesis of five specific plasma proteins, namely, rat serum albumin, fibrinogen, α1-acid glycoprotein, α2-(acute phase) globulin, and haptoglobin. With all four hormonal supplements livers from fed hypophysectomized rats perfused at pH 7.10 synthesized about 50% as much albumin as livers from normal donors. Similarly with a supplement including all four hormones, synthesis of fibrinogen, α1-acid glycoprotein, and haptoglobin was close to that observed in normals. Elimination of either growth hormone, insulin or triiodothyronine, had effects which varied depending on the hormone deleted and the specific plasma protein in question. Fibrinogen synthesis in the absence of triiodothyronine was not different from that with the four hormones; however, deletion of either the supplement of insulin or growth hormone resulted in a small but significant decrease in net synthesis below that seen with the four hormones. Deletion of either triiodothyronine, growth hormone, or insulin was associated with failure to increase synthesis of haptoglobin above that seen in the absence of all hormones at 12 hours, and at 24 hours was only 50% of that with supplementation by all four hormones. In the absence of hormone supplements synthesis of α2-(acute phase) globulin by livers from hypophysectomized donors was undetectable. With all four hormones synthesis of this protein was not significantly different from that by livers of normal donors. Omission of either triiodothyronine, insulin, or growth hormone diminished the net synthesis of the protein in a manner closely similar to that observed with haptoglobin. Of the four hormones, omission of insulin or growth hormone was reflected in a small but significant decrease in net uptake of free amino acid nitrogen. Strongly positive nitrogen balance for the perfusion system was referable mainly to normal amino acid uptake concomitant with significantly decreased urea production and to the presence of insulin. Absence of insulin (even in the presence of growth hormone, triiodothyronine, and cortisol) was associated with increased urea production, negative nitrogen balance, and reduced incorporation of l-[1-14C]lysine into hepatic protien."

https://openalex.org/W1553068808,"Abstract The Forssman glycolipid hapten was isolated from horse kidney and analyzed by direct inlet mass spectrometry of undergraded lipid derivatives. Methylated glycolipid gave no molecular ions, but some important carbohydrate sequence and ceramide (fatty acid and long chain base) ions. After reduction of this derivative with LiAlH4 (amide group of ceramide and of amino sugars were converted to the corresponding amines) a molecular weight ion (at m/e 1782) was recorded, as well as ions which were conclusive for the type and exact ratio of sugars and their sequence. Without any conventional degradative studies it was possible to conclude that the glycolipid was a pentaglycosyl-ceramide with the sequence hexosamine-hexosamine-hexose-hexose-hexose-ceramide, as first proposed by B. Siddiqui and S. Hakomori ((1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 5766–5769). The fatty acids were mainly nervonic (24:1) and lignoceric (24:0) acid but also C16 to C23 fatty acids. Both sphingosine and phytosphingosine were present. Evidence was obtained from the spectra for a preferential combination of long chain (24) fatty acid and phytosphingosine."

Each antibody had a different and distinctive primary structure within each of the two ""hypervariable"" regions (Hv1 and Hv2) included in the analyzed part of the variable region of the heavy chain. The sequences of Hv1 and Hv2 in the three antibodies were either unique or of restricted variability compared with those of ""normal"" immunoglobulin G2. Further implication of Hv1 and Hv2 in contributing to ligand-binding specificity of antibodies came from the placement of residues modified by affinity labeling reagents in these hypervariable regions."

https://openalex.org/W1486894952,"Abstract [14C]Penicillin G bound to the Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus stearothermophilus d-alanine carboxypeptidases in either the membrane-bound or purified states. This binding was subsequently reversed with a half-time ranging from 10 min to several days, depending on the enzyme, the penicillin derivative, and the temperature. The released material was neither intact penicillin nor penicilloic acid but rather some other penicillin derivative. The enzymes were thus formally penicillinases of low activity, although they were not β-lactamases. In addition to the release catalyzed by the native enzyme, hydrolysis of the penicillin-enzyme complex also occurred under certain circumstances after enzyme denaturation. Prior to release from the enzyme, the penicillin appeared to be covalently bound. It was not released by boiling sodium dodecyl sulfate, by 8 m urea, or by 6 m guanidine HCl. Likewise, intact penicillin was not freed by digestion with pronase; the material released upon digestion was a mixture of penicilloic acid and an unidentified compound, possibly penicillin-peptide."

https://openalex.org/W1514764269,"Abstract A bifunctional enzyme, consisting of 3-deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonate 7-phosphate synthetase and chorismate mutase, has been purified to homogeneity from Bacillus subtilis. Ultracentrifugation revealed a single symmetrical peak of protein. A single protein band also was observed when the homogeneous preparation was subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate at pH 7.0. These data suggest that the protein consists of identical subunits. Following treatment of the purified protein with dimethyl suberimidate, four protein bands could be clearly distinguished upon electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. These four bands correspond to the monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer forms of the enzyme, as calculated from their molecular weights. The molecular weight of the monomer is about 38,500 as determined by its mobility following electrophoresis on polyacrylamide in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. This number corresponds closely to the minimum chemical molecular weight as calculated from the amino acid composition. The enzyme can exist as a tetramer of molecular weight 160,000 as determined by superfine Sephadex G-200 thin layer chromatography. Metal ions and chemical inhibitors affect the two enzyme activities quite differently, Cd+2 stimulates 3-deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonate 7-phosphate synthetase without any effect on chorismate mutase, while p-hydroxymercuribenzoate inhibits 3-deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonate 7-phosphate synthetase but not chorismate mutase."

It is now known, however, that they contain a number of hydrolytic enzymes at least one of which is a hydroxyproline-rich protein1. These enzymes are often of types associated with the dynamic recycling functions of intracellular lysosomes2–4. They have usually been detected by the activity of cell wall preparations after comminution of tissues and removal of contaminating cytoplasm by washing1,2,5 or by the activity of intact or excised roots3,6.

Preincubation of L. casei with methotrexate inhibited the incorporation of [3H]folic acid completely and l-5-formyl-[3H]tetrahydrofolic acid partially into pteroyloctaglutamate and increased the amount of pteroyltetraglutamate and lower polyglutamates. In rats, methotrexate was metabolized partially to lower methotrexate polyglutamates; however, its uptake was much lower than folic acid and no pentaglutamate of methotrexate was found. Pretreatment of rats with 100 µg of methotrexate daily for 5 days decreased the uptake of [3H]folic acid into liver considerably (∼20 to ∼8%) and the radioactivity in liver was mainly reduced derivatives of pteroylpentaglutamate. With treatment with 300 µg of methotrexate per day for 6 days, however, not only the uptake of [3H]folic acid decreased to ∼4%, but also pteroylpentaglutamate comprised only ∼50% of total radioactivity in liver and the rest was lower polyglutamate and unmetabolized monoglutamate.

This effect served as the basis for specifically B. subtilis with N-ethylmaleimide according to a procedure originally employed by Fox and Kennedy (Fox, C.F. and Kennedy, E. P. (1965) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 54, 891) for N-ethylmaleimide labeling the M-protein component of the lactose transport system of Escherichia coli. By means of this method, three proteins were detected in the membranes of l-malate-induced cells, but not of uninduced cells. These proteins were protected against reaction with N-ethylmaleimide by the presence of saturating amounts of l-malate. The electrophoretic mobilities of these proteins on polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate suggested they had subunit weights of 62,000, 44,000, and 33,000. That they were quantitatively minor components of the membrane was evidenced by the finding that direct labeling with amino acids did not consistently detect the presence of these proteins in the membrane of induced cells. Studies with substrate analogues established a direct correlation between the ability of a compound to competitively inhibit l-malate uptake and the ability of that same compound to protect against N-ethylmaleimide inactivation of C4-dicarboxylate transport activity. Moreover, meso-tartrate, a powerful competitive inhibitor of l-malate uptake, was capable not only of protecting transport activity against N-ethylmaleimide inactivation but also of protecting the 62,000- and 44,000-dalton proteins against reaction with N-ethylmaleimide. The 33,000-dalton protein was not protected against reaction with N-ethylmaleimide by meso-tartrate. l(+)-Tartrate, a poor competitive inhibitor of l-malate uptake, protected neither transport activity nor the 62,000-, 44,000-, or 33,000-dalton proteins from N-ethylmaleimide. A possible role for these proteins in the transport of dicarboxylic acids into B. subtilis is discussed."
