https://openalex.org/W1992826811,"Several genetic alterations characteristic of leukemia and lymphoma have been detected in the blood of individuals without apparent hematological malignancies. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provides a unique resource for comprehensive discovery of mutations and genes in blood that may contribute to the clonal expansion of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Here, we analyzed blood-derived sequence data from 2,728 individuals from TCGA and discovered 77 blood-specific mutations in cancer-associated genes, the majority being associated with advanced age. Remarkably, 83% of these mutations were from 19 leukemia and/or lymphoma-associated genes, and nine were recurrently mutated (DNMT3A, TET2, JAK2, ASXL1, TP53, GNAS, PPM1D, BCORL1 and SF3B1). We identified 14 additional mutations in a very small fraction of blood cells, possibly representing the earliest stages of clonal expansion in hematopoietic stem cells. Comparison of these findings to mutations in hematological malignancies identified several recurrently mutated genes that may be disease initiators. Our analyses show that the blood cells of more than 2% of individuals (5-6% of people older than 70 years) contain mutations that may represent premalignant events that cause clonal hematopoietic expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2056512830,"CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to edit both single and multiple genes in postmitotic neurons in adult mice enabling rapid assessment of gene functions in the brain. Probing gene function in the mammalian brain can be greatly assisted with methods to manipulate the genome of neurons in vivo. The clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated endonuclease (Cas)9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9)1 can be used to edit single or multiple genes in replicating eukaryotic cells, resulting in frame-shifting insertion/deletion (indel) mutations and subsequent protein depletion. Here, we delivered SpCas9 and guide RNAs using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to target single (Mecp2) as well as multiple genes (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) in the adult mouse brain in vivo. We characterized the effects of genome modifications in postmitotic neurons using biochemical, genetic, electrophysiological and behavioral readouts. Our results demonstrate that AAV-mediated SpCas9 genome editing can enable reverse genetic studies of gene function in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2018566131,"In the bone marrow, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) lodge in specialized microenvironments that tightly control the proliferative state of HSCs to adapt to the varying needs for replenishment of blood cells while also preventing HSC exhaustion. All putative niche cells suggested thus far have a nonhematopoietic origin. Thus, it remains unclear how feedback from mature cells is conveyed to HSCs to adjust their proliferation. Here we show that megakaryocytes (MKs) can directly regulate HSC pool size in mice. Three-dimensional whole-mount imaging revealed that endogenous HSCs are frequently located adjacent to MKs in a nonrandom fashion. Selective in vivo depletion of MKs resulted in specific loss of HSC quiescence and led to a marked expansion of functional HSCs. Gene expression analyses revealed that MKs are the source of chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 4 (CXCL4, also named platelet factor 4 or PF4) in the bone marrow, and we found that CXCL4 regulates HSC cell cycle activity. CXCL4 injection into mice resulted in a reduced number of HSCs because of their increased quiescence. By contrast, Cxcl4(-/-) mice exhibited an increased number of HSCs and increased HSC proliferation. Combined use of whole-mount imaging and computational modeling was highly suggestive of a megakaryocytic niche capable of independently influencing HSC maintenance by regulating quiescence. These results indicate that a terminally differentiated cell type derived from HSCs contributes to the HSC niche, directly regulating HSC behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2031522785,"Differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into organ-specific subtypes offers an exciting avenue for the study of embryonic development and disease processes, for pharmacologic studies and as a potential resource for therapeutic transplant. To date, limited in vivo models exist for human intestine, all of which are dependent upon primary epithelial cultures or digested tissue from surgical biopsies that include mesenchymal cells transplanted on biodegradable scaffolds. Here, we generated human intestinal organoids (HIOs) produced in vitro from human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that can engraft in vivo. These HIOs form mature human intestinal epithelium with intestinal stem cells contributing to the crypt-villus architecture and a laminated human mesenchyme, both supported by mouse vasculature ingrowth. In vivo transplantation resulted in marked expansion and maturation of the epithelium and mesenchyme, as demonstrated by differentiated intestinal cell lineages (enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells, tuft cells and enteroendocrine cells), presence of functional brush-border enzymes (lactase, sucrase-isomaltase and dipeptidyl peptidase 4) and visible subepithelial and smooth muscle layers when compared with HIOs in vitro. Transplanted intestinal tissues demonstrated digestive functions as shown by permeability and peptide uptake studies. Furthermore, transplanted HIO-derived tissue was responsive to systemic signals from the host mouse following ileocecal resection, suggesting a role for circulating factors in the intestinal adaptive response. This model of the human small intestine may pave the way for studies of intestinal physiology, disease and translational studies."

https://openalex.org/W2017814058,"We found that optogenetic burst stimulation of hippocampal dopaminergic fibers from midbrain neurons in mice exploring novel environments enhanced the reactivation of pyramidal cell assemblies during subsequent sleep/rest. When applied during spatial learning of new goal locations, dopaminergic photostimulation improved the later recall of neural representations of space and stabilized memory performance. These findings reveal that midbrain dopaminergic neurons promote hippocampal network dynamics associated with memory persistence."

https://openalex.org/W2026077861,"Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), composed of truncated and hyperphosphorylated tau, are a common feature of numerous aging-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular mechanisms mediating tau truncation and aggregation during aging remain elusive. Here we show that asparagine endopeptidase (AEP), a lysosomal cysteine proteinase, is activated during aging and proteolytically degrades tau, abolishes its microtubule assembly function, induces tau aggregation and triggers neurodegeneration. AEP is upregulated and active during aging and is activated in human AD brain and tau P301S-transgenic mice with synaptic pathology and behavioral impairments, leading to tau truncation in NFTs. Tau P301S-transgenic mice with deletion of the gene encoding AEP show substantially reduced tau hyperphosphorylation, less synapse loss and rescue of impaired hippocampal synaptic function and cognitive deficits. Mice infected with adeno-associated virus encoding an uncleavable tau mutant showed attenuated pathological and behavioral defects compared to mice injected with adeno-associated virus encoding tau P301S. Together, these observations indicate that AEP acts as a crucial mediator of tau-related clinical and neuropathological changes. Inhibition of AEP may be therapeutically useful for treating tau-mediated neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2026934012,"The solar atmosphere was traditionally represented with a simple one-dimensional model. Over the past few decades, this paradigm shifted for the chromosphere and corona that constitute the outer atmosphere, which is now considered a dynamic structured envelope. Recent observations by IRIS (Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph) reveal that it is difficult to determine what is up and down even in the cool 6000-K photosphere just above the solar surface: this region hosts pockets of hot plasma transiently heated to almost 100,000 K. The energy to heat and accelerate the plasma requires a considerable fraction of the energy from flares, the largest solar disruptions. These IRIS observations not only confirm that the photosphere is more complex than conventionally thought, but also provide insight into the energy conversion in the process of magnetic reconnection."
https://openalex.org/W2156067749,"Complete knowledge of the genetic variation in individual human genomes is a crucial foundation for understanding the etiology of disease. Genetic variation is typically characterized by sequencing individual genomes and comparing reads to a reference. Existing methods do an excellent job of detecting variants in approximately 90% of the human genome; however, calling variants in the remaining 10% of the genome (largely low-complexity sequence and segmental duplications) is challenging. To improve variant calling, we developed a new algorithm, DISCOVAR, and examined its performance on improved, low-cost sequence data. Using a newly created reference set of variants from the finished sequence of 103 randomly chosen fosmids, we find that some standard variant call sets miss up to 25% of variants. We show that the combination of new methods and improved data increases sensitivity by several fold, with the greatest impact in challenging regions of the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W2073405971,"The next generation of genetically engineered mouse models of pancreatic cancer involving a new inducible dual-recombinase system that combines Flp-FRT and Cre-loxP. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) have dramatically improved our understanding of tumor evolution and therapeutic resistance. However, sequential genetic manipulation of gene expression and targeting of the host is almost impossible using conventional Cre-loxP–based models. We have developed an inducible dual-recombinase system by combining flippase-FRT (Flp-FRT) and Cre-loxP recombination technologies to improve GEMMs of pancreatic cancer. This enables investigation of multistep carcinogenesis, genetic manipulation of tumor subpopulations (such as cancer stem cells), selective targeting of the tumor microenvironment and genetic validation of therapeutic targets in autochthonous tumors on a genome-wide scale. As a proof of concept, we performed tumor cell–autonomous and nonautonomous targeting, recapitulated hallmarks of human multistep carcinogenesis, validated genetic therapy by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase inactivation as well as cancer cell depletion and show that mast cells in the tumor microenvironment, which had been thought to be key oncogenic players, are dispensable for tumor formation."
https://openalex.org/W1998944024,"Her3 (also known as ErbB3) belongs to the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and is well credentialed as an anti-cancer target but is thought to be 'undruggable' using ATP-competitive small molecules because it lacks appreciable kinase activity. Here we report what is to our knowledge the first selective Her3 ligand, TX1-85-1, that forms a covalent bond with Cys721 located in the ATP-binding site of Her3. We demonstrate that covalent modification of Her3 inhibits Her3 signaling but not proliferation in some Her3-dependent cancer cell lines. Subsequent derivatization with a hydrophobic adamantane moiety demonstrates that the resultant bivalent ligand (TX2-121-1) enhances inhibition of Her3-dependent signaling. Treatment of cells with TX2-121-1 results in partial degradation of Her3 and serendipitously interferes with productive heterodimerization between Her3 with either Her2 or c-Met. These results suggest that small molecules will be capable of perturbing the biological function of Her3 and ∼60 other pseudokinases found in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2081770828,"Haplotype-resolved genome sequencing enables the accurate interpretation of medically relevant genetic variation, deep inferences regarding population history and non-invasive prediction of fetal genomes. We describe an approach for genome-wide haplotyping based on contiguity-preserving transposition (CPT-seq) and combinatorial indexing. Tn5 transposition is used to modify DNA with adaptor and index sequences while preserving contiguity. After DNA dilution and compartmentalization, the transposase is removed, resolving the DNA into individually indexed libraries. The libraries in each compartment, enriched for neighboring genomic elements, are further indexed via PCR. Combinatorial 96-plex indexing at both the transposition and PCR stage enables the construction of phased synthetic reads from each of the nearly 10,000 'virtual compartments'. We demonstrate the feasibility of this method by assembling >95% of the heterozygous variants in a human genome into long, accurate haplotype blocks (N50 = 1.4-2.3 Mb). The rapid, scalable and cost-effective workflow could enable haplotype resolution to become routine in human genome sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W2033422581,"Hepatitis A virus (HAV) remains enigmatic, despite 1.4 million cases worldwide annually. It differs radically from other picornaviruses, existing in an enveloped form and being unusually stable, both genetically and physically, but has proved difficult to study. Here we report high-resolution X-ray structures for the mature virus and the empty particle. The structures of the two particles are indistinguishable, apart from some disorder on the inside of the empty particle. The full virus contains the small viral protein VP4, whereas the empty particle harbours only the uncleaved precursor, VP0. The smooth particle surface is devoid of depressions that might correspond to receptor-binding sites. Peptide scanning data extend the previously reported VP3 antigenic site, while structure-based predictions suggest further epitopes. HAV contains no pocket factor and can withstand remarkably high temperature and low pH, and empty particles are even more robust than full particles. The virus probably uncoats via a novel mechanism, being assembled differently to other picornaviruses. It utilizes a VP2 'domain swap' characteristic of insect picorna-like viruses, and structure-based phylogenetic analysis places HAV between typical picornaviruses and the insect viruses. The enigmatic properties of HAV may reflect its position as a link between 'modern' picornaviruses and the more 'primitive' precursor insect viruses; for instance, HAV retains the ability to move from cell-to-cell by transcytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2170518318,"The physical processes causing energy exchange between the Sun’s hot corona and its cool lower atmosphere remain poorly understood. The chromosphere and transition region (TR) form an interface region between the surface and the corona that is highly sensitive to the coronal heating mechanism. High-resolution observations with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) reveal rapid variability (~20 to 60 seconds) of intensity and velocity on small spatial scales (≲500 kilometers) at the footpoints of hot and dynamic coronal loops. The observations are consistent with numerical simulations of heating by beams of nonthermal electrons, which are generated in small impulsive (≲30 seconds) heating events called “coronal nanoflares.” The accelerated electrons deposit a sizable fraction of their energy (≲10 25 erg) in the chromosphere and TR. Our analysis provides tight constraints on the properties of such electron beams and new diagnostics for their presence in the nonflaring corona."
https://openalex.org/W2115310651,"The solar chromosphere and transition region (TR) form an interface between the Sun's surface and its hot outer atmosphere. Here most of the non-thermal energy that powers the solar atmosphere is transformed into heat, although the detailed mechanism remains elusive. High-resolution (0.33-arcsec) observations with NASA's Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) reveal a chromosphere and TR that are replete with twist or torsional motions on sub-arcsecond scales, occurring in active regions, quiet Sun regions, and coronal holes alike. We coordinated observations with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) to quantify these twisting motions and their association with rapid heating to at least TR temperatures. This view of the interface region provides insight into what heats the low solar atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2052814807,"Synaptic remodeling in the brain is dependent on the extracellular matrix remodeling mediated by zinc-dependent matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Using a rodent model, this study shows that the activity of MMP2 and 9 are differentially increased in the brain region nucleus accumbens after withdrawal from self-administered cocaine, during cue-induced relapse. Along with a similar response following relapse to other drugs of abuse, the study also shows that the increased MMP activity was needed for both relapse behavior and relapse-associated synaptic plasticity that included changes to the glutamate-mediated currents and dendritic spine head diameter. Relapse to cocaine use necessitates remodeling excitatory synapses in the nucleus accumbens and synaptic reorganization requires matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) degradation of the extracellular matrix proteins. We found enduring increases in MMP-2 activity in rats after withdrawal from self-administered cocaine and transient increases in MMP-9 during cue-induced cocaine relapse. Cue-induced heroin and nicotine relapse increased MMP activity, and increased MMP activity was required for both cocaine relapse and relapse-associated synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2062523885,"Evan Eichler and colleagues present a detailed characterization of the chromosome 15q13.3 microdeletion region. They identify complex structural polymorphisms and find that the rearrangement breakpoints cluster in palindromic GOLGA8 core duplicons, providing evidence that this repeat and its palindromic architecture underlie the evolutionary and disease-related instability of this region. Recurrent deletions of chromosome 15q13.3 associate with intellectual disability, schizophrenia, autism and epilepsy. To gain insight into the instability of this region, we sequenced it in affected individuals, normal individuals and nonhuman primates. We discovered five structural configurations of the human chromosome 15q13.3 region ranging in size from 2 to 3 Mb. These configurations arose recently (∼0.5–0.9 million years ago) as a result of human-specific expansions of segmental duplications and two independent inversion events. All inversion breakpoints map near GOLGA8 core duplicons—a ∼14-kb primate-specific chromosome 15 repeat that became organized into larger palindromic structures. GOLGA8-flanked palindromes also demarcate the breakpoints of recurrent 15q13.3 microdeletions, the expansion of chromosome 15 segmental duplications in the human lineage and independent structural changes in apes. The significant clustering (P = 0.002) of breakpoints provides mechanistic evidence for the role of this core duplicon and its palindromic architecture in promoting the evolutionary and disease-related instability of chromosome 15."
https://openalex.org/W2036101780,"Evolutionary pressure for protein function leads to unavoidable sampling of conformational states that are at risk of misfolding and aggregation. The resulting tension between functional requirements and the risk of misfolding and/or aggregation in the evolution of proteins is becoming more and more apparent. One outcome of this tension is sensitivity to mutation, in which only subtle changes in sequence that may be functionally advantageous can tip the delicate balance toward protein aggregation. Similarly, increasing the concentration of aggregation-prone species by reducing the ability to control protein levels or compromising protein folding capacity engenders increased risk of aggregation and disease. In this Perspective, we describe examples that epitomize the tension between protein functional energy landscapes and aggregation risk. Each case illustrates how the energy landscapes for the at-risk proteins are sculpted to enable them to perform their functions and how the risks of aggregation are minimized under cellular conditions using a variety of compensatory mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2156586457,"The heating of the outer solar atmospheric layers, i.e., the transition region and corona, to high temperatures is a long standing problem in solar (and stellar) physics. Solutions have been hampered by an incomplete understanding of the magnetically controlled structure of these regions. The high spatial and temporal resolution observations with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) at the solar limb reveal a plethora of short, low lying loops or loop segments at transition-region temperatures that vary rapidly, on the timescales of minutes. We argue that the existence of these loops solves a long standing observational mystery. At the same time, based on comparison with numerical models, this detection sheds light on a critical piece of the coronal heating puzzle."
https://openalex.org/W1986557532,"Evasion of killing by the complement system, a crucial part of innate immunity, is a key evolutionary strategy of many human pathogens. A major etiological agent of chronic periodontitis, the Gram-negative bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis, produces a vast arsenal of virulence factors that compromise human defense mechanisms. One of these is peptidylarginine deiminase (PPAD), an enzyme unique to P. gingivalis among bacteria, which converts Arg residues in polypeptide chains into citrulline. Here, we report that PPAD citrullination of a critical C-terminal arginine of the anaphylatoxin C5a disabled the protein function. Treatment of C5a with PPAD in vitro resulted in decreased chemotaxis of human neutrophils and diminished calcium signaling in monocytic cell line U937 transfected with the C5a receptor (C5aR) and loaded with a fluorescent intracellular calcium probe: Fura-2 AM. Moreover, a low degree of citrullination of internal arginine residues by PPAD was also detected using mass spectrometry. Further, after treatment of C5 with outer membrane vesicles naturally shed by P. gingivalis, we observed generation of C5a totally citrullinated at the C-terminal Arg-74 residue (Arg74Cit). In stark contrast, only native C5a was detected after treatment with PPAD-null outer membrane vesicles. Our study suggests reduced antibacterial and proinflammatory capacity of citrullinated C5a, achieved via lower level of chemotactic potential of the modified molecule, and weaker cell activation. In the context of previous studies, which showed crosstalk between C5aR and Toll-like receptors, as well as enhanced arthritis development in mice infected with PPAD-expressing P. gingivalis, our findings support a crucial role of PPAD in the virulence of P. gingivalis."
https://openalex.org/W2054358775,"Expectations have a powerful influence on how we experience the world. Neurobiological and computational models of learning suggest that dopamine is crucial for shaping expectations of reward and that expectations alone may influence dopamine levels. However, because expectations and reinforcers are typically manipulated together, the role of expectations per se has remained unclear. We separated these two factors using a placebo dopaminergic manipulation in individuals with Parkinson's disease. We combined a reward learning task with functional magnetic resonance imaging to test how expectations of dopamine release modulate learning-related activity in the brain. We found that the mere expectation of dopamine release enhanced reward learning and modulated learning-related signals in the striatum and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These effects were selective to learning from reward: neither medication nor placebo had an effect on learning to avoid monetary loss. These findings suggest a neurobiological mechanism by which expectations shape learning and affect."
https://openalex.org/W2034096326,"Class V myosins are actin-based motors with conserved functions in vesicle and organelle trafficking. Herein we report the discovery of a function for Myosin Vc in melanosome biogenesis as an effector of melanosome-associated Rab GTPases. We isolated Myosin Vc in a yeast two-hybrid screening for proteins that interact with Rab38, a Rab protein involved in the biogenesis of melanosomes and other lysosome-related organelles. Rab38 and its close homolog Rab32 bind to Myosin Vc but not to Myosin Va or Myosin Vb. Binding depends on residues in the switch II region of Rab32 and Rab38 and regions of the Myosin Vc coiled-coil tail domain. Myosin Vc also interacts with Rab7a and Rab8a but not with Rab11, Rab17, and Rab27. Although Myosin Vc is not particularly abundant on pigmented melanosomes, its knockdown in MNT-1 melanocytes caused defects in the trafficking of integral membrane proteins to melanosomes with substantially increased surface expression of Tyrp1, nearly complete loss of Tyrp2, and significant Vamp7 mislocalization. Knockdown of Myosin Vc in MNT-1 cells more than doubled the abundance of pigmented melanosomes but did not change the number of unpigmented melanosomes. Together the data demonstrate a novel role for Myosin Vc in melanosome biogenesis and secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2019130506,"Benzylquinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA) is the first highly selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM) for the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR), but it possesses low affinity for the allosteric site on the receptor. More recent drug discovery efforts identified 3-((1S,2S)-2-hydroxycyclohexyl)-6-((6-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)pyridin-3-yl)methyl)benzo[h]quinazolin-4(3H)-one (referred to herein as benzoquinazolinone 12) as a more potent M1 mAChR PAM with a structural ancestry originating from BQCA and related compounds. In the current study, we optimized the synthesis of and fully characterized the pharmacology of benzoquinazolinone 12, finding that its improved potency derived from a 50-fold increase in allosteric site affinity as compared with BQCA, while retaining a similar level of positive cooperativity with acetylcholine. We then utilized site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modeling to validate the allosteric binding pocket we previously described for BQCA as a shared site for benzoquinazolinone 12 and provide a molecular basis for its improved activity at the M1 mAChR. This includes a key role for hydrophobic and polar interactions with residues Tyr-179, in the second extracellular loop (ECL2) and Trp-400(7.35) in transmembrane domain (TM) 7. Collectively, this study highlights how the properties of affinity and cooperativity can be differentially modified on a common structural scaffold and identifies molecular features that can be exploited to tailor the development of M1 mAChR-targeting PAMs."

https://openalex.org/W1978876698,"There is interest in understanding post-translational modifications of proteins in inflammatory disease. Neddylation is the conjugation of the molecule neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 8 (NEDD8) to promote protein stabilization. Cullins are a family of NEDD8 targets important in the stabilization and degradation of proteins, such as hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF; via Cullin-2). Here, we elucidate the role of human deneddylase-1 (DEN-1, also called SENP8) in inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo and define conditions for targeting neddylation in models of mucosal inflammation. HIF provides protection in inflammatory models, so we examined the contribution of DEN-1 to HIF stabilization. Pharmacologic targeting of neddylation activity with MLN4924 (IC50, 4.7 nM) stabilized HIF-1α, activated HIF promoter activity by 2.5-fold, and induced HIF-target genes in human epithelial cells up to 5-fold. Knockdown of DEN-1 in human intestinal epithelial cells resulted in increased kinetics in barrier formation, decreased permeability, and enhanced barrier restitution by 2 ± 0.5-fold. Parallel studies in vivo revealed that MLN4924 abrogated disease severity in murine dextran sulfate sodium colitis, including weight loss, colon length, and histologic severity. We conclude that DEN-1 is a regulator of cullin neddylation and fine-tunes the inflammatory response in vitro and in vivo. Pharmacologic inhibition of cullin neddylation may provide a therapeutic opportunity in mucosal inflammatory disease."

In this study, we investigated the role of nine highly conserved MH domain residues in the replication cycle of DENV by site-directed mutagenesis in a DENV1 prME expression construct and found that alanine substitutions introduced to four highly conserved residues at the C terminus and one at the N terminus of the MH domain greatly affect the production of both virus-like particles and replicon particles. Eight of the nine alanine mutants affected the entry of replicon particles, which correlated with the impairment in prM cleavage.

Recent studies have indicated an interplay between the SWI/SNF complex and protein-arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs). Little is known, however, about the role of SWI/SNF and PRMTs in vitamin D receptor (VDR)-mediated transcription. Using SWI/SNF-defective cells, we demonstrated that Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1), an ATPase that is a component of the SWI/SNF complex, plays a fundamental role in induction by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) of the transcription of Cyp24a1 encoding the enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 24-hydroxylase involved in the catabolism of 1,25(OH)2D3.

These coregulatory complexes include the coactivator complex DRIP (VDR-interacting protein complex also known as Mediator complex) that functions at least in part through recruitment of RNA polymerase II and the p160 coactivators (steroid receptor coactivators 1, 2, and 3), which have histone acetyltransferase activity (1Bikle D.

For transcription to occur, chromatin structure is altered not only by covalent modification of histones but also by ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzymes. One important ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor is the SWI/SNF multisubunit complex (6Euskirchen G. Auerbach R.K. Snyder M.

Each SWI/SNF complex contains one of two homologous ATPases, Brahma (Brm) or Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1).

In addition, it has been shown that ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes can act together with histone-modifying enzymes to modulate transcription (18Xu W. Cho H. Kadam S. Banayo E.M.

Transfer of an additional methyl group results in the formation of asymmetrically dimethylated arginines (catalyzed by type I enzymes) or symmetrically dimethylated arginines (catalyzed by type II enzymes). PRMT4 (CARM1), a type I PRMT, methylates arginines 2, 17, and 26 of histone 3 and is associated with transcriptional activation, whereas PRMT5, a type II PRMT, has been linked to gene silencing through repressive histone marks including symmetrical dimethylation of H3R8 and H4R3 (21Lee D.Y.

One of the most pronounced effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 is increased synthesis of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1), the enzyme that accelerates the catabolism of 1,25(OH)2D3 (25St-Arnaud R. Feldman D. Pike J.W. Adams J.S. 3rd Ed. Vitamin D. Academic Press, New York2011: 43-56Google Scholar). Thus, by inducing CYP24A1, 1,25(OH)2D3 regulates its own synthesis, protecting against hypercalcemia. We reported previously that C/EBPβ is induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 in kidney and osteoblastic cells and is a potent enhancer of VDR-mediated Cyp24a1 transcription (26Dhawan P. Peng X. Sutton A.L. MacDonald P.N. Croniger C.M. Trautwein C. Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Christakos S.

Biol. 2005; 25: 472-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that the SWI/SNF complex contributes to transcriptional activation by VDR. We found that BRG1 associates with C/EBPβ, and together they cooperate with VDR in the regulation of Cyp24a1. PRMT5, which interacts with BRG1, was found to be a negative regulator of 1,25(OH)2D3-induced Cyp24a1 transcription and mRNA expression. Our findings provide new insight into key factors and epigenetic events that regulate Cyp24a1 expression and thus affect the regulation of 1,25(OH)2D3 metabolism and the maintenance of calcium homeostasis. Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system were obtained from Bio-Rad. C/EBPβ antiserum (C-19), BRG1 antiserum (H-88), PRMT5 antiserum (A-11), and β-actin antiserum were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Mouse distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and mouse proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) cells were provided by Dr. P. Friedman (University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine). COS-7, SW-13, and C33A cells were cultured in DMEM (Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% antibiotic mixture (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin; Invitrogen). UMR, DCT, and PCT cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin or 1% Geneticin, respectively. MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin.

Cells in each well were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine the involvement of the SWI/SNF complex, SWI/SNF-negative cells lines (SW-13 and C33A) were transfected with a component of the SWI/SNF complex, either BRG1 or Brm. COS-7 cells, which do not contain steroid receptors (including VDR), were used in transfection studies to assess the impact of VDR (using transfected VDR) on gene activation. Empty vectors were used to keep the total DNA concentration the same. 1,25(OH)2D3 (10−8 m) was added to cells in media supplemented with 2% charcoal-dextran-treated FBS 16 h post-transfection for another 24 h. Cells were harvested using 1× passive lysis buffer (Dual Luciferase reporter assay kit from Promega (Madison, WI)), and the assay for luciferase activity was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The efficiency of transfection was assessed by green fluorescent protein and PRMT5 co-transfection followed by visualization using a fluorescence microscope. The efficiency of transfection of MC3T3 and Caco-2 cells was estimated at 60–70% and was comparable with transfection efficiency in UMR cells (65–75%). For studies using promoter constructs linked to the CAT reporter gene, CAT assays were performed by standard protocols on cell extracts normalized to total protein. CAT activity was quantified by scanning TLC plates using the Packard Constant Imager System (Packard Instrument Co.). For RT-PCR analysis, total RNA was extracted from cells using Ribozol from Amresco (Solon, OH). 2 μg of total RNA was used to make cDNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For each primer set, PCR cycle numbers were chosen so that the amplification was in the linear range of amplification efficiency. Primers and annealing temperatures were as follows: Cyp24a1: forward, 5′-GTGCGGATTTCCTTTGTGAT-3′; reverse, 5′-ATTGTCTTCGCTAGAGCCCA-3′; Ta = 50 °C; TRPV6: forward, 5′-ACTGTCATTGGGGCTATCATC-3′; reverse, 5′-CAGCAGAATCGCATCAGGTC-3′; Ta = 60 °C; GAPDH: forward, 5′-TCACCATCTTCCAGGAGCG-3′; reverse, 5′-CTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGA-3′; Ta = 60 °C; osteopontin (Opn): forward, 5′-CTTTCACTCCAATCGTCCCTA-3′; reverse, 5′-GCTCTCTTTGGAATGCTCAAGT-3′; Ta = 50 °C; Prmt5: forward, 5′-CTGGATGGAGCCCAGCAC-3′; reverse, 5′-GGCTCGGACCTCATTGTACA-3′; Ta = 52 °C. For Western blotting, total cellular protein was prepared using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method. 100 μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane using a semidry transfer apparatus. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody (1:500) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% nonfat milk. The membrane was washed with PBS and incubated for 2 h with the corresponding secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting system was used to detect the antigen-antibody complex. The same blot was stripped and reprobed with β-actin polyclonal antibody to normalize for sample variation. Nuclear extracts were prepared, and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (29Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216033) Google Scholar). 500 μg–1 mg of each preparation was used for immunoprecipitation with the addition of 4 μg of C/EBPβ, BRG1, or PRMT5 antiserum for 24 h at 4 °C. 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) was added to each sample, and after further incubation by rotating at 4 °C for 24 h, the immunoprecipitated complex was collected by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min and washed with ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitor. The complex was separated by 7.5 or 15% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using BRG1 antibody, C/EBPβ antibody, or PRMT5 antibody. Cells were treated with either vehicle or 10−8 m 1,25(OH)2D3 for 4 h followed by cross-linking with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (30Dhawan P. Christakos S.

Cell. Biochem. 2010; 110: 1314-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). DNA fragments were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and subjected to PCR using primers designed to amplify fragments of the Cyp24a1 promoter C/EBP motif at −395/−388 (forward, 5′-GAAATTCTGCAAACCGCATT-3′; reverse, 5′-CCAGACTTCCCTTGGATGAA-3′). PCR using the primers to amplify the upstream region of the Cyp24a1 promoter (−837/−567) was used as a negative control. PCR analysis was carried out in the linear range of DNA amplification. PCR products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel and visualized using ethidium bromide staining. DNA acquired prior to precipitation was collected and used as the input. 10% of input was used for PCR evaluation. In re-chromatin immunoprecipitation (re-ChIP) experiments, complexes were eluted by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in 60 μl of elution buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. The eluted samples were diluted 50 times with ChIP dilution buffer and subjected again to the ChIP procedure with specific antibodies. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E., and significance was determined by analysis with Student's t test for two group comparison or analysis of variance for multiple group comparison. Previous studies have shown that VDR-induced transcription is mediated by 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent recruitment of coregulatory complexes, which include p160 coactivators with histone acetyltransferase activity (1Bikle D.

For chromatin remodeling to occur, the effects of acetylation are complemented by structural modifications that are ATP-dependent (19Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cooperation between complexes that regulate chromatin structure and transcription.Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). An important ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor is the SWI/SNF complex (6Euskirchen G. Auerbach R.K. Snyder M.

Induction of Cyp24a1 transcription is one of the most pronounced effects of 1,25(OH)2D3. To determine whether SWI/SNF activity contributes to VDR-mediated Cyp24a1 transcription, we examined the BRG1- and Brm-deficient cell line SW-13. SW-13 cells were co-transfected with VDR and the rat Cyp24a1 promoter (−1367/+74). In the absence of BRG1 and Brm but under conditions of VDR overexpression, minimal activation of Cyp24a1 transcription by 1,25(OH)2D3 was observed (Fig. 1A). However, VDR-mediated activation of Cyp24a1 transcription in SW-13 cells was preferentially enhanced by BRG1 (Fig. 1A) compared with Brm (no significant induction compared with 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment of SW-13 cells at 0.1 and 0.3 μg of Brm (data not shown)). A similar low level of induction of Cyp24a1 transcription by 1,25(OH)2D3 and preferential enhancement by BRG1 were observed using the SWI/SNF-defective cell line C33A (Fig. 1A, inset). BRG1-DN (K798R), which has a mutation in the ATPase domain and is incapable of remodeling chromatin, was found to inhibit enhancement of Cyp24a1 transcription by BRG1 in SW-13 cells (Fig. 1A). BRG1-DN also inhibited 1,25(OH)2D3 induction of Cyp24a1 transcription in SWI/SNF-competent COS-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in a maximum inhibition of 2.8 ± 0.3-fold at a concentration of 0.3 μg of BRG1-DN (p < 0.05 compared with 1,25(OH)2D3 induction in the absence of BRG1-DN) (Fig. 1B). There was no effect of BRG1-DN on basal levels of Cyp24a1 transcription (Fig. 1B). In additional studies in COS-7 cells, suboptimal 1,25(OH)2D3 Cyp24a1 transcription was significantly enhanced by BRG1 (2.3 ± 0.3-fold at a concentration of 0.1 μg of BRG1; p < 0.05 compared with 1,25(OH)2D3 induction in the absence of BRG1). Together these results indicate that BRG1 contributes to VDR-mediated transcriptional activation of Cyp24a1. Previous studies from our laboratory showed that C/EBPβ is induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 in kidney and osteoblastic cells and is a potent enhancer of VDR-mediated Cyp24a1 transcription (26Dhawan P. Peng X.

https://openalex.org/W2053189341,"SV2A is a synaptic vesicle membrane protein expressed in neurons and endocrine cells and involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. Although the exact function of SV2A still remains elusive, it was identified as the specific binding site for levetiracetam, a second generation antiepileptic drug. Our sequence analysis demonstrates that SV2A has significant homology with several yeast transport proteins belonging to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS). Many of these transporters are involved in sugar transport into yeast cells. Here we present evidence showing, for the first time, that SV2A is a galactose transporter. We expressed human SV2A in hexose transport-deficient EBY.VW4000 yeast cells and demonstrated that these cells are able to grow on galactose-containing medium but not on other fermentable carbon sources. Furthermore, the addition of the SV2A-binding antiepileptic drug levetiracetam to the medium inhibited the galactose-dependent growth of hexose transport-deficient EBY.VW4000 yeast cells expressing human SV2A. Most importantly, direct measurement of galactose uptake in the same strain verified that SV2A is able to transport extracellular galactose inside the cells. The newly identified galactose transport capability of SV2A may have an important role in regulating/modulating synaptic function.

https://openalex.org/W2088671967,"Although the mechanisms for fibrosis development remain largely unknown, recent evidence indicates that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) may act as an important fibrotic stimulus in diseased lungs. ER stress is observed in lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In this study we evaluated if ER stress and the UPR was present in macrophages exposed to chrysotile asbestos and if ER stress in macrophages was associated with asbestos-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Macrophages exposed to chrysotile had elevated transcript levels of several ER stress genes. Macrophages loaded with the Ca(2+)-sensitive dye Fura2-AM showed that cytosolic Ca(2+) increased significantly within minutes after chrysotile exposure and remained elevated for a prolonged time. Chrysotile-induced increases in cytosolic Ca(2+) were partially inhibited by either anisomycin, an inhibitor of passive Ca(2+) leak from the ER, or 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxyl)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA-AM), an intracellular Ca(2+) chelator known to deplete ER Ca(2+) stores. Anisomycin inhibited X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA splicing and reduced immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP) levels, whereas BAPTA-AM increased XBP1 splicing and BiP expression, suggesting that ER calcium depletion may be one factor contributing to ER stress in cells exposed to chrysotile. To evaluate ER stress in vivo, asbestos-exposed mice showed fibrosis development, and alveolar macrophages from fibrotic mice showed increased expression of BiP. Bronchoalveolar macrophages from asbestosis patients showed increased expression of several ER stress genes compared with normal subjects. These findings suggest that alveolar macrophages undergo ER stress, which is associated with fibrosis development."
https://openalex.org/W1978646961,"Tissue repair/wound healing, in which angiogenesis plays an important role, is a critical step in many diseases including chronic wound, myocardial infarction, stroke, cancer, and inflammation. Recently, we were the first to report that orphan nuclear receptor TR3/Nur77 is a critical mediator of angiogenesis and its associated microvessel permeability. Tumor growth and angiogenesis induced by VEGF-A, histamine, and serotonin are almost completely inhibited in Nur77 knockout mice. However, it is not known whether TR3/Nur77 plays any roles in wound healing. In these studies, skin wound-healing assay was performed in 3 types of genetically modified mice having various Nur77 activities. We found that ectopic induction of Nur77 in endothelial cells of mice is sufficient to improve skin wound healing. Although skin wound healing in Nur77 knockout mice is comparable to the wild-type control mice, the process is significantly delayed in the EC-Nur77-DN mice, in which a dominant negative Nur77 mutant is inducibly and specifically expressed in mouse endothelial cells. By a loss-of-function assay, we elucidate a novel feed-forward signaling pathway, integrin β4 → PI3K → Akt → FAK, by which TR3 mediates HUVEC migration. Furthermore, TR3/Nur77 regulates the expression of integrin β4 by targeting its promoter activity. In conclusion, expression of TR3/Nur77 improves wound healing by targeting integrin β4. TR3/Nur77 is a potential candidate for proangiogenic therapy. The results further suggest that TR3/Nur77 is required for pathologic angiogenesis but not for developmental/physiologic angiogenesis and that Nur77 and its family members play a redundant role in normal skin wound healing.-Niu, G., Ye, T., Qin, L., Bourbon, P.

https://openalex.org/W2011682602,"The most common glycosylation disorder is caused by mutations in the gene encoding phosphomannomutase2, producing a disease still without a cure. Phosphomannomutase2, a homodimer in which each chain is composed of two domains, requires a bisphosphate sugar (either mannose or glucose) as activator, opening a possible drug design path for therapeutic purposes. The crystal structure of human phosphomannomutase2, however, lacks bound substrate and a key active site loop. To speed up drug discovery, we present here the first structural model of a bisphosphate substrate bound to human phosphomannomutase2. Taking advantage of recent developments in all-atom simulation techniques in combination with limited and site-directed proteolysis, we demonstrated that α-glucose 1,6-bisphosphate can adopt two low energy orientations as required for catalysis. Upon ligand binding, the two domains come close, making the protein more compact, in analogy to the enzyme in the crystals from Leishmania mexicana. Moreover, proteolysis was also carried out on two common mutants, R141H and F119L. It was an unexpected finding that the mutant most frequently found in patients, R141H, although inactive, does bind α-glucose 1,6-bisphosphate and changes conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2087980392,"Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that is highly expressed in neurons. A possible role for UCH-L1 in neurodegeneration has been highlighted because of its presence in Lewy bodies associated with Parkinson disease and neurofibrillary tangles observed in Alzheimer disease. UCH-L1 exists in two forms in neurons, a soluble cytoplasmic form (UCH-L1(C)) and a membrane-associated form (UCH-L1(M)). Alzheimer brains show reduced levels of soluble UCH-L1(C) correlating with the formation of UCH-L1-immunoreactive tau tangles, whereas UCH-L1(M) has been implicated in α-synuclein dysfunction. Given these reports of divergent roles, we investigated the properties of UCH-L1 membrane association. Surprisingly, our results indicate that UCH-L1 does not partition to the membrane in the cultured cell lines we tested. Furthermore, in primary cultured neurons, a proportion of UCH-L1(M) does partition to the membrane, but, contrary to a previous report, this does not require farnesylation. Deletion of the four C-terminal residues caused the loss of protein solubility, abrogation of substrate binding, increased cell death, and an abnormal intracellular distribution, consistent with protein dysfunction and aggregation. These data indicate that UCH-L1 is differently processed in neurons compared with clonal cell lines and that farnesylation does not account for the membrane association in neurons."

In both structures discontinuous electron density for the 99-loop indicates that this loop is largely disordered. We provide evidence that the 99-loop is responsible for two biochemical peculiarities of KLK2, i.e. reversible inhibition by micromolar Zn2+ concentrations and permanent inactivation by autocatalytic cleavage. Indeed, several 99-loop mutants of KLK2 displayed an altered susceptibility to Zn2+, which located the Zn2+ binding site at the 99-loop/active site interface. In addition, we identified an autolysis site between residues 95e and 95f in the 99-loop, whose elimination prevented the mature enzyme from limited autolysis and irreversible inactivation. An exhaustive comparison of KLK2 with related structures revealed that in the KLK family the 99-, 148-, and 220-loop exist in open and closed conformations, allowing or preventing substrate access, which extends the concept of conformational selection in trypsin-related proteases.

The first member of this family (KLK1) was described almost a century ago (1Frey E.K. Kraut H. Über einen von der Niere ausgeschiedenen, die Herztätigkeit anregenden Stoff.Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol.

Together with KLK3 (prostate-specific antigen), whose discovery dates back to the 1960s (3Rao A.R. Motiwala H.G. Karim O.M. The discovery of prostate-specific antigen.BJU Int. 2008; 101: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and KLK2, whose corresponding gene was isolated in the 1980s (4Schedlich L.J. Bennetts B.H. Morris B.J. Primary structure of a human glandular kallikrein gene.DNA. 1987; 6: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), KLK1 belongs to the classical kallikrein subfamily. These proteases are more closely related to each other than to the new kallikreins 4–15 (called “new” because their gradual assignment to the KLK family started at the end of the 1990s (5Nelson P.S.

KLK2, which was formerly called hK2 or human glandular kallikrein 1 (Uniprot identifier P20191, MEROPS entry S01.161), is relatively restricted to prostatic tissue and seminal fluid in healthy individuals (8Shaw J.L. Diamandis E.P. Distribution of 15 human kallikreins in tissues and biological fluids.Clin. Chem. 2007; 53: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Current knowledge pinpoints the main physiological role of KLK2 to sperm liquefaction. On the one hand, KLK2 may activate the zymogen form of KLK3 (9Lövgren J. Rajakoski K. Karp M. Lundwall â.

Activation of latent protease function of pro-hK2, but not pro-PSA, involves autoprocessing.Prostate. 2001; 48: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). KLK3 in turn dissolves the sperm coagulum via degradation of semenogelins 1 and 2 and fibronectin (12McGee R.S. Herr J.C. Human seminal vesicle-specific antigen is a substrate for prostate-specific antigen (or P-30).Biol. Reprod. 1988; 39: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). On the other hand, KLK2 itself is able to cleave the latter proteins at sites distinct from KLK3 (13Lövgren J. Airas K. Lilja H. Enzymatic action of human glandular kallikrein 2 (hK2). Substrate specificity and regulation by Zn2+ and extracellular protease inhibitors.Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Maximum KLK2 activity in sperm appears immediately after ejaculation, and it decreases within 10 min due to complex formation with PCI. Because the time course of semenogelin/fibronectin degradation and loss of KLK2 in vivo activity coincide, it is assumed that KLK2 complements KLK3 during sperm liquefaction (14Deperthes D. Frenette G. Brillard-Bourdet M. Bourgeois L. Gauthier F. Tremblay R.R. Dubé J.Y. Potential involvement of kallikrein hK2 in the hydrolysis of the human seminal vesicle proteins after ejaculation.J. Androl. 1996; 17: 659-665PubMed Google Scholar). However, KLK2 is aberrantly expressed in a range of human malignancies (15Kontos C.K. Scorilas A. Kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs): a gene family of novel cancer biomarkers.Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2012; 50: 1877-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Hence, elevated KLK2 levels in blood may constitute a valid marker for prostate cancer either alone or in combination with levels of various KLK3 isoforms (16Jansen F.H. Roobol M. Jenster G.

Due to its narrow tissue distribution, KLK2 has been regarded as a potential drug target in prostate cancer (17Hekim C. Leinonen J. Närvänen A. Koistinen H. Zhu L. Koivunen E. Väisänen V.

In prostate carcinoma, KLK2 may promote growth or metastasis of tumor cells by interacting with the urokinase-type plasminogen activator system. KLK2 is able to activate the zymogen form of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (19Frenette G. Tremblay R.R. Lazure C. Dube J.Y.

To close this knowledge gap within the classical kallikreins, we present here two crystal structures of KLK2 obtained from Escherichia coli expression and refolding. Furthermore, we characterized a series of KLK2 mutants to elucidate its Zn2+ inhibition and inactivation by proteolytic cleavage within the 99-loop. Kinetic properties of these mutants extend an in-depth comparison of KLK2 with related structures and investigate the diverse roles of the 99-loop in the regulation of KLK2 activity. First, KLK2 expression vectors were prepared from prostate adenoma cDNA by inserting the sequence of the mature protease (Ile-16 to Pro-245a) between the BamHI and HindIII sites of the pQE-30 plasmid (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Hence, the resulting plasmid pQE-30-pro(DDDDK)_KLK2 encoded an N-terminal artificial propeptide (MRGSHHHHHHGSDDDDK) with a hexahistidine tag preceding the canonical enterokinase (EK) recognition sequence (DDDDK). Second, round-the-horn site-directed mutagenesis 3S. Moore, unpublished data. was employed to generate two vectors with alternative cleavage sites in the propeptide: pQE-30-pro(SGDR)_KLK2 and pQE-30-pro(PSFR)_KLK2. Third, we generated six point mutants from these three pQE-30 derivatives by round-the-horn site-directed mutagenesis: H25A, H91A, K95eM, K95eQ, H95fA, H101A. DNA sequencing confirmed the correctness of all constructs. Enzymes for cloning were purchased from Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA) or Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). KLK2 was expressed as inclusion bodies and folded in vitro essentially as described for the catalytic domain of EK (28Skala W. Goettig P. Brandstetter H. Do-it-yourself histidine-tagged bovine enterokinase: a handy member of the protein engineer's toolbox.J. Biotechnol. 2013; 168: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In brief, E. coli M15[pREP4] cells (Qiagen) were transformed with the respective expression plasmid and grown in LB medium (supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml kanamycin) until the culture reached an A600 of 1.2. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were disrupted by sonication, and insoluble matter was washed with Triton X-100- and EDTA-containing buffers. Washed inclusion bodies were solubilized 1:20 (w/v) in 7.5 m guanidine-HCl, pH 9, 50 mm Tris, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 24 h, dialyzed against 5 mm citrate, pH 3.5–4.0, and resolubilized 1:10 (w/v) in 7.5 m guanidine-HCl, pH 4.0–4.5, 50 mm Tris for several hours. Dropwise dilution of this solution into the 100-fold volume of 500 mm arginine, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm cysteine-HCl, and 0.5 mm cystine yielded 5–10% folded protein after 3 days at 16 °C. Wild type KLK2 and the mutants K95eM, K95eQ, and H101A were purified by (negative) ion exchange chromatography (IEC) and benzamidine (BEN) affinity chromatography (BENAC); purification of the mutants H25A, H91A, and H95fA comprised (positive) IEC, activation by EK, negative metal ion affinity chromatography, and BENAC (Fig. 1). Chromatography resins were obtained from GE Healthcare. After tangential flow concentration, the refolding solution was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated in IEC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The ratio of load to resin was about 50:1 (v/v) in this and all following affinity chromatography steps; all buffers contained 3 mm sodium azide. In negative IEC, the flow-through contained mature KLK2. In positive IEC, pro-KLK2 was eluted from the column with 3 resin volumes of IEC buffer supplemented with 150 mm NaCl. Zymogen forms of KLK2 from positive IEC were incubated with EK in a molar ratio of 1000:1 for 15 h at 20 °C. EK was produced in-house as previously described (28Skala W. Goettig P. Brandstetter H.

The digestion mixture was brought to 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole and loaded onto a Ni2+- or Co2+-Sepharose column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole. The flow-through contained mature KLK2, whereas the resin-bound residual pro-KLK2 cleaved propeptide and EK. For BENAC, flow-through from negative IEC was brought to 500 mm NaCl and loaded onto a benzamidine-Sepharose column equilibrated in BENAC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl). Flow-through from metal ion affinity chromatography was directly loaded due to its proper sodium chloride concentration. After washing with 8 resin volumes of BENAC buffer, bound KLK2 was eluted with 3 × 2.5 resin volumes of BENAC buffer supplemented with 25, 50, and 100 mm benzamidine. As final polishing step, size exclusion chromatography was performed over a Superose 6 10/300 GL column connected to an ÄKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare). To this end, the BENAC eluate was concentrated in Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units, molecular weight cutoff 10 kDa (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Per run, 500 μl of concentrate were loaded onto the column at 4 °C (running buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm benzamidine). Fractions that corresponded to the monomeric KLK2 peak were combined and concentrated to 12 mg/ml. Chemicals of the highest purity available were either from AppliChem (Darmstadt, Germany), Carl Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany), Merck, or Sigma. Bz-PFR-pNA, H-GHR-AMC, H-PFR-AMC, H-Arg-AMC, and PPACK were obtained from Bachem (Weil am Rhein, Germany). Amidolytic activity was generally measured in 100 μl of assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) DMSO, 0.1% (w/v) BSA) containing 400 ng (150 nm) of KLK2 and 250 μm chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate. pH values of the reaction mixtures were routinely checked to exclude any effects of pH changes. Time-dependent substrate cleavage corresponded to changes in absorbance at 405 nm (for pNA substrates) or fluorescence at 460 nm (for AMC substrates; excitation wavelength: 380 nm) and was recorded on an Infinite M200 microplate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using computed extinction coefficients and molecular weights. For calculating kcat values, we performed active site titration of the respective KLK2 variant with PPACK and corrected the data accordingly. The pH optimum was determined in 100 mm SPG buffer (12.5 mm succinate, 43.75 mm NaH2PO4, 43.75 mm glycine). Zn2+ inhibition curves were measured without BSA, as its metal binding sites sequestered Zn2+ ions from the reaction buffer. However, KLK2 adsorbed to the microplate walls in the absence of BSA, which interfered with the measurement of Michaelis-Menten kinetics at different Zn2+ concentrations. Thus, we saturated all Zn2+ binding sites in BSA by dialyzing BSA-containing assay buffer against the 200-fold volume of assay buffer with the desired Zn2+ concentration. Reactivity toward the burst reagent 4-nitrophenyl-4-guanidinobenzoate (NPGB) (29Chase Jr., T. Shaw E. Comparison of the esterase activities of trypsin, plasmin, and thrombin on guanidinobenzoate esters: titration of the enzymes.Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2212-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) was determined by adding 75 μl of 100 μm KLK2 to 675 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μm NPGB and by detecting the concomitant change in absorbance at 405 nm. Substrate specificity was determined by positional scanning as previously described (30Choe Y. Leonetti F. Greenbaum D.C. Lecaille F. Bogyo M. Brömme D. Ellman J.A. Craik C.S.

Crystals of active wild type KLK2 were grown at 20 °C by vapor diffusion in 500 nl of sitting drops of a 12 mg/ml protein solution in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm benzamidine, 3 mm NaN3 that were mixed with 500 nl of precipitant. Crystals of benzamidine-inhibited KLK2 appeared within 10 days in 500 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1 m Li2SO4, 100 mm sodium citrate and were directly frozen in the nitrogen gas stream (100 K) without prior cryoprotection. Crystals of the KLK2-PPACK complex were obtained by soaking KLK2-benzamidine crystals for 1 h in mother liquor supplemented with 7 mm PPACK. Data sets were collected in-house (Bruker AXS microstar rotating anode, mar345 image plate) or at the beamline X12 (MarMosaic 225 charge-coupled device) at the DESY in Hamburg (see Table 1).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics for KLK2StructureKLK2-BENKLK2-PPACKPDB ID4nfe4nffData collectionWavelength (Å)1.54180.97004Space groupP212121P212121Cell constants (Å)a = 59.65, b = 60.39, c = 67.68a = 60.10, b = 60.74, c = 66.80α = β = γ = 90°α = β = γ = 90°Resolution rangeaValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.

https://openalex.org/W2058751269,"Munc18-1 plays essential dual roles in exocytosis: (i) stabilizing and trafficking the central SNARE protein, syntaxin-1 (i.e. chaperoning function), by its domain-1; and (ii) priming/stimulating exocytosis by its domain-3a. Here, we examine whether or not domain-3a also plays a significant role in the chaperoning of syntaxin-1 and, if so, how these dual functions of domain-3a are regulated. We demonstrate that introduction of quintuple mutations (K332E/K333E/P335A/Q336A/Y337L) in domain-3a of Munc18-1 abolishes its ability to bind syntaxin-1 and fails to rescue the level and trafficking of syntaxin-1 as well as to restore exocytosis in Munc18-1/2 double knockdown cells. By contrast, a quadruple mutant (K332E/K333E/Q336A/Y337L) sparing the Pro-335 residue retains all of these capabilities. A single point mutant of P335A reduces the ability to bind syntaxin-1 and rescue syntaxin-1 levels. Nonetheless, it surprisingly outperforms the wild type in the rescue of exocytosis. However, when additional mutations in the neighboring residues are combined with P335A mutation (K332E/K333E/P335A, P335A/Q336A/Y337L), the ability of the Munc18-1 variants to chaperone syntaxin-1 and to rescue exocytosis is strongly impaired. Our results indicate that residues from Lys-332 to Tyr-337 of domain-3a are intimately tied to the chaperoning function of Munc18-1. We also propose that Pro-335 plays a pivotal role in regulating the balance between the dual functions of domain-3a. The hinged conformation of the α-helix containing Pro-335 promotes the syntaxin-1 chaperoning function, whereas the P335A mutation promotes its priming function by facilitating the α-helix to adopt an extended conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1999446842,"Retinoid X receptor (RXRα) is activated by 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA) and regulates transcription as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with other nuclear receptors. We have previously demonstrated that β-apo-13-carotenone, an eccentric cleavage product of β-carotene, antagonizes the activation of RXRα by 9cRA in mammalian cells overexpressing this receptor. However, the molecular mechanism of β-apo-13-carotenone's modulation on the transcriptional activity of RXRα is not understood and is the subject of this report. We performed transactivation assays using full-length RXRα and reporter gene constructs (RXRE-Luc) transfected into COS-7 cells, and luciferase activity was examined. β-Apo-13-carotenone was compared with the RXRα antagonist UVI3003. The results showed that both β-apo-13-carotenone and UVI3003 shifted the dose-dependent RXRα activation by 9cRA. In contrast, the results of assays using a hybrid Gal4-DBD:RXRαLBD receptor reporter cell assay that detects 9cRA-induced coactivator binding to the ligand binding domain demonstrated that UVI3003 significantly inhibited 9cRA-induced coactivator binding to RXRαLBD, but β-apo-13-carotenone did not. However, both β-apo-13-carotenone and UVI3003 inhibited 9-cRA induction of caspase 9 gene expression in the mammary carcinoma cell line MCF-7. To resolve this apparent contradiction, we investigated the effect of β-apo-13-carotenone on the oligomeric state of purified recombinant RXRαLBD. β-Apo-13-carotenone induces tetramerization of the RXRαLBD, although UVI3003 had no effect on the oligomeric state. These observations suggest that β-apo-13-carotenone regulates RXRα transcriptional activity by inducing the formation of the “transcriptionally silent” RXRα tetramer.

RXRs are primarily made up of two modular domains as follows: a central DNA binding domain (DBD) and a carboxyl-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD). In addition to its role in binding of ligands, the LBD contains dimerization motifs and an activation function 2 (AF-2) domain (13Dawson M.I. Xia Z. The retinoid X receptors and their ligands.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1821: 21-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 14de Lera A.R. Bourguet W. Altucci L. Gronemeyer H. Design of selective nuclear receptor modulators: RAR and RXR as a case study.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Ligand-free RXR represses transcription of target genes through interaction with corepressor proteins. Ligand binding induces a conformational change of the AF-2 helix that releases corepressor protein and allows recruiting of coactivator complexes. Numerous compounds synthesized as antagonists, such as UVI3003, target the AF-2 helix (13Dawson M.I. Xia Z. The retinoid X receptors and their ligands.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1821: 21-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Ligand-free RXR tends to associate into homotetramers both in solution and when bound to DNA. However, RXR tetramers rapidly dissociate into active dimers upon binding of an agonist such as 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA). RXR heterodimers bind in regulatory regions of their target genes by associating with response elements. RXR homodimers bind to a retinoid DNA-response element (RXRE). Activation of DNA-bound dimers by ligands promotes the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators to the promoters of target genes and enhances transcription rate. In vitro studies have indicated that full-length RXR self-associates into tetramers, and the LBD alone is sufficient to mediate tetramer formation with 3–5 nm affinity between the dimers (12Kersten S. Kelleher D. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Retinoid X receptor α forms tetramers in solution.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 8645-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 15Kersten S.

Dietary provitamin A, β-carotene, can be metabolized in mammals through two pathways (22Harrison E.H. Mechanisms of digestion and absorption of dietary vitamin A.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2005; 25: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). β-Carotene oxygenase 1 (BCO1) catalyzes the cleavage of the 15,15′ double bond resulting in two retinaldehyde molecules, and the eccentric cleavage takes place at double bonds other than the central 15,15′ double bond to produce β-apocarotenoids with different chain lengths. β-Apocarotenoids have been detected in foods (23Fleshman M.K.

Our previous studies demonstrated that β-apo-13-carotenone functioned as an antagonist in transactivation assays using full-length RXRα (26Eroglu A. Hruszkewycz D.P. Curley Jr., R.W. Harrison E.H.

We have reported that β-apo-13-carotenone competes for 9cRA binding to RXRα with an affinity (7–8 nm) identical to 9cRA itself (27Eroglu A. Hruszkewycz D.P. dela Sena C. Narayanasamy S. Riedl K.M.

However, the molecular mechanism of β-apo-13-carotenone's modulation of transcriptional activity is not understood yet. This study focused on the mechanism by which β-apo-13-carotenone antagonizes 9cRA-induced activation of RXRα. Our results show that β-apo-13-carotenone induces formation of the RXRα transcriptionally silent tetramer but does not inhibit coactivator recruitment to the isolated LBD. COS-7 African green monkey kidney cells and MCF-7 ((Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (a human mammary cancer cell line)) mammary carcinoma cells from ATCC (Rockville, MD) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were maintained at 37 °C with 10% CO2. 9-cis-Retinoic acid and UVI3003 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. β-Apo-13-carotenone was synthesized as described previously (27Eroglu A. Hruszkewycz D.P. dela Sena C. Narayanasamy S. Riedl K.M. Kopec R.E. Schwartz S.J. Curley Jr., R.W. Harrison E.H.

COS-7 cells were cultured in 96-well plates overnight. cDNA of full-length human RXRα in pSV sport vector (Addgene) was cotransfected with Renilla (pRL-tk) and Firefly luciferase (RXRE-Luc) reporter constructs into COS-7 cells in serum-free DMEM with X-tremeGENE 9 DNA (Roche Applied Science). Twenty four hours after transfection, COS-7 cells in DMEM with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS were then treated with 9cRA in the presence or absence of β-apo-13-carotenone or UVI3003 for an additional 24 h. Cell lysates were used in the dual-luciferase assay (Promega) to determine the activation of hRXRα by 9cRA and the inhibition by β-apo-13-carotenone and UVI3003. For each experiment, the firefly luciferase (experimental reporter) activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase (control reporter). Reporter cells expressing human RXRαLBD fused to the GAL-4 DBD (Indigo Biosciences, State College PA) were treated according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reporter cells were incubated with 0, 0.32, 1.6, 8, 40, 200, 1000, and 5000 nm 9cRA for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of fixed concentrations of either β-apo-13-carotenone or UVI3003. Luminescence was detected with Glomax96 luminometer (Promega). MCF-7 breast cancer cells were cultured in 6-well plates and starved for 24 h in serum-free DMEM. MCF-7 cells were then treated with ligands in serum-free medium for 4 h. Total RNA was isolated using NucleoSpin RNA II (Macherey-Nagel). Two micrograms of RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative real time PCR analysis was performed in quadruplicate with TaqMan chemistry and probed for caspase 9 (Hs00154260-m1) (Applied Biosystems). Eukaryotic 18S rRNA (43337607) was used as a housekeeping gene. The comparative Ct method (ΔΔCt) was used to analyze results. N-His-tagged mouse RXRαLBD (pET15b) was transformed into BL21(DE3). The E. coli culture was grown at 37 °C to A600 of 0.6. After induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, cells was incubated for another 2–4 h at 25 °C. Cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 3 mm DTT, pH 8.0). The supernatant was loaded onto a HisPur Ni-NTA affinity column followed by extensive washing with 20 mm imidazole in lysis buffer. His-mRXRαLBD was eluted with 500 mm imidazole in lysis buffer. The concentrated protein peak fraction was then applied to HiLoad Superdex 200 gel filtration column for isolation of mRXRαLBD dimer and tetramer. The gel filtration column was calibrated with protein standards of 13.7, 25, 43, 67, 158, 232, and 440 kDa and blue dextran 2000 to confirm the molecular weights of the mRXRαLBD dimer and tetramer. Protein concentration was determined with the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The purity of protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Purified mRXRαLBD dimer (50 μm in monomer concentration) was incubated with β-apo-13-carotenone or UVI3003 in various concentrations on ice for 3 h or overnight. Tween 40 was added to increase ligand solubility in the aqueous buffer. In other experiments, mRXRαLBD tetramer (50 μm in monomer concentration) was first saturated with 100 μm β-apo-13-carotenone and then was incubated with 9cRA. After ligand treatment, mRXRαLBD was subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 HR column controlled by an AKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare). The running buffer contained 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, at 4 °C. Protein chromatograms were monitored at 280 nm. As above, this gel filtration column was also calibrated with proteins of known molecular weight to confirm the retention volumes of the mRXRαLBD dimers and tetramers. To investigate the effect of β-apo-13-carotenone and UVI3003 on the functional role of RXRα, an RXRE-luciferase receptor/reporter transactivation assay was performed. Full-length hRXRα was transiently cotransfected in COS-7 cells with two reporter plasmids, a firefly luciferase reporter containing RXRE from CRBP-II and Renilla luciferase as an internal control. In transfected cells, 9cRA induced luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner over a concentration range of 5 × 10−5 m (50 μm) to 3.2 × 10−10 m (0.32 nm), as shown in Fig. 1. To determine the antagonist function of β-apo-13-carotenone and UVI3003, cells were treated with 9cRA in the presence of β-apo-13-carotenone or UVI3003 at a constant concentration of 200 nm. We observed a shift in the 9cRA dose-response curve induced by both β-apo-13-carotenone and the known antagonist UVI3003. β-Apo-13-carotenone alone did not induce the activation of RXRα (data not shown). This suggests that β-apo-13-carotenone antagonizes 9cRA activation of full-length hRXRα with a similar efficiency as the known antagonist UVI3003. It was previously reported that caspase 9 is one of the direct target genes for RAR-RXR heterodimers (28Donato L.J. Noy N. Suppression of mammary carcinoma growth by retinoic acid: proapoptotic genes are targets for retinoic acid receptor and cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II signaling.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8193-8199Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 29Donato L.J. Suh J.H. Noy N. Suppression of mammary carcinoma cell growth by retinoic acid: the cell cycle control gene Btg2 is a direct target for retinoic acid receptor signaling.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 30Yasmin R. Kannan-Thulasiraman P. Kagechika H. Dawson M.I. Noy N. Inhibition of mammary carcinoma cell growth by RXR is mediated by the receptor's oligomeric switch.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 397: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, we asked whether β-apo-13-carotenone and UVI3003 would inhibit the 9cRA-induced transcription of the endogenous gene caspase 9. For these experiments, MCF-7 cells were serum-starved for 24 h and followed by incubation with 9cRA, β-apo-13-carotenone, or UVI3003 at concentrations of 200 nm for 4 h. As shown in Fig. 2, 9cRA up-regulated the expression of mRNA for caspase 9 3–4-fold. Both β-apo-13-carotenone or UVI3003 inhibited 9cRA-induced gene expression. These data support the results shown above that β-apo-13-carotenone and UVI3003 antagonize 9cRA-induced transactivation of RXRα in transactivation assays. To further characterize the mechanisms of β-apo-13-carotenone and UVI3003 as antagonists for RXRα, we used cells that stably express a fusion protein containing the Gal4-DBD linked to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of RXRα. The luciferase reporter gene utilized in these assays contains the Gal4 upstream activation sequence linked to the luciferase reporter gene. 9cRA activated the transcription; however, β-apo-13-carotenone alone did not activate the RXRα reporter assay (Fig. 3A). Although we tested cotreatment with β-apo-13-carotenone at several different concentrations (5, 10, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 nm) with 9cRA, no marked shift of the 9cRA dose-response curve was observed (Fig. 3B). In contrast, 200 or 500 nm UVI3003 prominently shifted the 9cRA dose-response curve, as shown in Fig. 3C. In this assay the activation of RXRα does not require the formation of RXRαLBD dimer. 9cRA binding to the ligand binding domain of RXRα provokes a conformational change of the AF-2 motif that produces a suitable binding surface for recruitment of coactivators. Previous structural studies have shown that the binding of antagonist UVI3003 to LBD of RXRα disturbs the conformation of helix 12 (H12) and leads to inhibition of coactivator recruitment (31Nahoum V. Pérez E. Germain P. Rodríguez-Barrios F. Manzo F. Kammerer S. Lemaire G. Hirsch O. Royer C.A. Gronemeyer H. de Lera A.R. Bourguet W. Modulators of the structural dynamics of the retinoid X receptor to reveal receptor function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17323-17328Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Strikingly, in the experiments reported here using the hybrid receptor, β-apo-13-carotenone had no effect on coactivator binding to the RXRαLBD. To further elucidate the mechanism underlying regulation of the RXRα transcriptional activity by β-apo-13-carotenone, we investigated the dimer-tetramer equilibrium of RXRαLBD after exposure to ligand. Mouse RXRαLBD was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity as shown in Fig. 4. Gel filtration chromatography on calibrated columns of Superdex 200 was used to isolate the mRXRαLBD dimer and tetramer used in the following experiments. Recombinant mouse RXRαLBD dimer 50 μm (calculated as monomer concentration) was incubated with increasing concentrations (100, 250, and 500 μm) of β-apo-13-carotenone on ice for 3 h or overnight. Gel filtration chromatography demonstrated β-apo-13-carotenone-induced formation of RXRαLBD tetramer (Fig. 5). Treatment with 500 μm β-apo-13-carotenone for 3 h, in the molar ratio to monomer receptor of 5:1, led to 33% tetramer formation of the RXRαLBD, although if treatment was extended overnight, 50% tetramer RXRαLBD formed. In contrast, the antagonist UVI3003 did not induce tetramer formation at any of the tested concentrations (Fig. 6) even if incubations were extended overnight (data not shown). Finally, β-apo-13-carotenone-saturated RXRαLBD tetramer, in molar ratio 2:1 (β-apo-13-carotenone/monomer RXRαLBD), was incubated with the agonist 9cRA. RXRαLBD tetramer dissociated to dimer with the addition of agonist 9cRA. At 50 μm, in an equal molar concentration to monomer RXRαLBD, 9cRA induced ∼55% of dimer, whereas higher concentrations of 9cRA almost completely converted tetramer to dimer (Fig. 7). The gel filtration chromatography results showed that β-apo-13-carotenone induced the tetramerization of RXRαLBD, which was reversed with addition of 9cRA. In contrast, the antagonist UVI3003 did not influence the tetramer-dimer equilibrium of RXRαLBD.FIGURE 5Gel filtration analysis for tetramerization of RXRαLBD induced by β-apo-13-carotenone. Purified mRXRαLBD dimer (50 μm in monomer concentration) was incubated with β-apo-13-carotenone in concentrations of 0, 100, 250, and 500 μm on ice for 3 h or overnight. Tween 40 of 0.75% (w/v) was added to increase ligand solubility in the aqueous buffer.

The comparison of experimental data of β-apo-13-carotenone and UVI3003 indicated that these RXRα antagonists use two distinct mechanisms. β-Apo-13-carotenone, a naturally occurring β-apocarotenoid that can be obtained from either the diet directly or from eccentric cleavage of β-carotene functioned as an antagonist of RXRα. UVI3003 is a selective antagonist of RXRα whose inhibitory effect results from an interference of its long side chains with Leu-451 of helix-12 (31Nahoum V. Pérez E. Germain P. Rodríguez-Barrios F. Manzo F. Kammerer S. Lemaire G. Hirsch O. Royer C.A. Gronemeyer H. de Lera A.R. Bourguet W. Modulators of the structural dynamics of the retinoid X receptor to reveal receptor function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17323-17328Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Both β-apo-13-carotenone and UVI3003 inhibited 9cRA-induced transactivation of full-length RXRα in a dual-luciferase assay, whereas higher concentrations of 9cRA overcame the inhibition by the two antagonists. Both antagonists inhibited 9cRA induction of the expression of the caspase 9 gene in MCF-7 cells. The tetramerization of RXRα induced by β-apo-13-carotenone is supported by reporter cell-based assays. The “Gal4-DBD:RXRαLBD” receptor expressed in the reporter cells will bind ligand, translocate to the nucleus, bind to the Gal4 upstream activation sequence on the reporter gene, recruit co-activator proteins, and lead to the transcription of luciferase. It is important to note that the whole process of transcription in these reporter cells does not require dimerization of RXRα. The conformational change of RXRαLBD due to ligand binding is sufficient to activate coactivator recruitment and subsequent luciferase transcription. β-Apo-13-carotenone is inactive in this assay. In contrast, full-length RXRα expressed in COS-7 cells undergoes nuclear translocation, dimer formation upon agonist binding, binding to the RXRE, coactivator recruitment, and luciferase transcription. The distinctive difference in the mechanism between the reporter cell assay with Gal4-DBD:RXRαLBD and the transactivation assay with full-length RXRα is that dimer formation is obligatory for the latter; and β-apocarotenone is only effective as an antagonist in this assay. These observations suggest that β-apo-13-carotenone inhibits 9cRA-induced RXRα transcription through the formation of the RXRα tetramer. In an x-ray crystal study, atRA has been shown to bind to the transcriptionally silent tetrameric RXRα in a unique conformation (32Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Wisely G.B. Milburn M.V. Xu H.E. Structural basis for autorepression of retinoid X receptor by tetramer formation and the AF-2 helix.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed using molecular modeling that when this bound atRA is computationally removed from the tetrameric RXR protein and redocked, it assumes the identical position as in the crystal structure (26Eroglu A. Hruszkewycz D.P. Curley Jr., R.W. Harrison E.H. The eccentric cleavage product of β-carotene, β-apo-13-carotenone, functions as an antagonist of RXRα.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 504: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, when β-apo-13-carotenone is built in a similar conformation to this atRA and is docked into this RXRα tetramer, it occupies the same position and has the same conformation as the bound atRA. Alternatively, when we built β-apo-13-carotenone in a conformation similar to RXRα-bound 9cRA (33Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Crystal structure of the ligand-binding domain of the human nuclear receptor RXR-α.Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar) and attempted to dock this molecule into the dimeric RXRα, it assumes a very different position than the agonist ligand. Thus, we suggested that β-apo-13-carotenone should be capable of acting as an antagonist of RXRα by stabilizing the transcriptionally silent tetramer, but we had no direct biochemical evidence for that suggestion at that time. The crystal structure study of the ligand binding domain of the RXRα suggested that a cavity corresponded to the RXR ligand-binding site and that 9cRA binding triggered a conformational modification of helix 11, which led to ligand-dependent transactivation by AF-2 (33Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Crystal structure of the ligand-binding domain of the human nuclear receptor RXR-α.Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the tetramerization domain is located in helix 11 at the RXRαLBD and tetramerization does not interfere with the function of helix12 (34Kersten S. Reczek P.R. Noy N. The tetramerization region of the retinoid X receptor is important for transcriptional activation by the receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29759-29768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, β-apo-13-carotenone could cause tetramerization of RXRα by interacting with helix 11 and not affecting helix 12 (or coactivator binding). In contrast, inhibition of 9cRA-induced RXRα transcription by UVI3003 is due to the blockage of helix 12 as pointed out above (31Nahoum V. Pérez E. Germain P. Rodríguez-Barrios F. Manzo F. Kammerer S. Lemaire G. Hirsch O. Royer C.A. Gronemeyer H. de Lera A.R. Bourguet W. Modulators of the structural dynamics of the retinoid X receptor to reveal receptor function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17323-17328Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). RXRα tetramer formation induced by β-apo-13-carotenone was confirmed biochemically in this study by the observations of gel filtration chromatography with purified recombinant mouse RXRαLBD. Comparison between the β-apo-13-carotenone and UVI3003-treated dimeric RXRαLBD indicates that β-apo-13-carotenone regulates RXRα transcription through tetramerization, whereas inhibition by the antagonist UVI3003 is due to interference with helix 12. The complete dissociation of the tetramer RXRαLBD saturated with β-apo-13-carotenone to dimer by 9cRA shows that tetramerization is reversible when the agonist is in sufficient concentration. Thus, the equilibrium of RXRα dimer and tetramer could be controlled by the availability of ligands. A model of these various effects of ligands on RXRα is shown in Fig. 8. In summary, this study revealed the mechanism of ligand-dependent regulation of RXRα transcriptional activity by the antagonist β-apo-13-carotenone. The findings imply that tetramerization of RXR and factors that modulate the oligomer state may contribute to regulation of cellular signaling. β-Apo-13-carotenone-induced tetramerization could conserve RXRα as an inactive nuclear receptor pool that can rapidly supply dimeric or monomeric RXRα upon 9cRA generation. This may also suggest a ligand-dependent modulation controlling the availability of RXRα for the heterodimerization with other nuclear receptor partners engaged in multiple signaling pathways.

To do so, Chlamydia expresses proteins on the surface of the inclusion using a Type III secretion system.

Using a multidisciplinary approach, we have discovered the functional core of IncA that retains the ability to both inhibit SNARE-mediated fusion and promote the homotypic fusion of Chlamydia inclusions. Circular dichroism and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments show that this core region is composed almost entirely of α-helices and assembles into stable homodimers in solution.

Chlamydia infection is the most frequently reported bacterial sexually transmitted disease in the United States, with ∼1.4 million new cases reported annually (Centers for Disease Control, United States). Failure to treat infections can result in tissue scarring, infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease, and ectopic pregnancy in females as well as permanent blindness in the case of ocular infections. Despite the availability of antibiotics to treat acute infections, C. trachomatis remains a significant medical and economic burden worldwide. Members of the family Chlamydiaceae, including C. trachomatis, exhibit a characteristic two-stage developmental cycle as spore-like elementary bodies and as larger, metabolically active reticulate bodies. After internalization, elementary bodies differentiate into reticulate bodies, which proliferate inside a specialized membrane-bound compartment called an inclusion (2Subtil A. Dautry-Varsat A.

The survival of Chlamydia depends on its ability to rapidly modify the nascent inclusion in order to (i) isolate it from the canonical endolysosomal pathway that normally leads to degradation and bacterial clearance, (ii) induce inclusion-inclusion (homotypic) fusion, and (iii) generate novel fusion events with host organelles to acquire nutrients (3Wyrick P.B.

The Chlamydia trachomatis IncA protein is required for homotypic vesicle fusion.Cell Microbiol. 1999; 1: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). IncA is a ∼30-kDa transmembrane protein that contains two putative α-helical/SNARE-like domains, suggesting that this bacterial protein functionally mimics eukaryotic SNARE proteins (14Delevoye C.

Conservation of the biochemical properties of IncA from Chlamydia trachomatis and C. caviae: oligomerization of IncA mediates interaction between facing membranes.J. Biol.

SNARE protein mimicry by an intracellular bacterium.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000022Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). SNAREs are responsible for most membrane fusion events in eukaryotic cells. They are located on virtually every intracellular compartment and use specific α-helical domains (SNARE motifs) to assemble into stable multimeric complexes and catalyze the fusion of the lipid bilayers on which they reside (16Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E.

SNAREpins: minimal machinery for membrane fusion.Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). In addition to their role in membrane fusion, certain SNARE proteins (known as inhibitory SNAREs, or i-SNAREs) are capable of suppressing certain fusion events to maintain organelle homeostasis (19Varlamov O. Volchuk A. Rahimian V. Doege C.A. Paumet F. Eng W.S. Arango N. Parlati F. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. i-SNAREs: inhibitory SNAREs that fine-tune the specificity of membrane fusion.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, SNARE proteins constitute a universal membrane fusion machinery in eukaryotic cells and are prime targets for intracellular bacteria that need to establish residence inside host cells (20Wesolowski J. Paumet F. SNARE motif: A common motif used by pathogens to manipulate membrane fusion.Virulence. 2010; 1: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). IncA has been shown to play a role in the homotypic fusion of inclusions (13Hackstadt T. Scidmore-Carlson M.A. Shaw E.I. Fischer E.R. The Chlamydia trachomatis IncA protein is required for homotypic vesicle fusion.Cell Microbiol. 1999; 1: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Microinjection of anti-IncA Fab fragments into C. trachomatis-infected cells and targeted mutation of the incA gene result in the accumulation of multiple, non-fused inclusions containing otherwise viable bacteria (13Hackstadt T. Scidmore-Carlson M.A. Shaw E.I. Fischer E.R.

Site-specific, insertional inactivation of incA in Chlamydia trachomatis using a group II intron.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e83989Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that IncA is also able to inhibit SNARE-mediated membrane fusion, likely to prevent fusion between the inclusion and the endocytic compartments (22Paumet F. Wesolowski J. Garcia-Diaz A. Delevoye C. Aulner N. Shuman H. Subtil A. Rothman J. Intracellular bacteria encode inhibitory SNARE-like proteins.PLoS One. 2009; 4: 1-9Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 23Ronzone E. Paumet F. Two coiled-coil domains of Chlamydia trachomatis IncA affect membrane fusion events during infection.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e69769Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Interestingly, clinical isolates of C. trachomatis lacking IncA display smaller inclusions and are significantly less virulent than IncA-positive strains (12Suchland R.J. Rockey D.D. Bannantine J.P. Stamm W.E. Isolates of Chlamydia trachomatis that occupy nonfusogenic inclusions lack IncA, a protein localized to the inclusion membrane.Infect.

Diversity within inc genes of clinical Chlamydia trachomatis variant isolates that occupy non-fusogenic inclusions.Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2497-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In order to understand how IncA encodes both fusogenic and inhibitory functions, we previously studied the role of each SNARE-like domain contained in the protein (named SLD1 and SLD2; see diagram in Fig. 1A). We established that either SLD is capable of blocking host SNARE-mediated membrane fusion independent of the other; however, both domains are required to promote the homotypic fusion of inclusions (23Ronzone E. Paumet F. Two coiled-coil domains of Chlamydia trachomatis IncA affect membrane fusion events during infection.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e69769Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In order to define the mechanism of action of IncA, we have now identified and characterized a trypsin-resistant region of IncA (the so-called IncA-Core) that spans the entire length of SLD1 and about one-third of SLD2. Limited proteolysis and circular dichroism experiments suggest that this region is highly structured and very stable. In addition, biochemical and cellular assays demonstrate that this region encodes the dual functions of the full-length wild type protein. The physiological relevance of these data were confirmed using Chlamydia expressing inducible wild type and dominant-negative IncA as FLAG-tagged proteins. Interestingly, IncA-Core predominantly forms dimers in solution, as compared with WT-IncA, which is mostly monomeric. However, during infection, both WT and IncA-Core form oligomers. This suggests that the C-terminal peptide that is missing in IncA-Core controls the oligomeric state of IncA and that a cellular and/or bacterial factor releases this peptide during infection for IncA to become fully fusogenic. The identification of the functional core of IncA provides the basis for a more comprehensive understanding of its mechanisms of action and could aid in the development of novel therapeutics capable of interfering with its pathogenic function in vivo. Furthermore, such a structurally well defined region may be used to screen the proteomes of other intracellular bacteria, such as Salmonella typhi and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, for the presence of similar SNARE-like proteins. TABLE 1, TABLE 2 provide a summary of the primers and plasmids used in this study. The plasmid encoding the soluble C-terminal domain of IncA named ΔTMD-IncA (designated FD199) was described previously (23Ronzone E. Paumet F. Two coiled-coil domains of Chlamydia trachomatis IncA affect membrane fusion events during infection.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e69769Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding IncA-Core was constructed by PCR-amplifying the region spanning Thr87–Leu237 using primers FO515 and FO516 and FD201 (the plasmid encoding wild type full-length IncA) as template DNA. The PCR product was digested with NcoI and XhoI and ligated into pET28a (Thermo Scientific) digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was designated FD577. His6-tagged TMD-IncA-Core (residues 1–237) was PCR-amplified using primers FO160 and FO527 and FD201 as template DNA. PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI (Thermo Scientific) and ligated into pET28a. This construct was designated FD582. DsRed-TMD-IncA-Core was constructed by PCR-amplifying the region spanning Met1–Leu237 using primers FO440 and FO527 and FD201 as template DNA. PCR products were digested with EcoRI and KpnI and ligated into pDsRed-monomer-C1 (kindly provided by Dr. Peter Antinozzi, Wake Forest School of Medicine). This construct was designated FD579. FD507 and FD509 (mammalian expression plasmids for IncA WT and SLD1, respectively) were described previously (23Ronzone E. Paumet F. Two coiled-coil domains of Chlamydia trachomatis IncA affect membrane fusion events during infection.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e69769Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). pBOMB-IncA (also known as FD569) was constructed by amplifying the ORF of wild type IncA using primers FO510 and FO511. The PCR product was digested with NotI and SalI and ligated into the corresponding sites of pBOMB-tet-mCherry (26Bauler L.D. Hackstadt T. Expression and targeting of secreted proteins from Chlamydia trachomatis.J. Bacteriol. 2014; 196: 1325-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). pBOMB-SLD1 (also known as FD573) was constructed by amplifying residues 1–141 of wild type IncA using primers FO510 and FO512 and digesting and ligating as above. pBOMB-SLD2 (also known as FD576) was constructed by amplifying the ORF of IncA (mutant SLD1) using primers FO510 and FO511. FD472, described previously (23Ronzone E. Paumet F. Two coiled-coil domains of Chlamydia trachomatis IncA affect membrane fusion events during infection.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e69769Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), was used as the DNA template. The mutations in this construct are I106D, F108A, F117A, F124A, T127D, V134D, F138A, and F145A. pBOMB-TMD-IncA-Core (FD588) was constructed by amplifying residues 1–237 of wild type IncA using primers FO510 and FO538 and digested and ligated into pBOMB-tet-mCherry as described above.

Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm and induced at 16 °C overnight. After centrifugation, ΔTMD-IncA and IncA-Core bacteria pellets were then resuspended in Buffer A (200 mm NaCl, 50 mm phosphate, 10% (w/v) glycerol, pH 7.4) and purified as described (23Ronzone E. Paumet F. Two coiled-coil domains of Chlamydia trachomatis IncA affect membrane fusion events during infection.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e69769Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex preparation grade 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer A containing 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). Protein-containing fractions were collected and concentrated. ΔTMD-IncA was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. IncA-Core peaks 1 and 2 were kept at 4 °C. The purity of each protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Protein concentrations were determined by measuring the optical density at 280 nm. 10 μg of ΔTMD-IncA in Buffer A supplemented with 1 mm DTT was incubated with varying mass ratios of trypsin in a total reaction volume of 15 μl. Reactions were stopped by adding PMSF (Amresco) to a final concentration of 1 mm and protein sample buffer to a final SDS concentration of 2% (w/v) and boiling at 95 °C for 10 min. Reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 12% bisacrylamide glycine gels or commercial Tris-Tricine 10–20% acrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). Gels were revealed with Coomassie Blue staining. For N-terminal sequencing, trypsin fragments were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes using a standard transfer protocol (23Ronzone E. Paumet F. Two coiled-coil domains of Chlamydia trachomatis IncA affect membrane fusion events during infection.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e69769Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Regions of the PVDF membrane corresponding to the different fragments were excised and sent for sequencing at the Tufts University Core Facility (Boston, MA). The amino acid sequence of C. trachomatis IncA spanning Ser76–Ser273 was used as the query sequence in PHYRE2 (27Kelley L.A. Sternberg M.J. Protein structure prediction on the Web: a case study using the Phyre server.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (3553) Google Scholar). The Protein Data Bank file of the homology model was analyzed using Chimera (University of California, San Francisco). The entire amino acid sequence of C. trachomatis IncA was used as the query sequence in MARCOIL (28Delorenzi M. Speed T. An HMM model for coiled-coil domains and a comparison with PSSM-based predictions.Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The sequence was scored against the 9FAM matrix with default settings. Proteins were diluted to 10 μm in Buffer A supplemented with 1 mm DTT and analyzed in a 0.1-cm quartz cuvette (Starna) using a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter. Wavelength scans were taken between 196 and 250 nm at 20 °C in the X-Ray Crystallography and Protein Characterization Core Facility at Thomas Jefferson University. For each replicate, five accumulations were taken and averaged. At least three replicate scans for each protein were performed. Raw data were normalized to the mean residue ellipticity (Φ) for each protein using the following equations,Mean residue weight (MRW)=(molecular weight)/ (no. of residues-1)(Eq. 1) Mean residue ellipticity (Φ)=(mdeg×MRW)/ (path length×concentration)(Eq. 2) where the molecular mass is expressed in daltons, mdeg is the raw output data from the spectropolarimeter, the path length is expressed in mm, and protein concentration is expressed in mg/ml. The percentage secondary structure in each construct was calculated using the K2D3 algorithm (29Louis-Jeune C. Andrade-Navarro M.A. Perez-Iratxeta C. Prediction of protein secondary structure from circular dichroism using theoretically derived spectra.Proteins. 2011; 10.1002/prot.23188PubMed Google Scholar). ΔTMD-IncA, IncA-Core peak 1, and IncA-Core peak 2 obtained after size exclusion chromatography were diluted in Buffer A supplemented with 1 mm DTT to concentrations between 25 and 130 μm and subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation analysis using a Beckman Coulter ProteomeLab XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics and an eight-hole An-50 Ti analytical rotor. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out at 4 °C by collecting absorption scans at a fixed wavelength of 278 nm and spinning samples at four different velocities of 12,000, 18,000, 24,000, and 30,000 revolutions/min. The program SEDNTERP version 1.09 was used to correct the experimental s value to standard conditions at 20 °C in water (s20,w) and to calculate the partial specific volume of each protein, solvent density, and relative viscosity values along with the theoretical molecular mass (30Hayes, D., Laue, T., Philo, J., (1995) Sednterp: sedimentation interpretation program. University of New Hampshire, Durham, NHGoogle Scholar). Data were fit to a “species analysis” model available in the SEDPHAT program (31Schuck P. Scott D.J. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J.

Crystallogr. 2014; 70: 342-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Analysis was performed for each protein concentration separately, and the molecular masses were determined from the average obtained from the analyses of three protein concentrations. HeLa cells were cultured as described previously (23Ronzone E. Paumet F. Two coiled-coil domains of Chlamydia trachomatis IncA affect membrane fusion events during infection.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e69769Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours prior to transfection, HeLa cells were seeded into either 6-well or 10-cm tissue culture plates in complete DMEM (DMEM supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 10 μg/ml gentamicin) and grown to 80% confluence. Cells were transiently transfected in DMEM without antibiotics (DMEM supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine and 10% FBS) with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions using 0.5 μg (6-well plate) and 3 μg (10-cm dish) of DNA with a Lipofectamine/DNA ratio of 3.5:1. These conditions consistently led to an average of ∼60% transfection. Six hours after the addition of Lipofectamine-DNA complexes, cells were reseeded into 24-well plates containing coverslips (1 × 105 cells/well) or into 10-cm dishes (1.75 × 106 cells/plate) in DMEM without antibiotics and incubated for an additional 18 h before infection. For immunofluorescence experiments, each construct was reseeded in duplicate. C. trachomatis serovar L2 expressing FLAG-IncA (FD569), FLAG-SLD1 (FD573), FLAG-SLD2 (FD576), or FLAG-TMD-IncA-Core (FD588) under the control of the tetracycline promoter were generated as described (26Bauler L.D. Hackstadt T. Expression and targeting of secreted proteins from Chlamydia trachomatis.J. Bacteriol. 2014; 196: 1325-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were infected at an MOI of 10 with Chlamydia expressing different forms of FLAG-tagged IncA. 8 h postinfection, FLAG proteins were induced with 10 ng/ml anyhydrotetracycline (Tet). The cells were lysed 24 h postinfection with lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of lysate were incubated with Protein G Plus-agarose beads prebound with anti-FLAG antibody (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were thoroughly washed with lysis buffer by centrifugation and then boiled in SDS-containing buffer. The samples were then analyzed by Western blot using anti-IncA antibody as described (33Wesolowski J. Paumet F. Escherichia coli exposure inhibits exocytic SNARE-mediated membrane fusion in mast cells.Traffic. 2014; 15: 516-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were seeded onto coverslips in 24-well plates and infected with C. trachomatis serovar L2 or transformed Chlamydia strains at an MOI of 10. The infection was synchronized by centrifugation at 900 × g for 15 min at 22 °C. To induce FLAG-"
https://openalex.org/W2159438969,"A cycle of cis-to-trans isomerization of the chromophore is intrinsic to vertebrate vision where rod and cone photoreceptors mediate dim- and bright-light vision, respectively. Daylight illumination can greatly exceed the rate at which the photoproduct can be recycled back to the chromophore by the canonical visual cycle. Thus, an additional supply pathway(s) must exist to sustain cone-dependent vision. Two-photon microscopy revealed that the eyes of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) contain high levels of 11-cis-retinyl esters (11-REs) within the retinal pigment epithelium. HPLC analyses demonstrate that 11-REs are bleached by bright light and regenerated in the dark. Pharmacologic treatment with all-trans-retinylamine (Ret-NH2), a potent and specific inhibitor of the trans-to-cis reisomerization reaction of the canonical visual cycle, impeded the regeneration of 11-REs. Intervention with 11-cis-retinol restored the regeneration of 11-REs in the presence of all-trans-Ret-NH2. We used the XOPS:mCFP transgenic zebrafish line with a functional cone-only retina to directly demonstrate that this 11-RE cycle is critical to maintain vision under bright-light conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2162705558,"Formyl-peptide receptor type 2 (FPR2; also called ALX because it is the receptor for lipoxin A4) sustains a variety of biological responses relevant to the development and control of inflammation, yet the cellular regulation of this G-protein-coupled receptor remains unexplored. Here we report that, in response to peptide agonist activation, FPR2/ALX undergoes β-arrestin-mediated endocytosis followed by rapid recycling to the plasma membrane. We identify a transplantable recycling sequence that is both necessary and sufficient for efficient receptor recycling. Furthermore, removal of this C-terminal recycling sequence alters the endocytic fate of FPR2/ALX and evokes pro-apoptotic effects in response to agonist activation. This study demonstrates the importance of endocytic recycling in the anti-apoptotic properties of FPR2/ALX and identifies the molecular determinant required for modulation of this process fundamental for the control of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2049426759,"The mechanism of neurite growth is complicated, involving continuous cytoskeletal rearrangement and vesicular trafficking. Cytohesin-2 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Arf6, an Arf family molecular switch protein, controlling cell morphological changes such as neuritogenesis. Here, we show that cytohesin-2 binds to a protein with a previously unknown function, CCDC120, which contains three coiled-coil domains, and is transported along neurites in differentiating N1E-115 cells. Transfection of the small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for CCDC120 into cells inhibits neurite growth and Arf6 activation. When neurites start to extend, vesicles containing CCDC120 and cytohesin-2 are transported in an anterograde manner rather than a retrograde one. As neurites continue extension, anterograde vesicle transport decreases. CCDC120 knockdown inhibits cytohesin-2 localization into vesicles containing CCDC120 and diffuses cytohesin-2 in cytoplasmic regions, illustrating that CCDC120 determines cytohesin-2 localization in growing neurites. Reintroduction of the wild type CCDC120 construct into cells transfected with CCDC120 siRNA reverses blunted neurite growth and Arf6 activity, whereas the cytohesin-2-binding CC1 region-deficient CCDC120 construct does not. Thus, cytohesin-2 is transported along neurites by vesicles containing CCDC120, and it mediates neurite growth. These results suggest a mechanism by which guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Arf6 is transported to mediate neurite growth.

These important regulators of neuronal development function in synapse formation, axon guidance, and axon termination. In mature neurons the PHR proteins also regulate axon degeneration and regeneration. PHR proteins function, in part, through an ubiquitin ligase complex that includes the F-box protein FSN-1 in C. elegans and Fbxo45 in mammals. At present, the structure-function relationships that govern formation of this complex are poorly understood. We cloned 9 individual domains that compose the entire RPM-1 protein sequence and found a single domain centrally located in RPM-1 that is sufficient for binding to FSN-1. Deletion analysis further refined FSN-1 binding to a conserved 97-amino acid region of RPM-1. Mutagenesis identified several conserved motifs and individual amino acids that mediate this interaction. Transgenic overexpression of this recombinant peptide, which we refer to as the RPM-1·FSN-1 complex inhibitory peptide (RIP), yields similar phenotypes and enhancer effects to loss of function in fsn-1. Defects caused by transgenic RIP were suppressed by loss of function in the dlk-1 MAP3K and were alleviated by point mutations that reduce binding to FSN-1. These findings suggest that RIP specifically inhibits the interaction between RPM-1 and FSN-1 in vivo, thereby blocking formation of a functional ubiquitin ligase complex. Our results are consistent with the FSN-1 binding domain of RPM-1 recruiting FSN-1 and a target protein, such as DLK-1, whereas the RING-H2 domain of RPM-1 ubiquitinates the target.

https://openalex.org/W1965194214,"The neuropeptide FF2 (NPFF2) receptor belongs to the rhodopsin family of G protein-coupled receptors and mediates the effects of several related RFamide neuropeptides. One of the main pharmacological interests of this system resides in its ability to regulate endogenous opioid systems, making it a potential target to reduce the negative effects of chronic opioid use. Phosphorylation of intracellular residues is the most extensively studied post-translational modification regulating G protein-coupled receptor activity. However, until now, no information concerning NPFF2 receptor phosphorylation is available. In this study, we combined mass spectrometric analysis and site-directed mutagenesis to analyze for the first time the phosphorylation pattern of the NPFF2 receptor and the role of the various phosphorylation sites in receptor signaling, desensitization, and trafficking in a SH-SY5Y model cell line. We identified the major, likely GRK-dependent, phosphorylation cluster responsible for acute desensitization, 412TNST415 at the end of the C terminus of the receptor, and additional sites involved in desensitization (372TS373) and internalization (Ser395). We thus demonstrate the key role played by phosphorylation in the regulation of NPFF2 receptor activity and trafficking. Our data also provide additional evidence supporting the concept that desensitization and internalization are partially independent processes relying on distinct phosphorylation patterns.

https://openalex.org/W2127710408,"Membrane fusion at the vacuole, the lysosome equivalent in yeast, requires the HOPS tethering complex, which is recruited by the Rab7 GTPase Ypt7. HOPS provides a template for the assembly of SNAREs and thus likely confers fusion at a distinct position on vacuoles. Five of the six subunits in HOPS have a similar domain prediction with strong similarity to COPII subunits and nuclear porins. Here, we show that Vps18 indeed has a seven-bladed β-propeller as its N-terminal domain by revealing its structure at 2.14 Å. The Vps18 N-terminal domain can interact with the N-terminal part of Vps11 and also binds to lipids. Although deletion of the Vps18 N-terminal domain does not preclude HOPS assembly, as revealed by negative stain electron microscopy, the complex is instable and cannot support membrane fusion in vitro. We thus conclude that the β-propeller of Vps18 is required for HOPS stability and function and that it can serve as a starting point for further structural analyses of the HOPS tethering complex."
https://openalex.org/W1985565690,"RNA and DNA ligases catalyze the formation of a phosphodiester bond between the 5'-phosphate and 3'-hydroxyl ends of nucleic acids. In this work, we describe the ability of the thermophilic RNA ligase MthRnl from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum to recognize and modify the 3'-terminal phosphate of RNA and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). This ligase can use an RNA 3'p substrate to generate an RNA 2',3'-cyclic phosphate or convert DNA3'p to ssDNA(3')pp(5')A. An RNA ligase from the Thermus scotoductus bacteriophage TS2126 and a predicted T4 Rnl1-like protein from Thermovibrio ammonificans, TVa, were also able to adenylate ssDNA 3'p. These modifications of RNA and DNA 3'-phosphates are similar to the activities of RtcA, an RNA 3'-phosphate cyclase. The initial step involves adenylation of the enzyme by ATP, which is then transferred to either RNA 3'p or DNA 3'p to generate the adenylated intermediate. For RNA (3')pp(5')A, the third step involves attack of the adjacent 2' hydroxyl to generate the RNA 2',3'-cyclic phosphate. These steps are analogous to those in classical 5' phosphate ligation. MthRnl and TS2126 RNA ligases were not able to modify a 3'p in nicked double-stranded DNA. However, T4 DNA ligase and RtcA can use 3'-phosphorylated nicks in double-stranded DNA to produce a 3'-adenylated product. These 3'-terminal phosphate-adenylated intermediates are substrates for deadenylation by yeast 5'Deadenylase. Our findings that classic ligases can duplicate the adenylation and phosphate cyclization activity of RtcA suggests that they have an essential role in metabolism of nucleic acids with 3'-terminal phosphates."
https://openalex.org/W2021706697,"The 175-kDa myosin-11 from Nicotiana tabacum (Nt(175kDa)myosin-11) is exceptional in its mechanical activity as it is the fastest known processive actin-based motor, moving 10 times faster than the structurally related class 5 myosins. Although this ability might be essential for long-range organelle transport within larger plant cells, the kinetic features underlying the fast processive movement of Nt(175kDa)myosin-11 still remain unexplored. To address this, we generated a single-headed motor domain construct and carried out a detailed kinetic analysis. The data demonstrate that Nt(175kDa)myosin-11 is a high duty ratio motor, which remains associated with actin most of its enzymatic cycle. However, different from other processive myosins that establish a high duty ratio on the basis of a rate-limiting ADP-release step, Nt(175kDa)myosin-11 achieves a high duty ratio by a prolonged duration of the ATP-induced isomerization of the actin-bound states and ADP release kinetics, both of which in terms of the corresponding time constants approach the total ATPase cycle time. Molecular modeling predicts that variations in the charge distribution of the actin binding interface might contribute to the thermodynamic fine-tuning of the kinetics of this myosin. Our study unravels a new type of a high duty ratio motor and provides important insights into the molecular mechanism of processive movement of higher plant myosins."

Here we show that Phd also functions as a chaperone, keeping Doc in an active, correctly folded conformation. In the absence of Phd, Doc exists in a relatively expanded state that is prone to dimerization through domain swapping with its active site loop acting as hinge region. The domain-swapped dimer is not capable of arresting protein synthesis in vitro, whereas the Doc monomer is. Upon binding to Phd, Doc becomes more compact and is secured in its monomeric state with a neutralized active site."
