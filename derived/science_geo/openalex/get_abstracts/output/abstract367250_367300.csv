https://openalex.org/W2037818631,"Because nucleosomes are widely replaced by protamine in mature human sperm, the epigenetic contributions of sperm chromatin to embryo development have been considered highly limited. Here we show that the retained nucleosomes are significantly enriched at loci of developmental importance, including imprinted gene clusters, microRNA clusters, HOX gene clusters, and the promoters of stand-alone developmental transcription and signalling factors. Notably, histone modifications localize to particular developmental loci. Dimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me2) is enriched at certain developmental promoters, whereas large blocks of H3K4me3 localize to a subset of developmental promoters, regions in HOX clusters, certain noncoding RNAs, and generally to paternally expressed imprinted loci, but not paternally repressed loci. Notably, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) is significantly enriched at developmental promoters that are repressed in early embryos, including many bivalent (H3K4me3/H3K27me3) promoters in embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, developmental promoters are generally DNA hypomethylated in sperm, but acquire methylation during differentiation. Taken together, epigenetic marking in sperm is extensive, and correlated with developmental regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2071548401,"Self-renewing cell populations such as hematopoietic stem cells and memory B and T lymphocytes might be regulated by shared signaling pathways. The Wnt-beta-catenin pathway is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that promotes hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and multipotency by limiting stem cell proliferation and differentiation, but its role in the generation and maintenance of memory T cells is unknown. We found that induction of Wnt-beta-catenin signaling by inhibitors of glycogen sythase kinase-3beta or the Wnt protein family member Wnt3a arrested CD8(+) T cell development into effector cells. By blocking T cell differentiation, Wnt signaling promoted the generation of CD44(low)CD62L(high)Sca-1(high)CD122(high)Bcl-2(high) self-renewing multipotent CD8(+) memory stem cells with proliferative and antitumor capacities exceeding those of central and effector memory T cell subsets. These findings reveal a key role for Wnt signaling in the maintenance of 'stemness' in mature memory CD8(+) T cells and have major implications for the design of new vaccination strategies and adoptive immunotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W2042342193,"Philip De Jager and colleagues report results of a large genome-wide association and replication study for multiple sclerosis. The work uncovers three new susceptibility loci for MS, including common and rare variants at TNFRSF1A and common variants at IRF8 and CD6. We report the results of a meta-analysis of genome-wide association scans for multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility that includes 2,624 subjects with MS and 7,220 control subjects. Replication in an independent set of 2,215 subjects with MS and 2,116 control subjects validates new MS susceptibility loci at TNFRSF1A (combined P = 1.59 × 10−11), IRF8 (P = 3.73 × 10−9) and CD6 (P = 3.79 × 10−9). TNFRSF1A harbors two independent susceptibility alleles: rs1800693 is a common variant with modest effect (odds ratio = 1.2), whereas rs4149584 is a nonsynonymous coding polymorphism of low frequency but with stronger effect (allele frequency = 0.02; odds ratio = 1.6). We also report that the susceptibility allele near IRF8, which encodes a transcription factor known to function in type I interferon signaling, is associated with higher mRNA expression of interferon-response pathway genes in subjects with MS."
https://openalex.org/W1981998044,"Hippocampal replay is thought to be essential for the consolidation of event memories in hippocampal-neocortical networks. Replay is present during both sleep and waking behavior, but although sleep replay involves the reactivation of stored representations in the absence of specific sensory inputs, awake replay is thought to depend on sensory input from the current environment. Here, we show that stored representations are reactivated during both waking and sleep replay. We found frequent awake replay of sequences of rat hippocampal place cells from a previous experience. This spatially remote replay was as common as local replay of the current environment and was more robust when the rat had recently been in motion than during extended periods of quiescence. Our results indicate that the hippocampus consistently replays past experiences during brief pauses in waking behavior, suggesting a role for waking replay in memory consolidation and retrieval."
https://openalex.org/W2017760549,Aicardi-Goutières syndrome is a mendelian mimic of congenital infection and also shows overlap with systemic lupus erythematosus at both a clinical and biochemical level. The recent identification of mutations in TREX1 and genes encoding the RNASEH2 complex and studies of the function of TREX1 in DNA metabolism have defined a previously unknown mechanism for the initiation of autoimmunity by interferon-stimulatory nucleic acid. Here we describe mutations in SAMHD1 as the cause of AGS at the AGS5 locus and present data to show that SAMHD1 may act as a negative regulator of the cell-intrinsic antiviral response.

https://openalex.org/W1974010669,"The immunoproteasome, a distinct class of proteasome found predominantly in monocytes and lymphocytes, is known to shape the antigenic repertoire presented on class I major histocompatibility complexes (MHC-I). However, a specific role for the immunoproteasome in regulating other facets of immune responses has not been established. We describe here the characterization of PR-957, a selective inhibitor of low-molecular mass polypeptide-7 (LMP7, encoded by Psmb8), the chymotrypsin-like subunit of the immunoproteasome. PR-957 blocked presentation of LMP7-specific, MHC-I-restricted antigens in vitro and in vivo. Selective inhibition of LMP7 by PR-957 blocked production of interleukin-23 (IL-23) by activated monocytes and interferon-gamma and IL-2 by T cells. In mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis, PR-957 treatment reversed signs of disease and resulted in reductions in cellular infiltration, cytokine production and autoantibody levels. These studies reveal a unique role for LMP7 in controlling pathogenic immune responses and provide a therapeutic rationale for targeting LMP7 in autoimmune disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2049135473,"Cell motility drives many biological processes, including immune responses and embryonic development. In the brain, microglia are immune cells that survey and scavenge brain tissue using elaborate and motile cell processes. The motility of these processes is guided by the local release of chemoattractants. However, most microglial processes retract during prolonged brain injury or disease. This hallmark of brain inflammation remains unexplained. We identified a molecular pathway in mouse and human microglia that converted ATP-driven process extension into process retraction during inflammation. This chemotactic reversal was driven by upregulation of the A(2A) adenosine receptor coincident with P2Y(12) downregulation. Thus, A(2A) receptor stimulation by adenosine, a breakdown product of extracellular ATP, caused activated microglia to assume their characteristic amoeboid morphology during brain inflammation. Our results indicate that purine nucleotides provide an opportunity for context-dependent shifts in receptor signaling. Thus, we reveal an unexpected chemotactic switch that generates a hallmark feature of CNS inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2120442017,"Although the role of Notch signaling in CNS glial development is well established, its participation in peripheral glial development is still unclear. This paper shows that Notch signaling regulates the differentiation of Schwann cell precursors and the proliferation of Schwann cells, and acts as a break on myelination of peripheral nerves. Notch signaling is central to vertebrate development, and analysis of Notch has provided important insights into pathogenetic mechanisms in the CNS and many other tissues. However, surprisingly little is known about the role of Notch in the development and pathology of Schwann cells and peripheral nerves. Using transgenic mice and cell cultures, we found that Notch has complex and extensive regulatory functions in Schwann cells. Notch promoted the generation of Schwann cells from Schwann cell precursors and regulated the size of the Schwann cell pool by controlling proliferation. Notch inhibited myelination, establishing that myelination is subject to negative transcriptional regulation that opposes forward drives such as Krox20. Notably, in the adult, Notch dysregulation resulted in demyelination; this finding identifies a signaling pathway that induces myelin breakdown in vivo. These findings are relevant for understanding the molecular mechanisms that control Schwann cell plasticity and underlie nerve pathology, including demyelinating neuropathies and tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2052970339,"PolyQ-Htt inhibits fast axonal transport in cellular and animal Huntington's disease models. Here, the authors show that this effect is a result of the activation of JNK3. PolyQ-Htt–activated JNK3 reduces kinesin-1 binding to microtubules. Selected vulnerability of neurons in Huntington's disease suggests that alterations occur in a cellular process that is particularly critical for neuronal function. Supporting this idea, pathogenic Htt (polyQ-Htt) inhibits fast axonal transport (FAT) in various cellular and animal models of Huntington's disease (mouse and squid), but the molecular basis of this effect remains unknown. We found that polyQ-Htt inhibited FAT through a mechanism involving activation of axonal cJun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Accordingly, we observed increased activation of JNK in vivo in cellular and mouse models of Huntington's disease. Additional experiments indicated that the effects of polyQ-Htt on FAT were mediated by neuron-specific JNK3 and not by ubiquitously expressed JNK1, providing a molecular basis for neuron-specific pathology in Huntington's disease. Mass spectrometry identified a residue in the kinesin-1 motor domain that was phosphorylated by JNK3 and this modification reduced kinesin-1 binding to microtubules. These data identify JNK3 as a critical mediator of polyQ-Htt toxicity and provide a molecular basis for polyQ-Htt–induced inhibition of FAT."
https://openalex.org/W2153844934,"The aim of this work was to identify micro-RNAs (miRNAs) involved in the pathological pathways activated in skeletal muscle damage and regeneration by both dystrophin absence and acute ischemia. Eleven miRNAs were deregulated both in MDX mice and in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients (DMD signature). Therapeutic interventions ameliorating the mdx-phenotype rescued DMD-signature alterations. The significance of DMD-signature changes was characterized using a damage/regeneration mouse model of hind-limb ischemia and newborn mice. According to their expression, DMD-signature miRNAs were divided into 3 classes. 1) Regeneration miRNAs, miR-31, miR-34c, miR-206, miR-335, miR-449, and miR-494, which were induced in MDX mice and in DMD patients, but also in newborn mice and in newly formed myofibers during postischemic regeneration. Notably, miR-206, miR-34c, and miR-335 were up-regulated following myoblast differentiation in vitro. 2) Degenerative-miRNAs, miR-1, miR-29c, and miR-135a, that were down-modulated in MDX mice, in DMD patients, in the degenerative phase of the ischemia response, and in newborn mice. Their down-modulation was linked to myofiber loss and fibrosis. 3) Inflammatory miRNAs, miR-222 and miR-223, which were expressed in damaged muscle areas, and their expression correlated with the presence of infiltrating inflammatory cells. These findings show an important role of miRNAs in physiopathological pathways regulating muscle response to damage and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1978268544,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness worldwide, is as prevalent as cancer in industrialized nations. Most blindness in AMD results from invasion of the retina by choroidal neovascularisation (CNV). Here we show that the eosinophil/mast cell chemokine receptor CCR3 is specifically expressed in choroidal neovascular endothelial cells in humans with AMD, and that despite the expression of its ligands eotaxin-1, -2 and -3, neither eosinophils nor mast cells are present in human CNV. Genetic or pharmacological targeting of CCR3 or eotaxins inhibited injury-induced CNV in mice. CNV suppression by CCR3 blockade was due to direct inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation, and was uncoupled from inflammation because it occurred in mice lacking eosinophils or mast cells, and was independent of macrophage and neutrophil recruitment. CCR3 blockade was more effective at reducing CNV than vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) neutralization, which is in clinical use at present, and, unlike VEGF-A blockade, is not toxic to the mouse retina. In vivo imaging with CCR3-targeting quantum dots located spontaneous CNV invisible to standard fluorescein angiography in mice before retinal invasion. CCR3 targeting might reduce vision loss due to AMD through early detection and therapeutic angioinhibition. More than 30 million people worldwide are affected by age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. The standard treatments for the blinding neovascular form of the disease are anti-VEGF drugs — principally ranibizumab (Lucentis) and bevacizumab (Avastin) — but they improve vision in only a third of patients and there is concern about possible toxicity as VEGF plays an important role in normal retinal functioning. Now the identification of the cytokine receptor CCR3 as an early detection marker of the disease in a mouse model raises the possibility of early diagnosis, which would be an important contribution to improving clinical outcome. In addition, targeting CCR3 or its ligands, which inhibits the invasion of the retina by new blood vessels, may provide a safe alternative means of treatment. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of blindness. Now, the eosinophil/mast cell chemokine receptor CCR3 is shown to be specifically expressed in choroidal neovascular endothelial cells in humans with AMD, and targeting CCR3 or its ligands in mice inhibits the choroidal neovascularization that underlies AMD. In the mouse model, CCR3 blockade was more effective and less toxic than VEGF-A neutralization, which is currently in clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W2132854782,"Caveolae are plasma membrane invaginations implicated in endocytosis. SDPR is a new component of caveolae that facilitates membrane curvature, caveolae formation and tubulation induced by extracellular ligands such as Shiga toxin B. Caveolae are plasma membrane invaginations with a characteristic flask-shaped morphology. They function in diverse cellular processes, including endocytosis. The mechanism by which caveolae are generated is not fully understood, but both caveolin proteins and PTRF (polymerase I and transcript release factor, also known as cavin) are important. Here we show that loss of SDPR (serum deprivation protein response) causes loss of caveolae. SDPR binds directly to PTRF and recruits PTRF to caveolar membranes. Overexpression of SDPR, unlike PTRF, induces deformation of caveolae and extensive tubulation of the plasma membrane. The B-subunit of Shiga toxin (STB) also induces membrane tubulation and these membrane tubes also originate from caveolae. STB colocalizes extensively with both SDPR and caveolin 1. Loss of caveolae reduces the propensity of STB to induce membrane tubulation. We conclude that SDPR is a membrane-curvature-inducing component of caveolae, and that STB-induced membrane tubulation is facilitated by caveolae."

https://openalex.org/W2034232365,"To address the biological heterogeneity of lung cancer, we studied 199 lung adenocarcinomas by integrating genome-wide data on copy number alterations and gene expression with full annotation for major known somatic mutations in this cancer. This showed non-random patterns of copy number alterations significantly linked to EGFR and KRAS mutation status and to distinct clinical outcomes, and led to the discovery of a striking association of EGFR mutations with underexpression of DUSP4, a gene within a broad region of frequent single-copy loss on 8p. DUSP4 is involved in negative feedback control of EGFR signaling, and we provide functional validation for its role as a growth suppressor in EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. DUSP4 loss also associates with p16/CDKN2A deletion and defines a distinct clinical subset of lung cancer patients. Another novel observation is that of a reciprocal relationship between EGFR and LKB1 mutations. These results highlight the power of integrated genomics to identify candidate driver genes within recurrent broad regions of copy number alteration and to delineate distinct oncogenetic pathways in genetically complex common epithelial cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2157963865,"Chromatin decondensation is required for repair factors to access damaged DNA. BRIT1/MCPH1, a damage response protein mutated in microcephaly, recruits the chromatin remodelling complex SWI/SNF to sites of DNA damage after phosphorylation by ATM/ATR. This mechanism is critical for efficient DNA repair and survival. To detect and repair damaged DNA, DNA-damage-response proteins need to overcome the barrier of condensed chromatin to gain access to DNA lesions1. ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling is one of the fundamental mechanisms used by cells to relax chromatin in DNA repair2,3. However, the mechanism mediating their recruitment to DNA lesions remains largely unknown. BRIT1 (also known as MCPH1) is an early DNA-damage-response protein that is mutated in human primary microcephaly4,5,6,7,8. Here we report a previously unknown function of BRIT1 as a regulator of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complex SWI–SNF in DNA repair. After damage to DNA, BRIT1 increases its interaction with SWI–SNF through ATM/ATR-dependent phosphorylation on the BAF170 subunit. This increase in binding affinity provides a means by which SWI–SNF can be specifically recruited to and maintained at DNA lesions. Loss of BRIT1 causes impaired chromatin relaxation as a result of decreased association of SWI–SNF with chromatin. This explains the decreased recruitment of repair proteins to DNA lesions and the reduced efficiency of repair in BRIT1-deficient cells, resulting in impaired cell survival after DNA damage. Our findings therefore identify BRIT1 as a key molecule that links chromatin remodelling with response to DNA damage in the control of DNA repair, and its dysfunction contributes to human disease."

https://openalex.org/W2091269769,"The mosaic analysis with repressible cell markers (MARCM) technique allows for lineage tracing in Drosophila. Here, the authors report an improvement on this technique, twin-spot MARCM, which permits high-resolution lineage tracing of both sister clones. A comprehensive understanding of the brain requires the analysis of individual neurons. We used twin-spot mosaic analysis with repressible cell markers (twin-spot MARCM) to trace cell lineages at high resolution by independently labeling paired sister clones. We determined patterns of neurogenesis and the influences of lineage on neuron-type specification. Notably, neural progenitors were able to yield intermediate precursors that create one, two or more neurons. Furthermore, neurons acquired stereotyped projections according to their temporal position in various brain sublineages. Twin-spot MARCM also permitted birth dating of mutant clones, enabling us to detect a single temporal fate that required chinmo in a sublineage of six Drosophila central complex neurons. In sum, twin-spot MARCM can reveal the developmental origins of neurons and the mechanisms that underlie cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W263277881,"Proper chromosome congression (the process of aligning chromosomes on the spindle) contributes to accurate and faithful chromosome segregation. It is widely accepted that congression requires kinetochore fibres (K-fibres), microtubule bundles that extend from the kinetochores to spindle poles. Here, we demonstrate that chromosomes in human cells co-depleted of HSET (human kinesin-14) and hNuf2 (human Ndc80/Hec1-complex component) can congress to the metaphase plate in the absence of K-fibres. However, the chromosomes are not stably maintained at the metaphase plate under these conditions. Chromosome congression in HSET + hNuf2 co-depleted cells required the plus-end directed motor CENP-E (centromere protein E; kinesin-7 family member), which has been implicated in the gliding of mono-oriented kinetochores alongside adjacent K-fibres. Thus, proper end-on attachment of kinetochores to microtubules is not necessary for chromosome congression. Instead, our data support the idea that congression allows unattached chromosomes to move to the middle of the spindle where they have a higher probability of establishing connections with both spindle poles. These bi-oriented connections are also used to maintain stable chromosome alignment at the spindle equator."
https://openalex.org/W2079624700,"Although centrosomes serve to organize microtubules in most cell types, oocyte spindles form and mediate meiotic chromosome segregation in their absence. Here, we used high-resolution imaging of both bipolar and experimentally generated monopolar spindles in Caenorhabditis elegans to reveal a surprising organization of microtubules and chromosomes within acentrosomal structures. We found that homologous chromosome pairs (bivalents) are surrounded by microtubule bundles running along their sides, whereas microtubule density is extremely low at chromosome ends despite a high concentration of kinetochore proteins at those regions. Furthermore, we found that the chromokinesin KLP-19 (kinesin-like protein 19) is targeted to a ring around the centre of each bivalent and provides a polar ejection force that is required for congression. Together, these observations create a new picture of chromosome-microtubule association in acentrosomal spindles and reveal a mechanism by which metaphase alignment can be achieved using this organization. Specifically, we propose that ensheathment by lateral microtubule bundles places spatial constraints on the chromosomes, thereby promoting biorientation, and that localized motors mediate movement along these bundles, thereby promoting alignment."
https://openalex.org/W2003121559,"Natural hosts of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)—such as African green monkeys—have evolved to tolerate SIV infection without developing immune deficiency. Jason Brenchley and his colleagues provide a mechanism. They show that CD4+ T cells from these animals downregulate the CD4 receptor upon entering the memory pool. Immune functions normally attributed to CD4+ T cells are preserved, but the cells become resistant to SIV infection. African green monkeys (genus Chlorocebus) can be infected with species-specific simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVagm) but do not develop AIDS. These natural hosts of SIV, like sooty mangabeys, maintain high levels of SIV replication but have evolved to avoid immunodeficiency. Elucidating the mechanisms that allow natural hosts to coexist with SIV without overt disease may provide crucial information for understanding AIDS pathogenesis. Here we show that many CD4+ T cells from African green monkeys downregulate CD4 in vivo as they enter the memory pool; that downregulation of CD4 by memory T cells is independent of SIV infection; that the CD4− memory T cells maintain functions that are normally attributed to CD4+ T cells, including production of interleukin-2 (IL-2), production of IL-17, expression of forkhead box P3 and expression of CD40 ligand; that loss of CD4 expression protects these T cells from infection by SIVagm in vivo; and that these CD4− T cells can maintain major histocompatibility complex class II restriction. These data show that the absence of SIV-induced disease progression in natural host species may be partially explained by preservation of a subset of T cells that maintain CD4+ T cell function while being resistant to SIV infection in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2138562519,"Loss of hand use is considered by many spinal cord injury survivors to be the most devastating consequence of their injury. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) of forearm and hand muscles has been used to provide basic, voluntary hand grasp to hundreds of human patients. Current approaches typically grade pre-programmed patterns of muscle activation using simple control signals, such as those derived from residual movement or muscle activity. However, the use of such fixed stimulation patterns limits hand function to the few tasks programmed into the controller. In contrast, we are developing a system that uses neural signals recorded from a multi-electrode array implanted in the motor cortex; this system has the potential to provide independent control of multiple muscles over a broad range of functional tasks. Two monkeys were able to use this cortically controlled FES system to control the contraction of four forearm muscles despite temporary limb paralysis. The amount of wrist force the monkeys were able to produce in a one-dimensional force tracking task was significantly increased. Furthermore, the monkeys were able to control the magnitude and time course of the force with sufficient accuracy to track visually displayed force targets at speeds reduced by only one-third to one-half of normal. Although these results were achieved by controlling only four muscles, there is no fundamental reason why the same methods could not be scaled up to control a larger number of muscles. We believe these results provide an important proof of concept that brain-controlled FES prostheses could ultimately be of great benefit to paralyzed patients with injuries in the mid-cervical spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W2168411960,"Humans learn to speak by a process of vocal imitation that requires the availability of auditory feedback. Similarly, young birds rely on auditory feedback when learning to imitate the songs of adult birds, providing one of the few examples of nonhuman vocal learning. However, although humans continue to use auditory feedback to correct vocal errors in adulthood, the mechanisms underlying the stability of adult birdsong are unknown. We found that, similar to human speech, adult birdsong is maintained by error correction. We perturbed the pitch (fundamental frequency) of auditory feedback in adult Bengalese finches using custom-designed headphones. Birds compensated for the imposed auditory error by adjusting the pitch of song. When the perturbation was removed, pitch returned to baseline. Our results indicate that adult birds correct vocal errors by comparing auditory feedback to a sensory target and suggest that lifelong error correction is a general principle of learned vocal behavior."

Based on this enzymatic property, a gene silencing technology has been developed, in which a specific mRNA level can be downregulated by introducing into cells a synthetic 5′-half-tRNA that is designed to form a pre-tRNA-like complex with a part of the mRNA. Recently 5′-half-tRNA fragments have been reported to exist stably in various types of cells, although little is know about their physiological roles. We were curious to know if endogenous 5′-half-tRNA works as sgRNA for tRNase ZL in the cells. Here we show that human cytosolic tRNase ZL modulates gene expression through 5′-half-tRNA. We found that 5′-half-tRNAGlu, which co-immunoprecipitates with tRNase ZL, exists predominantly in the cytoplasm, functions as sgRNA in vitro, and downregulates the level of a luciferase mRNA containing its target sequence in human kidney 293 cells. We also demonstrated that the PPM1F mRNA is one of the genuine targets of tRNase ZL guided by 5′-half-tRNAGlu. Furthermore, the DNA microarray data suggested that tRNase ZL is likely to be involved in the p53 signaling pathway and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2050745211,"Background Pathogenic bacteria infecting both animals as well as plants use various mechanisms to transport virulence factors across their cell membranes and channel these proteins into the infected host cell. The type III secretion system represents such a mechanism. Proteins transported via this pathway (“effector proteins”) have to be distinguished from all other proteins that are not exported from the bacterial cell. Although a special targeting signal at the N-terminal end of effector proteins has been proposed in literature its exact characteristics remain unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we demonstrate that the signals encoded in the sequences of type III secretion system effectors can be consistently recognized and predicted by machine learning techniques. Known protein effectors were compiled from the literature and sequence databases, and served as training data for artificial neural networks and support vector machine classifiers. Common sequence features were most pronounced in the first 30 amino acids of the effector sequences. Classification accuracy yielded a cross-validated Matthews correlation of 0.63 and allowed for genome-wide prediction of potential type III secretion system effectors in 705 proteobacterial genomes (12% predicted candidates protein), their chromosomes (11%) and plasmids (13%), as well as 213 Firmicute genomes (7%). Conclusions/Significance We present a signal prediction method together with comprehensive survey of potential type III secretion system effectors extracted from 918 published bacterial genomes. Our study demonstrates that the analyzed signal features are common across a wide range of species, and provides a substantial basis for the identification of exported pathogenic proteins as targets for future therapeutic intervention.

Alteration of GJIC caused by changes in Cx43 has been proposed to be involved in the pathophysiology of diverse IEC barrier diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases, necrotizing enterocolitis, cancer, and enteric infection (10Dubina M.V.

Nature. 2007; 449: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that commensal-mediated TLR2 helps to maintain functional TJ barrier integrity of the intestinal epithelial layer. TLR2 enhances transepithelial resistance of the IEC barrier by apical redistribution of ZO-1 via protein kinase Cα/δ (17Cario E. Gerken G. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 224-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Treatment with the TLR2 ligand PCSK protects ZO-1-associated IEC barrier integrity and decreases intestinal permeability in acute colitis (18Cario E. Gerken G. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 1359-1374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Previous studies in other cell types have demonstrated that the second PDZ domain of ZO-1 interacts with the carboxyl terminus of Cx43 (19Giepmans B.N. Moolenaar W.H. Curr.

ZO-1 binds to Cx43 preferentially during the G0 phase, enhancing assembly and stabilization of GJIC (21Singh D. Solan J.L. Taffet S.M. Javier R. Lampe P.D. J. Biol.

In this study, we identified a new physiological mechanism of innate immune host defense in the injured intestine. Our findings indicated that Cx43 serves as an important component of the protective innate immune response of the intestinal epithelium. TLR2-induced GJIC via Cx43 appears to control IEC barrier function and restitution during acute and chronic inflammatory damage, enhancing mucosal homeostasis between commensals and host. UC-associated TLR2 mutant results in impaired GJIC by a proteasomal-dependent increase in Cx43 turnover. Synthetic lipopeptide Pam3Cys-SKKKKx3-HCl (PCSK; Lots L08/02 and A10/02) was obtained from EMC Microcollections GmbH (17Cario E. Gerken G. Podolsky D.K.

Polyclonal antibodies to phosphorylated Cx43 at Ser368 (antibody 3511) (28Solan J.L. Fry M.D. TenBroek E.M. Lampe P.D. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2203-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was purchased from Cell Signaling. Pan-cytokeratin polyclonal/monoclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-human TLR2 monoclonal antibody (clone TL2.1) was from Alexis Biotechnology. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from GE Healthcare-Amersham Biosciences. Lactacystin was from Merck. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise specified. MDR1α−/− mice (FVB.129P2-Abcb1atm1Bor; >F7) and appropriate WT controls (FVB/N) were purchased and bred under the Research Agreement from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY). TLR2−/− mice (Tlr2tm1Kir; >F10 (C57BL6/J); The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) and their WT controls (C57BL6/J) have previously been described (18Cario E. Gerken G. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 1359-1374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). All of the mice were housed and bred in the same room under strict specific pathogen-free conditions (Helicobacter species, murine norovirus-free) at the Central Animal Facility of University Hospital of Essen (Essen, Germany). Extensive animal health monitoring was conducted routinely on representative mice from this room (Gesellschaft für innovative Mikroökologie mbH, Wildenbruch, Germany). The animals were provided with autoclaved tap water and autoclaved standard laboratory chow ad libitum. All male MDR1α−/− developed loose stools and mucous discharge by ∼8 weeks of age in our specific pathogen-free room, and therefore only male MDR1α−/− were included in this study. Histology scoring was modified according to previous reports (29Mizoguchi E. Mizoguchi A. Takedatsu H. Cario E. de Jong Y.P. Ooi C.J. Xavier R.J. Terhorst C. Podolsky D.K. Bhan A.K.

Colitis was induced in TLR2−/− or WT by the addition of DSS (molecular weight, 36,000–50,000; Lot 6955H; MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) in different concentrations in drinking water for 5 days (18Cario E. Gerken G. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 1359-1374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Female mice aged 8–11 weeks old were used for DSS studies. All of the protocols were in compliance with German law for use of live animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University Hospital of Essen and the responsible district government. Caco-2 and IEC-6 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained as described previously (17Cario E. Gerken G. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 224-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). HA-tagged TLR2 full-length (TLR2-FL) and HA-tagged TLR4 full-length (TLR4-FL) plasmids in the same backbone vector were obtained from InvivoGen. UC mutant TLR2-R753Q was generated within the TLR2-FL expression construct and confirmed by sequencing (Trenzyme). Plasmids (EndoFree Maxi; Qiagen) were transfected into Caco-2 cells on a 12-well plate using 1 μg/well of TLR2-FL, TLR4-FL, or TLR2-R753Q (Lipofectamine LTX; Invitrogen). Stable transfectants were selected with 1 μg/ml blasticidin and maintained on poly-d-lysine-coated tissue culture plates (BD Biosciences). Transfection efficiency of the different clones was comparable with previous findings from other cell types (31Merx S. Neumaier M. Wagner H. Kirschning C.J. Ahmad-Nejad P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), as tested by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry with anti-HA (InvivoGen; Cell Signaling). Caco-2 controls (mock) were untransfected cells without any exogenous DNA. Fresh tissue samples from healthy patients undergoing complete colonoscopy for regular colon cancer screening examinations and/or polypectomy were collected at the Endoscopy Unit, Department of Gastroenterology and Metabolic Diseases (Head: M. Rünzi, M.D.), Kliniken Essen-Süd (Essen, Germany). Informed consent was obtained from all patients before the procedure, and the protocol was approved by the Human Studies Committee of Kliniken Essen-Süd. Small cecal specimens were obtained by gently touching down the biopsy forceps onto the mucosal surface. The samples were immediately washed twice in ice-cold Hanks舗 buffered salt solution (PAA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, gentamicin, and antibiotic/antimycotic solution; then mixed with or without PCSK (20 μg/ml) into a thin layer of cold liquid Matrigel (BD Biosciences) surrounding the biopsy, which was allowed to polymerize, forming a solid gel at 37 °C within 30 min; then covered with warm full L-15 medium; and cultured for 4 h. Matrigel biopsy blocks were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura), and stored at −20 °C until further processing. For assessment of GJ communication by microinjection, 5% Lucifer Yellow CH dye (lithium salt in 100 mm water solution; Invitrogen) was injected into IEC-6 cells, and dye transfer was quantitated by determining the number of directly adjacent cells that received dye (dye coupling). The cells were visualized using an inverted phase contrast/confocal laser microscope (LD-Achroplan 40×/0.6 corr (dry) objective; Zeiss LSM510; Axiovert 100M) and injected using a transinjector with micromanipulator (model 5246/5171; Eppendorf). The frequencies of dye transfer to directly adjacent cells were determined in the presence or absence of PCSK 37s after dye injection (pi = 60 hPa; pc = 20 hPa; ti = 0.2 s) with or without cell injury by acquiring fluorescent images in an automated time series with an interval of 11.671 s, with each confocal scan set to take 3.8 s. Control dye was 10% tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-dextran (molecular weight, 3000) in 100 mm LiCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8. The nuclei were counterstained with cell-permeant SytoGreen fluorescent nucleic acid stain (Invitrogen). For assessment of GJ communication by scrape wound loading, Lucifer Yellow CH (0.05% dye in phosphate-buffered saline (without Ca2+ and Mg2+)) was loaded intracellularly by scraping Caco-2-TLR2-FL and Caco-2-TLR2-R753Q cells with a razor blade. The dye solution was left in the dish for 8 min. After washing, fixation, immunostaining with anti-Lucifer Yellow rabbit polyclonal antibody (Invitrogen) followed by FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch), and mounting with Vectashield/DAPI, the cells were examined for dye transfer using a laser-scanning confocal microscope Zeiss Axiovert 100M-LSM 510. The degree of communication was assessed by determining the extent of Lucifer Yellow transfer into contiguous cells. The mice received 2.3% DSS in drinking water for 5 days, followed by oral PCSK therapy (see Fig. 6A). siRNA targeting murine Cx43 (siGENOME on-Target plus SMART pool; catalog number L-051694-00-0005; accession number NM_010288) and scrambled controls (siGENOME on-Target plus siCONTROL pool; catalog number D-001810-10-05) were obtained from Dharmacon and resuspended in sterile RNase-free water. siRNA was freshly lipoplexed with Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and administered immediately (5 nmol in 20 μl of solution/mouse) to the rectum of isoflurane-anesthesized WT mice (C57BL6/J) once daily (days 3–5) using a P20 pipettor (Eppendorf), as described previously (32Zhang Y. Cristofaro P. Silbermann R. Pusch O. Boden D. Konkin T. Hovanesian V. Monfils P.R. Resnick M. Moss S.F. Ramratnam B. Mol. Ther. 2006; 14: 336-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Five hours after receiving the last siRNA treatment, control groups (n = 5 mice/group; group 1, Cx43siRNA (−PCSK); group 2, scrambled (−PCSK)) were sacrificed on day 5 without PCSK therapy, and the rectum was removed and evaluated for rectal epithelial Cx43 protein expression at the local site of siRNA application by immunohistochemistry, as described below. The rest (n = 4–5 mice/group; group 3, Cx43siRNA (−PCSK); group 4, Cx43siRNA (+PCSK); group 5, scrambled (−PCSK); group 6, scrambled (+PCSK)) were sacrificed on day 9 with or without PCSK therapy, and the entire colon was removed from cecum to anus, and colon length was measured as a marker of inflammation. For histologic examination, frozen cross-sections (7 μm; every 60 μm) throughout the application site of the rectum were obtained and stained with a hematoxylin-eosin kit (Polysciences). The degree of DSS-induced acute inflammation in the rectum was graded blinded, as described previously (18Cario E. Gerken G. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 1359-1374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Frozen sections were cut (7 μm) and mounted on Superfrost Plus Gold slides (Thermo). The cells were directly grown on coated culture slides. For detection of murine/human Cx43 (clone CX-1B1), ZO-1, and TLR2, sections were fixed in acetone (100%) for 1 min at −20 °C followed by air-drying and washing with phosphate-buffered saline. The sections were then blocked with normal goat serum (1:100 in phosphate-buffered saline) for 60 min at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies (1:50; for pan-cytokeratin, 1:25) overnight at 4 °C. Alexa Fluor®488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes-Invitrogen) and/or CY5/FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) antibodies were used as secondary antibodies (1:100, 60 min, room temperature). After mounting with Vectashield mounting medium with propidium iodide or DAPI (Vector Laboratories), immunofluorescent sections were assessed using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Plan-Neofluar 40×/1.3 (oil) or Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 (oil) differential interference contrast objectives; Zeiss Axiovert 100M-LSM 510), as described previously (18Cario E. Gerken G. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 1359-1374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 33Cario E. Golenbock D.T. Visintin A. Rünzi M. Gerken G. Podolsky D.K. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 4258-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, the multitrack option of the microscope and sequential scanning for each channel were used to eliminate any cross-talk. All of the images were captured under identical laser settings. The results were only considered significant if more than 80% of the scanned sections/field exhibited the observed effect. Standardized three-dimensional reconstructions and extractions of co-localized areas were generated using LSM 510 v.3.2 software. Control experiments were performed with isotype control IgG (Santa Cruz or Ebioscience) or omitting the primary antibody. All of the experiments were repeated at least twice; representative results are shown for each experiment and subgroup as indicated. Proteins from whole colon samples of distal parts were isolated using the T-PER tissue protein extraction reagent (Thermo) supplemented with complete mini protease ± PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor mixture tablets and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride Plus (Roche Applied Science). Dephosphorylation reaction of Cx43 was carried out by incubating tissue lysates for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence (1 unit/μg) of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Promega). ZO-1 was detected in whole colonic samples as described previously (18Cario E. Gerken G. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 1359-1374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). The lysates were mechanically disrupted by a tissue disruptor homogenizer (Qiagen). For preparation of subcellular fractions, the ProteoExtract subcellular proteome extraction kit from Merck was used according to the manufacturer舗s instructions. Immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting and mouse 62-cyto/chemokine antibody array III (RayBiotech) were performed as described previously (18Cario E. Gerken G. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 1359-1374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 33Cario E. Golenbock D.T. Visintin A. Rünzi M. Gerken G. Podolsky D.K. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 4258-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All of the experiments were repeated at least twice; representative results are shown for each experiment. Total RNA samples from cells and murine colons were extracted using the RiboPure RNA Isolation kit from Ambion and purified using the RNeasy mini kit with RNase-free DNase from Qiagen, following the manufacturers舗 instructions. For conventional RT-PCR analysis, reverse transcription of 50 ng of each RNA sample was performed with Sensiscript RT (Qiagen). 2 μl of the RT reaction was used for subsequent PCR (HotStar Taq DNA polymerase; Qiagen) in duplicate. PCR primers (Primer-BLAST, NCBI) were as follows: human Cx43, 5′-GGA CAT GCA CTT GAA GCA GA and 5′-CAG GAG GAG ACA TAG GCG AG (37 cycles); and human ZO-1, 5′-GTC TGC CAT TAC ACG GTC CT and 5′-GGT CTC TGC TGG CTT GTT TC (32 cycles). Species nonspecific GAPDH primers have previously been described (13Cario E. Rosenberg I.M. Brandwein S.L. Beck P.L. Reinecker H.C. Podolsky D.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Negative controls included water or RNA sample as template. All of the PCR products were resolved by 1–2% agarose gel electrophoresis, and DNA bands were visualized by staining the gel with ethidium bromide. For real time PCR analysis, QuantiTect Primer Assays (Qiagen) were used as the gene-specific primer pairs for human Cx43 (QT00012684), human ZO-1 (QT00077308), human GAPDH (QT01192646), mouse Cx43 (QT00173635), mouse ZO-1 (QT00493899), mouse TFF3 (QT00108857), mouse interferon γ (QT01038821), mouse IL-2 (QT00112315), mouse IL-12p40 (QT00153643), mouse IL-23R (QT00138719), mouse IL-4 (QT00160678), mouse IL-6 (QT00098875), mouse IL-10 (QT00106169), mouse IL-13 (QT00099554), and mouse GAPDH (QT00309099). Quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed at least in duplicate using the one-step QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) on the Rotor-Gene 2000 real time amplification system (Corbett Research), according to the manufacturer舗s protocols. Copy numbers of individual transcripts were normalized in parallel against GAPDH as endogenous control (X/100,000 copies of GAPDH). The mRNA level in untreated cells or tissues (as indicated under “Results”) was defined as 1 arbitrary unit. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. of two or more independent experiments, as indicated. The differences between means were evaluated using the two-tailed, unpaired t test (GraphPad Prism version 4.03, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), where appropriate. p values of <0.05 were considered as significant. To determine whether ZO-1 complexes with cellular Cx43 in IEC, we performed co-immunolabeling using confocal laser microscopy. ZO-1 and Cx43 were predominantly localized at the apical and lateral plasma membrane in the human model IEC line Caco-2 (Fig. 1A) and were frequently but not exclusively co-localized at distinct cell-cell contacts (overlay panel) in typical punctuate staining patterns (extracted panel). Constitutive interaction between ZO-1 and Cx43 in Caco-2 cells was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (data not shown). We next studied the effects of TLR2 in regulating synthesis of the ZO-1-Cx43 complex in IEC. Stimulation of Caco-2 cells with the synthetic TLR2 ligand PCSK increased Cx43 mRNA within 3 h, with a maximum of 3-fold activation after 6 h (Fig. 1B). After 12 h, Cx43 mRNA expression returned to low control levels. Subcellular fractions of intestinal epithelial Cx43 protein electrophoresed as typical multiple isoforms when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C), including a faster migrating, nonphosphorylated form (P0; ∼42 kDa), and two slower migrating, phosphorylated forms, termed P1 (∼44 kDa) and P2 (∼46 kDa), consistent with previous reports from other cell types (5Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 26Cruciani V. Mikalsen S.O. Exp.

PCSK stimulation for 3 h led to redistribution of Cx43-P2 from the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. In contrast, TLR2 stimulation did not modulate ZO-1 gene transcription or protein expression in IEC in vitro. To analyze intestinal epithelial GJIC functionality in response to TLR2 activation, we next performed microinjection studies to determine the incidence and extent of dye coupling between IEC with or without PCSK treatment. For optimal microinjection conditions, we used IEC-6 cells, which form a simple, confluent monolayer of polyglonal epithelial cells in culture and express both TLR2 (18Cario E. Gerken G. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 1359-1374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) and Cx43 (11Leaphart C.L. Qureshi F. Cetin S. Li J. Dubowski T. Baty C. Beer-Stolz D. Guo F. Murray S.A. Hackam D.J. Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 2395-2411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). IEC-6 cells were microinjected with Lucifer Yellow, which readily passes through GJ (Fig. 2A). Rhodamine-dextran (not transferable through GJ) and SytoGreen (cell-permeant nuclear stain) were used as control markers of cell and nucleus intactness, respectively (Fig. 2B). Under basal conditions, most IEC-6 cells were not dye-coupled (Fig. 2A, upper panel). The presence of PCSK did not increase the efficacy of dye spreading. However, when the IEC-6 cell was injured by microinjection, the incidence of intercellular diffusion was increased, with most cells showing dye coupling with four or five neighboring cells (Fig. 2A, lower panel), suggesting that cellular damage is required to activate GJIC between otherwise quiescent IEC-6 cells. PCSK rapidly increased the extent of dye transfer around single cell injuries, showing 10–11 coupled cells/injection. In addition, GJ-mediated intercellular diffusion was sustained longer in PCSK-treated c"
https://openalex.org/W2142460700,"Developing nondopaminergic palliative treatments for Parkinson's disease represents a major challenge to avoid the debilitating side effects produced by L-DOPA therapy. Increasing interest is addressed to the selective targeting of group III metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors that inhibit transmitter release at presumably overactive synapses in the basal ganglia. Here we characterize the functional action of a new orthosteric group III mGlu agonist, LSP1-2111, with a preferential affinity for mGlu4 receptor. In mouse brain slices, LSP1-2111 inhibits striatopallidal GABAergic transmission by selectively activating the mGlu4 receptor but has no effect at a synapse modulated solely by the mGlu7 and mGlu8 receptors. Intrapallidal LSP1-2111 infusion reverses the akinesia produced by nigrostriatal dopamine depletion in a reaction time task, whereas an mGlu8-receptor agonist has no effect. Finally, systemic administration of LSP1-2111 counteracts haloperidol-induced catalepsy, opening promising perspectives for the development of antiparkinsonian therapeutic strategies focused on orthosteric mGlu4-receptor agonists."
https://openalex.org/W2154524741,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a well-established stimulator of vascular permeability and angiogenesis, whereas thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a potent angiogenic inhibitor. In this study, we have found that the TSP-1 receptors CD36 and beta1 integrin associate with the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2). The coclustering of receptors that regulate angiogenesis may provide the endothelial cell with a platform for integration of positive and negative signals in the plane of the membrane. Thus, this complex may represent a molecular switch that regulates angiogenesis and determines endothelial cell behavior. In this context, physiological levels of TSP-1 appear to support VEGFR2 function on both the cellular and tissue level, because phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and vascular permeability in response to VEGF are decreased in TSP-1-null mice and isolated endothelial cells. A therapeutic agent based on the antiangiogenic domain of TSP-1, designated 3TSR (for three TSP-1 type 1 repeats), has significant antiangiogenic and antitumor efficacy. Systemic treatment of wild-type mice with 3TSR significantly decreased VEGF-induced permeability. Consistent with this result, VEGF-stimulated phosphorylation of VEGFR2 was also significantly decreased in lung extracts from 3TSR-treated mice. Moreover, 3TSR significantly decreased VEGF-stimulated VEGFR2 phosphorylation in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells in culture. Taken together, the results indicate that TSP-1 and 3TSR modulate the function of VEGFR2."
https://openalex.org/W2075821278,"RASSF2 is a tumour suppressor that in common with the rest of the RASSF family contains Ras association and SARAH domains. We identified the proapoptotic kinases, MST1 and MST2, as the most significant binding partners of RASSF2, confirmed the interactions at endogenous levels and showed that RASSF2 immunoprecipitates active MST1/2. We then showed that RASSF2 can be phosphorylated by a co-immunoprecipitating kinase that is likely to be MST1/2. Furthermore, we showed that RASSF2 and MST2 do indeed colocalize, but whereas RASSF2 alone is nuclear, the presence of MST1 or MST2 results in colocalization in the cytoplasm. Expression of RASSF2 (stably in MCF7 or transiently in HEK-293) increases MST2 levels and knockdown of RASSF2 in HEK-293 cells reduces MST2 levels, in addition colorectal tumour cell lines and primary tumours with low RASSF2 levels show decreased MST2 protein levels. This is likely to be mediated by RASSF2-dependent protection of MST2 against proteolytic degradation. Our findings suggest that MST2 and RASSF2 form an active complex in vivo, in which RASSF2 is maintained in a phosphorylated state and protects MST2 from degradation and turnover. Thus, we propose that the frequent loss of RASSF2 in tumours results in the destablization of MST2 and thus decreased apoptotic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2089566302,"Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 plays critical roles in tumor development and in the metastasis of multiple cancers, including human oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC). One of the upstream regulators of MMP-2 is FOXM1, which is overexpressed in a microarray dataset of OCSCC. It is interesting that FLJ10540 exhibits similar gene expression profiles with MMP-2 and FOXM1, raising the possibility that these molecules might participate in MMP-2-elicited cancer progression and metastasis of OCSCC. To examine this connection, we first showed that FLJ10540 was significantly overexpressed in OCSCC. A strong FLJ10540 expression was significantly correlated with an advanced tumor node metastasis stage and the cumulative 5-year survival rate. Thus, an elevated FLJ10540 expression is an indicator of poor survival. Functionally, FLJ10540 had the abilities to stimulate cell migration and invasion in oral cancer cells through increased FOXM1 and MMP-2 expressions. Conversely, the depletion of the FLJ10540 expression by small interfering RNAs suppressed the FOXM1 and MMP-2 protein expressions. The suppression of either FLJ10540 or FOXM1 could cause significant inhibition on cell migratory and invasive ability in oral cancer cells. Finally, the immunohistochemical and western blotting analyses of human aggressive OCSCC specimens showed a significant positive correlation among FLJ10540, FOXM1 and MMP-2 expressions. These findings suggest that FLJ10540 is not only an important prognostic factor but also a new therapeutic target in the FLJ10540/FOXM1/MMP-2 pathway for OCSCC treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2169644482,"In order to identify novel high value antibacterial targets it is desirable to delineate whether the inactivation of the target enzyme will lead to bacterial death or stasis. This knowledge is particularly important in slow growing organisms, like mycobacteria, where most of the viable anti-tubercular agents are bactericidal. A bactericidal target can be identified through the conditional deletion or inactivation of the target gene at a relatively high cell number and subsequently following the time course of survival for the bacteria. A simple protocol to execute conditional inactivation of a gene is by antisense expression. We have developed a mycobacteria specific IPTG inducible vector system and monitored the effect of antisense inhibition of several known essential genes in mycobacteria by following their survival kinetics. By this method, we could differentiate between genes whose down regulation lead to bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect. Targets for standard anti-tubercular drugs like inhA for isoniazid, rpoB and C for rifampicin, and gyr A/B for flouroquinolones were shown to be bactericidal. In contrast targets like FtsZ behaved in a bacteriostatic manner. Induction of antisense expression in embB and ribosomal RNA genes, viz., rplJ and rpsL showed only a marginal growth inhibition. The specificity of the antisense inhibition was conclusively shown in the case of auxotrophic gene ilvB. The bactericidal activity following antisense expression of ilvB was completely reversed when the growth media was supplemented with the isoleucine, leucine, valine and pantothenate. Additionally, under these conditions the expression of several genes in branched chain amino acid pathway was severely suppressed indicating targeted gene inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1994390460,"The Ste20-like kinase, SLK, is involved in the control of cell motility through its effects on actin reorganization and focal adhesion turnover. Here we investigated the role of SLK in chemotaxis downstream of the tyrosine kinase receptor, HER2/ErbB2/Neu, which is frequently overexpressed in human breast cancers. Our results show that SLK is required for the efficient cell migration of human and mouse mammary epithelial cell lines in the presence of the Neu activator, heregulin, as a chemoattractant. SLK activity is stimulated by heregulin treatment or by overexpression of activated Neu. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 1201 or tyrosines 1226/7 on Neu is a key event for SLK activation and cell migration, and cancer cell invasion mediated by these tyrosines is inhibited by kinase-inactive SLK. Signaling pathway inhibitors show that Neu-mediated SLK activation is dependent on MEK, PI3K, PLCγ and Shc signaling. Furthermore, heregulin-stimulated SLK activity requires signals from the focal adhesion proteins, FAK and src. Finally, phospho-FAK analysis shows that SLK is required for Neu-dependent focal adhesion turnover. Together, these studies define an interaction between Neu and SLK signaling in the regulation of cancer cell motility."

https://openalex.org/W1965993059,"There is growing interest in the relation between the brain and music. The appealing similarity between brainwaves and the rhythms of music has motivated many scientists to seek a connection between them. A variety of transferring rules has been utilized to convert the brainwaves into music; and most of them are mainly based on spectra feature of EEG.In this study, audibly recognizable scale-free music was deduced from individual Electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms. The translation rules include the direct mapping from the period of an EEG waveform to the duration of a note, the logarithmic mapping of the change of average power of EEG to music intensity according to the Fechner's law, and a scale-free based mapping from the amplitude of EEG to music pitch according to the power law. To show the actual effect, we applied the deduced sonification rules to EEG segments recorded during rapid-eye movement sleep (REM) and slow-wave sleep (SWS). The resulting music is vivid and different between the two mental states; the melody during REM sleep sounds fast and lively, whereas that in SWS sleep is slow and tranquil. 60 volunteers evaluated 25 music pieces, 10 from REM, 10 from SWS and 5 from white noise (WN), 74.3% experienced a happy emotion from REM and felt boring and drowsy when listening to SWS, and the average accuracy for all the music pieces identification is 86.8%(kappa = 0.800, P<0.001). We also applied the method to the EEG data from eyes closed, eyes open and epileptic EEG, and the results showed these mental states can be identified by listeners.The sonification rules may identify the mental states of the brain, which provide a real-time strategy for monitoring brain activities and are potentially useful to neurofeedback therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2086721871,"During postnatal murine and rodent cerebellar development, cerebellar granule precursors (CGP) gradually stop proliferating as they differentiate after migration to the internal granule layer (IGL). Molecular events that govern this program remain to be fully elucidated. GPR3 belongs to a family of Gs-linked receptors that activate cyclic AMP and are abundantly expressed in the adult brain.To investigate the role of this orphan receptor in CGP differentiation, we determined that exogenous GPR3 expression in rat cerebellar granule neurons partially antagonized the proliferative effect of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), while endogenous GPR3 inhibition by siRNA stimulated Shh-induced CGP proliferation. In addition, exogenous GPR3 expression in CGPs correlated with increased p27/kip expression, while GPR3 knock-down led to a decrease in p27/kip expression. In wild-type mice, GPR3 expression increased postnatally and its expression was concentrated in the internal granular layer (IGL). In GPR3 -/- mice, the IGL was widened with increased proliferation of CGPs, as measured by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. Cell cycle kinetics of GPR3-transfected medulloblastoma cells revealed a G0/G1 block, consistent with cell cycle exit.These results thus indicate that GPR3 is a novel antiproliferative mediator of CGPs in the postnatal development of murine cerebellum."
https://openalex.org/W2167305856,"Background Humans can effortlessly segment surfaces and objects from two-dimensional (2D) images that are projections of the 3D world. The projection from 3D to 2D leads partially to occlusions of surfaces depending on their position in depth and on viewpoint. One way for the human visual system to infer monocular depth cues could be to extract and interpret occlusions. It has been suggested that the perception of contour junctions, in particular T-junctions, may be used as cue for occlusion of opaque surfaces. Furthermore, X-junctions could be used to signal occlusion of transparent surfaces. Methodology/Principal Findings In this contribution, we propose a neural model that suggests how surface-related cues for occlusion can be extracted from a 2D luminance image. The approach is based on feedforward and feedback mechanisms found in visual cortical areas V1 and V2. In a first step, contours are completed over time by generating groupings of like-oriented contrasts. Few iterations of feedforward and feedback processing lead to a stable representation of completed contours and at the same time to a suppression of image noise. In a second step, contour junctions are localized and read out from the distributed representation of boundary groupings. Moreover, surface-related junctions are made explicit such that they are evaluated to interact as to generate surface-segmentations in static images. In addition, we compare our extracted junction signals with a standard computer vision approach for junction detection to demonstrate that our approach outperforms simple feedforward computation-based approaches. Conclusions/Significance A model is proposed that uses feedforward and feedback mechanisms to combine contextually relevant features in order to generate consistent boundary groupings of surfaces. Perceptually important junction configurations are robustly extracted from neural representations to signal cues for occlusion and transparency. Unlike previous proposals which treat localized junction configurations as 2D image features, we link them to mechanisms of apparent surface segregation. As a consequence, we demonstrate how junctions can change their perceptual representation depending on the scene context and the spatial configuration of boundary fragments."
https://openalex.org/W1981190526,"To identify dysregulated genes that may play a role in the pathogenesis of tobacco-related human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a cohort of SCCs from smokers (29 SCC of the head and neck, 3 SCC of the esophagus and 46 SCC of the lungs) were concomitantly analyzed for gene expression using Affymetrix U133A 2.0 arrays and for genomic variation using Affymetrix Human Mapping 100 K set. Gene expression profiling clearly separated benign squamous mucosa (BSM) from SCC and identified several candidate genes relevant to the biology of SCC. The single-nucleotide polymorphism array data adapted for copy number analysis identified two discrete areas of high-level genomic amplification, including 7p11.2 (EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)) and 11q13.3 (CCND1 (cyclin D1)). When gene expression measures were correlated with amplification status at 7p11.2 locus, EGFR overexpression in relation to benign tissue was dependent on amplification and occurred in only 9% of cases. However, an adjacent gene (∼0.4 Mb), EGFR-co-amplified and overexpressed protein (ECOP), showed strong over-expression in the majority (90%) of SCCs regardless of gene amplification status. This finding was corroborated with quantitative real-time PCR assays and protein immunoblots. Interestingly, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of ECOP gene products in a SCC cell line (SCC-9) resulted in increased cell death. The results of these studies identify ECOP as a protein relevant to the biology of SCC."
https://openalex.org/W1999253323,"Natural populations of most organisms, especially unicellular microorganisms, are constantly exposed to harsh environmental factors which affect their growth. UV radiation is one of the most important physical parameters which influences yeast growth in nature. Here we used 46 natural strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolated from several natural populations at the ""Evolution Canyon"" microsite (Nahal Oren, Mt. Carmel, Israel). The opposing slopes of this canyon share the same geology, soil, and macroclimate, but they differ in microclimatic conditions. The interslope differences in solar radiation (200%-800% more on the ""African"" slope) caused the development of two distinct biomes. The south-facing slope is sunnier and has xeric, savannoid ""African"" environment while the north-facing slope is represented by temperate, ""European"" forested environment. Here we studied the phenotypic response of the S. cerevisiae strains to UVA and UVC radiations and to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) in order to evaluate the interslope effect on the strains' ability to withstand DNA-damaging agents.We exposed our strains to the different DNA-damaging agents and measured survival by counting colony forming units. The strains from the ""African"" slope were more resilient to both UVA and MMS than the strains from the ""European"" slope. In contrast, we found that there was almost no difference between strains (with similar ploidy) from the opposite slopes, in their sensitivity to UVC radiation. These results suggest that the ""African"" strains are more adapted to higher solar radiation than the ""European"" strains. We also found that the tetraploids strains were more tolerant to all DNA-damaging agents than their neighboring diploid strains, which suggest that high ploidy level might be a mechanism of adaptation to high solar radiation.Our results and the results of parallel studies with several other organisms, suggest that natural selection appears to select, at a microscale, for adaptive complexes that can tolerate the higher UV radiation on the ""African"" slope."
https://openalex.org/W2081458261,"Protein kinases (PKs) have emerged as the largest family of signaling proteins in eukaryotic cells and are involved in every aspect of cellular regulation. Great progresses have been made in understanding the mechanisms of PKs phosphorylating their substrates, but the detailed mechanisms, by which PKs ensure their substrate specificity with their structurally conserved catalytic domains, still have not been adequately understood. Correlated mutation analysis based on large sets of diverse sequence data may provide new insights into this question.Statistical coupling, residue correlation and mutual information analyses along with clustering were applied to analyze the structure-based multiple sequence alignment of the catalytic domains of the Ser/Thr PK family. Two clusters of highly coupled sites were identified. Mapping these positions onto the 3D structure of PK catalytic domain showed that these two groups of positions form two physically close networks. We named these two networks as theta-shaped and gamma-shaped networks, respectively.The theta-shaped network links the active site cleft and the substrate binding regions, and might participate in PKs recognizing and interacting with their substrates. The gamma-shaped network is mainly situated in one side of substrate binding regions, linking the activation loop and the substrate binding regions. It might play a role in supporting the activation loop and substrate binding regions before catalysis, and participate in product releasing after phosphoryl transfer. Our results exhibit significant correlations with experimental observations, and can be used as a guide to further experimental and theoretical studies on the mechanisms of PKs interacting with their substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2026397072,"Background Damage to nerve cells and axons leading to neurodegeneration is a characteristic feature of many neurological diseases. The degree of genetic influence on susceptibility to axotomy-induced neuronal death has so far been unknown. We have examined two gene regions, Vra1 and Vra2, previously linked to nerve cell loss after ventral root avulsion in a rat F2 intercross between the DA and PVG inbred rat strains. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we use two generations (G8 and G10 cohorts) of an advanced intercross line between DA and PVGav1 to reproduce linkage to Vra1 and to fine-map this region. By isolating the effect from Vra1 in congenic strains, we demonstrate that Vra1 significantly regulates the loss of motoneurons after avulsion. The regulatory effect mediated by Vra1 thus resides in a congenic fragment of 9 megabases. Furthermore, we have used the advanced intercross lines to give more support to Vra2, originally detected as a suggestive QTL. Conclusions/Significance The results demonstrated here show that naturally occurring allelic variations affect susceptibility to axotomy-induced nerve cell death. Vra1 and Vra2 represent the first quantitative trait loci regulating this phenotype that are characterized and fine mapped in an advanced intercross line. In addition, congenic strains provide experimental evidence for the Vra1 effect on the extent of injury-induced neurodegeneration. Identification of the underlying genetic variations will increase our understanding of the regulation and mechanisms of neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2079190563,"Background Stochastic fluctuations in the protein turnover underlie the random emergence of neural precursor cells from initially homogenous cell population. If stochastic alteration of the levels in signal transduction networks is sufficient to spontaneously alter a phenotype, can it cause a sporadic chronic disease as well – including cancer? Methods Expression in >80 disease-free tissue environments was measured using Affymetrix microarray platform comprising 54675 probe-sets. Steps were taken to suppress the technical noise inherent to microarray experiment. Next, the integrated expression and expression variability data were aligned with the mechanistic data covering major human chronic diseases. Results Measured as class average, variability of expression of disease associated genes measured in health was higher than variability of random genes for all chronic pathologies. Anti-cancer FDA approved targets were displaying much higher variability as a class compared to random genes. Same held for magnitude of gene expression. The genes known to participate in multiple chronic disorders demonstrated the highest variability. Disease-related gene categories displayed on average more intricate regulation of biological function vs random reference, were enriched in adaptive and transient functions as well as positive feedback relationships. Conclusions A possible causative link can be suggested between normal (healthy) state gene expression variation and inception of major human pathologies, including cancer. Study of variability profiles may lead to novel diagnostic methods, therapies and better drug target prioritization. The results of the study suggest the need to advance personalized therapy development."
https://openalex.org/W1995818841,"The etiology of ovarian cancer is largely unknown. One hypothesis is that the inefficient removal of the blood clots and fibrin products which are deposited in the vicinity of the ovary by retrograde menstruation might be associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms within genes which comprise the fibrinolytic system have been shown to have functional effects on the rate of blood clot degradation. These were considered to be candidate genes in the present study.We studied the genotype distributions of 12 functional SNPs of four genes (tPA, uPA PAI1 and TAFI) among 775 ovarian cancer cases and 889 controls.No significant associations were seen between any of the ten SNPs and the risk of ovarian cancer as a whole, or in any histologic subgroup.Germline known functional variants of genes in the fibrinolytic system are not associated with risk of ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2031506014,"Background Laboratory conditions nullify the extrinsic factors that determine the wild expected lifespan and release the intrinsic or potential lifespan. Thus, wild animals reared in a laboratory often show an increased lifespan, and consequently an increased senescence phase. Senescence is associated with a broad suite of physiological changes, including a decreased responsiveness of the circadian system. The time-keeping hormone melatonin, an important chemical player in this system, is suspected to have an anti-aging role. The Greater White-toothed shrew Crocidura russula is an ideal study model to address questions related to aging and associated changes in biological functions: its lifespan is short and is substantially increased in captivity; daily and seasonal rhythms, while very marked the first year of life, are dramatically altered during the senescence process which starts during the second year. Here we report on an investigation of the effects of melatonin administration on locomotor activity of aging shrews. Methodology/Principal Findings 1) The diel fluctuations of melatonin levels in young, adult and aging shrews were quantified in the pineal gland and plasma. In both, a marked diel rhythm (low diurnal concentration; high nocturnal concentration) was present in young animals but then decreased in adults, and, as a result of a loss in the nocturnal production, was absent in old animals. 2) Daily locomotor activity rhythm was monitored in pre-senescent animals that had received either a subcutaneous melatonin implant, an empty implant or no implant at all. In non-implanted and sham-implanted shrews, the rhythm was well marked in adults. A marked degradation in both period and amplitude, however, started after the age of 14–16 months. This pattern was considerably delayed in melatonin-implanted shrews who maintained the daily rhythm for significantly longer. Conclusions This is the first long term study (>500 days observation of the same individuals) that investigates the effects of continuous melatonin delivery. As such, it sheds new light on the putative anti-aging role of melatonin by demonstrating that continuous melatonin administration delays the onset of senescence. In addition, the shrew appears to be a promising mammalian model for elucidating the precise relationships between melatonin and aging."
https://openalex.org/W2049427840,"The serine/threonine kinase BUB1 (Budding Uninhibited by Benzimidazole 1) was originally identified in yeast as a checkpoint protein, based on its mutant's incapacity of delaying the cell cycle in response to loss of microtubules. Our understanding of its function is primarily from studies carried out in yeast S. cerevisiae. It has been shown that it is a component of the mitotic spindle checkpoint and regulates the separation of sister chromatids through its downstream molecules. However, its roles in multi-cellular organisms remain unclear.In nematode C. elegans, rapid cell divisions primarily occur in embryos and in germline of postembryonic larvae and adults. In addition, a select set of cells undergo a few rounds of cell division postembryonically. One common phenotype associated with impaired cell division is described as Stu (Sterile and Uncoordinated) [1], [2]. We conducted a genetic screen for zygotic mutants that displayed Stu phenotype in C. elegans. We isolated seven Stu mutants that fell into five complementation groups. We report here that two mutations, FanWang5 (fw5) and FanWang8 (fw8) affect the bub-1 gene, a homolog of yeast BUB1. Both mutant alleles of fw5 and fw8 exhibited variable behavioral defects, including developmental arrest, uncoordination and sterility. The number of postembryonically born neurons in the ventral cord decreased and their axon morphology was abnormal. Also, the decrease of neurons in the ventral cord phenotype could not be suppressed by a caspase-3 loss-of-function mutant. In addition, bub-1(fw5 and fw8) mutants showed widespread effects on postembryonic development in many cell lineages. We found that bub-1 functioned maternally in several developmental lineages at the embryonic stage in C. elegans. Studies in yeast have shown that BUB1 functions as a spindle checkpoint protein by regulating the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). We performed double mutant analysis and observed that bub-1 genetically interacted with several downstream genes, including fzy-1/CDC20, mat-2/APC1 and emb-27/APC6.Our results demonstrate a conserved role of bub-1 in cell-cycle regulation and reveal that C. elegans bub-1 is required both maternally and zygotically. Further, our genetic analysis is consistent with that the function of bub-1 in C. elegans is likely similar to its yeast and mammalian homologs."
