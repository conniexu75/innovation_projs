https://openalex.org/W2103379524,"Prostacyclin, a potent, naturally occurring prostaglandin exerts a variety of cardiovascular and cellular actions of potential value in acute myocardial ischemia. These properties include the reduction of systemic blood pressure without changing heart rate, the lowering of coronary vascular and total peripheral resistance, the inhibition of platelet aggregation and the concomitant formation of thromboxane B2, and the reduction of the release of lysosomal enzymes."

A significant improvement in psychotic symptoms occurred after apomorphine compared to placebo. The results are interpreted as a consequence of presynaptic dopamine receptor activation by apomorphine with a subsequent decrease in dopamine-mediated neural transmission."

In a double-blind procedure, intravenous doses of up to 10 milligrams of naloxone hydrochloride in saline were indistinguishable from similarly administered saline alone. There were no effects on subjective pain ratings, finger plethysmograph recordings, or responses to mood-state questionnaires. These laboratory procedures do not activate any functionally significant pain-attenuating or mood-altering effect of endorphins."

https://openalex.org/W1988060281,"A flame retardant used in children's sleepwear, tris-(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (Fyrol FR2) is a mutagen in the Salmonella-mammalian tissue homogenate test after it has been activated by mouse or rat liver homogenate. The expected enzymatic hydrolysis product, 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol, is similarly a mutagen after activation by liver homogenate. A proposed metabolite of the flame retardant, 1,3-dichloro-2-propanone, is a potent mutagen in the absence of such activation. A flame retardant with similar structure, tris-(2,3-dibromopropyl)phosphate (tris-BP), was shown previously to be a mutagen, to cause sterility in animals, to be a carcinogen, and to be absorbed through human skin. These and other flame retardants have characteristic nuclear magnetic resonance spectra that can be used to determine which flame retardant is present in commercially purchased sleepwear. Sleepwear treated with tris-BP, Fyrol FR2, and other chemical additives was being sold in late 1977."

Temperature-sensitive mutants defective in gene cdc24 synthesize chitin at restrictive temperatures, but do not organize it into the discrete rings found in normal cells, nor do they form buds. The chitin ring or an annular precursor structure may play an essential role in reinforcing the region of the cell wall involved in budding."
https://openalex.org/W2055089482,A set of partially overlapping DNA restriction fragments that support promoter-dependent transcription of the tRNA1Tyr gene of Escherichia coli has been used to study site-specific termination in vitro. Transcription termination occurs at a specific site 224–226 nucleotides beyond the end of the structural gene and is completely dependent on ρ-factor. Certain features of this site suggest differences from other termination sites previously studied. A role for specific sequence recognition is suggested.

This demonstrates that there is a viremia in experimental Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. These findings suggest that the hematogenous route may be implicated in the human infection and that the disease may possibly be transmitted by blood transfusions.

https://openalex.org/W2079965230,Gonadotropin-releasing hormone and dopamine were identified simultaneously in the same block of tissue from the median eminence of the rat brain. Two distinct bands of dopamine terminals were found in the lateral median eminence: an inner band which overlapped the gonadotropin-releasing hormone terminals and an outer band which appeared juxtaposed to portal capillaries.

https://openalex.org/W1531702456,"Synthesis of the oligonucleotides that prime replication of phiX174 single-stranded DNA employs complex protein machinery of the host cell which is probably used by the cell to replicate its own chromosome. Primer synthesis depends on at least five proteins (DNA binding protein, dnaB and dnaC proteins, protein i, and protein n) and ATP to form a replication intermediate and another protein, primase (dnaG protein), to assemble the oligonucleotide by template transcription. The data in this paper show that ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates can serve as substrates and form hybrid primers when present together. Both RNA and DNA primers were initiated with ATP. At least three of the four base-pairing nucleoside triphosphates were required for the transcription that generates effective primers. Over 90% of the RNA and DNA transcripts were extended into complementary strands by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. At optimal triphosphate concentrations, the rate and extent of primer formation were greater from ribonucleoside triphosphates than from deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. Uncoupled from DNA replication, the length of RNA primers was 14 to 50 residues, the DNA primers 4 to 20 residues. The fingerprint pattern of an RNase digest of RNA primers has a complexity suggestive of transcription from many sites on the phiX174 template. The multienzyme priming system is highly specific for phiX174 DNA as template."
https://openalex.org/W2035986814,"Longitudinally aligned microtubules, about 220 A in diameter, have been seen in the protoplasmic cylinders of the following spirochetes (symbiotic in the hindguts of dry-wood and subterranean termites): Pillotina sp., Diplocalyx sp., Hollandina sp. They are also present in a gliding bacterium from Pterotermes occidentis. These microtubules are probably composed of tubulin, as determined by staining with fluorescent antibodies to tubulin and comigration with authentic tubulin on acrylamide gels. Treponema reiteri lack tubulin by these same criteria. These observations support the hypothesis of the symbiotic origin of cilia and flagella from certain spirochetes."

https://openalex.org/W165286358,"Thioredoxin was isolated as a phosphoprotein from actively growing cultures of Escherichia coli. Labeling was performed in vivo by growing cells in the presence of 32P-labeled inorganic phosphate, and phosphothioredoxin was purified in one step by immunoabsorption to a thioredoxin antibody column. The stoichiometry of phosphate bound was 0.7 to 0.8 mol of phosphate/mol of thioredoxin. The phospho-amino acid linkage was identified as a thiol phosphate by several criteria: (a) the maximum lability of the phosphate bond was between pH 2.5 and 3.5 (t1/2 (37 degrees) = 200 h (pH 7 to 8); 0.4 h (pH 3.0); 200 h (pH 1.0)); (b) the phosphate linkage was very labile in the presence of iodine at neutral pH (t1/2 less than 1 min); and the phosphopeptide was identified as Cys32-Gly-Pro-Cys35-Lys, the same sequence previously implicated as the active site for disulfide-linked oxidation-reduction reactions. Phosphate was distributed on either cysteine, with 60% of the phosphate bound to cysteine32. Results are discussed in terms of the possible role of phosphothioredoxin as an intermediate in phosphotransferase reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2085612079,"Calcium, other divalent cations, and calcium antagonists were tested for their ability to alter ethanol-induced sleeping time, hypothermia, and behavioral intoxication in mice and rats. Calcium given intraventricularly significantly enhanced sleeping time and behavioral intoxication in a dose-related manner. The ionophores X537A and A23187 accentuated the effect of a low dose of calcium, whereas the calcium chelators EDTA and EGTA decreased sleeping time. Calcium also enhanced tertiary butanol- and chloral hydrate-induced sleeping time. The effects of cations on ethanol-induced hypothermia were less significant. The results suggest the existence of a central calcium pool that is involved in ethanol intoxication in rodents."
https://openalex.org/W1584983848,"Small phospholipid vesicles (liposomes) fuse upon calcium addition as demonstrated by electron microscopy, light absorbance increases, and mixing of original liposome contents within the boundaries of the fused liposome. The integrity of the fusion event is demonstrated by a novel assay based on the luminescence of firefly extract when mixed with ATP. Subsequent addition of valinomycin or the calcium ionophore A23187 leads to further fusion as shown by electron microscopy, light microscopy, and additional absorbance increase. Concomitant with this second absorbance increase is an increase in the amount of calcium that associates with the liposomes. This increased calcium association is more than can be accounted for by equilibration of 5 mM Ca2+ across the membrane and must indicate exposure of extra calcium binding sites. Binding of calcium to the inner side of the membrane may catalyze the second stage of liposome fusion."

https://openalex.org/W1987098570,"Early clinical trials, observational or randomized, hasten the prompt evaluation of new operations. Early clinical surveillance facilitates the design and implementation of randomized clinical trials when they are necessary. Of equal or greater importance, long-term surveillance of operations allows continuing evaluation when their use becomes widespread. Standards, coordination, review, and funding of the evaluation of new operations we believe should be centralized in a single national agency, for which an Institute of Health Care Assessment might be created. Implementation and regulation of the evaluation we believe should remain at the local or regional level with existing mechanisms and agencies being used, such as institutional human research committees and local health systems agencies."

https://openalex.org/W1563103338,"Mutants of Escherichia coli deficient in adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, an enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway for spermidine, were isolated after mutagenesis of E. coli K 12 with N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine or with the bacteriophage Mu. The mutated gene, designated speD, is at 2.7 min on the E. coli chromosome map. In several of the mutants resulting from Mu insertion both adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activity and spermidine were undetectable. The absence of spermidine from speD strains proves the essential role of adenosylmethionine decarboxylase in the biosynthetic pathway for spermidine. Despite the complete absence of spermidine, these mutants grew at 75% of the wild type rate."
https://openalex.org/W1490327212,"The distal region of the tRNA1Tyr gene has been sequenced and found to have an unusual structure. It consists of a 178 base pair sequence that is repeated 3.14 times. The first repeat unit commences 19 base pairs before the end of the sequences encoding the mature tRNA, and these 19 base pairs are repeated faithfully at the beginning of each repeat unit. In the last fractional unit the repeated sequence extends only six base pairs beyond this 19 base pair sequence. Sequence information extends for 62 base pairs beyond the 3.14 repeating units, and no resemblance to the repeating sequence, or any other region of the tRNA1Tyr gene, is found. There are only 14 sites at which one of the repeats differs from the others; 11 of these are transitions, and the rest are transversions. The evolutionary implications of the differences are discussed. One of the differences, which occurs in the second repeat unit, corresponds to the location of the in vitro p-dependent transcription termination site. This is discussed along with other implications of the repeated structure."

The computer's information-handling capabilities allow it to serve as a reliable extension of the physician's memory and expander of the physician's information and synthesized knowledge resources. Computers have been used to facilitate decisions through organization of patient data, improved classification of patients, decision analysis in clinical settings, and simulation of expert clinical reasoning. Computer programs are more successful in narrow, constrained, single arenas of medicine with much underlying pathophysiologic understanding and where decisions are based largely on hard laboratory data. New models of synthetic reasoning that simulate expert clinical behavior show promise of supporting complicated decisions concerning problems of multiple diseases. All systems are confronted by problems of consensus and authority of the underlying information used."

https://openalex.org/W2005779503,The distribution of intracellular myosin was studied by the double antibody immunofluorescence method in primary organotypic neuronal cultures and two established neuronal and glial cell lines. An array of parallel filaments aligned with the major cellular axis and a three-dimensional subsurface network were shown to react with two different myosin antibodies. The presence of myosin-rich filaments in regions known to contain actin filaments suggests that these proteins interact to generate the motive force in nonmuscle contractile systems.

https://openalex.org/W1546150357,"Purified D-alanine carboxypeptidase IA of Escherichia coli is inhibited by penicillin G and binds penicillin G reversibly. The binding of penicillin to the enzyme is relatively insensitive to sulfhydryl reagents, while release of penicillin from the enzyme is severely inhibited by these reagents. The inhibition of release parallels the inhibition of carboxypeptidase activity by the sulfhydryl reagents. In the presence of the sulfhydryl reagent p-chloromercuribenzoate, an acyl-enzyme intermediate, produced by the reaction of carboxypeptidase IA with diacetyl-L-lysyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine, accumulates and can be isolated. These results indicate that binding of penicillin to carboxypeptidase IA occurs by an acylation step of the carboxypeptidase reaction, while penicillin release occurs by a deacylation step of the reaction. Only the latter is inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents."

https://openalex.org/W1487475025,"The mechanism of 3-dehydroquinate synthase was explored by incubating partially purified enzyme with mixtures of [1-14C]3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate (DAHP) and one of the specifically tritiated substrates [4-3H]DAHP, [5-3H]DAHP, [6-3H]DAHP, (7RS)-[7-3H]DAHP, (7R)-[7-3H]DAHP, or (7S)-[7-3H]DAHP. Kinetic and secondary 3H isotope effects were calculated from 3H:14C ratios obtained in unreacted DAHP, 3-dehydroquinate, and 3-dehydroshikimate. 3H was not incorporated from the medium into 3-dehydroquinate, indicating that a carbanion (or methyl group) at C-7 is not formed. A kinetic isotope effect kH/k3H of 1.7 was observed at C-5, and afforded support for a mechanism involving oxidation of C-5 with NAD. A similar kinetic isotope effect was found at C-6 owing to removal of a proton in elimination of phosphate, which is reasonably assumed to be the next step in 3-dehydroquinate synthase. Hydrogen at C-7 of DAHP was not lost in the cyclization step of the reaction, indicating that the enol formed in phosphate elimination participated directly in an aldolase-type reaction with the carbonyl at C-2. In the dehydration of 3-dehydroquinate to 3-dehydroshikimate the (7R) proton from (7RS)- or (7R)-[7-3H]DAHP is lost, indicating that the 7R proton occupies the 2R position in dehydroquinate. Hence the cyclization step occurs with inversion of configuration at C-7. A kinetic isotope effect kH/k3H = 2.3 was observed in the conversion of (2R)-[2-3H]dehydroquinate to dehydroshikimate. Hence loss of a proton from the enzyme-dehydroquinate imine contributed to rate limitation in the reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1750257942,"A method has been devised to test intergenic complementation of mutations in the mitochondrial DNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The test is based on the observation that diploids issued from pairwise crosses of certain mit- mutants with deficiencies in cytochrome oxidase, or coenzyme QH2-cytochrome c reductase, acquire high levels of respiratory activity shortly after zygote formation. Under our experimental conditions neither biochemical complementation, interallelic complementation, nor recombination has been found to contribute to any significant extent toward the respiration measured in the diploids at early times. The test has been used to study the number of complementation groups represented by a large number of mit- mutants. Results of pairwise crosses of mutants in the oxi 1, oxi 2, oxi 3, cob 1, and cob 2 loci indicate that complementation occurs between the oxi and cob loci between different oxi loci but not between the two cob loci. The five loci have, therefore, been assigned to four different complementation groups."

https://openalex.org/W1767452242,"Adenosine 2',3'-riboepoxide 5'-triphosphate (epoxyATP) has been found to be a suicidal inactivator of DNA polymerase I from Escherichia coli by the following criteria. Inactivation is complete, is first order in enzyme activity, and shows saturation kinetics with an apparent KD of 30 +/- 10 micron for epoxy ATP. This KD is comparable to the KM of the substrate dATP. The t1/2 for inactivation is 1.3 min. Inactivation requires Mg2+ and the complementary template. The enzyme is protected by dATP but not by an excess of template. Gel filtration of the reaction mixture after inactivation with [3H]epoxy ATP results in the comigration of E. coli DNA polymerase I, the tritium-labeled inactivator, and the DNA template. The stoichiometry of binding approaches 1 mol of [3H]epoxy nucleotide per mol of inactivated enzyme. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that epoxy ATP initially serves as a substrate for the polymerase reaction, elongating the DNA chain by a nucleotidyl unit, and subsequently alkylates an essential base at the primer terminus binding site of the enzyme. Epoxy ATP also inactivates human and viral DNA polymerases but not E. coli RNA polymerase or rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase. Hence epoxy ATP may be a specific suicide reagent for DNA polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W1652921389,"A major cytochrome b peptide was purified from yeast mitochondria by a procedure involving solubilization in deoxycholic and cholic acids, ammonium sulfate fractionation, proteolytic digestion, and sucrose gradient centrifugation in the presence of Tween 80. The homogeneity of the purified protein was established by the criteria that the product was spectrally pure and yielded a single band on both sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and by gel isoelectric focusing. The purified cytochrome b polypeptide had absorption maxima at 562, 532, and 430 nm in the reduced form and at 525 to 570 nm and 419 nm in the oxidized form. The reduced minus oxidized difference spectra revealed absorption bands at 562, 532, and 430 nm at room temperature and 559, 529, and 429 nm at 77 K, respectively. The heme group was identified as protoheme by formation of the reduced pyridine hemochromogen. Treatment of the reduced form with carbon monoxide affected the absorption spectrum, indicating that the isolated hemoprotein was modified compared to native cytochrome b. The apparent molecular weight of the preparation was 28,000 based on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and 28,800 based on sucrose gradient centrifugation. The isolated cytochrome b polypeptide showed a strong tendency to aggregate."

The results suggest that in MS2 RNA-directed reac- tions, there is a significant amount of misreading in the absence of added aminoacylated tRNA’,““. By the incorpo- ration of P”Slmethionine or PCltyrosine, we estimate this level of misreading to be 15 to 30% of the amount of protein synthesized in samples reconstituted with several Leu- tRNA1,e” isoaccepting species under these conditions. Ex- amination of the synthesis of specific, known peptides spaced throughout the MS2 coat protein further suggests that in the absence of Leu-tRNA’,““, the ribosomes manage to read through the CUC-encoded leucine at position 9 of the MS2 coat protein, and that in the presence of only Leu- tRNA,‘,“’ or both Leu-tRNA?z”, 3 (whose sequenced antico- dons correspond to CUG and CUC codons, respectively), the ribosomes manage to read through the entire coat to the COOH terminus, including reading of the UUA-encoded leucine at position 86 of the MS2 coat. Beyond the endoge- nous misreading level, we have also examined the ability of purified Leu-tRNALel’ isoaccepting species to permit read- through past the first leucine in an “elongation” assay. These results argue that tRNA&& 5 cannot read the CUC- encoded leucine at position 9, while tRNA:,y&, 3 can read this codon"
https://openalex.org/W1514343201,"It has been previously demonstrated in our laboratory that uridine nucleosidase (EC 3.2.2.3) is subjected in yeast to inactivation. An inactivating fraction has been isolated and purified to homogeneity with a procedure which includes gel filtration, adsorption chromatography, and electrofocusing techniques. The molecular weight of the enzyme, estimated either by sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis or by gel filtration is approximately 44,000. No quaternary structure was evidenced. The inactivating activity possesses proteolytic activity against casein and hemoglobin with pH optima of 2.5 and 3.2, respectively. The optimal pH for uridine nucleosidase inactivation is around 4.7. The inactivating activity as well as the proteolytic activity of the preparation can be inhibited by IA but not by IB2 and IC, yeast macromolecular inhibitors for proteinase A (EC 3.4.23.8), B (EC 3.4.22.9), and C (EC 3.4.12.8), respectively. The apparent isoelectric point is pH 4.03. The carbohydrate content is 8.5%. A comparison of the properties of the inactivating protein with those of known yeast proteinases leads to the conclusion that it is identical with the enzyme previously designated as proteinase A, which for the first time has been obtained homogeneous and characterized. It has been shown that proteinase A could play a physiological role in the uridine nucleosidase inactivation process when it is associated, as a complex, with proteinase B."
https://openalex.org/W1586849749,"L-Arabinose isomerase, EC 5.3.1.4, catalyzes the conversion of L-arabinose to L-ribulose, the first step in the catabolism of L-arabinose by Escherichia coli B/r. Patrick and Lee (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 4277--4283) demonstrated that native L-arabinose isomerase is composed of six identical subunits of approximately Mr = 60,000. In this paper we describe an electron microscopy study of the arrangement of the six identical subunits. The isomerase is seen in two distinctly different orientations. The first has three subunits visible, with a 3-fold axis of symmetry, corresponding to a face-on view of two stacked, eclipsed trimers. The second orientation is rectangular in shape with 2-fold symmetry; suggesting a side-on view of the stacked trimers. The six identical subunits are thus arranged with D3 symmetry as in a trigonal prism. Measurements were made on the maximum profile of the three 2-fold axes of symmetry of the face-on orientations, and of both the long and short dimensions of the side-on orientation. The best estimate for the maximum profile of the 2-fold axes of symmetry of the face-on view is 106 +/- 8 A, using glutamine synthetase as an internal size standard. Measurements from micrographs of the isomerase alone, using an external magnification calibration, give the following results: for the maximum profile of the three 2-fold axes of symmetry of the face-on view, 132 +/- 7 A; for the long axis of the side-on view, 136 +/- 10 A; and for the short axis, 105 +/- 6 A. These measurements are consisting with the interpretation of the profiles as representing two different orientations of the L-arabinose isomerase."
https://openalex.org/W1551629870,"Limited digestion of the intact subunit of concanavalin A (Mr = 26,000) with trypsin followed by affinity chromatography on Sephadex G-100 has yielded a highly purified product designated here as Tn-Con A. Chemical studies have shown that Tn-Con A is composed of several components: a large fragment (Tn I, Mr = 19,000) spanning residues 1 to 172, and lower molecular weight polypeptides that are noncovalently associated with Tn I to form the active molecule. The molecular weight of Tn-Con A at pH 7 was 90,000, suggesting that, like native concanavalin A, it was a tetramer at physiological pH. Equilibrium dialysis experiments showed that Tn-Con A bound 1 molecule of alpha-methyl-D-glucoside/22,000 g atoms of protein and therefore that four saccharides are bound by the tetrameric molecule. Tn-Con A and native concanavalin A competed for the same receptors on the lymphocyte surface. Moreover, Tn-Con A was mitogenic for both mouse and human lymphocytes with dose-response curves similar to those of the native lectin. All of these results indicate that tryptic hydrolysis of concanavalin A produces a fragmented molecule retaining the saccharide-binding, subunit association, and mitogenic capacity of the native protein."
https://openalex.org/W1593180623,"The inactivation of the aspartokinase I-homoserine dehydrogenase I by iodoacetic acid and the effect on the sensitivity to its inhibitor, L-threonine, were examined. Both aspartokinase and homoserine dehydrogenase inactivation, as well as the dehydrogenase desensitization toward L-threonine occur as a pseudo-first order process. During its inactivation, the aspartokinase remains sensitive to L-threonine. At 50% inactivation, the inhibition curve of the aspartokinase by L-threonine displays homotropic cooperative effects. This alkylated protein retains eight binding sites for L-threonine. During the carboxymethylation, the protein remains in the tetrameric form until half of the kinase activity is lost. At the end of the inactivation aggregate forms and dimers appear."
