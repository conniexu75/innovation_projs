https://openalex.org/W2059671369,"The immediate-early transcription factor NGFI-A (also called Egr-1, zif/268, or Krox-24) is thought to couple extracellular signals to changes in gene expression. Although activins and inhibins regulate follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) synthesis, no factor has been identified that exclusively regulates luteinizing hormone (LH) synthesis. An analysis of NGFI-A-deficient mice derived from embryonic stem cells demonstrated female infertility that was secondary to LH-beta deficiency. Ovariectomy led to increased amounts of FSH-beta but not LH-beta messenger RNA, which suggested a pituitary defect. A conserved, canonical NGFI-A site in the LH-beta promoter was required for synergistic activation by NGFI-A and steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1). NGFI-A apparently influences female reproductive capacity through its regulation of LH-beta transcription."

One model proposed to explain this activation suggests that receptor tyrosine kinases stimulate a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase whose lipid products directly activate Akt kinase by interacting with its pleckstrin homology domain. In the present study, we show, in three cell types, that Akt does not require its pleckstrin homology domain to respond to either insulin or platelet-derived growth factor. Moreover, attachment of the src myristoylation signal to target Akt, without its pleckstrin homology domain, to the membrane constitutively activates Akt by causing an increase in its basal level of phosphorylation. This constitutively active form of Akt can also activate p70S6K, indicating that the pleckstrin homology domain is not necessary for downstream interactions. Fusion of the inter src homology 2 domain from the p85 regulatory subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to Akt also constitutively activated Akt and induced an association with the lipid kinase. Phosphorylation of this fusion protein still critically contributes toward its increased activity.

Recent studies indicate that Akt functions downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), a lipid kinase that is controlled by receptor tyrosine kinases (1Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O.

Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar). This PI 3-kinase is a heterodimer consisting of a regulatory p85 subunit and a catalytic p110 subunit (5Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Adv. Cell Regul. 1996; 8: 153-158Google Scholar, 6Fry M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1226: 237-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The p85 subunit links p110 to activated tyrosine kinase receptors via its two SH2 domains. It transmits the activating signal to the p110 subunit using the inter SH2 (iSH2) segment that lies between the two SH2 domains. The p110 catalytic subunit mediates the phosphorylation of phosphoinositides (PtdIns) at the 3-position of the inositol ring to generate PtdIns3P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Three different experimental approaches place Akt downstream of PI 3-kinase. First, activation of Akt kinase activity is inhibited by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinases (1Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar, 2Burgering Th, B.M. Coffer P.J.

Second, PDGF receptor mutants that fail to activate PI 3-kinase also fail to activate Akt (1Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar, 2Burgering Th, B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar). Finally, a dominant-negative PI 3-kinase prevents the stimulation of Akt kinase activity by PDGF (2Burgering Th, B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar).Since several independent approaches indicate that Akt functions downstream of PI 3-kinase, a model has been proposed for the mechanism of growth factor stimulation of Akt kinase. First, agonist exposure leads to activation of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase via interaction of the p85 subunit with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (5Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Adv. Cell Regul. 1996; 8: 153-158Google Scholar, 6Fry M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1226: 237-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Second, the activated p110 subunit phosphorylates phosphoinositides on the 3-position of the inositol ring. Subsequently, these lipid products activate Akt. The activated Akt may then regulate the p70 S6 kinase and/or the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (2Burgering Th, B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar, 4Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar).A central question is whether PtdIns 3-phosphates directly or indirectly activate Akt kinase. Franke et al. (1Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar) suggest that the PtdIns 3-phosphates directly activate Akt since PtdIns3P, one of the lipid products generated by PI 3-kinase, can partially activate Akt in vitro. They further propose that the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at the amino terminus of Akt mediates this PI 3-phosphate binding since they found this domain to be essential for PDGF-directed Akt activation in NIH 3T3 cells (1Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar). However, we found the PH domain to be unnecessary for insulin-mediated Akt activation in CHO cells expressing either endogenous levels or overexpressed levels of insulin receptor (3Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). We also could not detect specific binding of PtdIns 3-phosphate to Akt. 2F. Takeuchi, A. Kohn, and R. Roth, unpublished studies. James et al. (7James S.R. Downes C.P. Gigg R. Grove S.J. Homes A.B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) have also recently reported that they could not activate Akt in vitro with PtdIns 3-phosphate. Thus, it is not clear whether PtdIns 3-phosphates directly activate Akt.Burgering and Coffer (2Burgering Th, B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar) propose that Akt is upstream of p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) since a constitutively active Akt increased the activity of p70S6K in the absence of growth factor treatment. The constitutively active version of Akt used in these studies has been previously identified as the transforming component of the AKT8 virus, an acute transforming retrovirus isolated from a rodent T cell lymphoma (8Bellacosa A. Testa J.R. Staal S.P. Tsichlis P.N. Science. 1991; 254: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). In this clone (v-Akt), the Gag polypeptide is fused in-frame to the 5′-untranslated portion of the Akt gene such that all of the Akt coding sequence is retained, including the Akt PH domain. The Gag polypeptide is myristoylated, and it has been shown that fusion of Gag to Akt targets the protein to the membrane (9Ahmed N.N. Franke T.F. Bellacosa A. Datta K. Gonzales-Portal M.-E. Taguchi T. Testa J.R. Tsichlis P.N. Oncogene. 1992; 8: 1957-1963Google Scholar). It is uncertain whether the constitutive activity of Akt fused to Gag is due to the membrane targeting of the kinase or a conformational change induced by Gag. If Gag can alter the conformation of Akt, it could also alter the catalytic specificity of the Akt kinase domain. Furthermore, it is unknown whether Akt requires its PH domain to interact with putative downstream target proteins.In the present study, we show in several cell types that a variant Akt which lacks a PH domain can be activated by either PDGF or insulin. This Akt variant became constitutively active when targeted to the membrane via the addition of the 14-amino acid src myristoylation signal (10Cross F.R. Garber E.A. Pellman D. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1834-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This activation can be attributed to an increase in the level of Akt phosphorylation. This constitutively active form of Akt can stimulate p70S6K in the absence of growth factor treatment, indicating that the PH domain is not required for downstream substrate interactions. We have also constructed another constitutively active mutant of Akt by fusing the iSH2 domain derived from the p85 PI 3-kinase regulatory subunit (11Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hirano M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 12Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) to the amino terminus of Akt. This mutant was found to be associated with a constitutively active PI 3-kinase activity. Phosphorylation of this fusion protein still critically contributes toward its increased enzymatic activity. The sum of these results indicates that phosphorylation is the primary mechanism of Akt kinase activation.CONCLUSIONSIn the present studies, a variant of Akt lacking its PH domain was found to be activated by both insulin and PDGF in three different cell types. These results indicate that the PH domain of Akt is not required for its activation. It is possible that the PH domain of Akt, like the PH domains of other proteins (17Shaw G. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), may under certain conditions play a role in the membrane targeting of Akt. Such a role could explain the requirement for the PH domain of Akt in its activation in some studies (1Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar). Evidence that membrane targeting of Akt plays a role in its activation was confirmed in the present studies by the finding that the addition of the src myristoylation signal to Akt resulted in constitutive activation of the enzyme. This activation, like that observed with insulin and PDGF, was again due to an increase in the Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the enzyme and did not require the PH domain, thereby giving rise to the hypothesis that a membrane-associated Ser/Thr kinase is responsible for the activation of Akt. The finding that the constitutively active Akt could stimulate the enzymatic activity of the 70-kDa S6 kinase indicates that the PH domain of Akt is also not required for its interaction with at least one of its downstream targets.

Second, PDGF receptor mutants that fail to activate PI 3-kinase also fail to activate Akt (1Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N.

Finally, a dominant-negative PI 3-kinase prevents the stimulation of Akt kinase activity by PDGF (2Burgering Th, B.M. Coffer P.J.

Since several independent approaches indicate that Akt functions downstream of PI 3-kinase, a model has been proposed for the mechanism of growth factor stimulation of Akt kinase. First, agonist exposure leads to activation of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase via interaction of the p85 subunit with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (5Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Adv. Cell Regul. 1996; 8: 153-158Google Scholar, 6Fry M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1226: 237-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Second, the activated p110 subunit phosphorylates phosphoinositides on the 3-position of the inositol ring. Subsequently, these lipid products activate Akt. The activated Akt may then regulate the p70 S6 kinase and/or the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (2Burgering Th, B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar, 4Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar). A central question is whether PtdIns 3-phosphates directly or indirectly activate Akt kinase. Franke et al. (1Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar) suggest that the PtdIns 3-phosphates directly activate Akt since PtdIns3P, one of the lipid products generated by PI 3-kinase, can partially activate Akt in vitro. They further propose that the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at the amino terminus of Akt mediates this PI 3-phosphate binding since they found this domain to be essential for PDGF-directed Akt activation in NIH 3T3 cells (1Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar). However, we found the PH domain to be unnecessary for insulin-mediated Akt activation in CHO cells expressing either endogenous levels or overexpressed levels of insulin receptor (3Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). We also could not detect specific binding of PtdIns 3-phosphate to Akt. 2F. Takeuchi, A. Kohn, and R. Roth, unpublished studies. James et al. (7James S.R. Downes C.P. Gigg R. Grove S.J. Homes A.B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) have also recently reported that they could not activate Akt in vitro with PtdIns 3-phosphate. Thus, it is not clear whether PtdIns 3-phosphates directly activate Akt. Burgering and Coffer (2Burgering Th, B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar) propose that Akt is upstream of p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) since a constitutively active Akt increased the activity of p70S6K in the absence of growth factor treatment. The constitutively active version of Akt used in these studies has been previously identified as the transforming component of the AKT8 virus, an acute transforming retrovirus isolated from a rodent T cell lymphoma (8Bellacosa A. Testa J.R. Staal S.P. Tsichlis P.N. Science. 1991; 254: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). In this clone (v-Akt), the Gag polypeptide is fused in-frame to the 5′-untranslated portion of the Akt gene such that all of the Akt coding sequence is retained, including the Akt PH domain. The Gag polypeptide is myristoylated, and it has been shown that fusion of Gag to Akt targets the protein to the membrane (9Ahmed N.N. Franke T.F. Bellacosa A. Datta K. Gonzales-Portal M.-E. Taguchi T. Testa J.R. Tsichlis P.N. Oncogene. 1992; 8: 1957-1963Google Scholar). It is uncertain whether the constitutive activity of Akt fused to Gag is due to the membrane targeting of the kinase or a conformational change induced by Gag. If Gag can alter the conformation of Akt, it could also alter the catalytic specificity of the Akt kinase domain. Furthermore, it is unknown whether Akt requires its PH domain to interact with putative downstream target proteins. In the present study, we show in several cell types that a variant Akt which lacks a PH domain can be activated by either PDGF or insulin. This Akt variant became constitutively active when targeted to the membrane via the addition of the 14-amino acid src myristoylation signal (10Cross F.R. Garber E.A. Pellman D. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1834-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This activation can be attributed to an increase in the level of Akt phosphorylation. This constitutively active form of Akt can stimulate p70S6K in the absence of growth factor treatment, indicating that the PH domain is not required for downstream substrate interactions. We have also constructed another constitutively active mutant of Akt by fusing the iSH2 domain derived from the p85 PI 3-kinase regulatory subunit (11Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hirano M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 12Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) to the amino terminus of Akt. This mutant was found to be associated with a constitutively active PI 3-kinase activity. Phosphorylation of this fusion protein still critically contributes toward its increased enzymatic activity. The sum of these results indicates that phosphorylation is the primary mechanism of Akt kinase activation. CONCLUSIONSIn the present studies, a variant of Akt lacking its PH domain was found to be activated by both insulin and PDGF in three different cell types. These results indicate that the PH domain of Akt is not required for its activation. It is possible that the PH domain of Akt, like the PH domains of other proteins (17Shaw G. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), may under certain conditions play a role in the membrane targeting of Akt. Such a role could explain the requirement for the PH domain of Akt in its activation in some studies (1Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar). Evidence that membrane targeting of Akt plays a role in its activation was confirmed in the present studies by the finding that the addition of the src myristoylation signal to Akt resulted in constitutive activation of the enzyme. This activation, like that observed with insulin and PDGF, was again due to an increase in the Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the enzyme and did not require the PH domain, thereby giving rise to the hypothesis that a membrane-associated Ser/Thr kinase is responsible for the activation of Akt. The finding that the constitutively active Akt could stimulate the enzymatic activity of the 70-kDa S6 kinase indicates that the PH domain of Akt is also not required for its interaction with at least one of its downstream targets.

The B subunits determine the substrate specificity of the enzyme. There have been three families of cellular B subunits identified to date: B55, B56 (B'), and PR72/130. We have now cloned five genes encoding human B56 isoforms. Polypeptides encoded by all but one splice variant (B56gamma1) are phosphoproteins, as shown by mobility shift after treatment with alkaline phosphatase and metabolic labeling with [32P]phosphate. All labeled isoforms contain solely phosphoserine. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrates distinct patterns of intracellular targeting by different B56 isoforms. Specifically, B56alpha, B56beta, and B56epsilon complexed with the protein phosphatase 2A A and C subunits localize to the cytoplasm, whereas B56delta, B56gamma1, and B56gamma3 are concentrated in the nucleus. Two isoforms (B56beta and B56delta) are highly expressed in adult brain; here we show that mRNA for these isoforms increases severalfold when neuroblastoma cell lines are induced to differentiate by retinoic acid treatment. These studies demonstrate an increasing diversity of regulatory mechanisms to control the activity of this key intracellular protein phosphatase and suggest distinct functions for isoforms targeted to different intracellular locations."

INTRODUCTIONCellular responses to agonists of G-protein-coupled receptors are rapidly attenuated in the continuous presence of agonist and desensitize to repeated application of agonist (1Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 2Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). With time between challenges, responses recover and cells resensitize. These are important processes, since they determine the ability of cells to respond to agonists; desensitization prevents the uncontrolled stimulation of cells, whereas resensitization allows cells to recover or maintain their responsiveness. Desensitization and resensitization are controlled at the level of the receptors and at more distal steps in the signaling pathway, but regulation of the receptors is of critical importance. The mechanisms may be distinct for different classes of G-protein-coupled receptors. Receptors for hormones and neurotransmitters, exemplified by the β2AR 1The abbreviations used are: β2-ARβ2-adrenergic receptorPAR-2proteinase-activated receptor-2Th-Rthrombin receptorNK1-Rneurokinin 1 receptorAPactivating peptidePKCprotein kinase CPKAprotein kinase AGRKG-protein receptor kinaseKNRKsarcoma virus transformed rat kidney epithelial cellsPDBuphorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. and the NK1-R, bind agonists reversibly and desensitize in a reversible manner. The reuse of these receptor molecules mediates resensitization of cellular responses (3von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 438-446PubMed Google Scholar). Receptors for proteases, such as the Th-R, are cleaved to expose a tethered ligand that binds and activates the receptor in an irreversible manner (6Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar). This generates a quantum of signal that is rapidly attenuated or desensitized despite the irreversible mechanism of activation (7Ishii K. Hein L. Kobilka B. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9780-9786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Resensitization of cellular responses to thrombin requires the availability of new receptor molecules (8Hein L. Ishii K.

For example, GRKs and second messenger kinases (PKA) phosphorylate the β2-AR. β-Arrestin binds to the phosphorylated receptor, disrupts interaction with G-proteins, and terminates the signal. The NK1-R and the Th-R both desensitize by this mechanism (5Garland A.M. Grady E.F. Lovett M. Vigna S.R. Frucht M.M. Krause J.E. Bunnett N.W. Mol.

PAR-2 is highly expressed in the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract, where it may be activated by pancreatic trypsin, and in certain tumor cells, where it may respond to tumor-associated trypsins (17Nystedt S.

These include the inhibition of pancreatic secretion by a negative feedback mechanism (21Fushiki T. Iwai K.

Activation of PAR-2 also directly stimulates amylase secretion from pancreatic acini, stimulates contraction of gastric muscle, and inhibits tumor cell growth (20Bühm S. Kong W. Brümme D.

The mechanisms of desensitization and resensitization of these effects are completely unexplored but are likely to be of considerable importance in the intestine, where cells are episodically exposed to trypsin during feeding and fasting (24Solomon T.E. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1499-1530Google Scholar). Furthermore, the duration of the signal may be of importance in determining other effects of PAR-2, such as regulation of cell growth.The aim of this investigation was to delineate the mechanisms of desensitization and resensitization of PAR-2 in transfected kidney epithelial cells and in hBRIE 380 cells, a highly differentiated cell line derived from the intestinal epithelium that naturally expresses PAR-2. We (a) characterized PAR-2-mediated Ca2+ mobilization, (b) examined cleavage of PAR-2 by trypsin, (c) investigated homologous desensitization to repeated activation of PAR-2, (d) determined the role of PKC in attenuating Ca2+ responses, (e) examined internalization and targeting of activated PAR-2, and (f) studied the mechanism of resensitization of Ca2+ mobilization.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe mechanisms of desensitization and resensitization of PAR-2-mediated responses are completely unexplored but are of considerable general interest given the unusual mechanism of irreversible activation of this receptor. It is important to understand these processes since desensitization of PAR-2 will prevent the uncontrolled stimulation of cells by trypsin, and resensitization is necessary for cells to recover their ability to respond to trypsin. Thus, the physiological effects of trypsin that are mediated by PAR-2, which may include regulation of pancreatic secretion, hormone secretion, smooth muscle contraction, and growth (20Bühm S.

Furthermore, the duration of the signal to trypsin may be an important determinant of long-term effects of trypsin, including effects on cell growth (12Vouret-Craviari V. Auberger P. Pouysságur J.

Therefore, we examined the mechanism of desensitization and resensitization of cells expressing PAR-2 to trypsin and AP.We studied these processes in two epithelial cell lines, KNRK cells transfected with human PAR-2 and hBRIE 380 cells that naturally express PAR-2. KNRK cells were chosen because we have previously investigated the mechanisms of desensitization and resensitization of the NK1-R expressed in these cells (4Grady E.F. Garland A.G. Gamp P.D.

However, observations of transfected cells may be unique to the cell line or be artifacts of receptor overexpression. Thus, we also studied hBRIE 380 cells, a highly differentiated, polarized cell line derived from the intestinal epithelium (26Aponte G.W. Keddie A. Hallden G. Hess R. Link P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5282-5286Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 27Hallden G. Holehouse E.L. Dong X. Aponte G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G730-G743PubMed Google Scholar). This line naturally expresses PAR-2 (20Bühm S. Kong W. Brümme D. Smeekens S.P. Anderson D.C. Connolly A. Kahn M. Nelken N.A. Coughlin S. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and closely resembles epithelial cells of the small intestine. From a physiological standpoint, it is important to study desensitization and resensitization of PAR-2 in intestinal epithelial cells, since they are episodically exposed to trypsin during feeding and fasting (24Solomon T.E. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1499-1530Google Scholar).PAR-2 Mobilizes Intracellular Ca2+ and Stimulates Ca2+ Influx from Extracellular FluidWe examined the effects of PAR-2 activation by trypsin or AP on [Ca2+]i, measured using Fura-2/AM. Trypsin and AP stimulated an increase in [Ca2+]i in KNRK-PAR-2 cells (Fig. 1, A and B), although trypsin was 7,800-fold more potent than AP (EC50 trypsin = 2.3 nM, AP = 18 µM). Similarly, trypsin and AP increased [Ca2+]i in hBRIE 380 cells (Fig. 1, C and D) (EC50 of trypsin = 25.3 nM, EC50 of AP = 17.0 µM). For both cell lines, the Ca2+ response was biphasic, with a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i, and a slower decline to a sustained plateau.To determine which phase of this response was due to mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and which phase depended on entry of extracellular Ca2+, we loaded cells with Fura-2/AM and studied them in Ca2+-free medium. In KNRK-PAR-2 cells, 100 nM trypsin stimulated a prompt increase in [Ca2+]i, which rapidly declined to basal levels (Fig. 2A). When Ca2+ was added back to the medium to a final concentration of 2 mM, 1 min after exposure to agonist, [Ca2+]i again increased for an extended plateau phase (Fig. 2B). In hBRIE 380 cells, the response to 100 nM trypsin also rapidly declined in Ca2+-free medium. In contrast to KNRK cells, the plateau was not completely abolished but just diminished. When Ca2+ was replenished, [Ca2+]i again increased to establish a plateau phase similar to control cells (Fig. 2, D and E). Similar results were obtained with 100 µM AP in both cell lines (not shown).Fig. 2Effects of trypsin (T) and AP on [Ca2+]i in KNRK-PAR-2 cells (A-C) and hBRIE 380 cells (D-F). Cells were placed in a spectrofluorometer in Ca2+-free medium. Trypsin (100 nM) or AP (100 µM) was added (arrows). A and D show control cells in Ca2+-free medium. B and E show cells in Ca2+-free medium to which Ca2+ was added (arrowheads) to give a concentration of 2 mM in the extracellular fluid. C and F show cells treated with 10 µM SK&F 96365 and placed in Ca2+-free medium to which Ca2+ was added (arrowheads) to give a concentration of 2 mM in the extracellular fluid. Results are representative traces from three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We used inhibitors to characterize the channel in the plasma membrane of KNRK-PAR-2 cells and hBRIE 380 cells that was responsible for the influx of extracellular Ca2+. Treatment of cells with 10 µM amiloride or 10 µM nifedipine to inhibit voltage-sensitive N- and L-type channels, respectively, had no effect on the influx of Ca2+ (not shown). However, treatment with 10 µM SK&F 96365, which blocks the ICRAC channel, abolished the influx in both cell lines (Fig. 2, C and F).The results show that the prompt increase in [Ca2+]i that follows activation of PAR-2 is due to release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, since it was still observed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. This phase of the response is rapidly attenuated despite the irreversible nature of PAR-2 activation. The extent of the plateau phase and the mechanism of its generation are dependent on the cell type. In KNRK-PAR-2 cells the plateau phase depends completely on the influx of extracellular Ca2+, whereas in hBRIE 380 cells it was only diminished in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. This indicates that in hBRIE 380 cells, in addition to influx of extracellular Ca2+, continued Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores must contribute to the plateau phase. The influx of extracellular Ca2+ is triggered by depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores, which activates the “Ca2+ release-activated current” through the putative ICRAC channel that is inhibited by SK&F 96365 (31Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). Ca2+ entry from the extracellular fluid in response to PAR-2 activation uses the SK&F 96365-sensitive ICRAC channel in both cell lines. Thus, PAR-2 is similar to the neurokinin 1 and 2 receptors, which respond to agonists by both mobilizing intracellular Ca2+ and by opening a channel in the plasma membrane that is sensitive to SK&F 96395 (5Garland A.M. Grady E.F. Lovett M. Vigna S.R. Frucht M.M. Krause J.E. Bunnett N.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 438-446PubMed Google Scholar). The influx of Ca2+ from extracellular fluid is an important component of signal transduction, since Ca2+ influx refills the intracellular stores, modulates the spatiotemporal pattern of propagation of Ca2+ waves, and is necessary for secretion of mediators from some cells. Furthermore, the duration of signal generation by growth factors may be a critical element in determining cell cycle reentry (12Vouret-Craviari V. Auberger P. Pouysságur J. Van ObberghenSchilling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4813-4821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 38Parekh A.B. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7907-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This may be important for PAR-2, since hBRIE 380 cells and A549 cells (lung adenocarcinoma), which naturally express PAR-2, exhibit prolonged Ca2+ responses to trypsin and AP, and because PAR-2 activation inhibits growth of A549 cells (20Bühm S. Kong W. Brümme D. Smeekens S.P. Anderson D.C. Connolly A. Kahn M. Nelken N.A. Coughlin S. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar).Trypsin and AP Induce Homologous Desensitization of PAR-2Desensitization is the diminution of a biological response to repeated exposure to agonist or to continued presence of agonist. Cellular responses to trypsin that are mediated by PAR-2 could desensitize by (a) enzymatic cleavage of the receptor, which ensures that a single receptor molecule, once cleaved, cannot be reactivated by trypsin; (b) receptor phosphorylation and uncoupling from G-proteins; and (c) inhibition of more distal steps of intracellular signaling. In contrast, AP activates PAR-2 without receptor cleavage, so that responses to AP could desensitize by uncoupling from G-proteins and inhibition of later stages of signaling. To compare desensitization of PAR-2 with trypsin and AP, we measured Ca2+ responses to repeated application of both trypsin and AP.We examined desensitization of PAR-2 by exposing KNRK-PAR-2 cells or hBRIE 380 cells sequentially to 100 nM trypsin or 100 µM AP at 2-min intervals, without an intervening wash. In KNRK-PAR-2 cells, trypsin reduced or abolished the Ca2+ response to a second exposure to trypsin or AP given 2 min later (Fig. 3, A and B, Table I). AP substantially reduced, but did not abolish, the Ca2+ response to a second exposure to AP but did not affect the response to trypsin. In hBRIE 380 cells, trypsin abolished the response to a second exposure to trypsin and AP (Fig. 4, A and B, Table I). AP abolished the response to a second exposure to AP and markedly inhibited the response to trypsin. Thus, activation of PAR-2 by trypsin or AP induces homologous desensitization of the Ca2+ response. Trypsin causes a more substantial desensitization, especially in KNRK-PAR-2 cells.Fig. 3Desensitization of the Ca2+ response in KNRK-PAR-2 cells. Cells were challenged with 100 nM trypsin (T) (A), 100 µM AP (B), or 1 µM bradykinin (BK) (C).

We investigated whether activation of PAR-2 with trypsin or AP caused heterologous desensitization of responses to bradykinin by exposing cells to 100 nM trypsin, 100 µM AP, or carrier (control) and then challenging them with a test dose of 1 µM bradykinin 2 min later. In both cell lines, trypsin and AP slightly reduced the response to bradykinin (Fig. 3, A and B, Fig. 4, A and C, Table I), although this was statistically significant only for the hBRIE 380 cells. Thus, activation of PAR-2 may cause heterologous desensitization of bradykinin responses in hBRIE 380 cells. However, the Ca2+ response to bradykinin in hBRIE 380 cells was <10% of that in KNRK-PAR-2 cells, suggesting that hBRIE 380 cells have fewer receptors. This may explain the difference in desensitization of the bradykinin response in these cells lines by trypsin and AP. The intracellular Ca2+ stores were not substantially depleted by trypsin or AP, since bradykinin was still able to mobilize Ca2+. This suggests that homologous desensitization of the Ca2+ response to trypsin and AP is not principally due to depletion of these pools, although some diminution of available stores could contribute to desensitization.In a similar manner, we examined whether bradykinin desensitized subsequent Ca2+ responses to bradykinin, trypsin, or AP. In KNRK-PAR-2 cells and hBRIE 380 cells, 1 µM bradykinin abolished the response to 1 µM bradykinin, applied 2 min later (Fig. 3C, Fig. 4C, Table I). Bradykinin reduced, but did not abolish, the response to 100 nM trypsin or 100 µM AP. Therefore, the bradykinin response shows pronounced homologous desensitization and causes moderate heterologous desensitization of PAR-2.Together, our results show that repeated application of trypsin or AP causes marked homologous desensitization of PAR-2. Desensitization mainly occurs due to specific alteration of the receptor rather than depletion of intracellular mediators, because bradykinin was still capable of mobilizing Ca2+. Trypsin causes a larger desensitization of PAR-2 than AP, although the magnitude of the Ca2+ response to both agonists is generally similar. This is expected since trypsin, but not AP, cleaves PAR-2, which ensures that a single receptor molecule, once cleaved, cannot respond again to trypsin. We determined the rate of this cleavage by measuring loss of Flag immunoreactivity from the cell surface.Trypsin and AP Induce Loss of PAR-2 from the Cell SurfaceWe quantified Flag i"

Another remarkable property of PACAP1-R is the difference in the potencies of PACAP-38 and -27 in AC and PLC activation.

Rands E. Diehl R.E. Mumford R.A. Slater E.E. Sigal I.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Strader C.D. Nature. 1986; 321: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar), numerous studies have addressed the importance of the different receptor domains in G protein activation and ligand binding (reviewed in Ref. 25Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). PACAP1-R belongs to the VIP-secretin-glucagon-calcitonin receptor family. These receptors share good homologies with each other but not with other members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. At present, few structure-function studies have been performed on members of this family. Available data involve the extracellular domains of this family of receptors in ligand binding. For instance, two alternatively spliced forms of the rat calcitonin receptor were characterized. The C1b isoform displays a 37-amino acid insertion in the first extracellular loop as compared with the C1a isoform. The presence of this insertion induces a 40-fold reduction in affinity for the iodinated calcitonin, indicating that this domain is crucial for high affinity calcitonin binding (26Houssami S. Findlay D.M. Brady C.L. Myers D.E. Martin T.J. Sexton P.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, experiments with chimeric receptors suggested a role for the N-terminal extracellular domain of the calcitonin receptor in calcitonin binding (27Stroop S.D. Kuestner R.E. Serwold T.F. Chen L. Moore E.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1050-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Similarly, it was demonstrated that the extracellular N-terminal domain of PACAP/VIP1-R is critical for VIP binding (28Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14394-14398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 29Vilardaga J.-P. De Neef P. Di Paolo E. Bollen A. Waelbroeck M. Robberecht P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutation of some residues conserved among the PACAP-VIP-secretin-glucagon receptor family (cysteine 63, aspartate 68, cysteine 72, tryptophan 73, cysteine 86, glycine 109) completely abolished VIP binding (30Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Maoret J.-J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 31Gaudin P. Couvineau A. Maoret J.-J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This domain (residues 63-109) is therefore likely to interact with VIP. The authors have not assessed whether PACAP binding is also altered by the same mutations, and it is therefore not known whether the same domain also interacts with PACAP. Regarding the PACAP1-R, Cao and co-workers (32Cao Y.-J. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the N-terminal extracellular and the first transmembrane domains are sufficient to confer high affinity PACAP binding. Interestingly, the PACAP1-R displays a 21-aa sequence in the N-terminal extracellular domain, which has no homologous domain in any other member of the VIP-secretin-glucagon receptor family. The present study established the existence of a new splice variant missing the above mentioned 21 aa and described its functional properties regarding binding and activation of AC and PLC. A genomic library (a generous gift from Dr. Philippe Soriano, Seattle) was constructed by partial digestion of genomic DNA from 129/Sv mouse strain with MboI and subcloning of the digested fragments into λDashII (Stratagene). We screened 1.9 × 106 clones with a random primed probe derived from the rat PACAP1-R cDNA (1Miyata A. Arimura A. Dahl R.R. Minamino N. Uehara A. Jiang L. Culler M.D. Coy D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar) and isolated 18 positive clones. Clone λD3313 containing exons 5, 6, and 7 was digested with NcoI, the resulting fragments were subcloned into pGEM5zf(+) (Promega), and the exon-intron boundaries were sequenced using T7 DNA polymerase (Pharmacia). To determine the sequence of the junction between exon 4 and the 3′ intron, we performed three independent PCRs on mouse genomic DNA using primers derived from the sequence of exon 4, i.e. 5′-TCACATGTTGGAAGCCTGCTC-3′, and from the 5′-terminal sequence of λD3313, i.e. 5′-TGGATAGAAAGTCAAGGATGG-3′. The resulting 1.5-kilobase product was directly sequenced with a nested primer, 5′-GGTGAGATGGTCCTTGTGAGC-3′, using the fmol Sequence System (Promega). A human fetal (5-month-old abortion) brain cDNA library was constructed in λ Zap II (a generous gift from Dr. Peter J. Flor, Ciba-Geigy, Basel, Switzerland). We screened 1.2 × 106 clones with a random primed probe derived from the rat PACAP1-R cDNA and isolated seven positives clones, which were excised with helper phage and sequenced as above. Full-length cDNAs were reconstructed using RT-PCR and restriction enzymes and subcloned into pRK5, a cytomegalovirus-based expression vector (33Schall T.J. Lewis M. Koller K.J. Lee A. Rice G.C.

All clones were sequenced on both strands as above. Total RNA were isolated from various mouse tissues using standard protocol (34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) and were reverse transcribed using MoMuLV-RT (Life Technologies, Inc.) and random hexamers. Primers flanking the V89-T109 region of the mouse PACAP1-R were designed to carry out PCR experiments (upper, 5′-ATGAGTCTTCCCCAGGTTG; lower, 5′-ACCGACAGGTAGTAATAATCC). PCR was performed using the following conditions: 94°C/1 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation (94°C/30 s), annealing (54°C/30 s), and elongation (72°C/30 s). The expected size of the PCR fragments was 315 bp for PACAP1-R s, hip, hop1, hop2, hiphop1, and hiphop2 and 252 bp for PACAP1-R vs. LLC PK1 (a generous gift from Dr. Falk Fahrenholz, Max Planck Institut für Biophysik, Frankfurt, Germany) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, resuspended in EP1x buffer (50 mM K2HPO4, 20 mM CH3CO2K, 20 mM KOH, 26.7 mM MgSO4, pH 7.4, with CH3C02H) and mixed with plasmid DNA. After 15 min at room temperature, 300 µl of cell suspension were transferred to a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad) and pulsed using a Gene pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) set at 960 microfarads/260 V. Cells were immediately transferred to a tube, diluted with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and plated at the desired density. PACAP-27 was iodinated using the iodogene method. Briefly, 4 nmol of PACAP-27 were mixed with 1 mCi [125I]NaI in phosphate buffer, pH 7.1, in tubes precoated with 15 µg of iodogene. After 10 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 400 µl of 18% acetonitrile in 0.07% trifluoroacetic acid. Iodinated PACAP-27 was subsequently purified by two successive runs of high pressure liquid chromatography on a 50734 µsphere 100RP18 Ncapt column (Merck) using a gradient of acetonitrile (18-48% in 0.07% trifluoroacetic acid). The purified iodinated peptide was diluted in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and stored at -70°C. All binding experiments were performed on intact cells at 4°C. [125I]PACAP-27 was diluted at the desired concentrations in HBS buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 4.2 mM KCl, 0.9 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% glucose, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and transfected cells were incubated for 4 h at 4°C with the different dilutions. At the end of the incubation period, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. 500 µl of 0.5 M NaOH was added to solubilize the cells, and radioactivity was measured using a γ-counter (Kontron). Data were analyzed with the EBDA-Ligand software. Cells were cotransfected with a plasmid carrying a cAMP-regulated reporter luciferase cDNA (pΔMC16-Luc) (18Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). Cells were washed and incubated overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal bovine serum. PACAP-27 and -38 were added for 4 h before cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined by luminometry. Data were fitted to a four-parameter logistic equation to obtain response parameter (EC50, Emax, nH) with the Kaleidagraph software. Student's t test was performed with Statview software. Transfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated overnight with 1 µCi of myo[3H]inositol in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal bovine serum. Medium was aspirated, and cells were incubated in HBS, 10 mM LiCl for 10 min at 37°C. 10-fold concentrated PACAP-27 or -38 dilutions were added, and the incubation was continued for a further 30 min. Medium was aspirated, and the reaction was stopped with 1 ml of 5% perchloric acid. Levels of inositol phosphate were determined as described previously (35Colson P. Ibarondo J. Devilliers G. Balestre M.-N. Duvoid A. Guillon G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E1054-E1062PubMed Google Scholar), and data were fitted to a four-parameter logistic equation to obtain response parameter (EC50, Emax, nH) with the Kaleidagraph software. Student's t test was performed with Statview software. Using the rat PACAP1-R cDNA as a probe, we isolated several genomic clones encoding the mouse PACAP1-R gene. It is composed of at least 18 exons and spans more than 50 kilobases. Analysis of the exon-intron structure indicated that two separate exons encode a 21-aa sequence that is specific to PACAP1-R as compared with other members of the VIP-secretin-glucagon receptor family of G protein-coupled receptors (Fig. 1). In addition, splicing out of these exons would keep the reading frame and generate a shorter form of PACAP1-R missing the 21-aa in the N-terminal extracellular domain. To test whether such a splice variant may exist, we designed oligonucleotides flanking the 21-aa domain and performed RT-PCR on total RNA from various mouse tissues. In all tissues expressing PACAP1-R, we evidenced a major band corresponding to the size expected for the known PACAP1-R sequence (Fig. 2). In addition, the hypothalamus/thalamus and pituitary and adrenal glands displayed an additional band, the size of which was compatible with the deletion of 63 bp (Fig. 2). To establish the identity of this band, we isolated and subcloned both PCR fragments into pBlueScript and sequenced both strands using T3, T7, as well as internal primers. The sequences of these bands were identical except for the absence in the shortest fragment of 63 bp encoding the above mentioned 21-aa domain (data not shown). This demonstrates the existence of a previously uncharacterized splice variant of the N-terminal extracellular domain of the PACAP1-R. To isolate a full-length cDNA encoding the new splice variant and to characterize its functional properties, we screened a fetal brain cDNA library. We chose a human library for use of the isolated clones in future pharmacological studies. We isolated seven independent clones encoding the human PACAP1-R. Most of these were partial clones, and several contained unspliced introns. Clone C19 contained the entire coding region and was the human homologue of the rat PACAP1-R s (18Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar) (94% homology). This sequence was identical to the sequence published by Ogi and co-workers (36Ogi K. Miyamoto Y. Masuda Y. Habata Y. Hosoya M. Ohtaki T. Masuo Y. Onda H. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1511-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) except in the 5′ region. These authors found a long repeat in the 5′-coding and non-coding regions that has no homologous sequence in the rat PACAP1-R. The sequence we found did not display this repeated sequence and was strictly homologous to the PACAP1-R sequences already published. The clone described by Ogi and co-workers (36Ogi K. Miyamoto Y. Masuda Y. Habata Y. Hosoya M. Ohtaki T. Masuo Y. Onda H. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1511-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) was therefore likely to result from rearrangement in the 5′ region of their cDNA. The other clones we isolated were partial and corresponded to human homologues of the rat hip, hop1, and hop2 splice variants. This demonstrated that alternative splicing of the region encoding the third intracellular loop of PACAP1-R also occurred in human, at least in fetal brain. In addition, clone C24 started at codon encoding N60 and was otherwise identical to clone C19 in the coding region but for the deletion of the sequence encoding V89 to S109 in the putative extracellular N-terminal domain. Two additional clones displayed the same deletion. These results indicated that alternative splicing of the region encoding V89-S109 also occurred in human fetal brain. Using PCR and restriction enzymes, we reconstructed the human PACAP1-R hip and hop1 splice variants as well as the new variant. Since this latter variant was shorter than the variant referred as “s” (short), we named it “vs” for “very short” (Fig. 1). All reconstructed clones were entirely sequenced on both strands (data not shown) and subsequently subcloned into pRK5, a cytomegalovirus-based expression vector. We transiently transfected LLC PK1 cells by electroporation and performed binding experiments and second messenger measurements on intact cells to characterize the functional properties of PACAP1-R vs as compared with those of PACAP1-R s. We used a dose of each plasmid, which resulted in expression of approximately 5000 receptors per cell. Scatchard plots on intact transfected cells were determined for each experiment to verify that both variants were expressed at similar densities at the cell surface. Saturation experiments with [125I]PACAP-27 indicated that the dissociation constant (KD) was affected only 2-fold by the presence of the 21-aa domain (PACAP1-R s, 0.31 ± 0.03 nM (n = 8); PACAP1-R vs, 0.16 ± 0.01 nM (n = 8), p < 0.0007). Competition experiments with non-iodinated peptides indicated that both variants displayed similar affinity for PACAP-38, whereas PACAP-27 binding was impaired by the 21-aa domain (Table I and Fig. 3).TABLE I.Functional properties of PACAP1-R variantsPACAP1-RPACAP-38PACAP-27svssvs[125I]PACAP-27 displacement (Ki;nm)3.3 ± 0.62.8 ± 0.316 ± 2.3aSignificantly different from Ki value for PACAP-38 binding on PACAP1-R s (p < 0.002) and for PACAP-27 binding on PACAP1-R vs (p < 0.001).4.4 ± 0.9(n = 9)(n = 9)(n = 7)(n = 7)Stimulation of cAMP-regulated luciferase activity (EC50; nM)0.30 ± 0.030.22 ± 0.030.63 ± 0.05bDifferent from EC50 value for stimulation of luciferase activity by PACAP-38 through PACAP1-R s (p < 0.002) and by PACAP-27 through PACAP1-R vs (p < 0.006).0.33 ± 0.08(n = 5)(n = 6)(n = 5)(n = 6)Stimulation of total IP production (EC50; nM)21 ± 310 ± 1cDifferent from EC50 value for stimulation of total IP production by PACAP-27 through PACAP1-R vs (p < 0.004).212 ± 26dDifferent from EC50 value for stimulation of total IP production by PACAP-38 through PACAP1-R s (p < 0.0008) and by PACAP-27 through PACAP1-R vs (p < 0.0006).26 ± 3(n = 6)(n = 6)(n = 6)(n = 6)a Significantly different from Ki value for PACAP-38 binding on PACAP1-R s (p < 0.002) and for PACAP-27 binding on PACAP1-R vs (p < 0.001).b Different from EC50 value for stimulation of luciferase activity by PACAP-38 through PACAP1-R s (p < 0.002) and by PACAP-27 through PACAP1-R vs (p < 0.006).c Different from EC50 value for stimulation of total IP production by PACAP-27 through PACAP1-R vs (p < 0.004).d Different from EC50 value for stimulation of total IP production by PACAP-38 through PACAP1-R s (p < 0.0008) and by PACAP-27 through PACAP1-R vs (p < 0.0006). Open table in a new tab Since the 21-aa domain is strongly acidic and since the C-terminal extension of PACAP-38 is rich in basic residues, we hypothesized a direct interaction between these domains. To test this model, we measured the displacement of [125I]PACAP-27 by PACAP-(6-38) at each splice variant on intact cells. Binding of PACAP-(6-38) was not decreased by the absence of the 21-aa domain (Fig. 4). Regarding signal transduction properties of the vs variant, potencies in stimulation of cAMP-stimulated luciferase activity by PACAP-27 and -38 were not significantly different for PACAP1-R vs and differed only 2-fold for PACAP1-R s (Table I and Fig. 5). On the other hand, total inositol phosphate measurements indicated that PACAP-27 and -38 were closely potent at PACAP1-R vs whereas, as previously shown, PACAP-38 was one order of magnitude more potent than PACAP-27 at PACAP1-R s (Table I and Fig. 6).Fig. 6Stimulation of total inositol phosphate production by PACAP-27 and PACAP-38. Data are representative of six independent experiments performed in triplicate, which were analyzed with a four-parameter equation with the Kaleidagraph software.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The partial structure of the mouse PACAP1-R gene presented in this study is in agreement with recently reported data (37Aino H. Hashimoto H. Ogawa N. Nishino A. Yamamoto K. Nogi H. Nagata S. Baba A. Gene. 1995; 164: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the exon-intron structure of the PACAP1-R gene is conserved as compared with that of other members of the VIP-secretin-glucagon receptor family except for two regions: (i) the third intracellular loop for which two cassettes named hip and hop are possibly inserted (18Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar) and (ii) a 21-aa domain in the N-terminal extracellular region, which is also encoded by two exons. We previously demonstrated alternative splicing of the exons encoding the hip and hop cassettes. The present study demonstrates that the exons encoding the 21-aa domain are also alternatively spliced in the mouse PACAP1-R. Cloning of human PACAP1-R cDNAs confirmed the existence of the hip and hop splice variants (data not shown) as well as variants missing the 21-aa domain. Concurrent alternative splicing at both sites is possible since we also isolated clones with the hip or hop cassettes and missing the 21-aa domain (data not shown). In our previous study (18Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar), RT-PCR and in situ hybridization experiments demonstrated that alternative splicing of the exons encoding the hip and hop cassettes occurs in all tissues expressing PACAP1-R, with the s and hop variants being the most abundant. On the contrary, alternative splicing of the N-terminal domain was restricted to pituitary and adrenal glands and hypothalamus/thalamus, which suggests specific function of the vs variant. In agreement with previous studies (32Cao Y.-J. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), our results confirm that the N-terminal extracellular region of PACAP1-R is involved in ligand binding since alternative splicing of the 21-aa domain modulates selectivity for agonists binding. Note, the 21-aa domain is located in a region that has been shown to contain key residues for VIP binding at PACAP/VIP1-R (residues 63-109) (30Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Maoret J.-J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 31Gaudin P. Couvineau A. Maoret J.-J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the 21-aa domain influenced binding remains obscure. This domain behaved as an inhibitor of PACAP-27 binding. Since the only difference between PACAP-27 and -38 is the C-terminal extension of PACAP-38, and since both variants bound PACAP-38 with the same affinity, one can postulate that the inhibitory influence of the 21-aa domain was neutralized by the C-terminal extension of PACAP-38. Previous studies (38Gourlet P. Woussen-Colle M.-C. Robberecht P. De Neef P. Cauvin A. Vandermeers-Piret M.-C. Vandermeers A. Christophe J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 193: 535-541Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 39Robberecht P. Gourlet P. De Neef P. Woussen-Colle M.-C. Vandermeers A. Vandermeers-Piret M.-C. Christophe J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 40Hou X. Vandermeers A. Gourlet P. Vandermeers-Piret M.-C. Robberecht P. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1189-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) suggested that PACAP-38 interacts with its receptor through two distinct domains: (i) the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-5), which is shared with PACAP-27 and is the major determinant of PACAP binding and AC activation, and (ii) the C-terminal extension specific to PACAP-38 interacts with a distinct site on the receptor as deduced from the high affinity binding of PACAP-(6-38) as compared with PACAP-(6-27). Note, the 21-aa domain displays 7 acidic residues, and the C-terminal extension of PACAP-38 displays 6 basic residues, suggesting a possible direct interaction. If such an interaction would occur, one can predict that deletion of the 21-aa domain should strongly impair PACAP-(6-38) binding. In contrast, we showed that binding of PACAP-(6-38) was not affected by deletion of the 21-aa domain, indicating that a direct interaction is not involved. Therefore, the C-terminal extension of PACAP-38 more likely interacts with the extracellular domains of the receptor at another site, the conformation and accessibility of which is not modified by the presence of the 21-aa domain. The main functional consequence of the 21-aa deletion is an increased potency in PLC stimulation by PACAP-27, which is almost as potent as PACAP-38 at the vs variant. The physiological significance of PLC stimulation by PACAP-27, however, remains a matter of debate. In adult rats under resting physiological conditions, PACAP-38 is more abundant than PACAP-27 in all tissues expressing PACAP, indicating that the effects of PACAP are mainly due to PACAP-38 (41Arimura A. Somogyvari-Vigh A. Miyata A. Mizuno K. Coy D.H. Kitada C. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2787-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). However, in the anterior pituitary gland PACAP-38 is only two to four times more abundant than PACAP-27 (41Arimura A. Somogyvari-Vigh A. Miyata A. Mizuno K. Coy D.H. Kitada C. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2787-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), indicating a possible significant contribution of PACAP-27 to PACAP action. In the hypothalamus, PACAP-38 is 15 times more abundant than PACAP-27, but since PACAP is expressed at very high levels (575 ng of PACAP/g of wet tissue), PACAP-27 concentration is elevated and may significantly influence target cells (41Arimura A. Somogyvari-Vigh A. Miyata A. Mizuno K. Coy D.H. Kitada C. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2787-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we demonstrated alternative splicing of the exons encoding the 21-aa domain in the pituitary gland and the hypothalamus. In those tissues where PACAP-27 is possibly involved in PACAP action, regulation of alternative splicing of exons encoding the N-terminal domain of PACAP1-R is therefore a possible way of tuning PLC stimulation by PACAP. The vs variant would significantly contribute to stimulation of PLC by PACAP-27, whereas insertion of the 21-aa domain in the N-terminal extracellular region of PACAP1-R would lead to impairment of the PLC stimulation by the same dose of PACAP-27. The PACAP receptor therefore provided a unique example among G protein-coupled receptors of modulation of signal transduction properties by alternative splicing of extracellular and intracellular domains. Further experiments at the single cell level, however, will be necessary to correlate expression of the different PACAP1-R splice variants with functional parameters such as intracellular calcium concentration.

https://openalex.org/W1984874586,"Previous studies indicate that activation of c-Jun kinase (JNK) is necessary for apoptosis of trophic factor-deprived PC12 cells and that death in this system is suppressed by multiple agents, including BCL2, inhibitors of the interleukin-1-converting enzyme (ICE) family of proteases, blockers of transcription, and a variety of small molecules with differing modes of action. Here, we determine the order in which these agents block apoptosis relative to JNK activation. Overexpression of BCL2 promotes PC12 cell survival and blocks JNK activation caused by trophic factor withdrawal. Similarly, the survival-promoting agents aurintricarboxylic acid, N-acetylcysteine, the nitric oxide generator diethylenetriamine nitric oxide, 8-bromo-cGMP, and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP act upstream to inhibit JNK activation. In contrast, zVAD-fluoromethylketone (a permeant ICE family inhibitor), actinomycin D, and the G1/S cell cycle inhibitor deferoxamine, all promote survival after trophic factor withdrawal, but do not affect JNK activation. These findings are consistent with the presence of an ordered cell death pathway triggered by trophic factor deprivation in which 1) BCL2 and a number of survival-promoting agents act upstream of JNK, 2) ICE family protease actions, regulated genes required for cell death, and certain cell cycle blockers lie either downstream of JNK or on independent pathways required for apoptotic death.

In contrast, zVAD-fluoromethylketone (a permeant ICE family inhibitor), actinomycin D, and the G1/S cell cycle inhibitor deferoxamine, all promote survival after trophic factor withdrawal, but do not affect JNK activation. These findings are consistent with the presence of an ordered cell death pathway triggered by trophic factor deprivation in which 1) BCL2 and a number of survival-promoting agents act upstream of JNK, 2) ICE family protease actions, regulated genes required for cell death, and certain cell cycle blockers lie either downstream of JNK or on independent pathways required for apoptotic death. Apoptosis is a tightly regulated process of cell death accompanied by clumping of chromatin, nuclear disruption, and formation of cytosol containing apoptotic bodies (1Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6728) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical evidence has suggested that apoptotic death proceeds by one or more ordered pathways. Studies with Caenorhabditis elegans have proved to be particularly insightful for recognizing specific genes in this pathway that govern survival and death (2Ellis R.E. Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). Of special interest is ced-3, which is necessary for programmed cell death (2Ellis R.E. Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev.

Although expression of certain ced-9/BCL2 family members may counteract the death promoting actions of ced-3/ICE family proteases (13Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J.

For instance, inhibitors of protein or RNA synthesis suppress death of growth factor-deprived neurons (15Martin D. Schmidt R. DiStefano P. Lowry O. Carter J. Johnson Jr., E.M. J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). The relative positions of such gene products in the cell death pathways are also unknown. Recently, studies have implicated c-Jun kinase (JNK/SAPK) as an obligate component of the cell death pathway in PC12 cells (18Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). JNK is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase superfamily that phosphorylates the N-terminal of c-Jun, thereby activating the transcriptional transactivation potential of this factor (21Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F-X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). JNK is regulated through both Ras-dependent and independent pathways involving MEKK1 and JNKK (MKK4) kinases (22Minden A. Lin A. Smeal T. Derijard B. Cobb M. Davis R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 23Smael T. Binetruy B. Mercola D. Grover-Bardwick A. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Karin M. Mol.

Cobb M. Davis R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The activity of JNK is also markedly elevated in response to growth factor withdrawal from cultured PC12 cells (18Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar, 25Park D.S. Farinelli S.E. Greene L.A. J. Biol.

(1995) Cold Spring Harbor Programmed Cell Death, September 20-24, Cold Spring Harbor, NY. Xia et al. (18Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar) reported that JNK activation is required for apoptosis of neuronally differentiated PC12 cells after NGF deprivation. Transient transfection with constitutively active MEKK1 promoted apoptosis of these cells, while coexpression with dominant-negative forms of c-Jun attenuated this effect (18Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). Transient expression of dominant-negative forms of MKK4 also diminished death caused by NGF withdrawal (18Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). With regard to relative position in cell death pathways, the positioning of JNK activation has not been defined. To understand the mechanisms by which trophic factors govern survival and death of neuronal and other cell types, we and others have exploited the PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line (26Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar). Under serum-containing culture conditions, PC12 cells divide and resemble precursors of adrenal chromaffin cells and sympathetic neurons. Treatment with NGF causes these cells to cease proliferation and induces a neuronal phenotype (26Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar). Withdrawal of trophic support, either by serum deprivation of proliferating neuroblast-like PC12 cells or by NGF/serum removal from neuronally differentiated cells, leads to their apoptotic death (27Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 28Rukenstein A. Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Bastitatou A.

NGF withdrawal similarly triggers death of sympathetic neurons both in vivo (31Levi-Montalcini R. Booker B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1960; 46: 384-391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Gorin P.D. Johnson Jr., E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Buckmaster A.E. Tolkovsky A.M. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 2140-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Apoptotic death of trophic factor-deprived PC12 cells appears to be regulated by pathways that contain many of the elements discussed above. Consistent with apoptosis in other cell systems, overexpression of BCL2 (35Batistatou A. Merry D.E. Korsmeyer S.J. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4422-4428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Mah S.P. Zhong L.T. Liu Y. Roghani A. Edwards R.H. Bredesen D.E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1183-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and inhibition of the ICE family proteases (37Troy C.M. Stefanis L. Prochiantz A. Greene L.A. Shelanski M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5635-5640Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) attenuates PC12 death caused by withdrawal of trophic support. Moreover, death of neuronal PC12 cells is blocked by inhibition of RNA synthesis (17Mesner P.W. Winters T.R. Green S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1669-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and appears to require JNK activation (18Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). Examination of cell death in PC12 cells and their sympathetic neuron counterparts has lead to identification of a wide variety of agents that confer protection from loss of trophic support. These include the putative endonuclease inhibitor (38Hallick R.B. Chelm B.K. Gray P.W. Orozco E.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 3055-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) (29Bastitatou A. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar); cell cycle inhibitors, including ciclopirox, deferoxamine, mimosine, (39Farinelli S.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1150-1162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), olomoucine, and flavopiridol (25Park D.S. Farinelli S.E. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8161-8169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar); activators of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (28Rukenstein A. Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (40Ferrari G. Yan C.Y.I. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2857-2866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Yan C.Y.I. Ferrari G. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26827-26832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), a reducing agent that blocks cell cycle; and agents that elevate or mimic intracellular cGMP, including nitric oxide generators and permeant cGMP analogues (42Farinelli S.E. Park D.S. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2325-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the efficacy of these treatments, the relative positions at which they block apoptotic death has again been unclear. The present studies are aimed at elucidating the relative biochemical positions of molecules that either participate in, or interfere with, the pathways that lead to apoptotic death. In particular, we have investigated whether BCL2, ICE family protease inhibition, inhibition of RNA synthesis, and a variety of additional survival-promoting agents (ATA, NAC, cAMP, cGMP, and deferoxamine) interfere with activation of JNK after withdrawal of trophic support from PC12 cells. By identifying whether these molecules block cell death prior to or subsequent to JNK activation, we can begin to formulate the sequence of events in the cell death pathway. Human recombinant NGF was kindly provided by Genentech. NAC, ATA, 8-bromo-cGMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP, and deferoxamine were purchased from Sigma Diethylenetriamine nitric oxide (DETA·NO) was obtained from Research Biochemical International (Natick, MA). The construct containing the GST-c-Jun fusion protein was a generous gift from Dr. Michael Karin (University of California, San Diego, CA). zVAD-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) was obtained from Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA). PC12 cells overexpressing BCL2 and an empty neomycin-resistant construct (lines PC12bcl-2.1 and PC12neo.1, respectively) were generated and characterized as described previously (35Batistatou A. Merry D.E. Korsmeyer S.J. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4422-4428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PC12 cells were cultured and passaged as described previously (26Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar, 28Rukenstein A. Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum and on rat tail collagen-coated 100-mm plates. Neuronally differentiated PC12 cells were obtained by plating 1-2 × 107 naive cells onto 100-mm collagen-coated dishes in the presence of 100 ng/ml NGF for a period of 8-10 days in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1% heat-inactivated horse serum. Survival experiments were performed as described previously (28Rukenstein A. Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, naive or neuronally differentiated PC12 cells were extensively washed in serum- and NGF-free RPMI 1640 medium and replated onto 24-well tissue culture dishes with the indicated agent. The final volume of medium in each well was 1 ml. At appropriate times, cells were lysed and numbers of viable cells were determined by counting numbers of intact nuclei. Survival data are expressed as a percentage of cells plated at time 0 ± S.E. (n = 3). Naive PC12 cells were washed five times on the dish and, after mechanical detachment, subjected to three cycles of centrifugation/resuspension, all with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. The washed cells were replated onto fresh collagen-coated 100 mm dishes in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and in the presence/absence of the appropriate survival agent for various times. In the case of deferoxamine experiments, 16-h pretreatment was carried out in the presence of full serum-containing RPMI 1640 medium. Neuronally differentiated PC12 cells were washed on the plate six times with serum- and NGF-free RPMI 1640 medium and incubated in the same medium containing the presence/absence of appropriate agents for various times. After incubation, cells were harvested, extracted, and c-Jun kinase activity was affinity-purified from cell extracts with recombinant GST-c-Jun as described previously (25Park D.S. Farinelli S.E. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8161-8169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 43Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). The amount of cellular extract used for c-Jun kinase purification was normalized for protein content (400 µg/sample) as quantified by the Bio-Rad protein assay. c-Jun kinase activity recovered from each sample was determined by an in vitro solid-phase kinase radioassay as described previously (43Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). GST-c-Jun was resolved on 8.5% SDS gels and incorporation of 32PO4 into this substrate was quantified by autoradiography and densitometry. To assess the effects of survival agents on JNK activity in vitro, activated c-Jun kinase was isolated from PC12 cells after treatment with 0.5 mM sodium arsenite for 30 min and solid-phase kinase assays were carried out in the presence of constant amounts of activated enzyme and with/without the indicated agents. To determine the point at which BCL2 prevents cell death of trophic factor-deprived PC12 cells in relation to JNK activation, we examined the levels of JNK activity in serum-withdrawn cultures of wild-type PC12 cells and in PC12 cells stabily transfected with a plasmid containing the neomycin resistance gene with (PC12-BCL2 cells) or without (PC12-2A9) BCL2. As shown in Fig. 1A, serum deprivation resulted in approximately 50% death of wild-type and PC12-2A9 cells by 1 day and 75% death by day 2, whereas NGF treatment completely blocked death. As reported previously (34Edwards S.N. Buckmaster A.E. Tolkovsky A.M. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 2140-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), PC12-BCL2 cells did not die in the absence of trophic support (Fig. 1A), even after 5 days (data not shown). Consistent with past findings (25Park D.S. Farinelli S.E. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8161-8169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), serum deprivation elevated JNK activity in wild-type and control PC12-2A9 cells within 2 h (Fig. 1B). This increase reached a maximum level of approximately 4-20-fold by 4 h of serum withdrawal and was suppressed by NGF treatment (Figs. 1B and 2-5). In contrast to wild-type and control PC12-2A9 cells, there was no increase in JNK activity in serum-deprived PC12 cells overexpressing BCL2, even after 5 days (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Parallel experiments were carried out with BCL2-overexpressing PC12 cultures that had been neuronally differentiated by pre-exposure to NGF in serum-free medium for at least 1 week and then subjected to NGF withdrawal. However, in this case, BCL2 overexpression did not confer protection from death (nor did it block JNK activation). Thus, for neuronal PC12 cells, we were unable to draw conclusions about the relationship between the effects of BCL2 on death and on JNK activation. Treatment of wild-type PC12 cells (37Troy C.M. Stefanis L. Prochiantz A. Greene L.A. Shelanski M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5635-5640Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) as well as of neurons with inhibitors of ICE-family proteases (14Gagliardini V. Fernandez P-A. Lee R.K.K. Drexler H.C.A.

The permeant tripeptide-based inhibitor zVAD-fmk promotes the survival of PC12 cells (37Troy C.M. Stefanis L. Prochiantz A. Greene L.A. Shelanski M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5635-5640Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) after withdrawal of either serum (Fig. 2A) or NGF (Fig. 2B). As with serum deprivation, NGF withdrawal leads to significantly enhanced JNK activity by 4 h (Figs. 2D, 4, and 5; Ref. 18Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). In contrast to NGF treatment or BCL2 overexpression, zVAD-fmk does not block activation of JNK in response to withdrawal of serum or of NGF. These results indicate that in the PC12 cell system, BCL2 appears to act upstream of JNK activation and that ICE-like proteases, in contrast, appear to be required for cell death at a point either downstream of JNK activation or on an independent pathway required for cell death. In addition to NGF, BCL2, and ICE family inhibitors, we and others have uncovered a variety of agents that promote survival of naive and neuronally differentiated PC12 cells as well as sympathetic neurons after withdrawal of trophic support. To determine whether these lie upstream of JNK activation, we applied these agents to both serum-deprived naive PC12 cells and NGF/serum-deprived neuronally differentiated PC12 cells under conditions in which they prevent death and then measured JNK activity. In these and other experiments, the magnitude of JNK activation caused by NGF withdrawal from neuronally differentiated cells was consistently severalfold lower than for naive cells deprived of serum. This appears to reflect a somewhat higher basal level of JNK activity in control neuronally differentiated cultures. As shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, the survival promoting agents DETA·NO (a nitric oxide generator), ATA, NAC, 8-bromo-cGMP, and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (CPT-cAMP) all significantly attenuated induction of JNK activity. These observations indicate that each of these agents acts prior to induction of JNK activity in the pathway that leads to apoptotic death.Fig. 4Multiple agents that prevent death also attenuate JNK activation in neuronally differentiated PC12 cells deprived of NGF. Neuronal PC12 cells were deprived of NGF for the indicated times. The indicated survival agents were added immediately following NGF deprivation. JNK activity was determined using GST-c-Jun protein as substrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The figure shows autoradiograph depicting levels of 32PO4 incorporation into GST-c-Jun during the JNK assay. The densitometric values of the autoradiographic signals indicate phosphate incorporation in cell extracts containing equal amounts of protein at each time point and are normalized such that the zero time point is defined as 1. A, effect of NAC, DETA·NO, and 8-bromo-cGMP on JNK activation. B, effect of ATA on JNK activation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previous work has shown that the survival-promoting actions of NAC, but not of other survival agents, in serum-deprived PC12 cultures are blocked by actinomycin D (41Yan C.Y.I. Ferrari G. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26827-26832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined whether inhibition of JNK activation by NAC is also transcription-dependent. Naive PC12 cultures were deprived of serum in the presence or absence of NAC, NGF, and CPT-cAMP and of 10 µM actinomycin D. Although actinomycin D did not block the ability of NGF and CPT-cAMP to suppress JNK activation, JNK activity in cultures treated with NAC and actinomycin were even higher than in control cultures (data not shown). These results indicate that inhibition of both death and JNK activation by NAC require transcription. We previously reported that the Cdk/cell cycle inhibitor, flavopiridol, promotes survival of NGF-deprived neuronal PC12 cells, but does not block elevation of JNK activity under these conditions (25Park D.S. Farinelli S.E. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8161-8169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We therefore tested deferoxamine (DFX), an agent that arrests cell cycle by a mechanism that is not completely understood and that suppresses death of PC12 cells and sympathetic neurons (39Farinelli S.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1150-1162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PC12 cells were pretreated overnight with 1 mM DFX and then deprived of serum in presence of the drug. As shown in Fig. 5A, despite treatment with DFX, JNK activation was similar to that in untreated control cultures. Fig. 5C shows survival measured with the same set of cells which verifies the survival promoting activity of DFX in this experiment. Actinomycin D suppresses death of neuronally differentiated PC12 cells and sympathetic neurons induced by removal of NGF (17Mesner P.W. Winters T.R. Green S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1669-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 5, B and D, show that in contrast to its survival promoting actions in the same experiment, actinomycin did not prevent the 3-fold induction of JNK activity brought about by NGF withdrawal. In fact, exposure to actinomycin appeared to somewhat increase JNK activity, either in the absence (Fig. 5B) or presence (data not shown) of NGF, indicating that this agent may induce cellular stress. Taken together, our findings suggest that DFX and actinomycin, as zVAD-fmk, but unlike the other molecules discussed above, promote survival at a point either after JNK activation or, alternatively, on a separate death signaling pathway. Although zVAD, actinomycin, and deferoxamine do not prevent the intracellular activation of JNK activity (as discussed above), it was possible that these agents may act to directly inhibit JNK activity in cells. To evaluate this, JNK was activated in PC12 cells by exposure to arsenite, affinity-purified, and assessed for activity in the presence and absence of each compound at the concentrations used to prevent cell death. As shown in Fig. 6, none of the three agents directly affected JNK activity. Previous studies have shown that multiple molecules prevent the death of naive and neuronal PC12 cells deprived of trophic support (25Park D.S. Farinelli S.E. Greene L.A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1977764715,"In the mitochondria of trypanosomatid protozoa the precursors of messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) have their coding information remodeled by the site-specific insertion and deletion of uridylate (U) residues. Small trans-acting guide RNAs (gRNAs) supply the genetic information for this RNA editing. An in vitro system was developed to study the mechanism of U insertion into pre-mRNA. U-insertion editing occurs through a series of enzymatic steps that begin with gRNA-directed pre-mRNA cleavage. Inserted U's are derived from free uridine triphosphate and are added to the 3′ terminus of a 5′ pre-mRNA cleavage product. gRNA specifies edited RNA sequence at the subsequent ligation step by base pairing-mediated juxtaposition of the 3′ cleavage product and the processed 5′ cleavage product. gRNA/pre-mRNA chimeras, purported intermediates, seem to be abortive end products of the same reaction."

Increasing attention thus has been paid to mechanism of their assembly leading to activation of the enzyme. The first indication for the mechanism emerges from experiments using neutrophils from CGD patients (27Heyworth P.G. Curnutte J.T. Nauseef W.M. Volpp B.D. Pearson D.W. Rosen H. Clark R.A. J. Clin.

Neither p47phox nor p67phox translocates to the membrane in stimulated neutrophils that lack cytochrome b558, indicating that the cytochrome provides a membrane docking site for the cytosolic components. In p47phox-deficient neutrophils, p67phox fails to migrate, whereas p47phox does bind to the membrane in stimulated neutrophils from patients deficient in p67phox. Similar dependence of p67phox translocation on the presence of p47phox is observed using a cell-free system consisting of the neutrophil membrane and recombinant cytosolic proteins (29Uhlinger D.J.

Also in interaction between p47phox and cytochrome b558, SH3 domains seem to play a crucial role. We and Leto et al. (30Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 32Leto T.L. Adams A.G. de Mendez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This substitution occurs in a CGD patient whose cytochrome b558 is normal in both appearance and abundance as determined by visible spectroscopy and by immunoblot analyses but is devoid of activity in the cell-free oxidase activation system (41Dinauer M.C. Pierce E.A. Erickson R.W. Muhlebach T.J. Messner H. Orkin S.H. Seger R.A. Curnutte J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11231-11235Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Membrane translocation of p47phox is impaired in activated neutrophils from the same patient (42Leusen J.H.W. Bolscher B.G.J.M. Hilarius P.M. Weening R.S. Kaulfersch W. Seger R.A. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2329-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus the interaction via the SH3 domains of p47phox appears to be involved in both assembly and activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. Several questions, however, remain to be answered. Which SH3 domain of p47phox directly binds to p22phox? What is the nature of the binding? Is the domain essential for the oxidase activation? Here we show that the N-terminal SH3 domain of p47phox binds to the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of p22phox with high affinity. The binding is highly specific to this SH3 domain and requires the Pro156-containing proline-rich region but not other putative SH3 domain-binding sites of p22phox. Furthermore, a mutant p47phox carrying the Trp193→ Arg substitution in the N-terminal SH3 domain, a mutation leading to defective interaction with p22phox, is incapable of supporting superoxide production under cell-free activation conditions. This specific interaction, thus, is required for activation of the NADPH oxidase. The DNA fragments encoding the full-length p47phox (p47-F; amino acid residues 1-390 of p47phox), p47-SH3(N) (amino acid residues 154-219), p47-SH3(C) (amino acid residues 223-286), and p47-(SH3)2 (amino acid residues 154-286) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a cloned cDNA encoding human p47phox and subcloned into the pGEX-2T expression vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.)

For a mutant p47-SH3(N) carrying the Trp193→ Arg substitution, namely p47-SH3(N)(W193R), the mutation was introduced into p47-SH3(N) by PCR site-directed mutagenesis. For the fragment encoding p47-F(W193R), the mutation leading to replacement of Trp193 by Arg was introduced into p47-F by PCR site-directed mutagenesis, and the PCR fragment was cloned in-frame into the 5′-AccI and 3′-StuI sites of the pGEX-2T-p47-F to give pGEX-2T-p47-F(W193R). The DNA fragments encoding the full-length p67phox (p67-F; amino acid residues 1-526), p67-SH3(N) (amino acid residues 238-301), and p67-SH3(C) (amino acid residues 455-526) were amplified by PCR from a cloned cDNA encoding human p67phox, which was a generous gift from Dr. Hiroyuki Nunoi (University of Tokyo). The PCR products were subcloned into the pGEX-2T expression vector. The cDNA encoding the cytoplasmic domain of human p22phox (amino acid residues 132-195), designated as p22-(132-195), was obtained by PCR from a human neutrophil cDNA library. For the fragment encoding p22-(132-195, P156Q), the mutation was introduced into p22-(132-195) by PCR site-directed mutagenesis. The DNA fragments encoding p22-(132-150), p22-(132-170), p22-(145-170), p22-(145-195), and p22-(163-195) was constructed by PCR of p22-(132-195). The PCR fragments were cloned in-frame into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pGEX-2T vector. The DNA fragment encoding p22-(151-160) was derived from synthetic oligonucleotides, which were cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pGEX-2T vector. Sequencing of the constructs to confirm their identity was done with Sequenase according to the manufacturer's protocol (U. S. Biochemicals). Expression vectors that encode SH3 domains of Src, CRK, Abl, and phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) were generous gifts from Drs. Michiyuki Matsuda (the National Institute of Health, Japan) and Shinya Tanaka (Hokkaido University) (43Tanaka S. Hattori S. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Fukui Y. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell.

The fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione-Sepharose-4B beads (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The GST fusion proteins containing various regions of p22phox (10 pmol) purified by glutathione-Sepharose-4B beads were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked by buffer A (500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5) containing 3% non-fat dry milk for 2 h at room temperature. The GST-fusion proteins with various SH3 domains (3 µg/ml) were added to buffer A plus 0.25% gelatin, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and washed four times with buffer A containing 0.1% Tween 20. The filter was probed with an anti-GST monoclonal antibody (43Tanaka S. Hattori S. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Fukui Y. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4409-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which was kindly provided by Dr. Yoichi Tachibana (Nippon Zeon Corp.), in buffer A plus 0.25% gelatin for 2 h at room temperature and washed three times with buffer A plus 0.1% Tween 20. Complexes were detected using anti-mouse IgG antibodies. Under the condition used in this study, the anti-GST monoclonal antibody did not recognize GST fusion proteins transferred to nitrocellulose membranes after SDS-PAGE. The vectors and strains used for two-hybrid experiments were obtained from CLONTECH, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). The multiple cloning sites of pGBT9 and pGAD424 were modified so that the inserts from glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion plasmids (pGEX-2T, Pharmacia) can be readily transferred in correct orientation and reading frames. The cDNAs encoding the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of p22phox, p22-(132-195), and its mutant p22-(132-195, P156Q) were transferred from corresponding GST-fusion constructs to the modified GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector, pGBT9g, thereby constructing pGBT::p22-(132-195) (amino acid residues 132-195) and pGBT::p22-(132-195, P156Q), respectively. The tandem SH3 domains of p47phox, namely p47-(SH3)2 (amino acid residues 154-286), was transferred from pGEX-2T-p47-(SH3)2 (30Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) to pGAD424g, constructing pGAD::p47-(SH3)2. For the plasmid pGAD::p47-(SH3)2(W193R), the mutation was introduced into p47-(SH3)2 by PCR site-directed mutagenesis. All the possible pairs between the pGBT and pGAD plasmids were cotransformed into competent yeast HF7c cells with HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes using a modified lithium-acetate method (44Gietz D. Jean St A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2849) Google Scholar). Following the selection for Leu+ and Trp+ phenotype, transformants were tested for their ability to grow on plates lacking histidine. These indicator plates were supplemented with 10 mM 3-aminotriazole to suppress the background growth due to leaky expression of HIS3 gene in HF7c cells. The pairs of the plasmids were also cotransformed into competent SFY526 cells with HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes, and activation of lacZ reporter was examined by β-galactosidase filter assay according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) for the indicated SH3 domains with immobilized GST-p22-(132-195) or GST-p22-(132-195, P156Q) was calculated from data obtained using the interactive analysis system (IAsys, Fisons Applied Sensor Technology) where a laser biosensor measures real-time optical changes occurring when an analyte binds to its partner (45Chalkely G.E. Knowles P.P. Whitehead P.C. Coffer A.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 46Watts H.J. Lowe C.R. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 2465-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). GST-p22-(132-195), GST-p22-(132-195, P156Q), or GST alone was coupled to the reaction cuvette at concentrations of 1-2 µg/mm2 and kinetic analysis was completed at various concentrations of the indicated SH3 domains. For a pseudo-first-order reaction, the rate is described by Equation 1: dR/dl=ka⋅Rmax⋅C−(ka⋅C+kd)⋅R(Eq. 1) where ka = association rate constant, kd = dissociation rate constant, Rmax = maximal binding, R = amount bound (biosensor response), and C = concentration of SH3 domain. In this study, measured on-rate constant (kon) can be obtained from analysis of association curve, and then ka and kd were determined by plotting kon (equal to negative of the slope of dR/dt versus R) for several concentrations of the SH3 domains against their respective concentrations. Each will result in a plot with slope equal to ka with intercept on the y axis equal to kd according to Equation 2: kon=ka⋅C+kd(Eq. 2) KD was calculated from Equation 3: kD=kd/ka(Eq. 3) Human neutrophils were isolated from healthy volunteers by dextran sedimentation, hypotonic lysis, and the Conray-Ficoll centrifugation (47Aoyagi K. Takeshige K. Sumimoto H. Nunoi H. Minakami S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 186: 391-397Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Membrane and cytosolic fractions of the neutrophils were prepared by sequential centrifugations as described previously (48Nozaki M. Takeshige K. Sumimoto H. Minakami S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Rac2-enriched fraction was prepared by the method as described previously (47Aoyagi K. Takeshige K. Sumimoto H. Nunoi H. Minakami S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 186: 391-397Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, the neutrophil cytosolic fraction was applied to a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose CL-6B column to which both p47phox and p67phox bound. The flow-through fraction was dialyzed and then applied onto a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column. After washing, the Rac fraction was eluted with 0.2 M NaCl. The fraction contained Rac2 but was free of p47phox and p67phox as confirmed by immunodetection. The NADPH oxidase activity in a cell-free system was assayed using human neutrophil membrane, the Rac2-enriched fraction, and recombinant p47phox and p67phox, each expressed as a GST-fusion protein, as described by Leusen et al. (33Leusen J.H.W. Fluiter K. Hilarius P.M. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. Bolscher B.G.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11216-11221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The assay mixture was composed of 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 75 µM cytochrome c, 10 µM FAD, 10 µM GTPγS, 1.0 mM EGTA, and 1.0 mM NaN3. The neutrophil membrane (5.1 µg/ml), recombinant p67phox (GST-p67-F) (1.3 µg/ml), and the Rac2-enriched fraction (36 µg/ml) were mixed with the indicated concentrations of the full-length p47phox (GST-p47-F) or the Trp193→ Arg mutant (GST-p47-F(W193R)), followed by incubation with an optimal concentration of SDS (100 µM) for 2 min at room temperature. The reaction was initiated by addition of NADPH (1.0 mM) to the reaction mixture, and NADPH-dependent superoxide-producing activity was measured by determining the rate of superoxide dismutase-inhibitable ferricytochrome c reduction using a dual-wavelength spectrophotometer (Hitachi 557). Under the assay condition used, a negligible activity was detected in the absence of p67phox or Rac2. We and others (30Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 32Leto T.L. Adams A.G. de Mendez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10650-10654Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) have previously shown that the region of the tandem SH3 domains of p47phox expressed as a GST fusion protein (GST-p47-(SH3)2) binds to the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of p22phox but fails to interact with a mutant p22phox carrying the Pro156→ Gln substitution in a proline-rich region. It remained unsolved which one of the two SH3 domains directly interacts with p22phox. To address this question, we expressed and purified each SH3 domain as a GST fusion protein (GST-p47-SH3(N) and GST-p47-SH3(C)) and tested their ability to bind to p22phox. In the present study, the anti-GST monoclonal antibody (43Tanaka S. Hattori S. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Fukui Y. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4409-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was used for detection of an SH3 domain-target complex, instead of using biotinylated GST-SH3 domain-fusion proteins as in the previous studies (30Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 32Leto T.L. Adams A.G. de Mendez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10650-10654Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Biotinylation may affect binding activity of the proteins, depending on their amino acid sequences. The present method thus enabled us to compare binding activities of various SH3 domains under the same experimental condition. As shown in Fig. 1, GST-p47-SH3(N) strongly bound to the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of p22phox (lane 1). On the other hand, no binding could be observed when GST-p47-SH3(C) was used (lane 3). The binding of GST-p47-SH3(N) was completely abolished by a single amino acid substitution of Gln for Pro156 in a proline-rich region of p22phox (lane 2), indicating that this region is involved in the interaction with the SH3 domain. To study further the nature of the interaction, we introduced a mutation to the N-terminal SH3 domain of p47phox (p47-SH3(N)), resulting in replacement of Trp193 by Arg. This tryptophan residue is the most conserved one in SH3 domains (49Musacchio A. Gibson T. Lehto V.-P. Saraste M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and it directly interacts with a proline of target peptides (50Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar, 51Terasawa H. Kohda D. Hatanaka H. Tsuchiya S. Ogura K. Nagata K. Ishii S. Mandiyan V. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Inagaki F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Equivalent mutations (substitution of Arg or Leu for Trp) in Src and CRK result in loss of function (43Tanaka S. Hattori S. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Fukui Y. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4409-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 52Liu X. Marengere L.E.M. Koch C.A. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5225-5232Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The mutant p47-SH3(N) carrying the Trp193→ Arg substitution failed to interact with p22phox (lane 5), suggesting that p47-SH3(N) binds to p22phox in a manner common to SH3 domains. This raised a question whether the binding to p22phox is specific to p47-SH3(N) among SH3 domains. We tested several SH3 domains from various proteins. Neither N-terminal nor C-terminal SH3 domain of p67phox could interact with p22phox (lanes 6 and 7). No binding was observed with SH3 domains of other signaling proteins, v-Src, CRK, Abl, or phospholipase C-γ1 (lanes 8-11). Thus, p47-SH3(N) specifically binds to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of p22phox. The finding that replacement of Pro156 by Gln in a proline-rich region of p22phox abolished the activity to interact with p47-SH3(N) (Fig. 1, lane 2) suggests that this region is at least one of the targets of the SH3 domain. The search for SH3 domain-binding sites using peptide libraries and structural analysis of SH3 domains complexed with proline-rich peptides have revealed that a Pro-Xaa-Xaa-Pro motif is the minimal requisite for SH3 domain binding in several signaling proteins (50Yu H.

We have recently identified and characterized a novel member of the FLAP/LTC4 synthase gene family termed microsomal glutathione S-transferase II (microsomal GST-II). The open reading frame encodes a 16.6-kDa protein with a calculated pI of 10.4. Microsomal GST-II has 33% amino acid identity to FLAP, 44% amino acid identity to LTC4 synthase, and 11% amino acid identity to the previously characterized human microsomal GST (microsomal GST-I). Microsomal GST-II also has a similar hydrophobicity pattern to FLAP, LTC4 synthase, and microsomal GST-I. Fluorescent in situ hybridization mapped microsomal GST-II to chromosomal localization 4q28-31. Microsomal GST-II has a wide tissue distribution (at the mRNA level) and was specifically expressed in human liver, spleen, skeletal muscle, heart, adrenals, pancreas, prostate, testis, fetal liver, and fetal spleen. In contrast, microsomal GST-II mRNA expression was very low (when present) in lung, brain, placenta, and bone marrow. This differs from FLAP mRNA, which was detected in lung, various organs of the immune system, and peripheral blood leukocytes, and LTC4 synthase mRNA, which could not be detected in any tissues by Northern blot analysis. Microsomal GST-II and LTC4 synthase were expressed in a baculovirus insect cell system, and microsomes from Sf9 cells containing microsomal GST-II or LTC4 synthase were both found to catalyze the production of LTC4 from LTA4 and reduced glutathione. Microsomal GST-II also catalyzed the formation of another product, displaying a conjugated triene UV absorption spectra with a maximum at 283 nm, suggesting less catalytic stereospecificity compared with LTC4 synthase. Also, the apparent Km for LTA4 was higher for microsomal GST-II (41 µM) than LTC4 synthase (7 µM). In addition, unlike LTC4 synthase, microsomal GST-II was able to catalyze the conjugation of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene with reduced glutathione. Therefore, it is proposed that this novel membrane protein is a member of the microsomal glutathione S-transferase family, also including LTC4 synthase, with significant sequence identities to both LTC4 synthase and FLAP. 5-Lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) synthase, two proteins involved in leukotriene biosynthesis, have been demonstrated to be 31% identical at the amino acid level.

Leukotrienes are biologically active compounds that function as mediators of various inflammatory processes, such as leukocyte chemotaxis, increased vascular permeability, smooth muscle constriction, and increased mucus secretion (1Samuelsson B.

Cellular leukotriene biosynthesis is initiated by a rise in intracellular calcium, which induces the release of arachidonic acid from different phospholipids by various classes of phospholipases (3Cockroft S.

Subsequently, 5-lipoxygenase catalyzes a two-step reaction from arachidonic acid to the unstable epoxide LTA4 via 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (9Shimizu T. RÅdmark O. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This reaction in intact cells requires the presence of FLAP (10Dixon R.A.F. Diehl R.E. Opas E. Rands E. Vickers P.J.

Also, human endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and platelets all express LTC4 synthase activity without concomitant expression of 5-lipoxygenase.

Successful attempts to purify LTC4 synthase in the KG-1 myeloid cell line as well as dimethyl sulfoxide-differentiated U937 cells have confirmed LTC4 synthase as being a distinct membrane protein with no activity toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (substrate for the α, µ, π, and microsomal classes of GSTs) or p-nitrobenzylchloride (substrate for the class of GSTs) as well as lack of recognition by specific antisera raised against α, µ, π, and microsomal GSTs (29Penrose J.F.

Cytosolic GSTs are active as homo- or heterodimers of subunits of ~25 kDa, whereas microsomal GST is active as a trimer with a subunit size of 17 kDa (40Awasthi Y.C. Sharma R. Singhal S.S. Int. J.

Pharmacol. 1994; 27: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Both cytosolic and microsomal GSTs are heavily expressed in the liver but are also found in various tissues such as kidney, lung, skeletal muscle, intestine, adrenals, heart, pancreas, and testes (40Awasthi Y.C.

Pharmacol. 1994; 27: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene conjugation activity of both rat and human microsomal GSTs is activated by N-ethylmaleimide (42Morgenstern R. DePierre J. Ernster L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The cDNAs of both the rat and the human microsomal GST contain an open reading frame encoding a 154-amino acid polypeptide, and the two proteins show 85% amino acid identity (45DeJong J.L.

These enzymes will be referred to as human or rat microsomal glutathione S-transferase I (microsomal GST-I). The microsomal GST-I from both species has a wide specificity for lipophilic and electrophilic substrates; however, LTA4 is a poor substrate for microsomal GST-I (39Süderstrüm M. Hammarstrüm S. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 44Mosialou E. Andersson C. Lundqvist G. Andersson G. Bergman T. Jürnvall H. Morgenstern R.

The biological functions of GSTs are attributed to detoxification of xenobiotics and metabolism of drugs as well as protection from oxidative stress caused by lipid peroxidation (40Awasthi Y.C.

In this report we describe a novel protein with characteristics in common with FLAP, LTC4 synthase, and microsomal GST-I.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells—Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells were obtained from Invitrogen and cultured in Grace's insect media supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%), gentamycin (50 µg/ml), and fungizone (2.5 µg/ml). The cells were cultured at 28°C, and the stock cell concentration was maintained between 0.5 and 3 × 106 cells/ml. Isolation of granulocytes and mononuclear cells from human blood was performed essentially as described previously (49Büyum A. Tissue Antigens. 1974; 4: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 ml of whole blood, obtained from a healthy donor was mixed with dextran (0.5% w/v, final concentration). After sedimentation of the erythrocytes for 30 min, the resulting plasma was centrifuged at 200 × g for 15 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (Dulbecco's formula) and washed twice at 200 × g for 10 min. Erythrocytes were removed by hypotonic lysis with distilled water. Subsequently, the leukocytes were applied on a discontinuous density gradient (Ficoll-Isopaque) and centrifuged at 600 × g for 30 min (49Büyum A. Tissue Antigens. 1974; 4: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Mononuclear cells and granulocytes were collected and washed once. Viability was better than 98% as determined by trypan blue exclusion. The cell concentration was adjusted to 1.5 × 107/ml. Sequencing, Subcloning, and Construction of Recombinant BaculovirusesA TBLASTN search of the GenBank™ data base using the FLAP peptide sequence revealed similarity with the sequence deposited by the WashU-Merck EST project with an accession number of H59143. The sequence of the novel cDNA (termed microsomal GST-II) was confirmed on both strands according to the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method (50Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52363) Google Scholar), using the PRISM™ ready reaction dyedeoxy™ terminator cycle sequencing kit and an ABI model 373 DNA sequencer. Oligonucleotides for sequencing and RT-PCR were obtained from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). The insert cDNA sequence was released from the pT7T3D vector by an EcoRI/HindIII double digest, end-filled with Klenow, and blunt end-ligated into the StuI-cut multiple cloning site of the pFastBac vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). Virus was constructed according to the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus expression systems, as described by the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Also, a cDNA for LTC4 synthase was kindly provided by K. Scoggan.Chromosomal Localization of Microsomal GST-II by Fluorescence in Situ HybridizationHybridization screening of a P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) library followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed by Bios Laboratories, Inc. The initial PAC library screening was performed using a labeled microsomal GST-II cDNA probe obtained by random priming. Four positive PAC clones were obtained and confirmed by Southern blotting of the HaeIII-digested DNA. The clone with the best yield (PAC clone 180H14) was used in the subsequent chromosomal localization. The PAC clone 180H14 was labeled with digoxigenin dUTP by nick translation. The labeled probe was combined with human DNA and salmon sperm DNA and hybridized to prometaphase chromosomes obtained from PHA-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes in a solution containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2 × SSC. A biotin-labeled probe specific for the centromere of chromosome 4 was cohybridized with clone 180H14. Hybridization signals were detected with antidigoxigenin antibodies conjugated with rhodamine or fluoresceinated avidin, followed by counterstaining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.Northern Blot AnalysisNorthern blot of human multiple tissue blots (Clontech) was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The blots containing 2 µg of poly (A)+ RNA/lane were hybridized with the following radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes: microsomal GST-II, 5′-CAG TCG GAA ACC GGT GAT CCG TTT TTT AGC-3′ FLAP, 5′-AAA TAT GTA GCC AGG GGT GCT CTG CGT TCT-3′ LTC4 synthase, 5′-TCG CGT ACA GCG GTG CCA GCC TGA GCT GCG C-3′. These probes were selected from areas with minimal DNA sequence identity between FLAP, LTC4 synthase, and microsomal GST-II. For the labeling of the oligonucleotide probes we used [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont) and polynucleotide kinase (T4 PNK Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Prehybridization/hybridization was performed in the buffer described by the manufacturer (Clontech) at 47°C. After hybridization and washing, the blots were exposed to x-ray film (Kodak Biomax™ MR) at -70°C. The exposure time for microsomal GST-II and FLAP was 36 and 72 h, respectively.RT-PCRTotal RNA was isolated from granulocytes and mononuclear cells using Trizol™ Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Subsequently, cDNA was prepared from 2 µg of total RNA in a 40-µl incubation volume using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. PCR was carried out in 100 µl of incubation mixtures consisting of 2 µl of cDNA, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.5 µM each primer, and 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) in PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, pH 8.3). The conditions of the reaction were 1) 94°C for 4 min, 2) 94°C for 45 s, 60°C for 45 s, 72°C for 45 s, 3) 72°C for 10 min; 25 cycles were carried out for both β-actin and microsomal GST-II. Primers for microsomal GST-II were 5′-ATT CTC TCG GCC TGT CAG CAA AGT TAT-3′ and 5′-CAG TCG GAA ACC GGT GAT CCG TTT TTT AGC-3′ for regions which were specific for microsomal GST-II. β-actin primers were obtained from Clontech (human β-actin 838-base pair control amplimer set). The expected size of the microsomal GST-II DNA fragment was 294 base pairs. Aliqouts of the PCR mixtures (10 µl) were analyzed by electrophoresis using 1% agarose gels containing 0.5 µg/ml ethidium bromide. The identity of the PCR product corresponding to 294 bp from both granulocytes and mononuclear cells was confirmed by subcloning into pBBIII vector followed by DNA sequencing as described earlier.Analysis of LTC4 Synthase Activity in Infected Sf9 CellsSf9 cells were infected with microsomal GST-II, LTC4 synthase, or mock virus at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml. 72 h postinfection, the cells were harvested, washed, and pelleted by centrifugation at 300 × g. The cell viability was estimated by trypan blue stain exclusion and was reduced to approximately 30% viabilty compared with noninfected Sf9 controls (98% viability). The pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (Dulbecco's formula) and sonicated on ice for 3 × 10 s. After centrifugation (500 × g) for 10 min, the supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The pellet (microsomal fraction) was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Protein concentration was 10-15 mg/ml as determined by the Coomassie protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). In order to measure LTC4 synthase activity, the protein concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml using potassium inorganic phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4). Then 50 µl of protein was mixed with 50 µl of potassium inorganic phosphate buffer containing 10 mM reduced glutathione and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The reaction was started by the addition of LTA4 (2 µl of 1.5 mM LTA4 in EtOH). The reaction was terminated after 15 min by the addition of 100 µl of acetonitrile:methanol:acetic acid (50:50:1, v/v/v). Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Subsequently, 150 µl of the sample was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC equipped with a Novapak C18 column (3.0 × 150 mm, 4-µm particle size) obtained from Waters. The mobile phase was acetonitrile:MeOH:H2O:acetic acid at 29:19:52:1 (v/v/v/v, adjusted to pH 5.6 with 30% NaOH (w/v), and the flow rate was 1.2 ml/min. Qualitative analysis was performed by comparison with the retention time of synthetic LTC4 and on-line analysis of UV spectra of eluted compounds using a Waters 991 diode-array spectrophotometer. Amounts were calculated based on the peak area at 280 nm from known amounts of injected LTC4.Glutathione S-Transferase ActivityGlutathione S-transferase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by measuring formation of the conjugate of reduced GSH and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) at 340 nm (51Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomes of either Sf9 cells or Sf9 cells expressing microsomal GST-II or LTC4 synthase were diluted to 5 mg of protein/ml using sodium phosphate (0.11 M, pH 6.5). 5 µl of this sample (25 µg) was transferred into a 195-µl incubation mixture consisting of 1 mM GSH, 1 mM CDNB in sodium phosphate buffer (0.11 M, pH 6.5). The product formation was continuously measured at 340 nm for 5 min on a SpectraMac 250 (Fisher). In experiments where the effect of N-ethylmaleimide was investigated, a 50-µl aliquot of microsomes containing either microsomal GST-II or LTC4 synthase (at 2.5 mg/ml) was treated with 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide for 3 min. Thereafter, 10 µl of this protein was added to the incubation mixture (190 µl) containing 3 mM glutathione and 1 mM CDNB in sodium phosphate buffer (0.11 M, pH 6.5).DISCUSSIONA TBLASTN search of the GenBank™ data base using the FLAP peptide sequence has revealed a new clone with significant sequence identity to FLAP and LTC4 synthase and with limited sequence identity to microsomal GST. This novel protein retains LTA4 and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene-conjugating activity with reduced glutathione and was termed microsomal glutathione S-transferase II (Fig. 1).Sequence comparison of microsomal GST-II, LTC4 synthase, and FLAP shows that 33 of 147 amino acids are completely conserved in these proteins (Fig. 2). Also, microsomal GST-II and LTC4 synthase (amino acids 47-63) and FLAP (amino acids 51-67) display a limited sequence identity to microsomal GST-I (amino acids 70-86). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3, these regions correspond to the carboxyl terminus of the first hydrophilic stretch in all four proteins. Interestingly, a series of deletion mutants of FLAP in this region (deletions 37-53, 52-58, and 59-61) have demonstrated that this part of FLAP is critical for binding of leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors such as MK-886 and L-689,037 (56Vickers P.J. Adam M. Charleson S. Coppolino M.G. Evans J.F. Mancini J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 94-102PubMed Google Scholar, 57Mancini J.A. Coppolino M.C. Klassen J.H. Charleson S. Vickers P.J. Life Sci. 1994; 54: PL137-PL142Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Also, the binding of arachidonic acid to FLAP has been shown to be competed for by MK-886 (12Mancini J.A. Abramovitz M. Cox M.E. Wong E. Charleson S. Perrier H. Wang Z. Prasit P. Vickers P.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Therefore, a proposed mechanism of action for these leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors is to compete with arachidonic acid for its binding site on FLAP, FLAP acting as an arachidonic acid transfer protein for 5-lipoxygenase. In line with the fact that LTC4 synthase and microsomal GST-II both bind LTA4, whereas rat and human microsomal GST-I have been shown to catalyze the reduction of phospholipid hydroperoxides (41Andersson C. Mosialou E. Weinander R. Morgenstern R. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 27: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), this region is a candidate for being the binding site for the fatty acid backbone component of the various substrates/ligands.Due to the hydropathy pattern of FLAP (three hydrophobic regions separated by two hydrophilic regions) it has been proposed that FLAP spans a membrane bilayer 3 times (10Dixon R.A.F. Diehl R.E. Opas E. Rands E. Vickers P.J. Evans J.F. Gillard J.W. Miller D.K. Nature. 1990; 343: 282-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all of these four membrane proteins of approximately the same length display a similar hydrophobicity pattern (Fig. 3.). The fact that human microsomal GST-1 displays this hydrophobicity pattern plus the limited sequence identity to the other th"

Either plus-end or minus-end-directed motor domain binds at the same extent to both α- and β-tubulin subunits, suggesting that kinesin binding is an intrinsic property of each tubulin subunit and that motor directionality cannot be related to a preferential interaction with a given tubulin subunit. Binding features of dimeric versus monomeric rat kinesin heads suggest that dimerization could drive conformational changes to enhance binding to tubulin. Competition experiments have indicated that kinesin interacts with tubulin at a Tau-independent binding site. Complementary experiments have shown that kinesin does not interact with the same efficiency with the different tubulin isoforms. Masking the polyglutamyl chains with a specific monoclonal antibody leads to a complete inhibition of kinesin binding. These results are consistent with a model in which polyglutamylation of tubulin regulates kinesin binding through progressive conformational changes of the whole carboxyl-terminal domain of tubulin as a function of the polyglutamyl chain length, thus modulating the affinity of tubulin for kinesin and Tau as well. These results indicate that microtubules, through tubulin polymorphism, do have the ability to control microtubule-associated protein binding.

To coordinate these functions, the major problem in cells is to regulate not only the expression of the different MAPs but, more precisely, their differential interactions with MTs. Regulation of MAP binding through phosphorylation has been extensively documented (5Lindwall G. Cole R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5301-5305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Brugg B.

However, several reports have clearly shown that part of this regulation had also to be supported by the MTs themselves. For instance, it has been shown that in lobster axons, only a subset of MTs was competent for vesicle transport (12Miller R.H. Lasek R.J. Katz M.J. Science. 1987; 235: 220-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), suggesting that the MT surface available for interaction with motors was not homogeneous along all of the axonal MTs. The same relationship between distinct MT subsets and specific binding of kinesin-like proteins has also been observed in the mitotic spindle apparatus (13Nislow C. Lombillo V.A. Kuriyama R. McIntosh J.R. Nature. 1992; 359: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 14Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. Wordeman L.G. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 303-313PubMed Google Scholar, 15Yen T.J. Li G.

Beech P.L. Katz S.G. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1313-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The chemical diversity of the MT surface could provide such specific positional and binding information in cells for many MT-interacting proteins. The large genetic and post-translational heterogeneity of the α- and β-tubulin subunits (for review see Refs. 17Sullivan K.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 687-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 18Murphy D.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Luduena R.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) can represent the molecular bases for such information. Indeed, we recently showed that polyglutamylation, the oligomeric post-translational modification of tubulin (20Eddá B. Rossier J. Le Caer J.-P. Desbruyères E. Gros F. Denoulet P.

Cell. 1994; 81: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), was involved in the regulation of Tau and MAP2 interaction with tubulin through a modulation of affinity as a function of the polyglutamyl chain length (24Boucher D. Larcher J.-C. Gros Denoulet P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12471-12477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Because, on one hand, the extension of the polyglutamyl chain from one to six units is thought to induce conformational changes in the carboxyl-terminal domain of both tubulin subunits, leading to the observed modulation of affinity for structural MAPs, and, on the other hand, all of the known MT-based motors (kinesin, kinesin-related proteins, and cytoplasmic and flagellar dyneins) have been reported to bind also in this carboxyl-terminal domain (25Paschal B.M.

We have analyzed the binding of different kinesin head motor domains (conventional rat kinesin (RK) and the Drosophila minus-end-directed kinesin-related protein (ncd, for nonclaret disjunctional)) to tubulin and investigated the influence of the degree of polyglutamylation of the various α- and β-tubulin isoforms on motor binding. In this paper, we report that the two types of motors bind in vitro to both α- and β-tubulin subunits and that this interaction appears to be controlled by polyglutamylation in the same manner as for Tau or MAP2. In addition, competition experiments carried out with several monoclonal antibodies and with kinesin heads and heat-stable MAPs indicate that the respective binding sites of structural and motor MAPs are independent from each other, although located in a sufficiently close vicinity on the tubulin molecule to undergo the same conformational control by polyglutamylation. The monoclonal antibodies DM1A and DM1B were purchased from Amersham Corp., Tau-1 was from Boehringer Mannheim, and anti-MAP2 was from Sigma. The monoclonals YL1/2 and YOL1/34 were generous gifts of Dr. J. Kilmartin (M.R.C. Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK). The polyclonal anti-HIPYR (14Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. Wordeman L.G. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 303-313PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. T. Mitchison (Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Francisco, CA). The GT335 monoclonal antibody was produced in our laboratory (27Wolff A. de Náchaud B. Chillet D. Mazarguil H. Desbruyères E. Audebert S. Eddá B. Gros F. Denoulet P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 425-432PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant motor domain constructs of rat kinesin (RK375 and RK329) and Drosophila ncd (HA-N333) were kindly provided by E.-M. Mandelkow and F. Kozielski (Max-Planck Unit for Structural Molecular Biology, Hamburg, Germany). RK375 and RK329 correspond to amino acids 1-379 and 1-329 of the rat kinesin sequence, respectively. HA-N333 corresponds to amino acids 333-700 of the Drosophila claret segregational protein sequence. Tubulin was prepared from a 100,000 × g supernatant of adult mouse brain by two cycles of assembly disassembly and further purified by phosphocellulose column chromatography (P11, Whatman) in MEM buffer (50 mM MES, pH 6.8, 2 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2) containing 1 mM Mg-GTP and a mixture of protease inhibitors (10 µg·ml-1 aprotinin, 10 µg·ml-1 leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Heat-stable MAPs (essentially Tau and MAP2) were routinely prepared from once cycled MTs, which were depolymerized at 4°C, cleared by centrifugation, brought to 0.5 M NaCl, and boiled for 5 min. Purified brain tubulin (1 mg·ml-1) was digested in MEM buffer with 1.25 or 5 µg·ml-1 subtilisin (Carlsberg, Sigma; 7-15 units·mg-1) for 45 min at 37°C, leading to a limited or a total digestion of tubulin, respectively. Reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and aliquots were processed by one-dimensional PAGE. Protein separation by one-dimensional or two-dimensional PAGE and immunodetection was carried out as described previously (24Boucher D. Larcher J.-C. Gros Denoulet P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12471-12477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 27Wolff A. de Náchaud B. Chillet D. Mazarguil H. Desbruyères E. Audebert S. Eddá B. Gros F. Denoulet P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 425-432PubMed Google Scholar) except that ampholytes 5-6 (Serva) were used in the isoelectric focusing dimension. Antibody binding was revealed by the ECL system (Amersham Corp.), and autoradiographs were quantified by scanning using a Vernon integrating densitometer. Binding of kinesin heads to tubulin separated by one-dimensional or two-dimensional PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C, Amersham Corp.) was performed essentially as described previously (24Boucher D. Larcher J.-C. Gros Denoulet P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12471-12477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Briefly, after monitoring of blotted tubulin by Ponceau red staining, strips corresponding to lanes of one-dimensional gels (or rectangles corresponding to tubulin regions of two-dimensional gels) were cut from the blots and placed into the grooves of a hand-made, Plexiglas incubation device adjusted to the size of the strips. Nitrocellulose pieces were blocked overnight in overlay buffer (OV = MEM buffer containing 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 0.1% (w/v) gelatin), incubated for 1 h at 20°C with the overlaying protein fraction, and then washed 5 × 10 min. Protein interactions were then stabilized with formaldehyde (24Boucher D. Larcher J.-C. Gros Denoulet P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12471-12477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) before the blots were equilibrated in TBS-T (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 136.8 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and processed for immunodetection. Phosphocellulose-purified tubulin (1 µg in 100 µl/well) was coated onto enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay multiwell microtiter plates (Nunc) in MEM buffer at 37°C. We checked by immunoassay that a constant amount of 500 ng was actually coated in each well according to the manufacturer. Wells were equilibrated and blocked overnight in OV then incubated with various concentrations of kinesin heads in 100 µl for 60 min at 25°C. Wells were rinsed with OV (5 × 5 min), and kinesin-tubulin interactions were stabilized with formaldehyde (24Boucher D. Larcher J.-C. Gros Denoulet P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12471-12477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). After equilibration in TBS-T, tubulin-bound kinesin was detected with anti-HIPYR 2 h at 37°C and a β-galactosidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit IgG (Biosys, France) 1 h at 37°C, using o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactoside (Sigma) as chromogen. Reactions were quantified automatically at 490 nm. MTs were polymerized from a whole brain supernatant in the presence of 20 µM Taxol and washed with 0.5 M NaCl to remove bound MAPs. MTs were pelleted, resuspended in MEM buffer, and used in micro-assays of kinesin head binding. MTs (60 pmol) were mixed with kinesin heads (50 pmol) in the absence or the presence of different nucleotides and salt in a final volume of 25 µl. After centrifugation (10 min at 25 p.s.i. in the A100 Airfuge rotor, Beckman), the whole pellet and supernatant proteins were analyzed by one-dimensional PAGE. RK329 and RK375 were suspended in MEM buffer (with or without 500 mM NaCl), cleared 10 min at 12,000 × g, and analyzed (separately or mixed) by gel filtration HPLC (Waters) on a TSK G3000 column (7.8 × 300 mm) equilibrated in MEM buffer and calibrated with standard proteins. Protein elution (1 ml·min-1) was monitored at 280 nm. Proteins from each collected fraction were analyzed by one-dimensional PAGE, detected by Coomassie blue staining and immunoprobed with anti-HIPYR antibodies. Increasing concentrations of RK head were overlaid onto a constant amount of tubulin separated by one-dimensional PAGE and immobilized onto nitrocellulose. Fig. 1A shows that RK head binding, detected on both α- and β-tubulin subunits with the specific anti-kinesin peptide (HIPYR) antibody, increased proportionally with RK concentration up to a saturation value. RK375 binding to both α- and β-tubulin was progressively inhibited when increasing concentrations of free tubulin were added to the overlay solution (Fig. 1B, left panel). A selective binding to both tubulin subunits was also observed when RK375 was overlaid onto whole supernatant proteins from brain (Fig. 1B, right panel). These results indicate that the tubulin-kinesin interactions occurring during the blot overlay procedure were specific. Likewise, the reverse, minus-end-directed motor head of ncd also bound to both α- and β-tubulin subunits (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the directionality of a kinesin motor protein along a MT is not determined by its selective interaction with a given α- or β-tubulin subunit. To assess the in vitro binding assay used in the preceding experiments, RK head binding was tested in the presence of nucleotides. Kinesin binding was progressively inhibited by increasing concentrations of GTP or of its hydrolyzable form, Mg-GTP (Fig. 2A). The effect of nucleotides on RK head binding was also tested using heterodimeric tubulin coated onto multiwell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates and taxol-stabilized MTs by a sedimentation assay. Fig. 2 (B and C) shows that in both cases the binding of RK heads was weakened by GTP, indicating that monomeric tubulin in the blot overlay assay behaves as heterodimeric or MT-assembled tubulin with respect to kinesin head binding. Formation of RK head-tubulin complexes was also readily prevented by raising the salt concentration in the incubation medium (Fig. 2, C and D). No interaction could be detected beyond 75 mM NaCl. Formation of kinesin-tubulin complexes was still effective, however, in the presence of 1 or 2 M urea (data not shown). These results indicate that kinesin-tubulin interactions occur mainly through electrostatic bonds. It is interesting to note that when MES was substituted by PIPES, the binding efficiency of kinesin to tubulin dropped severalfold. At 100 mM PIPES, a widely used buffer molarity, however, binding was faintly detectable, at levels 5-10 times lower than with 50 mM MES (data not shown). In all of these experiments where nucleotides, salt, chaotropic agent, or buffers were tested, the variation in the binding of RK heads was always similar for α- and β-tubulin subunits, indicating that the same basic binding features for kinesin were shared by both subunits, which in turn suggests the involvement of related sequences in orthologous domains in both subunits. When a truncated derivative of RK head, RK329, was overlaid onto immobilized tubulin (Fig. 3A), the resulting binding was estimated to be 5-10-fold lower than that obtained with the whole RK375 head. Although less efficiently, RK329 bound to both tubulin subunits at similar levels. The same difference in tubulin binding was observed when increasing concentrations of RK375 and RK329 were added to microwells coated with heterodimeric tubulin (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that amino acids 330-375 of RK are important for enhancing the interaction with tubulin. RK329 and RK375 were then analyzed by gel filtration chromatography to check the assembly state of each motor. Fig. 3, (C and D) shows that RK329 (calculated mass, 36.8 kDa) and RK375 (calculated mass, 42.7 kDa) each eluted as a single peak (retention times, 9.3 and 7.8 min, respectively) corresponding to globular polypeptides of Mr 37,200 and 120,000, respectively. Given the steric occupancy of a nonspherical, two-headed protein, these values are compatible with a dimerized state of RK375. When the column was run in 500 mM NaCl, RK375 eluted at the same position (Fig. 3C, dotted line). The salt resistance of RK375 dimers suggests that α-helical coiled-coil interactions could be involved between amino acids 330-375 of kinesin sequences (see Ref. 28Huang T.-G. Suhan J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16502-16507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and “Discussion”). Because polyglutamylation was previously shown to modulate the affinity of tubulin for the structural MAPs Tau and MAP2 (24Boucher D. Larcher J.-C. Gros Denoulet P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12471-12477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), we researched whether it could also be involved in the control of the binding of kinesin. Brain tubulin was separated by resolutive two-dimensional PAGE to physically space the different isoforms carrying an increasing number of glutamyl units (22Audebert S. Koulakoff A. Berwald-Netter Y. Gros F. Denoulet P. Eddá B. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2313-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Boucher D. Larcher J.-C. Gros Denoulet P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12471-12477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The different isotubulins were then probed for their ability to interact with kinesin. By comparison with the whole set of tubulin isoforms available on the nitrocellulose membrane (Fig. 4A), as detected with general anti-tubulin antibodies, Fig. 4B shows that RK375, immunodetected with anti-HIPYR, does not interact with the same efficiency with all of the different forms of tubulin. As previously observed for Tau (24Boucher D. Larcher J.-C. Gros Denoulet P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12471-12477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), kinesin interacted principally with moderately modified α- and β-isotubulins. The unmodified, more basic, primary translation products as well as the fully modified, more acidic isoforms only bound weakly, if at all, to kinesin. Because the type of response was similar for α- and β-tubulin and involved post-translationally derived tubulin isoforms, polyglutamylation appeared as the only obvious candidate responsible for this differential kinesin binding; it is the only modification that occurs on both tubulin subunits (Fig. 4C), and its oligomeric structure, which confers one to six negative charges to tubulin (20Eddá B. Rossier J. Le Caer J.-P. Desbruyères E. Gros F. Denoulet P. Science. 1990; 247: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 21Audebert S. Desbruyères E. Gruszczynski C. Koulakoff A. Gros F.

Cell. 1994; 81: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), can explain the progressive variation of RK binding observed as a function of tubulin acidification. It appears that addition of the first three glutamyl units increases the affinity of tubulin for kinesin, whereas further lengthening of the post-translational chain decreases it. To explain the influence of polyglutamylation on kinesin binding, an attempt was made to block the post-translational chains with a monoclonal antibody raised in our laboratory, GT335, which specifically recognizes the polyglutamylated motif on α- and β-tubulin (27Wolff A. de Náchaud B. Chillet D. Mazarguil H. Desbruyères E. Audebert S. Eddá B. Gros F. Denoulet P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 425-432PubMed Google Scholar). As a control, four other anti-tubulin monoclonal antibodies were used in parallel to block their respective epitopes, all located also in the carboxyl-terminal domain (Fig. 5F): the anti-tyrosinated α-tubulin YL1/2, the anti-α-tubulin YOL1/34, and two general anti-α- and anti-β-tubulin, DM1A and DM1B, respectively (29Breitling F. Little M. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 30Andreu J.M. de Pereda J.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 26: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Purified brain tubulin was separated by one-dimensional PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and progressively saturated by increasing concentrations of each monoclonal antibody. After extensive washing to eliminate unbound antibodies, membrane strips were overlaid with RK375, and tubulin-bound kinesin was detected with the polyclonal anti-HIPYR antibody and a peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG, to avoid any cross-reaction with the previously bound mouse IgG (Fig. 5, A-E). Increasing fixation of GT335 on the polyglutamyl chains progressively and rapidly inhibited kinesin binding on both tubulin subunits (Fig. 5A). A similar binding inhibition by GT335 was previously observed for Tau (24Boucher D. Larcher J.-C. Gros Denoulet P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12471-12477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Fixation of YL1/2 on its carboxyl-terminal tyrosylated epitope of α-tubulin did not significantly affect the binding of RK375 (Fig. 5B). Fixation of DM1A and DM1B interfered with kinesin binding on the α- and the β-tubulin subunit, respectively (Fig. 5, C and D), DM1A being much more efficient than DM1B in binding inhibition. In the presence of YOL1/34, a significant inhibition of RK binding to α-tubulin was also observed (Fig. 5E). In these experiments, binding of RK to β-tubulin in the presence of YL1/2, YOL1/34, or DM1A and to α-tubulin in the presence of DM1B served as internal controls. With antibody blocking experiments, it is difficult to know at first whether the observed inhibition is a direct effect, that is, a coincidence of the ligand binding site and the antibody epitope, or is due indirectly to a steric hindrance of the large IgG molecule, which can block the accessibility of adjacent binding sites. For the inhibition observed with GT335, at least, the corresponding epitopes can be easily removed by digesting tubulin with subtilisin (24Boucher D. Larcher J.-C. Gros Denoulet P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12471-12477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 31Serrano L.J. Avila J. Maccioni R.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4675-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 32Redecker V. Melki R. Promá D. Le Caer J.-P. Rossier J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In this case, after blot overlay with RK375 of partially or totally digested tubulin (Fig. 6), it appeared that kinesin still bound to cleaved (αS and βS) tubulin. Densitometric integration of the autoradiograms indicated that (i) RK375 interacted with the same efficiency with intact α- and β-tubulin, (ii) αS and βS bound less kinesin than uncleaved α- and β-subunit, respectively, and (iii) αS bound approximately two times less kinesin than βS. Although kinesin binding efficiency was decreased with subtilisin-cleaved tubulin, it is clear that RK375 did still bind to the carboxyl terminus-deleted tubulin, indicating that the kinesin binding sites are not located in the extreme carboxyl-terminal domain of tubulin but rather upstream of or even close to the subtilisin cleavage sites (Asp438 for α-tubulin and Gln433 for β-tubulin (32Redecker V. Melki R. Promá D. Le Caer J.-P. Rossier J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar)). Altogether, the results from Figs. 4, 5, and 6 suggest that polyglutamylation of tubulin controls kinesin binding through an indirect, conformational change of the carboxyl-terminal domain of tubulin, as previously reported for Tau or MAP2 binding (24Boucher D. Larcher J.-C. Gros Denoulet P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12471-12477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is relevant that compared with intact tubulin, kinesin binding is less affected than Tau binding by subtilisin cleavage (data not shown). Combined with the observations that DM1A prevented kinesin but not Tau binding and that both are under the same control by polyglutamylation, it can be concluded that the binding sites for kinesin and Tau are distinct, although sufficiently close together within the carboxyl-terminal domain. The Tau binding site would be downstream from that of kinesin, ending, at least, in the vicinity of the subtilisin cleavage site. To get information about the respective binding sites for structural and motor MAPs on the tubulin molecule and to know whether the different MAP classes can compete with each other, the following experiments were carried out. Constant amounts of tubulin were separated by one-dimensional PAGE and transferred onto three nitrocellulose membranes that were incubated with increasing concentrations of heat-stable MAP from brain (Fig. 7). As control, tubulin-bound Tau was detected and quantified on blot 1 using the monoclonal antibody Tau-1; as shown in Fig. 7 (dotted line), the Tau binding sites were effectively saturated from 4 µg·ml-1 onwards. On blot 2, a second overlay was performed with a constant amount of RK375; tubulin-bound kinesin was detected and quantified with anti-HIPYR. As illustrated in Fig. 7 (dashed line), the binding level of RK375 was constant and independent of the amount of Tau previously bound to tubulin, indicating that kinesin head interaction was not impeded by bound Tau. To rule out the possibility that bound Tau could have been displaced by RK375, blot 3 was processed as blot 2 except that tubulin-Tau interactions were stabilized with formaldehyde between the first overlay with Tau and the second with RK375 (Fig. 7, solid line). The comparison of the binding curves shows that stabilization of the tubulin-Tau complexes did not modify the constant interaction of RK375 with Tau-saturated tubulin. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that the binding sites for Tau and kinesin on the tubulin subunit molecules are independent. Kinesin is a plus-end-directed microtubule motor that binds to MTs with a longitudinal periodicity of 8 nm, corresponding to that of a tubulin dimer (33Harrison B.C. Marchese-Ragona S.P. Gilbert S.P.

https://openalex.org/W1998236766,"The 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) is a receptor antagonist that inhibits ligand interactions with the receptors that belong to the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family. Our previous studies have demonstrated that RAP interacts with the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) within the endoplasmic reticulum and prevents premature interaction of ligands with the receptor. To analyze whether RAP is also involved in the folding of LRP during receptor biosynthesis, we generated anchor-free, soluble minireceptors that represent each of the four putative ligand-binding domains of LRP (SLRP1, -2, -3, and -4, corresponding to the clusters with 2, 8, 10, and 11 cysteine-rich complement-type repeats, respectively). When these SLRPs were overexpressed by cell transfection, only SLRP1 was secreted. Little or no secretion was observed for SLRP2, -3, and -4. However, when RAP cDNA was cotransfected with SLRP2, -3, and -4 cDNAs, each of these SLRPs was secreted. The cellular retention of SLRPs in the absence of RAP coexpression appeared to be a result of the formation of SDS-resistant, oligomeric aggregates observed under nonreducing conditions. Such oligomers of the SLRPs likely resulted from formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds since they were reduced to monomers when analyzed under reducing conditions. The oligomers were formed not only among molecules of a given SLRP, but also between different SLRPs. The role of RAP in the process of LRP folding was shown by the reduction in aggregated SLRP oligomers upon RAP coexpression. A similar role of RAP in preventing the aggregation of newly synthesized receptor was also observed using membrane-containing minireceptor of LRP. Coimmunoprecipitation and ligand binding studies demonstrated that RAP binds avidly to SLRP2, -3, and -4, but not to SLRP1. These results suggest that these interactions may be important for proper folding of LRP by ensuring the formation of proper intradomain, but not intermolecular or interdomain, disulfide bonds. Thus, our results strongly suggest that, in addition to the prevention of premature binding of ligands to LRP, RAP also plays an important role in receptor folding. The 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) is a receptor antagonist that inhibits ligand interactions with the receptors that belong to the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family.

Such oligomers of the SLRPs likely resulted from formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds since they were reduced to monomers when analyzed under reducing conditions. The oligomers were formed not only among molecules of a given SLRP, but also between different SLRPs. The role of RAP in the process of LRP folding was shown by the reduction in aggregated SLRP oligomers upon RAP coexpression. A similar role of RAP in preventing the aggregation of newly synthesized receptor was also observed using membrane-containing minireceptor of LRP. Coimmunoprecipitation and ligand binding studies demonstrated that RAP binds avidly to SLRP2, -3, and -4, but not to SLRP1. These results suggest that these interactions may be important for proper folding of LRP by ensuring the formation of proper intradomain, but not intermolecular or interdomain, disulfide bonds. Thus, our results strongly suggest that, in addition to the prevention of premature binding of ligands to LRP, RAP also plays an important role in receptor folding. The 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) 1The abbreviations used are: RAPreceptor-associated proteinLRPlow density lipoprotein receptor-related proteinSLRPsoluble LRPMLRPmembrane-containing LRPERendoplasmic reticulumPCRpolymerase chain reactionHAhemagglutininPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is a potent inhibitor of endocytic receptors that belong to the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family. The four representative receptors in this family are the low density liproprotein receptor (Yamamoto et al., 28Yamamoto T. Davis G.C. Brown M.S. Schneider W.J. Casey M.L. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Cell. 1984; 39: 27-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar), the low density liproprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (Herz et al., 9Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S.K. Myklebost O.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9252-9256Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Among these receptors, LRP and gp330/megalin are large multifunctional receptors, each of which can bind and endocytose several structurally and functionally distinct ligands (for reviews, see Krieger and Herz (15Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar) and Kounnas et al. (14Kounnas M.Z. Stefansson S. Loukinova E. Argraves K.M. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S.

Upon binding to these receptors, RAP inhibits the binding and/or endocytosis of all the ligands by the receptors on the cell surface. This unique feature of RAP has allowed its extensive use in biological studies of these endocytic receptors, including the identification of novel receptor ligands. receptor-associated protein low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein soluble LRP membrane-containing LRP endoplasmic reticulum polymerase chain reaction hemagglutinin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Despite its use as a tool to study interactions of ligands with cell-surface receptors, the physiological function of RAP has not been defined. The possibility that RAP may regulate LRP activity on the cell surface is confounded by the fact that, although the amino acid sequence of RAP includes a putative signal peptide (Strickland et al., 21Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Battey F. Behre E. McTigue K. Battey J.F. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13364-13369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this protein is not present at the cell surface or secreted into the extracellular fluid. Our previous studies have shown that RAP is localized most abundantly within early compartments of the secretory pathway, which include the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cis-Golgi compartments (Bu et al., 2Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Geuze H. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29874-29882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that the carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide (HNEL) is responsible for the ER localization and retention (Bu et al., 3Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). RAP retained within the ER functions as a regulator of LRP activity by transiently interacting with LRP and maintaining LRP in an inactive ligand-binding state. As RAP dissociates from LRP in response to the lower pH within the Golgi compartment, LRP becomes active as it transits to the cell surface. The role of RAP in the maturation and trafficking of LRP is further supported by the gene knockout studies of Willnow et al. (26Willnow T.E. Armstrong S.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4537-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), which demonstrated that cells lacking RAP exhibit a 75% reduction of functional LRP. LRP is the largest endocytic receptor identified to date (~600 kDa). Ligands for this receptor, which include protease/protease inhibitors and lipoprotein particles, are diversified both structurally and functionally (Krieger and Herz, 15Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Such ligand diversity underscores the important role of LRP in various physiological processes, including its essentialness during embryonic development (Herz et al., 11Herz J. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. Cell. 1992; 78: 411-421Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Structurally, the ability of LRP to bind multiple ligands is facilitated by its large size and several independent ligand-binding domains. LRP is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain and cleaved in the trans-Golgi compartment into two subunits (Herz et al., 10Herz J. Kowal R.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar; Willnow et al., 27Willnow T.E. Moehring J.M. Inocencio N.M. Moehring T.J. Herz J. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The 515-kDa subunit contains all the putative ligand-binding domains and remains noncovalently associated with the 85-kDa subunit, which includes the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail. LRP contains 31 copies of complement-type ligand-binding repeats arranged in four clusters with 2, 8, 10, and 11 repeats, respectively (see Fig. 1) (Herz et al., 9Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S.K. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar; Krieger and Herz, 15Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Also present in its structure are 22 copies of cysteine-rich epidermal growth factor precursor-type repeats that flank the ligand-binding clusters. The complement-type repeats in LRP are similar to those in the low density liproprotein receptor, in which the 40-residue-long cysteine-rich repeats exhibit a highly conserved spacing pattern of 6 cysteine residues that form three intramolecular disulfide bonds (Goldstein et al., 7Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). The disulfide bonds are believed to be important for the stability of the ligand-binding sites on the receptor, particularly when the receptor traffics through the endosomes, where the acidic environment uncouples ligand from receptor. The complexity of LRP structure, largely due to the extensive intradomain disulfide bonds, presents a challenging task for proper folding during its biosynthesis. This process may well be assisted by molecular chaperone(s) within the ER. Since RAP is the only known protein that interacts with LRP within the ER, we examined the hypothesis that RAP may be involved in LRP folding in addition to its role in preventing premature binding of ligands to LRP. Thus, by constructing anchor-free, soluble minireceptors that represent each of the four putative ligand-binding domains of LRP (SLRPs) as well as membrane-containing minireceptor of LRP, we developed a system with which receptor folding and subsequent trafficking may be examined. Herein, we demonstrate that misfolded receptors that result from the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds are retained within the ER and that coexpression of RAP is both necessary and sufficient to prevent such misfolding. A PCR fragment encoding the LRP signal peptide and the first 5 amino acids was generated and cloned into HindIII and BamHI sites of the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The 3′-primer for this PCR fragment includes a built-in sequence encoding the amino acid sequence of the hemagglutinin (HA) tag (YPYDVPDYA) (Handley-Gearhart et al., 8Handley-Gearhart P.M. Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33171-33178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a linker restriction site (BamHI) encoding 2 extra amino acids (GS) (see Fig. 1B). The resulting plasmid, designated pcDNASLRP5′, was used as the base plasmid for the construction of cDNAs for each of the four SLRPs. The cDNA for each SLRP was generated by PCR and subcloned into BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNASLRP5′. All the restriction sites were included in the PCR primer sequences. The regions represented in the four SLRPs are marked in Fig. 1A and contain the following amino acid sequences: SLRP1, 6-171; SLRP2, 787-1244; SLRP3, 2462-3004; and SLRP4, 3274-3843. A plasmid containing the entire cDNA for human LRP was obtained from Dr. Joachim Herz (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas) and used as the PCR template. The following oligonucleotides were used for PCR amplification: for leader peptide, 5′-GATCAAGCTTTCAGCCCACACCATGCTGACCCCG-3′ and 5′-GATCGGATCCAGCGTAGTCCGGGACGTCGTACGGGTAAGGGGCGTCGATAGCCGCCGCGA-3′; for SLRP1, 5′-GATCGGATCCAAGACTTGCAGCCCCAAGCAGTTT-3′ and 5′-GATCCTCGAGCTAGGCCTTGCAGGAGCGGTTATCCG-3′; for SLRP2, 5′-GATCGGATCCAAATGCCGGGTGAACAATGGCGGC-3′ and 5′-GATCCTCGAGCTAGCTGCGGCAGCTCTCGCCGTCAG-3′; for SLRP3, 5′-GATCGGATCCCCATGCCGAATCAACAACGGTGGC-3′ and 5′-GATCCTCGAGCTAAGCCTTGCAGCTGTGGGGGTCGC-3′; and for SLRP4, 5′-GATCGGATCCCCCTGCAAGGTCAACAATGGTGGC-3′ and 5′-GATCCTCGAGCTAGGCCTTGCAGGTGTTGTGCGTCTT-3′. The membrane-containing LRP minireceptor 2 (MLRP2) includes the identical putative ligand-binding domain as SLRP2. An additional restriction site (EcoRI) was introduced to facilitate the ligation of the anchoring region of LRP. This region included part of the immediate extracellular domain (amino acids 3765-4400), the transmembrane domain (amino acids 4401-4425), and the entire region of the cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 4426-4525). The PCR primers for the anchoring region of LRP were 5′-GATAGAATTCAGCTGCGCCACCAATGCCAGCA-3′ and 5′-GATCCTCGAGCTATGCCAAGGGGTCCCCTATCTC-3′. The construction of cDNA for RAP (pcDNA-RAP) has been described previously (Bu et al., 3Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Human glioblastoma U87 cells were cultured in Earle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate and maintained at 37°C in humidified air containing 5% CO2 (Bu et al., 2Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Geuze H. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29874-29882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For transient transfection, U87 cells were transfected with various plasmids at 40-60% confluence using a calcium phosphate precipitation method (Chen and Okayama, 5Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). For each well of 6-well dishes (3.5 cm in diameter), 10 µg of DNA were used in a total volume of 4 ml of medium. Sixteen h after the start of transfection, cells were washed with medium and cultured continuously for an additional 24 h before use in experiments. The efficiency of transient transfection in these studies was consistently ~20% as assessed by immunofluorescent staining of expressed proteins. Metabolic labeling with [35S]cysteine was performed essentially as described previously (Bu et al., 3Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). For pulse-chase experiments, cells were pulse-labeled and chased with serum-containing medium for different periods of time as specified in each experiment. A PCR fragment encoding the complement-type cysteine-rich repeats of the second ligand-binding cluster of LRP (LRP2, amino acids 826-1165) was generated and cloned into BamHI and EcoRI sites of the fusion protein expression vector pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Restriction sites for subcloning were included in PCR primer sequences. The two oligonucleotides used for PCR amplification were 5′-CCGCGTGGATCCAACCCATCCTACGTGCCTCCA-3′ and 5′-TCAATGAATTCCTCACTGGTCGCAGAGCTCGCCCTCATC-3′. The glutathione S-transferase-LRP2 fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using glutathionine-agarose beads and standard techniques. The fusion protein was then cleaved with thrombin, and recombinant LRP2 was repurified by removing glutathione S-transferase using glutathionine-agarose beads. Polyclonal anti-RAP and anti-LRP antibodies have been described previously (Bu et al., 3Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-HA antibody was obtained from BAbCo (12CA5). Polyclonal anti-LRP2 antibody (specific for domain 2 of LRP) was generated in rabbit using recombinant LRP2 as described above. Immunoprecipitations were carried out essentially as described previously (Bu et al., 1Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13002-13009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except the washing buffer for monoclonal anti-HA antibody contained 0.1% SDS instead of 1% SDS. In the case of coimmunoprecipitation using anti-RAP antibody, SDS was omitted from the washing buffer. Preliminary experiments were performed to ensure that the primary antibody used in each immunoprecipitation was in excess. Protein A-agarose beads were used to precipitate protein-IgG complexes. The immunoprecipitated material was released from the beads by boiling each sample for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) (Laemmli, 17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). If the immunoprecipitated material was analyzed under reducing conditions, 5% (v/v) β-mecaptoethanol was included in the Laemmli sample buffer. The percentage of SDS-polyacrylamide gels is indicated in each figure legend. Rainbow molecular mass markers (Bio-Rad) were used as the molecular mass standards. Iodination of RAP has been described previously (Bu et al., 1Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13002-13009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Media from either mock- or SLRP-transfected cells were collected and incubated with 125I-RAP (3 nM) in the absence or presence of excess unlabeled RAP (1 µM). SLRPs with or without the interaction with 125I-RAP were then immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody in the absence of SDS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The putative ligand-binding domains of LRP are cysteine-rich with extensive disulfide bonds. To analyze the folding and subsequent trafficking of LRP, we constructed soluble receptor molecules corresponding to each of the four putative ligand-binding domains (designated SLRP1, -2, -3, and -4) using PCR techniques (Fig. 1A). Each of these SLRPs consists of the signal peptide, the first 5 amino acids after the signal peptide cleavage site, a 9-amino acid HA tag, and the designated ligand-binding domain (Fig. 1B). The HA tag was designed to facilitate the immunodetection of each of the four SLRPs (Handley-Gearhart et al., 8Handley-Gearhart P.M. Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33171-33178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regions that represent the putative ligand-binding domains include the entire continuous complement-type repeats and those epidermal growth factor precursor-type repeats that immediately flank the complement-type repeats (Herz et al., 9Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S.K. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar) and contain the following amino acid sequences: SLRP1, 6-171; SLRP2, 787-1244; SLRP3, 2462-3004; and SLRP4, 3274-3843. To analyze the expression of these SLRPs, cDNAs for these constructs were transiently transfected into human glioblastoma U87 cells (Bu et al., 2Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Geuze H. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29874-29882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After transfection, cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine for 4 h, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either polyclonal anti-LRP antibody or monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1C, in addition to endogenous full-length LRP, anti-LRP antibody effectively immunoprecipitated SLRP2, -3, and -4 (lanes 2-4), but not SLRP1 (lane 1), indicating that our polyclonal anti-LRP antibody recognizes regions that reside within putative ligand-binding domains 2, 3, and 4, but not domain 1. The expression of SLRP1 in U87 cells was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody (lane 5), which also immunoprecipitated SLRP2, -3, and -4 (lanes 6-8), but not endogenous LRP. The molecular sizes of each of the four SLRPs correlate with those predicted from the number of amino acid residues and the number of putative N-linked glycosylation sites. Of note, although it consists of fewer amino acid residues, SLRP3 (559 amino acids) exhibited a higher apparent molecular mass compared with SLRP4 (586 amino acids), presumably due to the contribution of additional N-linked glycosylation (seven putative sites in SLRP3 versus five in SLRP4). To analyze whether SLRPs are secreted when overexpressed in U87 cells, we performed pulse-chase metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation analysis. After transient transfection with cDNAs for each of the four SLRPs, U87 cells were metabolically pulse-labeled with [35S]cysteine for 1 h and chased for 3 h. Both media and cell lysates were quantitatively immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2A, except for SLRP1, little or no secretion of SLRP2, -3, and -4 was detected, indicating that folding and/or trafficking of these SLRPs was impaired when overexpressed. Similar results were obtained when these cDNAs were transfected into several other cell lines (e.g. HepG2 and COS cells) (data not shown). To analyze whether coexpression of RAP can rescue the cellular retention of SLRPs, we performed cotransfection of cDNAs for SLRPs and RAP, followed with pulse-chase metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation. When RAP was coexpressed, SLRP2, -3, and -4 all exhibited significant secretion (Fig. 2B), whereas no significant effect was observed for the secretion of SLRP1. The secreted SLRPs exhibited slower mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel when compared with their corresponding species in cell lysates. This was likely due to the addition of complex carbohydrates as these proteins trafficked through the trans-Golgi compartment en route to secretion. Since RAP was not labeled with [35S]cysteine (the RAP sequence does not contain cysteine), the expression of RAP in transfected cells was analyzed by Western blotting. We found that the expression of RAP was typically ~50-fold higher than that of endogenous RAP in cotransfected U87 cells when compared with untransfected U87 cells. Shown in Fig. 2C is an example of an anti-RAP Western blot of cells cotransfected with cDNAs for SLRP2 and either vector pcDNA (first lane) or pcDNA-RAP (second lane) (Bu et al., 3Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Thus, endogenous RAP in U87 cells may well have been limiting when SLRPs were overexpressed. To confirm the requirement for coexpression of RAP for SLRP secretion, we focused on SLRP2 and performed kinetic analyses of its secretion. SLRP2 cDNA was cotransfected into U87 cells with either vector pcDNA (Fig. 3A, -RAP) or pcDNA-RAP (Fig. 3B, +RAP). The transfected cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]cysteine for 1 h and chased for 1, 3, or 5 h. After each chase, media and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 3A, little secretion of SLRP2 was seen in the absence of RAP even after 5 h of chase, whereas SLRP2 was readily secreted in RAP-cotransfected cells with kinetics typical of a secretory protein. By the end of 5 h of chase, >70% of radiolabeled SLRP2 had been secreted into the medium. To explore the potential mechanisms by which RAP coexpression ensures the secretion of SLRPs, we analyzed the cellularly retained SLRPs via metabolic labeling and SDS-PAGE. Interestingly, in the absence of RAP coexpression, we observed high molecular mass, SDS-resistant oligomers for SLRP2, -3, and -4, but not for SLRP1, when analyzed under nonreducing conditions. Shown in Fig. 4 are SLRP2 and SLRP3 analyzed under either nonreducing or reducing conditions after their expression via transfection and metabolic labeling. In these experiments, U87 cells were transfected with cDNAs for SLRP2 (lanes 1), SLRP3 (lanes 2), or both (lanes 3) and metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine for 4 h. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with either anti-HA antibody (Fig. 4, A and B) or anti-LRP2 antibody (Fig. 4, C and D) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under either nonreducing (Fig. 4, A and C) or reducing (Fig. 4, B and D) conditions. As shown in Fig. 4A, when analyzed under nonreducing conditions, both SLRP2 and SLRP3 appeared, in addition to monomers, as various oligomers (i.e. dimer, trimer, and multimers) and migrated as slowly as those observed on top of the stacking gel. These oligomers appeared to be SDS-resistant since they were not diminished after immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE analysis in the presence of SDS (1-2%). However, when these oligomers were analyzed under reducing conditions, all species collapsed to monomer form (Fig. 4B). This suggests that all oligomer forms likely resulted from intermolecular disulfide linkages. To determine whether disulfide bonds can be formed between different SLRPs, we employed an antibody to LRP that was generated using recombinant domain 2 of LRP. As shown in Fig. 4 (C and D), anti-LRP2 antibody specifically immunoprecipitated SLRP2 (lanes 1), but not SLRP3 (lanes 2). However, SLRP3 was coimmunoprecipitated with anti-SLRP2 antibody from cells that had been cotransfected with cDNAs for both SLRP2 and SLRP3. This observation suggests that these SLRP3 molecules were associated with the coexpressed SLRP2 molecules via interdomain disulfide linkages. Thus, misfolding of LRP may include intermolecular disulfide bonds between identical domains or between different domains as well as interdomain disulfide bonds within a given LRP molecule. To analyze the potential role of RAP in the folding process of LRP, we examined the effects of RAP coexpression on oligomerization of the SLRPs. Shown in Fig. 5A is metabolically labeled SLRP2 in the absence or presence of RAP coexpression and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. As shown in Fig. 5A, oligomers of SLRP2 in the absence of RAP coexpression (lane 1) were similar to those observed in Fig. 4. However, when RAP was coexpressed (lane 2), SLRP2 migrated predominantly as the monomer, with few oligomers seen. This differential appearance of SLRP2 was not due to differential rates of protein synthesis since the level of newly synthesized SLRP2 was similar in the absence and presence of RAP coexpression (Fig. 5B, compare lanes 1 and 2). Similar effects of RAP coexpression on the prevention of oligomerized SLRPs were also observed for SLRP3 and SLRP4 (data not shown). The involvement of RAP in the folding process of LRP requires direct interaction of this chaperone protein with the receptor. Thus, we analyzed the potential interactions of RAP with each of the four putative ligand-binding domains of LRP using SLRPs. Two separate approaches were employed for these analyses. First, we examine the ability of RAP to coimmunoprecipitate each of the four SLRPs following transfection and metabolic labeling. Our previous studies have demonstrated that our affinity-purified anti-RAP IgG is specific for RAP, with no cross-reactivity with other cellular proteins (Bu et al., 2Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Geuze H. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29874-29882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with cDNAs for each of the four SLRPs in the absence or presence of cotransfection of the cDNA for RAP (Fig. 6). The transfected cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine for 4 h and immunoprecipitated with either anti-HA antibody or anti-RAP antibody in the absence of SDS (Bu et al., 3Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The expression of the SLRPs was similar to that shown in Fig. 1C when immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody (data not shown). Consistent with previous results (Bu et al., 3Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), endogenous LRP was coimmunoprecipitated with RAP under each transfection condition. However, only SLRP2, -3, and -4 (Fig. 6, lanes 3-8), but not SLRP1 (lanes 1 and 2), were coimmunoprecipitated with RAP. Coexpression of RAP resulted in a significant increase in the amounts of coimmunoprecipitated SLRPs (compare lanes 4 and 3, 6 and 5, and 8 and 7), indicating that endogenous RAP in U87 cells was limiting in the presence of overexpressed SLRPs. In addition, more SLRP2 and -4 molecules were coimmunoprecipitated with RAP compared with SLRP3, suggesting that these regions of LRP may exhibit higher affinity and/or contain multiple binding sites for RAP. The second approach involved in vitro analysis of 125I-RAP interaction with secreted SLRPs. U87 cells were cotransfected with cDNAs for each of the four SLRPs and for RAP. Media containing the secreted SLRPs were collected and incubated with exogenously added 125I-RAP. Medium from vector-transfected U87 cells was used as a negative control. Potential 125I-RAP·SLRP complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, and the ability of each of the four SLRPs to coprecipitate 125I-RAP was assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis. As shown in Fig. 7, SLRP2, -3, and -4, but not SLRP1, interacted with 125I-RAP. These interactions appeared to be specific since 125I-RAP was not precipitated in the presence of excess unlabeled RAP. Consistent with experiments shown in Fig. 6, SLRP2 and -4 bound more RAP (i.e. exhibited higher affinities and/or multiple binding sites) compared with SLRP3. Thus, these results clearly demonstrate that multiple domains of LRP can independently interact with its chaperone protein, RAP. To analyze whether RAP plays the same role in receptor folding for membrane-containing minireceptors of LRP (MLRP), we constructed a MLRP that corresponds to SLRP2 with the inclusion of the immediate extracellular domain, the transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic tail of LRP (MLRP2) (see “Material and Methods” for the construction of cDNA). To analyze whether MLRP2 can interact with RAP, we transfected U87 cells with cDNAs for MLRP2 and RAP. The transfected cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine for 4 h, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either anti-HA antibody or anti-RAP antibody (Fig. 8A). As shown in Fig. 8A, anti-HA antibody effectively immunoprecipitated MLRP2, which exhibited the expected molecular mass (~160 kDa). Although the construction of MLRP2 included the authentic proteolytic site (Herz et al., 10Herz J. Kowal R.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), little processing of this minireceptor was seen. This was likely due to the limitation of available protease for processing when MLRP2 was overexpressed. Similar to SLRP2 (Fig. 6), both endogenous LRP and MLRP2 were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-RAP antibody. To examine the effects of RAP coexpression on the potential aggregation of MLRP2, we transfected U87 cells with the cDNA for MLRP2 with the cotransfection of cDNA for either vector pcDNA (Fig. 8B, lane 1) or pcDNA-RAP (lane 2). The transfected cells were then metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine for 4 h. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under either nonreducing or reducing conditions. Similar to the role of RAP for SLRP2, oligomers of MLRP2 (mostly migrating on top of the gel) were seen in the absence of RAP coexpression under nonreducing conditions (lane 1). However, when RAP was coexpressed (lane 2), MLRP2 migrated predominantly as the monomer, with significantly reduced oligomers. When analyzed under reducing conditions, MLRP2 migrated slightly slower on SDS gel in the presence of RAP coexpression, likely due to differential glycosylations within the ER. Thus, RAP appears to be capable of preventing the aggregation of both soluble and membrane-containing minireceptors of LRP. The important roles of RAP in the post-translational folding and/or trafficking of LRP have been recently reported in two independent studies. Our previous studies have shown that RAP interacts with LRP early within the secretory pathway and inhibits premature interaction of its ligands with LRP (Bu et al., 3Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Studies by Willnow et al. (26Willnow T.E. Armstrong S.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4537-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) have shown that disruption of the gene for RAP results in a significant reduction of functional LRP in liver and brain. However, the mechanism(s) responsible for the requirements of RAP in the functional expression of LRP have not been established. Given the present results, it is likely that, in the absence of RAP, the proper folding of LRP is partially impaired due to the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. Such covalent cross-linking of multiple molecules can in turn result in the oligomerization and aggregation of newly synthesized receptors. In the case of SLRPs, aggregation of these minireceptors prevents them from being secreted, likely due to the quality control systems within the ER. Indeed, when we analyzed the effects of dithiothreitol on the folding and secretion of SLRPs, we found that dithiothreitol completely eliminated the formation of disulfide bonds, but exhibited little effect on the secretion of SLRPs (data not shown). In addition, such misfolding events may be significant only in cells where LRP is highly expressed. In this regard, it is interesting to note that significant reduction of LRP in RAP-deficient mice was observed mainly in tissues and cells that express high levels of LRP (e.g. liver and brain). 2T. E. Willnow, personal communication. In tissue and cells that express low levels of LRP, such abnormal intermolecular disulfide bonds may be minimal in the absence of RAP due to lower amounts of receptor along the secretory pathway. Thus, it will be of interest to examine the nature of molecular aggregations of LRP in various tissues and cell types from RAP knockout mice. The mechanisms responsible for the involvement of RAP in intradomain disulfide bond formation of LRP are not clear at present. However, the observation that RAP may interact with multiple domains of LRP suggests that RAP may serve as a chaperone by maintaining regions of the receptor in a given state so as to prevent incorrect disulfide bond formation and/or to guide the proper alignment of correct disulfide bonds. Thus, the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds in the absence of RAP may be a result of misrecognition of cysteine residues located within different molecules by protein-disulfide isomerase. In addition, the challenge for the formation of correct disulfide bonds during folding also lies within the LRP molecule, as inappropriate bond formation may occur both between LRP molecules as well as between domains of the same molecule. In addition to the role of RAP in LRP folding, the timing of folding for each domain may also be crucial. For example, domains translated early may complete their folding prior to the translation of subsequent domains. Herein, the participation of RAP may be more significant when the receptor is highly expressed, and the protein-disulfide isomerase may be limiting. Under these circumstances, the kinetics of the formation of disulfide bonds may be much slower, and the timing for the folding of each domain may be altered. Thus, under these circumstances, interdomain disulfide bonds may only be prevented by the interaction of RAP with the receptor. Although membrane anchoring may affect the trafficking of proteins due to bulk membrane flow (Burgess and Kelly, 4Burgess T.L. Kelly R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 3: 243-293Crossref Scopus (756) Google Scholar; Klausner, 13Klausner R. Cell. 1989; 57: 703-706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), soluble and membrane-bound proteins generally undergo similar post-translational folding and modifications along the secretory pathway. Since the folding of newly synthesized proteins often occurs concomitantly with translation, the role of the membrane in the folding process may be minimal. Thus, soluble recombinant receptors such as those used in this study may be useful in analysis of the folding process of membrane-bound proteins. Indeed, our results indicated that RAP exhibits similar roles in preventing the aggregation of both soluble and membrane-containing minireceptors of LRP. Similar types of analyses using soluble recombinant protein in the folding and trafficking of other membrane-bound glycoproteins have been performed (Gething and Sambrook, 6Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1982; 300: 598-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar; Singh et al., 20Singh I. Doms R.W. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Misfolded proteins often result in molecular aggregation and subsequent ER retention. A delay in the secretion of soluble proteins is in turn often a result of misfolding. In this regard, the soluble receptor systems described in this study should provide a useful strategy to dissect the structural elements within RAP and/or LRP that are important for the chaperone function of RAP in receptor folding. For example, we have shown that there are three independent domains within RAP, each of which may independently interact with LRP (Bu et al., 3Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar; Warshawsky et al., 24Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3404-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to examine whether a given independent domain itself is capable of performing the chaperone function during receptor folding. It is certainly possible that the chaperone function requires multiple interactions of RAP with the receptor in order to maintain a proper conformation for correct receptor folding. Previous studies by Willnow et al. (25Willnow T.E. Orth K. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15827-15832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that RAP interacts with domains 2 and 4 of LRP (Willnow et al., 25Willnow T.E. Orth K. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15827-15832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the ability of domains 1 and 3 to interact with RAP was not evaluated. In this study, we extended these observations and demonstrated that domains 2, 3, and 4, but not domain 1, of LRP can independently interact with RAP. However, the interactions of domains 2 and 4 were much stronger than that of domain 3. Such differential interactions may result from higher affinities and/or multiple binding sites of RAP within each LRP domain. The latter possibility would be consistent with ligand binding studies previously reported from our laboratory (Iadonato et al., 12Iadonato S.P. Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Using cell-surface saturation binding analyses, we have shown that there are approximately six to seven RAP-binding sites for each LRP molecule. Thus, domains 2 and 4 of LRP may well contain multiple RAP-binding sites. Furthermore, this notion is consistent with the fact that LRP domain 2 contains multiple ligand-binding sites, including those for tissue plasminogen activator-plasminogen activator inhibitor complexes (Willnow et al., 25Willnow T.E. Orth K. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15827-15832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and α2-macroglobulin (Moestrup et al., 16Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Nykjaer A. Andreasen P.A. Rasmussen H.H. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13691-13696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these ligand-binding sites within domain 2 of LRP may overlap with an independent RAP-binding site (Warshawsky et al., 23Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3325-3330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precise stoichiometry of RAP-binding sites within each domain of LRP awaits future studies. Due to the nature of transient transfection, the effects of overexpression of SLRPs on endogenous LRP are not clear (the majority of LRP seen in our experiments was derived from untransfected cells). In future studies, the affinity of RAP for endogenous LRP versus the single domain of LRP should be directly compared using stably SLRP-transfected cell lines. The extremely large size and complicated domain structure of LRP suggest that the folding process of this receptor may be a much more complicated process than our current understanding allows. In this regard, although RAP is the only known protein currently identified to interact with LRP within the ER, other chaperones (e.g. immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein and calnexin) may well be involved in the folding process of the receptor. Identification of such chaperones should significantly aid in understanding the folding process both of LRP and of proteins in general. In summary, we have demonstrated that RAP interacts with multiple domains of LRP. Such interactions appear to be important in the prevention of formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds during receptor folding and subsequently in the premature binding of ligands to the receptor during trafficking along the secretory pathway. The soluble receptor systems described in this study should be useful not only for the study of receptor folding, but also for the mapping of ligand-binding sites within LRP.

https://openalex.org/W2026299299,"We examined the structure-function relationship of human lipoprotein lipase (hLPL) in its ability to enhance the binding and catabolism of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) in COS cells. Untransfected COS cells did not bind to or catabolize normal VLDL. Expression of wild-type hLPL by transient transfection enhanced binding, uptake, and degradation of the VLDL (a property of LPL that we call bridge function). Heparin pretreatment and a monoclonal antibody ID7 that blocks LDL receptor-binding domain of apoE both inhibited binding, and apoE2/E2 VLDL from a Type III hyperlipidemic subject did not bind. However, LDL did not reduce 125I-VLDL binding to the hLPL-expressing cells, whereas rabbit β-VLDL was an effective competitor. By contrast, LDL reduced uptake and degradation of 125I-VLDL to the same extent as excess unlabeled VLDL or β-VLDL. These data suggest that binding occurs by direct interaction of VLDL with LPL but the subsequent catabolism of the VLDL is mediated by the LDL receptor. Mutant hLPLs that were catalytically inactive, S132A, S132D, as well as the partially active mutant, S251T, and S172G, gave normal enhancement of VLDL binding and catabolism, whereas the partially active mutant S172D had markedly impaired capacity for the process; thus, there is no correlation between bridge function and lipolytic activity. A naturally occurring genetic variant hLPL, S447→Ter, has normal bridge function. The catalytic center of LPL is covered by a 21-amino acid loop that must be repositioned before a lipid substrate can gain access to the active site for catalysis. We studied three hLPL loop mutants (LPL-cH, an enzymatically active mutant with the loop replaced by a hepatic lipase loop; LPL-cP, an enzymatically inactive mutant with the loop replaced by a pancreatic lipase loop; and C216S/C239S, an enzymatically inactive mutant with the pair of Cys residues delimiting the loop substituted by Ser residues) and a control double Cys mutant, C418S/C438S. Two of the loop mutants (LPL-cH and LPL-cP) and the control double Cys mutant C418S/C438S gave normal enhancement of VLDL binding and catabolism, whereas the third loop mutant, C216S/C239S, was completely inactive. We conclude that although catalytic activity and the actual primary sequence of the loop of LPL are relatively unimportant (wild-type LPL loop and pancreatic lipase loops have little sequence similarity), the intact folding of the loop, flanked by disulfide bonds, must be maintained for LPL to express its bridge function."

Vav contains an array of signaling and protein-protein interaction motifs, including Dbl and pleckstrin homology domains and a carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain flanked by two SH3 domains (33Bustelo X.

Point mutations within the Vav SH2 domain inhibit its transforming potential (38Katzav S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1757-1763PubMed Google Scholar), implicating this domain in Vav-mediated signaling pathways. In this regard, Vav has been shown to interact with other signaling molecules, including Shc, Grb2, ZAP-70, VAP-1, CD19, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85), through SH2- and/or SH3-mediated interactions after T or B cell activation (33Bustelo X.

We therefore wished to determine whether or not CD45 isoform-specific differences in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav were associated with the differential interaction of Vav with downstream signaling molecules. Utilizing our model system, whereby different single CD45 isoforms are uniquely expressed in Jurkat cells whose endogenous CD45 expression has been blocked by an antisense gene, we noted that a 76-kDa protein associates with Vav and also undergoes activation-induced isoform-dependent phosphorylation on tyrosine. We have now identified this Vav-associated molecule as SLP-76, a recently cloned protein that binds Grb2 in T cells (43Jackman J.K. Motto D.G. Sun Q. Tanemoto M. Turck C.W. Peltz G.A. Koretzky G.A. Findell P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7029-7032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that SLP-76 undergoes CD45 isoform-dependent differential phosphorylation and recruitment to Vav through the Vav SH2 and SH3 domains. These results further delineate both Vav-mediated and CD45 isoform-specific signaling pathways resulting from T cell activation. As described previously (30McKenney D.W. Onodera H. Gorman L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24949-24954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), endogenous CD45 expression was blocked in the Jurkat human leukemic CD4+ T cell line by stable transfection with an antisense plasmid construct targeting a region just upstream of the CD45 initiation codon. One G418-resistant clone (J-AS-1), completely lacking surface or cytoplasmic CD45, was stably cotransfected with cDNAs encoding the smallest (CD45(0)) or the largest (CD45(ABC)) isoform plus pPGKhyg (encoding hygromycin B resistance) (30McKenney D.W.

Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% iron-fortified calf serum, L-glutamine, and gentamycin.

Immunoprecipitations were performed as described (30McKenney D.W. Onodera H. Gorman L. Mimura T. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol.

Briefly, after preclearing, equivalent amounts of protein from each lysate (Bio-Rad DC protein assay) were incubated with anti-Vav or anti-SLP-76, followed by immunoprecipitation with protein A-Sepharose or GammaBind Plus Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), respectively. After extensive washing, immunoprecipitates were subjected to 8-12% SDS-PAGE (reducing conditions), transferred to nitrocellulose, and blocked with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline. Membranes were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) mAb 4G10 (provided by Dr. B. Drucker, University of Oregon Health Sciences Center, Portland, OR), anti-Vav mAb, or anti-SLP-76 sheep serum, followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab, and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (DuPont NEN). Constructs encoding GST fusion proteins contained the following portions of Vav: SH2+SH3(COOH) (from Dr. B. Margolis, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI), SH2 (from Dr. A. Altman, with permission of Dr. S. Katzav, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel), and SH3(COOH) (from Dr. X. Bustelo). Fusion proteins were induced in transformed Escherichia coli DH5α cells with 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside and affinity-purified using glutathione-agarose (Sigma). Purified proteins were quantitated by comparison with protein standards on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For precipitation, agarose-associated GST fusion proteins (2.5-10 µg) were incubated with cell lysates (0.25 ml) for 3 h at 4°C, extensively washed in high salt (500 mM LiCl) and plain lysis buffers, and then immunoblotted as described above. The Jurkat human leukemic T cell line normally expresses CD45 at high levels. Like other T lymphocytes, individual cells express multiple isoforms simultaneously (5Rothstein D.M. Saito H. Streuli M. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7139-7147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30McKenney D.W. Onodera H. Gorman L. Mimura T. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24949-24954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To examine the role of CD45 and its individual isoforms free from potential confounding influences of unknown mutations, we directly targeted endogenous CD45 expression in Jurkat cells by stable transfection of a CD45 antisense construct (30McKenney D.W. Onodera H. Gorman L. Mimura T. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24949-24954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). One resulting CD45- clone, J-AS-1, was then stably transfected with cDNA encoding either the smallest isoform, denoted CD45(0), which lacks alternative exons, or the largest isoform, denoted CD45(ABC), which includes all three alternative exons. Two transfectants uniquely expressing CD45(ABC) (clones J[ABC]-1 and -2) and three transfectants expressing CD45(0) (clones J[0]-1, -2, and -3) (30McKenney D.W. Onodera H. Gorman L. Mimura T. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24949-24954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) were used in this study. Although total CD45 expression was higher in wild-type Jurkat cells than in the transfectants, the expression of individual CD45(0) and CD45(ABC) isoforms by J[0] and J[ABC] cells, respectively, was similar to their expression in wild-type cells (30McKenney D.W. Onodera H. Gorman L. Mimura T. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24949-24954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Overall, CD45 expression in J[0] and J[ABC] cells was similar. The expression of other cell-surface molecules, including CD2, CD3, CD4, and CD28, was comparable between cell lines (data not shown). Using these cell lines, we previously reported CD45 isoform-associated differences in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav (30McKenney D.W. Onodera H. Gorman L. Mimura T. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24949-24954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Activation-induced tyrosine phosphorylation directs SH2-mediated interactions between Vav and a number of other signaling molecules that are likely to be important in Vav-mediated signaling (33Bustelo X. Barbacid M. Science. 1992; 256: 1196-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 39Ramos-Morales F. Drucker B. Fischer S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1917-1923PubMed Google Scholar, 40Katzav S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32514-32521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore wished to determine whether the differential tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav resulting from the expression of distinct CD45 isoforms was associated with differential phosphorylation and/or interaction with other signaling molecules. As before, anti-CD3 stimulation consistently induced significantly greater tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav in Jurkat cells and particularly in J[ABC] transfectants compared with J[0] transfectants or the CD45- J-AS-1 cells (Fig. 1A). Reprobing the same membrane with anti-Vav mAb confirmed similar precipitation of Vav protein in each lane (Fig. 1B). In addition, we noted that a 76-kDa phosphoprotein (pp76) is consistently coprecipitated with Vav from Nonidet P-40 lysates and follows exactly the same pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation as Vav (Fig. 1A). Thus, Vav-associated pp76 is phosphorylated on tyrosine after T cell activation and undergoes relative hyperphosphorylation in Jurkat and CD45(ABC)-expressing transfectants compared with transfectants expressing CD45(0) or lacking CD45 altogether. This same pattern was also observed 5 min after stimulation of each cell line, at which time diminished tyrosine phosphorylation of both proteins is usually observed (data not shown). We found that pp76 can be coprecipitated by antibodies directed against several different regions of Vav (data not shown). Whereas each of these antisera recognizes Vav by immunoblotting, none recognizes Vav-associated pp76, indicating that this molecule is not a proteolytic cleavage product of Vav. Thus, pp76 is specifically coprecipitated with Vav and, like Vav, exhibits CD45 isoform-specific phosphorylation after cellular activation. Additional proteins of 65 and 70 kDa were often coprecipitated with Vav, but these bands were variable and did not routinely exhibit CD45 isoform-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation. This emphasizes the selective nature of isoform-specific signals. The band at 70 kDa may correspond to ZAP-70, reported by others to associate with Vav (40Katzav S. Sutherland M. Packham G. Yi T. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32579-32585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We next examined the time course of Vav and Vav-associated pp76 tyrosine phosphorylation after anti-CD3 stimulation of Jurkat cells (Fig. 2). Both molecules are rapidly phosphorylated, reaching a maximum by 30 s to 1 min. The dephosphorylation of both bands also follow similar kinetics. Although the rate of dephosphorylation showed some interassay variability, a gradual decrease in phosphorylation of both bands was usually noticeable by 5-10 min. Thus, as determined by anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting of Vav immunoprecipitates, the phosphorylation of Vav and Vav-associated pp76 parallel one another. Taken together with the CD45 isoform-specific differences in phosphorylation, these data suggest that pp76 and Vav phosphorylation could be linked to the same protein-tyrosine kinase pathway whose activity depends upon CD45, but is differentially regulated by distinct CD45 isoforms. Of course, these studies do not distinguish between increased pp76 phosphorylation and increased recruitment to Vav. Therefore, it is also possible that CD45 isoform-dependent phosphorylation of Vav may result in increased recruitment of pp76, whose phosphorylation is regulated in a manner unrelated to the phosphorylation of Vav. To map the sites of interaction between Vav and pp76, GST-Vav fusion proteins were used. A GST fusion protein containing the Vav SH2 domain plus the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain (GST-Vav-SH2+SH3(COOH)) does precipitate some tyrosine-phosphorylated pp76 from unstimulated cell lysates (Fig. 3). However, the precipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated pp76 by GST-Vav-SH2+SH3(COOH) or by a fusion protein containing the Vav SH2 domain alone (GST-Vav-SH2) is greatly augmented following cellular activation. Neither control GST-Sepharose alone nor GST-Vav-SH3(COOH) (up to 100 µg/ml) precipitates phosphorylated pp76. Thus, interaction between the carboxyl-terminal tail of Vav and phosphorylated pp76 is dependent on Vav SH2-mediated binding. However, as can be seen in Fig. 3, the Vav SH2 plus SH3(COOH) domains bind tyrosine-phosphorylated pp76 more efficiently than equivalent amounts of the Vav SH2 domain alone. These data suggest that although the Vav SH2 domain is necessary and sufficient for association to occur, phosphorylated pp76 may bind cooperatively to the Vav SH2 and SH3 domains. Cooperative interactions between SH2 and SH3 domains have been described previously (49Prasad K.V.S. Kapeller R. Jannsen O. Repke H. Duke-Cohen J.S. Cantley L.C. Rudd C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7708-7717Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As a measure of specificity, precipitations were carried out using decreasing amounts of each fusion protein (range of 12.5 to 2.5 µg/sample). Although the intensity of each band decreased, the overall pattern of bands precipitated by each fusion protein remained unchanged (data not shown). Compared with native Vav, the GST-Vav fusion proteins precipitated a similar spectrum of tyrosine phosphoproteins but relatively larger amounts of the proteins at 65 and 70 kDa. Given an apparent molecular mass of 76 kDa and evidence of interaction with the Vav SH2 and probably SH3 domains, we examined whether pp76 was identical to SLP-76, a recently cloned 76-kDa molecule that binds Grb2 (43Jackman J.K. Motto D.G. Sun Q. Tanemoto M. Turck C.W. Peltz G.A. Koretzky G.A. Findell P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7029-7032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). SLP-76 undergoes activation-related tyrosine phosphorylation (50Motto D.G. Ross S. Jackman J.K. Sun Q. Olson A.L. Findell P. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21608-21613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Reif K. Buday L. Downward J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14081-14087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) following kinetics similar to those we observed for pp76 (Fig. 2). Furthermore, SLP-76 contains three tandem Tyr(P)-Glu-(Ser/Pro)-Pro sequences that resemble the predicted optimal sequence for binding by the Vav SH2 domain (Tyr(P)+1-Glu and Tyr(P)+3-Pro) (52Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGalde J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 (left panel), anti-SLP-76 precipitates a tyrosine-phosphorylated band that comigrates with the pp76 band precipitated by anti-Vav or GST-Vav-SH2+SH3(COOH). Anti-SLP-76 immunoblotting of a parallel membrane (Fig. 4, center panel) indicates that pp76 precipitated by both anti-Vav and GST-Vav-SH2+SH3(COOH) contains SLP-76. Furthermore, the amount of SLP-76 coprecipitated by Vav or GST-Vav increases after cellular activation. Whether SLP-76 binding to Vav or to this Vav fusion protein prior to cellular activation reflects a phosphotyrosine-dependent association mediated by low basal levels of SLP-76 phosphorylation versus phosphotyrosine-independent binding is not yet certain. Finally, anti-SLP also coprecipitates Vav in an activation-related fashion (Fig. 4, right panel). These results identify pp76 as SLP-76. Given the activation-related increase in SLP-76 association with Vav (Fig. 4) and the involvement of the Vav SH2 domain (Fig. 3), it was important to determine whether the CD45 isoform-dependent differential tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav and SLP-76 observed in our single isoform transfectants was associated with parallel differences in the physical interaction of these two molecules. As shown above, anti-CD3 stimulation results in relative hyperphosphorylation of Vav and Vav-associated SLP-76 in wild-type and CD45(ABC)-expressing transfectants compared with CD45- (J-AS-1) and transfectants expressing CD45(0) (Figs. 1A and 5A). Direct comparison with a parallel membrane immunoblotted with anti-SLP-76 clearly demonstrates that the differences in SLP-76 tyrosine phosphorylation observed in these cell lines reflect the differential association of SLP-76 with Vav (Fig. 5, compare A and B). When SLP-76 is directly immunoprecipitated from single isoform transfectants with anti-SLP, anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting reveals that total SLP-76, and not just that fraction associated with Vav, undergoes activation-induced CD45 isoform-specific tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 6). Consistent with the findings above, CD45(ABC) transfectants demonstrate relative hyperphosphorylation of SLP-76 and increased coprecipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav compared with cells expressing CD45(0). Taken altogether, our results demonstrate that the expression of distinct CD45 isoforms is associated with differential tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav and SLP-76 and differential recruitment of SLP-76 to Vav. Critical for TCR-mediated signaling, CD45 appears able to either increase or decrease the activity of Src family kinases such as Lck and Fyn by regulating the dephosphorylation of one or more tyrosine residues (18Mustelin T.

Although these studies demonstrate the requirement for the CD45 protein-tyrosine phosphatase domains in TCR-mediated signaling, they do not exclude a potentially important superimposed regulatory role for the physiological extracellular domains. This role has recently been documented by the direct comparison of cells that differ only in their CD45 isoform expression (30McKenney D.W. Onodera H. Gorman L. Mimura T. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol.

Immunity. 1994; 1: 109-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We now extend our previous observations and establish a novel link between CD45 isoform expression, Vav, and SLP-76. It is interesting to note that each of the three molecules identified in this pathway is expressed only in hematopoietic cells. CD45 isoform-specific pathways appear to involve only a subset of those proteins undergoing activation-induced tyrosine phosphorylation (30McKenney D.W. Onodera H. Gorman L. Mimura T. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24949-24954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Regardless, the overall functional significance of isoform-specific pathways is demonstrated by the significant differences in IL-2 secretion exhibited by cells expressing distinct CD45 isoforms both in our model (30McKenney D.W.

(53Novak T. Farber D.L. Leitenberg D. Hong S.-C. Johnson J. Bottomly K. Immunity. 1994; 1: 109-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that differential interactions between the various CD45 extracellular domains and unknown ligand(s) might direct the cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase domains toward distinct intracellular substrates (29Anderson P. Morimoto C. Breitmeyer J.B. Schlossman S.F. Immunol. Today. 1988; 9: 199-203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 54Leitenberg D. Novak T. Farber D.L. Smith B.R. Bottomly K. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The actual mechanism by which distinct CD45 isoforms differentially regulate Vav and SLP-76 phosphorylation is unknown. Although both molecules might be preferentially dephosphorylated by the CD45(0) isoform, this would not easily explain their decreased phosphorylation in CD45- cells or increased phosphorylation in wild-type cells (which express both CD45(0) and CD45(ABC)). A more consistent hypothesis is that SLP-76 and Vav are phosphorylated by one or more closely related protein-tyrosine kinases whose activity is differentially regulated by distinct CD45 isoforms. Our data further suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 augments its recruitment to Vav, through the Vav SH2 and SH3 domains. The phosphorylation of Vav does not appear to contribute to SLP-76 binding since fusion proteins containing the SLP-76 SH2 domain do not precipitate Vav (45Motto D.G. Ross S. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 138: 1937-1943Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and SLP-76 does not contain alternative phosphotyrosine recognition (PTB) domains. This is the first demonstration that the expression of distinct CD45 isoforms differentially regulates physical interactions between downstream signaling molecules. Which protein-tyrosine kinase(s) are responsible for the phosphorylation of these molecules in vivo is unknown. Vav can be phosphorylated by Lck in vitro, although IL-2-dependent phosphorylation of Vav occurs in Lck-deficient cells (34Gulbins E. Coggeshall K. Baier G. Katzav S. Burn P. Altman A. Science. 1993; 260: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 36Evans G.A. Howard O.M.Z. Erwin R. Farrar W.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). CD28 ligation results in a temporal association between Itk and Vav phosphorylation, suggesting a possible link in T cells (35August A. Gibson S. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Mills G. Dupont B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9347-9351Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This finding may be bolstered by a study showing that IL-3 induces the specific association of Tec kinase with Vav through its Tec homology domain in hematopoietic progenitor cells (55Machide M. Mano H. Todokoro K. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 619-625PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, it has been reported that ZAP-70 specifically associates with the Vav SH2 domain after T cell activation (40Katzav S. Sutherland M. Packham G. Yi T. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32579-32585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the consequences of TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association of SLP-76 and Vav are not yet known, they are likely to be of physiological importance. Using transient cotransfection assays, the overexpression of Vav and of SLP-76 have independently been shown to increase TCR-stimulated activity of IL-2 promoter reporter constructs (37Wu J. Katzav S. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 45Motto D.G. Ross S. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 138: 1937-1943Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar). More recent data show that simultaneous overexpression of SLP-76 and Vav results in synergistic augmentation of IL-2 promoter activity, suggesting possible functional interaction (56Wu J. Motto D. Koretzky G. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). However, the regulation of these signals may be complex. Our experiments indicate that Vav phosphorylation and SLP-76 phosphorylation are inversely related to IL-2 secretion in our single CD45 isoform transfectants (30McKenney D.W. Onodera H. Gorman L. Mimura T. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24949-24954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the tyrosine phosphorylation of particular sites might be inhibitory, perhaps through the induction of down-regulatory interactions. Alternatively, additional signaling defects that affect IL-2 secretion may be present in cells singly expressing the CD45(ABC) isoform. Clearly, identification of the effector molecules lying both up- and down- stream of Vav and SLP-76 will be required for a more detailed understanding of this important signaling pathway. The tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav may direct its association with other signaling molecules (39Ramos-Morales F. Drucker B. Fischer S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1917-1923PubMed Google Scholar), and we have now shown that the phosphorylation of SLP-76 up-regulates its association with Vav. Both Vav and SLP-76 constitutively associate with Grb2 through interactions requiring the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 (42Ye Z.-S. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12629-12633Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The ability of Grb2 to interact with Sos suggests a mechanism by which Vav might be linked to the Ras pathway. However, whether Sos binding in vivo requires only the amino-terminal SH3 domain or both SH3 domains of Grb2 is controversial (51Reif K. Buday L. Downward J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14081-14087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 57Shastry L. Lin W. Wong W.T. Paolo Di Fiori P. Scoppa C.A. King C.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9019-9023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is unclear whether or not a Vav·SLP-76·Grb2 complex would also contain Sos. Regardless, both SLP-76 and Grb2 contain SH2 domains capable of recruiting additional molecules into a complex containing Vav. For example, the SH2 domain of Grb2 has been shown to associate with Shc, a 116-kDa phosphoprotein recently identified as p120cbl, and an uncharacterized 36-kDa phosphoprotein (50Motto D.G. Ross S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SH2 domain of SLP-76 associates with proteins of 62 and 130 kDa (45Motto D.G. Ross S. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 138: 1937-1943Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It will now be crucial to determine which of these molecules can simultaneously associate into a signaling complex. These molecules will become prime candidates for differential regulation through this CD45 isoform-dependent pathway. Given the ability of individual T cells to alter their expression of CD45 isoforms during thymic development and after antigen exposure in the periphery, an understanding of the signaling pathways preferentially utilized by particular CD45 isoforms should ultimately provide important insight into the signals involved in maturation and development of functional repertoire. While this manuscript was under review, a similar interaction between Vav and SLP-76 was reported by Wu et al. (56Wu J. Motto D. Koretzky G. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar)."

In this study, we examined the ability of insulin to stimulate JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in insulin-sensitive tissues of the intact rat using immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. The results demonstrate that after an infusion of insulin, JAK2 is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated (and the kinase is activated) in the liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, heart, and isolated adipocytes. The presence of phosphorylated JAK2 was detectable after an infusion of insulin that increased serum insulin to physiological postprandial levels (40-70 microunits/ml). Co-immunoprecipitation with anti-insulin receptor antibody, anti-JAK2 antibody, and anti-IRS-1 antibody showed that JAK2 interacts with the insulin receptor and IRS-1 to form stable complexes following stimulation by insulin. In two animal models of insulin resistance the regulation of JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation after insulin infusion paralleled the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and of IRS-1. In conclusion, our data indicate that after physiological stimulation by insulin in the intact animal, JAK2 associates with the insulin receptor and is tyrosine phosphorylated in insulin-sensitive tissues in a time- and dose-dependent fashion.

INTRODUCTIONThe insulin receptor is the principal mediator of insulin action on cellular mitogenic and metabolic processes. The insulin receptor β-subunit, which contains an intrinsic tyrosine kinase, undergoes tyrosyl autophosphorylation and is activated in response to insulin binding to the extracellular α-subunit. Moreover the discovery of the insulin receptor's tyrosine kinase activity suggested that the mechanism of insulin action involved the tyrosyl phosphorylation of intracellular substrates. Using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies an insulin-stimulated phosphoprotein called pp185 was identified in many cells and tissues (1White M.F. Maron R. Kahn C.R.

The cloned protein was called insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). 1The abbreviations used are: IRSinsulin receptor substrateBSAbovine serum albuminJAKJanus kinase. More recently another constituent of the pp185 band termed IRS-2 was also purified, and its cDNA sequence was determined (9Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers Jr., M.G. Glassheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). There is also evidence showing that the protein Shc is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to insulin (10Pronk G.J. McGlade J. Pelicci G. Pawson T. Bos J.L. J. Biol.

However, the effect of insulin on JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation and its association with the insulin receptor have not yet been investigated. In this report, we have examined the ability of insulin to stimulate JAK2 phosphorylation in insulin-sensitive tissues of the intact rat after injection of the hormone. Our data indicate that following stimulation by insulin JAK2 associates with the insulin receptor and is tyrosine phosphorylated in the liver, heart, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle in a time- and dose-dependent fashion.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsReagents for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were from Bio-Rad. Aprotinin, ATP, dithiothreitol, HEPES, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, angiotensin II, Triton X-100, Tween 20, glycerol, and bovine serum albumin (BSA, fraction V) were from Sigma. Protein A-Sepharose 6MB was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., 125I-protein A was from ICN Biomedicals (Costa Mesa, CA), nitrocellulose paper (BA85, 0.2 mm) was from Schleicher & Schuell, and [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham Corp. Sodium amobarbital (Amytal) and human recombinant insulin (Humulin R) were from Eli Lilly. Anti-IRS-1 antibodies were raised in rabbits using a synthetic peptide (YIPGATMGTSTALTGDEAA) derived from the last 15 amino acids of the C terminus of rat IRS-1 as described previously (30Saad M.J. Folli F. Kahn J.A. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal and anti-JAK2 polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-insulin receptor antibody was raised in rabbits using a synthetic peptide derived from the amino acid sequence (KKNGRILTLPRSNPS) corresponding to the C terminus of the protein.MethodsAnimals and Tissue ExtractsMale rats (130-180 g) were allowed access to standard rodent chow and water ad libitum. Food was withdrawn 12-14 h before the experiments. The rats were anesthetized with sodium amobarbital (15 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally) and used 10-15 min later, as soon as anesthesia was assured by the loss of pedal and corneal reflexes. The abdominal cavity was opened, the portal vein exposed, and 0.5 ml of saline (0.9% NaCl) with or without 2 µg of insulin was injected. One minute later, the liver was removed, minced coarsely, and homogenized immediately in approximately 10 volumes of solubilization buffer A at 4°C with a Polytron PTA 20S generator (Brinkmann Instruments model PT 10/35) operated at maximum speed (setting 10) for 30 s. The solubilization buffer A was composed of 1% Triton X-100, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM sodium vanadate, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin. In some experiments other tissues such as adipose tissue and skeletal and heart muscle were also extracted. No more than two tissues were processed from the same animal. For the time course and dose-response experiments with adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and heart tissue, insulin was injected into the vena cava. The extracts were centrifuged at 55,000 rpm at 4°C in a Beckman 70.1 Ti rotor for 60 min to remove insoluble material, and the resulting supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation with anti-JAK2, anti-insulin receptor, and anti-IRS-1 antibodies. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose 6MB and were washed three times with 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mM sodium vanadate, and 0.1% Triton X-100.Cell IncubationsEpididymal and perirenal fat were harvested from 130-180-g rats. Adipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion as described previously (31Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Grichting G. Levy L.K. Goodman H.M. Endocrinology. 1983; 113: 1111-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and after being washed free of enzymes were suspended 1:3 (v/v) in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer containing 1% BSA and 5 mM glucose. Aliquots of the cell suspension (600 µl) were incubated with insulin (400 ng/ml) or saline in 1.5-ml plastic centrifuge tubes for 1 min. The incubation was terminated by centrifuging for 5 s and aspirating the incubation medium. Proteins were extracted by adding 600 µl of the extraction buffer as described above. The extracts were centrifuged and used for immunoprecipitation with anti-JAK2 antibody.Protein Analysis by ImmunoblottingAfter washing, the pellet was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) with 100 mM dithiothreitol and heated in a boiling water bath for 4 min. The samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6% Tris acrylamide) in a Bio-Rad miniature slab gel apparatus. Electrotransfer of proteins from the gel to nitrocellulose was performed for 2 h at 100 V (constant) in a Bio-Rad miniature transfer apparatus (Mini-Protean) as described by Towbin et al. (34Towbin H. Staehlin J. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44707) Google Scholar) but with 0.02% SDS added to the transfer buffer to enhance the elution of high molecular mass proteins. Nonspecific protein binding to the nitrocellulose was reduced by preincubating the filter overnight at 4°C in blocking buffer (3% BSA, 10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.02% Tween 20). The prestained molecular mass standards used were myosin (194 kDa), β-galactosidase (116 kDa), bovine serum albumin (85 kDa), and ovalbumin (49.5 kDa).The nitrocellulose blot was incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies or with the appropriate antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 4 h at 22°C and washed for 60 min with the blocking buffer without BSA. The blots were then incubated with 2 µCi of 125I-protein A (30 µCi/µg) in 10 ml of blocking buffer for 1 h at 22°C and washed again as described above for 2 h. 125I-Protein A bound to the anti-phosphotyrosine or other antibodies was detected by autoradiography using preflashed Kodak XAR film with Cronex Lightning Plus intensifying screens at -70°C for 12-48 h. Band intensities were quantitated by optical densitometry (Molecular Dynamics) of the developed autoradiogram.JAK2 in Vitro Kinase AssayImmunoprecipitated proteins bound to protein A-Sepharose were washed with kinase buffer (50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MnCl2, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) and subsequently incubated for 30 min at 24°C with kinase buffer containing 0.25 mCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP. After thorough washing with kinase buffer, the proteins were eluted by boiling with Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose as described above (19Wilks A.F.

Schieffer Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Insulin was infused into the portal vein to stimulate limited receptor activation and partial JAK2 autophosphorylation. JAK2 was then immunoprecipitated and allowed to autophosphorylate in vitro in the presence of exogenous ATP. Tyrosine phosphorylation was measured by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody.OtherProtein determination was performed by the Bradford dye method (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad reagent and BSA as the standard.Statistical AnalysisExperiments to investigate the regulation of JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in animal models of insulin resistance were always performed studying the physiological or pathological group of animals in parallel with a control group. Comparisons between fed and fasted (72 h), 2-month-old versus 20-month-old rats were made using paired and unpaired t test.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo investigate whether the protein JAK2 is phosphorylated following stimulation by insulin, we infused insulin into the portal vein of rats and then removed and homogenized the liver and immunoprecipitated the proteins with a polyclonal JAK2 antiserum. The JAK2 immunoprecipitates were analyzed for tyrosyl phosphorylation by immunoblotting with a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. JAK2 was rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following exposure of the liver to insulin (Fig. 1). The same response was observed when insulin was injected into the vena cava and the adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and heart tissue extracted (Fig. 1). As a control for JAK2 phosphorylation, we infused angiotensin II into the vena cava and then examined the level of tyrosine phosphorylation in the heart. The results show that after stimulation with angiotensin II there was a clear increase in cardiac JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1).To estimate the rate of insulin-induced JAK2 phosphorylation in the liver, we performed a time course experiment after administration of insulin into the portal vein. As shown in Fig. 2A, 1 min after exposure to insulin there was already a substantial increase in the phosphorylation of JAK2, the rate of which decreased after the first minute and had almost vanished after 1 h. A similar rapid phosphorylation was observed for the β-chain of the insulin receptor, which was used as a control for insulin receptor activation (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Time course and dose-response of insulin-stimulated JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in rat liver (panel A) and heart (panel B). Rats were anesthetized, and the abdominal wall was incised to expose viscera. Saline or insulin (at the time and dose indicated) were administered into portal vein or vena cava as a bolus injection. In the dose-response experiment, 1 and 3 min after insulin infusion the liver and the heart, respectively, were excised and homogenized in extraction buffer at 4°C, immunoprecipitated with anti-JAK2 or anti-insulin receptor antibodies, and immunoblotted as described in legend for Fig. 1. The data are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In the heart, the time course of insulin-induced JAK2 phosphorylation was similar to the liver, with a rapid increase at 1 min although the maximal increase was observed 3 min after insulin injection, followed by a decline over the 15 min of the experiment (Fig. 2B). The behavior of cardiac insulin receptor phosphorylation was also similar to the liver. The time courses of JAK2 phosphorylation in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue were similar to those of liver and heart (data not shown).The insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of JAK2, as determined by anti-JAK2 immunoprecipitates of liver extracts, was dose-dependent (Fig. 2A). The presence of phosphorylated JAK2 was detectable after the injection of as little as 20 ng of insulin, and half-maximal stimulation occurred with 200-400 ng of the hormone (Fig. 2A). Although we could not determine portal insulin levels, in preliminary experiments peripheral insulin levels obtained 90 s after an intraportal injection of 400 ng of insulin ranged between 40 and 70 microunits/ml and were similar to the normal physiological postprandial range in rats. Maximal stimulation was observed with 2 µg of insulin and was 7-12 times greater than the basal levels (n = 3).The dose-response relationships for the insulin stimulation of JAK2 phosphorylation from adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and heart were similar, when insulin was infused into the vena cava. Fig. 2B shows such a relationship for cardiac tissue and indicates that the maximal effect was observed at 2 µg of insulin and decreased thereafter.Because insulin may affect other mediators in vivo to induce these responses, we performed experiments in which the effects of insulin were analyzed in isolated adipocytes. The results are presented in Fig. 3A. A clear stimulation of JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation was induced by insulin, showing that insulin has a direct effect on this pathway.Fig. 3A, insulin induces JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in isolated adipocytes. Adipocytes isolated from normal rats were incubated in the absence or the presence of 400 ng/ml insulin for 1 min, and then the extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-JAK2 antibody and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. B, insulin activates JAK2 kinase activity in vitro in immunoprecipitates. Liver extracts (from rats infused with insulin or saline) were immunoprecipitated with anti-JAK2 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were used for in vitro kinase assays, and the products were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected by autoradiography. The blots were subsequently probed with anti-JAK2 antibody (data not shown). C, JAK2 tyrosine kinase activity measured by autophosphorylation. Insulin (20 ng) was injected into the portal vein to stimulate partial JAK2 autophosphorylation. JAK2 was then immunoprecipitated and allowed to autophosphorylate in vitro in the presence of exogenous ATP (lane 4). Tyrosine phosphorylation was measured by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Control conditions are shown in lanes 1-3. Lane 1, the liver extract was not exposed to insulin, nor was exogenous ATP added to the in vitro autophosphorylation reaction. Lane 2, the liver extract was not exposed to insulin, but ATP was added to the in vitro autophosphorylation reaction. Lane 3, insulin (20 ng) was infused into the portal vein, and the liver then extracted, but no exogenous ATP was added during the in vitro autophosphorylation step. The small signal seen in this lane probably represents JAK2 autophosphorylation using endogenous ATP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine whether JAK2 kinase activity was stimulated by insulin, we measured enzyme autophosphorylation in vitro using two approaches (Fig. 3, B and C). In the first approach, we immunoprecipitated liver extracts (with or without insulin treatment) with anti-JAK2 antibodies and performed an in vitro kinase assay using [γ-32P]ATP as described above. The results are presented in Fig. 3B and show that the JAK2 kinase activity was significantly increased in liver extracts after a portal infusion of insulin. In the second approach, a low dose of insulin (20 ng) was infused into the portal vein to obtain limited tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, which was then immunoprecipitated and reacted with ATP to permit autophosphorylation. The phosphorylation of tyrosine was quantified by Western blot analysis using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, which showed that insulin induces JAK2 autophosphorylation (Fig. 3C, lane 4). The small signal seen in the liver extract previously infused with a low dose of insulin but with no exogenous ATP added during the in vitro autophosphorylation step (Fig. 3C, lane 3) probably represents JAK2 autophosphorylation using endogenous ATP.The rapid induction of JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation by insulin suggests that JAK2 may associate with the insulin receptor. To test this possibility, liver extracts were immunoprecipitated with the anti-JAK2 antibody before and after insulin stimulation, and the precipitated proteins were probed with anti-receptor antibody. The experiments show that JAK2 co-precipitates with insulin receptor. Although small amounts of insulin receptor were bound to JAK2 before insulin stimulation, the addition of the hormone increased the insulin receptor-JAK2 association within 1 min. Anti-insulin receptor co-immunoprecipitation was also performed with the same tissue extracts. As shown in Fig. 4, JAK2 protein was co-immunoprecipitated by anti-insulin receptor antibody, with much higher affinity following insulin stimulation. These results were also reproduced in rat skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and cardiac tissue and demonstrate that JAK2 physically associates with the insulin receptor clearly upon insulin stimulation.Fig. 4The association of JAK2 with the insulin receptor and IRS-1 in rat liver. The animals were anesthetized, and the abdominal wall was incised to expose the viscera. Saline or 2 µg of insulin (as depicted in the figure) were infused into portal vein as a bolus injection, and 1 min later the tissues were excised and homogenized in extraction buffer at 4°C as described in under “Experimental Procedures.” After centrifugation, aliquots containing equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-JAK2, anti-insulin receptor, or anti-IRS-1 antibodies as indicated in the figure. The immunoprecipitates were separated on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then immunoblotted (Blot) sequentially with anti-insulin receptor, anti-JAK2, and anti-IRS-1 antibodies as indicated in the figure. The data are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Co-immunoprecipitation between JAK2 and IRS-1 in liver was also observed. In immunoprecipitates of IRS-1 that were blotted with anti-JAK2 antibody, a band corresponding to JAK2 was evident after insulin stimulation (Fig. 4). When the liver extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-JAK2 antibody and blotted with anti-IRS-1 antibody, a band corresponding to IRS-1 was detected in basal state, and after insulin stimulation there was an increase in this band (Fig. 4, lower panel). As a control we performed also immunoprecipitation of liver extracts with anti-insulin receptor and anti-IRS-1 antibody, and blotted with anti-IRS-1 antibody. There was a band corresponding to IRS-1 in anti-insulin receptor immunoprecipitates in the basal state and an increase in this band after insulin stimulation. These results clearly demonstrated that JAK2 interacts with insulin receptor and IRS-1 and forms stable complexes following insulin stimulation.Over the past several years, considerable progress has been made in elucidating the signaling pathways downstream from tyrosine phosphorylation. It is becoming increasingly clear that these pathways are complex and contain many branches that often diverge from a common point. One tyrosine kinase may phosphorylate many proteins. For example, in addition to autophosphorylation, the insulin receptor phosphorylates IRS-1 (3Rothenberg P.L. Lane W.S. Karasik A. Backer J. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol.

Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Moreover, converging branches and intracellular cross-talk between different signaling pathways have been demonstrated. Thus, there are two pathways from the insulin receptor that lead to the activation of GRB-2/m-SOS; one involves the phosphorylation of IRS-1, whereas the other involves the phosphorylation of Shc (13Skolnik E.Y. Lee C.H. Batzer A. Vicentini L.M. Zhou M. Daly R. Myers Jr., M.J. Backer J.M. Ulrich A. White M.F. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1926-1936Crossref Scopus (604) Google Scholar). It is interesting that hormones that do not contain an intrinsic tyrosine kinase, as well as cytokines, are able to phosphorylate IRS-1. This further suggests the presence of converging branches with different ligands and receptors. Because JAK2 is an obvious candidate for the tyrosine kinase responsible for growth hormone- and some cytokines-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 (36Argetsinger L.S. Hsu G.W. Myers M.G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14685-14692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), it is interesting that JAK2 forms a stable complex with the insulin receptor and IRS-1 after stimulation with insulin. Whether JAK2 is able to phosphorylate IRS-1 in response to insulin remains to be determined.Because JAK2 binds the insulin receptor and is phosphorylated after exposure to insulin, it is also a candidate for a role in the regulation of physiological and pathophysiological states of insulin resistance. Previous studies have shown that the insulin receptor is up-regulated in insulin-sensitive tissues after a period of fasting (37Flier J.S. Annu. Rev. Med. 1983; 34: 145-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 38Friedenberg G. Klein H.H. Cordera R. Olefsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12444-12453PubMed Google Scholar) and that this correlates with an increase in insulin receptor and IRS-1 phosphorylation (39Saad M.J.A. Araki E. Miralpeix M. Rothenberg P.L. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1839-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the effect of fasting on JAK2 phosphorylation in insulin-sensitive tissues, we injected insulin into the portal vein of fed and fasted rats, extracted the liver, and performed immunoprecipitation with anti-insulin receptor, anti-IRS-1, and anti JAK2 antibodies, followed by immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibody. The results of these experiments showed a remarkable increase in insulin receptor and IRS-1 phosphorylation during fasting, thus confirming previous studies, and also indicated that after insulin stimulation, JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation increased more dramatically in the liver of rats fasted for 72 h (Fig. 5A).Fig. 5Insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, JAK2, and insulin receptor in the liver of fed and fasted rats (panel A) and in the heart of 2-month-old and 20-month-old rats (panel B). A, liver samples from fed or 72 h fasted rats were extracted and homogenized as described in the legend for Fig. 1, after an intraportal injection of saline or 2 µg of insulin (as depicted in the figure). Aliquots containing equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-IRS-1 anti-JAK2 or anti-insulin receptor antibody and protein A-Sepharose 6MB and then resolved on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels.

Brenelli S.L. Silva A.C. Nunes A.L.B. Velloso L.A. Saad M.J.A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated the effect of aging on the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 in the heart in response to insulin administered via the vena cava. The hearts were excised and homogenized, and the extracts used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting as described previously. The results demonstrated that JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin paralleled that of insulin receptor and IRS-1 phosphorylation, because there was also a decrease in JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in the heart of old rats compared with 2-month-old rats (Fig. 5B).In various cells and tissues, JAK activation has been proposed to be the signaling pathway that mediates the transcriptional activation of early growth response genes by cell surface cytokines (41Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). The JAK2 pathway may play a similar role in the control of insulin-induced cell growth. The shared use of JAK2 by multiple receptors is likely to reveal important connections between various hormones and cytokines that were previously unrecognized or that had been observed but remained unexplained. INTRODUCTIONThe insulin receptor is the principal mediator of insulin action on cellular mitogenic and metabolic processes. The insulin receptor β-subunit, which contains an intrinsic tyrosine kinase, undergoes tyrosyl autophosphorylation and is activated in response to insulin binding to the extracellular α-subunit. Moreover the discovery of the insulin receptor's tyrosine kinase activity suggested that the mechanism of insulin action involved the tyrosyl phosphorylation of intracellular substrates. Using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies an insulin-stimulated phosphoprotein called pp185 was identified in many cells and tissues (1White M.F. Maron R. Kahn C.R.

The cloned protein was called insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). 1The abbreviations used are: IRSinsulin receptor substrateBSAbovine serum albuminJAKJanus kinase. More recently another constituent of the pp185 band termed IRS-2 was also purified, and its cDNA sequence was determined (9Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers Jr., M.G. Glassheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). There is also evidence showing that the protein Shc is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to insulin (10Pronk G.J. McGlade J. Pelicci G. Pawson T. Bos J.L. J. Biol.

However, the effect of insulin on JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation and its association with the insulin receptor have not yet been investigated. In this report, we have examined the ability of insulin to stimulate JAK2 phosphorylation in insulin-sensitive tissues of the intact rat after injection of the hormone. Our data indicate that following stimulation by insulin JAK2 associates with the insulin receptor and is tyrosine phosphorylated in the liver, heart, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle in a time- and dose-dependent fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2012668445,"Expression of the albumin gene in the liver is controlled by several liver-enriched transcription factors. However, the mechanisms which contribute to its regulation during pathophysiological states, such as liver regeneration, are still little understood. In the present study we found that during liver regeneration down-regulation of albumin mRNA expression is transcriptionally controlled through a minimal element (nucleotide -170 to +22) of the albumin promoter and is observed mainly during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, while high levels of albumin expression are preserved at later time points. Decreased albumin mRNA levels correlate with a dramatic increase in nuclear expression of C/EBP-β/LAP, a protein known to bind to the D site of the albumin promoter and also to be involved in cell cycle control. In contrast, nuclear expression of other factors such as HNF-1 or C/EBP-α, which also have been shown to transcriptionally control albumin expression, is either unchanged or slightly decreased. We show that pre- and post-translational mechanisms are involved in the higher nuclear expression of C/EBP-β/LAP as early as 1 h after hepatectomy, which also leads to its increased binding toward the D site of the albumin promoter. Finally, in vitro transcription assays with liver nuclear extracts and recombinant C/EBP-β/LAP demonstrate that C/EBP-β/LAP can directly down-regulate transcription mediated by the minimal element of the albumin promoter. Additionally the inhibitory role of C/EBP-β/LAP on the albumin minimal promoter could be confirmed by transfection experiments in hepatoma cells. These results indicate that C/EBP-β/LAP, while enhancing transcription of cell cycle-related genes and controlling G1/S phase checkpoint, down-regulates a major liver function, i.e. albumin synthesis, to prepare the hepatocyte for entry into the cell cycle.

Differentiated hepatocytes are important for the maintenance of several vital functions. They regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and detoxification of exogenous and endogenous compounds, and they produce most of the plasma proteins, such as albumin, while resting in the G0 phase of the cell cycle. Albumin is a typical liver-specific gene which is important for the transportation of particles through the body and the preservation of serum colloid osmotic pressure in the blood. The albumin gene is highly expressed in the liver after birth, and its regulation has been shown to be transcriptionally controlled (1Tilgham S.M. Belayew A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1982; 79: 5254-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 2Panduro A. Shalaby F. Shafritz D.A. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 1172-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Several cis-acting elements in the albumin promoter exist (sites A-F). The B and D sites have been shown to be especially important as liver-specific transcription factors bind to these elements (3Maire P. Wuarin J. Schibler U. Science. 1989; 244: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). HNF-1 binds to the B site (4Courtois G. Baumhueter S. Crabtree G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7937-7941Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 5Lichtsteiner S. Schibler U. Cell. 1989; 57: 1179-1187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Members of the C/EBP family which belong to the leucine zipper proteins of transcription factors interact at the D site of the albumin promoter (6Landschutz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2547) Google Scholar, 7Mueller C.R. Maire P. Schibler U.

Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Several events can influence the expression of the albumin gene. Under physiological conditions, the extracellular oncotic pressure controls albumin gene expression via HNF-1 (9Pietrangelo A. Panduro A. Roy-Chowdhury J. Shafritz D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1755-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 10Pietrangelo A. Shafritz D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). During pathologic states, such as the acute phase response of the liver, albumin gene expression is down-regulated (11Trautwein C. Büker K. Manns M.P. Gut. 1994; 35: 1163-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In recent years several transcription factors have been cloned which are involved in the regulation of the acute phase genes. Stat 3, also known as APRF (acute phase response factor), has been shown to belong to the family of signal transducer and activators of transcription (12Akira S. Nishio Y. Inoue M. Wang X.-J. Wei S. Matsusaka T. Yoshida K. Sudo T. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1994; 77: 63-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 13Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). A second transcription factor involved in the regulation of the acute phase response has been cloned by several groups and named C/EBP-β, IL6-DBP, NF-IL6, LAP, or CRP2 (8Descombes P. Chojkier M. Lichtensteiner S. Falvey E. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 14Akira S. Isshiki H. Takahisa S. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T.

Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). It is a member of the C/EBP family and binds like the other members to the D site of the albumin promoter. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms are important for the activity of LAP/NF-IL6 during the acute phase response (15Poli V. Mancini F.P. Cortese R. Cell. 1990; 63: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a specific role for C/EBP-β/LAP in cell cycle control has been proposed recently (19Buck M. Turler H. Chojkier M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 20Barone M.V. Crozat A. Tabaee A. Philipson L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Liver regeneration occurs after partial destruction or removal of parenchymal liver tissue. DNA synthesis in the parenchymal cells starts 12-16 h after a two-thirds hepatectomy and reaches a peak at around 24 h after surgery (21Grisham J.W. Cancer Res. 1962; 22: 842-849PubMed Google Scholar). Different factors are involved in regulating the transition from resting to dividing cells. However, the actual mechanisms mediating this process remain poorly understood (22Michalopoulos G.K. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). During liver regeneration, activation of several growth regulatory loops between hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells occurs. While HGF has been shown to stimulate hepatocyte entry into the cell cycle, transforming growth factor-β seems to be involved in regulating the transition period from the proliferate state back to G0 (22Michalopoulos G.K. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 23Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Maina F. Zonca P. Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G. Comoglio P.M.

Reduction of functional liver mass has profound effects on the liver which has to discriminate between functions of immediate significance for survival and resources necessary for liver mass restoration. Thus mechanisms on the molecular level and the regulation of liver-specific transcription factors which are important in mediating the transcriptional control of the albumin gene, the major liver product, may be influenced by these events. We show that down-regulation of albumin mRNA during liver regeneration is transcriptionally controlled and correlates with changes in nuclear expression and binding of C/EBP-β/LAP to the D site of the albumin promoter, a protein known to control cell cycle progression. As these regulatory mechanisms occur before entry into S phase, they could have an implication in G0-G1 phase transition by saving resources for progression of hepatocytes through the cell cycle. 6-9-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from the animal facility of the Medizinische Hochschule Hannover. The animals were maintained on a 12-h night and 12-h hour light schedule. 12 h before surgery, food was withdrawn from the animals. Surgery was performed between 8 and 10 a.m. Anesthesia of animals was performed by an intraperitoneal injection of a combination of Rompun/ketamine. After a small subxyphoid incision, a two-thirds hepatectomy was performed essentially as described by Higgins et al. (25Higgins G.M. Anderson R.M. Arch Pathol. 1931; 12: 186-202Google Scholar). Following surgery the abdominal cavum was closed by a suture. Sham surgery was performed exactly as indicated with the animals where resection of two-thirds of the liver was performed, except that the liver was only manipulated and not resected. For each time point indicated, routinely four rats were used in parallel. The remaining livers were removed, pooled, and rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and part of the livers were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. From the rest of the liver, nuclei were prepared essentially as described by Descombes et al. (8Descombes P. Chojkier M. Lichtensteiner S. Falvey E. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). All the steps were performed at 4°C. Nuclear extracts were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, FRG) in 1% SDS, 20% methanol, 400 mM glycine, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, at 4°C for 2 h at 200 mA. C/EBP-α was detected with an antibody purchased from Santa Cruz chemicals, the antibody generated against C/EBP-β was a generous gift from E. Ziff, the antibody against C/EBP-δ from G. Darlinghton, the antibody against cyclin A from G. Draetta, and the antibody against HNF-1 from R. Cortese. The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using the ECL detection system as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Corp., FRG). Recombinant protein was obtained using the pet-vector system for C/EBP-β/LAP as described earlier (27Trautwein C. van der Geer P. Karin M. Hunter T. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2554-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The plasmid was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL 21/DE-3/pLys S, and the protein was induced and purified (27Trautwein C. van der Geer P. Karin M. Hunter T. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2554-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For the gel retardation assays nuclear extracts or recombinant proteins were used as indicated. The binding reaction was performed for 20 min on ice. For binding assays an oligonucleotide spanning the D site of the albumin promoter was used as a 32P-labeled probe. Free DNA and DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel as described previously (27Trautwein C. van der Geer P. Karin M. Hunter T. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2554-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For better resolution, some of the gels were run for 4 h at 300 V. “Supershift” experiments were performed with an antibody against C/EBP-α, β/LAP, and C/EBP-δ. In Vitro Transcription Assays—In vitro transcription assays were performed as described by Gorski et al. (28Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). As DNA template we used the G-less cassette containing constructs Alb 400 and AdML 200 G-free which were a generous gift from U. Schibler. Nuclear extracts, template DNA, and recombinant proteins were preincubated on ice for 15 min in a total volume of 17 µl. Addition was made of 3 µl to the reaction mix containing 20 × NTP, RNasin, and 10 µCi of [32P]UTP were added. The transcription was performed for 45 min at 30°C. The reaction was terminated by adding the stop buffer (250 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH = 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 1% SDS), 2 µl of 10 mg/ml tRNA, and 4 µl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K solution, and incubation was for 30 min at 37°C. After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the RNAs were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide/urea gel. Northern Blot Analysis Northern blot analysis was performed as described before, according to standard procedures. Total RNA was isolated by the guanidium isothiocyanate method (29Trautwein C. Ramadori G. Gerken G. Meyer Büschenfelde K.-H. Manns M.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). 15 µg of total RNA were analyzed through a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel, followed by transfer to Hybond N membranes (Amersham). The C/EBP-α, C/EBP-β/LAP, C/EBP-δ, and GAPDH cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]ATP according to random priming (Boehringer Mannheim, FRG). The hybridization procedure was performed as described elsewhere (29Trautwein C. Ramadori G. Gerken G. Meyer Büschenfelde K.-H. Manns M.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For the generation of 35S-labeled RNA probes the plasmid pBS-LAP Δ21 (30Trautwein C. Walker D. Plümpe J. Manns M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15130-15136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was digested with NcoI, and the sequences between the second and the third ATG of the LAP open reading frame were subcloned into pBS (LAP 22-152). To generate run-off transcripts of the “antisense” and “sense” strands, respectively, 1 µg of plasmids linearized with either HindIII or EcoRI restriction endonucleases and 10 units of T7 or T3 RNA polymerases were added to a 10-µl reaction mixture containing 100 µCi of 35S-uridine 5′-α-thiotriphosphate (1250 Ci/mmol, Amersham, FRG), 1 mmol/L each adenosine, cytidine, and guanosine 5′-triphosphate, 10 mmol/L dithiothreitol, 25 units of human placental RNase inhibitor, 6 mmol/L MgCl2, 40 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mmol/L spermidine, 10 mmol/L NaCl, and incubated 1 h at 37°C, as described previously (31Pietrangelo A. Gualdi R. Casalgrandi G. Montosi G. Ventura E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1824-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization analysis was performed on tissue frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Five-µm thick frozen tissue samples were collected onto 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-coated slides, air-dried, and fixed in 4% solution of paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 5 mmol/L MgCl2 for 15 min. Prehybridization, hybridization, and washings of slides were performed as described previously (32Pietrangelo A. Gualdi R. Casalgrandi G. Geerts A. De Bleser P. Montosi G. Ventura E. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Slides were first exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR films (Eastman Kodak Co.) at room temperature for 2-4 days, and then coated with Kodak NTB-2 emulsion and exposed at 4°C for several weeks, typically 4-6 weeks. After development in Kodak D19 developer and fixation in Kodak Fixer, the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin-eosin, mounted, and viewed under a light microscope in the dark or by bright field. HepG2 cells (ATCC) were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. DNA transfection into HepG2 cells was carried out as described previously (30Trautwein C. Walker D. Plümpe J. Manns M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15130-15136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The reporter construct used in these experiments represents the minimal albumin promoter linked to a CAT 1The abbreviations used are: CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseAdMLadenovirus major late. reporter gene (ALB-CAT) (9Pietrangelo A. Panduro A. Roy-Chowdhury J. Shafritz D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1755-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). CAT assays were performed 48 h after transfection using thin layer chromatography for the separation of the reaction products. Quantification of the CAT results was carried out with a Fuji imager (30Trautwein C. Walker D. Plümpe J. Manns M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15130-15136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Activation of the reporter construct is shown as fold activation compared to the condition when 2 µg of the ALB-CAT were transfected in HepG2 cells alone. chloramphenicol acetyltransferase adenovirus major late. Quantification of results was performed with a Fuji imager or by a densitometer as described previously (29Trautwein C. Ramadori G. Gerken G. Meyer Büschenfelde K.-H. Manns M.P. Biochem. Biophys.

Following a two-thirds hepatectomy, the remaining liver cells enter the cell cycle, and after 7-14 days the original liver weight is reconstituted (33Fausto N. Zakim D. Boyer T.D. Hepatology: A Textbook of Liver Disease. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1990: 49Google Scholar). Albumin mRNA expression was studied at different time points after hepatectomy and sham surgery by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, a dramatic drop in albumin mRNA expression was detected starting 4 h after hepatectomy. Pretreatment levels were found again after 24 h. In contrast, only a very transient down-regulation was found in control animals following sham surgery (Fig. 1B). Albumin mRNA expression can be regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level (3Maire P. Wuarin J. Schibler U. Science. 1989; 244: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 34Dompenciel R.E. Garnepudi V.R. Schoenberg D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6108-6118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, to study that transcriptional mechanisms may at least be in part involved in the down-regulation of albumin mRNA expression during liver regeneration, “in vitro transcription” analysis was performed. Nuclear extracts were tested before surgery and 6 h after hepatectomy. For albumin-specific transcription, a construct was used containing the albumin promoter combined with a G-less cassette which leads to a 400-bp transcription product (28Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). As an internal control the adenovirus major late (AdML) promoter was added to all the experiments. Fig. 1C shows that 6 h after hepatectomy transcription of the albumin promoter is down-regulated while transcription of the AdML promoter is unaffected. These results demonstrated that transcriptional events are crucial for the down-regulation of albumin mRNA expression during liver regeneration, as was also suggested by previous studies (35Panduro A. Shalaby F. Weiner F.R. Biempica L. Zern M.A. Shafritz D.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, for the first time these results show that the change in albumin mRNA expression after hepatectomy is mediated by a minimal promoter region of the albumin gene located between nucleotide -170 to +22. Further experiments were performed to determine the time period of albumin down-regulation during cell cycle progression post-hepatectomy. Cyclin A is highly expressed in the nucleus during S phase, because the protein is required for G1/S phase transition and control of S phase (36Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed at different time points after hepatectomy with an anti-cyclin A antibody. High nuclear expression of cyclin A started 24 h after hepatectomy, while nuclear cyclin A expression remained low after sham surgery (Fig. 2B). High nuclear expression of cyclin A was also evident in replicating splenocytes (Fig. 2, A and B). After the results of the in vitro transcription analysis, which suggested that factors binding to the albumin promoter may control down-regulation of the gene post-hepatectomy, expression of the known transcription factors which bind to the albumin promoter were studied. HNF-1 binds to the B site and leucine zipper proteins of the C/EBP family namely C/EBP-α and C/EBP-β/LAP bind to the D site (5Lichtsteiner S. Schibler U. Cell. 1989; 57: 1179-1187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 8Descombes P. Chojkier M. Lichtensteiner S. Falvey E. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Time-dependent expression of HNF-1α and C/EBP family members was studied by Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts. HNF-1α is strongly expressed before and during liver regeneration. In fact no difference in its nuclear expression could be detected after two-thirds hepatectomy or sham surgery (Fig. 3, A and B). C/EBP-α shows moderate down-regulation starting as early as 2 h after hepatectomy, while the 30 kDa C/EBP-α inhibitory protein was up-regulated. Normal C/EBP-α levels are reconstituted 12-24 h post-hepatectomy (Fig. 4A). In contrast, a more dramatic regulation was found for C/EBP-β/LAP. A more than 10-fold increase was apparent 4-6 h after hepatectomy (Fig. 4C). Additionally, a slower migrating band appeared at these time points and the band was especially prominent after 6 h. Comparison with other time points demonstrated that the ratio changes toward the slower migrating band. Pretreatment levels were found 24 h after hepatectomy. Loading of the gels was checked by Coomassie Blue staining which was performed in parallel to the Western blot analysis (data not shown). In contrast to hepatectomy, control rats showed no change in C/EBP-α expression and only a mild increase in C/EBP-β/LAP expression 2 h after surgery (Fig. 4, B and D).Fig. 4Nuclear expression of C/EBP-α and C/EBP-β/LAP, major binding proteins to the D site of the albumin promoter. A-D, Nuclear extracts at different time points following hepatectomy (A and C) and sham surgery (B and D) were separated with a SDS-gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose. Spleen nuclear extracts (SN) were used as a control. C/EBP-α and C/EBP-β/LAP were analyzed by anti-C/EBP-α (A and B) and anti-C/EBP-β/LAP. The positions of C/EBP-α and C/EBP-β/LAP are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Additionally, C/EBP-δ was studied by Western blot analysis. Neither before nor after surgery were specific signals detected using an anti-C/EBP-δ antibody (data not shown), indicating that C/EBP-δ was not induced in the liver following hepatectomy or sham surgery. Therefore, results of Western blot analysis suggest that decreased albumin transcription found during liver regeneration correlates best with changes in the nuclear expression of C/EBP-β/LAP. Earlier results showed that post-transcriptional mechanisms modulate the activity of C/EBP-β/LAP by intracellular pathways (37Wegner M. Cao Z. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1992; 256: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 38Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 39Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa T. Sasaki K. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known about how C/EBP mRNA accumulation is regulated in the liver. Thus C/EBP-α and C/EBP-β/LAP mRNA expression was studied by Northern blot analysis. In parallel to the protein level, the signal for C/EBP-α slightly decreased following hepatectomy. After 2 h, 25% of the pretreatment level was found by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 5A). The time kinetics between C/EBP-α mRNA and protein expression indicates that they are directly linked to each other. Only moderate regulation was observed in control animals (Fig. 5B). A constant increase of C/EBP-β/LAP mRNA was noticed starting immediately after hepatectomy and peak expression was found 6 h after surgery (Fig. 5A). At later time points, mRNA levels dropped dramatically and returned to pretreatment values after 9 h. In control animals peak expression of C/EBP-β/LAP mRNA was evident as early as 1 h after sham surgery, and C/EBP-β/LAP mRNA constantly decreased thereafter, showing the opposite kinetics compared to the animals after hepatectomy (Fig. 5, A and B). Therefore we wondered whether the different kinetics in C/EBP-β/LAP mRNA expression between hepatectomy and sham surgery could be explained due to differences in its lobular distribution pattern. In situ hybridization studies with specific cRNA probes were performed to detect mRNA transcripts of C/EBP-β/LAP mRNA in different parts of the liver lobule. Fig. 6 shows that following hepatectomy a homogeneous distribution of hybridization signal for C/EBP-β/LAP mRNA can be found in hepatocytes throughout the liver lobule. Yet at 6 h after surgery the signal is dramatically enhanced as compared to that found for sham surgery, thus confirming the results of Northern blot analysis. Therefore in these animals, stimuli appear to activate C/EBP-β/LAP expression in hepatocytes regardless of their lobular position. No specific signal over background level for C/EBP-β/LAP was detected when the experiments were performed with the sense probe (Fig. 6D). Moreover, Fig. 6F shows that high amounts of C/EBP-β/LAP transcripts are specifically found in liver parenchymal cells. We showed that differences in the nuclear expression of C/EBP-α and C/EBP-β do occur during liver regeneration, therefore we analyzed whether these changes affect DNA binding. Gel shift experiments were performed using the D site of the albumin promoter as a labeled probe. In order to detect minor differences in DNA binding, increasing amounts of nuclear extracts (obtained before surgery) were added to the incubation mix. All further experiments were performed with concentrations of nuclear extracts, where approximately 10% of the labeled probe is bound to proteins (see lane 4 in Fig. 7A). The amount was equivalent to 1 µg of nuclear extract. C/EBP family members were identified by “supershift” experiments. Antibodies for C/EBP-α, C/EBP-β, and C/EBP-δ were added to the incubation mix. As shown in Fig. 7, B and C, specific bands corresponding to C/EBP-α and C/EBP-β/LAP were recognized and “supershifted.” Other bands showed a light decrease in intensity which might be explained by heterodimer formation between C/EBP family members. Supershift experiments performed with antibodies for C/EBP-δ (Fig. 7B) indicated that C/EBP-δ is not present in nuclear extracts of Sprague-Dawley rats, thus confirming the results obtained by Western blot analysis. Fig. 8A shows the time-dependent binding of nuclear extracts to the D site of the albumin promoter following hepatectomy. Increased binding of C/EBP-β/LAP starts as early as 0.5 h after surgery, and the strongest affinity toward the cognate DNA was found 4-6 h after hepatectomy. In contrast to the C/EBP-β/LAP band before surgery (la"

Neurosci. 1994; 17: 489-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar and 2Cordell B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 69-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanistic details that lead to the generation of this peptide are of interest. It is known that the β-amyloid peptide is produced in the course of normal cellular metabolism of the β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) 1The abbreviations used are: β-APPβ-amyloid precursor proteinNSEneuron-specific enolaseEGFepidermal growth factorTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.

Also, increased levels of this peptide appear to be produced when excess and/or aberrant forms of β-APP are expressed such as observed for a number of human situations linked to Alzheimer's disease, including naturally occurring mutations in β-APP (7Mullan M.

We have previously demonstrated that the production of β-amyloid results from the catabolic degradation of β-APP (16Higaki J. Quon D. Zhong Z. Cordell B. Neuron. 1995; 14: 651-659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and that increased levels of this peptide are generated by the intracellular disposal of excess normal β-APP or of abnormal β-APP by the secretory pathway (13Zhong Z. Quon D. Higgins L. Higaki J. Cordell B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, multiple intracellular pathways have been identified that are capable of processing β-APP to β-amyloid, each of which appears linked to the secretory pathway but at different subcellular compartments involving the early endosome and the trans-Golgi (17Martin B.L. Schrader-Fischer G. Busciglio J. Duke M. Paganetti P. Yankner B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26727-26730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Haass C. Lemere C.A. Capell A. Citron M. Seubert P. Schenk D. Lannfelt L. Selkoe D.J. Nature Med. 1995; 1: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar).In addition to efforts focused on the identification of the intracellular sites that give rise to the β-amyloid peptide, considerable attention has been directed to defining the proteolytic processing events of β-APP that lead to β-amyloid formation or preclude it. In general, there are three key β-APP processing steps mediated by enzymes referred to as α-, β-, and γ-secretase. α-Secretase appears to result from a collection of enzymatic activities that cleave within the β-amyloid domain of β-APP permitting the bulk of the precursor to be secreted (19Sisodia S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6075-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 20Zhong Z. Higaki J. Murakami K. Wang Y. Catalano R. Quon D. Cordell B. J. Biol.

Cleavage of β-APP by an α-secretase precludes ~4-kDa β-amyloid formation and ultimately yields a ~3-kDa peptide bearing the carboxyl terminus of β-amyloid.The combination of β- and γ-secretase processing of β-APP generates the amino and carboxyl termini of the ~4-kDa β-amyloid peptide, respectively. A recent report has detailed the sequence requirements for β-secretase (24Citron M. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This study indicates that β-secretase cleavage seems to be a consequence of the activity of multiple proteinases, together giving rise to a heterogeneous set of amino termini. Several major preferred β-secretase cleavage sites were shown to correspond to the three most common amino termini of the β-amyloid peptide (5Busciglio J. Gabuzda D.H. Matsudara P. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2092-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 23Haass C. Selkoe D.J.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This situation is similar to α-secretase processing, which also appears to be mediated by multiple proteinases acting at a few highly preferred cleavage sites (20Zhong Z. Higaki J. Murakami K. Wang Y. Catalano R. Quon D. Cordell B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 627-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Maruyama K. Kametani F. Usami M. Yamao-Harigaya W. Tanaka K. Biochem. Biophys.

In contrast, information on the details of γ-secretase processing has not been as extensive. Previously, we described several features of γ-secretase action, specifically that this step in β-amyloid formation occurs as a consequence of β-APP catabolism, that cleavage takes place in the early endosome, not the lysosome, and that γ-secretase activity can be blocked by a unique chemical inhibitor directed to, but not exclusive for, thiol proteinases (16Higaki J. Quon D. Zhong Z. Cordell B. Neuron. 1995; 14: 651-659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In this study, we extend our analysis of γ-secretase processing of β-APP to examine the amino acid sequence specificity directing this cleavage. Because the sites that ultimately form the carboxyl termini of the β-amyloid peptide are contained within the β-APP transmembrane domain, our experiments also identified the position of the membrane boundary vis à vis these cleavage sites.RESULTSProcessing of β-APP by γ-secretase produces the carboxyl terminus of the ~4-kDa β-amyloid peptide. Heterogeneity of this terminus has been observed for β-amyloid produced in vitro (25Asami-Odaka A. Ishibashi Y. Kikuchi T. Kitada C. Suzuki N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10272-10278Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and in vivo (26Roher A.E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Woods S. Cotter R.J. Gowing E. Ball M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1965-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), with position 40 of the β-amyloid domain being the most common terminus and positions 38, 39, 41, 42, and 43 less frequently represented by wild-type β-APP. We examined processing at this site with a variety of amino acid substitutions. Conservative and highly divergent substitutions were made and analyzed for β-amyloid production using immunoprecipitation. Transient expression of wild-type β-APP or β-APP harboring each mutation was carried out in COS-7 cells. An antiserum, number 6514, that is directed to an epitope at the amino terminus of the ~4-kDa peptide was employed so that protein sequence alterations would not perturb detection of the peptide.Hydrophobic substitutions at position 40 did not preclude β-amyloid production. Fig. 1B and Table I illustrate one example of such a substitution, phenylalanine, in which levels of β-amyloid were found to be nearly equivalent to that generated by transfection of wild-type β-APP DNA. In addition, β-APP production and maturation and carboxyl-terminal fragment production resulting from α- and γ-secretases were unaltered for this mutant (Fig. 1, C and D). Identical results were obtained with alanine or methionine substitutions (data not shown). In contrast, substituting a negatively charged residue at position 40, such as an aspartate residue, resulted in a number of alterations, specifically the absence of β-amyloid (Fig. 1B and Table I) and carboxyl-terminal fragments (Fig. 1C), as well as a lack of glycosylation of nascent β-APP (Fig. 1D). Identical results were obtained with an arginine substitution at this site (data not shown). The effects of a charged amino acid substitution at position 40, in particular the lack of secretory processing and carboxyl-terminal fragment generation, indicated that this β-APP mutant may not be capable of membrane insertion due to the addition of a charged residue within the transmembrane domain. This effect is consistent with previously determined dictums of protein membrane insertion (31Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 32Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). The introduction of a charged residue, aspartate, was next used to map the boundary of the membrane on the cytoplasmic or carboxyl-terminal side of the bilayer. Two identical substitutions, phenylalanine or aspartate, were constructed at position 48 of the β-amyloid domain (where position 1 is the amino-terminal aspartate of β-amyloid). Upon expression of each β-APP mutant, it was found that neither prevented the production of β-amyloid (Fig. 1B). Also, no negative influence was exerted by these mutations on the generation of carboxyl-terminal fragments or glycosylated β-APP, both reflecting secretory transport of the precursor (Fig. 1, C and D). Because the charged aspartate residue was tolerated at position 48, this suggested that the aspartate was not housed within the transmembrane domain of β-APP. To more precisely map the membrane boundary in this region, a series of aspartate mutants were made spanning positions 40-50. The results of this “aspartate walk” are shown in Fig. 2. β-Amyloid formation and secretory processing of β-APP in terms of carboxyl-terminal fragment generation were evident with substitutions at positions 48 and 50. Substitutions at positions 40, 44, and 45 each precluded β-amyloid formation, carboxyl-terminal generation, and β-APP glycosylation despite roughly equal synthesis of β-APP by all mutants. Table I summarizes the efficiency of β-amyloid formation for all mutants shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2. Although peptide levels were somewhat reduced for all mutants at positions 48 and 50, in contrast, production of β-amyloid was completely eliminated by the introduction of an aspartate residue between positions 40 and 45. The lack of ~4-kDa β-amyloid production by these mutants was likely due to the absence of β-APP secretory transport prevented by a lack of membrane insertion. Together these results suggest that the membrane boundary maps to position 46 or 47.TABLE I.β-Amyloid levels produced by carboxyl-terminal substitution mutations in transmembrane domain40 VIAT44 V45 IVI48 TL50 Vβ-amyloid levelsaβ-Amyloid levels were normalized for the amount of β-APP produced by each transfected DNA relative to wild-type β-APP.

These deletions were made in order to examine the sequence specificity for the processing step yielding the carboxyl terminus of β-amyloid. Five different deletions of 4 residues each were prepared and analyzed for their ability to form β-amyloid. In toto, positions 39-52 were studied. A schematic representation of these nested deletion mutants is illustrated in Fig. 3A. Deleting successive blocks of 4 amino acids in this region did not eliminate β-amyloid formation (Fig. 3B). In addition, β-APP maturation was normal and identical to that for wild-type β-APP (Fig. 3C). While an ~4-kDa β-amyloid peptide was detected for each mutant, one mutant (39Ladror U.S. Snyder S.W.

This may be due to displaced cleavage or to an altered mobility due to peptide sequence. We favor the idea of displaced cleavage, since proline substitution mutants at position 40 or 42 do not alter β-amyloid production but appear to change the site of cleavage in this domain. 2E. Tischer and B. Cordell, manuscript in preparation. A larger deletion was also made that encompassed positions 46-52 (see Fig. 3A). Unlike the shorter deletions, this mutant did not produce β-amyloid or mature β-APP (Fig. 3, B and C). The profile of this mutant is identical to those that precluded β-APP membrane insertion. The native lysine, formerly at position 53 but moved to position 46 by this deletion, is likely to have blocked membrane insertion, which is consistent with mapping the face of the bilayer to position 46 or 47 as determined in the preceding experiments. The efficiency of β-amyloid production for each deletion mutant was calculated (Table II). The large deletion spanning residues 46-52 did not produce significant amounts of β-amyloid for reasons mentioned above. Four amino acid deletions collectively encompassing residues 45-52 did not substantially alter peptide levels. Some reduction in efficiency of β-amyloid production was noted when residues spanning 39-42 and 41-44 were deleted, but a reproducible loss in efficiency of γ-secretase cleavage was noted when residues 43-46 were removed.Fig. 3Deletion mutagenesis in carboxyl-terminal region of β-amyloid domain.

The protein migrating below the 4-kDa β-amyloid peptide is not the 3-kDa peptide but rather an alterative β-secretase cleavage product with an amino terminus beginning at position 10 (Ref. 16Higaki J.

Open table in a new tab Based on the results from series of four amino acid deletions, it appears that the protein sequence from positions 39-52 need not be exactly maintained for γ-secretase cleavage. It can be noticed, however, that each deletion mutant reconstructed a new hydrophobic sequence in this region of processing. Therefore, it is possible that the requirements of γ-secretase cleavage rely more on a hydrophobic stretch of residues than on the unique order of individual hydrophobic amino acids. To further investigate γ-secretase cleavage specificity, two replacement mutants were constructed using the transmembrane sequence from an entirely different protein, the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, HER2 (33Coussens L. Yang L. Feng T.L. Liao Y.L. Chen E. Grey A. McGrath J. Seeburg P.H. Libermann T.A. Schlessinger J. Francke U. Levinson A. Ullrich A. Science. 1985; 230: 1129-1132Crossref Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). Because transmembrane domains are composed of a limited subset of amino acids, the EGF receptor transmembrane domain was selected for this experiment because its sequence is more divergent from the β-APP transmembrane sequence as compared with a number of other type 1 membrane-spanning proteins. For one replacement mutant, 18 residues of β-APP were removed, and 18 residues from a comparable position in the EGF receptor were added. For the second mutant, positions 38-47 of β-APP were replaced with 10 residues of the EGF receptor again obtained from an analogous locale. Fig. 4A provides an illustration of both constructs. Transient expression of each β-APP:EGF receptor chimeric mutant indicated that both efficiently produced a ~4-kDa β-amyloid peptide and generated a typical pattern of β-APP carboxyl-terminal fragments (Fig. 4, B and C). The efficiency of β-amyloid formation was determined for the two chimeric mutants, and both were found to be acceptable substrates for γ-secretase: Δ37-47 β-APP:EGF Rc and Δ39-56 β-APP:EGF Rc for β-amyloid with a 93% and 81% efficiency, respectively, relative to wild-type β-APP. It should be noted, however, that cleavage efficiency may actually be lower should the processing of the chimeric substrates result in inclusion of the additional methionine residues donated from the EGF receptor moiety in this domain. In any case, this result confirms our previous observation that γ-secretase cleavage may favor a unique array of individual residues but that if these residues are conservatively altered, processing can nevertheless occur.Fig. 4EGF receptor substitution mutagenesis of β-APP β-amyloid carboxyl-terminal region.

Several factors confound this β-APP processing step including 1) significant heterogeneity observed for the β-amyloid carboxyl terminus spanning 6 residues (positions 38-43) (25Asami-Odaka A.

Specifically, we were interested in defining the sequence specificity of γ-secretase cleavage. Limited information has been available on the molecular details of this processing step. We have previously demonstrated that γ-secretase cleavage occurs in the early endosome, an organelle that can be derived directly from the trans-Golgi network and/or from the internalization of plasma membrane (16Higaki J. Quon D. Zhong Z. Cordell B. Neuron. 1995; 14: 651-659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).

Escherichia coli does not amass these granules; however, small amounts of low molecular weight PHB (<0.02% of dry weight) have been found in the plasma membranes in complexes with calcium polyphosphate; the complexes serve as voltage-activated calcium channels. Here we report that polyphosphate-complexed PHB is only a minor fraction of the polyester in E. coli. PHB comprises 0.36 to 0.55% of the dry weight of log-phase cells, depending on culture medium, and this amount increases by 15 to 20% when the cells are made genetically competent. The PHB is widely distributed throughout the cell, wherein it is primarily associated with proteins. The identity of protein-associated PHB was established by antibody reaction, chemical assay, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. As expected, the physical and chemical properties of protein-associated PHB were found to be considerably different from those of the bulk polymer or granule PHB, e.g. protein-PHB complexes are normally insoluble in chloroform, soluble in water and alkaline hypochlorite, and are converted to crotonic acid more slowly on heating in concentrated sulfuric acid. Our studies indicate that the majority of cellular PHB (over 80%) is located in cytoplasmic proteins, especially proteins of the ribosomal fraction. Western immunoblots, probed with polyclonal anti-PHB IgG, revealed a number of PHB-polypeptides having a wide range of molecular weights in all cell fractions. These results suggest that PHB is a fundamental constituent of cells that may have physiological functions in addition to facilitating ion transmembrane transport or serving as a carbon reserve.

Here, we demonstrate that Stat6, previously shown to be activated by only IL-4 and IL-3, becomes activated after PDGF stimulation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. PDGF BB, and to a lesser extent PDGF AA, rapidly induced DNA binding activity from NIH 3T3 cell lysates utilizing the immunoglobulin heavy chain germ line ϵ promoter (Iϵ) that specifically binds to Stat6 in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. DNA binding activity could be detected within 5 min and reached maximum levels at approximately 20 min in parental NIH 3T3 cells. An identical mobility shift and time course of PDGF-mediated Iϵ binding activity was more pronounced in lysates of NIH 3T3 transfectants overexpressing human Stat6 (NIH 3T3-Stat6). The observed radiolabeled Iϵ mobility shift was competed by unlabeled Iϵ as well as by the β-casein gene promoter but not by the interferon-α-stimulated response element or the interferon-γ response region of the guanylate-binding protein gene. A Stat6-specific polyclonal antisera also supershifted the PDGF-induced Iϵ mobility shift. After PDGF BB treatment, a 100-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated species was detected in anti-Stat6 immunoprecipitates. Cycloheximide had little effect on Stat6 tyrosine phosphorylation.

INTRODUCTIONInflammation, immune responses, and wound repair involve the interplay of multiple growth factors and cytokines. Among these modulators and promoters of growth are platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) 1The abbreviations used are: PDGFplatelet-derived growth factorILinterleukinEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayGRRinterferon-γ, response regionβCASβ-casein gene promoterISREinterferon-α-stimulated response elementGASinterferon γ-activated sitesIRSinsulin receptor substratemAbmonoclonal antibodyRreceptorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and interleukin-4 (IL-4). PDGF is a major mitogen and chemotactic factor for mesenchymal cells such as fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (1Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar, 2Heldin C.-H. Westermark B. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1991; 2: 109-124PubMed Google Scholar). Although PDGF plays an important role in normal development, accumulating evidence suggests that its abnormal expression also contributes to a variety of diseases including cancer (1Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar, 2Heldin C.-H. Westermark B. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1991; 2: 109-124PubMed Google Scholar). PDGF exists as disulfide-linked homo- or heterodimers composed of two polypeptide chains encoded by distinct genes, designated PDGF A and PDGF B. PDGF BB is the human homologue of the v-sis oncogene product (3Devare S.G. Reddy E.P. Law D.J. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 4Doolittle R.F. Hunkapiller M.W. Hood L.E. Devare S.G. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Antoniades H.M.

Nature. 1983; 304: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). PDGF AA activates only the α PDGF receptor, whereas PDGF BB activates both α and β PDGF receptors.IL-4 is a cytokine that plays an important role in the regulation of inflammatory and cell-mediated immune responses (6Paul W.E. Blood. 1991; 77: 1859-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T cells, mast cells, and basophils produce IL-4. IL-4 plays a major role in mediating differentiation effects of B cells. It causes transcription of unrearranged constant regions for IgE and IgG1 leading to isotype class switching and subsequent synthesis of IgE (7Coffman R.L. Ohara J. Bond W. Carty J. Zlotnick E. Paul W.E. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 4538-4541PubMed Google Scholar) and IgG1 (8Vitetta E.S. Ohara J. Myers C. Layton J. Krammer P.H. Paul W.E. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 1726-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). IL-4 also induces or increases the expression of myosin heavy chain class II molecules (9Noelle R. Krammer P.H. Ohara J.

A. 1988; 85: 8221-8225Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Recently, IL-4 has been shown to be the major regulator of the lymphokine-producing phenotype of CD4+ T lymphocytes (12Seder R.A. Paul W.E. Dvorak A.M. Sharkis S.J. Kagey-Sobotka A. Niv Y. Finkelman F.D. Barbieri S.A. Galli S.J. Plant M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2835-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that IL-4 modulates functional responses such as extracellular matrix production (13Postlethwaite A.E. Holness M.A. Katai H. Raghow R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1479-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and chemotaxis (14Postlethwaite A.E. Seyer J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), rather than inducing pronounced proliferative effects in fibroblasts (13Postlethwaite A.E. Holness M.A. Katai H. Raghow R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1479-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). IL-4 has also been demonstrated to regulate the morphology and cytoskeletal organization of human vascular endothelial cells (15Schleimer R.P. Sterbinsky S.A. Kaiser J. Bicket C.A. Klunk D.A. Tomioka K. Newman W. Luscinskas F.W. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. McIntyre B.W. Bochner B.S. J. Immunol. 1992; 198: 1086-1092Google Scholar). Some diseases such as scleroderma have been characterized by increased serum levels of IL-4 (16Needleman B.W. Wigley F.M. Stair R.W. Arthritis & Rheum. 1991; 35: 67-72Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar).The IL-4 receptor was originally isolated as a single chain molecule with a large intracellular domain of over 500 amino acids (17Galizzi J.-P.

Cell. 1989; 59: 335-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). This receptor, commonly designated IL-4Rα, possesses all the characteristics of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily. It has been demonstrated to become phosphorylated on tyrosine residue(s) upon IL-4 treatment (21Wang L.-M. Keegan A.D. Paul W.E. Heidaran M.A. Gutkind J.S. Pierce J.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4899-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Unlike several members of the hematopoietin receptor family, IL-4Rα is ubiquitously expressed on cells of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic origin. Recently, it has been shown that the IL-2Rγ chain, designated γc, is a shared component in the IL-4 receptor complex (22Kondo M. Takeshita T. Ishii N. Nakamura M. Watanabe S. Arai K. Sugamura K.

Phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the two GYKXF motifs present in IL-4Rα has been proposed to be crucial for binding to and activating Stat6 (28Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J.

Stat activation represents a novel signaling pathway that has been correlated with mitogenic and pleiotropic functional responses induced by a variety of growth factors, cytokines and interferons (33Darnell Jr., J.E.

Horvath C.M. Huang L.H.T. Qureshi S. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The Stats have been shown to bind with different affinities to a variety of DNA motifs related to interferon γ-activated sites (GAS). Therefore, it is likely that these differences as well as differences in Stat expression determine the transcriptional sequence that is activated and subsequent proliferation or differentiation events that occur in a given cell in response to this activation (39Schindler U. Wu P. Rothe M. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Immunity. 1995; 2: 689-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The role of Stats in signaling through noncytokine receptors such as the tyrosine kinase receptors remains to be determined. However, it has been demonstrated that epidermal growth factor activates Stats 1, 3, and 5 (40Coffer P.J. Kruijer W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Furthermore, our results provide evidence that IL-4 can act to enhance PDGF-induced Iϵ binding activity, Jak1 activation, and fibroblast proliferation, suggesting that IL-4 might synergize with PDGF to enhance PDGF-mediated biological responses in vivo.DISCUSSIONThe Stats selectively bind to DNA transcriptional elements and activate the transcription of genes that are often associated with differentiation functions and phenotypic changes (33Darnell Jr., J.E.

Prior to this study, Stat6 activation was thought to be limited to IL-4 and IL-3 (30Quelle F.W. Shimoda K. Thierfelder W. Fischer C. Kim A. Ruben S.M. Cleveland J.L. Pierce J.H. Keegan A.D. Nelms K.

S. A. 1995; 92: 7971-7975Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We were able to demonstrate that the PDGFRs activate Jak1 which is activated by the IL-4R as well. Additionally, we were able to demonstrate a direct association between Jak1 and PDGFRs in Jak1 immunoprecipitates.4 Recent evidence suggests that none of the Jaks appear to be individually required for PDGFR activation of Stat1 or Stat3 (50Vignais M.-L. Sadowski H.B. Watling D. Rogers N.C. Gilman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1759-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and that Src kinases are also able to constitutively activate the DNA binding activity of Stat3 (51Yu C.-L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). c-Src has also been identified as a PDGFR substrate (52Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 481-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Whether Jak1, c-Src, or another intracellular kinase (53Danial N.N. Pernis A. Rothman P.B. Science. 1995; 269: 1875-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) mediate PDGFR activation of Stat6 is currently under investigation.We demonstrated that induction of Stat6 Iϵ binding activity, Jak1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and mitogenesis are enhanced when NIH 3T3 cells are treated with both IL-4 and PDGF. Whether these observed synergies are coincidental or directly related remains to be determined. However, the ability of IL-4 to synergize mitogenically with PDGF AA and BB was comparable, while PDGF BB induced a much more pronounced Stat6 binding activity than PDGF AA. Additionally, IL-4 activates Stat6 in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts but induces only a minor increase in [3H]thymidine uptake. Furthermore, PDGF/IL-4 mitogenic synergy was not significantly increased in NIH 3T3-Stat6 transfectants compared with parental NIH 3T3, although these transfectants possessed a higher background as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation. 5B. K. R. Patel and W. J. LaRochelle, unpublished observations. Whether this result reflects lack of Stat6 involvement in mitogenesis or saturation of Stat6 signaling pathways involved in mitogenesis remains to be resolved.During the course of these studies two publications have strongly implicated Stat6 in T lymphocyte proliferation (54Kaplan M.H.

Nature. 1996; 380: 630-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that the activation of Stat6 may be necessary but not sufficient for mediating optimal mitogenesis (30Quelle F.W. Shimoda K. Thierfelder W. Fischer C. Kim A. Ruben S.M. Cleveland J.L. Pierce J.H. Keegan A.D. Nelms K. Paul W.E. Ihle J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3336-3343Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Certainly, other signaling molecules (37David M. Petricoin E. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) are potential candidates for mediating the observed biological synergy. IL-4 has been demonstrated to induce potent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in hematopoietic cells, leading to the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, GRB2, and several other SH2-containing molecules (27Wang L.-M. Keegan A.D. Li W. Lienhard G.E. Pacini S. Gutkind J.S. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.-J. White M.F. Aaronson S.A. Paul W.E. Pierce J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our previous data also demonstrated that expression of either IRS-1 or IRS-2 in the IL-3-dependent hematopoietic 32D cell line was required for eliciting IL-4-induced mitogenesis (27Wang L.-M. Keegan A.D. Li W. Lienhard G.E. Pacini S. Gutkind J.S. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.-J. White M.F. Aaronson S.A. Paul W.E. Pierce J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4032-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, we observed extremely weak IL-4-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and no IRS-2 phosphorylation in NIH 3T3 cells, and PDGF did not stimulate any detectable IRS-1 or IRS-2 phosphorylation. 6L. M. Wang and C. C. Lee, unpublished observations. Thus, our preliminary data suggest that IRS-1 and IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation do not contribute to PDGF-induced DNA synthesis or the observed IL-4-mediated synergy in fibroblasts.In addition to Stat6, the PDGF-mediated signal transduction pathway has been linked to Stat1 and 3 activation. Stat1 is also activated by a variety of other cytokines and growth factors including interferon, IL-3, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, growth hormone, epidermal growth factor, and GM-CSF, suggesting that Stat1 binds multiple transcriptional targets and results in a plethora of effects (reviewed in Refs. 34Ihle J.N.

Stat3 or SIF is activated by IL-2, IL-6, interferon-α, and G-CSF leading to transcription of a set of genes that include the serum response element of the c-fos promoter (57Taniguchi T. Science. 1995; 268: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 58Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev.

Cancer. 1995; 71: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), the role of the Stats in carcinogenesis is actively under investigation.In summary, our results provide direct evidence that Stat6 and Jak1 can be activated in nonhematopoietic cells by a tyrosine kinase-containing receptor. While the biological role of Jak1 and Stat6 activation in fibroblasts remains to be determined, IL-4 and PDGF both elevate the expression of extracellular matrix proteins including collagen (13Postlethwaite A.E.

Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Moreover, the levels of IL-4 and PDGF are coincidently increased in the fibrotic disease scleroderma (16Needleman B.W. Wigley F.M. Stair R.W. Arthritis & Rheum. 1991; 35: 67-72Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 62Gay S. Jones R.E. Guo-qiang H. Gay R.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 301-303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elucidation of the genes that are transcriptionally regulated in this context by Stat6 should reveal potential roles in the proliferation, differentiation, and functional responses in cells of fibroblast origin. INTRODUCTIONInflammation, immune responses, and wound repair involve the interplay of multiple growth factors and cytokines. Among these modulators and promoters of growth are platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) 1The abbreviations used are: PDGFplatelet-derived growth factorILinterleukinEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayGRRinterferon-γ, response regionβCASβ-casein gene promoterISREinterferon-α-stimulated response elementGASinterferon γ-activated sitesIRSinsulin receptor substratemAbmonoclonal antibodyRreceptorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and interleukin-4 (IL-4). PDGF is a major mitogen and chemotactic factor for mesenchymal cells such as fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (1Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar, 2Heldin C.-H. Westermark B. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1991; 2: 109-124PubMed Google Scholar). Although PDGF plays an important role in normal development, accumulating evidence suggests that its abnormal expression also contributes to a variety of diseases including cancer (1Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar, 2Heldin C.-H. Westermark B. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1991; 2: 109-124PubMed Google Scholar). PDGF exists as disulfide-linked homo- or heterodimers composed of two polypeptide chains encoded by distinct genes, designated PDGF A and PDGF B. PDGF BB is the human homologue of the v-sis oncogene product (3Devare S.G. Reddy E.P. Law D.J. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PDGF AA activates only the α PDGF receptor, whereas PDGF BB activates both α and β PDGF receptors.IL-4 is a cytokine that plays an important role in the regulation of inflammatory and cell-mediated immune responses (6Paul W.E. Blood. 1991; 77: 1859-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T cells, mast cells, and basophils produce IL-4. IL-4 plays a major role in mediating differentiation effects of B cells. It causes transcription of unrearranged constant regions for IgE and IgG1 leading to isotype class switching and subsequent synthesis of IgE (7Coffman R.L. Ohara J. Bond W. Carty J. Zlotnick E. Paul W.E. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 4538-4541PubMed Google Scholar) and IgG1 (8Vitetta E.S. Ohara J. Myers C. Layton J. Krammer P.H. Paul W.E. J. Exp.

INTRODUCTION3′:5′-Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) 1The abbreviations used are: PDEs3′:5′-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterasescGB-PDEcGMP-binding, cGMP-specific phosphodiesteraseIBMX3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthineCAPE. coli catabolite gene activator protein. catalyze the hydrolysis of 3′:5′-cyclic nucleotides to the corresponding nucleoside 5′-monophosphates. On the basis of their regulatory features and substrate specificities, the multiple PDEs can be classified into at least seven major families, three of which exhibit cGMP-binding sites that are distinct from sites of cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis (1Beavo J.A. Conti M. Heaslip R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 399-405PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of their amino acid sequences reveals a conserved segment located toward the N terminus, which has been proposed to constitute an allosteric cGMP-binding region. This region consists of two similar blocks of conserved residues: block a = NKX5 or 7FX3DE and block b = N(K/R)X4 or 10FX3DE. These internally homologous repeats were postulated to be contained in two cGMP-binding sites, a and b, which have different affinities for cGMP (2McAllister-Lucas L.M. Sonnenburg W.K. Kadlecek A. Seger D.L. Trong H.L. Colbran J.L. Thomas M.K. Walsh K.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22863-22873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Recently, studies of site-directed mutagenesis of the cGMP-binding, cGMP-specific PDE (cGB-PDE; PDE 5A) (3McAllister-Lucas L.M. Haik T.L. Colbran J.L. Sonnenburg W.K. Seger D. Turko I.V. Beavo J.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30671-30679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) provided evidence for the importance of Asp289 in block a and Asp478 in block b for cGMP binding. These two residues are the first amino acid residues to be identified as critical for cGMP binding in allosteric sites of cGMP-binding PDEs. [32P]cGMP dissociation kinetics of each of the mutant cGB-PDEs identified site a and site b as the high affinity site and low affinity site, respectively.Since the discovery of cyclic nucleotides, the characterization of cAMP and cGMP binding to their receptors has been the subject of intense investigations. As a result, the cyclic nucleotide-binding sites of catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) (4Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (5Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Bubis J. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Weber I.T. Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6122-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 7Su Y.

Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), and the cGMP-gated cation channels (8Kumar V.D. Weber I.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4643-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have been described in detail. The major interactions for all of these proteins are similar: glutamic acid bonds with the ribose 2′-OH, while arginine forms an ion pair with the charged phosphate oxygen. The cGMP-binding sites of cGMP-binding PDEs do not exhibit any sequence similarity with CAP-related proteins (9Beltman J. Becker D.E. Butt E. Jensen G.S. Rybalkin S.D. Jastorff B. Beavo J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 330-339PubMed Google Scholar), and the cyclic nucleotide-binding characteristics between these two families of proteins are quite different. In order to probe the structural elements that contribute to cGMP binding and to develop a better understanding of the functions of these elements in the cGMP-binding sites of PDEs, five mutants in the invariant N276KX7FX3DE290 sequence of site a of cGB-PDE were generated. N276A, K277A, K277R, D289A, and E290A mutants were expressed in insect High Five cells, and then purified. These mutations were selected in part because of the resemblance of the N276KX7FX3DE290 sequence to the canonical NKXD motif in GTP-binding proteins (10Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Based on the results presented here and the published data regarding structural requirements for cGMP binding to different PDEs generated using cyclic nucleotide analogs (9Beltman J. Becker D.E. Butt E. Jensen G.S. Rybalkin S.D. Jastorff B. Beavo J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 330-339PubMed Google Scholar, 11Erneux C. Couchie D. Dumont J.E. Jastorff B. Adv.

Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 25: 45-53PubMed Google Scholar), we propose a role of each residue in the putative NKXnD motif and introduce a theory for a new class of cGMP-binding site.DISCUSSIONRecombinant bovine lung cGB-PDE has been overexpressed in High Five cells and purified. The properties of recombinant and native enzymes are similar. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Asn276, Lys277, Asp289, and Glu290 residues in site a of cGB-PDE was performed in order to estimate the importance of these residues for cGMP binding. Site a of the cGB-PDE was selected for the mutations since it was found that D478A mutation in site b produced only a slight effect compared with that of site a (D289A) (3McAllister-Lucas L.M. Haik T.L. Colbran J.L. Sonnenburg W.K. Seger D. Turko I.V. Beavo J.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30671-30679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The results presented herein are consistent with our earlier proposal that site a is the higher affinity site that displays the slower dissociation rate. Comparison of the Kd values of the mutant and wild-type cGB-PDEs demonstrates that mutation of the Asn276, Lys277, or Asp289 residue causes a marked loss in cGMP-binding affinity for site a, but the relative contribution of these amino acid residues is difficult to precisely quantitate. All mutant cGB-PDEs have essentially the same catalytic activity as that of wild-type cGB-PDE, suggesting that the effects on cGMP binding properties are not due to a generalized structural alteration of the mutated enzymes. The findings also imply, but do not rigorously prove, that cGMP-binding to site b is not decreased appreciably by loss in affinity of site a.The N276KXnDE290 sequence in site a has been presented as a putative NKXnD motif for cGMP binding. This motif can be considered as a working model for cGMP binding to the PDE-binding sites by drawing a parallel with the functions for each residue in the canonical NKXD motif in GTP-binding proteins (10Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 19Jurnak F.

Steitz T.A. Moore P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3661-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Thus, the properties and potential roles of asparagine, lysine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid in the N276KXnDE290 sequence of cGB-PDE are examined below.Asparagine 276Hydrogen bonding from the side chain of asparagine to the N-7 guanine ring nitrogen is absolutely conserved in the NKXD motif of GTP-binding proteins (23Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1994; 76: 201-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). cGMP analog studies examining the importance of the N-7 position of the allosteric cGMP-binding sites of PDEs suggest interaction at the N-7 ring nitrogen (11Erneux C. Couchie D. Dumont J.E. Jastorff B. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylation Res. 1984; 16: 107-117PubMed Google Scholar, 24Couchie D. Petridis G. Jastorff B. Erneux C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 136: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These data taken together suggest the possibility of an interaction between the N-7 ring nitrogen of cGMP and Asn276 of the putative NKXnD motif of cGB-PDE (Fig. 4).Lysine 277The most common role of lysine in the NKXD motif of GTP-binding proteins is to provide methylene carbons for van der Waals contacts with the guanine ring, although an interaction with the ribose moiety may also occur (23Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1994; 76: 201-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The replacement of Lys277 by the electrostatically conservative arginine did not cause a detectable alteration in the affinity of the cGB-PDE for cGMP, which is consistent with an important role for a positively charged amino acid residue in this position (Fig. 4). It should be noted that some cGMP-binding PDEs have arginine instead of lysine in this position in site b (2McAllister-Lucas L.M. Sonnenburg W.K. Kadlecek A. Seger D.L. Trong H.L. Colbran J.L. Thomas M.K. Walsh K.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22863-22873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a hydrophobic interaction between Lys277 and the guanine ring of cGMP is also possible.Aspartic Acid 289Carboxylate groups of aspartic acid in the NKXD consensus sequence of GTP-binding proteins interact simultaneously with both the C-2 exocyclic amino group and the hydrogen atom of the N-1 endo-nitrogen of the guanine base (23Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1994; 76: 201-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The results of cyclic nucleotide analog binding experiments show that an interaction at the N-1 position and a distinct lack of binding to the C-2 exocyclic amino group is common to all cGMP-binding PDEs (9Beltman J. Becker D.E. Butt E. Jensen G.S. Rybalkin S.D. Jastorff B. Beavo J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 330-339PubMed Google Scholar, 12Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Beebe S.J. Gettys T.W. Corbin J.D. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 25: 45-53PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in contrast to the role of aspartic acid in the NKXD motif of GTP-binding proteins, it is suggested that the Asp289 in the putative NKXnD cGMP-binding motif of cGB-PDE interacts with the N-1 endo-nitrogen only, and does not interact with the C-2 exocyclic amino group (Fig. 4).Glutamic Acid 290Glutamic acid is invariant in both binding sites of cGMP-binding PDEs (2McAllister-Lucas L.M. Sonnenburg W.K. Kadlecek A. Seger D.L. Trong H.L. Colbran J.L. Thomas M.K. Walsh K.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol.

In addition, a critical role of this conserved amino acid for cyclic nucleotide binding to CAP-related proteins has been described (25Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5723-5726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, E290A mutation had no detectable effects on cGMP affinity. Apparently, Glu290 does not interact with cGMP, which is consistent with the lack of a role for a glutamic acid residue in GTP-binding proteins.In summary, based on the findings reported here, on results of cyclic nucleotide analog studies (9Beltman J.

INTRODUCTION3′:5′-Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) 1The abbreviations used are: PDEs3′:5′-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterasescGB-PDEcGMP-binding, cGMP-specific phosphodiesteraseIBMX3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthineCAPE. coli catabolite gene activator protein. catalyze the hydrolysis of 3′:5′-cyclic nucleotides to the corresponding nucleoside 5′-monophosphates. On the basis of their regulatory features and substrate specificities, the multiple PDEs can be classified into at least seven major families, three of which exhibit cGMP-binding sites that are distinct from sites of cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis (1Beavo J.A. Conti M. Heaslip R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 399-405PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of their amino acid sequences reveals a conserved segment located toward the N terminus, which has been proposed to constitute an allosteric cGMP-binding region. This region consists of two similar blocks of conserved residues: block a = NKX5 or 7FX3DE and block b = N(K/R)X4 or 10FX3DE. These internally homologous repeats were postulated to be contained in two cGMP-binding sites, a and b, which have different affinities for cGMP (2McAllister-Lucas L.M. Sonnenburg W.K. Kadlecek A. Seger D.L. Trong H.L. Colbran J.L. Thomas M.K. Walsh K.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol.

Haik T.L. Colbran J.L. Sonnenburg W.K. Seger D. Turko I.V. Beavo J.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol.

These two residues are the first amino acid residues to be identified as critical for cGMP binding in allosteric sites of cGMP-binding PDEs. [32P]cGMP dissociation kinetics of each of the mutant cGB-PDEs identified site a and site b as the high affinity site and low affinity site, respectively.Since the discovery of cyclic nucleotides, the characterization of cAMP and cGMP binding to their receptors has been the subject of intense investigations. As a result, the cyclic nucleotide-binding sites of catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) (4Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (5Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Bubis J. Taylor S.S.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4643-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have been described in detail. The major interactions for all of these proteins are similar: glutamic acid bonds with the ribose 2′-OH, while arginine forms an ion pair with the charged phosphate oxygen. The cGMP-binding sites of cGMP-binding PDEs do not exhibit any sequence similarity with CAP-related proteins (9Beltman J. Becker D.E. Butt E. Jensen G.S. Rybalkin S.D. Jastorff B. Beavo J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 330-339PubMed Google Scholar), and the cyclic nucleotide-binding characteristics between these two families of proteins are quite different. In order to probe the structural elements that contribute to cGMP binding and to develop a better understanding of the functions of these elements in the cGMP-binding sites of PDEs, five mutants in the invariant N276KX7FX3DE290 sequence of site a of cGB-PDE were generated. N276A, K277A, K277R, D289A, and E290A mutants were expressed in insect High Five cells, and then purified. These mutations were selected in part because of the resemblance of the N276KX7FX3DE290 sequence to the canonical NKXD motif in GTP-binding proteins (10Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar).

INTRODUCTIONRecently, a family of water channels has been identified that facilitate water permeability in a variety of tissues.

AQP1 (previously named CHIP28) is a 28-kDa protein that is the prototype AQP and was first isolated from red blood cells (1Denker B.M. Smith B.L. Kuhajda F.P. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15634-15642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Preston G.M. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

AQP5, recently cloned from rat submandibular glands, is present in the water transporting epithelia of lacrimal glands, trachea, eye, lung, and salivary glands (4Raina S. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1908-1912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Topographically, it has been localized to the apical membranes in salivary and lacrimal glands (5Agre P. Brown D. Nielsen S. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 472-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).Replication-deficient recombinant adenoviruses have been used for efficient gene transfer to mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo (6Rosenfeld M.A. Siegfried W.

Genet. 1993; 3: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that such recombinant adenoviruses can effectively transfer genes to rat and human salivary cell lines in vitro, to all the major rat salivary glands in vivo, and to human minor glands ex vivo (13Mastrangeli A. O'Connell B. Alabib W. Fox P.C. Baum B.J. Crystal R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G1146-G1155PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to construct a recombinant adenovirus directing the expression of a functional AQP5 in order to examine the effects of introducing a facilitated water-permeable pathway into epithelial cells.RESULTSA replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus expressing AQP5, the mercurial-sensitive water channel reportedly localized to the apical membrane of acinar cells of rat submandibular glands (5Agre P. Brown D. Nielsen S. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 472-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), was constructed by homologous recombination between the pCMVrAQP5 and pJM17 plasmids in 293 cells (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1). Two weeks following the cotransfection, there was evidence of cytopathic effects in the 293 cells. At 19 days, the cells were harvested, and CVL, containing the recombinant adenovirus AdrAQP5, was used to infect other 293 cells.Twenty-four hours after subsequent infection of confluent 293 cells, poly(A) mRNA was obtained from total RNA, and Northern blot analysis was performed (Fig. 2A). No AQP5 transcript was detected in untreated control 293 cells or in 293 cells infected with Adα1AT (i.e. the irrelevant virus coding for alpha1-antitrypsin). However, in 293 cells infected with the CVL, abundant amounts of a hybridization-positive transcript of ~1.6 kilobases were detected.To detect the production of AQP5 protein, we developed an antibody directed against a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 25 amino acids of AQP5. This antibody was affinity purified, and its specificity was determined by Western blot analysis. Different dilutions were used to detect the native AQP5 found in rat submandibular gland membranes (Fig. 2B). Rat submandibular gland but not rat kidney membranes showed two regions of immunoreactivity; one band ~of 27 kDa the other band of ~45 kDa. The former corresponds to a nonglycosylated AQP5 monomer. The latter does not represent a glycosylated form of AQP5, because it did not disappear after N-glycanase treatment, whereas the higher molecular weight form of AQP1 (1Denker B.M. Smith B.L. Kuhajda F.P. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15634-15642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was converted to a ~28-kDa band after such treatment (data not shown). When increasing concentrations of submandibular membranes were electrophoresed, the upper band increased in a linear fashion but with a slope markedly different from the monomeric form (data not shown). Thus, the upper band likely represents a dimer of AQP5 that runs anomalously on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; a known characteristic of integral membrane proteins (20Silverberg M. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 95-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Denker et al. (1Denker B.M. Smith B.L. Kuhajda F.P. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15634-15642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, AQP1 also was detected as both a monomeric band (~28 kDa) plus several oligomers. Similar Western blot patterns were seen with 1:500, 1:1000, and 1:2000 dilutions of the affinity-purified antibody. Based on these results the affinity-purified antibody was routinely used at the dilution 1:2000. As shown in Fig. 2C, under these conditions the detection of native AQP5 in rat submandibular gland membranes was linear between 2.5-10 µg of membrane protein.We next used this affinity purified antibody to monitor the plaque purification of AdrAQP5. When 293 cells were infected with CVL, AQP5 protein could be readily detected in crude membranes (not shown). All plaques selected gave positive results showing expression of AQP5. Subsequently, we chose one plaque for large scale production and purification on CsCl gradients. The titer of the final purified AdrAQP5, as determined by plaque assay, was 8.5 × 1011 plaque-forming units/ml. As shown in Fig. 3; when 293 cells were infected with AdrAQP5, AQP5 protein could be detected in crude membrane preparations after Western blot analysis.Fig. 3Expression of AQP5 protein in 293 cells infected with AdrAQP5. 10 µg of crude membranes from uninfected 293 cells (lane 1) or 293 cells infected with AdrAQP5 (lane 2) were analyzed by Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next infected several epithelial cell lines with AdrAQP5. MDCK is a well studied dog kidney-derived cell line, whereas HSG, A5, and SMIE cells are derived from salivary epithelia (human, rat, and rat, respectively). Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were harvested and crude membranes were prepared. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of AQP5 protein in all AdrAQP5-infected epithelial cell lines (Fig. 4). Conversely, no AQP5 protein band could be detected in uninfected cells or in cells that were infected with the irrelevant virus, Adα1AT.Fig. 4AQP5 expression in AdrAQP5-infected MDCK, HSG, A5, and SMIE cells. 10 µg of crude membranes from MDCK (lanes 1-3), HSG (lanes 4-6), A5 (lanes 7-9), and SMIE (lanes 10-12) cells were analyzed by Western blot. The cells were either uninfected (lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10), infected at a m.o.i. of 10 of Adα1AT (lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11), or infected at a m.o.i. of 10 of AdrAQP5 (lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)MDCK cells grown on collagen-coated permeable filters form polarized monolayers with distinct apical and basolateral membranes (21Cereijido M.

MDCK cells were either not infected or infected for 3 days at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of either 10 or 100 of Ad.RSVβGal at either the apical or basolateral side or both sides. No β-galactosidase activity was detected in noninfected MDCK cells (Fig. 5, well 1). When MDCK cells were infected at the apical side at a m.o.i. of either 100 (Fig. 5, well 3) or 10 (Fig. 5, well 5) of Ad.RSVβGal, little β-galactosidase activity was apparent. However, when MDCK cells were infected at the basolateral side at a m.o.i. of either 100 (Fig. 5, well 2) or 10 (Fig. 5, well 6) of Ad.RSVβGal or at both apical and basolateral sides at a m.o.i. of 100 of Ad.RSVβGal (Fig. 5, well 4), considerable β-galactosidase activity was seen.Fig. 5Efficiency of adenovirus infection in MDCK cells using Ad.RSVβGal.

Wilson J.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5951-5958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we speculated that the above differences in β-galactosidase expression were due to the distribution of integrin receptors in these cells. We looked for the presence of such receptors in polarized MDCK cells by confocal microscopy using antibodies directed against alpha-V, beta-3, and beta-5 integrin subunit proteins. Using the antibodies available, we observed that MDCK cells expressed the alpha-V, beta-3 integrin protein subunits on the plasma membranes (Fig., 6, A and C) and more specifically at their lateral domain, as shown by vertical optical sections of the cells (Fig. 6, B and D). No evidence for the beta-5 integrin subunit was found.Fig. 6Localization of integrin receptors in MDCK cells. MDCK cells grown on filters were labeled using mouse anti-human integrin alpha-V monoclonal antibody (A and B) and mouse anti-human beta-3 monoclonal antibody (C and D) integrin protein and examined by confocal microscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Micrographs of horizontal (xy; A and C), and vertical (xz; B and D) optical sections through cells are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next examined cells grown in this manner to localize the cellular sites of AQP5 expression by confocal microscopy. Uninfected cells and cells infected at the basolateral side at a m.o.i. of 100 of Adα1AT showed no AQP5 expression (Fig. 7, A-D). However, when cells were infected at a m.o.i. of 100 of AdrAQP5, AQP5 protein was highly expressed. AQP5 expression in these cells was detected at both apical and basolateral sides of the plasma membrane (Fig. 7, E and F).Fig. 7Confocal microscopic localization of AQP5 expression in polarized MDCK cells. Confluent MDCK cells, grown on filters, were not infected (A and B) or infected at the basolateral side at a m.o.i. of 100 of Adα1AT (C and D) or at a m.o.i. of 100 of AdrAQP5 (E and F). The cells were then labeled for AQP5 and examined by confocal microscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Horizontal (xy; A, C, and E) and vertical (xz; B, D, and F) images are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In order to determine if the AQP5 expressed in AdrAQP5-infected cells affected their water permeability, we measured the transepithelial net fluid secretion rate in MDCK cells. MDCK cells, when grown on collagen-coated permeable filters, form a tight epithelium with a moderately high transepithelial resistance (21Cereijido M. Robbins E.S. Dolan W.J. Rotunno C.A. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell. Biol. 1978; 77: 853-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). It has been previously shown (19Neufeld T.K. Grant M.E. Grantham J.J. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1991; 13: 229-234Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that a low level of water secretion across this in vitro epithelial monolayer can be measured when the apical medium is replaced with mineral oil. Further, DBcAMP increases this net fluid secretion rate significantly (19Neufeld T.K. Grant M.E. Grantham J.J. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1991; 13: 229-234Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We used this method to examine in situ the function of AQP5. As shown in Table I, the measured rates were low but quite similar to those described by Neufeld et al. (Ref. 19Neufeld T.K. Grant M.E. Grantham J.J. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1991; 13: 229-234Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar; ~0.3 µl/cm2·h). However, no differences were seen in the net fluid secretion rates between control MDCK cells and those infected with either Adα1AT or AdrAQP5. We modified this experimental system to measure the net fluid secretion rate of MDCK cells under more physiological conditions, i.e. in the presence of a transepithelial (basolateral to apical) osmotic gradient. After 4 h of incubation, the net fluid secretion rates of control and Adα1AT-infected MDCK cells were not significantly different from each other but were considerably higher (~5-6×) than those described by Neufeld et al. (19Neufeld T.K. Grant M.E. Grantham J.J. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1991; 13: 229-234Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Importantly for the present studies, the net fluid secretion rate across AdrAQP5-infected MDCK cells was increased an additional 4-fold (Table I). These results demonstrated that the cells infected with AdrAQP5 show considerably more water permeability in response to an osmotic challenge than control cells or cells infected with an irrelevant virus.TABLE INet fluid secretion rates across MDCK monolayersWater flowControl (oil)DBcAMP (oil)400 mosmµl/cm2· hUninfected0.31 ± 0.030.54 ± 0.061.75 ± 0.31+ Adα1AT0.23 ± 0.040.49 ± 0.031.91 ± 0.21+ AdrAQP50.30 ± 0.020.45 ± 0.027.11 ± 0.89 Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONWe have successfully constructed a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus expressing AQP5. When 293 cells were infected with CVL, Northern blot analysis revealed a hybridization-positive band of ~1.6 kilobases. The ~1.6-kilobase transcript is of comparable size to the AQP5 transcript originally found in rat salivary glands, lacrimal gland, trachea, eye, and lung (4Raina S. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1908-1912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar).We developed (and affinity-purified) an antibody directed against a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 25 amino acids of AQP5. In uninfected 293 cells, AQP5 protein was not detected, whereas in 293 cells infected with AdrAQP5 CVL, AQP5 protein was readily detected. We used purified AdrAQP5 to infect other cell lines in vitro. In infected MDCK, HSG, A5, and SMIE cells, the primary immunopositive band observed in Western blots was the monomeric nonglycosylated AQP5. In salivary epithelial cells (HSG, A5, and SMIE) additional fainter immunopositive bands of higher molecular weight than monomeric AQP5 were detected. These might reflect the presence of aggregates between AQP5 protein or between AQP5 and other proteins.Using a recombinant adenovirus containing the LacZ (Ad.RSVβGal) gene encoding β-galactosidase, we showed that the infection of MDCK cells grown on permeable membranes was much more efficient when the cells were infected at their basolateral side. Because integrin receptors mediate the entry of adenoviruses in cells (22Goldman M.J. Wilson J.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5951-5958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined their localization in MDCK cells. Immunofluorescent labeling of relevant integrin receptors showed that the alpha-V, beta-3 integrin subunits were localized at the lateral side of polarized MDCK cells, consistent with the higher levels of β-galactosidase activity seen when MDCK cells were infected with Ad.RSVβGal at their basolateral side.Because AQP5 appears naturally localized to the apical membranes of expressing cells, we examined the sites of expression of virus-directed AQP5 in MDCK cells grown as a polarized monolayer on filters. In uninfected cells and cells infected with an irrelevant virus there was no AQP5 expression observed. When the cells were infected with AdrAQP5 at a m.o.i. of 100, AQP5 labeling was detected at the apical membrane as well as at the basolateral membrane. These results may reflect an inability of the MDCK cells to sort AQP5 to the “correct membrane” in vitro (as has been seen with AQP2 sorting in LLC-PK1 cells in vitro; Ref. 23Katsura T. Verbavatz J.-M. Farinas J. Ma T. Ausiello D.A. Verkman A.S. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7212-7216Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the inserted AQP5 cDNA may lack a necessary routing signal.The function of the recombinant AQP5 protein was determined in vitro in polarized MDCK cells (which are devoid of any endogenous AQP5) that were infected with AdrAQP5. As shown by Neufeld et al., (19Neufeld T.K. Grant M.E. Grantham J.J. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1991; 13: 229-234Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) when basal transepithelial fluid secretion is measured in MDCK cells, low levels of fluid movement could be detected and can be increased ~2-fold by DBcAMP. We observed similar results in uninfected MDCK cells and MDCK cells infected with either the irrelevant virus or AdrAQP5. Thus the presence of AQP5 did not modify fluid secretion under these experimental conditions. However, when net fluid secretion was evaluated under more physiological conditions, i.e. in the presence of a transepithelial osmotic gradient, the net fluid secretion rates of uninfected MDCK cells and of MDCK cells infected with the irrelevant virus were increased 5-6-fold as compared with the rates observed above. Importantly, in the MDCK cells infected with AdrAQP5 and exposed to this osmotic gradient there was an additional 4-fold higher net fluid secretion rate. These data clearly suggest that the recombinant AQP5 was indeed functional.In conclusion, the construction of a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus encoding AQP5 was successfully achieved. The recombinant virus can mediate the transfer and subsequent expression of the AQP5 cDNA in vitro as shown by Northern blot analysis, Western blot analysis, and confocal microscopy. Moreover, the function of the recombinant AQP5 was demonstrated by measurement of net fluid secretion rates in a cultured relatively “tight” epithelial cell line. To our knowledge, these data represent the first reported expression of functional AQP5 protein in mammalian epithelial cells in vitro. Thus, this virus should provide an efficient and useful means to impart facilitated water permeability to cells lacking such a pathway. INTRODUCTIONRecently, a family of water channels has been identified that facilitate water permeability in a variety of tissues. These proteins have been named aquaporins (AQPs), 1The abbreviations used are: AQPaquaporinMDCKMadin-Darby canine kidneyPBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminCVLcrude viral lysatem.o.i.multiplicity of infectionDBcAMPdibutyryl cyclic AMP. and five distinct members have been cloned from mammalian cells. AQP1 (previously named CHIP28) is a 28-kDa protein that is the prototype AQP and was first isolated from red blood cells (1Denker B.M. Smith B.L. Kuhajda F.P. Agre P. J. Biol.

AQP5, recently cloned from rat submandibular glands, is present in the water transporting epithelia of lacrimal glands, trachea, eye, lung, and salivary glands (4Raina S. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1908-1912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Topographically, it has been localized to the apical membranes in salivary and lacrimal glands (5Agre P. Brown D. Nielsen S. Curr. Opin. Cell.

(1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 19457-19463). To investigate which of two PSA synthase (ST8Sia II and IV) are involved in the biosynthesis of PSA associated with NCAM, the expressions of PSA, PSA synthase activity, and the genes of two PSA synthases during in vitro neuronal differentiation of mouse embryonal carcinoma P19 cells were determined. PSA was not expressed on undifferentiated cells (day 0) or cell aggregates (days 1-3) induced with retinoic acid. Expression of PSA began after cell aggregates had been dissociated and re-plated on a dish (day 4) and increased up to day 7. The expression of the mouse ST8Sia II gene was negligible in both undifferentiated and aggregated cells, it beginning at day 4, then dramatically increasing, and reaching the maximum level at days 6-7. On the other hand, transcription of the ST8Sia IV gene remained at a very low level throughout the entire period, a significant increase in its expression during differentiation not being observed. PSA synthase activity was not detected in undifferentiated or aggregated P19 cells, it increasing in parallel with ST8Sia II gene expression during differentiation. In addition, the cells at day 7 were stained with an anti-mouse ST8Sia II antiserum. Similar up-regulation of the ST8Sia II gene were observed during the differentiation of rat MNS-8 cells, which were derived from E-12 rat neuroepithelium of the neural tube and shown to differentiate into neurons. These results indicate that ST8Sia II predominantly directs PSA expression during neuronal differentiation rather than ST8Sia IV.

https://openalex.org/W2084844874,"The GAP-43 promoter region contains seven E-boxes (E1 to E7) that are organized in two clusters, a distal cluster (E3 to E7) and a proximal cluster (E1 and E2). Deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of the GAP-43 promoter region showed that only the most proximal E1 E-box significantly modulates GAP-43 promoter activity. This E-box is conserved between the rat and human GAP-43 promoter sequences in terms of flanking sequence, core sequence (CAGTTG), and position. We found that endogenous E-box-binding proteins present in neuronal N18 cells recognize the E1 E-box and activate the GAP-43 promoter. The transcriptional activity of the GAP-43 promoter was repressed not only by the negative regulator Id2 protein, but also by two class A basic helix-loop-helix proteins, E12 and ME1a. In vitro analyses showed that both ME1a and E12 bind to the E1 E-box as homodimers. By Northern analyses, we established an inverse correlation between the level of E12 and ME1a mRNAs and GAP-43 mRNA in various neuronal cell lines as well as in ME1a-overexpressing PC12 cells. Therefore, we have identified a cis-acting element, the E1 E-box, located in the GAP-43 promoter region that modulates either positively or negatively the expression of the GAP-43 gene depending on which E-box-binding proteins occupy this site. Together, these data indicate that basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors regulate the expression of the GAP-43 gene and that the class A ME1a and E12 proteins act as down-regulators of GAP-43 expression.

Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms governing the development and differentiation of neural cells has been greatly expanded by the study of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviations used are: bHLHbasic helix-loop-helixbpbase pair(s)CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseNGFnerve growth factorEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay. transcription factors (1Jan Y.N.

In Drosophila, the proneuronal bHLH genes achaete-scute and daughterless are involved in the determination of cells to become neuronal precursors (4Campos-Ortega J.A. Jan Y.N. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 399-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The daughterless mutants are characterized by an abnormal cell pattern in the central nervous system and by the absence of neurons in the peripheral nervous system (5Caudy M. Vassin H. Brand M. Tuma R. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1988; 55: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The proneural gene atonal also encodes a bHLH transcription factor that is essential for the commitment of the mother cells of internal sensory (chodortonal) organs and the ommatidia of the compound eye (6Jarman A.P. Grau Y. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1993; 73: 1307-1321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The rat homologue of Drosophila achaete-scute, mash-1, is expressed in the developing nervous system during neurogenesis and is essential for the generation of the olfactory system and the autonomic nervous system (7Johnson J.E.

It is transiently expressed in postmitotic differentiating neurons during mouse embryonic development and triggers premature neuronal differentiation when ectopically expressed. basic helix-loop-helix base pair(s) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase nerve growth factor electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Accumulating evidence suggests that tissue-specific genes are likely candidates for timely regulation by bHLH transcription factors. Upon differentiation, postmitotic neuroblasts express the GAP-43 gene at high levels in their growth cones during axonal growth and synapse formation (10Basi G.S. Jacobson R.D. Virag I. Schilling J. Skene J.H.P. Cell. 1987; 49: 785-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 11de la Monte S. Federoff H. Ng S.-C. Grabczyk E. Fishman M. Dev.

While the potential functions of GAP-43 have been extensively investigated, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the spatial and temporal expression of GAP-43 are still poorly understood. As brain development proceeds, the pattern of GAP-43 expression becomes progressively more restricted to areas of the brain associated with synaptic plasticity such as the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. In addition, GAP-43 expression augments during regeneration of peripheral nerves and certain types of central nervous system injury (13Chong M.S. Fitzgerald M. Winter J. Hu-Tasi M. Emson P.C.

Neuroscience. 1992; 45: 213-220Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that GAP-43 may play a role in axonal outgrowth or growth cone formation by interacting with the transduction machinery responsive to extracellular as well as intracellular signals (15Aigner L. Caroni P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 16Strittmatter S.M. Valenzuela D. Fishman M.C. J.

Fishman M.C. Science. 1989; 244: 1193-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated by gene targeting that GAP-43 is involved in axonal pathfinding at the optic chiasma during perinatal development (19Strittmatter S.M. Fankhauser C. Huang P.L. Mashimo H. Fishman M.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 445-452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of GAP-43 regulation remains unclear, recent studies suggest that the most likely mechanism of regulation might occur at the level of transcription initiation, although the GAP-43 mRNA stability may also be affected (10Basi G.S. Jacobson R.D. Virag I. Schilling J. Skene J.H.P. Cell. 1987; 49: 785-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 20Federoff H.J. Grabczyk E. Fishman M.C. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As a step toward the elucidation of GAP-43 regulation, the rat and human GAP-43 promoter regions have been sequenced and characterized (22Grabczyk E. Zuber M.X. Federoff H.J. Ng S.-C. Puck A. Fishman M.C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1990; 2: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Örtoft E. Pahlman S. Andersson G. Parrow V. Betsholtz C. Hammerling U. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1993; 4: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recently, two distinct promoter regions in the 5′-regulatory region of GAP-43 have been mapped, P1 (located between -750 and -407) and P2 (located within the -233 bp from the translational start codon), which is activated during neuronal differentiation of P19-EC cells and in 8-day-old rat brain (24Eggen B.J.L. Nielander H.B. Rensen-de Leeuw M.G.A. Schotman P. Gispen W.H. Schrama L.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 23: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it seems that the ratio of P1 and P2 promoter activity varies during neuronal differentiation and at different developmental stages of neurogenesis. Therefore, regulatory elements must exist in these two promoter regions to modulate their activities during neurogenesis. Our objective has been to determine whether there is any cis-acting element responsible for the neuron-specific expression of GAP-43. No classical regulatory elements involved in transcriptional regulation, such as TATA and CAAT boxes and SP1-binding sites, were detected in the P2 350-bp promoter region (22Grabczyk E. Zuber M.X. Federoff H.J. Ng S.-C. Puck A. Fishman M.C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1990; 2: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Potential consensus binding sites for AP1, AP2, Myb, and NF-IL6 have been found in the GAP-43 promoter region (24Eggen B.J.L. Nielander H.B. Rensen-de Leeuw M.G.A. Schotman P. Gispen W.H. Schrama L.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 23: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, none of these putative responsive elements are core-binding sites for proteins that are cell type-specific and developmentally regulated. Upon examination of the rat gap-43 5′-regulatory region, seven putative cis-acting enhancer E-boxes were found spanning the two promoter regions P1 and P2. These E-box elements, characterized by a core DNA sequence (CANNTG), are binding sites for bHLH transcription factors that are responsible for tissue-specific transcription (25Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Baltimore D.

Cell. 1991; 66: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The bHLH transcription factors are characterized by a conserved basic helix-loop-helix structural motif and bind DNA as dimers to modulate transcription of target genes. The bHLH proteins have been classified into distinct classes based on their structure and pattern of expression (reviewed by Murre et al. (27Murre C. Bain G. van Dijk M.A. Engel I. Furnari B.A. Massari M.E. Matthews J.R. Quong M.W. Rivera R.R. Stuiver M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar)). HLH proteins like Id1, Id2, and Emc lack the basic domain and function as dominant-negative HLH proteins to form nonfunctional heterodimers with bHLH proteins (28Benezra R. Davis D.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar, 29Ellis H.M. Spann D.R. Posakony J.W. Cell. 1990; 61: 27-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 30Sun X.-H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5603-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In this study, we addressed the question whether bHLH proteins are involved in the regulation of GAP-43 expression. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of GAP-43 expression, we examined the transcriptional activity of the seven putative E-boxes by deletion analysis. We demonstrated that the first proximal E1 E-box is crucial to the modulation of GAP-43 promoter activity. The fact that this E-box is conserved in terms of position and sequence between the rat and human GAP-43 promoter regions strengthens the idea of its potential role to control the specific spatial and temporal expressions of GAP-43 during brain development. We found that the E1 E-box has a dual function in the regulation of GAP-43, depending on which bHLH proteins recognize this site. The E1 E-box has the potential to either enhance or silence GAP-43 promoter activity. We identified two class A bHLH proteins, E12 and ME1a, that suppress GAP-43 promoter activity, indicating that class A bHLH proteins have the ability to function as either positive or negative regulators of transcription. In vivo, we observed a correlation between the level of endogenous GAP-43 expression and the bHLH proteins E12 and ME1a in various neuronal cell lines. The eukaryotic expression plasmids pRcCMV/ME1a and pRcCMV/Id2 were as described previously (31Chiaramello A. Soosaar A. Neuman T. Zuber M.X. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 29: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic expression plasmid pRcCMV/E12 was a gift from H. Weintraub. All GAP-43-CAT constructs (GHC, GXC, GAC, and GNC) were derivatives of the promoterless CAT plasmid pSP64/CAT. The GHC plasmid contains 1 kilobase pair of rat gap-43 promoter sequence with the three major transcription start sites as well as the seven E-boxes (E1 to E7). The 5′-deletions of the rat gap-43 promoter region were created from the GHC plasmid using various restriction enzymes. The GNC construct was obtained by NheI digestion and does not carry any E-box. The GAC construct was obtained by digesting the GHC plasmid with the AccI enzyme and carries the first proximal E1 E-box. The GXC construct was obtained by XbaI digestion and contains the first two proximal E-boxes (E1 and E2). The HindIII-XbaI fragment containing the last four E-boxes (E4 to E7) was subcloned into pmintkCAT (32Kretzner L. Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Nature. 1992; 359: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and is referred as the G4minCAT reporter plasmid. The first two E-boxes (E1 and E2) were subcloned into the XbaI and BamHI sites of the pminCAT vector by polymerase chain reaction using two primers producing two different termini, XbaI and BamHI, and the Taq polymerase enzyme (Life Technologies, Inc.). The sequence of each primer is as follows, with the incorporated restriction enzyme site underlined: XbaI primer, 5′-CCGTCTAGAGAGAAATGCATATGC-3′; and BamHI primer, 5′-GGTGGATCCTCTTCCTCACACACA-3′. Site-directed mutagenesis within the rat gap-43 promoter was performed by the method of Deng and Nickoloff (33Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar), using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). Briefly, this method uses two primers, one that carries a mutation in the E1 or E2 E-box (mutagenic primer) and one that carries a mutation in the SmaI site unique to the GXC or GHC plasmid that was converted into AvrII for selection purpose (selection primer). The sequence of each primer is as follows, with the incorporated mutation underlined: E1 mutagenic primer, 5′-CGCTGTAGACCTTATAGTTCCTGCTAACTGCCC-3′; E2 mutagenic primer, 5′-GAGAAATGTATATCCGGTGAGC; and selection primer, 5′-GAGAACGGGACCTAGGCAGAAAG3′. These oligonucleotides were synthesized at the Macromolecular Resource Center at Colorado State University and annealed to the denatured double-stranded GHC or GXC plasmid. Synthesis of the second strand was carried out using T4 DNA polymerase. To lower considerably the proportion of parental plasmid, a SmaI digestion was done before transforming the Escherichia coli mutS strain. All mutant clones (GXC/E1m, GXC/E2m, GHC/E1m, and GHC/E2m) were selected by cutting with the AvrII restriction enzyme and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The N18 neuroblastoma cell line (34Amano T. Richelson E. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), the NG108 neuroblastoma × glioma cell line (38Chiaramello A. Neuman K. Palm K. Metsis M. Neuman T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6036-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the HTF4 neuronal cell line (35Hamprecht B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1977; 49: 99-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). PC12 cells (a gift from L. Greene) were maintained and differentiated with NGF as described (37Green L.A. Tischner A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4762) Google Scholar). Rat glioblastoma C6 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. ME1a cDNA in the pRcCMV expression vector (Invitrogen) was transfected into PC12 cells, followed by selection with G418 (400 mg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) for 18-21 days to establish ME1a-overexpressing cell lines as described previously (38Chiaramello A. Neuman K. Palm K. Metsis M. Neuman T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6036-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The control PC12 cells were transfected with the parental pRcCMV expression vector and then selected for G418 resistance. N18 cells at a density of 0.5-1 × 106 in 60-mm dishes were transfected using a calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. If not indicated otherwise, 2 µg of reporter-promoter plasmid and 8 µg of eukaryotic expression plasmid were used for each transfection. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by the addition of an appropriate amount of carrier DNA (parental expression vector pRcCMV). Twenty-four hours later, the medium was changed, and cells were harvested after 48 h. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 250 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) by three freeze/thaw cycles. Then, CAT assays were performed as described (31Chiaramello A. Soosaar A. Neuman T. Zuber M.X. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 29: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the percent acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol was determined by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Nuclear extracts from N18 cells were prepared essentially as described (39Dynan W.S. Genet. Eng. 1987; 9: 75-87Crossref Google Scholar). All steps were performed at 4°C in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, benzamidine, aprotinin, and leupeptin). Confluent cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice and resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol), and the nuclei were isolated with 10 stokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Then, the nuclei were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 420 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 10% sucrose. The nuclear lysate was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was precipitated with 0.33 g/ml ammonium sulfate and then dialyzed against 0.1 M buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol. Aliquots of the nuclear extracts were stored at -80°C. The sequences of the top strands of oligonucleotides (Macromolecular Resource Center at Colorado State University) used as probes or competitors in EMSA analysis were as follows: wild-type E1 E-box, 5′-TAGACCTTACAGTTGCTGCTAACTGCCCTG-3′; and mutated E1 E-box, 5′-TAGACCTTATAGTTCCTGCTAACTGCCCTG-3′. The wild-type E-box sequence is underlined, and the mutated E-box sequence is in boldface. The complementary strand of each oligonucleotide was annealed, and the double-stranded probe (wild-type E1) was labeled by kinase treatment using [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) and T4 kinase (Boehringer Mannheim). Unlabeled competitor DNA (mutated E1) was prepared by annealing complementary oligonucleotides. DNA binding reactions consisted of 10 µg of N18 nuclear extracts incubated with 40 fmol of labeled oligonucleotide E1 and 800 ng of poly(dI·dC) (Sigma) for 20 min at room temperature in the presence of binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM MgCl2, and 5% glycerol). For competition experiments, the nuclear extracts were incubated with the E1 probe in the presence of various amounts of excess unlabeled specific (E1) and nonspecific (mutated E1) competitors. To test the effect of Id2 on the specific DNA-protein complex, increasing amounts of Id2 were added to the binding reactions. Recombinant ME1a protein was purified by nickel affinity chromatography (31Chiaramello A. Soosaar A. Neuman T. Zuber M.X. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 29: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and E12 protein was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. DNA binding reactions consisted of 60 ng of either ME1a or E12 protein incubated with 40 fmol of labeled specific oligonucleotides and 100 ng of poly(dI·dC). For competition experiments, a 100-fold excess of specific (E1) and nonspecific (mutated E1) competitors was added to the binding reaction. The products of the DNA binding reactions were separated on a 5% native gel containing 0.5 × Tris/boric acid/EDTA (45 mM Tris, 45 mM boric acid, and 1 mM EDTA). Gels were dried and exposed on Hyperfilm MP x-ray film (Amersham Corp.) at -70°C. Total RNA was isolated using the acid guanidinium/phenol/chloroform extraction procedure (40Chomczynski S. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62714) Google Scholar). Twenty-five micrograms of total RNA were run in each lane and fractionated on a 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel before transfer onto a nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham Corp.). The amount and quality of transferred RNA were monitored either by methylene blue staining of the filters before hybridization or by using an internal control, the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA. The SpeI-BamHI fragment from ME1a cDNA, the full-length E12 cDNA, the full-length GAPDH cDNA, and the HindIII-PstI fragment from rat gap-43 cDNA were isolated, radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP using the Multiprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Corp.), and used as probes. The blots were washed at high stringency (0.2 × SSC, 65°C) and exposed to x-ray film for 1-10 days. Upon analysis of the 1-kilobase pair rat gap-43 promoter region, we detected seven putative E-boxes, which are binding sites for the developmentally regulated and cell type-specific bHLH transcription factors (Fig. 1A). These E-boxes were designated E1 to E7 according to the order of the distance from the translation start site of GAP-43. The E-boxes E3 to E7, located in the P1 promoter region (-705 to -407), are not conserved between rat and human GAP-43 promoter sequences, whereas the E1 and E2 E-boxes, clustered in the P2 promoter region (-233 to -1), are conserved between rat and human GAP-43 sequences. However, only the first E-box E1 is perfectly conserved in terms of position, core sequence (CAGTTG), and flanking sequences (23Örtoft E. Pahlman S. Andersson G. Parrow V. Betsholtz C. Hammerling U. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1993; 4: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), suggesting that this regulatory element has a critical function. To investigate the activity of these E-boxes, we first constructed several GAP-43 5′-deletion mutants that were fused to the promoterless bacterial CAT reporter gene (Fig. 1B). The GNC construct represents a negative control that does not contain any E-box element, but has the three major transcription start sites as defined by Grabczyk et al. (22Grabczyk E. Zuber M.X. Federoff H.J. Ng S.-C. Puck A. Fishman M.C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1990; 2: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The GAC construct carries a single E-box, the E1 E-box, whereas the GXC construct contains the two clustered E-boxes, E1 and E2. The GHC construct represents the wild-type GAP-43 promoter region (1 kilobase pair) with the seven E-boxes. In all of these constructs, the expression of the CAT gene is driven by the GAP-43 promoter. We examined the transcriptional activity of the various GAP-43 reporter-promoter plasmids by transient CAT assays using the N18 neuroblastoma cell line. This cell line was chosen based on the Northern analysis results, which indicate high expression of endogenous GAP-43 (see Fig. 7). As shown in Fig. 2, the 90-bp fragment containing the E1 E-box was sufficient to induce maximal activation of the GAP-43 promoter (6.4-fold), whereas only basal promoter activity was observed with the GNC construct, which does not contain any E-box. In contrast, the GXC construct, which carries an extra E-box (E2) compared with the GAC construct, did not display stronger transcriptional activity compared with GAC plasmid (6.8-fold). In addition, the transcriptional activity observed with both the GAC and GXC constructs was similar to the activity of the full-length GAP-43 promoter construct GHC. These data suggest that the E1 E-box, located in the P2 promoter region, is a functionally important regulatory cis-acting element for GAP-43 expression. Furthermore, the six distal E-boxes do not seem to contribute to GAP-43 promoter activity. To further characterize these E-box elements, we cloned the two clusters of E-boxes, the proximal E1-E2 cluster and the distal E4-E7 cluster, upstream of the minimal herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk) promoter (G2minCAT and G4minCAT, respectively). Transient CAT assays were performed in N18 neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 3). Only the G2minCAT construct showed transcriptional activity above background levels, with a 5.4 fold-increase, which is comparable to the activity obtained using the homologous reporter-promoter construct GXC. In contrast, the G4minCAT construct did not display any transcriptional activity, which is in agreement with the transcriptional data obtained by 5′-deletion analysis of the GAP-43 promoter region. Taken together, these data imply that the E1 E-box element may be sufficient to modulate the transcriptional activity of both the GAP-43 promoter and the heterologous tk promoter. To determine whether the E1 E-box is critical to GAP-43 promoter activity, we introduced mutations into the E1 or E2 E-box of either the GXC or GHC plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1C). The GXC reporter-promoter plasmid, in which the E1 E-box sequence (CAGTTG) was replaced by a mutated E-box sequence (TAGTTC), showed a 18-fold reduction in transcriptional activity (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6) compared with the wild-type reporter-promoter plasmid GXC (lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, the transcriptional activity of another mutant construct, GXC/E2m, in which the E2 E-box sequence (CATATG) was replaced by a mutated E-box sequence (TATATC), was similar to that of the wild-type reporter-promoter construct GXC (Fig. 4, lanes 1-4). Similar results were obtained when either the E1 or E2 E-box sequence was mutated in another wild-type reporter-promoter plasmid, called GHC (data not shown). These data offer additional support to the conclusion that the E1 E-box functions as a crucial element for GAP-43 promoter activity. To examine the binding activity of endogenous E-box-binding proteins that interact with the E1 E-box, we performed EMSA using nuclear proteins isolated from N18 neuroblastoma cells and an oligonucleotide containing the E1 E-box sequence. Incubation of the E1 E-box probe with N18 nuclear extracts produced a major retarded band (Fig. 5, lane 2). This shifted band was competed with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled specific oligonucleotide (Fig. 5, lane 5). When an excess of unlabeled competitor containing a mutation in the E1 E-box sequence (nonspecific competitor) was added to the binding reaction, no competition was observed (Fig. 5, lanes 7-10). Therefore, the complex formed between the E1 E-box and the endogenous E-box-binding proteins is specific. These findings further strengthen the transcriptional data obtained from the transient CAT assay. To examine whether GAP-43 promoter activity would be repressed by the negative transcriptional regulator Id-like proteins, we overexpressed Id2 in N18 neuroblastoma cells and performed CAT assays. As Id2 protein lacks the DNA-binding basic region, it forms nonfunctional heterodimers and consequently negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of some E-box-binding proteins. Fig. 3 shows that Id2 significantly reduced the transcriptional activity of the G2minCAT reporter plasmid, which contains the clustered E1 and E2 E-boxes. In contrast, the last four E-boxes from the G4minCAT construct were not affected by Id2 (Fig. 3). We therefore tested whether the E1 E-box was also a target for Id2 repression in the native context of the GAP-43 promoter by cotransfecting N18 cells with the GAC reporter plasmid and the eukaryotic expression plasmid pRcCMV/Id2. Overexpression of the negative regulator Id2 resulted in a dec"

During the course of HSSB purification from HeLa cell extracts, we observed that a number of preparations contained an ~18-kDa protein (relative mobility observed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels) present in stoichiometric amounts with respect to the HSSB polypeptides (p70, p34, and p14). Peptide sequencing of this 18-kDa protein revealed that it is identical to the transcription positive cofactor 4 (PC4; also called p9 precursor), a protein of 127 amino acid residues (15Ge H.

Biol. 1994; 12: 3993-4001Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and their ability to simultaneously interact with ssDNA was examined utilizing a gel retardation assay as shown in Fig. 1. Incubation of increasing amounts of PC4 with a 32P-labeled ssDNA substrate (45 nt), resulted in a heterogenous population of DNA complexes with reduced mobility following electrophoresis through polyacrylamide gels (lanes 2 and 3). The mobility of these retarded DNA bands was further reduced following addition of antibodies against PC4 (lane 5), but not HSSB (lane 4), confirming the presence of PC4 in these complexes. The size heterogeneity of the PC4·ssDNA complex was most likely due to the association of the ssDNA fragment with variable amounts of PC4. Incubation of HSSB with the DNA substrate resulted in the formation of a single retarded band (lane 6), the mobility of which was further reduced following addition of monoclonal antibodies recognizing the p34 subunit of HSSB (lane 7), confirming the presence of HSSB in this complex. Co-incubation of HSSB and PC4 with the ssDNA fragment yielded complexes that migrated more slowly than either the HSSB·DNA or PC4·DNA complexes (lanes 9 and 10). HSSB and PC4 were both present in these DNA-protein complexes, since the migration of these complexes was retarded by the addition of antibodies recognizing either HSSB or PC4 (lanes 11 and 12). Thus HSSB and PC4 were capable of simultaneously interacting with ssDNA. In the presence of ATP, HSSB supports T antigen-dependent unwinding of duplex DNA containing SV40 ori+. We examined whether PC4, a nonreplicative ssDNA-binding protein, was capable of substituting for HSSB in SV40 ori+ DNA unwinding (Fig. 2A). This assay measured the production of unwound ssDNA from a 32P-labeled duplex ori+ DNA fragment in the presence of T antigen, ATP, and either HSSB (lanes 3-7) or PC4 (lanes 8-12). Quantitation of the results (Fig. 2B) demonstrated that PC4 supported the T antigen-dependent unwinding reaction to a similar extent as HSSB. In the SV40 replication system, RNA primers on both leading and lagging strands are synthesized by the pol α-primase complex in the presence of ori+ DNA, HSSB, and topo I. No other SSB can substitute for HSSB in this reaction (8Matsumoto T. Eki T. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9712-9716Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We tested whether PC4, which was capable of forming PC4·HSSB·ssDNA complexes and supporting T antigen-catalyzed unwinding, was able to interfere with RNA primer synthesis. As shown in Fig. 3, the synthesis of oligoribonucleotides in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (10-16 nt in length) was dependent upon the addition of T antigen and HSSB, since omission of either of these from the reaction resulted in no primer synthesis (lanes 1 and 6). PC4 could not substitute for HSSB in this reaction (lane 7) and when added in the presence of HSSB, markedly inhibited RNA primer synthesis (lane 8). This inhibition was reversed partially by the addition of excess HSSB (lanes 9-11), suggesting that PC4 inhibited this reaction by competing with HSSB. In addition to its role in initiation, HSSB is required for processive DNA synthesis during the elongation stage of SV40 DNA replication, which is catalyzed by the pol δ holoenzyme. To assess the influence of PC4 on the HSSB-dependent pol δ-catalyzed reaction, a singly primed φX174 sscDNA elongation assay was carried out (Fig. 4). In this reaction, template DNA was incubated with the pol δ holoenzyme (pol δ, PCNA, and RFC) and HSSB in the presence of dNTPs, resulting in the incorporation of [32P]dCMP into full-length DNA (lanes 2-4). In the absence of HSSB (lane 1) or PCNA (lane 5), little DNA synthesis was detected. PC4 did not substitute for HSSB in the elongation reaction (lane 6). The addition of PC4 inhibited this elongation reaction (lane 7). However, in the presence of excess HSSB, the PC4-dependent inhibition was markedly decreased (lanes 8 and 9), suggesting that PC4 abolished DNA elongation activity by specifically inhibiting the function of HSSB. SV40 DNA replication can be assayed using both the mono- and dipolymerase systems (12Eki T. Matsumoto T. Murakami Y. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7284-7294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The monopolymerase system requires ori+ DNA, HSSB, topo I, and relatively high levels of the pol α-primase complex which catalyzes both leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis in the presence of dNTPs. In this system replication products derived from lagging strand DNA synthesis can be readily separated from those of the leading strand by alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis. In complete reactions containing HSSB at 3.8 or 19 µg/ml (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 6), two discrete products were observed, centered at ~75 nt (lagging strand) and ~1,600 nt (leading strand). When HSSB was added at high levels (89 and 260 µg/ml), the reaction was inhibited (lanes 7 and 8). This inhibition resulted from decreased RNA primer synthesis and leading strand DNA elongation in the presence of high levels of HSSB, as reported previously (Refs. 12Eki T. Matsumoto T. Murakami Y. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7284-7294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 24Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1961-1968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; also see Fig. 3). The reasons for this effect are presently unknown; however, it is conceivable that excess HSSB may “squelch” T antigen or/and the pol α-primase complex resulting in the formation of inactive complexes. The influence of PC4 on the monopolymerase system was dependent upon the concentration of HSSB. In the presence of 3.8 µg/ml of HSSB, the addition of a low level of PC4 (0.8 µg/ml) resulted in a 35% stimulation of leading strand DNA synthesis (lane 3) (as quantitated by phosphorimager analyses). Although the level of Okazaki fragment synthesis (100-500 nt) remained unchanged, the size of lagging strands was markedly increased. In contrast, the addition of higher levels of PC4 inhibited both lagging and leading strand DNA synthesis (lanes 4 and 5). This inhibition may result from the ability of PC4 to inhibit primase activity as demonstrated in Fig. 3. Thus, low levels of PC4, which partially inhibit RNA primer synthesis, probably result in an increase in the distance between RNA primers on the lagging strand. Elongation of these RNA primers by pol α results in longer DNA products as shown in lane 3. The presence of higher levels of PC4 completely inhibited primase activity and thus no replication ensued. In the presence of high levels of HSSB (89 and 260 µg/ml), replication was inhibited (lanes 7 and 8), and the addition of PC4 (4 µg/ml) markedly stimulated the reaction (lanes 10 and 11). Quantitation of these results by phosphorimager analyses indicated that in the presence of 89 µg/ml of HSSB, the addition of PC4 (4 µg/ml) increased leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis by 2.8- and 1.9-fold, respectively (compare lanes 7 and 10). In the presence of 260 µg/ml HSSB, the addition of the PC4 (4 µg/ml) increased leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis by 4.5- and 3.3-fold, respectively (compare lanes 8 and 11). These observations demonstrated that PC4 was able to (i) overcome the inhibitory effects of high levels of HSSB in the monopolymerase system, (ii) activate replication to levels higher than those observed with low (“optimal”) concentrations of HSSB, and (iii) the PC4-mediated stimulatory effects were more pronounced as the concentration of HSSB was increased (compare lane 4 with lanes 9-11). Processive leading strand DNA synthesis and maturation of Okazaki fragments during SV40 replication are catalyzed by the pol δ holoenzyme. The dipolymerase system contains ori+ DNA, low levels of the pol α-primase complex, HSSB, topo I, and the pol δ holoenzyme in the presence of dNTPs. Fig. 6 shows the influence of PC4 on the dipolymerase replication reaction. Products labeled with [32P]dCMP that formed in the replication reaction were analyzed by alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis. In the absence of the pol δ holoenzyme, only small Okazaki fragments (~75 nt long) were formed due to the action of limiting amounts of the pol α-primase complex (lane 1). Addition of increasing amounts of HSSB inhibited this reaction (lanes 2 and 3), consistent with previous observations (Fig. 5). In the presence of the pol δ holoenzyme, a heterogeneous population of products (150-3,000 nt) was synthesized (lane 4). This reaction required PCNA (lane 5), T antigen (lane 6), and HSSB (lane 16). High levels of HSSB (138 µg/ml) virtually abolished the dipolymerase replication reaction (lane 8). As observed in the monopolymerase system, the influence of PC4 on the dipolymerase reaction was dependent upon the amount of HSSB added. In the presence of a low level of HSSB (10 µg/ml), the addition of a low level of PC4 (1.9 µg/ml) slightly stimulated the replication reaction (compare lanes 4 and 9). Under these conditions, the synthesis of both long (1,018-3,054 nt) and short DNA products (344-1,018 nt) increased 62 and 49%, respectively (quantitated by phosphorimager analyses). In the presence of high levels of PC4 (4 µg/ml), replication was inhibited 70% (compare lanes 4 and 12). In reactions containing higher concentrations of HSSB (25 µg/ml), replication was slightly stimulated by the addition of a low level of PC4 (1.9 µg/ml) (compare lanes 7 and 10). At this concentration of HSSB, the addition of a high level of PC4 (4 µg/ml) reduced replication by 10% (lane 13). In the presence of a very high level of HSSB (138 µg/ml), replication was nearly abolished (lane 8), but the addition of increasing amounts of PC4 (to 1.9 and 4 µg/ml) reversed this inhibition (lanes 11 and 14) in a PCNA-dependent reaction (lane 15). This indicates that the extensive DNA synthesis observed in the presence of PC4 (lane 14) was catalyzed by the pol δ holoenzyme. The in vitro replication of SV40 DNA can be regulated by a variety of proteins that either directly target T antigen, such as cyclin-dependent cdc2 kinase (25McVey D. Brizuela L. Mohr I. Marshaqk D.R. Gluzman Y. Beach D. Nature. 1989; 341: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), phosphatase 2A (26Virshup D.M. Kauffman M.G. Kelly T.J.

Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). These studies have contributed to our understanding of the cellular controls governing DNA replication. The data presented in this report demonstrated that PC4, a ssDNA binding protein that functions as a transcription co-activator, can influence several activities associated with HSSB that are required for replication (see Table I for a summary). Depending on the concentration of HSSB used, PC4 can either inhibit or activate SV40 DNA replication as assayed in both the mono- and dipolymerase systems.TABLE ISummary of effects of PC4 on activities intrinsic to HSSB that are required for replicationHSSB activityInfluence of PC4ssDNA bindingFormed HSSB·PC4·ssDNA complexesUnwinding of SV40 ori by T antigenReplaced HSSB for this activityRNA primer synthesisInhibitionDNA elongation by pol δInhibitionSV40 DNA replicationLow HSSB (4-10 µg/ml)InhibitionHigh HSSB (80-260 µg/ml)Activation Open table in a new tab The binding of a replication initiator protein, such as T antigen, to its origin results in localized melting of duplex DNA (4Borowiec J.A. Dean F.B. Bullock P. Hurwitz J. Cell. 1990; 60: 181-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The resulting ssDNA region must be stabilized by a ssDNA-binding protein in order for T antigen, a replicative helicase, to further catalyze bidirectional unwinding. Various prokaryotic and virus-encoded replicative ssDNA-binding proteins are capable of supporting this unwinding reaction in place of HSSB (reviewed in Ref. 4Borowiec J.A. Dean F.B. Bullock P. Hurwitz J. Cell. 1990; 60: 181-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). However, subsequent RNA primer synthesis, catalyzed by the pol α-primase complex, can only occur in the presence of HSSB (8Matsumoto T. Eki T. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9712-9716Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, binding of nonreplicative ssDNA-binding proteins such as PC4, to unwound ssDNA regions, may have profound effects on the initiation of chromosomal DNA replication. Based on studies presented in this report we propose a working model (Fig. 7) to explain the effect of PC4 on the initiation of SV40 DNA replication. In the presence of limiting concentrations of HSSB, T antigen unwinds DNA at the origin and then assembles a preinitiation complex with HSSB and pol α-primase due to its direct interaction with these proteins (5Dornreiter I. Hüss A. Arthur A.K. Fanning E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3329-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 6Dornreiter I. Erdile L.F. Gilbert I.U. von Winkler D. Kelly T.J. Fanning E. EMBO J. 1990; 11: 769-776Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 7Collins K.L. Russo A.A.R. Tseng B.Y. Kelly T.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4555-4566Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), resulting in the synthesis of RNA primers (A). Excess HSSB inhibits initiation presumably by “squelching” T antigen (B, diagram a) and/or pol α-primase (B, diagram b), respectively. PC4 supports T antigen-catalyzed unwinding in place of HSSB (see Fig. 2) and may increase the percentage of duplex DNA molecules unwound around the SV40 origin (illustrated as two origins opened in C as opposed to one origin opened in Fig. 7A). However, in the presence of low levels of HSSB, this effect may decrease the amount and availability of HSSB in the vicinity of T antigen and reduce the loading of the pol α-primase complex at the origin. In contrast, when high levels of HSSB are present, the PC4-mediated increase of unwound ssDNA regions may contribute to the efficient binding of HSSB (Fig. 7D). As a result, the HSSB-mediated “squelching” of T antigen and the pol α-primase complex is markedly reduced favoring the formation of active preinitiation complexes. Under these conditions, high concentrations of HSSB suppress the inhibitory effects of PC4 on RNA primer synthesis and pol δ-catalyzed DNA elongation (see Fig. 3, Fig. 4). These combined actions may account for the highly efficient DNA replication observed. As shown in Fig. 1, PC4 was capable of forming complexes with HSSB on a single-stranded DNA fragment. The direct association between HSSB and PC4 was not detected by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown). However, it is possible that HSSB at high concentrations transiently interacts with PC4, preventing the HSSB-mediated squelching of both T antigen and the pol α-primase complex. We thank Dr. M. Ishiai for providing DNA substrates for the ssDNA binding and T antigen unwinding experiments and E. Gibbs for critical reading of this manuscript."

They are derived from glucosylceramides (GlcCer) upon their extrusion from lamellar granules into the extracellular space in the upper layers of the epidermis. To better understand the regulation of the unique pathway for ceramide production in epidermis, we have studied the activity of the enzyme responsible for GlcCer synthesis, ceramide glucosyltransferase (CerGlc transferase), during keratinocyte culture differentiation. Human keratinocyte cultures were expanded in low calcium keratinocyte growth medium (KGM) and then switched to either normal calcium KGM (nKGM) or “complete” Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (3:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (cDMEM). At 7 and 10 days after the medium switch, electron microscopy revealed that cDMEM cultures were more fully differentiated morphologically and contained numerous lamellar granules. The GlcCer/DNA content of cDMEM cultures increased to 6 times that of day 0 cultures and was nearly 4 times greater than that of nKGM cultures, whereas the total lipid/DNA content of cDMEM cultures increased to only 1.8 times that of day 0 cultures and was ~1.2 times that of nKGM cultures. CerGlc transferase activity/DNA increased 6 times in cDMEM cultures but <1.5 times in nKGM cultures. By contrast, β-glucocerebrosidase activity, which is responsible for the conversion of GlcCer to ceramide, increased to a similar extent in both differentiating culture systems. Treatment of cultures with the reversible CerGlc transferase inhibitor, DL-threo-1-phenyl-2-(palmitoylamino)-3-morpholino-1-propanol, prevented the increase of GlcCer in cDMEM cultures, and blocked conversion of exogenously added ceramide to GlcCer. A low level of CerGlc transferase activity, relative to that in differentiated keratinocytes, was detected in cultures of other human cell types. These results indicate that CerGlc transferase activity is induced during epidermal differentiation and that regulation of this enzyme may be an important determinant of the specialized production and compartmentalization of epidermal sphingolipids.

The addition of IL-1β to KL + IL-10 elicited a prolonged ~12-fold increase in the level of IL-6 mRNA by 3-5 h and an ~50-fold increase in the level of IL-6 protein released by 7 h. As determined by nuclear run-on analysis, KL + IL-10 stimulated IL-6 gene transcription within 0.5 h, and the addition of IL-1β did not increase transcription. Instead, IL-1β slowed by ~8-fold the decay of IL-6 mRNA as compared to its decay in BMMC stimulated with KL + IL-10 alone. The exposure of BMMC to cycloheximide 0.5 h before the addition of the three exogenous cytokines inhibited by ~50% the level of IL-6 mRNA generated but did not inhibit the effects of KL + IL-10, indicating that IL-1β induces the synthesis of a protein that stabilizes IL-6 mRNA. The stabilization of IL-6 mRNA was inhibited by the addition of actinomycin D at 0.5 but not 3 h after BMMC were stimulated with IL-1β in combination with KL + IL-10, suggesting that once transcribed, the stabilizing protein is long-lived. The addition of cycloheximide to BMMC after stimulation with KL + IL-10 with or without IL-1β increased the levels of steady-state IL-6 mRNA compared to levels in cells without drug, indicating that in addition to stimulating IL-6 transcription, KL + IL-10 induces a protein factor that destabilizes IL-6 mRNA. Thus, there exists a novel Fcϵ receptor type I-independent mechanism by which a mast cell can provide substantial amounts of IL-6 protein in response to the synergistic action of KL and IL-10 to induce IL-6 gene transcription, and IL-1β to stabilize otherwise short-lived IL-6 transcripts.

This cytokine stimulates the acute phase response to tissue injury or infection by inducing the release of hepatic acute phase-reactive proteins that act systemically to limit tissue damage (1Sehgal P.B.

IL-6 also supports hematopoiesis through its abilities to co-stimulate with IL-3 the proliferation of multipotent hematopoietic progenitors (5Ikebuchi K. Wong G.G. Clark S.C. Ihle J.N. Hirai Y.

Mast cells are the major source of IL-6 in tissues undergoing certain types of allergic inflammation. In biopsy specimens of nasal mucosa from individuals with allergic rhinitis, >90% of the cells that contain IL-6 are mast cells (7Bradding P. Feather I.H. Wilson S. Bardin P.G. Heusser C.H. Holgate S.T. Howarth P.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3853-3865PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, in bronchial mucosal biopsies from persons with allergic asthma, nearly 100% of the cells that contain IL-6 are mast cells (8Bradding P. Okayama Y. Howarth P.H. Church M.K. Holgate S.T. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 297-307PubMed Google Scholar). In these tissues, the expression of IL-6 was specifically associated with mast cells that express the neutral protease tryptase but not chymase or carboxypeptidase A. This protease phenotype is characteristic of mast cells located in mucosal tissues (8Bradding P. Okayama Y. Howarth P.H. Church M.K. Holgate S.T. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 297-307PubMed Google Scholar). The culture of mouse bone marrow in medium containing IL-3 results in the differentiation and growth of immature mast cells (BMMC) that produce IL-6 mRNA and protein when activated immunologically through their high affinity Fcϵ receptors (9Burd P.R. Rogers H.W. Gordon J.R. Martin C.A. Jayaraman S. Wilson S.D. Dvorak A.M. Galli S.J. Dorf M.E. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 10Kaye R.E. Fruman D.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22269-22275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with kinetics and amounts similar to IgE/antigen-mediated activation. We therefore sought a non-IgE-dependent, cytokine-mediated combination for IL-6 expression. We now describe the induction of expression of the IL-6 gene in BMMC by a particular combination of cytokines: c-kit ligand (KL), IL-10, and IL-1β. Whereas the combination of KL + IL-10 is sufficient to elicit transcription of the IL-6 gene, the resulting mRNA is unstable because of a destabilizing protein and produces little IL-6 protein. The introduction of IL-1β, either simultaneously or within 3 h of the addition of KL + IL-10, markedly increases the IL-6 mRNA level and the attendant IL-6 protein production. The ability of KL + IL-10 to stimulate IL-6 gene transcription and the capacity of IL-1β to induce a protein that stabilizes IL-6 mRNA together reveal a basis for the synergistic action of these three cytokines in directly eliciting production of the multifunctional cytokine, IL-6, from mouse mast cells. Mouse recombinant IL-1β, IL-4, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 (Endogen, Cambridge, MA), nerve growth factor (NGF) (Sigma), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) were purchased. Mouse recombinant KL, IL-3, IL-9, and IL-10 were produced through expression by the infection of Sf9 insect cells with recombinant baculovirus (13Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Urade Y. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3239-3246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Bone marrow cells from male BALB/cByJ mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were cultured for 3-6 weeks in 50% enriched medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 10 µg/ml gentamicin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 10% fetal calf serum), and 50% WEHI-3 cell (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) conditioned medium. After 3 weeks, more than 95% of the cells in culture were mast cells as ascertained by metachromatic staining with toluidine blue. The BMMC were washed once with enriched medium, resuspended at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml in enriched medium supplemented with KL (50 ng/ml) + IL-10 (20 units/ml) with or without various concentrations of IL-1β, and cultured up to 48 h. These concentrations of KL and IL-10 were selected because they are within the range of concentrations that modulate the BMMC secretory granule phenotype (14Gurish M.F. Ghildyal N. McNeil H.P.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22269-22275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At various time points, the cells were centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min in a Beckman GPR centrifuge, the supernatants were collected for determination of the IL-6 protein concentrations by ELISA with the mouse IL-6 MiniKit (Endogen, Cambridge, MA), and RNA was isolated from the cell pellets. In some cases, the concentrations of IL-6 protein retained in the cell pellets and in the total reaction mixture were determined by ELISA after the samples were sonicated on ice. Total cellular RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions with QIAshredder and the RNeasy Total RNA kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). RNA blots were prepared containing a 5-µg portion of each RNA sample. The blots were sequentially hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for mouse IL-6 and 18 S ribosomal RNA and washed as described (13Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Urade Y. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3239-3246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The amount of radioactivity associated with each band was quantitated with a Betascope 603 Blot Analyzer (Betagen, Waltham, MA). The counts per minute for IL-6 mRNA were divided by the counts per minute for 18 S RNA obtained from the same lane to adjust for differences in sample loading and transfer between lanes. The fold increase in steady-state mRNA for each sample was calculated by dividing the 18 S RNA-adjusted value for cytokine-stimulated cells by that for untreated cells. To determine mRNA half-lives, actinomycin D (5 µg/ml) was added to cells at the time of peak steady-state IL-6 mRNA accumulation. RNA was isolated from samples of cells taken at several times after the addition of actinomycin D, and RNA blot analysis was performed as described above. The data were graphed as the percent of RNA remaining versus the time after the addition of actinomycin D, and the slopes of the linear portions of the decay curves were calculated by linear regression to determine the mRNA decay constants. mRNA half-lives were calculated with the formula t1/2 = ln 2/mRNA decay constant (17Belasco J.G. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 475Crossref Google Scholar). 2.5 × 107 cells were stimulated with cytokine combinations for various periods, and a nuclear run-on assay was performed as described previously (18Xia Z. Ghildyal N. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8747-8753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) except that the labeled run-on RNA products were extracted according to the protocol provided with the QIAshredder/RNeasy Total RNA kit for liquid samples. Alkaline-denatured plasmid Bluescript II KS with or without a mouse IL-6 cDNA insert and a pUC vector containing a mouse β-actin cDNA were slot-blotted at 5 µg/well onto a nylon membrane for hybridization. When BMMC, generated in 50% WEHI-3 cell-conditioned medium as a source of IL-3, were cultured for up to 48 h in either KL (50 ng/ml) + IL-10 (20 units/ml) alone or with IL-1β (5 ng/ml), steady-state IL-6 mRNA levels rapidly increased in the cells by 0.5 h, as shown on typical autoradiograms (Fig. 1, A and B) and by the 18 S RNA-adjusted data derived by Betascope analysis from multiple experiments (Fig. 1C). Steady-state IL-6 mRNA levels induced by KL + IL-10 reached a maximal 2-fold increase by 0.5 h, declined by 50% during the next 2.5 h, and returned to base-line level by 5-7 h. The addition of IL-1β to KL + IL-10 resulted in a 4-fold increase in IL-6 mRNA levels by 0.5 h and a maximal 12-fold increase 3-5 h after cytokine addition. The elevation in the steady-state IL-6 mRNA level was still ~3-fold higher than the starting level 24 h after the addition of the cytokines. The readdition of the three cytokines 3 h after their first addition to BMMC did not alter the time course or magnitude of the increase and decrease in steady-state IL-6 mRNA level. The findings with and without cytokine readdition were superimposable as assessed with Betascope analysis in three experiments (data not shown). The fact that IL-1β alone did not stimulate an increase in IL-6 mRNA levels (data not shown) indicates that IL-1β acts synergistically with KL + IL-10 to elicit the increase in IL-6 mRNA. The augmentation of the steady-state IL-6 mRNA levels by the exogenous cytokines also elicited the release of IL-6 protein by BMMC. BMMC stimulated with KL + IL-10 released ~0.2 ng/106 cells of immunoreactive IL-6 by 5-7 h (Fig. 1D). The addition of IL-1β to KL + IL-10 markedly enhanced IL-6 release, which reached a plateau value of ~9 ng/106 cells between 7 and 24 h. BMMC exposed to each of the three cytokines alone at the same concentrations produced negligible quantities of IL-6 (data not shown, n = 3). The dependence of IL-6 release on concentrations of IL-1β ranging from 0.05 to 10 ng/ml was assessed at 24 h in the presence of the fixed concentrations of KL and IL-10. A dose-related increase in IL-6 release was found that reached a plateau of 9.2 ± 1.4 ng/106 cells (mean ± S.E., n = 6) at 5 ng/ml IL-1β (data not shown). To determine if IL-6 protein was also retained by cytokine-stimulated BMMC, the amounts of IL-6 protein associated with the cell pellets, supernatants, and whole reaction mixtures were determined 24 h after stimulation of cells with either KL + IL-10 or KL + IL-10 + IL-1β. Only 1.12 ± 0.26% (mean ± S.E., n = 7) of IL-6 protein was found in the separated cell pellets as compared to supernatants, and the amount of IL-6 protein in the supernatants was 120 ± 7.3% (mean + S.E., n = 7) of that in the unseparated total reaction mixture. Thus, the amount of IL-6 released by BMMC was considered to represent the amount produced. The specificity of the synergistic effect between IL-1β and the combination of KL + IL-10 was investigated by substituting other cytokines for IL-1β in cultures containing KL + IL-10 and measuring the IL-6 protein level by ELISA. The addition of IL-3 (1,000 units/ml), IL-4 (10 ng/ml), IL-9 (1,000 units/ml), NGF (10 ng/ml), TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml), or TNF-α (10,000 units/ml) did not produce more than 3% of the level of IL-6 protein released by KL + IL-10 + IL-1β (data not shown, n = 3). BMMC were cultured either with KL + IL-10 + IL-1β (5 ng/ml) added simultaneously (no priming) or with KL + IL-10 for 0.5 or 3 h before the addition of IL-1β; the time at which IL-1β was added was designated as time 0 (Fig. 2). Priming the cells with KL + IL-10 for 0.5 h more than doubled the maximum amount of steady-state IL-6 mRNA achieved 3 h after the addition of IL-1β, compared with cells that were not primed (Fig. 2A). When the cells were primed for 3 h, the time required to achieve the maximal level of IL-6 steady-state mRNA was decreased to 1 h, and half-maximal production of IL-6 protein occurred at 2 h as compared to ~4 h for no or 0.5 h of priming (Fig. 2B). Despite the increases in peak steady-state levels of IL-6 mRNA that occurred with the 0.5- and 3-h priming protocols, there were no increases in the maximal amounts of IL-6 protein produced, relative to cells that were exposed to the three cytokines simultaneously. There was no detectable transcription of the IL-6 gene in BMMC before treatment with the recombinant cytokines (Fig. 3, lane 1). Exposure of BMMC for 0.5 h to KL + IL-10 alone (lane 2) or combined with IL-1β (lane 4) resulted in approximately the same elevation in the level of IL-6 gene transcription. In BMMC stimulated with KL + IL-10 for 3 h, the point at which steady-state IL-6 mRNA had decreased by 50% (Fig. 1C), IL-6 gene transcription continued unabated (Fig. 3, lane 3). The level of transcription remained unchanged in BMMC exposed to KL + IL-10 + IL-1β from 0.5 to 5 h (Fig. 3, lanes 4-6), a period in which the steady-state IL-6 mRNA level increased and peaked (Fig. 1C). IL-1β alone did not stimulate transcription of the IL-6 gene (data not shown). Nuclear run-on analyses were also performed with BMMC primed with KL + IL-10 for 0.5 and 3 h before the addition of IL-1β. The nuclei were harvested at 3 h (0.5-h priming) or 1 h (3-h priming), the times at which peak steady-state mRNA levels were indicated by RNA blot analysis for these experimental conditions. The level of transcription was not visibly altered by the addition of IL-1β after either duration of priming as compared to the level obtained with KL + IL-10 alone (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8 versus lanes 2 and 3). BMMC were treated with either KL + IL-10 for 0.5 h or KL + IL-10 + IL-1β for 3 h to establish peak mRNA levels before actinomycin D (5 µg/ml) was added to the cells. At various times thereafter, RNA was isolated from the cells, and IL-6 mRNA was examined by RNA blot analysis, as shown in a typical autoradiogram (Fig. 4, A and B) and by Betascope analysis of 18 S RNA-adjusted data (Fig. 4C). In BMMC treated with KL + IL-10, IL-6 mRNA had a calculated half-life of 0.4 h. This half-life was faster than the IL-6 mRNA decay time of 0.9 h in the absence of actinomycin D. In contrast, the half-life of IL-6 mRNA produced by BMMC treated with KL + IL-10 + IL-1β was 3.2 h, which was the same as the decay time in the absence of actinomycin D. At the protein level, actinomycin D added to BMMC 0.5 h after exposure to KL + IL-10 abrogated IL-6 production (data not shown). However, actinomycin D added to BMMC 3 h after exposure to KL + IL-10 + IL-1β did not reduce the production of IL-6 protein at any subsequent time point studied, as compared with BMMC that were not treated with actinomycin D (Fig. 4D). In contrast to the results obtained when actinomycin D was added after the cells were treated with KL + IL-10 + IL-1β, its addition 10 min before the cells were exposed to KL + IL-10 + IL-1β completely inhibited the appearance of IL-6 mRNA by RNA blot analysis (data not shown). The addition of actinomycin D to BMMC 0.5 h after the addition of the three cytokines resulted within an additional hour in the complete loss of the mRNA that had accumulated just before the actinomycin D was added (Fig. 4E). Thus, the effects of actinomycin D on IL-6 mRNA induced by the three exogenous cytokines were time-dependent. The stability of IL-6 mRNA induced by 0.5 and 3 h of priming BMMC with KL + IL-10 and the subsequent addition of IL-1β was studied by adding actinomycin D 3 and 1 h later, respectively, at the times of peak IL-6 mRNA levels for each sequence. The calculated half-lives of IL-6 mRNA elicited with the 0.5- and 3-h priming protocols were 0.9 and 1.0 h (Fig. 5), respectively, about twice the value obtained with BMMC stimulated with KL + IL-10 only. BMMC were preincubated with or without cycloheximide (10 µg/ml) for 0.5 h and then maintained either in medium alone or in medium with cytokines for 3 h before RNA isolation and blot analysis. The addition of cycloheximide to cells maintained in medium alone or in medium with 100 units/ml IL-3 resulted in an ~2-fold increase in the IL-6 mRNA level compared with the levels in cells maintained in the same medium without cycloheximide (shown in a representative experiment in Fig. 6A and analyzed from four experiments in Fig. 6B). KL + IL-10 stimulated a 5-fold increase in IL-6 mRNA relative to cells maintained in medium, and this increase was not changed significantly by preincubation of the BMMC with cycloheximide. In contrast, a 30-fold increase in IL-6 mRNA induced by KL + IL-10 + IL-1β was reduced by 52.8 ± 5.2% (mean ± S.E., n = 4) by preincubation of the cells with the drug. The effects of cycloheximide on IL-6 mRNA accumulation after gene induction were studied by adding cycloheximide to cells 10 min after the addition of KL + IL-10 (Fig. 7, A and C) and 1 h after the addition of KL + IL-10 + IL-1β (Fig. 7, B and C). In both cases, IL-6 mRNA was superinduced as assessed by the peak mRNA levels achieved in the presence of cycloheximide. To assess the potential role of IL-6 gene transcription in the superinducing effects of cycloheximide on IL-6 mRNA accumulation, nuclear run-on analyses were performed with BMMC cultured in KL + IL-10 + IL-1β without cycloheximide, and with cycloheximide added to cultures simultaneously with or 1 h after the three cytokines. The level of transcription in all three cases was essentially the same (data not shown). We have shown that a particular combination of exogenous cytokines acts synergistically to induce high levels of IL-6 expression in mouse BMMC and that these cytokines act at discrete steps in the pathway of IL-6 generation. Whereas stimulation of BMMC with KL + IL-10 increased steady-state levels of IL-6 mRNA by 2-fold with minimal release of IL-6 protein, the addition of IL-1β to the combination resulted in a 12-22-fold increase in the peak level of steady-state IL-6 mRNA and a 50-100-fold gain in protein to 9 to 30 ng of IL-6/106 BMMC (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Nuclear run-on analysis showed that approximately the same level of IL-6 gene transcription was induced 0.5 h after BMMC were exposed to KL + IL-10 with or without IL-1β (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the level of transcription was relatively unchanged throughout periods corresponding to the rise, peak, and decline phases of steady-state IL-6 mRNA elicited by these cytokine combinations (Fig. 1C). Thus, KL + IL-10 induces IL-6 gene transcription in BMMC, whereas IL-1β appears to act post-transcriptionally. As determined with actinomycin D, the half-life of IL-6 mRNA elicited by the three exogenous cytokines was 8-fold greater than that elicited by KL + IL-10 alone (Fig. 4). The increase in the half-life of IL-6 mRNA stimulated by IL-1β is attributed to the induction of a protein that stabilizes IL-6 mRNA, because preventing protein synthesis with cycloheximide 0.5 h before the addition of the three exogenous cytokines inhibited by ~50% the level of steady-state IL-6 mRNA generated, relative to cells not exposed to cycloheximide (Fig. 6). The generation of the stabilizing protein required transcription, because actinomycin D added 0.5 h after the addition of the three exogenous cytokines prevented the accumulation of steady-state IL-6 mRNA (Fig. 4E), even though maximal transcription of the IL-6 gene was already occurring at the time the actinomycin D was added (Fig. 3). One hour after the addition of KL + IL-10 + IL-1β to BMMC, the synthesis of the stabilizing factor appeared to be sufficient to stabilize transcripts, because cycloheximide added at that time did not decrease the level of IL-6 mRNA (Fig. 7, B and C). Thus, a protein that stabilizes IL-6 mRNA is made early after the addition of IL-1β to BMMC in which IL-6 gene transcription is being induced by KL + IL-10. Once made, the stabilizing protein appears to be long-lived, because the addition of actinomycin D to BMMC 3 h after the addition of the three exogenous cytokines did not accelerate the decay of IL-6 mRNA compared with that in cells not exposed to the drug (Fig. 4, A and B). Accordingly, the amount of IL-6 protein released from BMMC was not diminished by the addition of actinomycin D 3 h after the addition of KL + IL-10 + IL-1β (Fig. 4D). A second effect of KL + IL-10 on IL-6 mRNA was revealed by the finding that the addition of cycloheximide to BMMC after stimulation with KL + IL-10 with or without IL-1β increased the levels of steady-state IL-6 mRNA relative to that of cells not treated with the drug (Fig. 7). These results indicate that in addition to stimulating transcription of the IL-6 gene, the combination of KL + IL-10 induces a protein factor that destabilizes IL-6 mRNA, with no apparent contribution from IL-1β. Because the level of IL-6 gene transcription in BMMC treated with KL + IL-10 continued unabated (Fig. 3) during the period when the steady-state levels of IL-6 mRNA decline (Fig. 1C), it is likely that the destabilizing protein induced by KL + IL-10 is the predominant regulator of steady-state IL-6 mRNA levels and hence limits the amount of IL-6 protein released in the absence of IL-1β. Delaying the addition of IL-1β to BMMC exposed to KL + IL-10 by 0.5 and 3 h did not prevent the induction of high levels of steady-state IL-6 mRNA and the release of substantial IL-6 protein. Indeed, the peak IL-6 mRNA levels were ~2-fold greater when the addition of IL-1β was delayed (Fig. 2). The level of IL-6 gene transcription in cells exposed to IL-1β after the other two cytokines was similar to that in cells exposed to the three cytokines simultaneously (Fig. 3), and the half-lives of the steady-state IL-6 mRNA obtained with sequential addition of the cytokines were ~2-fold greater than those of cells exposed to KL + IL-10 alone (Fig. 5). These findings suggest that the greater peak accumulation of steady-state IL-6 mRNA levels that occurs with sequential cytokine addition in part provides the high levels of IL-6 protein released (Fig. 2). Thus, both the peak magnitude and post-peak half-life of steady-state IL-6 mRNA contribute importantly to the amount of IL-6 protein released, and both parameters are increased by the addition of IL-1β to KL + IL-10. In BMMC, IL-1β also acts synergistically with KL + IL-10 for the induction of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-2 (12Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22269-22275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with attendant downstream prostaglandin D2 release. However, the possibility that IL-1β was acting at a step(s) distinct from that of KL + IL-10 was not examined. As with IL-6 elaboration, IL-1β cannot be replaced by other cytokines to induce prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-2 synthesis in combination with KL + IL-10 (19Murakami M. Penrose J.F. Urade Y. Arm J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6107-6111Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, the combination of KL + IL-10 + IL-1β appears to be unique in providing an alternative to immunoglobulin activation of mast cells for generation of IL-6 and prostaglandin D2 through the induction of essential pathways for product formation and stabilization. The fact that KL and IL-10 also both mediate mast cell development (20Murakami M. Austen K.F. Bingham III, C.O. Friend D.S. Penrose J.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22653-22656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) is compatible with their being present at sites of mast cell hyperplasia, where these cytokines may additionally provide a stimulus for regulated mast cell activation in conjunction with a proinflammatory cytokine such as IL-1β. Indeed, KL is widely expressed on epithelium and stromal cells (21Lammie A. Drobnjak M. Gerald W. Saad A. Cote R. Cordon-Cardo C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 1417-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), IL-10 is produced by bronchial epithelial cells (22Bonfield T.L. Konstan M.W. Burfeind P. Panuska J.R. Hilliard J.B. Berger M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and IL-1 is found in airway walls during late asthmatic reactions (23Okada S. Inoue H. Yamauchi K. Iijima H. Ohkawara Y. Takishima T. Shirato K. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1995; 95: 1236-1245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, this combination of cytokines is likely present at sites of allergic inflammation and may indeed provide an alternative pathway to mast cell activation of cytokine release in vivo. The steps by which IL-1 species and other exogenous cytokines act synergistically to produce IL-6 have been defined for a limited number of cases. In human fibroblasts, IL-1α and TNF-α each stimulate transcription of the IL-6 gene and synergistically induce expression of steady-state IL-6 mRNA and protein (24Elias J.A. Lentz V. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 161-166PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the half-life of IL-6 mRNA induced by the two exogenous cytokines is ~3 times greater than the half-life of IL-6 mRNA induced by each cytokine alone. IL-1α and TGF-β1 synergistically increase transcription of the IL-6 gene, steady-state IL-6 mRNA, and release of IL-6 protein in human fibroblasts (25Elias J.A. Lentz V. Cummings P.J. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3437-3443PubMed Google Scholar). IL-1β also elicits IL-6 gene transcription in human fibroblasts, promotes stabilization of the mRNA, and acts synergistically with TNF-α to increase steady-state IL-6 mRNA levels and release protein (26Ng S.B. Tan Y.H. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19021-19027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate that in mouse BMMC, IL-1β neither elicits transcription of the IL-6 gene nor enhances transcription stimulated by KL + IL-10, but rather acts to stabilize IL-6 mRNA induced by the latter two cytokines. Thus, IL-1β can act at a discrete step from other cytokines with which it acts synergistically so as to produce appreciable release of IL-6 protein. The AU-rich, 3′-untranslated regions of many protooncogene and cytokine mRNA species contain single or multiple copies of the sequence AUUUA, which, in the proper context, target these mRNAs for rapid degradation and may also suppress their translation (27Caput D.

A. 1987; 84: 6030-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). IL-6 mRNA contains multiple copies of the AUUUA sequence, and factors that bind AUUUA-containing regions so as to regulate other mRNAs have been described. AUF1 is a cytosolic factor that speeds the decay of c-myc mRNA and granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) mRNA in erythroleukemia cells (33Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), whereas AUBF stablizes GM-CSF mRNA by binding to and protecting the AUUUA sequence element from destabilizing factors (34Rajagopalan L.E. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23882-23888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the interplay between these opposing factors determines the degradation rate of the GM-CSF mRNA. Our data indicate that cytokine-induced IL-6 gene expression in BMMC is regulated in a sequential manner. The combination of KL + IL-10 both stimulates IL-6 gene transcription and counter-regulates its effects by inducing a transcript destabilizing factor. IL-1β causes the early induction of an IL-6 transcript stabilizing factor that appears to be long-lived. Because the amount of IL-6 protein produced depends critically on the effects of added IL-1β, factors analogous to AUF1 and AUBF that alter IL-6 mRNA levels may be the key regulators of mast cell production of IL-6 in response to cytokine signals from the microenvironment. We thank Julie Benes and Jean Chambers for the preparation and maintenance of BMMC. We also thank Dr. Ryoji Matsumoto for providing the recombinant viral stocks for the production of KL and IL-10 used in this study."

In the first step, pAd docks onto the 37-kDa protein of the outer membrane (OM37) as a complex with MSF (stage I intermediate). It is then transferred to the import pore of OM in the presence of ATP, but in the absence of Δψ across the inner membrane (IM), to form stage II intermediate. Depletion of matrix ATP in the presence of both extramitochondrial ATP and Δψ induces accumulation of stage III intermediate, which is a mixture of the precursor with different intramitochondrial localizations: the precursor whose presequence had crossed either OM (IIIa) or both OM and IM (IIIb), but with a bulk portion remaining exposed to the cytosol and the precursor whose presequence had crossed both membranes, but with a residual portion staying within the intermembrane space (IIIc).

The precursor is then transferred to the Tom20-Tom22 complex prior to translocation across OM and IM. We have also characterized a similar precursor-targeting pathway in rat liver mitochondria: precursor-MSF complex docks onto a 37-kDa protein of OM (OM37), the precursor is then transferred to rat Tom20 depending upon ATP hydrolysis, and then imported into the mitochondria (14Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, extramitochondrial ATP proved to be necessary for the MSF-dependent import of precursor proteins. Urea-denatured precursors or precursors which can maintain the unfolded conformation by complexing with hsp70, bypass Tom37-Tom70, and are directly targeted to Tom20 prior to transport into the matrix. This process does not require extramitochondrial ATP (14Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the present study, we detected intermediates in the process of MSF-dependent import of a precursor into rat liver mitochondria by depleting ATP outside or inside the mitochondria or Δψ across IM. The intermediates were characteristic in their salt and alkali extractability, protease accessibility, and submitochondrial localization as well as in their accessibility to the antibodies against OM37 and Tom20. All these intermediates were productive since they could be chased successively to the downstream stages by the manipulation of energy. Thus, six intermediates have been identified including two novel intermediates; one which docked onto OM37 as a complex with MSF and another which partially translocated across OM. MSF and hsp70 were purified from rat liver cytosol according to previously described procedures (16Hachiya N. Alam R. Sakasegawa Y. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 23Chirico W.J. Waters M.G. Blobel G. Nature. 1988; 332: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). pAd was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified in the presence of 7 M urea as described previously (24Iwahashi J. Furuya S. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Antibodies against OM37 and Tom20 of rat liver mitochondria were prepared as described (14Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Rat liver mitochondria were prepared according to the method of Sakaguchi et al. (25Sakaguchi M. Hachiya N. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Samples containing 125I-labeled components were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the gels were analyzed using a Fuji Bioimage Analyzer BAS 2000. Mitochondrial import of pAd in the pAd-MSF-hsp70 complex was performed as described previously with a slight modification (14Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, 125I-labeled components (14Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), pAd, hsp70, and MSF, were incubated in 50 µl of TKM (20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mM potassium acetate and 2 mM magnesium acetate) at 30°C for 30 min to form a complex. The import was performed at 30°C for 50 min in 100 µl of the “import buffer” (10 mM HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM sodium succinate, 5 mM NADH) containing 100 µg of mitochondria (or mitoplasts) and the 125I-labeled pAd-MSF-hsp70 complex. The reaction mixtures were centrifuged to separate the mitochondria and the supernatant fractions. Both fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the gels were analyzed with a Fuji Bioimage Analyzer BAS2000. 100 µg of mitochondria were incubated with 20 units/ml apyrase in 50 µl of the import buffer containing 200 µg/ml carboxyatractyloside (CAT) at 30°C for 30 min. The mitochondria were washed once with the import buffer and used for the import. Mitochondria were incubated with 5 µM carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) in the import buffer at 0°C for 5 min and washed once with the import buffer. 100 µg of mitochondria were incubated with 20 µM oligomycin and 200 µg/ml CAT in 50 µl of the import buffer at 30°C for 20 min and washed once with the import buffer. Chase of stage I intermediate to stage II was performed as follows. Stage I intermediate-accumulated mitochondria were incubated with 5 µM CCCP at 0°C for 5 min and subjected to the chase reaction in the presence or absence of 1 mM ATP at 30°C for 30 min. Chase of stage II to stage III was performed as follows. Stage II intermediate-accumulated mitochondria were suspended into the import buffer (minus respiratory substrates) containing 200 µg/ml CAT and 20 µM oligomycin, incubated at 30°C for 20 min, and then subjected to the chase reaction in the presence or the absence of 10 mM DTT at 30°C for 30 min. Chase of stage III intermediate into the matrix was performed as follows. Stage III intermediate-accumulated mitochondria were suspended into the import buffer (minus respiratory substrates). Chase reaction was started by the addition of sodium succinate to generate the substrate level of ATP in the matrix (26Wachter C. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and incubated at 30°C for 30 min. Stage I or stage II intermediate-accumulated mitochondria (100 µg) were incubated with 1 mg/ml of the ammonium sulfate-fractionated IgGs at 0°C for 60 min and then washed once with the import buffer. The intermediate-accumulated mitochondria (100 µg) were mixed with the intact mitochondria (4-5 mg) and subjected to hypotonic treatment in 1 ml of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 50 mM potassium acetate at 0°C for 30 min followed by sonication with a Bio Ruptor (COSMO BIO) for 30 s, 5 times, at 30-s intervals. The sonicated mixtures were layered over a linear gradient of 0.65-1.75 M sucrose in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 26,000 rpm for 15 h in an RPS40T rotor (Hitachi). After centrifugation, 0.7-ml fractions were collected from the top of the tubes, diluted with 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to precipitate the membrane fractions. We first tried to detect intermediates during MSF-dependent import of the matrix-targeted precursor into rat liver mitochondria. 125I-Labeled components, pAd, MSF, and hsp70, were mixed to form the pAd-MSF-hsp70 complex (14Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and the ternary complex was used as the import substrate. When the complex was subjected to the standard import assay, hsp70 and MSF were released into the supernatant, while pAd was imported and both pAd and mature adrenodoxin were recovered from the mitochondria (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). When the import was performed in the absence of extramitochondrial ATP, hsp70 was released into the supernatant, whereas the release of MSF and the import of pAd were arrested and both were recovered from the mitochondria (lanes 3 and 4). The mitochondria which had accumulated import-arrested pAd and MSF were subjected to the chase reaction under various salt concentrations. In the absence of ATP, but in the presence of respiratory substrates, MSF and pAd remained stably bound to the mitochondria, irrespective of the salt concentrations (lanes 5, 6, 9, and 10). In the presence of ATP and the respiratory substrates, the import arrest was relieved irrespective of the salt concentrations and MSF was released into the supernatant (lanes 7, 8, 11, and 12), indicating that this complex is a productive intermediate. We herein refer to this complex as stage I intermediate. When the import reaction was performed using mitochondria which had been treated with CCCP to dissipate Δψ across IM, the import of pAd was arrested and ≈53% of the precursor was recovered from the mitochondria (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). hsp70, MSF, and the remaining portion of pAd were released into the supernatant. The import-arrested form of pAd was chased into the mitochondria when Δψ was established by DTT under the standard import condition (lanes 7 and 8). However, if the chase reaction was performed in the presence of 100 mM NaCl but in the absence of DTT, the precursor was released into the supernatant (lanes 9 and 10), and the import was not restored even if Δψ was established (lanes 11 and 12). The salt-sensitive intermediate which accumulated in the absence of Δψ is referred to as stage II intermediate. The intermediate is similar to the general insertion pore (GIP) intermediate which has been detected during the import of precursors with matrix-targeted presequences, such as Su9-DHFR, hsp60, or cpn10, into the membrane potential-dissipated mitochondria. GIP intermediate is probably inserted into the import pore of OM; it is extractable with 100 mM NaCl and is accessible to externally added protease (27Haucke V. Lithgow T. Rospert S. Hahne K. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5565-5570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 28Horst M. Hilfiker-Rothenfluh S. Oppliger W. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2293-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We next analyzed the import intermediate which is formed after depletion of matrix ATP by treatment of mitochondria with oligomycin and CAT. As shown in Fig. 1C, hsp70 and MSF were released into the supernatant, although the import was arrested and ≈48% of pAd was recovered from the mitochondria (lanes 3 and 4). The reason why a significant fraction of pAd was released into the supernatant in the absence of Δψ (Fig. 1B) or matrix ATP (Fig. 1C) is still unclear at present. The accumulated intermediate remained stably associated to the mitochondria after incubation in the presence of 100 mM NaCl (lanes 9 and 10). When the intermediate-accumulated mitochondria were incubated in the presence of the respiratory substrate, the import occurred irrespective of the salt conditions (lanes 7, 8, 11, and 12). This intermediate was thus distinct from that of stage I or stage II and is referred to as stage III intermediate. We have shown in rat liver mitochondria that the pAd-MSF complex first docks onto OM37, ATP hydrolysis induces dissociation of MSF from the docking complex and then pAd is imported into the matrix via Tom20 (14Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the above described intermediates can be driven consecutively to other stages by manipulating ATP outside or inside the mitochondria or Δψ. We first investigated whether stage I intermediate is followed by stage II along the import pathway (Fig. 2A). The mitochondria carrying stage I intermediate (lane 1) were treated with CCCP to dissipate Δψ and were then subjected to the chase reaction in the presence or absence of extramitochondrial ATP. When incubated in the absence of extramitochondrial ATP, MSF and pAd remained stably bound to the mitochondria, irrespective of the salt conditions (lanes 3, 4, 9, and 10). When the chase was performed under the standard ion concentration and in the presence of extramitochondrial ATP, pAd remained bound to the membrane and MSF was released into the supernatant (lanes 5 and 6). However, when the same reaction was performed in the presence of 100 mM NaCl, both MSF and ≈50% of pAd were released into the supernatant (lanes 11 and 12). It seemed that 100 mM NaCl partially inhibited the chase reaction, since an intermediate which was present between stage I and stage II, but not stage II intermediate, was resistant to the extraction with 100 mM NaCl (see below; Fig. 3A, lane 7). We conclude that pAd in stage I intermediate is chased to stage II depending upon extramitochondrial ATP. We next examined whether stage II intermediate can be chased to form stage III intermediate. The mitochondria which had accumulated stage II intermediate (Fig. 2B, lane 1) were treated with CAT and oligomycin in order to deplete matrix ATP, and were then subjected to the chase reaction. In the presence of both matrix ATP and Δψ, the intermediate was chased into the mitochondria accompanied by a processing of pAd (lanes 7 and 8). However, in cases where the matrix ATP had been depleted, no import was observed even when Δψ was established (lanes 5 and 6). Stage II intermediate was efficiently extracted with 100 mM NaCl (lanes 9 and 10), confirming previous results. In marked contrast, if stage II intermediate was subjected to the chase reaction by establishing Δψ, the precursor became resistant to salt extraction (lanes 11 and 12). Thus, Δψ initiated a transition from stage II to stage III, which in turn led the precursor to become resistant to salt extraction. Finally, the stage III intermediate can be chased efficiently into the matrix irrespective of the presence or absence of Δψ, which is accompanied by a processing of the precursor (data not shown). A rough calculation indicated that 68% of the intermediate was competent for the chase reaction in the absence of Δψ, suggesting that the remaining portion of pAd had not penetrated the IM (see also Table I). In summary, import of the precursor proceeds consecutively through stage I, stage II, and stage III intermediates and eventually into the matrix. We next tried to obtain information about the membrane components that interact with these intermediates. Stage I intermediate-accumulated mitochondria were incubated with the antibodies against porin, Tom20, or OM37, washed once with the import buffer, and then subjected to the import in the presence of extramitochondrial ATP, respiratory substrates, and 100 mM NaCl. The antibodies against porin, a major OM protein which is unrelated to the protein-import machinery, inhibited neither the release of MSF into the supernatant nor the import of pAd into the mitochondria (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). The antibodies against OM37 inhibited both the release of MSF into the supernatant and the import of pAd into the mitochondria (lanes 9 and 10). The precursor apparently remained in stage I, since it remained bound to the membrane as a complex with MSF even under high-salt conditions (compare lanes 9 and 10 with lanes 3 and 4). These results, in conjunction with our previous data that the antibodies against OM37 inhibited docking of the pAd-MSF complex to the membrane (14Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), indicate that the antibodies inhibit the release of the precursor from the receptor as well as the docking of the pAd-MSF complex to the receptor. In contrast, the antibodies against Tom20 did not inhibit the release of MSF from the docking complex, but instead inhibited the access of pAd to Tom20, keeping the precursor resistant to salt treatment (lanes 7 and 8). Thus, a new intermediate can be distinguished: it does not coexist with MSF, it is located at OM37 or between OM37 and Tom20 and it is resistant to salt extraction. No further characterizations have been carried out with this intermediate. We then examined the effects of the antibodies to the chase reaction of stage II intermediate. As shown in Fig. 3B, the antibodies against porin or OM37 did not inhibit its import into the mitochondria (lanes 5, 6, 9, and 10), indicating that the precursor had passed the OM37 stage. Unexpectedly, on the other hand, the antibodies against Tom20 inhibited the import of pAd and kept the precursor in a salt-extractable state (lanes 7 and 8; also see Fig. 1B, lanes 9 and 10), indicating that the antibodies not only inhibit the precursor's access to Tom20 but also arrest the import at stage II intermediate. In view of the report that the import intermediate accumulated in the absence of Δψ is inserted into the import pore (28Horst M. Hilfiker-Rothenfluh S. Oppliger W. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2293-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 29Süllner T. Rassow J. Wiedmann M. Schlossmann J. Keil P. Neupert W. Pfanner N. Nature. 1992; 355: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), the present results may indicate that Tom20 not only functions as the precursor receptor, but also constitutes a part of the import pore. We next examined the protease susceptibility of stage I, II, and III intermediates to probe their topological orientation within the membranes. As shown in Fig. 4A, stage I and II intermediates were susceptible to externally added proteinase K (lanes 1, 2, 4, and 5). pAd was not detected in the mitoplasts prepared from the mitochondria carrying stage I or II intermediate (lanes 3 and 6), indicating that the mitoplasts were completely deprived of OM and pAd was entirely localized to OM. In contrast, ≈35% of pAd at stage III was resistant to proteinase K treatment (lanes 7 and 8), indicating that this fraction had been translocated across OM, whereas ≈65% of pAd had assumed a state in which the bulk of the molecule was exposed to the outer surface of the mitochondria (see below). When the mitoplasts were prepared from proteinase K-treated mitochondria, pAd was recovered to the mitoplasts at a high yield (compare lanes 8 and 9). This fraction of the precursor was completely digested with proteinase K (lane 10), indicating that the precursor had bound to IM with a bulk portion remaining exposed to the intermembrane space. We examined whether the proteinase K-resistant and mitoplast-bound fraction of stage III intermediate (IIIc in Fig. 6; see also Fig. 4A, lane 9) can be imported into the mitoplasts. The mitochondria which had accumulated stage III intermediate were isolated (Fig. 4B, lane 1), digested with proteinase K (lane 2) and subjected to hypotonic sonication treatment in order to isolate the mitoplasts (lane 3). pAd in the recovered mitoplasts was accessible to the externally added proteinase K (lane 4), although it was efficiently imported into the mitoplasts to form proteinase K-resistant mature adrenodoxin when matrix ATP was replenished (lanes 5 and 6) irrespective of the absence (lanes 7 and 8) or the presence (lanes 5 and 6) of Δψ. These results indicate that the presequence portion of the proteinase K-inaccessible precursor had translocated across IM (30Hwang S.T. Wachter C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21083-21089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Rassow J. Pfanner N. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 32Cyr D.M. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23751-23754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ryan K.R. Jensen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23743-23746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intermediate-accumulated mitochondria were subjected to hypotonic sonication treatment and analyzed by a sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Glutathione S-transferase as a marker of OM peaked at around fractions 5 and 6, while succinate dehydrogenase as a marker of IM peaked at around fractions 8 and 9 (Fig. 5A). The mature form of adrenodoxin was recovered in fractions 1 through 3 (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, stage I and II intermediates were mainly recovered from OM fractions (fractions 5 through 7) with a small portion being recovered from IM fractions. Submitochondrial localization of stage III intermediate differed significantly from that of other intermediates (Fig. 5B). It should be noted that the binding states of pAd recovered from OM (fraction 5) of each intermediate stage were distinct from each other: pAd from stages I and III was resistant to extraction with 150 mM NaCl, whereas the precursor from stage II was sensitive to treatment (Fig. 5C). Mayer et al. (34Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) have shown in vitro that Neurospora crassa OM can translocate the presequence of the precursor, rendering the precursor resistant to salt extraction. In view of these data, we speculate that pAd in fraction 5 from stage III intermediate (IIIa in Fig. 6) is different from that of stage II in that its presequence portion had translocated across OM to the intermembrane space (see “Discussion”). To summarize, these results indicate that stage III contained pAd with distinct membrane localizations (see Fig. 6): pAd bound to OM with the presequence portion translocated across the membrane (IIIa); pAd crossing both OM and IM, but with a bulk portion of the precursor remaining exposed to the cytoplasm (IIIb); and pAd recovered from the mitoplasts, with the presequence portion having translocated across IM, but with the bulk portion of the molecule remaining within the intermembrane space (IIIc). These are productive intermediates since they were efficiently imported into mitochondria after the re-establishment of Δψ and matrix ATP. A rough calculation indicated that these intermediates are present at an almost equal amount within the mitochondria (Table I). The protein import system of mammalian mitochondria could be expected to be basically similar to that of other organisms, such as yeast and N. crassa, since yeast mitochondrial precursors are efficiently imported into mammalian mitochondria or vice versa and, since the mitochondrial import in these organisms exhibits similar energy requirements. To learn more about the import machinery of mammalian mitochondria, we have resolved the mitochondrial import of the matrix-targeted precursor into several consecutive steps. Although it has been difficult with available methods to arrest the precursors at the surface of the mitochondria and to control their entry into the translocation machinery, as well as to prevent a high degree of unspecific binding of these precursors (38Lithgow T. Junne T. Suda K. Gratzer S. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11973-11977Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), our method, using the unfolded pAd which had been complexed with MSF, hsp70, or both as the import-substrate was able to circumvent these obstacles. A model for the initial steps of precursor transport into rat mitochondria is shown in Fig. 6. Binding of the precursor to MSF enhances the affinity of MSF to the membrane receptor (14Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Hachiya N. Komiya T. Alam R. Iwahashi J. Sakaguchi M. Omura T. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5146-5154Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), inducing an efficient docking of the precursor-MSF complex onto the membrane receptor (OM37 as a subunit) to form a novel stage I intermediate. Hydrolysis of the extramitochondrial ATP induces dissociation of the complex and the precursor is transferred to the putative import channel of OM via rat Tom20 to form stage II intermediate; this intermediate is the same as the GIP intermediate, since they were formed in the presence of extramitochondrial ATP, but in the absence of Δψ (29Süllner T. Rassow J. Wiedmann M. Schlossmann J. Keil P. Neupert W. Pfanner N. Nature. 1992; 355: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 35Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7528-7536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this process a novel, salt-resistant intermediate which had been freed of MSF and which was located between stages I and II (“X” in Fig. 6) could be detected, although this intermediate still remains to be characterized. Then, presequence of the precursor translocates OM and Δψ induces translocation of the presequence across IM. Thus, stage III intermediates (IIIa, IIIb, and IIIc) became accumulated in the presence of Δψ, but in the absence of matrix ATP. By replenishing matrix ATP, a significant fraction of stage III intermediate could be chased into the matrix in the absence of Δψ, confirming previous reports with yeast and N. crassa, where intermediates identical to IIIb (32Cyr D.M. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23751-23754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and IIIc (30Hwang S.T. Wachter C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21083-21089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Rassow J. Pfanner N. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were identified. In this context, IIIa has not previously been detected within mitochondria and is, therefore, a novel intermediate. Whether IIIa and IIIc are actually formed when the precursor is actively imported into the mitochondria still remains to be clarified, although these intermediates can be used as a useful substrate for dissecting the import machinery of OM and IM. In yeast, Tom20 cooperates with Tom22 to function as the receptor for mitochondrial targeting sequences (27Haucke V. Lithgow T. Rospert S. Hahne K. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5565-5570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 36Mayer A. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Lill R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4202-4211Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We have shown here that the antibodies against rat Tom20 inhibit the precursor's access to Tom20. Furthermore, they inhibit the Δψ-dependent chase of stage II or GIP intermediate (Fig. 3). These results indicate that Tom20 functions not only as the precursor receptor, but also as a component of the translocation pore. In contrast to our results, Kiebler et al. (37Kiebler M. Keil P. Schneider H. van der Klei I.J. Pfanner N. Neupert W. Cell. 1993; 74: 483-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) have reported that the antibodies against Tom22 inhibit the accumulation of the GIP intermediate, while those against Tom20 do not. Whether this discrepancy was caused by a difference in the recognition specificities of the antibodies or by a difference in the import system between N. crassa and mammals remains unknown at present. How does the presequence portion of the precursors translocate across OM? It has been proposed in N. crassa that the presequence is recognized by the acidic domain in Tom20 and Tom22 and is reversibly transferred into the putative translocation pore, where it then binds stably to the site located at the inner face of OM, the “trans site,” to form the “OM insertion intermediate” (27Haucke V.

Our study demonstrated that stage II intermediate formed in the absence of Δψ was extractable with 100 mM NaCl. Whereas, when stage II intermediate was subjected to the chase reaction in the presence of Δψ, but in the absence of matrix ATP, in order to accumulate stage III intermediate, the precursor acquired resistance to salt extraction. One-third of stage III intermediate was composed of the OM-bound form of pAd and this form (IIIa) was resistant to salt extraction. Thus, the membrane-binding states of stage II and IIIa intermediates are distinct. This was further confirmed by the finding that when the pAd-hsp70 complex was incubated with OM isolated from intact mitochondria, pAd acquired resistance to salt extraction in a time-dependent fashion. The experiment with the mitochondrial processing peptidase-enclosed OM vesicles has clearly shown that this corresponds well with the translocation of the presequence across the membranes. 2T. Komiya and K. Mihara, manuscript in preparation. We thus speculate that Δψ affects partial translocation of the presequence across OM, in addition to driving translocation of the presequence across IM (2Pfanner N. Neupert W. Annu. Rev.

INTRODUCTIONThe CYP11A1 (SCC) gene encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450scc (cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme) that catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, the first and rate-limiting step in the synthesis of all steroids (1Miller W.L. Endocr. Rev. 1988; 9: 295-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). P450scc functions as a monooxygenase in the mitochondrion, using electrons transported from its cofactor ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin for oxidation/reduction reactions. The human SCC gene is located on chromosome 15 (2Chung B.-C. Matteson K.J. Voutilainen R. Mohandas T.K. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8962-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Its expression follows a developmentally programmed, cell type-specific, and hormonally regulated pattern. P450scc first appears in the adrenal primordia and fetal gonads at gestational days 11-12 in rodent embryos (3Rogler L.E. Pintar J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 453-461PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ikeda Y. Shen W.-H. Ingraham H.A. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The expression of P450scc is further stimulated by adrenocorticotropin and gonadotropin in the adrenal and gonads, respectively, using cAMP as an intracellular mediator (5Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In addition, there are other sites of P450scc expression. Placenta expresses P450scc to provide progesterone necessary for pregnancy (2Chung B.-C. Matteson K.J. Voutilainen R. Mohandas T.K. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8962-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Brain and the primitive gut of mouse embryo express a small amount of P450scc (6Keeney D.S. Ikeda Y. Waterman M.R. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1091-1098PubMed Google Scholar, 7Mellon S.H. Deschepper C.F. Brain Res. 1993; 629: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). With a few exceptions (8Chen C.-T. Guo I.-C. Chung B.-C. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 9: 803-810Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), regulation of P450scc gene expression in most cell types is at the transcriptional level (9John M.E. John M.C. Boggaram V. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4715-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).The cis-acting elements that control the tissue-specific and hormonal regulation of the SCC gene have been under extensive investigation (10Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27783-27786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sites responsible for cAMP-dependent expression have been identified. One site close to the basal promoter consists of G-rich sequences which bind Sp1-like proteins (11Guo I.-C. Tsai H.-M. Chung B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6362-6369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Venepally P. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25402-25410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This G-rich sequence is also found in other steroidogenic genes such as ferredoxin (13Chang C.-Y. Huang C. Guo I.-C. Tsai H.-M. Wu D.-A. Chung B.-C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1362-1370PubMed Google Scholar), CYP21 (14Chang S.-F. Chung B.-C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1330-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and CYP19 (15Zhao Y. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 340-349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another cAMP-responsive sequence is located further upstream and contain sequences similar to cAMP-responsive element termed CRE (16Watanabe N. Inoue H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The sequence controlling phorbol ester response was found close to the basal promoter of the SCC gene (17Moore C.C.D. Brentano S.T. Miller W.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 6013-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18Lauber M.E. Picton H.M. Begeot M. Momoi K. Waterman M.R. Simpson E.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 94: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).In different cell types, the expression of the SCC gene follows different regulatory mechanisms. The adrenal and placenta use different control elements for gene expression and cAMP stimulation (19Guo I.-C. Huang C. Chung B.-C. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Hum D.W. Aza-Blanc P. Miller W.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Glioma cell line C6 also contains transcription factors that are different from those in the adrenal cell line Y1 for gene expression (21Zhang P. Rodriguez H. Mellon S.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The adrenal and gonads are derived from the same progenitor cells (4Ikeda Y. Shen W.-H. Ingraham H.A. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar); therefore it is not surprising that they share the same transcriptional control elements.One major transcription factor in the adrenal and gonad that controls SCC gene expression is steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1 or Ad4BP). 1The abbreviations used are: SF1steroidogenic factor 1oligooligonucleotidetkthymidine kinaseCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase. SF1 is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family that binds to the AAGGTCA sequence (22Honda S. Morohashi K. Nomura M. Takeya H. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7494-7502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Almost all steroidogenic genes including SCC contains AAGGTCA sequence and is stimulated by SF1 transcriptionally (23Rice D.A. Mouw A.R. Bogerd A.M. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). SF1, however, is not the only factor that controls tissue-specific expression of steroidogenic genes. P450c21 and P450c11 are expressed only in the adrenal, despite the abundant expression of SF1 in the gonad. Therefore, there must be other transcription factors that control the adrenal-specific expression of P450c21 and P450c11. The equal distribution of SF1 in all three zones of the adrenal cortex cannot explain zone-specific transcription of CYP11B1 (24Mukai K. Mitani F. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6003-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, SF1 alone does not achieve the highest level of expression observed in these cell types.Previously we have identified a DNA region at 1.9 kilobase pairs upstream from the transcription start site that augments transcription of the human SCC promoter above the basal level (11Guo I.-C. Tsai H.-M. Chung B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6362-6369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we have further characterized this region and found that multiple proteins including Sp1- and NF1-like proteins bind to this region. The combined action of these proteins upon binding to the upstream sites resulted in cell type-specific enhancement of transcription of the human SCC gene.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we characterized the upstream AdE elements of the human CYP11A1 gene. The sequence was composed of two major protein binding regions AdE1 and AdE2, which functioned in steroidogenic cell-specific gene activation. All the tested steroidogenic cell lines, including two adrenal cell lines Y1 and H295, a mouse testis Leydig cell line MA10, and a human placental cell line JEG-3, support the activation function of AdE elements (Table II). The AdE sequences, on the other hand, are not functional in nonsteroidogenic cell lines COS-1 and Rat-1.Besides AdE, a key regulator for steroidogenic gene expression, transcription factor SF1, functions in many steroidogenic cells including adrenal and gonad (36Ikeda Y. Lala D.S. Luo X. Kim E. Moisan M.-R. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SF1, however, is not expressed in such steroidogenic organ as placenta. 2I.-C. Guo and B.-C. Chung, unpublished observation. Therefore SF1 is not the sole factor that determines cell type specificity of steroidogenic gene expression. AdE sequences are functional in multiple steroidogenic cells including placenta, showing that they could enhance or modulate SCC transcription in many steroidogenic cells.Many proteins bound to the AdE sequences. NF1-like proteins were the most prominent ones. The rest included Sp1-like and other as yet unidentified proteins. NF1 belongs to a protein family containing related proteins which recognize similar TGG(C/A)(N)5GCCAA sequences (35Goyal N. Knox J. Gronostajski R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 38Santoro C. Mermod N. Andrews P.C. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 334: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 39Gil G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8197-8206Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Sp1, on the other hand, activates transcription of many genes through its binding to the GGGGCGG or GGGGAGG sequences (48Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Sp1 also belongs to a protein family consisting of multiple related members with similar DNA-binding specificity (49Hagen G.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar).Both NF1 and Sp1 exert their activation function through interaction with other transcription factors. Sp1 has been shown to form multimeric complexes (52Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), to interact with coactivators (53Gill G. Pascal E.

Cell. 1991; 65: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Likewise, NF1 exerts its function through synergistic interaction with a number of different transcription factors in a wide range of situations (43Allan G.F. Ing N.H. Tsai S.Y. Srinivasan G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8197-8206Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Combinatorial interaction of various transcription factors bound to their cognate binding sites of the gene has become a paradigm of eukaryotic gene activation.NF1 and Sp1 are both considered general transcription factors. In deed, NF1- and Sp1-like proteins were also found bound to the AdE sequences in COS-1 cells (data not shown). It is therefore intriguing to find out how common transcription factors can determine cell type-specific expression. NF1 family members have been shown to be involved in liver-, adipocyte-, and epithelial cell-specific functions (58Jackson D.A. Rowader K.E. Stevens K. Jiang C. Milos P. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 59Graves R.A. Tontonoz P. Ross S.R. Spiegelman B.M.

It is believed that synergism between factors that vary in concentration in different cells results in cell type-specific transcriptional activation (61Grayson J. Williams R.S. Yu Y.-T. Bassel-Duby R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1870-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 62Costa R.H. Grayson D.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell.

In one situation, NF1 could interact with tissue-specific transcription factors for tissue-specific activation (58Jackson D.A. Rowader K.E. Stevens K. Jiang C. Milos P. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 65Graves R.A. Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1202-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the other situation, it is the balance of different NF1 family members that controls cell type specificity. In epithelial cells, the NF1 protein is derived from NF1-C, although in fibroblast cells, the major NF1 protein is NF1-X. NF1-X protein fails to activate enhancer function due to a variation in its activation domain. It is the property of NF1-X and the differential concentration of the NF1 family members that achieve the epithelial cell specificity of NF1 for human papillomavirus 16 expression (66Apt D. Liu Y. Bernard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3825-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Although being viewed as a ubiquitous transcription factor, substantial variations in Sp1 expression were found in different cell types, showing that its expression is developmentally programmed (67Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Because Sp1 belongs to a protein family consisting of multiple related members with similar DNA-binding specificity (49Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 50Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 51Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), it is possible that the variations in Sp1 levels in different cell types are attributed to detection of different members of the Sp1 family in these tissues. Some members of the Sp1 family could be expressed in a tissue-specific manner. BTEB2, an Sp1 family member that is homologous to Sp1 at the DNA-binding domain and recognizes the same GC box, is expressed specifically in testis and placenta (37Sogawa K. Imataka H. Yamasaki Y. Kusume H. Abe H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1527-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We showed that the Sp1-like protein being bound to the AdE sequences recognized the same sequence and shared the same antigenicity with Sp1, yet we do not know which member of the Sp1 family binds to the AdE sequences. It is possible that the tissue-specific expression of the SCC gene is determined by the steroidogenic tissue-specific expression of the BTEB-2-like protein.In conclusion, the AdE sequences of the human SCC gene contains binding sites for Sp1- and NF1-like proteins. It is the combined action of these bound and interacting factors that brings about the final activation of the SCC gene in a steroidogenic cell-specific manner. INTRODUCTIONThe CYP11A1 (SCC) gene encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450scc (cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme) that catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, the first and rate-limiting step in the synthesis of all steroids (1Miller W.L. Endocr. Rev. 1988; 9: 295-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). P450scc functions as a monooxygenase in the mitochondrion, using electrons transported from its cofactor ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin for oxidation/reduction reactions. The human SCC gene is located on chromosome 15 (2Chung B.-C. Matteson K.J. Voutilainen R. Mohandas T.K. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8962-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Its expression follows a developmentally programmed, cell type-specific, and hormonally regulated pattern. P450scc first appears in the adrenal primordia and fetal gonads at gestational days 11-12 in rodent embryos (3Rogler L.E. Pintar J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 453-461PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ikeda Y. Shen W.-H. Ingraham H.A. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The expression of P450scc is further stimulated by adrenocorticotropin and gonadotropin in the adrenal and gonads, respectively, using cAMP as an intracellular mediator (5Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In addition, there are other sites of P450scc expression. Placenta expresses P450scc to provide progesterone necessary for pregnancy (2Chung B.-C. Matteson K.J. Voutilainen R. Mohandas T.K. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8962-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Brain and the primitive gut of mouse embryo express a small amount of P450scc (6Keeney D.S. Ikeda Y. Waterman M.R. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1091-1098PubMed Google Scholar, 7Mellon S.H. Deschepper C.F. Brain Res. 1993; 629: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). With a few exceptions (8Chen C.-T. Guo I.-C. Chung B.-C. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 9: 803-810Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), regulation of P450scc gene expression in most cell types is at the transcriptional level (9John M.E. John M.C. Boggaram V. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4715-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).The cis-acting elements that control the tissue-specific and hormonal regulation of the SCC gene have been under extensive investigation (10Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27783-27786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sites responsible for cAMP-dependent expression have been identified. One site close to the basal promoter consists of G-rich sequences which bind Sp1-like proteins (11Guo I.-C. Tsai H.-M. Chung B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6362-6369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Venepally P. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25402-25410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This G-rich sequence is also found in other steroidogenic genes such as ferredoxin (13Chang C.-Y. Huang C. Guo I.-C. Tsai H.-M. Wu D.-A. Chung B.-C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1362-1370PubMed Google Scholar), CYP21 (14Chang S.-F. Chung B.-C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1330-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and CYP19 (15Zhao Y. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 340-349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another cAMP-responsive sequence is located further upstream and contain sequences similar to cAMP-responsive element termed CRE (16Watanabe N. Inoue H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The sequence controlling phorbol ester response was found close to the basal promoter of the SCC gene (17Moore C.C.D. Brentano S.T. Miller W.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 6013-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18Lauber M.E. Picton H.M. Begeot M. Momoi K. Waterman M.R. Simpson E.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 94: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).In different cell types, the expression of the SCC gene follows different regulatory mechanisms. The adrenal and placenta use different control elements for gene expression and cAMP stimulation (19Guo I.-C. Huang C. Chung B.-C. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Hum D.W. Aza-Blanc P. Miller W.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Glioma cell line C6 also contains transcription factors that are different from those in the adrenal cell line Y1 for gene expression (21Zhang P. Rodriguez H. Mellon S.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The adrenal and gonads are derived from the same progenitor cells (4Ikeda Y. Shen W.-H. Ingraham H.A. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar); therefore it is not surprising that they share the same transcriptional control elements.One major transcription factor in the adrenal and gonad that controls SCC gene expression is steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1 or Ad4BP). 1The abbreviations used are: SF1steroidogenic factor 1oligooligonucleotidetkthymidine kinaseCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase. SF1 is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family that binds to the AAGGTCA sequence (22Honda S. Morohashi K. Nomura M. Takeya H. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7494-7502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Almost all steroidogenic genes including SCC contains AAGGTCA sequence and is stimulated by SF1 transcriptionally (23Rice D.A. Mouw A.R. Bogerd A.M. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). SF1, however, is not the only factor that controls tissue-specific expression of steroidogenic genes. P450c21 and P450c11 are expressed only in the adrenal, despite the abundant expression of SF1 in the gonad. Therefore, there must be other transcription factors that control the adrenal-specific expression of P450c21 and P450c11. The equal distribution of SF1 in all three zones of the adrenal cortex cannot explain zone-specific transcription of CYP11B1 (24Mukai K. Mitani F. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6003-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, SF1 alone does not achieve the highest level of expression observed in these cell types.Previously we have identified a DNA region at 1.9 kilobase pairs upstream from the transcription start site that augments transcription of the human SCC promoter above the basal level (11Guo I.-C. Tsai H.-M. Chung B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6362-6369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we have further characterized this region and found that multiple proteins including Sp1- and NF1-like proteins bind to this region. The combined action of these proteins upon binding to the upstream sites resulted in cell type-specific enhancement of transcription of the human SCC gene."
https://openalex.org/W1975786733,"We characterized the cross-talk between activators of protein kinase A (PKA) and thyroid hormone (T3) in T3 receptor (TR)-mediated transcription. U937 cells were cotransfected with a plasmid expressing the TR and a reporter plasmid containing a T3 response element (TRE) oriented either as a direct repeat or as a palindrome upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. T3 activated transcription by 10-fold. T3 response was potentiated 2.5-3-fold by activators of PKA, but an activator of protein kinase C or of guanylate kinase was ineffective. In the absence of T3, activators of PKA had no effect on transcription. TR heterodimerization with the retinoid X receptor may facilitate T3/PKA cross-talk because coexpression of the retinoid X receptor potentiated cross-talk. Synergy was not observed in JEG-3, F9, CV-1, HeLa, L929, and HTC cells, indicating that it may require cell-specific factors. Synergy required the DNA- and ligand-binding domains, but not the amino-terminal domain, indicating that T3- and TRE-induced conformational changes on the TR are essential for cross-talk. PKA phosphorylated the TR in vitro, suggesting that, like other nuclear receptors, the TR is a target for PKA. These results imply that PKA cross-talks with T3 at the level of the TRE-bound TR, enhancing its transcriptional activity in a cell-specific manner.

Two genes code for TRs, but differential RNA splicing or promoter usage generates four isoforms: TRα1, TRα2, TRβ1, and TRβ2 (3Lazar M.A. Endocr.

Like other nuclear receptor superfamily members, TRs contain three major modular domains (2Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6339) Google Scholar, 3Lazar M.A. Endocr.

Med. 1995; 46: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain is presumably involved in transcriptional activation. The DNA-binding domain (DBD) directs receptor binding to specific thyroid hormone response elements (TREs), where TRs bind as monomers, homodimers, or heterodimers commonly with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) (7Sugawara A.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 860-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the progesterone receptor (20Denner L.A. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16548-16555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of nuclear receptors has been directly implicated in several of their properties, including hormone binding, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, dimerization, and transcriptional activation (21Kuiper G.G. Brinkmann A.O. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, studies of mutant receptors have not always provided a clear picture of the role of phosphorylation in receptor function. For example, the RAR is phosphorylated directly by PKA in vivo at serine 369, but mutation of serine 369 to alanine failed to abolish the PKA enhancement of RAR-mediated transcription; this finding suggests that PKA may affect the activity of other proteins involved in RAR-mediated transcription (17Rochette-Egly C. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Staub A. Pfister V. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Gaub M.-P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 860-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the issue of whether synergy between nuclear receptors and PKA is due to phosphorylation of receptors and/or other proteins is not resolved. It is important to examine the mechanisms of cross-talk between nuclear receptors and second messenger pathways given the interplay between these receptors and other proteins, all of which are potential targets for regulation by phosphorylation. In addition to RXRs, the action of the TR on the TRE is inhibited or augmented in a ligand-dependent manner by interactions with corepressors or coactivators, including the nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR), the silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT), the TR-interacting protein (TRIP1), and the steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) (22Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamel Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar, 23Kurokawa R.

Furthermore, PKA- and/or PKC-regulated transcription factors that act through other DNA elements, such as the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and the activator protein-1 (AP-1) complex, may also interact with the TR to influence TR function (28Stauber C. Altschmied J. Akerblom I.E. Marron J.L. Mellon P.L. New Biol. 1992; 4: 527-540PubMed Google Scholar, 29Lopez G. Schaufele F. Webb P. Holloway J.M. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. Mol. Cell.

There is evidence that T3 action and second messenger signaling pathways may be interrelated. T3 can affect the heart sensitivity to β-adrenergic stimuli (1Greenspan F.S. Greenspan F.S. Baxter J.D. Basic & Clinical Endocrinology. 4th Ed. Appleton & Lange, East Norwalk, CT1994: 160-226Google Scholar). This issue is of clinical importance because T3 and β-adrenergic agonists may interact to promote thyrotoxicosis. Although some of these cross-talk effects may be mediated by influences other than those on transcription, it is reported that T3 and cAMP effectors can independently stimulate the rat growth hormone promoter activity in rat pituitary GH4C1 cells (31Copp R.P. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 790-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and their combined effects are synergistic (31Copp R.P. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 790-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In fact, we previously demonstrated that synergistic activation of the rat growth hormone promoter in non-pituitary U937 cells requires the pituitary-specific factor Pit-1, the TR, and activators of both PKA and PKC, but this synergy was both T3- and TRE-independent (32Schaufele F. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 656-665PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these indications for potential cross-talk between T3 and second messenger systems, to our knowledge, there are no studies investigating whether PKA can alter T3 regulation of TR/TRE-mediated transcription. In this study, we examined the influence of activators of PKA, PKC, and guanylate kinase on T3 activation of a minimal promoter through various TREs. We show that activators of PKA (but not PKC or guanylate kinase) potentiated TR-mediated transcription in a cell-specific manner that was dependent on TR binding both to T3 and to the TRE. The DBD and LBD of the TR, but not the amino-terminal domain, were essential for synergy. The purified TR was phosphorylated by PKA in vitro, suggesting that TR phosphorylation may be involved in the cross-talk. Human promonocyte U937, human choriocarcinoma JEG-3, and mouse embryonal carcinoma F9 cell lines, RPMI 1640 medium, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin were obtained from the cell culture facility at University of California (San Francisco). Biobrene was purchased from Applied Biosystems. T3, forskolin, 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP), 8-bromo-cGMP (8-Br-cGMP), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and the protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) peptide and catalytic subunit of PKA were purchased from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol), [125I]T3 (2200 Ci/mmol), and [3H]acetyl-CoA (1.2 Ci/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN. A series of reporter genes were constructed by ligating double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a TRE into the polylinker upstream of the -32/+45 herpes simplex thymidine kinase (TK) promoter linked to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT)-coding sequences in a pUC19-based vector. DR4-TKCAT contains one or two copies of a direct repeat of the consensus TRE half-site spaced by 4 base pairs (5′-agcttcAGGTCAccagAGGTCAgag-3′). MHC-TKCAT contains one copy of the DR4-like TRE from the rat α-myosin heavy chain (-151/-124) (5′-agcttggctctggAGGTCAccagAGGACAgcg-3′). TREpal-TKCAT contains two copies of the consensus half-site unspaced and arranged as a palindrome (5′-atattcAGGTCATGACCTgaatat-3′). The reporter plasmids had a deletion of a putative AP-1-like site downstream of CAT-coding sequences previously reported to mediate nuclear receptor action (29Lopez G. Schaufele F. Webb P.

U937, F9, and JEG-3 cells were maintained and subcultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% newborn calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 µg/ml streptomycin. Transfection procedures were as described previously (42Leitman D.C. Ribeiro R.C.J. Mackow E.R. Baxter J.D. West B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9343-9346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected and resuspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (0.5 ml/1.5 × 107 cells) containing 0.1% dextrose, 10 µg/ml Biobrene, and typically 10 µg of reporter plasmid and 1 µg of expression vector. Cells were electroporated at 300 V and 960 microfarads, transferred to RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% stripped newborn calf serum, and then plated in 6-well plates. After incubation for 24 h at 37°C with ethanol, 10-100 nM T3, and/or 10 µM forskolin, the cells were collected, and the pellets were solubilized by the addition of 100 µl of 0.25 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Cellular lysates were assayed for CAT activity using the liquid scintillation method described previously (43Neumann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 444-447Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts of U937 cells treated for 24 h with forskolin or vehicle (ethanol) were prepared as described (42Leitman D.C. Ribeiro R.C.J. Mackow E.R. Baxter J.D. West B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9343-9346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and protein concentration was measured by Coomassie Blue staining. TR concentration in nuclear extracts was estimated by [125I]T3 binding assays (44Ribeiro R.C.J. Kushner P.J. Apriletti J.W. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1142-1152PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of the TR to DNA was studied by electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays as described previously (8Ribeiro R.C. Apriletti J.W. Yen P.M. Chin W.W. Baxter J.D. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2076-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 44Ribeiro R.C.J. Kushner P.J. Apriletti J.W. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1142-1152PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed hTRβ1 and rat TRα1 LBD were purified to homogeneity (>98% pure) employing procedures described previously (44Ribeiro R.C.J. Kushner P.J. Apriletti J.W. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1142-1152PubMed Google Scholar, 45Apriletti J.W. Baxter J.D. Lau K.H. West B.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). hTRβ1 (3 pmol) and rat TRα1 LBD (340 pmol) were added to a reaction mixture containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 100 µM ATP, 0.5 mM dithiothrietol, [γ-32P]ATP, and 2.5 µg of the catalytic subunit of PKA in the absence or presence of 2 µg of PKI in a final volume of 20 µl. We also produced 32P-phosphorylated and unlabeled phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated (by omitting PKA from the reaction) TRs for electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays by incubating hTRβ1 (1 pmol, 25% pure) in the presence or absence of [γ-32P]ATP. After the samples were incubated for 30 min at 30°C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 40 µl of 2 × SDS sample buffer containing 5%β-mercaptoethanol. The reaction products were examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The dried gel was then exposed to Kodak X-Omat x-ray film at -70°C. The effect of activators of PKA (forskolin and 8-Br-cAMP), PKC (TPA), and guanylate kinase (8-Br-cGMP) on T3 responses was examined in U937 cells by cotransfecting a DR4 (one copy)-TKCAT reporter plasmid with a plasmid expressing hTRβ1. Fig. 1A shows that forskolin, 8-Br-cAMP, TPA, and 8-Br-cGMP did not regulate DR4-TKCAT in the absence of T3, whereas T3 alone activated it by 10-fold. The activation of DR4-TKCAT by T3 was potentiated 2.5-fold by 8-Br-cAMP and 3-fold by forskolin, but was not affected by TPA and 8-Br-cGMP. T3, forskolin, or both did not activate the parental plasmid missing DR4, indicating that a TRE is essential for both T3 activation and synergy with forskolin (see Fig. 5). These results demonstrate that activators of PKA, but not of PKC or guanylate kinase, exert a synergistic effect on the T3/TR activation of DR4-TKCAT in U937 cells.Fig. 5Forskolin and T3 synergy occurs with multiple distinct TREs. U937 cells were cotransfected with 2.5 µg of hTRβ1 and 10 µg of reporter plasmid containing either one copy or two copies of DR4, two copies of TREpal, or one copy of the MHC TRE upstream of minimal TKCAT or enhancerless SV40CAT. Cells were treated with ethanol (control), 10 µM forskolin (F), 10 nM T3, or both T3 and forskolin (T3 + F) for 18 h and then assayed for CAT activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm that the effects of cAMP are mediated by PKA, a plasmid expressing either a native or a mutant inhibitor of PKA (PKI) was cotransfected with DR4-TKCAT and hTRβ1 into U937 cells. Fig. 1B shows that native PKI did not affect T3 activation, but markedly blunted the potentiation by forskolin. In contrast, mutant PKI, which does not inhibit PKA, did not block the forskolin potentiation of T3 activation. These studies demonstrate that the potentiation by forskolin is mediated by cAMP activation of PKA. Dose-response experiments showed that forskolin did not shift the T3 response curve, indicating that synergy is not due to increased affinity of the TR for T3 (data not shown). Furthermore, the synergy is not due to stimulation of the TR expression vector by forskolin since the number of TRs was similar in control or forskolin-treated U937 cells transfected with hTRβ1 (70.7 ± 6.9 versus 49.0 ± 19.3 fmol of TR/mg of protein for control and forskolin-treated cells, respectively; n = 3; p = 0.28 by Student's paired t test). Finally, TRs commonly form heterodimers with the RXR, and it is conceivable that T3 activation and synergy with forskolin may be augmented by cotransfection of RXRs. Table I shows that cotransfecting human RXRα with hTRβ1 in U937 cells did not alter T3 activation, but significantly enhanced the forskolin potentiation of T3 activation.TABLE I.RXRα augments the PKA potentiation of T3/TR-mediated transcriptionActivationSynergy indexFaF, forskolin.T3T3+ FT3+ F/T3-foldTR1.2 ± 0.110.2 ± 1.931.1 ± 3.83.5 ± 0.4TR + RXR1.5 ± 0.111.7 ± 3.147.7 ± 9.7bp = 0.05 compared with (T3+ forskolin) -fold activation of cells transfected with the TR alone.4.8 ± 0.6cp = 0.01 compared with the synergy index of cells transfected with the TR alone (Student's paired t test).a F, forskolin.b p = 0.05 compared with (T3+ forskolin) -fold activation of cells transfected with the TR alone.c p = 0.01 compared with the synergy index of cells transfected with the TR alone (Student's paired t test).

Acta. 1993; 1167: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that synergy between T3 and forskolin might differ among cell lines since the content of factors or substrates necessary for PKA action may be tissue-specific. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 2, we tested other cell types known to be responsive to the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. Whereas T3 activated hTRβ1-mediated transcription on DR4 (two copies)-TKCAT by ≈40-fold in JEG-3 cells and by ≈120-fold in F9 cells, the addition of forskolin did not alter the T3 stimulation. Identical studies in CV-1 monkey kidney, HeLa human cervical carcinoma, L929 mouse fibroblast, and HTC rat hepatocarcinoma cells also showed T3 activation, but no synergy between T3 and forskolin was observed (data not shown). CREB is a major target for PKA phosphorylation that is absent in F9 cells. To determine whether CREB mediates the synergy by T3 and forskolin in F9 cells, we cotransfected CREB with hTRβ1. Fig. 2 shows that CREB did not induce synergy in F9 cells, indicating that the lack of synergy is not due to CREB absence. Altogether, these results indicate that synergy between forskolin and T3 is cell-specific. We then tested whether cross-talk between PKA and T3 also occurs with other TR isoforms. Fig. 3 shows that in addition to hTRβ1, forskolin also potentiated the T3 activation of the hTRα1 isoform. In contrast to TRβ1 and TRα1 isoforms, the TRα2 and v-ErbA TR variants are not activated by T3 since they have abnormal LBDs that impair T3 binding. As expected, forskolin had no effects on cotransfected TRα2 and v-ErbA, indicating that TR LBD structure has to accommodate T3-induced structural changes for synergy to occur. To investigate which TR domains participate in forskolin potentiation of T3 transactivation, DR4-TKCAT was cotransfected with a plasmid expressing full-length TRβ1 (TTT), with TRβ1 with the amino-terminal domain deleted (ΔTT), or with a TR with the DBD deleted (TΔT). Stimulation of transcription by T3 and potentiation by forskolin were observed with TTT and ΔTT, but not with TΔT, which lacks the DBD (Fig. 4A). These results demonstrate that the amino-terminal transactivation domain does not participate in synergy, whereas deletion of the TR DBD impairs T3 stimulation and potentiation by forskolin, indicating that TR binding to the TRE is required for synergy. To explore further the role of the TR DBD, the cDNA sequences encoding the amino terminus of full-length TRβ1 were fused in frame to those encoding the DBD (amino acids 1-147) of the yeast GAL4 transactivator protein (GALTR expression vector). When GALTR was cotransfected with a reporter containing one copy of the GAL4 response element linked to minimal TKCAT, T3 stimulated CAT expression by 5-fold, but synergy was absent (Fig. 4B). In contrast, T3 stimulation and synergy with forskolin were observed when GALTR was cotransfected with DR4-TKCAT (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that direct binding of the TR DBD to TREs is required for synergy to occur, implying that DNA-induced allosteric changes in TR conformation are necessary for cross-talk with PKA. Our results demonstrate that synergy requires binding of the TR to DR4. However, the TR can bind other TREs, adopting diverse conformations depending on the orientation and spacing of TRE half-sites. We examined whether synergy depends on specific TR conformations by cotransfecting hTRβ1 with various TRE-TKCAT plasmids. Fig. 5 shows that T3 stimulated transcription from all TREs tested. The plasmid containing two copies of DR4 was stimulated the most by T3, producing a ≈100-fold increase in transcription as compared with ≈10-fold on one copy of DR4 and much greater than observed with two copies of TREpal (≈6-fold). Whereas the magnitude of activation was different with T3 alone, the potentiation by forskolin was ~3-fold in each TRE-TKCAT construct, demonstrating that synergy occurs independent of the diverse conformations adopted by TRs when bound to TREs with half-sites positioned in different orientations and spacing. We also addressed whether the synergy depends on promoter context by substituting the TK promoter with the enhancerless SV40 early promoter (46Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar) on the DR4-TKCAT plasmid. Fig. 5 shows that forskolin also potentiated the T3 stimulation of DR4-SV40CAT, demonstrating that the synergy is not dependent on promoter context. Although a number of different proteins participating in the T3 transactivation pathway may be a target for PKA, the most likely candidate is the TR because the synergy requires direct binding of the TR to T3 and to the TRE, and prior reports showed that PKA phosphorylates the progesterone receptor and RAR, modulating their transcriptional influences (17Rochette-Egly C. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Staub A. Pfister V. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Gaub M.-P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 860-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Denner L.A. Weigel N.L. Maxwell B.L. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1990; 250: 1740-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). To determine if hTRβ1 is phosphorylated by PKA in vitro, purified unliganded bacterially expressed hTRβ1 was incubated with PKA and [32P]ATP in the absence or presence of PKI. As shown in the autoradiograph obtained by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in Fig. 6A, PKA phosphorylation of a 98% pure hTRβ1 preparation resulted in two 32P-labeled bands of 52 and 46 kDa (second lane), which correspond to the molecular size of hTRβ1. These bands were abolished by PKI (first lane), but the addition of T3 did not change the phosphorylation pattern (data not shown). A similar pattern was obtained by phosphorylating this TR preparation using HeLa cell cytosolic kinases (47Sugawara A. Yen P.M. Apriletti J.W. Ribeiro R.C.J. Sacks D.B. Baxter J.D. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 433-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, PKA did not phosphorylate the LBD fragment of rat TRα1 purified to homogeneity (>99% pure) in the presence or absence of PKI (fifth and sixth lanes), nor the LBD fragment of hTRβ1 (data not shown). In parallel experiments, PKA phosphorylated bovine serum albumin (fourth lane), but not ovalbumin (third lane), demonstrating the specificity of PKA. TR phosphorylation by HeLa cell cytosolic kinases enhances binding of TRs to DNA (47Sugawara A. Yen P.M. Apriletti J.W. Ribeiro R.C.J. Sacks D.B. Baxter J.D. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 433-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Bhat M.K. Ashizawa K. Cheng S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7927-7931Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, we compared binding of nonphosphorylated and PKA-phosphorylated TRs to DR4 using gel mobility shift assays. Fig. 6B shows that, in the absence of T3, no difference in DNA binding was observed between PKA-phosphorylated hTRβ1 and nonphosphorylated hTRβ1 as homodimers (lanes 1 and 2) or heterodimers with the RXR (lanes 3 and 4). The addition of T3 did not alter heterodimeric binding of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated TRs (lanes 5 and 6), but disrupted their homodimeric binding (lanes 7 and 8). As a control, Fig. 6C shows that PKA-phosphorylated 32P-labeled TRs bind to nonradioactive DR4 as homodimers (lane 1), and the addition of T3 disrupts them (lane 2). These results demonstrate that TRs are phosphorylated by PKA and that the DNA binding properties of PKA-phosphorylated TRs remain similar to those of nonphosphorylated TRs. Although several reports have examined interactions between nuclear receptors and second messenger systems, no studies have addressed the influences of second messenger systems on T3/TR/TRE-mediated transcription. This study demonstrates that activators of PKA, but not of PKC or guanylate kinase, potentiate T3 effects on transcription in U937 cells on a promoter activated by TR binding to the TRE. The effects of PKA activation are synergistic with T3 because it required a TR bound to a TRE and no effects occurred in the absence of T3. The PKA potentiation of the TR was not dependent on the type of TRE structure since it occurred with direct repeats (DR4 and MHC), a palindrome (TREpal), and an inverted palindrome (F2) (data not shown). However, the presence of a functional TRE is essential for synergy since the parental plasmid lacking a TRE showed no T3 response or PKA effects. The observation that TΔT, the TR mutant missing the DBD, does not confer synergy also confirms that TR binding to the TRE is essential. Furthermore, when GALTR was cotransfected with a GAL-TKCAT reporter plasmid, the T3 response was retained, but the synergy was abolished. However, synergy occurred when GALTR was cotransfected with DR4-TKCAT. These results indicate that the T3·TR complex assumes a conformation bound to a GAL-binding site that does not permit interaction with other factors that can occur when it is bound to a TRE, implying that TRE structure can allosterically influence TR function. In addition to TR binding to the TRE, synergy requires T3 binding to the TR since no synergy was observed using TR isoforms with mutations in the TR LBD that render it incapable of binding T3. The finding that deletion of the TR amino terminus does not impair synergy indicates that transactivation properties residing in the amino terminus do not play a role in the TR/PKA cross-talk. Consistent with this finding, synergy occurred with TRβ1 and TRα1, TR isoforms with a divergent amino terminus. Thus, allosteric changes induced by T3 and DNA binding on the LBD and DBD are essential for synergy, presumably by facilitating PKA action on the TR and/or TR-associated proteins. In this regard, we found that the RXR, which heterodimerizes with the TR, is phosphorylated by PKA in vitro (data not shown) and significantly enhances the forskolin potentiation of T3 response, supporting the notion that non-TR factors are involved in the cross-talk between PKA and the TR. A unique aspect of the T3 and PKA synergy is its cell specificity, occurring in U937 cells, but not in F9, JEG-3, CV-1, HeLa, L929, and HTC cells (Fig. 2 and data not shown). By contrast, PKA synergy with the RAR and glucocorticoid, estrogen, and progesterone receptors occurs in various cell lines (11Cho H. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol.

Science. 1990; 250: 1740-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). These results indicate that U937 cells possess factors that are activated by PKA, which may be absent in other cell types that are responsive to T3. One potential factor is CREB since it is phosphorylated by PKA and is absent in F9 cells (14Rangarajan P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that the lack of synergism between the TR and PKA in F9 and other cell types is due to the absence of CREB since cotransfection of CREB with the TR in F9 cells did not lead to synergy. The RXR is also unlikely to play a role in the cell-specific nature of synergy since it is present in cell types in which no synergy was observed (7Sugawara A. Yen P.M. Darling D.S. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that U937-specific factors are necessary for synergy, and thus, these cells may provide a useful model to identify and characterize potential cell-specific factors that participate in the cross-talk between PKA and the TR. In addition to cell-specific factors, other potential targets for PKA that may participate in synergy that are not cell-specific include the TR. Previous studies indicated that phosphorylation of the TR may lead to increased transcriptional activity since treatment of cells with okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor that augments the phosphorylation status of TRs in cells, stimulates transcription (49Jones K.E. Brubaker J.H. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 50Lin K.H. Ashizawa K. Cheng S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7737-7741Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We did find that PKA efficiently phosphorylates the full-length TR, but not the TR LBD in vitro. These results, combined with those suggesting that the TRE allosterically influences the TR DBD, which is essential for synergy, are consistent with the notion that the TR DBD may be a target for PKA action. However, there are no consensus sites for PKA phosphorylation in the DBD, and further studies will be required to localize the TR sites phosphorylated by PKA. Other studies with the glucocorticoid receptor (14Rangarajan P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) suggested that the synergy may be due in part to enhanced DNA binding of the PKA-phosphorylated TR. However, it is unlikely that increased binding of the PKA-phosphorylated TR accounts for synergy since no difference in DNA binding was observed when the phosphorylated TR was compared with the nonphosphorylated TR. The requirements for TR/PKA synergy also differ from those of other nuclear receptors in that it occurs only in the liganded state, whereas other studies found that PKA activates the unliganded progesterone, vitamin D, and estrogen receptors and RAR, mimicking the transcriptional effects of their cognate ligands (18Denner L.A.

Our TRE-TKCAT reporter plasmids have a deletion of an AP-1-like regulatory site found in the backbone of the pUC plasmid (33Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Duncan K.G. Lopez G.N. Schaufele F. Uht R.M. Webb P. West B.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 405-407PubMed Google Scholar); this site in TRE-TKCAT constructs conveyed forskolin activation to unliganded TRs (data not shown). In fact, we previously reported that unliganded TRs synergize with an AP-1 complex at this element (29Lopez G. Schaufele F. Webb P. Holloway J.M. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3042-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that activation of unliganded receptors found in some studies may be due to the presence of AP-1-like sites in the reporter plasmids. We have shown that PKA signaling augments TR transcriptional properties in a cell-specific manner, indicating that such cross-talk depends on factors other than the TR and PKA. Also, we show that allosteric influences on TR structure exerted by T3 and by the TRE are required for synergy. Whether TR/PKA cross-talk requires phosphorylation of the TR, RXR, or coactivators is not yet resolved. We show that the TR is a target for PKA in vitro, but further studies will be needed to define the sites and role of TR phosphorylation, if any, in the synergy. Our results indicate that TR cross-talk with PKA may explain some tissue-specific actions of thyroid hormones and provide a system to identify cell-specific factors involved in T3/TR-mediated transcription.

Granulosa cells form an avascular compartment in the ovarian follicle, in which a heparin-like activity has been described. At ovulation extravascular coagulation occurs around ovulatory follicles, and after expulsion of the oocyte, a fibrin clot forms in the antral cavity. Granulosa cells synthesize two major heparan sulfate proteoglycans, whose anticoagulant nature has not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to characterize anticoagulant heparan sulfate proteoglycans synthesized by rat ovarian granulosa cells. Affinity purified 35S-labeled anticoagulant heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans represent 6.5% of the total heparan sulfate synthesized, and they contain 13% 3-O-sulfated disaccharides that are markers of the antithrombin-binding site of heparin. The biological activity of granulosa cell heparan sulfate proteoglycans was demonstrated by their ability to bind antithrombin and to accelerate the formation of thrombin-antithrombin complexes. The impact of hormonal stimulation on granulosa cell anticoagulant heparan sulfate proteoglycans was studied using 125I-antithrombin binding assays. Folliclestimulating hormone induced a redistribution of anticoagulant heparan sulfate proteoglycans from the granulosa cell layer to the culture medium, indicating that their distribution could be modulated according to the stage of follicular development. These results suggest that anticoagulant heparan sulfate might be critically located in the follicle to maintain fluidity around the oocyte until its expulsion at ovulation."

Primary transcriptional start sites were identified at positions +1 and -4. Deletion of the upstream activator elements APBβ and APBα did not affect the selection of transcriptional start sites, although total transcriptional activity was reduced both in vitro and in vivo. Mutations within the initiator element shifted the transcriptional start sites and reduced transcriptional activity. Mutations between positions -6 and -35 changed the relative utilization of start sites +1 and -4 without affecting the total level of transcriptional activity. A 10-base pair deletion between position -40 and -31 increased in vitro transcriptional activity with a preeminent utilization of the start site at position -4. In contrast, a 20-base pair deletion between position -40 and -21 resulted in a reduction in transcriptional activity and in the primary utilization of the start site at position +1. Furthermore, transactivation by APBβ and APBα was eliminated. DNase I footprinting provided evidence for the existence of two binding domains designated UE (position -12 to -30) and Inr (position +7 to -7). The positions of these binding domains are altered in mutations and deletions that affect transcriptional activity."

In the absence of external Ca2+, such oscillations were maintained for prolonged periods of time, but their frequency was significantly reduced (0.23 min-1 versus 0.38 min-1). Restoration of [Ca2+]o to 0.6 mM increased the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations in cells that showed narrow spikes of constant amplitude and caused a plateau response in cells with broad spikes of rapidly decreasing amplitude. In the presence of Ca2+, nifedipine reduced the frequency of the oscillatory Ca2+ response to 100 pM Ang II by 49%, and BAY K 8644 increased oscillation frequency by 86%, or caused plateau-type responses typical of higher Ang II concentrations.

Constitutive expression of Gsα blocks the ability of dexamethasone and methylisobutylxanthine (DEX+MIX) to induce adipogenesis, whereas expression of Giα2 itself induces adipogenesis in the absence of DEX+MIX. The strategy adopted to identify the domain(s) controlling adipogenesis was to express chimeras of Gsα and Giα2 and to evaluate their influence on adipogenesis in both the absence and presence of inducers. Chimeras with variable N-terminal substitution of Giα2 for Gsα, a C-terminal 38-residue substitution of Giα2 for Gsα, a C-terminal truncation of Gsα lacking 38 residues, and constitutively activated mutants of Gsα and Giα2 with diminished intrinsic GTPase activities were prepared and used to stably transfect 3T3-L1 cell cultures (Fig. 1). Stably transfected clones harboring the neomycin resistance gene were selected in the neomycin analog G418 and examined for G-protein subunit expression by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2A). In the absence of the primary (-1st Ab) or secondary (-2nd Ab) antibodies, no epifluorescence signal was detected. Immunostaining with a primary antibody raised against the C-terminal decapeptide of Giα2 (CM-112) revealed faint staining of endogenous subunits in the cultures transfected with an empty expression vector alone, pCW1. Cultures stably transfected with pCW1 harboring the Gsα(356)/Giα2 chimera displayed a strong epifluorescence signal following staining with the anti-Giα2 antibodies. Expression of the Giα2(122)/Gsα and Giα2(212)/Gsα chimera, the Q227L constitutively activated mutant of Gsα, and Gsα itself was established by staining the cultures with anti-Gsα antibody (CM-129) raised against the C-terminal decapeptide of the G-protein subunit (Fig. 2B). Expression of the C-terminal truncated mutant of Gsα was established by staining with antibodies raised against the holoprotein rGsα (CM-474). Immunoblotting of crude cell extracts confirmed these results, obtained by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 2C, a-c). Expression of G-protein α subunits in the stable transfectant clones was approximately 1.5-fold over endogenous Gsα levels. As shown earlier (Wang et al., 23Wang H.- Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), endogenous levels of Gsα decline during differentiation in response to DEX+MIX, whereas levels of the vector-driven expression of α subunits remains relatively constant (Fig. 2C, d). In wild-type cells and cells stably transfected with the empty expression vector, no differentiation was observed in the absence of the inducers DEX+MIX, as detected by staining for lipid with oil red O (Fig. 3). Nuclei were made visible by counterstaining with hematoxylin. When exposed to DEX+MIX, cultures displayed nearly complete differentiation, as typified by lipid accumulation, the hallmark of adipocytes. Cultures stably transfected with the empty vector alone displayed robust differentiation in response to DEX+MIX also. Expression of either wild-type Gsα or the GTPase-deficient, activated Q227L mutant of Gsα resulted in cultures that failed to respond to DEX+MIX, unable to differentiate into adipocytes. Much like the short term effects of cholera toxin activating Gsα (Wang et al., 23Wang H.- Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), stable expression of Gsα blocks adipogenesis. The role of the N-terminal domain of Gsα was analyzed using a series of chimeras with increasing degree of substitution with Giα2 (Fig. 1). N-terminal substitutions of Gsα to residue 145 with analogous regions of Giα2 were largely unremarkable (Fig. 4). Stable expression of the Giα2(122)/Gsα chimera or the Giα2(54)/Gsα chimera (not shown) effectively blocked the ability of the inducers to provoke adipogenesis, much like constitutive expression of Gsα. When the region of Giα2 substitution for Gsα increased from 122 to 212, corresponding to region 145-235 in Gsα, the phenotype changed dramatically. Whereas expression of Gsα or chimeras with N-terminal substitutions to 145 blocked DEX+MIX-induced adipogenesis, expression of Giα2(212)/Gsα chimera no longer blocked adipogenesis, relieving the repression of differentiation by Gsα, much like oligodeoxynucleotides antisense to Gsα (Wang et al., 23Wang H.- Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Constitutively expressed Giα2 provoked adipogenesis in either the absence or presence of the inducers, whereas expression of the Giα2(212)/Gsα chimera does not induce adipogenesis in the absence of DEX+MIX. Thus, it is not the presence of the additional region of Giα2 but, rather, the loss of the corresponding region of Gsα that ablates the block of differentiation. The role of the C-terminal domain of Gsα was explored through comparison of the effects of wild-type compared with a mutant of Gsα in which the C-terminal 38 residues have been removed. As shown in Fig. 5, constitutive expression of either the wild-type or truncated version of Gsα blocks the ability of DEX+MIX to induce adipogenesis. Although these data suggest no major role of the C-terminal 38 residues in the ability of Gsα to repress adipogenesis, expression of a chimera in which the C-terminal 38 residues of Gsα (356-394) are replaced with the analogous region of Giα2 (320-355) reveal a more complex picture. Expression of the Gsα(356)/Giα2 chimera itself does not induce adipogenesis but does derepress the block of adipogenesis in response to DEX+MIX in 20-25% of the culture. Examination of the cultures for 4-10 days after induction reveals this rather constant percentage of the cells progressing to adipocytes when the Gsα(356)/Giα2 chimera is stably expressed. aP2 is an early marker expressed when the embryonic fibroblasts commit to the adipocyte phenotype. In the 3T3-L1 cells, the expression of aP2 mRNA was analyzed by RNA blotting (Fig. 6A). Within 48 h of exposure to DEX+MIX, aP2 mRNA expression increases dramatically. By day 3, aP2 mRNA levels have peaked and are sustained in the mature phenotype. The expression of this early marker for differentiation was analyzed in cells stably expressing the chimera and mutant forms of Gsα and Giα2 (Fig. 6B). Expression of Gsα, two GTPase-deficient mutants of Gsα (G225T and Q227L), the Giα2(122)/Gsα chimera, and Gsα with the truncated C terminus all displayed no significant induction of aP2 mRNA in response to DEX+MIX. Expression of the Giα2(212)/Gsα and Gsα(356)/Giα2 chimeras, in sharp contrast, removed the block of DEX+MIX-induced adipogenesis caused by Gsα, as depicted by the dramatic increase in aP2 mRNA. The extent of differentiation was quantified by scoring either positive or negative for lipid accumulation individual cells in large fields from cultures treated with DEX+MIX and stained with oil red O (Fig. 7). The results show dramatically that constitutive expression of Gsα, its activated mutants, or the C-terminal truncate effectively represses the induction of adipogenesis by DEX+MIX. Expression of Giα2 or its GTPase-deficient, activated mutant, in contrast, provoked adipogenesis, even in the absence of DEX+MIX (Fig. 4). The ability of Gsα to repress adipogenesis is not diminished by substitution of its N-terminal 145 residues with the analogous 122 N-terminal region of Giα2. Further extension of the substitution from 145 to residue 235 of Gsα with Giα2 largely relieves the block of adipogenesis caused by Gsα, identifying the intervening region as a primary repressor of adipogenesis. The C-terminal truncate (Gsα(1-356)) represses adipogenesis as well as full-length Gsα. Addition of the C-terminal region of Giα2 to the Gsα truncate resulted in a modest derepression of induction of adipogenesis by DEX+MIX. To define further the nature of the repressor domain of Gsα for adipogenesis, additional chimeras were constructed and stably expressed in the 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 8A). Because expression of Gsα(1-394), Gsα(235)/Giα2, and Giα2(122)/Gsα chimeras blocks adipogenesis in response to inducers, but Giα2(212)/Gsα does not, we explored whether the 145-235 region of Gsα embedded within Giα2 would repress or permit induction of adipogenesis. As shown by oil red O staining of the clones (Fig. 8B), expression of the Giα2(122)/Gsα(235)/Giα2 chimera suppresses the adipogenic response to DEX+MIX. Expression of the Giα2(212)/Gsα chimera devoid of the 145-235 region permits a robust adipogenic response, as made more clear by color (Fig. 8B) compared with black-and-white (Fig. 4) images of the oil red O staining. The fact that expression of the Gsα(235)/Giα2 chimera fully represses DEX+MIX-induced adipogenesis suggests no simple interpretation of the inability of the Gsα(356)/Giα2 to block adipogenesis completely (Fig. 7). G-proteins now are recognized as critical elements in a variety of complex biological processes. G-proteins have been shown to be key regulators of oncogenesis (Pace, et al., 15Pace A.M. Wong Y.H.

Activating mutants of Gsα and Giα2 are associated with a number of cancers arising in endocrine tissues such as the thyroid, pituitary, and ovary (Landis et al., 12Landis C.A. Masters S.B. Spada A.

In neonatal development, targeted elimination of Giα2 in liver and adipose tissue at birth generates transgenic mice with a runted phenotype (Moxham et al., 14Moxham C.M. Hod Y. Malbon C.C. Science. 1993; 260: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In early mouse development, probed in totipotent mouse F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells, the morphogen retinoic acid induces a sharp reduction in Giα2 as the cells commit to primitive endoderm (Galvin-Parton et al., 4Galvin-Parton P.A. Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17771-17774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Suppression of Giα2 by constitutive expression of RNA antisense to Giα2 mRNA mimics the decline observed in response to retinoic acid and induces differentiation to primitive endoderm in the absence of the morphogen (Gao and Malbon, 5Gao P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 embryonic fibroblasts are a useful model of cellular differentiation, in which inducers such as dexamethasone in combination with methylisobutylxanthine promote a highly differentiated state in which the cells accumulate lipid. The adipocyte phenotype requires the activation of an array of genes necessary for lipid synthesis. The capacity to stain the cells for lipid with oil red O provides a facile determination of differentiation. Earlier it was shown that cholera toxin activation of Gsα effectively blocks induced differentiation and that Gsα levels decline precipitously during induced differentiation (Wang et al., 23Wang H.- Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Oligodeoxynucleotides antisense, but not sense or missense, to Gsα mimicked the decline in Gsα and the adipogenic conversion of the cultures (Wang et al., 23Wang H.- Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Exploitation of the antagonistic Gsα/Giα2 axis shown for adenylyl cyclase revealed that overexpression of Giα2 as well as the constitutively active Q205L mutant of Giα2 would also induce differentiation in the absence of dexamethasone and methylisobutylxanthine (Su et al., 20Su H.-L. Malbon C.C. Wang H.- Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1729-C1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these data would provide support for an intimate role of adenylyl cyclase and cAMP in this process, this is not the case. Elevation of intracellular cAMP levels by pertussis toxin, forskolin, or addition of the dibutyryl or chlorophenylthio derivatives of cAMP fail to affect adipogenesis (Wang et al., 23Wang H.- Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These data implicate some effector other than adenylyl cyclase in the control of adipogenesis (Wang and Malbon, 22Wang H.- Malbon C.C. Int. J. Obes. 1996; 20: 26-31PubMed Google Scholar). The Gsα/Giα2 axis controlling adipogenesis was exploited in the current work to identify regions of the Gsα molecule that are involved in this regulation. Expression of wild-type Gsα effectively blocks the induction of differentiation. Constitutively active mutants of Gsα G225T and Q227L both blocked the ability of dexamethasone and methylisobutylxanthine to induce differentiation. Thus, constitutively active mutants of Gsα block and those of Giα2 induce differentiation. Mutations of this nature have been associated with tumorigenesis of several endocrine tissues (Bourne, et al., 1990). Substitution of sequences of the N terminus of Gsα with analogous ones of Giα2 proved revealing with respect to the domain(s) involved in controlling adipogenesis. Whereas substitution of the N-terminal 145 amino acids of Gsα with the first 122 amino acids of Giα2 produced no obvious effects on the ability of chimera to suppress differentiation, substitution of the N-terminal 235 residues of Gsα with the first 212 residues of Giα2 had a profound effect. Expression of the Giα2(212)/Gsα construct abolishes the ability of the chimera to suppress induction of adipogenesis in response to DEX+MIX, whereas expression of a chimera in which the Gsα146-235 region is embedded in Giα2 effectively blocks DEX+MIX-induced adipogenesis. These data clearly demarcate region 146-235 of Gsα as critical to its ability to repress adipogenesis. Careful comparison of the aligned protein sequences of Gsα and Giα2 reveals the control domain to be restricted to region 146-220, as the 221-235 region of Gsα includes only one conservative substitution (R231K) and one nonconservative substitution (D229S). Analysis by mutagenesis revealed that this (D229S) substitution is not critical to repressor activity (not shown). Analysis of the C-terminal region of Gsα was approached using truncation of the final 38 residues, which in this model of differentiation had equal capability as full-length Gsα or constitutively activated Gsα mutants to suppress 3T3-L1 cell differentiation. Interestingly, the substitution of the C-terminal 36 residues of Giα2 for the corresponding 38 residues of Gsα, chimera Gsα(356)/Giα2, resulted in a small, but significant, release from the repression observed with constitutive expression of native Gsα or the truncated 1-356 version. The ability of the Gsα(235)/Giα2 chimera to fully repress the adipogenic response suggests that the effects of the Gsα(356)/Giα2 chimera are not simply related to substitution of the Giα2 sequence into the C terminus of Gsα. With structural features of the α subunits of several heterotrimeric G-proteins deduced from x-ray diffraction, it is now possible to speculate as to the regions of Gsα involved in effector regulation (Lambright et al., 11Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Projections of Gsα and Giα2 sequences on the deduced structure of the GTP-liganded form of Giα1 (Coleman et al., 3Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar) (red) were used to identify the regions implicated in the control of adenylyl cyclase (yellow) in the space-filling model displayed in Fig. 9. The GTP molecule is rendered in white. Highlighted in blue is the region of Giα2(122-212), which is corresponding to the amino acid sequence 145-235 of Gsα, shown to be critical to the ability of the chimera to repress adipogenesis. Interestingly, this region of Gsα includes switch domains I and II (green), but not III (cyan), which change conformation on activation of the molecule by GTP binding. The colorization of the sequences displays not only the overlap of the control domain with switches I and II, but also the spatial separation of the domain from that implicated in adenylyl cyclase regulation. It is the loss of the controlling domain of Gsα or the addition of the analogous region of Giα2 that is responsible for the effects on adipogenesis? The fact that expression of native or constitutively active Giα2 induces differentiation in the absence of dexamethasone and methylisobutylxanthine (Su et al., 20Su H.-L. Malbon C.C. Wang H.- Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1729-C1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the inability of the Giα2(212)/s chimera to alter differentiation in the absence of the inducers, suggests the former rather than the latter interpretation. Thus, we have identified a domain of Gsα requisite for regulation of adipogenesis as separate and distinct from those controlling adenylyl cyclase, consistent with the inability of cAMP to influence this differentiation process (Wang and Malbon, 22Wang H.- Malbon C.C. Int. J. Obes. 1996; 20: 26-31PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of the region controlling adipogenesis provides the boundaries for more detailed mutagenesis and a basis from which to initiate the search for the effector(s) through which Gsα exerts its control of adipogenesis.

The structure of this helix has been examined in greater detail in this study. A total of 46 substitution and 8 insertional mutants were constructed and analyzed along the entire length of transmembrane helix 10. The results identified amino acids that are tolerant of substitutions by a variety of amino acids. Since a number of these amino acids (Thr-320, Val-331, Phe-325, and Ile-317) are clustered in one region in a helical wheel projection of transmembrane helix 10, it seems likely that this face of helix 10 is interacting with the membrane. The channel lining domain is thought to consist of the helical face containing Glu-325, Leu-318, Leu-329, His-322, Val-315, Cys-333, Val-326, and Lys-319 based on the results here and from earlier findings. Deleterious mutations along this face tended to greatly increase the Km value for lactose transport with only minor effects on the Vmax. Analysis of insertional mutants revealed that perturbation of the spatial relationship between amino acids at the periplasmic edge is less deleterious than perturbation in the center of the helix or the cytoplasmic edge.

In these organisms, the transport of substrates such as sugars, amino acids, antibiotics, etc. is often coupled to the transport of a cation such as H+, Na+, or Li+ and this cotransport is mediated by membrane embedded proteins. Energetically, cotransport is accomplished by an inwardly directed cation electrochemical gradient that acts as the driving force for the transport of the substrate so that secondary active transport can be achieved with regard to the solute (9Crane R.K.

Functionally, they transport a wide variety of substrates including sugars, amino acids, antibiotics, and Kreb's cycle intermediates. Most of the transporters are thought to contain 12 transmembrane α-helices traversing the membrane (21Maiden M.C.J. Davis E.O. Baldwin S.A. Moore D.C.M. Henderson P.J.F. Nature. 1987; 325: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). More recently, we have conducted a structural comparison of 65 members of the superfamily (22Goswitz V.C. Brooker R.J.

Based on a number of parameters, including hydropathicity, amphipathicity, interhelical loop length, and putative helical interactions in the lactose permease, we proposed a general, three-dimensional arrangement for all 12 transmembrane helices in the superfamily. In the lactose permease of E. coli, transmembrane helix 10 has been implicated to contain a number of functionally important amino acids (23Brooker R.J. Wilson T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lys-319 and His-322 have been shown to affect proton leakiness and coupling. In addition, changes in sugar specificity of the lactose permease can be attributed to mutations in transmembrane helix 10. Therefore, we have decided to examine the structure of transmembrane helix 10 in greater detail. Based on our model concerning the three-dimensional arrangement of transmembrane segment, helix 10 contains a putative channel lining face and a lipid bilayer interacting face. The model also predicts two sections of the helix that potentially interact with other helices (22Goswitz V.C. Brooker R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Previously, Hinkle et al. (29Hinkle P.C. Hinkle P.V. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10989-10994Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) examined transmembrane helix 8 of the lactose permease of E. coli for mutability. Analysis of functional single and multiple mutations in transmembrane helix 8 suggested a “mutable stripe” that was thought to be in contact with the membrane phospholipids. We used a similar approach in this study. A number of high and low activity single site substitution mutants were isolated along the entire length of transmembrane helix 10. In addition, we examined the importance of the spatial relationship between the amino acids in transmembrane helix 10. A number of insertional mutants were constructed in which a hydrophobic amino acid was inserted at various positions along the length of transmembrane helix 10. Based on the analyses of all these mutants, we propose a more detailed model of transmembrane helix 10. Lactose (O-β-D-galactopyranosyl-[1,4]-α-D-glucopyranose) was purchased from Sigma.

Open table in a new tab Plasmid DNA was isolated by using the plasmid isolation kit purchased from 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc. DNA fragments were isolated from 1% agarose gels using the gel extraction kit from Qiagen. Plasmid DNA was introduced into the appropriate bacterial strain by the CaCl2 transformation procedure of Mandel and Higa (30Mandel M. Higa A. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 63: 154-162Google Scholar). Stock cultures of cells were grown in YT media (31Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 433Google Scholar) supplemented with tetracycline (0.01 mg/ml) or ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml). For transport assays, cells were grown to midlog phase in YT media containing tetracycline (0.005 mg/ml) or ampicillin (0.05 mg/ml) and 0.25 mM isopropylthiogalactoside to induce the synthesis of the lactose permease. The plasmid, pTE18 (32Teather R.M. Bramhall H. Riede I. Wright J.K. Furst M. Aichele G. Wilhelm U. Overath P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 108: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), was digested with EcoRI to yield a 2300-base pair fragment containing the entire lacY gene. This fragment was ligated to the vector M13mp18 (33Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira H. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar) in such a way that the antisense strand of the lacY gene was colinear with the plus-strand of the viral DNA. Site-directed mutagenesis was then performed by the method Zoller and Smith (34Zoller M.J. Smith M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 468-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) as modified by Kunkel et al. (35Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zabour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) using the oligonucleotide primers that produced the desired mutation. Clones containing the mutation were identified by DNA sequencing (see below). The double-stranded replicative form DNA was then isolated and digested with EcoRI to produce the 2300-base pair fragment containing the lacY gene. This fragment was ligated into the EcoRI site of either pBR322 or pACYC184. Positive hybrid clones into pBR322 were identified on 1% lactose MacConkey plates containing ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml) and tetracycline (0.01 mg/ml). The hybrid clones were restriction mapped to verify the orientation of the lacY gene on the plasmid. Only those clones that contained the lacY gene and the ampicillin resistance gene in the same transcriptional direction were used. (Note: this is the same orientation as parent plasmid, pTE18.) Positive clones into pACYC184 were identified by selecting for tetracycline resistance followed by screening for the loss of chloramphenicol resistance. Only those clones that contained the lacY gene and the tetracycline resistance gene in the opposite transcriptional direction were used. (Note: this is the same orientation as parent plasmid, pLac184.) Finally, the mutant plasmids were sequenced throughout the entire lacY coding sequence to verify the presence of the mutation and to be certain that no other secondary mutations had occurred. At least two independent clones for each mutant type were saved for further study. Single-stranded viral DNA was sequenced by the Sanger dideoxy method (36Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52746) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotide primers that anneal within the lacY gene. Double-stranded plasmid DNA was isolated and sequenced as described by Kraft et al. (37Kraft R. Tardiff J. Drauter K.S. Leinwand L.A. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 544-547PubMed Google Scholar) Midlog cells were washed in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 60 mM K2HPO4 and 40 mM KH2PO4 and resuspended in the same buffer to a density of approximately 0.5 mg of protein/ml. Cells were then equilibrated at 30°C and radioactive sugar (final concentration = 0.1 mM) was added. At appropriate time intervals, 0.2-ml aliquots were withdrawn and filtered over a membrane filter (pore size, 0.45 uM). The external medium was then washed away with 5-10 ml of phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, by rapid filtration. 10 mM HgCl2 was included in the wash buffer during uphill transport experiments to rapidly inhibit the lactose permease and thereby minimize sugar efflux during removal of the extracellular medium. At 1-min time points, the activity of mutants was compared to the activity of the wild-type. Activity of the mutants that were cloned into pACYC184 was compared to the activity of the wild-type lactose permease cloned into pACYC184 (pLac184). Similarly, activity of the mutants that were cloned into pBR322 was compared to the activity of the wild-type lactose permease cloned into pBR322 (pTE18). For the kinetic experiments, the same procedure for downhill transport was followed but several different final sugar concentrations were used to evaluate the Km and Vmax values. The Km and Vmax values for lactose transport were determined by plotting 1/V verses 1/[S] in a Lineweaver-Burke double-reciprocal plot (38Segal I. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley and Interscience, New York1975Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, MS1019 cells containing the appropriate plasmid were grown as described for the sugar transport assays. 10 ml of late log cells were pelleted by low speed centrifugation, quick frozen in liquid N2, and thawed at room temperature. Cells were resuspended in 800 µl of MTPBS (150 mM NaCl, 16 mM Na2HPO4, 4 mM NaH2PO4). Cells were quick frozen in liquid N2 and thawed twice. Cells were then sonicated three times for 20 s each. The membranes were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 µl of MTPBS. 100 µg of total membrane protein was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose and then probed using an antibody that recognizes the carboxyl terminus of the lactose permease (graciously provided by Dr. Tom Wilson of Harvard University). The amount of lactose permease was then determined by laser densitometry. The plasmid, pASTM10, used for cassette mutagenesis was derived from pLac184. Plasmid pLac184 is a low copy plasmid derived from pACYC184 with a 2300-base pair fragment containing the entire lacY gene cloned into the EcoRI site. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described above to construct two unique restriction sites flanking the transmembrane helix 10 sequence of the lacY gene. An AatII restriction site was constructed at the 5′ end of the sequence encoding transmembrane helix 10 and an SpeI site at the 3′ end. In order to construct the AatII site, the mutagenic primer, 5′-ctt cca gcg ctg acg tcg cga acg atg agc-3′, was used. This primer has two base mismatches at Ala-309 and Thr-310. The two mismatches create a AatII site but conserve the wild-type amino acid sequence. Similarly, the SpeI mutagenic primer, 5′-ctt caa act gac tag taa tat att taa agc cc-3′, has two base mismatches at Thr-338 and Ser-339. In this case the mismatches create an SpeI site but also conserve the wild-type amino acid sequence. The two restriction sites were generated independently of each other and the plasmids referred to as pAat310 and pSpe339. In order to construct pASTM10, plasmids pAat310 and pSpe339 were digested with BamHI and NdeI. There is a unique NdeI restriction site in the middle of transmembrane helix 10. The resulting 3542-base pair fragment from pAat310 was ligated with the 3087-base pair fragment from pSpe339 to generate pASTM10. Another plasmid, pASTM10-kan, was constructed by cloning a 2.7-kilobase pair kanamycin cartridge into the NdeI site present in the middle of TM10. It was advantageous to use pASTM10-kan in the cassette mutagenesis protocol because any incompletely digested vector (9.3 kilobase pairs) could easily be separated from the completely digested plasmid (6.6 kilobase pairs). By removing the incompletely digested vector, the number of background red colonies derived from incompletely digested vector was minimized. Thus, most of the colonies on the transformation plate contained TM-10 that originated from the synthetic oligonucleotide. Plasmid, pASTM10-kan, was constructed by digesting pACYC177 with BfaI and pASTM10 with NdeI and ligating the two mixtures and selecting for kanamycin and tetracycline resistance on YT plates. The resulting plasmid, pASTM10-kan has the kanamycin cartridge cloned into the NdeI site located in the middle of TM-10. A 96-mer oligonucleotide encoding transmembrane helix 10 and the flanking regions was synthesized and gel purified (Keystone Laboratories) with 0.33% contamination at each of the bases between codon 315 and codon 335. A complementary primer was made to the 96-mer between positions 77 and 96. 200 pmol of each of the mutagenic and complementary primer were annealed by slow cooling (about 1 h) from 70°C to 40°C. The cassette was synthesized by extending the complementary primer with Klenow enzyme. After synthesis, the mixture was desalted using Qiagens Gel extraction kit followed by digestion with AatII and SpeI. The digest was desalted again prior to ligation. The vector was prepared by digesting approximately 2 µg of pASTM10-kan with AatII and SpeI and run on a 1% agarose gel. The resulting 6.5-kilobase pair band was cut and eluted from the agarose. Complete digestion by AatII and SpeI was verified by the presence of the DNA band lacking the kanamycin cartridge. The cassette synthesized above was ligated to this vector, transformed into MS1019, and plated on 1% lactose MacConkey plates. Plasmid DNA from a number of red, pink, and white colonies was isolated and the DNA sequenced. A variety of studies have shown an important role of transmembrane helix 10 within the lactose permease (23Brooker R.J. Wilson T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1024-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). According to our model, transmembrane helix 10 is a putative channel lining segment that interacts with several other transmembrane helices (22Goswitz V.C. Brooker R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the topology of transmembrane helix 10 within the lactose permease, the technique of cassette mutagenesis was used to generate random single site mutations within transmembrane helix. On 1% lactose MacConkey plates, the transformed colonies were predominantly red but some pink and white colonies were also apparent. Plasmid DNA from a total of 400 red, pink, and white colonies was isolated and sequenced in the transmembrane 10 region of the lacY gene. Although most were wild-type or had multiple mutations, 46 unique single amino acid substitutions were identified and saved for further analysis. The phenotypes of bacterial colonies on lactose MacConkey plates provides qualitative information about the level of activity of the lactose permease. Colonies containing active lactose permease have a red phenotype on 0.4% lactose MacConkey plates. Nearly complete elimination of lactose permease activity results in a white phenotype. At intermediate levels of activity, a pink or red center phenotype is seen. As shown in Table II, a number of the single mutants retained the red phenotype indicating the presence of a functional lactose permease. Other mutations had a significant effect on the function of the lactose permease. For example, G332D, M323K, etc., had a red center phenotype. One of the mutations, E325K, resulted in a lactose permease that was dramatically defective as indicated by a white phenotype. Overall, although most of the single mutations resulted in functional lactose permease as seen by the red phenotype, a few substitutions caused significant decreases in lactose permease activity.TABLE II.Helix 10 missense mutantsWild-type residueLocation in modelaThe residues in TM-10 are arranged according to our putative model that is described under “Discussion.”MutationPhenotype on 1% MacConkeybR, red phenotype which indicates very good lactose fermentation: R.C., red center which indicates low but significant fermentation; W, white which indicates poor fermentation.Transport activitycDownhill lactose transport was carried out as described under “Materials and Methods.” The results are expressed as the percentage of the initial rate of wild-type activity.Protein leveldThe amount of lactose permease proteins was determined by Western blotting analysis as described under “Materials and Methods.” The values are expressed as the percentage of mutant permease compared with the wild-type protein.Transport kineticseKm and Vmax values were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” The wild-type Km was 0.3 mM and the Vmax was 126.4 nmol of lactose/min·mg protein.

Open table in a new tab In vitro galactoside transport was performed to obtain more quantitative information about the level of activity of the mutant lactose permeases. In the results shown in Table II, mutant strains were analyzed for their ability to transport [14C]lactose “downhill” relative to the wild-type. In downhill transport assays, plasmids containing the wild-type lacY gene or mutant genes were introduced into an E. coli strain that is lacZ+ (i.e. β-galactosidase positive). Upon entry into the cell, lactose is rapidly metabolized so that the extracellular lactose concentration remains higher than the intracellular concentration (39Rickenberg H.V. Cohen G. Buttin G. Monod J. Ann. Inst. Pasteur. 1956; 91: 829-857PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, under these conditions, lactose transport is downhill or with its concentration gradient. As expected from the phenotypes on MacConkey plates, most of the mutants with the red phenotype showed high levels of lactose permease activity, whereas the mutants with red center phenotypes exhibited a significant decrease in lactose transport. Generally, the mutants with red center phenotypes had less than 15% of the activity compared to the wild-type. The E325K mutant's white phenotype on MacConkey plates is consistent with the extremely low level of lactose transport. In fact, this mutant had the lowest level of activity. Four of the mutants with red phenotypes on 0.4% MacConkey plates contain only 4, 9, and 14% of lactose transport relative to the wild-type. Although it is not surprising that occasionally a mutant with the red phenotype has only about 10-15%, it is rare that a mutant with a red phenotype, i.e. G332V, has only 4% activity. These results from in vitro galactoside transport were generally consistent with the phenotypes seen on the MacConkey plates. Mutants E325K, L329P, H322Y, L330P, M323K, F334S, P327L, T320P, and G332D had low activities as expected from the plating results. Furthermore, mutants V326G, M323L, G332V, and G332C also exhibited low activity even though they were red on MacConkey plates. All of the mutants which showed less that 30% downhill transport were analyzed with regard to the amount of lactose permease protein (see Table II). There was significant variation in protein levels among the mutant strains. In most mutants with less than 30% transport activity, the low rate of lactose transport did not quantitatively correlate with the amount of permease protein. For example, M323V had only 27% transport activity while its value for protein level was 75% that of the wild-type level. In these types of cases, the mutation in the permease appears to be directly affecting the function of the protein. In two mutants with very low transport activity, however, a lower level of protein did correlate with lower transport activity (e.g. M323K and G332V). In these two cases, the low rate of lactose transport can be explained by a defect in protein levels. Several of the mutants with low transport activity were also analyzed with regard to the kinetic parameters of lactose transport (i.e. Km and Vmax, see Table II). As expected, the mutations tended to raise the Km and/or lower the Vmax for lactose transport. Most mutants with low transport exhibited both a higher Km and a lower Vmax. As discussed later under “Discussion,” the mutants in Table II are arranged according to our model of the topology of TM-10 (see Fig. 3 under “Discussion”). Mutations in the putative channel lining side of TM-10 tended to have higher Km values compared to mutations in other regions. In two cases (L329P and C333Y), mutations along the channel lining face had little or no effect on the velocity of lactose transport. To further explore the importance of transmembrane helix 10 topology, hydrophobic insertional mutants were systematically made along helix 10. As shown in Fig. 1, a hydrophobic amino acid of either valine or leucine was inserted every 2 or 3 amino acids along the entire transmembrane helix 10. In order to qualitatively assess the level of lactose permease activity, each of the insertional mutants was streaked on 1 and 0.2% lactose MacConkey plates. Insertional mutants Leu-315′ and Val-318′ had a red phenotype on both 1 and 0.2% lactose MacConkey plates, whereas Leu-320′ and Val-323′ were still red on 1% but white on 0.2% MacConkey plates (Table III). In contrast, Leu-326′, Val-329′, Leu-332′, and Leu-335′ were white on both 1 and 0.2% lactose MacConkey plates. Results from in vitro galactoside transport further confirm that insertional mutants Leu-315′ and Val-318′ transport lactose uphill and downhill relatively well (see Fig. 2). However, the other insertional mutants showed dramatically diminished abilities to transport lactose. Phenotypes on 1 and 0.2% lactose MacConkey and [14C]lactose transport assays are consistent with the notion that the insertions near the periplasmic edge are less deleterious than the insertions in the middle or the cytoplasmic edge.TABLE III.Phenotype of insertional mutantsPlasmid1% LactoseaThe phenotype was determined on 1% and 0.2% lactose MacConkey plates.

The uptake of [14C]lactose was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Downhill lactose uptake was carried out in strain HS4006/F′IQZ+Y- containing the lacY plasmids described within the figure. Uphill accumulation was carried out in strain, T184, that is β-galactosidase negative. The percentage of downhill and uphill lactose transport activity of each of the insertional mutants is compared to the wild-type at the 1-min time point.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to examine the topology of transmembrane helix 10 in greater detail, a number of substitution and insertional mutants were constructed and analyzed in this study. The results have identified amino acids in transmembrane helix 10 that are tolerant of substitution by various other amino acids and those that are less tolerant. In particular, amino acids at positions 320, 331, 324, and 317 were shown to allow many substitutions. Interestingly, in a helical wheel projection of transmembrane helix 10, most of the amino acids that permit substitutions by a variety of amino acids are clustered together in one region (see bilayer face of helix 10 in Fig. 3). Mutants that significantly reduce the lactose permease activity are scattered throughout the remaining regions of the helical wheel projection. Based on our three-dimensional model (Fig. 3), transmembrane helix 10 should contain a channel lining face, a lipid bilayer interacting face, and two or three putative helical interacting regions. Analyses of the data from amino acid substitutions suggests that the helical face containing Thr-320, Val-331, Phe-324, and Ile-317 might be a membrane interacting face. All of the substitutions obtained in this region have activity similar to the wild-type with the exception of the T320P mutation. It is likely that the low activity seen in the T320P strain is due to the perturbation of the α-helical structure of transmembrane helix 10. It is striking that all four of the amino acids (Thr-320, Val-331, Phe-324, and Ile-317) predicted to be involved in the interaction with the lipid bilayer allow amino acid substitutions with larger side chain volume (T320M, V331L, V331M, F324W, and I317F) and smaller side chain volume. Such substitutions would most likely be permitted if the amino acids were involved in interacting with the lipid bilayer. In contrast, substitutions with larger side chain volumes would most likely be deleterious to normal function of the protein if the amino acids were involved in helical interactions or projecting into the channel lumen. Our results suggest that the helical face containing Glu-325, Leu-318, Leu-329, His-322, Val-315, Cys-333, Val-326, and Lys-319 is likely to be the channel lining domain for a number of reasons. First, this face of the helix contains three amino acids with ionizable side chains. Second, many previous studies have indicated that amino acids on this face may be involved with sugar and/or H+ recognition (23Brooker R.J. Wilson T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3959-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24Collins J.C. Permuth S.F. Brooker R.J. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1024-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with the current study since detrimental mutations along this face tended to have a substantially higher Km for lactose transport. Even so, it is not surprising that mutations along this putative channel lining face had variable effects. The substitution of bulky amino acids at some positions may inhibit lactose transport by sterically blocking the channel or by affecting residues that are directly involved in substrate recognition and transport. However, substitution by bulky amino acids at other positions may not inhibit lactose transport because there may be sufficient space in the lumen of the channel to accommodate the increase in side chain volume without affecting the normal substrate recognition and transport. With regard to the putative channel lining face in Fig. 3, it is interesting to comment on the location of Glu-325 that has been implicated to function as a H+ binding site. Our data suggests that Glu-325 is not projecting into the center of the putative channel pathway but rather is displaced toward the edge that interacts with transmembrane helices 8 and 9. This result is consistent with spectroscopic studies that have shown that His-322 (on TM-10) is in close proximity with Glu-269 (on TM-8) and Arg-302 (on TM-9) is close to His-322 and Glu-325 (Refs. 41Jung K. Voss J. He M. Hubbell W.L. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6272-6277Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar and 42He M.M. Voss J. Hubbell W.L. Kaback H.R.

According to our model, there are several residues in helix 10 (Leu-330, Met-323, Phe-328, Leu-321, and Gly-332) that are potentially interacting with other transmembrane segments. In cases where the wild-type residue is already bulky (Phe-328, Leu-321, and Leu-330), amino acid substitutions were tolerated in these regions. An exception is the L330P mutation which is expected to alter helix topology. By comparison, the Met-323 and Gly-332 positions were relatively intolerant of amino acid substitutions. For example, all four of the mutations at position 332 significantly reduced the downhill lactose transport activity. Since glycine is the smallest amino acid, it would seem reasonable to suggest that substitution with another amino acid which has a larger volume may be deleterious if the glycine is involved in interhelical interactions. It is also noteworthy that the Western results described in Table II indicated that substitutions in these interhelical regions are more likely to lower the protein level of the lactose permease compared with substitutions in the putative channel lining or bilayer face of helix 10 (see Table II). Insertion of amino acids at the periplasmic edge of transmembrane helix 10 were less deleterious than insertions in the center or near the cytoplasmic edge of the helix. Analysis of the insertional mutants indicates the importance of the spatial relationship between the amino acids. For example, pLeu-326′, which is adjacent to a functionally critical amino acid, glutamate 325, has a white phenotype on 1% lactose MacConkey plates and is totally inactive, whereas Leu-315′ has a red phenotype on 1% lactose MacConkey plates and is fairly active. In general, it appears that the topology of the central and cytoplasmic edge of transmembrane helix 10 is critical for activity. In contrast, this does not seem to be a factor with insertions near the periplasmic edge. These results suggest that the precise location of the amino acids at the periplasmic edge is not critical for the activity of the lactose permease."
