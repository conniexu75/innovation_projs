https://openalex.org/W2083848684,"Events in the synthesis and processing of prepro-alpha-factor have been assessed with the aid of mutants blocked at various stages in the yeast secretory pathway. In normal cells treated with tunicamycin, a precursor accumulates which is identical in molecular weight to the primary translation product synthesized in vitro. At the restrictive temperature in a mutant blocked early in the pathway (sec53), a molecule of similar molecular weight accumulates. In mutants affecting translocation into (sec59) and passage from (sec 18) the endoplasmic reticulum, a glycosylated form of the precursor containing three N-linked core oligosaccharides accumulates; however, it appears that the signal peptide is not removed. The glycosylated precursor first experiences proteolytic processing when accumulated in a mutant (sec7) blocked at the stage of the Golgi apparatus. Substantially greater amounts of the mature pheromone are seen in mutants that accumulate secretory vesicles (sec1, sec2, sec3, sec5)."

https://openalex.org/W2031684542,"The intracellular distribution of the major Drosophila heat-shock protein hsp70 was determined by indirect immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies. During heat shock the protein concentrates strongly in nuclei while a small quantity remains cytoplasmic. During recovery hsp70 leaves the nuclei and becomes distributed throughout the cytoplasm. With a second heat shock it is rapidly transported back into the nucleus. Nuclear translocation depends not on the temperature per se, but on the physiological state of the cell since it also occurs after exposure to an anoxic atmosphere at normal temperatures. We also provide evidence that hsps protect cells from the toxic effects of anoxia, as well as heat, and conclude that nuclear translocation of hsp70 is related to its function in protecting the organism from both forms of environmental stress."
https://openalex.org/W1608334798,"Three hepatic microsomal cytochromes P-450 (P-450f, P-450g, and P-450h) have been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from both untreated and ethanol-treated adult male rats. By all criteria examined, the hemoproteins isolated from untreated rats are indistinguishable from the corresponding enzymes purified from rats administered ethanol. Highly purified cytochromes P-450f, P-450g and P-450h are characterized by minimum Mr of 51,000, 50,000, and 51,000, respectively, and unique coordinates in two-dimensional isoelectric focusing-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The CO-reduced spectral maxima of cytochromes P-450f and P-450g are at 447-448 nm, and the peak of cytochrome P-450h is at 451 nm. Cytochrome P-450h is a versatile catalyst exhibiting high activity toward benzphetamine, hexobarbital, and estradiol-17 beta and moderate activity toward benzo[alpha]pyrene and zoxazolamine. In contrast, cytochromes P-450f and P-450g have low metabolic activity for these substrates. The three hemoproteins catalyze the metabolism of testosterone with different regio- and stereospecificities and overall rates. Both cytochromes P-450f and P-450h catalyze the hydroxylation of testosterone at the 16 alpha-position; however, cytochrome P-450h also oxidizes the steroid at the 2 alpha- and 17 beta-position (androstenedione formation). Testosterone is oxidatively metabolized at the 6 beta-, 15 alpha- and an unknown position by cytochrome P-450g. Peptide maps, generated by proteolytic or chemical digestion of the hemoproteins, indicate that cytochromes P-450f, P-450g, and P-450h differ structurally from each other and five previously characterized rat hepatic microsomal cytochromes P-450 (P-450a, P-450b, P-450c, P-450d, and P-450e). Cytochromes P-450f, P-450g, and P-450h do not react with antibodies directed against these inducible hemoproteins by Ouchterlony immunodiffusion in the presence of detergent; however, in the absence of detergent, cytochrome P-450f cross-reacts weakly with anti-P-450b. Results of this study indicate that rat hepatic microsomal cytochromes P-450 are composed of at least four hemoproteins with CO-reduced absorbance maxima between 447-448 nm. Furthermore, a minimum of four microsomal cytochromes P-450 are now known to 16 alpha-hydroxylate testosterone."
https://openalex.org/W2109291340,A tissue-specific transcriptional enhancer element that is associated with the human immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus is defined. In a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that contains a translocated c-myc gene this enhancer is retained on the 14q+ chromosome and occurs within sequences shown to activate previously cryptic promoters of the c-myc gene.
https://openalex.org/W2020539068,"3-Aminobenzamide and benzamide, purported to be specific inhibitors of the synthesis of poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose), were used to elucidate possible functions of this biopolymer. These compounds, at frequently used experimental concentrations, not only inhibited the action of poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) synthetase but also affected cell viability, glucose metabolism, and DNA synthesis. Thus, the usefulness of 3-aminobenzamide and benzamide may be severely restricted by the difficulty of finding a dose small enough to inhibit the synthetase without producing additional metabolic effects."

https://openalex.org/W2001048171,"Nucleotide sequences of the human alpha 1 and two allelic alpha 2 immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region genes are presented. The genes contain three exons, each encoding a single constant region protein domain. The protein hinge region is encoded at the 5' end of the second exon, and the rapid evolutionary changes in length of the hinge correspond to duplications or deletions within the hinge-coding region, probably facilitated by repeats in the DNA sequence. Alignment of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 gene sequences reveals an unusual coupled deletion-duplication in the 5'-flanking region, which can be explained in terms of a slipped-strand mispairing model. Comparison of nucleotide sequences of the alpha 1 gene and two alleles of the alpha 2 gene indicates a localized transfer of genetic information from the 3' end of the alpha 1 gene to one of the alpha 2 alleles, probably by a gene conversion. At one end of the region within which conversion apparently occurred, there is a 40 bp sequence of the type that can form Z-DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1574964842,"A reconstituted monooxygenase system containing a form of cytochrome P-450, termed P-450(14)DM, and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, both purified from yeast microsomes, catalyzed the conversion of lanosterol (4,4,14 alpha-trimethyl-5 alpha-cholesta-8,24-dien-3 beta-01) to a sterol metabolite in the presence of NADPH and molecular oxygen. This conversion did not occur anaerobically or when either P-450(14)DM, the reductase, or NADPH was omitted from the system. In both free and trimethylsilylated forms, this metabolite showed a relative retention time (relative to lanosterol) of 1.10 in gas chromatography on OV-17 columns. Comparison of its mass spectrum and retention time with those of lanosterol and 4,4-dimethylzymosterol (4,4-dimethyl-5 alpha-cholesta-8,24-dien-3 beta-ol) indicated that the metabolite was 4,4-dimethyl-5 alpha-cholesta-8,14,24-trien-3 beta-ol. Upon aerobic incubation of microsomes from semianaerobically grown yeast cells in the presence of NADPH and cyanide, endogenous lanosterol was converted to 4,4-dimethylzymosterol. This metabolism was inhibited by CO, metyrapone, SKF-525A, and antibodies to P-450(14)DM. It is concluded that in yeast microsomes lanosterol is 14 alpha-demethylated by a P-450(14)DM-containing monooxygenase system to give rise to 4,4-dimethyl-5 alpha-cholesta-8,14,24-trien-3 beta-ol, which is then reduced to 4,4-dimethylzymosterol by an NADPH-linked reductase."

https://openalex.org/W1981210273,"The globin and immunoglobulin multigene families have been used to study the effect of chromosomal organization on the time of gene replication. Some of the genes are late-replicating, providing the first identification of late-replicating sequences that are not highly repetitive. One is a member of the mouse alpha-globin gene family, which consists of genes mapping to three different chromosomes. The other genes in this family replicate early during S. Our studies demonstrate that immunoglobulin gene rearrangements and rearrangements between these genes and the c-myc oncogene are accompanied by dramatic differences in their temporal order of replication. We conclude that a gene's position in the chromosome, rather than its sequence, determines the time of replication. We suggest that the differences in association with gene rearrangement result from changes in the proximity of the affected gene to sites that control the temporal order of replication during S."

Rat islets of Langerhans similarly irradiated remained hormonally functional when transplanted into syngeneic diabetic rats. Allogeneic transplantation across a major histocompatibility barrier of islets initially treated in vitro with ultraviolet irradiation resulted in prolonged allograft survival without the use of any immunosuppressive agents.

https://openalex.org/W2003925086,"The presence of histones in hsp 70 genes was studied by ""protein-image"" hybridization technique after crosslinking histones to DNA. With increasing transcription of the genes, the coding region was demonstrated to be depleted first of H1 and then of all histones. This probably accounts for unraveling the 25 nm silent chromatin fiber to moderately and actively transcribed 10 nm fiber and linearized DNA. No histones were found in the 5'-terminal DNAase I-hypersensitive region, which may be a prerequisite to gene activation. The absence of histones on DNA correlates well with the high nuclease sensitivity and disappearance of the regular pattern in micrococcal nuclease digests of chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1495245233,"Proteoglycans isolated from the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma were shown to contain 35 mol of phosphate/mol of proteoglycan. While 20% of this phosphate was released by digestion with dilute alkali in the presence of sodium borohydride and is presumably of the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine type, 78% of the phosphate copurified with the peptide-free chondroitin sulfate chains. When chondroitin sulfate chains purified by ethanol precipitation or Sephacryl S200 column chromatography were digested with chondroitinase AC and the digests chromatographed on Bio-Gel P-4, the phosphate co-migrated with a carbohydrate fragment that contained 2 glucuronic acid (one as delta 4,5-unsaturated sugar), 1-galactosamine, 2-galactose, and 1-phosphate residue/xylitol. A second fragment of similar composition but lacking phosphate was also recovered in a ratio of about 3 to 1 relative to the phosphorylated fragment. The phosphate in the chondroitin sulfate linkage region fragment had the alkaline phosphatase sensitivity as well as 31P NMR spectra of a monophosphate esterified to a secondary sugar alcohol. The phosphate was localized on the C-2 of the chain initiating xylose since these residues as xylitol showed a delayed release during acid hydrolysis and the xylitol was recovered intact after periodate oxidation. In the chondrosarcoma, 2-phosphoxylose appears to be a normal synthetic product since [32P]phosphate was readily incorporated into the proteoglycan and the incorporated isotope had similar biochemical properties as the unlabeled phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1618550443,"Dissociated chromaffin cells from bovine adrenal medulla were stimulated to secrete epinephrine and dopamine beta-hydroxylase with a variety of secretagogues in a study designed to test the hypothesis that the chemiosmotic lysis reaction of isolated chromaffin granules might in some way be related to the mechanism of release during exocytosis. Increasing the osmotic strength of the incubation medium with either NaCl or sucrose led to suppression of secretion of epinephrine from the cells regardless of whether secretion was induced with veratridine or acetylcholine. Suppression of secretion was approximately exponential with respect to osmotic strength. Epinephrine secretion occurred only if the medium contained a permeant anion such as chloride, and secretion induced by veratridine was suppressed when Na isethionate replaced NaCl in the medium. In an extensive study with different monovalent anions veratridine supported epinephrine secretion according to the following activity series: Br-, I-, NO3- greater than methylsulfate, SCN- greater than Cl greater than acetate much greater than isethionate. A similar series, except for the potency of NO3-, was observed with A23187 as agonist. In general, the anion series for granule lysis was analogous. However, there was a poor quantitative correlation between the anion dependence of chemiosmotic granule lysis and the anion dependence of cell secretion. Anion transport inhibitors such as probenecid and pyridoxal phosphate also inhibited secretion while the stilbene disulfonates were inactive. The ineffectiveness of the stilbene disulfonates further distinguished chemiosmotic granule lysis from cell secretion. Secretion of catecholamines, induced by veratridine or nicotine, a cholinergic agonist, was suppressed when NaCl in the medium was replaced by isosmotic sucrose and unexpectedly low levels of dopamine beta-hydroxylase were observed in some cases. In sum, these properties of secreting chromaffin cells resembled some properties of isolated chromaffin granules incubated in ATP and Cl-, but were different in a number of instances. We, therefore, have interpreted our data to indicate that while some mechanistic relationships may indeed exist between the release event in exocytosis from chromaffin cells and the chemiosmotic lysis reaction characteristic of isolated chromaffin granules, an understanding of the energetics of exocytosis awaits the discovery of reasons for the quantitative differences between the two systems."
https://openalex.org/W1552839202,"Calmodulin binding to microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) was studied by using three experimental techniques: affinity chromatography, cross-linking, and equilibrium binding. 1) Calmodulin affinity chromatography: both MAP2 and proteins were bound to calmodulin affinity columns in the presence of calcium and released with ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), whereas tubulin was not bound. 2) Cross-linking 125I-calmodulin to whole MAPs and MAP2 by disuccinimidyl suberate: 125I-calmodulin was cross-linked to MAP2 and proteins showing an intense radioactivity band at 300,000 daltons and a diffuse band between 70,000 and 90,000 daltons. The cross-linking was calcium-dependent and was blocked by EGTA, trifluoperazine, or excess unlabeled calmodulin. 3) Equilibrium binding of 125I-calmodulin to MAP2 and using the Hummel-Dreyer technique on Sephadex G-100 columns: MAP2 and proteins bound 125I-calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner and no binding occurred in the presence of EGTA. The apparent dissociation constant of calmodulin for MAP2 was 7 microM. The results indicate that calmodulin exerts its effect on microtubule assembly through the formation of a Ca2+ X calmodulin X MAP2 or X tau complex."
https://openalex.org/W1623765232,"The substrate specificity of heparosan N-sulfate D-glucuronosyl 5-epimerase from a mouse mastocytoma was examined to determine the effects of N-acetyl and O-sulfate groups on substrate recognition by the enzyme. [5-3H]Glucuronosyl-labeled heparosan N-sulfate was prepared enzymatically and was modified chemically by partial N-desulfation and N-acetylation. After enzymatic release of tritium, the location of remaining label was determined by deaminative cleavage and analysis of resulting di-, tetra-, and higher oligosaccharides. This analysis indicated that a D-glucuronosyl residue is recognized as a substrate if it is linked at C-1 to an N-acetylated glucosamine residue and at C-4 to an N-sulfated unit. However, the reverse structure, in which the D-glucuronosyl moiety is bound at C-1 to an N-sulfated residue and at C-4 to N-acetylated glucosamine, is not a substrate. Similar studies with O-sulfated heparin intermediates showed that O-sulfate groups either at C-2 of the L-iduronosyl moieties or at C-6 of vicinal D-glucosaminyl moieties prevent 5-epimerization. These findings were confirmed by studies of the reverse reaction, in which tritium was incorporated from 3H2O into partially O-desulfated heparin and the location of incorporated radioactivity was determined. These and more direct experiments corroborated the previous conclusion that the L-iduronosyl moieties are formed after N-sulfation but before O-sulfation. Assessment of the influence of substrate size on the reaction further showed that a large substrate is preferred; an octasaccharide released tritium at a rate approximately 10% of that observed for the parent polysaccharide, and some release occurred also with smaller oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W2078060982,"The resistance of the infectious agent of scrapie disease to sterilization at 100 degrees or 121 degrees C is reputed to be inconsistent with the structure of conventional viruses. However, in kinetic studies the majority of hamster scrapie strain 263K infectivity was (like that of previously characterized viruses) rapidly inactivated at temperatures of 100 degrees C or greater. Small resistant subpopulations remained. Similar heat-resistant subpopulations were observed at 60 degrees C for phage lambda but only in the presence of brain homogenate. Brain homogenate may also confer stability to small subfractions of scrapie infectivity. Such refractory subpopulations cannot be used to make structural inferences that are properly obtained from the behavior of the majority population as revealed in the initial inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1600945317,"Platelet membranes contain two distinct transacylase activities catalyzing the synthesis of arachidonoyl phosphatides by acylation of added lysophosphatides with endogenous esterified arachidonate. In the absence of CoA, arachidonate is incorporated only into ethanolamine lysophosphatides with a high preference for the plasmalogen form (Kramer, R. M., and Deykin, D. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 13806-13811). In the presence of CoA, however, lysophospholipids are acylated in the order 1-acyl-lysophosphatidylserine greater than 1-acyl-lysophosphatidylethanolamine greater than 1-acyl-lysophosphatidylinositol. The CoA-mediated transacylation reaction was characterized with 1-acyl-lysophosphatidylserine as acyl acceptor. It was highly specific for arachidonate and preferentially used phosphatidylcholine as the arachidonoyl donor. This enzymatic pathway may be part of a deacylation-transacylation cycle for remodeling of phospholipids synthesized de novo (according to the Lands pathway) representing a mechanism for enrichment of phospholipids with arachidonic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1576939859,"Two different isoenzymes of fructose-P2 aldolase can be resolved by chromatography of crude spinach leaf extracts on DEAE-cellulose columns. The acidic isoenzyme comprises about 85% of the total leaf aldolase activity. The two forms differ in primary structure as judged by their distinctive amino acid compositions, tryptic peptide patterns, and immunological properties. Only the acidic isoenzyme was detected in extracts of isolated chloroplasts, suggesting that this molecule represents the chloroplast form of spinach leaf aldolase while the basic isoenzyme is of cytosolic origin. The cytosolic (basic) isoenzyme and chicken aldolase A4 are similar in the following respects. 1) They have similar specific catalytic activity (10-15 units/mg); 2) they are both highly sensitive to inactivation by very limited digestion with bovine pancreatic carboxypeptidase A; 3) they both have subunit molecular weights of 40,000; 4) they both have derivatized (blocked) NH2-terminal structures; 5) they are both resistant to thermal denaturation at 50 degrees C; and 6) they both regain catalytic activity following reversible denaturation at pH 2.3 or in 5.8 M urea. Also, the cytosolic aldolase cross-reacted immunologically with the single aldolases present in spinach seeds and in wheat germ. Further, this isoenzyme readily hybridized with chicken aldolase A4 in vitro. These observations demonstrate the close homology between the cytosolic aldolases derived from plant and animal origins. The chloroplast aldolase had a specific catalytic activity of about 8 units/mg and, like its cytosolic counterpart, was severely inactivated by limited digestion with carboxypeptidase A. However, this isoenzyme was distinct from the cytosolic aldolase in the following characteristics: 1) its small subunit size (Mr congruent to 38,000); 2) its underivatized NH2-terminal structure; 3) its high sensitivity to thermal denaturation at 50 degrees C; and 4) its inability to refold into an enzymatically active conformation following denaturation at pH 2.3 or in 5.8 M urea. The distinctive properties of the chloroplast aldolase may be expected for an enzyme which is synthesized as a higher molecular weight precursor on cytosolic polysomes and is then proteolytically processed to the mature form during its migration into the chloroplast organelle."

https://openalex.org/W1591476755,"Testosterone 15 alpha-hydroxylase (cytochrome P-450(15) alpha) was purified from female 129/J mouse liver microsomes based on its specific activities in the eluates from the columns of octylamino-Sepharose 4B, hydroxylapatite, DEAE-Bio-Gel A, and CM52 chromatography. The 15 alpha-hydroxylation activity was five times higher in female than in male 129/J mouse liver microsomes. The specific cytochrome P-450 content of purified P-450(15) alpha fraction was 14.5 nmol/mg of protein. The Soret peak of the reduced cytochrome P-450-CO complex was 451 nm. The apparent subunit molecular weight of P-450(15) alpha was 48,000, and the protein appeared as only one major band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The specific activity of testosterone 15 alpha-hydroxylation reconstituted with the purified P-450(15) alpha was 94 nmol/min/nmol of cytochrome P-450 and 1349 nmol/min/mg of protein, and these were about 65- and 1000-fold higher, respectively, than the activity of solubilized microsomes. The purified P-450(15) alpha exhibited high regioselectivity and stereospecificity for testosterone hydroxylation. More than 95% of the testosterone metabolites formed by the purified P-450(15) alpha was 15 alpha-hydroxytestosterone. Virtually 100% of mouse liver microsomal testosterone 15 alpha-hydroxylation activity can be accounted for by the purified P-450(15) alpha. The P-450(15) alpha fraction was able to catalyze benzphetamine N-demethylation, 7-ethoxycoumarin O-de-ethylation, aniline 4-hydroxylation, benzo(alpha)pyrene 3-hydroxylation, acetanilide 4-hydroxylation, and lauric acid (11 + 12)-hydroxylation at various turnover rates, indicating broad substrate specificity of the P-450(15) alpha for the oxidations of xenobiotics. This is in sharp contrast to high regioselectivity and stereospecificity for testosterone hydroxylation."
https://openalex.org/W2019367908,"During development of Drosophila the bithorax complex of genes is responsible for diversification of segments in the ectoderm. The muscles derive from the mesoderm and their pattern also varies from segment to segment—a variation that could be determined directly through deployment of the bithorax complex in the muscle cells themselves. Alternatively, the muscle pattern could be determined indirectly, either by the epidermal cells to which the muscles attach, or by the nerves which contact developing muscles. Using a segment-specific muscle found only in males and a new mutation in the bithorax complex, we show that the development of this muscle is independent of the sex and segmental identity of the epidermis. The development of the muscle therefore depends on the sex and state of the bithorax complex in the muscle nuclei themselves or in part of the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1537090944,"Variant forms of apolipoprotein A-I (apo-A-I) have been shown to exist in the human population. One mutant form, referred to as apo-A-I-Munster-3, is one charge unit more basic than normal apo-A-I on isoelectric focusing gels. This variant has the same immunologic characteristics and molecular weight as normal apo-A-I. The apo-A-I-Munster-3 from subjects in three unrelated families (in two of which the trait has been shown to be transmitted as an autosomal co-dominant) has been analyzed by partial amino acid sequencing to define the cause of the electrophoretic abnormality. In the apo-A-I of family A, the abnormality was shown to occur in the smallest cyanogen bromide fragment, CB-2 (residues 87-112), and amino acid sequencing revealed asparagine instead of the usual aspartic acid at residue 103. Subjects with this mutant form have shown no signs of dyslipoproteinemia. The NH2-terminal cyanogen bromide fragment (CB-1, residues 1-86) from the apo-A-I of family B was shown to differ electrophoretically from normal CB-1, and amino acid sequencing revealed that a substitution of arginine for proline at residue 4 was responsible for this variant form. Analysis of the plasma lipids of one affected family B member demonstrated that the percentage of the total cholesterol that was esterified was somewhat lower than that normally observed. In a third family, family C, a variant having the same electrophoretic abnormality as the other two was determined to have an amino acid substitution at yet a different position. In this variant, histidine was found at residue 3 in the apo-A-I sequence, rather than the usual proline. In all three cases, the substitution could account for the electrophoretic abnormality. It is proposed that these three apo-A-I-Munster-3 variants be designated apo-A-I(Asp103----Asn), apo-A-I(Pro4----Arg), and apo-A-I(Pro3----His), respectively, to indicate the substitution that accounts for the abnormality in isoelectric focusing gels."
https://openalex.org/W1589137921,"Rat hemidiaphragms were denervated in vivo and then incubated in vitro to assess the ability of insulin to stimulate glycogen synthesis. Denervation for 1 day resulted in 50% decreases in the stimulation by insulin of [U-14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen, and in both the basal and the insulin-stimulated activity ratios (activity minus glucose-6-P/activity plus glucose-6-P) of glycogen synthase; however, the stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake by insulin was not affected by 1 day of denervation. The hormonal stimulation of [U-14C]glucose into glycogen was decreased by 90% after 3 days of denervation. At this time, the stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake by insulin was also reduced and the synthase activity ratios remained depressed. Consistent with its reduced effect on glucose transport, the hormone did not increase glucose-6-P in the 3-day denervated muscles. Furthermore, the Ka for activation of glycogen synthase by glucose-6-P was higher in denervated muscles, and denervation abolished the effect of insulin on decreasing the Ka. The results presented demonstrate that denervation rapidly reduces the extent to which glycogen synthase can be activated by insulin, and has a later effect on decreasing the stimulation of glucose transport. These two effects act synergistically to markedly decrease the hormonal stimulation of glycogen synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1579530296,"The mechanism by which palmitic and oleic acids modify calcium sequestration by sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles was investigated by examining the effects of these fatty acids on calcium-dependent ATPase activity, on the phosphoenzyme intermediates found during calcium sequestration reactions, and on passive membrane permeability to calcium. The calcium sequestered in the presence of these fatty acids was also characterized by determining the amount exchangeable with the extravesicular pool or released by the ionophore A23187. In the presence of 50 microM ATP, 18 microM palmitic acid enhanced and 18 microM oleic acid inhibited calcium sequestration, whereas both fatty acids stimulated ATPase activity. Neither fatty acid had significant effects on the amount or distribution of the phosphoenzyme formed during the calcium transport reaction. Palmitic acid stimulated calcium sequestration only when ATP was present. Oleic acid caused the release of a portion of the accumulated calcium during ATP-supported calcium sequestration and also enhanced the release observed in ATP-depleted reactions. A portion of the calcium sequestered in the presence of palmitic acid appears to be incorporated into a nonexchangeable and ionophore-insensitive calcium pool, although the latter was estimated to be considerably larger than the nonexchangeable pool. These data support the hypothesis that oleic acid inhibits calcium sequestration by increasing membrane permeability to calcium, whereas palmitic acid appears to stimulate calcium sequestration by interacting with a portion of the calcium within the vesicles to form a separate, poorly exchangeable calcium pool."
https://openalex.org/W1504804986,"The zwitterionic detergent 3-(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) supports reconstituted cyclohexane hydroxylase activity of cytochrome P-450LM2 and NADPH-cytochrome reductase purified from phenobarbital-induced rabbit liver. Maximum activity (approximately 50% of that with phospholipid) was observed at 2 mM CHAPS. Inhibition took place at higher CHAPS, until at 20 mM CHAPS, no cyclohexane hydroxylase activity was observed. There was little denaturation of the two enzymes under these conditions. At 2 mM CHAPS, P-450LM2 was pentameric (Mr = 250,000) and reductase was dimeric (Mr = 139,500) by sedimentation equilibrium. P-450 was monomeric in 20 mM CHAPS. In addition, a stable complex between the two enzymes was not detected under conditions of maximum activity, even in the presence of saturating substrate. This confirms our previous conclusion that a stable complex between cytochrome P-450LM2 and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase is not a prerequisite for reconstituted xenobiotic hydroxylation (Dean, W. L., and Gray, R. D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 14679-14685). Difference spectra of ferric P-450LM2 revealed that below 5 mM CHAPS, the high spin form of the cytochrome was slightly stabilized, while higher CHAPS levels stabilized the low spin form. Monomeric P-450LM2 formed with 20 mM CHAPS catalyzed the hydroxylation of toluene by cumene hydroperoxide. Thus, the reason that monomeric cytochrome P-450LM2 was inactive in NADPH-supported hydroxylation may either be because the bound detergent blocked productive interaction of the cytochrome with reductase or the monomer may be intrinsically incapable of interaction with reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1544925888,"Intact human erythrocytes incubated with L-[methyl-3H]methionine incorporated radioactivity into base-labile linkages with membrane and cytosolic proteins which are characteristic of protein methyl esters. Kinetic analysis of the methylation reactions in intact cells shows that individual erythrocytes contain approximately 38,000 and 115,000 protein methyl esters with biological half-lives of 150 min or less in the membrane and cytosolic protein fractions, respectively. Fractionation of the methylated cytosolic species by gel filtration chromatography at pH 6.5 followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis at pH 2.4 reveals that many different cytosolic proteins serve as methyl acceptors and that the degree of modification varies widely for individual proteins. For example, hemoglobin is modified to the extent of 3 methyl groups/10(6) polypeptide chains, while carbonic anhydrase contains 1 methyl group/approximately 16,500 polypeptide chains at steady state. Aspartic acid beta-[3H]methyl ester (Asp beta-[3H]Me) can be isolated from carboxypeptidase Y digests of cytosol proteins. By synthesizing and separating diastereomeric L-Leu-L-Asp beta Me and L-Leu-D-Asp beta Me dipeptides, we show that all of the Asp beta-[3H]Me recovered from cytosolic proteins is in the D-stereoconfiguration. Based on these data and on previous observations that erythrocytes contain a single methyltransferase which also methylates red cell membrane proteins at D-aspartyl residues both in vivo (McFadden, P. N., and Clarke, S. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 2460-2464) and in vitro (O'Connor, C. M., and Clarke, S. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8485-8492), we propose that protein carboxyl methylation is part of a generalized mechanism for metabolizing damaged proteins. The infrequent and spontaneous occurrence of D-aspartyl residues in proteins adequately explains the broad substrate specificity and limited stoichiometries of protein carboxyl methylation reactions."

Survivors of the selection were screened by replica plating and autoradiographic assay of [3H]arachidonate esterification; a mutant cell line, EPU-1, was established. EPU-1 cells contain one-third as much arachidonate as normal HSDM1C1 cells. The mutant lacks arachidonate-specific acyl-CoA synthetase, which accounts for decreased arachidonate uptake. EPU-1 exhibits enhanced turnover of arachidonoyl- but not linoleoyl-phosphatidylcholine. Bradykinin-induced arachidonate release and prostaglandin E2 synthesis are decreased in EPU-1. Thus, arachidonoyl-CoA synthetase is required for arachidonate homeostasis in HSDM1C1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1567114658,"A free sulfhydryl group previously has been shown to be required for carbohydrate binding to the lectin from lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) (Gould, N. R. and Scheinberg, S. L. (1970) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 141, 607-613). Modification of this group by sulfhydryl reagents was specifically inhibited by D-GalNAc. We have further examined the reactivity of sulfhydryl groups in lima bean lectin with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Nbs2) as a probe for carbohydrate and metal ion binding. The 4 thiol groups in tetrameric lima bean lectin component III gave identical kinetics for reaction with Nbs2 involving formation of a weak noncovalent complex between Nbs2 and the lectin. The pH-independent reactivity of the thiol groups at neutral pH suggested that the thiols may exist as ion pairs with a nearby ionized group. Carbohydrate ligands were competitive inhibitors of thiol modification. The thiol groups on all 4 subunits of lima bean lectin were completely and reversibly protected by carbohydrate binding. The ability of carbohydrates to inhibit thiol modification correlated with their potency as inhibitors in a precipitin inhibition assay. The best inhibitors were the oligosaccharides alpha-D-GalNAc-(1 leads to 3)[alpha-L-fucose-(1 leads to 2)]beta-D-Gal(1 leads to R) and alpha-D-GalNAc-(1 leads to 2)beta-D-Gal(1 leads to R). Apparent thermodynamic parameters for binding of several carbohydrates were determined by measuring the temperature dependence of thiol protection. Removal of the bound metal ions Ca2+ and Mn2+ following dialysis into EDTA inactivated the lectin and increased the reactivity of the thiol groups 60-fold. This conversion was temperature-dependent and could be reversed upon addition of metal ions. The fast-reacting thiol groups were not protected by haptenic sugars from modifications by Nbs2."
https://openalex.org/W1571261261,"Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate was used to selectively modify lysine residues on antithrombin III. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate was incubated with antithrombin, and the Schiff base was reduced with sodium borohydride. A maximum of 3-4 pyridoxal 5'-phosphate groups per antithrombin molecule are bound at high concentrations of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. A linear decrease in heparin cofactor activity was observed with the incorporation of the first three pyridoxyl phosphate groups. Modification in the presence of added heparin decreased the extent of labeling by 1-2 mol of pyridoxyl phosphate per mol of antithrombin and protected against the loss of heparin cofactor activity. To further examine the role of lysine residues in the interaction of antithrombin III with heparin, the protein was singly labeled with pyridoxyl phosphate and affinity fractionated on heparin-agarose. Three species, each containing approximately one pyridoxyl phosphate group per antithrombin, were obtained. Two of these derivatives had reduced affinity for heparin-agarose, exhibited decreased heparin cofactor activity, and did not show enhanced tryptophan fluorescence upon addition of heparin. The third derivatives possessed high affinity for heparin-agarose, retained native-like heparin cofactor activity, and when titrated with heparin gave a 30-35% increase in tryptophan fluorescence. Fluorescence emission spectra of the phosphopyridoxyl-antithrombin derivative that does not bind to heparin-agarose indicated fluorescence energy transfer from tryptophan to the bound phosphopyridoxyl moiety. These results indicate that 1-2 lysines are essential to heparin bonding and that these residues may be located near to the critical tryptophan (Blackburn, M. N., and Sibley, C. C. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 824-826) in the heparin-binding domain of antithrombin III."
https://openalex.org/W1559999345,"A method has been developed for the purification of equine lutropin (eLH) and equine follitropin (eFSH) from horse pituitary glands which attains high yields of both hormones in contrast to previous methods that were devoted to one or the other with inferior recovery of the hormones. Two-pass chromatography over CM-Sephadex was used to separate eLH from eFSH. Subsequent steps employing QAE (quaternary amino-ethyl)-Sephadex chromatography and gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 produced highly purified hormone preparations. Yields of purified eLH and eFSH were 110 and 60 mg/kg of frozen pituitaries, respectively. Subunits were prepared by dissociation in 8 M guanidine HCl followed by either gel filtration (eLH) or gel filtration followed by QAE-Sephadex chromatography (eFSH). The hormones and their subunits were characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, amino acid analysis, NH2-terminal analysis, and by LH and FSH radioligand receptor assays."
https://openalex.org/W1480003911,"Mouse is defined as that form of isosafrole-induced P-450 in DBA/2N liver most specifically correlated with isosafrole metabolism. Isosafrole pretreatment does not induce aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity (cytochrome P1-450) in C57BL/6N or DBA/2N mice, induces acetanilide 4-hydroxylase activity (cytochrome P3-450) more than 3-fold in C57BL/6N but not in DBA/2N mice, and induces isosafrole metabolite formation more than 3-fold in both C57BL/6N and DBA/2N mice. P2-450 was, therefore, purified from isosafrole-treated DBA/2N liver microsomes having negligible amounts of contaminating P1-450 and P3-450. The apparent molecular weight of P2-450 is 55,000, and the protein appears homogeneous on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The Soret peak of the reduced purified cytochrome X CO complex is 448 nm. Purified P2-450, reconstituted in vitro, metabolizes acetanilide poorly and benzo[a]pyrene hardly at all. Anti-(P2-450) inhibits (90 to 100%) liver microsomal isosafrole metabolite formation, yet has no effect on aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase, acetanilide 4-hydroxylase, biphenyl 2- or 4-hydroxylase, or 7-ethoxycoumarin O-de-ethylase activities. 3-Methylcholanthrene induces anti-(P2-450)-precipitable protein about 12-fold in C57BL/6N and 2-fold in DBA/2N liver; 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (10 micrograms/kg), about 12-fold in both C57BL/6N and DBA/2N liver; isosafrole, more than 3-fold in both C57BL/6N and DBA/2N. Benzo[a]anthracene at maximal doses induces anti-(P2-450)-precipitable protein in C57BL/6N liver no more than 2-fold, yet is known to be a highly potent inducer of P1-450 mRNA in C57BL/6N liver. The sensitivity of the P2-450 induction process to isosafrole is inherited as an autosomal additive trait; studies of offspring from the C57BL/6N(DBA/N)F1 X DBA/2N backcross confirm involvement of the Ah locus or s closely segregating gene. In contrast, among crosses between C57BL/6N and DBA/2N, sensitivity of the P1-450 and P3-450 induction process to 3-methylcholanthrene or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. These data suggest that, although P1-450, P2-450, and P3-450 proteins are controlled by the Ah locus, either a P-450 protein polymorphism exists between C57BL/6N and DBA/2N mice or subtle differences may exist in the interaction of various inducers with Ah receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1567254149,"Abstract The substituents of the noncovalently associated heme prosthetic group of the bacterial nitrite reductase-cytochrome oxidase (EC 1.9.6.1 or EC 1.9.3.2.) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 19429) and Paracoccus denitrificans (ATCC 13456) have been identified. This was accomplished by 1H NMR, infrared, visible, and mass spectroscopic techniques applied to semi-purified heme and purified methyl ester derivatives of the iron-free porphyrin. The main structural features are as follows. 1) The macrocycle is a reduced porphyrin of the chlorin type, that is, one of the pyrrole rings has been saturated so that the beta-carbons have sp3-hybridization. 2) The chlorin is a tetracarboxylic acid. 3) The substituents of the saturated pyrrole ring are two methyl groups and two hydroxymethyl groups. 4) The substituents of the unsaturated pyrrole rings are: (i) two methyl groups (ii) a propionic acid (iii) an acrylic acid, and (iv) two directly bonded formic acid groups. No firm evidence has been obtained for the relative positions of these unsaturated beta-pyrrolic substituents around the macrocyclic ring, but a proposed structure will be discussed. Several previously inexplicable chemical properties of the heme in extracts or in the intact enzyme can be now interpreted in view of the proposed structure. The trivial name acrylochlorin is suggested for the macrocycle."

The enzyme is homogeneous when examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, is monomeric with a molecular mass of 23,000 Da, and contains a high proportion of hydrophobic amino acids and a single cysteine residue. At 30 degrees C, the turnover number is 88 min-1, and the Km values at pH 6 for 5-formyltetrahydrofolate and Mg-ATP are 0.6 and 1.0 microM, respectively. The enzyme is specific for (6S)-5-formyltetrahydrofolate, but ATP can be replaced by other nucleoside 5'-triphosphates with varying efficiency. The purified enzyme is markedly stabilized by the non-ionic detergent, Tween 20."

Subsequent bromoacetylation of the isolated amino bisphosphates gave reagents A and B (ribo and arabino epimers of 2-(4-bromoacetamido) anilino-2-deoxypentitol 1,5-bisphosphate) which were competitive inhibitors of the carboxylase with Ki values of 705 and 104 microM, respectively. Reagent A exhibited no time-dependent effects on the carboxylase in either the deactivated or activated state. Incubation of the enzyme with reagent B in the presence of the essential activators CO2 and Mg2+, however, resulted in an irreversible, time-dependent loss of activity, with a Kinact of 125 microM and a minimal half-time of 7.3 min. Covalent incorporation of [14C]reagent B was directly proportional to the loss of activity, with total inactivation correlating with an incorporation of 1.1 mol of reagent/mol of subunit. Inclusion of the competitive inhibitor 2-carboxyribitol 1,5-bisphosphate protected against inactivation with a concomitant reduction in incorporation. Neither reagent affected the activity of spinach carboxylase. Fractionation of [14C]reagent B-modified enzyme on DEAE-cellulose, subsequent to carboxymethylation and tryptic digestion, revealed two major radioactive peaks of approximately equal area. Digestion of each peak with alkaline phosphatase and rechromatography on DEAE-cellulose resulted in pure peptides I and II. The peptides were identical except in the site of labeling: peptide I contained a modified cysteinyl residue while peptide II contained a modified histidyl residue. Automated Edman degradation established the sequence as (sequence in text) which is located near the NH2 terminus of the enzyme. The lack of reactivity with the spinach enzyme is explained by the deletion of the histidyl residue and the replacement of cysteine by tryptophan in the eukaryotic species. Although the nonconservation of the modified residues argues against a functional role other than maintenance of structural integrity, the extensive homology in this region among seven different species of carboxylase is compatible with the region comprising a portion of the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1491643062,"Two major forms of human alpha-L-iduronidase have been individually purified over 175,000-fold to apparent homogeneity by sequential anion exchange, lectin affinity, and gel filtration chromatography. The two forms, initially designated as soluble and membrane-associated, were extracted from human lung in approximately equal amounts. Optimal solubilization of the membrane-associated form was facilitated by use of a non-ionic detergent or mannose 6-phosphate and saponin. Following detergent homogenization, the two forms were separated by anion exchange chromatography and then individually purified. The more electronegative form was membrane-associated, had a pI of approximately 5.9, and was selectively taken up (high uptake) by cultured Hurler syndrome fibroblasts; the more electropositive soluble form had a pI of about 6.6 and was incorporated into Hurler fibroblasts at a markedly lower rate (low uptake). After treatment with alkaline phosphatase, the pI values of both enzymes were about 7.8. Using 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-L-iduronide as substrate, the low and high uptake forms were each purified in milligram quantities to specific activities of 284,000 and 202,000 units/mg, respectively, with a combined yield greater than 35%. Each purified enzyme form migrated as a single protein band which also stained for enzymatic activity when electrophoresed in 7% native polyacrylamide disc gels at pH 4.3. By gel filtration, the high uptake form had an Mr = 85,000 whereas the Mr for the low uptake form was 68,000. Molecular weight estimates by analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were 82,000 and 70,000 for the high and low uptake forms, respectively. Rabbit anti-human low uptake alpha-L-iduronidase antibodies cross-reacted with the high uptake form as demonstrated by both immunotitration and Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion. Amino acid analysis revealed that the high uptake (higher molecular weight) form contained more arginine, glycine, alanine, glutamate or glutamine, leucine, isoleucine, histidine, and proline residues per molecule than the low uptake (lower molecular weight) form. Automated Edman degradation determined that the NH2-terminal residues of both forms were blocked. Both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and high performance liquid chromatography demonstrated that each purified form was composed of several components; each post-high performance liquid chromatographic component retained catalytic activity and was immunologically cross-reactive with antibodies against the low uptake form.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1539112821,"The compound 2-amino-4-oxo-6-acetyl-7,8-dihydro-3H,9H-pyrimido[4,5-b]-[1,4]diazepine (pyrimidodiazepine or PDA, for short) is a precursor of the red eye pigments called the drosopterins in Drosophila melanogaster. The precursor of PDA is 2-amino-4-oxo-6-(D-erythro-1',2',3'-trihydroxypropyl)-7,8-dihydrop teridine triphosphate (dihydroneopterin triphosphate or H2-NTP). The synthesis of of PDA from H2-NTP requires reduced glutathione, another thiol such as 2-mercaptoethanol, Mg2+, and at least three enzymes: one that is missing in the eye color mutant, sepia; one that is present only in limited quantities in the mutant, clot; and a third one that has been described as sepiapterin synthase A. The last enzyme is present only in relatively small quantities in the mutant, purple. Because PDA is two electrons more reduced than H2-NTP, it would appear that the reducing power needed for this transformation is probably supplied by glutathione. Oxidized glutathione cannot replace reduced glutathione in the system. The yield of PDA produced enzymatically from H2-NTP can be as high as 40% under optimal conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1534261810,"The catabolism of glycine in the isolated perfused rat liver was investigated by measuring the production of 14CO2 from [1-14C]- and [2-14C]glycine. Production of 14CO2 from [1-14C]glycine was maximal as the perfusate glycine concentration approached 10 mM and exhibited a maximal activity of 125 nmol of 14CO2 X g-1 X min-1 and an apparent Km of approximately 2 mM. Production of 14CO2 from [2-14C]glycine was much lower, approaching a maximal activity of approximately 40 nmol of 14CO2 X g-1 X min-1 at a perfusate glycine concentration of 10 mM, with an apparent Km of approximately 2.5 mM. Washout kinetic experiments with [1-14C]glycine exhibited a single half-time of 14CO2 disappearance, indicating one metabolic pool from which the observed 14CO2 production is derived. These results indicate that the glycine cleavage system is the predominant catabolic fate of glycine in the perfused rat liver and that production of 14CO2 from [1-14C]glycine is an effective monitor of metabolic flux through this system. Metabolic flux through the glycine cleavage system in the perfused rat liver was inhibited by processes which lead to reduction of the mitochondrial NAD(H) redox couple. Infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate or octanoate inhibited 14CO2 production from [1-14C]glycine by 33 and 50%, respectively. Alternatively, infusion of acetoacetate stimulated glycine decarboxylation slightly and completely reversed the inhibition of 14CO2 production by octanoate. Metabolic conditions which are known to cause a large consumption of mitochondrial NADPH (e.g. ureogenesis from ammonia) stimulated glycine decarboxylation by the perfused rat liver. Infusion of pyruvate and ammonium chloride stimulated production of 14CO2 from [1-14C]glycine more than 2-fold. Lactate plus ammonium chloride was equally as effective in stimulating glycine decarboxylation by the perfused rat liver, while alanine plus ammonium chloride was ineffective in stimulating 14CO2 production."
https://openalex.org/W1510426091,"Sedimentation equilibrium experiments with NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase showed that increasing 1-O-n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside levels promoted disaggregation of the flavoprotein. The reductase was monomeric at a molar ratio of detergent to protein above 10(3). Addition of N3-carboxymethyllumiflavin to the flavoprotein in the presence of 1-O-n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside results in photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (CIDNP) signals in the aromatic region. The CIDNP spectrum of the holoprotein shows sharp resonances due to histidine residues. On removal of FMN from the protein, CIDNP signals originating from a tyrosine residue appeared, suggesting that the tyrosine residue is exposed to solvent after the depletion of FMN. However, this tyrosine residue appears to become inaccessible to the external dye after full incubation of FMN-depleted reductase with FMN. This suggests that the tyrosine residue could be located in the vicinity of the FMN-binding domain which constitutes the active center of the reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1586072285,"The subcellular and intralobular distributions of a protein which specifically inhibits the proliferation of normal liver cells were determined in rat liver, using a combination of immunological and biochemical techniques. The IgG fraction from an antiserum raised against the hepatic proliferation inhibitor was isolated by protein A-Sepharose CL-4B chromatography and shown to be highly specific for the antigen using electroimmunodiffusion and affinity chromatography. To determine the intracellular location of the inhibitor, subcellular fractions were prepared from adult rat livers by differential centrifugation. The cytoplasmic fraction contained the biologically active cytostatic inhibitor, whereas the nuclear and mitochondrial fractions were inactive. Cytoplasmic localization of the hepatic proliferation inhibitor was further confirmed by anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography and by double immunodiffusion with the anti-hepatic proliferation inhibitor IgG. When liver sections were subjected to histochemical staining mediated through the immune IgG and an avidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex, the parenchymal liver cells were stained, but endothelial and connective tissue cells were not. Although some staining was evident throughout the liver parenchyma, the most intensely stained cells were located in the centrilobular region. Moreover, an age-dependent increase in the staining intensity and/or in the number of cells containing the proliferation inhibitor was observed. Preliminary experiments showed that little, if any, staining occurred in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. This highly specific IgG can be used to monitor alterations in the content and location of hepatic proliferation inhibitor in proliferative disorders of the liver."

However, no immunoprecipitation reaction was observed either between polynectin and anti-fibronectin antiserum, or between fibronectin and anti-polynectin antiserum prepared in the present experiments. No cross-reaction was found between fibronectin and polynectin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Immunohistochemical studies revealed the presence in abundance of polynectin in intestinal and gastric glands. It was found that the pattern of distribution of polynectin was entirely different from that of fibronectin. Polynectin, in contrast to fibronectin, exhibited no cell attachment-promoting effects on BHK-21, a baby hamster kidney cell line, and a cell line of human embryonic lung fibroblasts. In addition, changes in binding characteristics to affinity gels after reduction and alkylation differed between polynectin and fibronectin. Although both proteins appear to have similar carbohydrate chains in view of the similar reactivities with lectins, the results of the present experiments demonstrated that polynectin is entirely different from fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W1569842564,"The effects of ligand binding on antibody complex formation of Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase have been investigated. Binary complexes containing either substrate and inhibitors or NADP+ and NADPH together with ternary complexes containing inhibitors and coenzyme were examined. Whereas substrate and inhibitor binding alone show no effect, the binding of coenzyme reduces antibody complex formation. The most striking effect is observed with ternary complexes containing methotrexate or aminopterin and NADPH: maximal retention of the labeled protein in the immunoprecipitation assay is reduced to approximately 30% of its original value with dihydrofolate reductase alone due to a decrease in both the affinity and lifetime of the antibody-protein complex at one or more antigenic sites. This result is discussed in terms of different conformational changes brought about by NADP and NADPH."
