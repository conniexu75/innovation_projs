https://openalex.org/W2028191583,"The identity of floral organs in Arabidopsis thaliana is determined by homeotic genes, which are expressed in specific regions of the developing flower. The initial activation of homeotic genes is accomplished at least in part by the products of two earlier acting genes with overlapping functions. These are the floral meristem-identity genes LEAFY and APETALA1. The requirements of LEAFY and APETALA1 activity vary for different homeotic genes."
https://openalex.org/W2023147974,"A restudy of pareiasaurs reveals that these primitive reptiles are the nearest relatives of turtles. The two groups share numerous derived characters, such as a reduced presacral count, an acromion process, and a trochanter major, which are absent in other basal amniotes. Many traits long thought specific to chelonians also occur in pareiasaurs and must have evolved before the distinctive turtle shell appeared. Evidence uniting captorhinid or procolophonoids with turtles is shown to be weak. The phylogeny proposed here also suggests that certain features of the earliest turtle (Proganochelys) that have been interpreted as specializations, such as the large supratemporal and robust metacarpals, are primitive for turtles. In pareiasaurs, the osteoderms represent the precursors of the chelonian shell and the morphology of the anterior region is consistent with the idea that the shoulder girdle in turtles has migrated posteriorly into the rib cage."
https://openalex.org/W2067198315,"Airborne radar images of part of the Greenland ice sheet reveal icy terrain whose radar properties are unique among radar-studied terrestrial surfaces but resemble those of Jupiter's icy Galilean satellites. The 5.6- and 24-centimeter-wavelength echoes from the Greenland percolation zone, like the 3.5- and 13-centimeter-wavelength echoes from the icy satellites, are extremely intense and have anomalous circular and linear polarization ratios. However, the detailed subsurface configurations of the Galilean satellite regoliths, where heterogeneities are the product of prolonged meteoroid bombardment, are unlikely to resemble that within the Greenland percolation zone, where heterogeneities are the product of seasonal melting and refreezing."
https://openalex.org/W2132364829,"Volume diffusion models predict that crystals with large diffusion dimensions can record a wide range of thermal conditions in the Earth's crust. Direct measurements of the zoning of radiogenic argon-40 in single muscovite porphyroblasts, from a complex terrain in the Vermont Appalachians, record multiple crustal events that span 150 million years. The crystal radius was the effective dimension for argon diffusion (approximately 1000 micrometers). Late deformation features inside the crystals locally decreased the diffusion dimension and promoted loss of argon-40. Zoning patterns of radiogenic isotopes, as observed in this study, are an increasingly important diagnostic tool for studying the thermal record of tectonic processes."
https://openalex.org/W1976328449,"Current schemes for the mechanism of the photosynthesis reaction imply a two-part cycle; one part produces a strong photoreductant, the other functions to release molecular oxygen. Wild-type Scenedesmus exhibits the two light-induced electron-paramagnetic resonances typical of green algae and chloroplasts of higher plants. These resonances indicate the presence of unpaired electrons in at least two sites. By means of mutants which are blocked in one or the other part of the dual cycle, the narrow, rapidly decaying signal can be correlated with the photoreductant part, and the broad, slowly decaying signal can be correlated with the part releasing molecular oxygen."

https://openalex.org/W1981506931,"Thermal continuum emission from the Pluto-Charon system has been detected at wavelents of 800 and 1300 micrometers, and significant upper limits have been obtained at 450 and 1100 micrometers. After the subtraction of emission from Charon, the deduced surface temperature of much of Pluto is between 30 and 44 kein, probably near 35 to 37 kelvin. This range is significantly cooler than what radiative equilibrium models have suged and cooler than the surface temperature derived by the Infrared Astronomy Satellite. The low temperature indicates that methane cannot be present at the microbar pressure levels indicated by the 1988 stellar occultation measurements and that the methane features in Pluto's spectrum are from solid, not gas-phase, absorptions. This result is evidence that Pluto's atmosphere is dominated by nitrogen or carbon monoxide rather than methane."
https://openalex.org/W2093586669,Changing the strength of punishment produced only minor changes in rats' speed of running to food and shock at the goal of an alley. The persistence of running behavior after increased or decreased shock intensity is attributed to a stereotyped withdrawal response conditioned at the goal during initial punishment training.

https://openalex.org/W1971953548,"A luminous band around the night-time horizon, observed from orbiting capsules by J. H. Glenn and M. S. Carpenter, and identified as the horizon enhancement of the night airglow, is detected regularly in rocket-borne studies of night airglow. Values of luminance and dip angle of this band derived from Carpenter's observations agree remarkably well with values obtained from rocket data. The rocket results, however, do not support Carpenter's observation that the emission which he saw was largely the atomic oxygen line at 5577 A, but assign the principal luminosity to the green continuum."
