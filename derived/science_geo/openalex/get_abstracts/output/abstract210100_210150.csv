But the adolescent sons of high-ranking mothers may remain central and rise to high rank without becoming peripheral."

https://openalex.org/W2397242554,"The reactivity of groups in proteins may be studied in terms of their rates of reaction to form stable or unstable products or in terms of equilibria with small molecules or ions (2). The equilibria between cupric ions and peptides are of particular interest because of the stability and spectral properties of the complexes formed and the biological importance of the copper proteins. It has been found not only that Cu(I1) ion combines with the terminal amino group in dipeptides but that it may combine with the amide nitrogen at the same time with displacement of the proton from the amide nitrogen. The latter step is complete for dipeptides by pH 7, and very stable structures are formed (1, 3-6). Potentially, therefore, the NH2 terminus of a peptide chain in a protein may be a very strong binding site for Cu(I1) ion, probably surpassing the individual imidazole group or amino group (7). Titrations of mixtures of Cu(I1) ions with diglycylglycine and triglycylglycine have also indicated that the process of formation of Cu(II)-N bonds with displacement of the amide proton may continue through a second and even third peptide linkage, making possible an even more elaborate and stable complex between Cu(I1) and the first 3 or 4 residues in a peptide chain (8). The present report confirms the titration studies under the conditions of temperature and ionic strength used previously for the dipeptide studies and confirms directly the role of the second amide N atom by showing the effect of substitution of sarcosine residues in glycylglycylsarcosine and glycylsarcosylglycine. The ability of a Cu(II)-dipeptide complex bearing an additional hydroxyl ion coordinated to the Cu(I1) to catalyze the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate (1) has prompted the use of this catalytic test to confirm the displacement of amide protons instead of the additional coordination of hydroxyl ions in the Cu(II)-tripeptide and tetrapeptide systems. Last, the characteristics of the visible absorption spectra of the various complexes are tabulated, and a band in the ultraviolet region is described."

When sterile toxin produced in vitro was injected in sufficient amounts, monkeys died unless they were injected with specific antiserum. Death with symptoms of toxemia occurred within 2 hours after injection of 10(11) spores, whereas 10(10) spores or less required 20 or more hours of growth in vivo to cause death."

https://openalex.org/W1977126624,Cholinergic substance exists in homogenates of caudal neurosecretory storage organs of fish. The caudal organs of fresh-water fish contain about 10 times the amount found in caudal organs of marine fish. The substance in the caudal organ of the carp is more than 100 times as concentrated as that in the brain.

https://openalex.org/W2033794254,"In this study a set of decision rules was devised for interpreting profile patterns of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) of maladjusted and adjusted college students. The procedure used was that of computer programming of the ""maladjusted"" versus ""adjusted"" decisions of an expert test interpreter. The interpreter's decision-making processes were tape-recorded while he was thinking aloud during the sorting of the profiles of 126 college students. The programmed decision rules, which were based on the interpreter's protocol and which were improved upon by a process of trial-and-error statistical checking, yielded a greater hit percentage than the decisions of the original interpreter. In its final form, the set of objective configural inventory rules identified correctly large numbers of maladjusted college students in two cross-validation samples."

They work well in discrimination training, have a varied behavioral repertoire and social interaction, and seem to be at least as intelligent as M. mulatta. They are docile and submit readily to laboratory routine."

https://openalex.org/W1967491843,"GROUPS of 6–8 apparently healthy persons were exposed to three environmental conditions in a room previously described1. The test subjects were lightly dressed (about 343 g/m2 surface area, excluding shoes), seated and engaged in reading and writing. Though the subjects noted their comfort responses every half-hour, only the last votes of a 3-h session were considered. The conditions were: (a) air temperature approximately equal to mean radiant temperature ; (b) air temperature higher than mean radiant temperature (up to 17.9° F) ; (c) air temperature lower than mean radiant temperature (down to 15.3° F). Humidity was arbitrarily kept at 50 per cent, and air velocity was less than 20 ft./min. Dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures were measured with aspirated and shielded mercury-in-glass thermometers; radiant temperature with the globe thermometer2, a two-sphere radiometer3,4 and a modified thermopile5 ; and air velocity with a rhodium-plated kata thermometer6. All six room surfaces were kept at approximately the same temperature. The combinations of air temperature and mean radiant temperature were adjusted to yield a mean vote of ‘comfortable’ (‘4’) on a seven-point thermal comfort scale1. Mean votes, above and below ‘4’ which did not differ by more than 0.5 sensory units, were used as bases for finding, by linear interpolation, the air temperature and mean radiant temperature, which evoke a ‘comfortable’ vote."

https://openalex.org/W1551189501,"The conversion of galactose to glucose was studied by administering galactose labeled uniformly with C/sup 14/ and at position 4 with tritium to rats and examining glucose obtained from liver glycogen. The ratio of tritium to C/ sup 14/ in the isolated glucose was unchanged from that in the administered galactose, indicating that if the mechanism of conversion involved the participation of NAD/sup +/ in an oxidation-reduction process, the NAD/sup +/ must have been bound to the enzyme and brought about both the oxidation and the reduction. Other possible mechanisms of conversion are discussed from the viewpoint of binding by the enzyme of reactants in the conversion. (auth)"

https://openalex.org/W2090443001,"AMONG the chemical changes observed on radiolysis of compounds containing the peptide bond are those attributed1–3 to the production of unsaturated linkages which may be represented in terms of the tautomeric structures, ∼ CON = C(CH2R) ∼ ⇐ ∼ CONH—C(=CHR) ∼ . Compounds containing this type of chemical function have been designated dehydropeptides; such compounds are stable in water yet are readily hydrolysed to yield ammonia and a carbonyl product on heating in dilute mineral acid, ∼ CON = C(CH2R) ∼ + 2H2O → ∼ COOH + NH3 + RCH2CO ∼ (ref. 4). The experimental evidence for production of dehydropeptides in the radiolysis of proteins and simpler peptide systems has recently been reviewed5. Identification has been based primarily on studies of the formation of ammonia and carbonyl function during hydrolysis of the irradiated peptide system. For example, the hydrolytic production of ammonia and pyruvic acid from γ-irradiated acetylalanine (solid, evacuated) has been found to parallel very closely the hydrolytic degradation of authentic acetyldehydroalanine."
