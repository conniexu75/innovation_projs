Roychowdhury et al. found that cadmium doping of silver antimony telluride enhances cationic ordering, which simultaneously improves electric properties and helpfully decreases thermal conductivity (see the Perspective by Liu and Ibáñez). This strategy markedly improves thermoelectric properties and could be used for other materials. Science , this issue p. 722 ; see also p. 678"
https://openalex.org/W3127664280,"To address how the microbiome might modify the interaction between diet and cardiometabolic health, we analyzed longitudinal microbiome data from 307 male participants in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, together with long-term dietary information and measurements of biomarkers of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism and inflammation from blood samples. Here, we demonstrate that a healthy Mediterranean-style dietary pattern is associated with specific functional and taxonomic components of the gut microbiome, and that its protective associations with cardiometabolic health vary depending on microbial composition. In particular, the protective association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and cardiometabolic disease risk was significantly stronger among participants with decreased abundance of Prevotella copri. Our findings advance the concept of precision nutrition and have the potential to inform more effective and precise dietary approaches for the prevention of cardiometabolic disease mediated through alterations in the gut microbiome."

Ba et al. overcame previous data constraints and found that Hispanic and Black officers make far fewer stops and arrests and use force less than white officers, especially against Black civilians. These differences are largest in majority-Black neighborhoods in the city of Chicago (see the Perspective by Goff). Female officers also use less force than male officers. These effects are supportive of the efficacy of increasing diversity in police forces. Science , this issue p. 696 ; see also p. 677"

Tied into this cycle are the building and erosion of high mountains, which are tied to collisions between tectonic plates. Tang et al. use europium anomalies in zircons to estimate the mean thickness of crust over Earth's history. This proxy shows that mountain building has not always been as active as it is today or as it was very early in Earth's history. Mountain building, and the subsequent erosion, was less intense for about a billion years, roughly correlated with a so-called “boring billion” period of biological evolution.

https://openalex.org/W3128953197,"Birds display advanced behaviors, including vocal learning and problem-solving, yet lack a layered neocortex, a structure associated with complex behavior in mammals. To determine whether these behavioral similarities result from shared or distinct neural circuits, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize the neuronal repertoire of the songbird song motor pathway. Glutamatergic vocal neurons had considerable transcriptional similarity to neocortical projection neurons; however, they displayed regulatory gene expression patterns more closely related to neurons in the ventral pallium. Moreover, while γ-aminobutyric acid-releasing neurons in this pathway appeared homologous to those in mammals and other amniotes, the most abundant avian class is largely absent in the neocortex. These data suggest that songbird vocal circuits and the mammalian neocortex have distinct developmental origins yet contain transcriptionally similar neurons."
https://openalex.org/W3128443681,"The evolutionarily conserved splicing regulator neuro-oncological ventral antigen 1 (NOVA1) plays a key role in neural development and function. NOVA1 also includes a protein-coding difference between the modern human genome and Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes. To investigate the functional importance of an amino acid change in humans, we reintroduced the archaic allele into human induced pluripotent cells using genome editing and then followed their neural development through cortical organoids. This modification promoted slower development and higher surface complexity in cortical organoids with the archaic version of NOVA1 Moreover, levels of synaptic markers and synaptic protein coassociations correlated with altered electrophysiological properties in organoids expressing the archaic variant. Our results suggest that the human-specific substitution in NOVA1, which is exclusive to modern humans since divergence from Neanderthals, may have had functional consequences for our species' evolution."

To study these machines, Sudhakar et al. developed germanium semiconductor nanospheres as probes for so-called optical tweezers. With these high–refractive index nanospheres, they improved the resolution of optical tweezers and discovered that the motor kinesin takes 4-nanometer substeps. Further, instead of detaching from their microtubule track under load, motors slid back on it, enabling rapid reengagement in transport.

Aging causes significant changes to the skeleton, characterized by a decrease in bone formation and an increase in marrow adiposity (Fan et al., 2017Fan Y. Hanai J.-I. Le P.T. Bi R. Maridas D.

Age-related bone loss is a critical risk factor for osteoporosis that affects millions of patients worldwide. Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disease and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the expanding aging population. In skeletal aging and osteoporosis, there is an inverse relationship between bone mass and marrow adiposity. Bone-marrow adipose tissue (MAT) accumulation is increased at the expense of bone formation (Burge et al., 2007Burge R. Dawson-Hughes B. Solomon D.H. Wong J.B. King A. Tosteson A.

Moreover, increased MAT accumulation and lower bone density are also hallmark symptoms of patients with radiation therapy and chemotherapy, or with type 1 diabetes (Naveiras et al., 2009Naveiras O. Nardi V. Wenzel P.L. Hauschka P.V. Fahey F. Daley G.Q.

Therefore, it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms that control the switch between bone and fat in the bone marrow. Bone marrow MSCs (also known as mesenchymal stem cells or skeletal stem cells) are believed to be the common progenitors for both osteoblasts and adipocytes in bone marrow, but commitment to these two lineages is mutually exclusive (Bianco et al., 2013Bianco P.

Aging reduces the bone-marrow MSC number and its self-renewal and inclines their differentiation into adipocytes at the expense of osteoblasts (Kawai and Rosen, 2010Kawai M. Rosen C.J.

Over the past decade, several transcription factors or signaling pathways have been identified in association with MSC fate commitment and differentiation (Akune et al., 2004Akune T. Ohba S.

For example, the master osteogenic factor runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) was found to be a critical factor for MSC fate determination. Induction of RUNX2 inhibits adipogenesis while promoting osteogenesis (Chen et al., 2016Chen Q. Shou P. Zheng C. Jiang M. Cao G. Yang Q. Cao J. Xie N. Velletri T.

Marrow fat and bone--new perspectives.J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2013; 98: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Parathyroid hormone (PTH) coordinates with the WNT/β-catenin and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/Smad signaling pathways to regulate MSC fate and differentiation (Crane and Cao, 2014Crane J.L. Cao X. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and TGF-β signaling in bone remodeling.J. Clin. Invest. 2014; 124: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar; Wu et al., 2010Wu X. Pang L. Lei W.

However, while these transcription factors and pathways have been found to govern switches between bone and fat, how epigenetic factors control skeletal aging remains poorly understood. Epigenetic mechanisms play a critical role in aging, stem cell identity, and fate. Stem cell exhaustion and epigenetic alteration are two of the hallmarks of aging (Sen et al., 2016Sen P. Shah P.P. Nativio R. Berger S.L. Epigenetic Mechanisms of Longevity and Aging.Cell. 2016; 166: 822-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Both histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) hypermethylation and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) recruitment are hallmarks of heterochromatin formation. The loss of the heterochromatin model of aging implicates that aging is associated with a loss of constitutive heterochromatin and cell senescence by decreasing H3K9me3 levels and delocalizing HP1 proteins (Nacarelli et al., 2017Nacarelli T. Liu P. Zhang R. Epigenetic Basis of Cellular Senescence and Its Implications in Aging.Genes (Basel). 2017; 8: 343Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In a premature aging disorder model of Werner syndrome, it was found that knockin of catalytically inactive suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1 (SUV39H1), a main H3K9me3 methyltransferase in MSCs, reduced H3K9me3 levels and accelerated MSC aging and replicative senescence in vitro (Zhang et al., 2015Zhang W. Li J. Suzuki K. Qu J. Wang P. Zhou J. Liu X. Ren R. Xu X. Ocampo A. et al.Aging stem cells. A Werner syndrome stem cell model unveils heterochromatin alterations as a driver of human aging.Science. 2015; 348: 1160-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). On the contrary, some studies suggest that senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF; heterochromatin gain) are associated with cell aging, but most of these studies focus on oncogenic transformation (Narita et al., 2003Narita M. Nũnez S. Heard E. Narita M. Lin A.W. Hearn S.A. Spector D.L. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. Rb-mediated heterochromatin formation and silencing of E2F target genes during cellular senescence.Cell. 2003; 113: 703-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). These two models are controversial in the field of aging, and there is very little genetic evidence that proves or disproves these models. We previously found that histone lysine demethylase 4B (KDM4B), a H3K9me3 demethylase, plays a critical role in osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, implying that erasing H3K9me3 may be required for bone formation in vivo (Ye et al., 2012Ye L. Fan Z. Yu B. Chang J. Al Hezaimi K. Zhou X. Park N.-H. Wang C.-Y. Histone demethylases KDM4B and KDM6B promotes osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 11: 50-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To explore the functional role of KDM4B in skeletal development and aging, we generated Kdm4b knockout mice. We generated conditional Kdm4b knockout mice in which the fifth exon containing the characteristic Jumonji domain (JMJD) was deleted in MSCs using Prx1Cre (Logan et al., 2002Logan M. Martin J.F. Nagy A. Lobe C. Olson E.N. Tabin C.J. Expression of Cre recombinase in the developing mouse limb bud driven by a Prxl enhancer.Genesis. 2002; 33: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) confirmed that Kdm4b was efficiently deleted in MSCs (Sca1+CD29+CD45–CD11b–) isolated from Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f mice compared to Prx1Cre;Kdm4bw/w littermates (Figure 1A). Unexpectedly, Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f mice were born normally and had no differences in size, weight, or growth compared to Prx1Cre;Kdm4bw/w littermates. The whole-mount skeletal staining and histological analysis did not detect any developmental defects of craniofacial or long bones in neonatal Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f mice at P0 (Figures S1A–S1D). Recently, we showed that loss of Kdm4b in adipose tissues did not affect the adipocyte differentiation but reduced the energy expenditure and caused obesity (Cheng et al., 2018Cheng Y. Yuan Q. Vergnes L. Rong X. Youn J.Y. Li J. Yu Y. Liu W. Cai H. Lin J.D. et al.KDM4B protects against obesity and metabolic dysfunction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115: E5566-E5575Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To further confirm our previous work on MSCs, we isolated MSCs from 3-month-old Prx1Cre;Kdm4bw/w and Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f mice and determined their lineage-specific differentiation potentials in vitro. Consistent with our previous findings, the deletion of Kdm4b in MSCs significantly impaired osteogenic differentiation (Figures S1E and S1F) as indicating by decreased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, alizarin red S (ARS) staining, and mRNA level of osteogenic makers and promoted adipogenic differentiation of MSCs in vitro by increased oil red O staining and mRNA level of adipogenic markers (Figures S1G and S1H). Colony forming units-osteoblast (CFU-OB) assay and colony forming units-adipocyte (CFU-AD) assay also confirmed loss of KDM4B promoted the MSC commitment to adipogenic lineage at the expense of osteogenic lineage (Figures S1I and S1J). To further confirm that loss of KDM4B altered lineage commitments of MSCs, Sca1+CD29+CD45–CD11b– MSCs from both Prx1Cre;Kdm4bw/w and Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f mice were sorted and seeded on 96-well plates to form individual clones. 16 to 20 individual clones from each mouse were picked after 2 weeks and then subjected them to osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation immediately. To minimize in vitro passages, half of the individual clones were utilized for ARS and oil red O staining, and the other half were used for gene expression studies. To rigidly test MSC lineage commitment, we induced osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of MSCs with a mix of osteogenic and adipogenic induction medium (1: 1 ratio) as previously described by other groups (Fu et al., 2010Fu J. Wang Y.-K. Yang M.T. Desai R.A. Yu X. Liu Z. Chen C.S. Mechanical regulation of cell function with geometrically modulated elastomeric substrates.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar; McBeath et al., 2004McBeath R. Pirone D.M. Nelson C.M. Bhadriraju K. Chen C.S. Cell shape, cytoskeletal tension, and RhoA regulate stem cell lineage commitment.Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3303) Google Scholar). ARS staining and oil red O staining demonstrated that all individual MSC clones from Kdm4b−/− mice exhibited a decrease in osteogenesis and an increase in adipogenesis compared with all clones from Kdm4b+/+ mice upon induction (Figures S1K–S1N). qRT-PCR found that, while the expression of osteogenic markers, Runx2 and Bglap, was significantly downregulated in Kdm4b−/− MSCs compared with Kdm4b+/+ MSCs, the expression of adipogenic markers, Pparg and Zfp423, was significantly upregulated in Kdm4b−/− MSCs (Figures S1O and S1P). Recently, Hif1a and Mef2a have been identified as key pro-osteogenic and anti-adipogenic transcription factors that control MSC fate (Rauch et al., 2019Rauch A. Haakonsson A.K. Madsen J.G.S. Larsen M. Forss I. Madsen M.R. Van Hauwaert E.L. Wiwie C. Jespersen N.Z. Tencerova M. et al.Osteogenesis depends on commissioning of a network of stem cell transcription factors that act as repressors of adipogenesis.Nat. Genet. 2019; 51: 716-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We found that Hif1a and Mef2a were significantly reduced in Kdm4b−/− MSCs compared to Kdm4b+/+ MSCs (Figure S1Q). Interestingly, in contrast to the lack of any defects in bone development, Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f mice displayed an accelerated age-related bone loss. With age advancing from 3 to 18 months, micro-computed tomography (μCT) analysis revealed a significantly greater decrease in both bone mineral density (BMD) and bone volume fraction (BV/TV) in Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f mice compared to Prx1Cre;Kdm4bw/w mice of mixed genders (Figures 1B and 1C). The 12- and 18-month-old Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f mice had significantly lower trabecular numbers (Tb.N) and greater trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp) than age-matched controls (Figure 1D). In addition, osteoblasts were also significantly reduced in 12- and 18-month-old Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f mice compared to age-matched Prx1Cre;Kdm4bw/w mice (Figures 1E and 1F). Furthermore, we performed a 7-day dynamic histomorphometric analysis using tetracycline labeling to determine whether the accelerated bone loss was due to decreased bone formation. The mineral apposition rate (MAR) and bone formation rate (BFR) in 12- and 18-month-old Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f mice were significantly reduced compared to age-matched Prx1Cre;Kdm4bw/w mice (Figure 1G). Moreover, loss of Kdm4b also promoted cortical bone loss and increased porosity with age advancing from 3 to 18 months (Figures 1H and 1I). Prx1Cre is not expressed in the axial skeleton (Figures S2A and S2B) (Salazar et al., 2019Salazar V.S. Capelo L.P. Cantù C. Zimmerli D. Gosalia N. Pregizer S. Cox K. Ohte S. Feigenson M. Gamer L. et al.Reactivation of a developmental Bmp2 signaling center is required for therapeutic control of the murine periosteal niche.eLife. 2019; 8: e42386Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), so, to examine potential indirect effects of loss of Kdm4b in bone, we measured the bone mass in vertebrae (lumbar 4, L4) of Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f and Prx1Cre;Kdm4bw/w mice. We did not observe significant differences in vertebral bone mass and MAT between aged Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f and Prx1Cre;Kdm4bw/w mice (Figures S2C–S2F). In addition, osteoclasts were not affected by the deletion of KDM4B in MSCs (Figures S2G and S2H). The serum concentrations of procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), but not collagen type I c-telopeptide (CTX), were significantly lower in Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f mice than in Prx1Cre;Kdm4bw/w (Figure S2I). On the contrary, the number of adipocytes was significantly increased and MAT accumulation in the bone marrow was accelerated in aged Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f mice compared to Prx1Cre;Kdm4bw/w mice (Figures 1J and 1K). The distribution and regulation of in the bone marrow is region specific and is classified as constitutive MAT (cMAT) and regulated MAT (rMAT). While cMAT is relatively stable, rMAT responds to aging, hormone, and environmental cues. The proximal tibia and distal femur contain predominantly rMAT (Scheller et al., 2015Scheller E.L. Doucette C.R. Learman B.S. Cawthorn W.P. Khandaker S. Schell B. Wu B. Ding S.-Y.

To further evaluate the region-specific effect of Kdm4b deletion on the formation of MAT, mouse tibial bone-marrow lipids were stained with osmium-tetroxide as described previously (Scheller et al., 2014Scheller E.L. Troiano N. Vanhoutan J.N. Bouxsein M.A. Fretz J.A. Xi Y. Nelson T. Katz G. Berry R. Church C.D. et al.Use of osmium tetroxide staining with microcomputerized tomography to visualize and quantify bone marrow adipose tissue in vivo.Methods Enzymol. 2014; 537: 123-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). μCT analysis revealed that there was a significant increase in rMAT in the proximal tibia of aged Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f mice compared to Prx1Cre;Kdm4bw/w littermates (Figures 1L and 1M). Moreover, the independent analysis of aged male and female mice also found that loss of KDM4B significantly promoted bone loss and MAT accumulation in both male and female mice (Figure S3). To mimic the pathogenesis of osteoporotic bone loss, we performed ovariectomy (OVX) on female Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f and Prx1Cre;Kdm4bw/w mice to induce estrogen deficiency. As expected, μCT analysis found noticeable trabecular bone loss in Prx1Cre;Kdm4bw/w mice compared to sham controls 5 weeks after OVX. However, bone loss in Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f mice was significantly higher than in Prx1Cre;Kdm4bw/w mice (Figures 2A and 2B ). Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f mice had more significantly decreased Tb.N and increased Tb.Sp compared to Prx1Cre;Kdm4bw/w mice following OVX (Figure 2C). Histomorphometric analysis showed that OVX-induced increase in osteoblast number and osteoblast surface were significantly suppressed in Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f mice compared to Prx1Cre;Kdm4bw/w mice (Figures 2D and 2E). Tetracycline labeling showed that the upregulated MAR and BFR, induced by OVX, were significantly blunted in Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f mice (Figure 2F), suggesting that loss of KDM4B suppressed the compensatory increase in bone formation after OVX. Osteoclast formation induced by OVX was not affected by loss of KDM4B in MSCs (Figure 2G). The serum concentration of P1NP and CTX further revealed that the increased net bone loss after OVX in Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f mice was caused by decelerating bone formation (Figure 2H). OVX significantly increased adipogenesis and MAT accumulation in Prx1Cre;Kdm4bw/w mice. However, adipocyte numbers and MAT accumulation were significantly greater in Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f mice than in Prx1Cre;Kdm4bw/w mice following OVX (Figures 2I and 2J). To further determine that KDM4B plays a key role in bone-fat switch in vivo, we generated Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f;tdTomato mice that expressed tdTomato in the Prx1Cre recombined cells, including osteoblasts and adipocytes (Madisen et al., 2010Madisen L. Zwingman T.A. Sunkin S.M. Oh S.W. Zariwala H.A. Gu H. Ng L.L. Palmiter R.D. Hawrylycz M.J. Jones A.R. et al.A robust and high-throughput Cre reporting and characterization system for the whole mouse brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3579) Google Scholar). OVX was then performed on both Prx1Cre;Kdm4bw/w;tdTomato and Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f;tdTomato mice. The exacerbation of adipocyte accumulation was validated by immunostaining for the adipocyte marker fatty-acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4). All FABP4+ adipocytes were tdTomato-positive, confirming that adipocytes were differentiated from Prx1Cre-recombined MSCs. tdTomato+/FABP4+ adipocytes and MAT accumulation in Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f;tdTomato mice were significantly increased, compared to the Prx1Cre;Kdm4bw/w;tdTomato mice following OVX (Figures 2K and 2L). To further confirm our results, we generated Prx1Cre/ERT2;Kdm4bf/f;tdTomato and Prx1Cre/ERT2;Kdm4bw/w;tdTomato mice, which allowed us to label new MSC-derived osteoblasts and adipocytes upon tamoxifen treatment. Immediately after OVX, tamoxifen was injected to induce tdTomato expression in Prx1-expressing MSCs. Similarly, the number of tdTomato+/FABP4+ adipocytes in Prx1Cre/ERT2;Kdm4bf/f;tdTomato mice was significantly greater compared to that in Prx1Cre/ERT2;Kdm4bw/w;tdTomato mice upon OVX. Of note, the small number of tdTomato–FABP4+ adipocytes in bone marrow were formed before tamoxifen injection and OVX, and their numbers did not differ between Prx1Cre/ERT2;Kdm4bf/f;tdTomato mice and Prx1Cre/ERT2;Kdm4bw/w;tdTomato mice (Figures 2M and 2N). μCT analysis of osmium-stained tibiae further confirmed the significant increase in rMAT in the proximal tibia of Prx1Cre/ERT2;Kdm4bf/f;tdTomato mice, compared to the littermates (Figures 2O and 2P). MSCs in adult bone marrow specifically express the leptin receptor (LepR). In vivo lineage tracing has demonstrated that LepR+ MSCs are progenitors for both osteoblasts and adipocytes in adult mice (Yue et al., 2016Yue R. Zhou B.O. Shimada I.S. Zhao Z. Morrison S.J.

To further confirm that loss of Kdm4b promoted bone loss and MAT accumulation, we generated LepRCre;Kdm4bf/f;tdTomato mice that expressed tdTomato in the LepRCre recombined cells, including osteoblasts and adipocytes. qRT-PCR confirmed that LepRCre efficiently deleted Kdm4b in MSCs (Figure S4A). OVX was then performed on both LepRCre;Kdm4bw/w;tdTomato mice and LepRCre;Kdm4bf/f;tdTomato mice. As expected, μCT analysis found that OVX-induced trabecular bone loss in LepRCre;Kdm4bw/w;tdTomato mice was significantly higher than in sham controls. However, bone loss in LepRCre;Kdm4bf/f;tdTomato mice was significantly exacerbated compared to LepRCre;Kdm4bw/w;tdTomato mice following OVX as determined by μCT and histological analysis (Figures S4B–S4G). Deletion of Kdm4b by LepRCre did not affect OVX-induced osteoclasts (Figure S4H) . The merged immunofluorescent staining of FABP4 and tdTomato images confirmed that the FABP4-expressing adipocytes were differentiated from LepR+ MSCs. As predicted, OVX significantly induced adiposity as evidenced by an increase in adipocyte numbers and adipose tissue area in LepRCre;Kdm4bw/w;tdTomato mice. However, OVX-induced increase in adipocyte numbers and adipose tissue areas in LepRCre;Kdm4bf/f;tdTomato mice were significantly higher than in LepRCre;Kdm4bw/w;tdTomato mice (Figures S4I and S4J). μCT analysis revealed that there was a significant increase in rMAT accumulation in the proximal tibia of LepRCre;Kdm4bf/f;tdTomato mice compared to LepRCre;Kdm4bw/w;tdTomato following OVX (Figures S4K and S4L). In vitro differentiation assays also confirmed the deletion of Kdm4b by LepRCre promoted adipogenic differentiation of MSCs at the expense of osteogenic differentiation (Figures S4M–S4R).Figure 4KDM4B is required for PTH-mediated anabolic actions by controlling β-catenin/Smad1-mediated transcriptionShow full caption(A) Representative μCT images of 12-month-old Prx1Cre;Kdm4bw/w and Prx1Cre;Kdm4bf/f mouse femurs following PTH treatment.

In the present study, a retrospective analysis was performed in a cohort of 306 confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to Tongji hospital (Wuhan, China) from February 10 to March 15, 2020. Whole blood levels of essential and/or toxic metal(loid)s were analyzed, including magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, thallium, and lead according to the disease severity and outcome. Compared to the non-severe COVID-19 patients, severe cases showed significant higher levels of whole blood calcium, chromium, and copper, but lower levels of magnesium, manganese, iron, zinc, arsenic, thallium, and lead. These differences were further found consistently across the clinical course since the disease onset by longitudinal analysis. Among the severe patients, chromium and cadmium were higher in the deceased group compared to the recovered group, while arsenic was lower. Whole blood iron, age, and sex were determined to be independent factors associated with the disease severity, while chromium, cadmium, and the comorbidity of cardiovascular disease were determined to be independent factors associated with the mortality. These results suggest that variations of whole blood metal(loid)s may be associated with the severe illness and fatal outcome of COVID-19, which could be persistently monitored and would be helpful in the evaluation of the dynamic changes in patients with COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3128827688,"We report the catalytic stereocontrolled synthesis of dinucleotides. We have demonstrated, for the first time to our knowledge, that chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysts control the formation of stereogenic phosphorous centers during phosphoramidite transfer. Unprecedented levels of diastereodivergence have also been demonstrated, enabling access to either phosphite diastereomer. Two different CPA scaffolds have proven to be essential for achieving stereodivergence: peptide-embedded phosphothreonine-derived CPAs, which reinforce and amplify the inherent substrate preference, and C2-symmetric BINOL-derived CPAs, which completely overturn this stereochemical preference. The presently reported catalytic method does not require stoichiometric activators or chiral auxiliaries and enables asymmetric catalysis with readily available phosphoramidites. The method was applied to the stereocontrolled synthesis of diastereomeric dinucleotides as well as cyclic dinucleotides, which are of broad interest in immuno-oncology as agonists of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway."

Galaxy bulges may assemble later via mergers or internal evolution. Here we present submillimeter observations (with spatial resolution of 700 parsecs) of ALESS 073.1, a starburst galaxy at redshift z~5, when the Universe was 1.2 billion years old. This galaxy's cold gas forms a regularly rotating disk with negligible noncircular motions. The galaxy rotation curve requires the presence of a central bulge in addition to a star-forming disk. We conclude that massive bulges and regularly rotating disks can form more rapidly in the early Universe than predicted by models of galaxy formation."

Human cancer evolution models could help illuminate this process and inform therapeutic intervention at an early disease stage, but their creation has faced significant challenges. Here, we combined induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and CRISPR-Cas9 technologies to develop a model of the clonal evolution of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Through the stepwise introduction of three driver mutations, we generated iPSC lines that, upon hematopoietic differentiation, capture distinct premalignant stages, including clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), culminating in a transplantable leukemia, and recapitulate transcriptional and chromatin accessibility signatures of primary human MDS and AML. By mapping dynamic changes in transcriptomes and chromatin landscapes, we characterize transcriptional programs driving specific transitions between disease stages. We identify cell-autonomous dysregulation of inflammatory signaling as an early and persistent event in leukemogenesis and a promising early therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W3095598180,"Beta-amyloid (Aβ) has been recognized as an early trigger in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) leading to synaptic and cognitive impairments. Aβ can alter neuronal signaling through interactions with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), contributing to synaptic dysfunction in AD. The three major nAChR subtypes in the hippocampus are composed of α7-, α4β2-, and α3β4-nAChRs. Aβ selectively affects α7- and α4β2-nAChRs, but not α3β4-nAChRs in hippocampal neurons, resulting in neuronal hyperexcitation. However, how nAChR subtype selectivity for Aβ affects synaptic function in AD is not completely understood. Here, we showed that Aβ associated with α7- and α4β2-nAChRs but not α3β4-nAChRs. Computational modeling suggested that two amino acids in α7-nAChRs, arginine 208 and glutamate 211, were important for the interaction between Aβ and α7-containing nAChRs. These residues are conserved only in the α7 and α4 subunits. We therefore mutated these amino acids in α7-containing nAChRs to mimic the α3 subunit and found that mutant α7-containing receptors were unable to interact with Aβ. In addition, mutant α3-containing nAChRs mimicking the α7 subunit interact with Aβ. This provides direct molecular evidence for how Aβ selectively interacted with α7- and α4β2-nAChRs, but not α3β4-nAChRs. Selective coactivation of α7- and α4β2-nAChRs also sufficiently reversed Aβ-induced AMPA receptor dysfunction, including Aβ-induced reduction of AMPA receptor phosphorylation and surface expression in hippocampal neurons. Moreover, costimulation of α7- and α4β2-nAChRs reversed the Aβ-induced disruption of long-term potentiation. These findings support a novel mechanism for Aβ's impact on synaptic function in AD, namely, the differential regulation of nAChR subtypes."

https://openalex.org/W3126542125,"Background Nasal High Flow (NHF) therapy delivers flows of heated humidified gases up to 60 LPM (litres per minute) via a nasal cannula. Particles of oral/nasal fluid released by patients undergoing NHF therapy may pose a cross-infection risk, which is a potential concern for treating COVID-19 patients. Methods Liquid particles within the exhaled breath of healthy participants were measured with two protocols: (1) high speed camera imaging and counting exhaled particles under high magnification (6 participants) and (2) measuring the deposition of a chemical marker (riboflavin-5-monophosphate) at a distance of 100 and 500 mm on filter papers through which air was drawn (10 participants). The filter papers were assayed with HPLC. Breathing conditions tested included quiet (resting) breathing and vigorous breathing (which here means nasal snorting, voluntary coughing and voluntary sneezing). Unsupported (natural) breathing and NHF at 30 and 60 LPM were compared. Results Imaging: During quiet breathing, no particles were recorded with unsupported breathing or 30 LPM NHF (detection limit for single particles 33 μm). Particles were detected from 2 of 6 participants at 60 LPM quiet breathing at approximately 10% of the rate caused by unsupported vigorous breathing. Unsupported vigorous breathing released the greatest numbers of particles. Vigorous breathing with NHF at 60 LPM, released half the number of particles compared to vigorous breathing without NHF. Chemical marker tests: No oral/nasal fluid was detected in quiet breathing without NHF (detection limit 0.28 μL/m 3 ). In quiet breathing with NHF at 60 LPM, small quantities were detected in 4 out of 29 quiet breathing tests, not exceeding 17 μL/m 3 . Vigorous breathing released 200–1000 times more fluid than the quiet breathing with NHF. The quantities detected in vigorous breathing were similar whether using NHF or not. Conclusion During quiet breathing, 60 LPM NHF therapy may cause oral/nasal fluid to be released as particles, at levels of tens of μL per cubic metre of air. Vigorous breathing (snort, cough or sneeze) releases 200 to 1000 times more oral/nasal fluid than quiet breathing (p &lt; 0.001 with both imaging and chemical marker methods). During vigorous breathing, 60 LPM NHF therapy caused no statistically significant difference in the quantity of oral/nasal fluid released compared to unsupported breathing. NHF use does not increase the risk of dispersing infectious aerosols above the risk of unsupported vigorous breathing. Standard infection prevention and control measures should apply when dealing with a patient who has an acute respiratory infection, independent of which, if any, respiratory support is being used.

https://openalex.org/W3128527973,"γ-Secretase is responsible for the proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are centrally implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The biochemical mechanism of how processing by γ-secretase is regulated, especially as regards the interaction between enzyme and substrate, remains largely unknown. Here, mutagenesis reveals that the hydrophilic loop-1 (HL-1) of presenilin-1 (PS1) is critical for both γ-secretase step-wise cleavages (processivity) and its allosteric modulation by heterocyclic γ-modulatory compounds. Systematic mutagenesis of HL-1, including all of its familial AD mutations and additional engineered variants, and quantification of the resultant Aβ products show that HL-1 is necessary for proper sequential γ-secretase processivity. We identify Y106, L113, and Y115 in HL-1 as key targets for heterocyclic γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) to stimulate processing of pathogenic Aβ peptides. Further, we confirm that the GxxxG domain in the APP transmembrane region functions as a critical substrate motif for γ-secretase processivity: a G29A substitution in APP-C99 mimics the beneficial effects of GSMs. Together, these findings provide a molecular basis for the structural regulation of γ-processivity by enzyme and substrate, facilitating the rational design of new GSMs that lower AD-initiating amyloidogenic Aβ peptides. γ-Secretase is responsible for the proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are centrally implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

Extensive biochemical, cell biological, and structural studies of presenilin suggest that γ-secretase processing requires at least six steps to achieve hydrolysis of the peptide bonds of a transmembrane substrate: 1) initial γ-secretase activation through the auto-proteolysis of presenilin-1 or -2 (PS1, PS2); 2) substrate TMD docking to γ-secretase; 3) substrate TMD unwinding and binding to the di-aspartyl active site; 4) the initial endopeptidase (ε) cleavage of the substrate, leading to either Aβ48 or Aβ49 production line; 5) successive carboxypeptidase-like (γ) cleavages (i.e., “trimming” or “γ-processivity” (4Bolduc D.M.

Moreover, HL-1 is a hot spot of familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) PS1 mutations (20 known AD-causing mutations within 34 residues) (https://www.alzforum.org/mutations). Although recent advances in cryo-EM analyses of γ-secretase have provided important structural information about the relative positions of the PS1 TMDs and many of their individual amino acids (7Lu P.

Moreover, recent cryo-EM modeling of a substrate (APP) bound to the protease (PS1) was based on cystine cross-linking between artificial mutations PS1 Q112C within HL-1 and APP-C83 V8C (10Zhou R. Yang G. Guo X. Zhou Q. Lei J. Shi Y. Recognition of the amyloid precursor protein by human γ-secretase.Science. 2019; 363Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar), suggesting that HL-1 would likely have been constrained in a nonnative conformation in this engineered, covalently bound complex. In addition, one of the two catalytic aspartates of PS1 had necessarily been mutated to an inactive alanine to stabilize the artificial complex. Therefore, a detailed biochemical study of this HL-1 region is essential to further our understanding of native γ-secretase enzymatic function. To this end, we have analyzed all individual residues (aa 101–120) of HL-1 of PS1 with regard to 1) the enzymatic activity of the FAD mutations therein as well as the effects of alanine scanning mutagenesis (Ala substitutions at each residue within this region); 2) the performance of five γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) of two general classes on Aβ generation from the HL-1 FAD-mutant residues; and 3) the response of these GSMs to the Ala substitutions. Moreover, we explored the mechanism of GSMs by examining the function of the GxxxG domain in the APP transmembrane region and found that G29 (Aβ numbering) is a key residue for proper γ-secretase processivity. The combined data provide unexpected mechanistic details of the structural regulation of γ-processivity in a way that should facilitate the rational development of novel GSMs for treating and preventing AD. Taking advantage of our new, sensitive immunoassays (11Liu L. Ding L. Rovere M. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. A cellular complex of BACE1 and γ-secretase sequentially generates Aβ from its full-length precursor.J. Cell Biol. 2019; 218: 644-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that detect and quantify virtually all secreted Aβ C-terminal variants (Aβ43, 42, 40, 38, and 37), we were able to quantify γ-secretase processivity to identify the pathogenic profiles of all FAD PS1 mutations located in HL-1 (aa 101–120; see protein sequence in Fig. 1A). First, we used CRISPR/Cas9 on HEK293 cells to generate PS1/2 double knockout (dKO) cells in order to eliminate endogenous PS activity. The best dKO line obtained had no detectable PS1-NTF or PS1-CTF and almost no PS2 expression (Fig. 1B); as a result, the proper maturation (N+O-linked glycosylation) of the nicastrin (NCT) component of γ-secretase was prevented, as expected (12Leem J.Y. Vijayan S. Han P. Cai D. Machura M. Lopes K.O. Veselits M.L. Xu H. Thinakaran G. Presenilin 1 is required for maturation and cell surface accumulation of nicastrin.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19236-19240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Next, we generated PS1 constructs for all 17 known FAD mutations within the HL-1 region (see amino acid sequence in Fig. 1A) and transiently coexpressed them in the HEK293 PS dKO line together with wt human APP. We then analyzed the resultant conditioned media (CM). Quantification of the secreted Aβ species in CM showed that compared with wt-PS1, 1) 15 of 16 FAD mutations decreased total secreted Aβs (i.e., combining the 43, 42, 40, 38, and 37 peptide values); 2) all 16 mutations increased the Aβ42/40 ratio in the CM, as expected; and 3) all 16 mutations decreased Aβ37/40, Aβ37/42, and Aβ38/42 ratios (Fig. 1C). Among these, the most severe mutation, T116 R, a) increased Aβ42/40–684% of that in wt PS1 transfectants; b) decreased Aβ37/42 and Aβ38/42 by 90% and 94% below wt, respectively; and c) increased Aβ43 eightfold of the wt level. Moreover, the proteolytic shifts underlying the changes in ratios differed mechanistically among the various FAD mutations compared with wt PS1. For example, 1) Y115H increased Aβ42 production at the expense of Aβ37 and 38 while Aβ40 production remained the same as wt-PS1; 2) Y115H resulted in 21.9% more total secreted Aβ peptides than with wt PS1; 3) T116R increased Aβ42 and 43 production at the expense of Aβ37, 38 and 40; 4) T116R led to 31.5% less total Aβ secreted than did wt PS1; and 5) P117S increased Aβ42 and 43 production at the expense of Aβ37 and 40, but Aβ38 was only moderately decreased by 26%. Considering the complexities in PS1:APP conformational changes that could alter the sequential cleavages, there could be 1) a “product line” switch between Aβ48 and Aβ49 as the initial ε-cleavages of the APP TMD; 2) reduced processivity toward the final products Aβ37 and Aβ38 through a loosened interaction between PS1 enzyme and APP substrate. Moreover, in a prior report (11Liu L. Ding L. Rovere M. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. A cellular complex of BACE1 and γ-secretase sequentially generates Aβ from its full-length precursor.J. Cell Biol. 2019; 218: 644-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we tested a HEK293 line stably expressing Y115H and observed similar elevated Aβ42/40 ratios: 0.71 for that stable line and 0.63 for the current transient transfectant, so this markedly increased Aβ42/40 ratio from Y115H occurred consistently across experiments. To our knowledge, such altered profiles of γ-processivity among FAD-causing PS1 mutants (Fig. 1C) are detailed here for the first time, namely the measurement of all five C-terminal variants of secreted Aβ to unveil the diverse effects of PS1 mutations. Of special pathogenic significance, the Aβ42/40, Aβ37/42, and Aβ38/42 ratios each correlated strongly and significantly with the reported age of onset (AOO) of clinical impairment across these 16 FAD mutations (Fig. 1D). The tightest correlation occurred with the Aβ37/42 ratio, which comprises the ratio of the shortest to the second longest secreted Aβ peptides, thus ideally reflecting the efficiency of progressive carboxypeptidase trimming (processivity) by PS1 (Fig. 1D). These findings contrast with an earlier study of 138 FAD mutations that used an in vitro biochemical reaction; the authors did not find a correlation of Aβ42/40 to AOO when recombinant γ-secretase complexes (with wt versus mutant PS1) were used to generate Aβ peptides from recombinant APP substrates in vitro (13Sun L. Zhou R. Yang G. Shi Y. Analysis of 138 pathogenic mutations in presenilin-1 on the in vitro production of Aβ42 and Aβ40 peptides by γ-secretase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: E476-E485Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We speculate that the discrepancy arises because the in vitro paradigm is not an optimal system to analyze a range of FAD mutations, in that 68 out of 138 mutant recombinant PS1 enzymes the authors tested showed <10% of the Aβ40 + 42 production than did wt PS1/γ-secretase (13Sun L. Zhou R. Yang G. Shi Y. Analysis of 138 pathogenic mutations in presenilin-1 on the in vitro production of Aβ42 and Aβ40 peptides by γ-secretase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: E476-E485Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This cleavage inefficiency suggests that a reconstituted in vitro γ-secretase assay system is not sufficiently native and robust to discern pathogenically meaningful differences among many PS FAD mutations. In contrast, in our in vivo cellular assay system, we were able to compare almost all secreted Aβ peptides, allowing us to observe a strong correlation between the patients’ AOO and three different Aβ ratios that reflect the details of γ-processivity. This system will be expanded to test more mutations in other regions of PS1 to further validate our findings. Here, we continued to explore the HL-1 region of PS1. Next, to deeply probe the structure:function relationship of the HL-1 region, we generated a library of variants that change each amino acid of HL-1 from residue 101 to 120 into alanine(Ala) and expressed these Ala mutants in the PS1/2 dKO HEK cells along with wt-APP. Analysis of secreted Aβs in the CM of these transient transfectants in the dKO cells (Fig. 2, A–C) showed that: 1) eight variants have Aβ production profiles similar to that of wt-PS1 (K101A, S102A, V103A, S104A, R108A, K109A, D110A, E119A), which is reasonable as none of these eight variants are known to be pathogenic; 2) 12 variants have different Aβ production profiles than wt-PS1 and can be categorized into three groups having increased processivity (Y106A), decreased processivity (F105A, T107A, G111A, Q112A, Y115A, T116A, P117A, F118A, E120A,), or other (L113A, I114A). Then, we analyzed each group to interrogate the mechanism for these diverse enzymological effects. Compared with wt PS1, Y106A underwent enhanced γ-processivity as reflected by: a) no change in total secreted Aβ species: the sum of Aβ42 + 40 + 38 + 37 from Y106A decreased only 4.7% versus wt levels; b) decreases in Aβ42 by 25.8% and Aβ40 by 13.1%; and c) increases in Aβ37 by 132.3% and Aβ38 by 46.6%. Thus, for Y106A, the Aβ42/40 ratio decreased 14% while the Aβ37/40, Aβ37/42, and Aβ38/42 ratios increased to 169%, 214%, and 98% of wt PS1 transfectants, respectively. Next, we found that Ala substitutions F105A, T107A, G111A, Q112A, Y115A, T116A, P117A, F118A, and E120A all lead to different degrees of reduced γ-processivity, as shown by increased Aβ42/40 ratio and decreased Aβ37/40, Aβ37/42, and Aβ38/42 ratios simultaneously. Interestingly, P117A is actually an FAD mutation, and accordingly, it showed the strongest reduction in γ-processivity among all of our 20 Ala substitutions (Fig. 2C). Moreover, four of these nine variants having decreased γ-processivity were at residues harboring FAD mutations. Within the third category, L113A showed partially enhanced γ-processivity along the Aβ 49–46–43–40–37 product line, as reflected by a) increasing the total level of secreted Aβs by 19.1%; b) increasing Aβ37 to 218% and Aβ40 to 112% of wt PS1 production levels, while decreasing Aβ43 to 25% of the wt PS1 level; and c) inhibiting the Aβ 48–45–42–38 product line to yield decreased Aβ38 to 31.6% and increased Aβ42 to 171.3% of wt PS1 (Fig. 1C). The distinct effects of substituting Y106 vs. L113 with alanine exemplify the complex regulation of γ-processivity by the fine structure of presenilin, revealing distinctive pathways of tri-, tetra-, and penta-peptide trimming. Meanwhile, I114A showed a change of end-products between Aβ37 and Aβ38, in which I114A increased Aβ38 production and decreased Aβ37, without changing Aβ40 or 42 (Fig. 2A). To expand our discovery regarding the criticality of Y106 and L113 for γ-processivity, we generated six more substitutions for Y106 (P, T, R, E, F, or L) and for L113 (Q, T, R, E, F, or I). Using the same experimental setup, we show in Fig. S1A that among these 12 new variants, only Y106T could obviously enhance γ-processivity, with an increment of Aβ38/42 ratio by 136.7% compared with wild-type PS1. From the seven total substitutions at Y106 and L113 respectively, it is difficult to observe a pattern to provide more information on the structure–activity relationship, besides the general importance of the two natural residues (Y; L) for γ-processivity. In addition, we found that Ala variants at the C-terminal region of HL1 (116, 117, 118, 119, and 120) significantly reduced γ-processivity, which concurs with these residues being hot spots for FAD mutations (Fig. 1A). The latter findings suggest that γ-processivity is also sensitive to changes in the conformation of the C-terminal region of HL1. Collectively, the detailed findings from FAD mutants and alanine scanning mutagenesis indicate that the HL-1 region has a major modulatory effect on proper γ-processivity, in accord with certain prior reports (5Takagi-Niidome S.

We next examined whether HL-1 is the responsible part of PS1 for the effects of γ-secretase modulators (GSM), as prior evidence has shown that Y106 could serve as a binding site of PS1 to E2012, a potent heterocyclic GSM developed by Eisai. Since the surprising discovery of sulindac sulphide and two other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that reduced Aβ42 production from cells (15Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P. Sagi S.A. Wang R. Pietrzik C.U. Findlay K.A. Smith T.E. Murphy M.P. Bulter T. A subset of NSAIDs lower amyloidogenic Aβ42 independently of cyclooxygenase activity.Nature. 2001; 414: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar), hundreds of compounds have been generated to modulate γ-secretase activity allosterically with the goal to enhance γ-processivity toward the shorter end products, Aβ 38 and 37, an effect similar to that of Y106A, which we observed above. Current GSMs are divided into two broad classes of compounds: the NSAID (acidic) type and the heterocyclic (nonacidic) type (16Johnson D.S. Li Y.M. Pettersson M. St George-Hyslop P.H. Structural and Chemical Biology of presenilin complexes.Cold Spring Harb Perspect. Med. 2017; 7: a024067Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We tested the performance of three acidic GSMs (GSM-1, TC-E 5006, and JNJ-40418677) and two heterocyclic GSMs (E2012 and sGSM-40) (17Wagner S.L. Zhang C. Cheng S. Nguyen P. Zhang X. Rynearson K.D. Wang R. Li Y. Sisodia S.S. Mobley W.C. Tanzi R.E. Soluble γ-secretase modulators selectively inhibit the production of the 42-amino acid amyloid β peptide variant and augment the production of multiple carboxy-truncated amyloid β species.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 702-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Analysis of the abundantly secreted Aβs generated by sw-APP cells (HEK293 cells stably expressing the “Swedish” FAD-causing APP mutation) was accomplished by treating these cells with serial doses of each of these five GSM compounds. All five GSMs decreased Aβ42 and 39 while increasing Aβ38 levels, compared with DMSO-treated sw-APP cells. The two nonacidic (heterocyclic) GSMs and JNJ-40418677 also decreased Aβ40 and increased Aβ37, whereas GSM-1 or TC-E 5006 did not (Fig. 3), consistent with a previous report (18Crump C.J. Johnson D.S. Li Y.-M. Development and mechanism of γ-secretase modulators for Alzheimer’s disease.Biochemistry. 2013; 52: 3197-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These distinct effects on Aβ profiles suggest differential structural modulation of PS1 by different GSMs. To discern the maximal effects of the GSMs, we applied each at 5 μM [the highest dose tested in the sw-APP cells (Fig. 3)] to dKO 293 cells coexpressing wt-APP with each of our Ala-substituted HL-1 variants and collected the CM for 12 h. Analysis of the four secreted Aβ peptides (Aβ37, 38, 40, 42) showed that Y106A blunted the modulatory effects of the nonacidic but not the acidic GSMs as regards decreasing Aβ42 and 40 and increasing Aβ37 and 38 (Fig. 4). A prior report had studied E2012 effects on a deletion of residues 101–110 (11Liu L. Ding L. Rovere M. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. A cellular complex of BACE1 and γ-secretase sequentially generates Aβ from its full-length precursor.J. Cell Biol. 2019; 218: 644-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); our results more precisely demonstrate that Y106 is a critical functional residue for not only E2012 but also another nonacidic (heterocyclic) modulator, sGSM-40, whereas two of the acidic GSMs, GSM-1 and TC-E 5006, but not JNJ-40418677, still worked on Y106A. Substitutions L113A and Y115A also subtly but significantly blunted the modulatory effect of the nonacidic GSMs, as reflected by the changes in the Aβ42/40 and Aβ37/42 ratios upon treatment (Fig. S1B). Thus, PS1 variants responded to five GSMs differently, suggesting that GSMs have multiple binding sites or orientations. Y106, L113, and Y115 could be residues critical for heterocyclic-type GSM binding to PS1. Previous studies suggested that GSM-1 and another acidic GSM, NS-1017, could bind to the TMD-1 of PS1 to confer modulatory activity (19Ohki Y. Higo T. Uemura K. Shimada N. Osawa S. Berezovska O. Yokoshima S. Fukuyama T. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Phenylpiperidine-type γ-secretase modulators target the transmembrane domain 1 of presenilin 1.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we also generated a library of variants that substitute alanines (Ala) into residues 85–99 of the transmembrane domain-1 (TMD-1) region. We expressed these ten Ala-substituted variants with wt-APP in PS1-dKO cells and collected the CM for 12 h of treatment with 5 μM of each GSM. Analysis of Aβ42 secreted from these cells showed that none of the ten Ala variants blunted the effects of the five GSMs (Fig. S2). From these data, TMD1 is unlikely to be the binding site of these 5 GSMs, including GSM-1, which is reasonable in that a highly helical and hydrophobic transmembrane region is less exposed to extracellular compounds compared with the HL-1 region. Although we have little knowledge of the binding sites for acidic GSMs, our findings above do indicate the critical roles of the HL-1 region of PS1 for γ-processivity and response to heterocyclic GSMs. Allosteric modulation of the γ-secretase processing of APP into shorter Aβs involves the interactions of enzyme (presenilin) and substrate (APP). Multiple lines of evidence have also shown that γ-secretase processivity can be governed by the affinity between PS1 and APP. Within the juxtamembrane and transmembrane region of APP, there are three GxxxG motifs from amino acid 25 to 37 (Aβ numbering), a motif that was first reported to be important for possible dimerization of the TMD (20Munter L.M. Voigt P. Harmeier A. Kaden D. Gottschalk K.E. Weise C. Pipkorn R. Schaefer M. Langosch D. Multhaup G. GxxxG motifs within the amyloid precursor protein transmembrane sequence are critical for the etiology of Abeta42.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1702-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Though recent cryo-EM (10Zhou R. Yang G. Guo X. Zhou Q. Lei J. Shi Y. Recognition of the amyloid precursor protein by human γ-secretase.Science. 2019; 363Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and biochemical (21Higashide H. Ishihara S. Nobuhara M. Ihara Y. Funamoto S. Alanine substitutions in the GXXXG motif alter C99 cleavage by γ-secretase but not its dimerization.J. Neurochem. 2017; 140: 955-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) data have ruled out a dimerized APP TMD as an active substrate, the GxxxG motif has instead been reported to be important for γ-secretase processivity (21Higashide H. Ishihara S. Nobuhara M. Ihara Y. Funamoto S. Alanine substitutions in the GXXXG motif alter C99 cleavage by γ-secretase but not its dimerization.J. Neurochem. 2017; 140: 955-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), in that the helix-breaking property of glycines could drive the premature release of longer Aβ peptides from the enzyme complex (relevant APP sequence is shown in Fig. 5A). To focus on the processing of APP-βCTF into Aβ, we generated constructs to express this APP-C99 substrate (WT, G29A, and G33A). First, we expressed each of these three constructs in HEK293 cells and measured Aβs secreted into the CM (Fig. 5B, left panel). Compared with WT, G29A C99 led to dramatic increases in production of shorter Aβ peptides (Aβ37 and 38), decreased production of longer Aβs (Aβ40 and 42), and little change in Aβ39 production. This finding shows that G29A enhances γ-processivity, corroborating previous reports (20Munter L.M. Voigt P. Harmeier A. Kaden D. Gottschalk K.E. Weise C. Pipkorn R. Schaefer M. Langosch D. Multhaup G. GxxxG motifs within the amyloid precursor protein transmembrane sequence are critical for the etiology of Abeta42.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1702-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 21Higashide H. Ishihara S. Nobuhara M. Ihara Y. Funamoto S. Alanine substitutions in the GXXXG motif alter C99 cleavage by γ-secretase but not its dimerization.J. Neurochem. 2017; 140: 955-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to earlier findings (20Munter L.M. Voigt P. Harmeier A. Kaden D. Gottschalk K.E. Weise C. Pipkorn R. Schaefer M. Langosch D. Multhaup G. GxxxG motifs within the amyloid precursor protein transmembrane sequence are critical for the etiology of Abeta42.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1702-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), G33A yielded much lower Aβ production overall. After calculating various ratios between Aβ peptides, we found G29A-C99 shares the same profile as Y106A-PS1, namely decreased Aβ42/40 ratio and increased Aβ37/40, 37/42, 38/42, and 39/42 ratios (Fig. 5B, right panel), indicating an improved processivity toward shorter peptides. We further explored the complexity of enzyme/substrate interactions by expressing PS1 (WT or Y106A) with APP-C99 (WT or G29A) in the dKO cells (Fig. 5C). Here, we found that G29A-C99/Y106A-PS1 synergistically generated even more Aβ37 and less Aβ40 and 42 than either G29A-C99 or Y106A-PS1 alone. Thus, there was an unexpected amplification effect from altered substrate plus altered enzyme, each of which produces enhanced processivity alone, as represented by the further decrease in Aβ 42/40 ratio (42% of WT-C99/WT-PS1) and increase in Aβ 37/42 ratio (12-fold of WT-C99/WT-PS1), (Fig. 5D). This finding further indicates the importance of proper enzyme:substrate interaction for beneficial γ-secretase processing. We then asked whether G29A-C99 and a GSM would act similarly on PS1. Here, we generated a library of 22 FAD PS1 mutations to test the effects of G29A-C99 or a GSM. Within the library, we included FAD mutants known to be resistant to GSMs (L166P and N135S) (22Kretner B. Fukumori A. Gutsmiedl A. Page R.M. Luebbers T. Galley G. Baumann K. Haass C. Steiner H. Attenuated Aβ42 responses to low potency γ-secretase modulators can be overcome for many pathogenic presenilin mutants by second-generation compounds.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 15240-15251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and also the aforementioned T116R and L113P). The dKO cells were cotransfected with one of these 22 FAD PS1 mutants or WT PS1 together with a) WT-C99 (and treated with 5 μM E2012) or b) G29A-C99 (and treated with DMSO). The Aβ42/40 ratio from the WT-C99/WT-PS1/DMSO-treated cultures was normalized to 1, and the Aβ42/40 ratios from the two groups (a or b) were compared (Fig. 5E). We found that for the 22 mutations, G29A-C99 and E2012 showed similar Aβ effects in the presence of the PS1 FAD mutations (Pearson correlation p= 0.0011). We also identified 11 out of 22 mutations as having variable resistance to the effects of E2012, and 16 out of 22 mutations as having variable resistance to the effects of G29A-C99. When we set a criterion for this resistance of <25% lowering of the Aβ42/40 ratio by G29A-C99 or by E2012, we could categorize these resistant FAD mutations into two groups: group 1 wi"

Critics argue that current research assessments focus on productivity and that they increase unhealthy pressures on scientists. Yet, the precise ways in which assessments should change is still open for debate. We circulated a survey with Flemish researchers to understand how they work, and how they would rate the relevance of specific indicators used in research assessments. We found that most researchers worked far beyond their expected working schedule. We also found that, although they spent most of their time doing research, respondents wished they could dedicate more time to it and spend less time writing grants and performing other activities such as administrative duties and meetings. When looking at success indicators, we found that indicators related to openness, transparency, quality, and innovation were perceived as highly important in advancing science, but as relatively overlooked in career advancement. Conversely, indicators which denoted of prestige and competition were generally rated as important to career advancement, but irrelevant or even detrimental in advancing science. Open comments from respondents further revealed that, although indicators which indicate openness, transparency, and quality (e.g., publishing open access, publishing negative findings, sharing data, etc.) should ultimately be valued more in research assessments, the resources and support currently in place were insufficient to allow researchers to endorse such practices. In other words, current research assessments are inadequate and ignore practices which are essential in contributing to the advancement of science. Yet, before we change the way in which researchers are being assessed, supporting infrastructures must be put in place to ensure that researchers are able to commit to the activities that may benefit the advancement of science."

Additionally, the CTCs short-term dynamics were compared with the clinical course of the HCC-patients. Blood samples from 17 patients with HCC who underwent MWA (n = 10) or C-TACE (n = 7) were analyzed. Venous blood was taken before and immediately after the radiological interventions to isolate and quantify CTCs using flow cytometry. CTCs were identified as CD45- and positive for the markers ASGPR, CD146 and CD274 (PD-L1). Patients were followed of up to 2.2 years after the radiological intervention. CTCs were detected in 13 HCC patients (76%) prior to the radiological interventions. The rate of CTCs was significantly decreased after the intervention in patients treated with MWA (0.4 CTCs/mL of blood, p = 0.031). However, no significant differences were observed in patients who received C-TACE (0.3 CTCs/mL of blood, p = 0.300). Overall, no correlation was found between the CTCs rate before and after the radiological intervention and recurrence rate of HCC. This preliminary data could confirm the tumoricidal effects of MWA in patients with HCC by significantly decreasing CTCs rate. In our study, we were able to detect CTCs in HCC patients using 3 different tumor markers. This preliminary data shows significant lower CTCs detected in response to MWA. However, large-scale randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the future role and the prognostic relevance of CTCs following this treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3128570802,"Glyphosate (GLY) is worldwide one of the most used active substances in non-selective herbicides. Although livestock might be orally exposed via GLY-contaminated feedstuffs, not much is known about possible hepatotoxic effects of GLY. As hepatic xenobiotic and nutrient metabolism are interlinked, toxic effects of GLY residues might be influenced by hepatic nutrient supply. Therefore, a feeding trial with lactating dairy cows was conducted to investigate effects of GLY-contaminated feedstuffs and different concentrate feed proportions (CFP) in the diets as tool for varying nutrient supply to the liver. For this, 61 German Holstein cows (207 ± 49 days in milk; mean ± standard deviation) were either fed a GLY-contaminated total mixed ration (TMR, GLY groups, mean GLY intake 122.7 μg/kg body weight/day) or control TMR (CON groups, mean GLY intake 1.2 μg/kg body weight/day) for 16 weeks. Additionally, both groups were further split into subgroups fed a lower (LC, 30% on dry matter basis) or higher (HC, 60% on dry matter basis) CFP resulting in groups CON HC (n = 16), CON LC (n = 16), GLY HC (n = 15), GLY LC (n = 14). Blood parameters aspartate aminotransferase, γ-glutamyltransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase, cholesterol, triglyceride, total protein, calcium, phosphorus, acetic acid and urea and histopathological evaluation were not influenced by GLY, whereas all mentioned parameters were at least affected by time, CFP or an interactive manner between time and CFP. Total bilirubin blood concentration was significantly influenced by an interaction between GLY and CFP with temporarily elevated concentrations in GLY HC , whereas the biological relevance remained unclear. Gene expression analysis indicated 167 CFP-responsive genes, while seven genes showed altered expression in GLY groups compared to CON groups. Since expression changes of GLY-responsive genes were low and liver-related blood parameters changed either not at all or only slightly, the tested GLY formulation was considered to have no toxic effects on the liver of dairy cows."
https://openalex.org/W3126798314,"Background HIV-infected men have higher rates of delayed diagnosis, reduced antiretroviral treatment (ART) retention and mortality than women. We aimed to assess, by gender, the first two UNAIDS 90 targets in rural southern Mozambique. Methods This analysis was embedded in a larger prospective cohort enrolling individuals with new HIV diagnosis between May 2014-June 2015 from clinic and home-based testing (HBT). We assessed gender differences between steps of the HIV-cascade. Adjusted HIV-community prevalence was estimated using multiple imputation (MI). Results Among 11,773 adults randomized in HBT (7084 female and 4689 male), the response rate before HIV testing was 48.7% among eligible men and 62.0% among women (p&lt;0.001). MI did not significantly modify all-age HIV-prevalence for men but did decrease prevalence estimates in women from 36.4%to 33.0%. Estimated proportion of HIV-infected individuals aware of their status was 75.9% for men and 88.9% for women. In individuals &lt;25 years, we observed up to 22.2% disparity in awareness of serostatus between genders. Among individuals eligible for ART, similar proportions of men and women initiated treatment (81.2% and 85.9%, respectively). Fourfold more men than womenwere in WHO stage III/IV AIDS at first clinical visit. Once on ART, men had a twofold higher 18-month loss to follow-up rate than women. Conclusion The contribution of missing HIV-serostatus data differentially impacted indicators of HIV prevalence and of achievement of UNAIDS targets by age and gender and men were missing long before the second 90. Increased efforts to characterize missing men and their needs will and their needs will allow us to urgently address the barriers to men accessing care and ensure men are not left behind in the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets achievement."

It consists of a kinase cascade, in which MST1/2 and MAP4Ks phosphorylate and activate LATS1/2, which in turn phosphorylate and inhibit YAP/TAZ activity. A variety of signals can modulate LATS1/2 kinase activity to regulate Hippo pathway. However, the full mechanistic details of kinase-mediated regulation of Hippo pathway signaling remain elusive. Here, we report that TNF activates LATS1/2 and inhibits YAP/TAZ activity through MEKK2/3. Furthermore, MEKK2/3 act in parallel to MST1/2 and MAP4Ks to regulate LATS1/2 and YAP/TAZ in response to various signals, such as serum and actin dynamics. Mechanistically, we show that MEKK2/3 interact with LATS1/2 and YAP/TAZ and phosphorylate them. In addition, Striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex associates with MEKK3 via CCM2 and CCM3 to inactivate MEKK3 kinase activity. Upstream signals of Hippo pathway trigger the dissociation of MEKK3 from STRIPAK complex to release MEKK3 activity.

The LATS1/2 activity is central to the Hippo pathway. MST1/2 are not absolutely required for the regulation of LATS1/2.

NUAK2 is a critical YAP target in liver cancer.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 4834Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Previously, we found that inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF or IL-1β, trigger LATS1/2 phosphorylation and YAP/TAZ degradation (29Deng Y. Lu J. Li W. Wu A. Zhang X. Tong W. Ho K.K. Qin L. Song H. Mak K.K. Reciprocal inhibition of YAP/TAZ and NF-kappaB regulates osteoarthritic cartilage degradation.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). How LATS1/2 are activated by TNF remains elusive. In this study, we identified MEKK2 (encoded by MAP3K2) and MEKK3 (encoded by MAP3K3) as the kinases responsible for the TNF-induced LATS activation. MEKK2/3 are serine/threonine kinases belonging to the MAP3K family. MEKK2/3 are capable of activating multiple downstream MAPKs, including ERK1/2, JNK, MAPK/ERK5, and p38 (30Cuevas B.D. Abell A.N. Johnson G.L. Role of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases in signal integration.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3159-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). MEKK3 has also been reported to play a critical role in TNF-induced NF-κB activation (31Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Cheng J. Huang J. Deng L. Liao W. Chen Z. Liu Z. Su B. The essential role of MEKK3 in TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation.Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In addition, the activation of MEKK3-KLF2/4 pathway contributes to CCM (cerebral cavernous malformations) disease (32Zhou Z. Tang A.T. Wong W.Y. Bamezai S. Goddard L.M. Shenkar R. Zhou S. Yang J.

Sanches M. Tate S. Larsen B. Gibson L.C. Derry W.B. Scott I.C. Pelletier L. Baillie G.S. Sicheri F. Gingras A.C. Structure-function analysis of core STRIPAK Proteins: A signaling complex implicated in Golgi polarization.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25065-25075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recently, STRIPAK protein complex has been demonstrated to integrate upstream signals to control the association and phosphorylation of MST1/2 and MAP4Ks, thus initiating Hippo signaling (37Chen R. Xie R. Meng Z. Ma S. Guan K.L. STRIPAK integrates upstream signals to initiate the Hippo kinase cascade.Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21: 1565-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here, we showed that MEKK2/3 interact with LATS1/2 and promote their activation in response to various upstream signals. Furthermore, MEKK3 associates with STRIPAK complex through CCM2 and CCM3. Our study suggests that MEKK2/3 mediate TNF and various signals-induced LATS activation to regulate the Hippo pathway. We previously found that TNF stimulates LATS kinase activation in primary chondrocytes (29Deng Y. Lu J. Li W. Wu A. Zhang X. Tong W. Ho K.K. Qin L. Song H. Mak K.K. Reciprocal inhibition of YAP/TAZ and NF-kappaB regulates osteoarthritic cartilage degradation.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To further investigate the underlying mechanism, we first examined the phosphorylation status of LATS at hydrophobic motif, which is essential for LATS kinase activity using anti-phospho LATS1-T1079/LATS2-T104 antibody in TNF-stimulated HEK293A (Fig. 1A), NIH3T3 (Fig. 1B), and lung cancer cell A549 (Fig. S1A). The phosphorylation of NF-κB subunit p65 validated the successful activation of NF-κB signaling in the TNF-treated HEK293A and NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). The phosphorylation of LATS1/2 and YAP-S127 (a LATS phosphorylation site) was increased in HEK293A, NIH3T3, and A549 cells (Fig. 1, A and B and Fig. S1A). The phosphorylation of MOB1 Threonine 35 (MOB1-T35) by MST1/2 was unchanged (Fig. 1, A and B). YAP/TAZ protein levels decreased in conjunction with increased LATS1/2 and YAP phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A and B), which suggests that TNF elicits LATS activation and subsequent YAP/TAZ inactivation independent of MST1/2. MAP4K family members (MAP4K1/2/3 and MAP4K4/6/7) and MST1/2 have been demonstrated to act direct LATS-activating kinases. The deletion of MAP4Ks and MST1/2 eliminates most of LATS-targeted YAP phosphorylation induced by various signals. Surprisingly, TNF still induced robust LATS phosphorylation and YAP/TAZ degradation in MM 8KO (combined deletion of MST1/2 and MAP4K1/2/3/4/6/7) HEK293A cells (Fig. 1C), indicating the existence of additional LATS-activating kinases to mediate TNF-induced LATS activation. To test the dependency of LATS phosphorylation on TNF/NF-κB signaling, we generated RIPK1 KO HEK293A cells using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. It has been shown that Ripk1−/− MEF cells fail to activate NF-κB in response to TNF stimulation (38Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. The death domain kinase RIP mediates the TNF-induced NF-kappaB signal.Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Indeed, the phosphorylation of p65 was not activated by TNF treatment in RIPK1 KO HEK293A cells (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, the deletion of RIPK1 blocked TNF-induced phosphorylation of LATS and YAP (Fig. 1D). Previously, we showed that TAK1 is involved in TNF-induced inactivation of YAP independent LATS1/2. TAK1 functions as a pivotal activator to mediate the activation of NF-κB (39Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. TAK1 is a ubiquitin-dependent kinase of MKK and IKK.Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 40Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. The kinase TAK1 can activate the NIK-I kappaB as well as the MAP kinase cascade in the IL-1 signalling pathway.Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). However, whether TAK1 is required for TNF-induced LATS1/2 activation remains unknown. To test this, we generated Tak1 KO NIH3T3 cells using CRISPR/Cas9. TNF still induced LATS and YAP phosphorylation in Tak1 KO NIH3T3 cells (Fig. S1B). Furthermore, serum starvation and actin depolymerization stimulated LATS and YAP phosphorylation in Tak1 KO NIH3T3 cells similar as in control cells (Fig. S1, C and D). These results suggest that TNF stimulates LATS kinase activity and the putative LATS-activating kinases may act downstream RIPK1 and independent of TAK1. To investigate how LATS kinases were activated by TNF, we screened the kinases related with NF-κB pathway to identify candidates that could induce the activation of LATS by coexpressing of candidate kinases with full-length Flag-tagged LATS1 and then examining the phosphorylation status of LATS1-T1079. MST1 was used as a positive control. By this approach, we identified MEKK2 and MEKK3, two highly homologous MAP3Ks (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase) among 19 MAP3K super family that can efficiently promote LATS1 activation similar as MST1 (Fig. S2A). In contrast, other MAP3K family members exhibited no significant kinase activities on LATS1 (Fig. S2, A and B). Furthermore kinase-dead forms of MEKK2 (MEKK2-KD) and MEKK3 (MEKK3-KD) failed to increase LATS1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). We next tested whether MEKK2/3 could promote MST1/2 kinase activity and indirectly activate LATS kinase activity. The overexpression of MEKK2 and MEKK3 had no kinase activity on MST1/2 shown by MST1 phosphorylation (Fig. S2C) and MOB1-T35 phosphorylation (Fig. S2D), a known MST1/2-specific phosphorylation site. Importantly, MEKK2 and MEKK3 still promoted LATS1 phosphorylation in MM 8KO HEK293A cells in a kinase-activity-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Moreover, MEKK3 promoted YAP-S127 phosphorylation in MM 8KO HEK293A cells, but not in LATS1/2 DKO HEK293A cells (Fig. 2C), thereby further confirming that MST1/2 and MAP4Ks are not required for MEKK2/3 to induce LATS and YAP phosphorylation. In addition, we found that MAP4K4 and MST1 efficiently induced LATS and YAP-S127 phosphorylation in MEKK2/3 DKO HEK293A cells (Fig. 2, D and E and Fig. S2E). Together, these results indicate that MEKK2/3 elicit LATS kinase activity independent of MST1/2 and MAP4Ks. Since MEKK2/3 promote LATS activation, we tested whether MEKK2/3 are able to interact with LATS kinases. As expected, we observed that MEKK2 and MEKK3 interacted with LATS1/2 at both exogenous and endogenous levels (Fig. 2, F and G and Fig. S2F). Furthermore, the interactions between MEKK2/3 and LATS1/2 were not mediated by YAP and TAZ, since MEKK2/3 still bound to LATS1/2 in YAP/TAZ knockdown cells (Fig. S2, G–I). In addition, MEKK2 and MEKK3, but not their kinase-dead forms, phosphorylated LATS1 in the in vitro kinase assay (Fig. S2J). Together, our data suggest that MEKK2/3 act parallel to MST1/2 and MAP4K family kinases to activate LATS1/2 and phosphorylation of YAP in the Hippo pathway. It has been reported that human MEKK3 contains a PPXY motif (aa 178–181) providing a binding site for the WW domain of YAP (41Chen T.H. Chen C.Y. Wen H.C. Chang C.C. Wang H.D. Chuu C.P. Chang C.H. YAP promotes myogenic differentiation via the MEK5-ERK5 pathway.FASEB J. 2017; 31: 2963-2972Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We found that human MEKK2 also contains a PPXY motif (aa 166–169). Since MEKK2/3 also interacted with LATS1/2, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assay to examine the interaction between MEKK2/3 and YAP/TAZ in LATS1/2 DKO HEK293A cells. YAP and TAZ interacted with MEKK2 and MEKK3 at both exogenous and endogenous levels (Fig. 3, A–C and Fig. S3A). Furthermore, the deletion of WW domain in YAP abolished the interaction between MEKK3 and YAP (Fig. S3B). These results indicate that MEKK2/3 interact with YAP/TAZ independent of LATS1/2. Phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ by LATS1/2 leads to YAP/TAZ cytoplasmic translocation and proteasome-mediated protein degradation. Next, we tested whether MEKK2/3 promote YAP degradation through LATS1/2. MEKK3 expression induced the degradation of endogenous YAP and TAZ in a dose-dependent manner in HEK293T cells, which can be blocked by MG132 administration (Fig. S3C). To further explore how MEKK2/3 contribute to YAP degradation, we examined whether MEKK2/3 promote YAP ubiquitination. We found that the expression of MEKK3 markedly enhanced poly-ubiquitination modification of YAP protein (Fig. 3D). Of note, MEKK3-induced YAP poly-ubiquitination was abolished in the absence of LATS1/2 (Fig. 3D). Conversely, YAP poly-ubiquitination was greatly reduced in MEKK2/3 DKO HEK293A cells (Fig. S3, D and E). Furthermore, TNF-induced YAP poly-ubiquitination was abrogated in MEKK2/3 DKO HEK293A cells (Fig. 3E). Previous study demonstrates that LATS-induced YAP degradation is through SCF-β-TRCP-mediated ubiquitination (42Zhao B. Li L. Tumaneng K. Wang C.Y. Guan K.L. A coordinated phosphorylation by Lats and CK1 regulates YAP stability through SCF(beta-TRCP).Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 72-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Notably, MEKK2/3, but not their kinase-dead mutants, greatly enhanced the interaction of YAP with β-TRCP (Fig. S3F). Consistent with the inhibitory function of MEKK2/3 on YAP, the expression of YAP target genes CTGF and CYR61 was decreased in MEKK2 or MEKK3 expressing HEK293A cells, but not their kinase-dead forms (Fig. S3G). Furthermore, the expression levels of CTGF and CYR61 were elevated in MEKK2/3 DKO HEK293A cells (Fig. S3H). In addition, we examined the effect of MEKK2/3 on YAP protein localization by immunofluorescence staining. MEKK2/3, but not their kinase-dead mutants, induced endogenous YAP to translocate into cytoplasm in HEK293A cells (Fig. S3I), indicating that this process requires MEKK2/3's kinase activity. Nuclear/cytosolic fractionation further supported the notion that MEKK3 promoted YAP cytoplasmic translocation (Fig. 3F). Importantly, MEKK3 still elicited YAP cytoplasmic translocation in MM 8KO, but not in LATS1/2 DKO HEK293A cells (Fig. 3, G and H), which is consistent with the observation that MEKK3 promoted YAP-S127 phosphorylation through LATS1/2 (Fig. 2C). In addition, MAP4K4 stimulated YAP cytoplasmic translocation in MEKK2/3 DKO HEK293A cells (Fig. 3I). Thus, these results indicate that MEKK2/3 promote YAP proteasome-mediated degradation and cytoplasm translocation through LATS1/2. We always observed a mobility shift of YAP in SDS-PAGE when YAP was coexpressed with MEKK2 or MEKK3 (Fig. 4A). The mobility shift of YAP was abolished when treated with λPPase (Lambda Protein Phosphatase) (Fig. S4A), indicating that YAP is phosphorylated. MEKK2/3 could activate LATS activity, which may result in the observed phosphorylation of YAP. To rule out this possibility, YAP-5SA, in which all LATS1/2 kinases phosphorylation sites were mutated, was used to coexpress with MEKK2 or MEKK3 in HEK293A cells. However, a remarkable mobility shift of YAP-5SA on SDS-PAGE was still induced in the presence of MEKK2 or MEKK3 (Fig. 4B). In addition, MEKK2/3 purified from LATS1/2 DKO HEK293A cells phosphorylated GST-YAP purified from E. coli in the in vitro kinase assay (Fig. S4B). To identify which amino acids in YAP were phosphorylated by MEKK2/3, we performed mass spectrometric analysis using YAP-Flag proteins purified from LATS1/2 DKO HEK293A cells coexpressing with either MEKK3-WT or MEKK3-KD. Mass spectrometry showed that phosphorylation of YAP at Ser371 and Thr412 was increased by MEKK3-WT but not its kinase-dead mutant (Fig. S4C). Next, we generated YAP mutations targeting Ser371 and Thr412 sites. Mutating the two sites largely eliminated MEKK3-induced YAP phosphorylation in the in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 4C) and the mobility shift of YAP in LATS1/2 DKO HEK293A cells on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4D). To further investigate YAP phosphorylation by MEKK2/3, we generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated Ser371 of YAP (p-YAP-S371). This antibody recognized GST-YAP recombinant protein incubated with MEKK3-Flag but not MEKK3-KD-Flag immunoprecipitated from HEK293A cells in the in vitro kinase assay (Fig. S4D), indicating that MEKK3 indeed phosphorylates YAP at Ser371. Furthermore, we were able to detect exogenous and endogenous YAP phosphorylation at S371 by this antibody in MEKK3 overexpressing HEK293T cells (Fig. 4, E and F). These data indicate that MEKK2/3 directly phosphorylate YAP. Next, we sought to determine the function of YAP phosphorylation by MEKK2/3. Expression of MEKK2 or MEKK3 significantly inhibited both YAP and YAP5SA-mediated TEAD transcriptional activity in WT HEK293A and LATS1/2 DKO cells, respectively (Fig. 4G and Fig. S4E). Notably, the mutations of Ser371 and Thr412 to Ala in YAP largely abolished MEKK3-induced suppression on YAP/TEAD transcriptional activity in a Gal4/TEAD4-luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 4H). Furthermore, S371/T412 phosphomimetic form of YAP was phosphorylated at S127 by LATS1 similar as WT YAP (Fig. S4F), indicating that the phosphorylation of YAP by MEKK2/3 did not impact its phosphorylation by LATS1/2. In addition, we tested whether the phosphorylation of YAP by MEKK2/3 affects the interaction between YAP and TEAD. However, MEKK2 and MEKK3 did not interfere the interaction between YAP and TEAD in LATS1/2 DKO HEK293A cells (Fig. S4G). Together, our results support the functional importance of MEKK2/3 in inhibition of YAP activity through LATS1/2-dependent and -independent manners. MEKK3 is an essential kinase to mediate NF-κB signal transduction. The deletion of MEKK3 disrupts TNF-induced NF-κB activation (31Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Cheng J. Huang J. Deng L. Liao W. Chen Z. Liu Z. Su B. The essential role of MEKK3 in TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation.Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Many stress signals, cytokines, and growth factors induce MEKK2/3 phosphorylation and activation (43Zhang D. Facchinetti V. Wang X. Huang Q. Qin J. Su B. Identification of MEKK2/3 serine phosphorylation site targeted by the Toll-like receptor and stress pathways.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In line with previous observation, TNF stimulation activated MEKK3 kinase activity indicated by the increased Ser526 phosphorylation of MEKK3 (Fig. 1, A and B). Interestingly, signals such as serum starvation and actin depolymerization, which stimulate Hippo activity, also activated MEKK2/3 kinases as shown by the increased MEKK2/3 phosphorylation (Fig. 5, A and B). Consistently, LPA, which inhibits Hippo activity, suppressed MEKK2/3 activity (Fig. 5C). Next, we tested whether MEKK2/3 are involved in Hippo signaling. As expected, TNF-induced LATS phosphorylation was significantly compromised in Mekk2/3 DKO NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 5D). Intriguingly, cell contact, serum starvation, and actin depolymerization-induced LATS and YAP-S127 phosphorylation was also greatly reduced in Mekk2/3 DKO NIH3T3 cells and MEKK2/3 DKO HEK293A cells (Fig. 5, E–G and Fig. S5, A and B). The deletion of Mekk2/3 in NIH3T3 cells resulted in a more profound inhibition on the phosphorylation of LATS and YAP stimulated by various signals. We found that NIH3T3 cells have a higher protein level of MEKK2 and MEKK3, while HEK293A cells express a higher level of MST1/2 and"

However, how they induce this protection is unknown. Here we show that TKIs mediate radioprotection by increasing the repair of DNA double-stranded breaks. DNA repair in IR-treated parotid cells, but not oral cancer cells, occurs more rapidly following pretreatment with imatinib or dasatinib and is accompanied by faster formation of DNA damage-induced foci. Similar results were observed in the parotid glands of mice pretreated with imatinib prior to IR, suggesting that TKIs “prime” cells for DNA repair. Mechanistically, we observed that TKIs increased IR-induced activation of DNA-PK, but not ATM. Pretreatment of parotid cells with the DNA-PK inhibitor NU7441 reversed the increase in DNA repair induced by TKIs. Reporter assays specific for homologous recombination (HR) or nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) verified regulatation of both DNA repair pathways by imatinib. Moreover, TKIs also increased basal and IR-induced expression of genes associated with NHEJ (DNA ligase 4, Artemis, XLF) and HR (Rad50, Rad51 and BRCA1); depletion of DNA ligase 4 or BRCA1 reversed the increase in DNA repair mediated by TKIs. In addition, TKIs increased activation of the ERK survival pathway in parotid cells, and ERK was required for the increased survival of TKI-treated cells. Our studies demonstrate a dual mechanism by which TKIs provide radioprotection of the salivary gland tissues and support exploration of TKIs clinically in head and neck cancer patients undergoing IR therapy.

Our studies demonstrate a dual mechanism by which TKIs provide radioprotection of the salivary gland tissues and support exploration of TKIs clinically in head and neck cancer patients undergoing IR therapy. Most patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer (HNC) in the United States are treated with irradiation (IR) therapy alone or IR in combination with surgery or chemotherapy. While IR is targeted to the tumor, damage to nontumor adjacent tissues such as oral mucosa and the salivary glands also occurs, and in some cases can limit the course of therapy (1Gudkov S.V. Garmash S.A. Shtarkman I.N. Chernikov A.V. Karp O.E. Bruskov V.I. Long-lived protein radicals induced by X-ray irradiation are the source of reactive oxygen species in aqueous medium.Dokl Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 430: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This is despite improvements in radiation delivery such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), which enable more precise delivery of IR to the tumor (2Hawkins P.G. Lee J.Y. Mao Y. Li P.

Permanent damage to the salivary glands occurs in up to 40% of HNC patients and can have a significant impact on quality of life, oral health, and nutrition (3Jensen S.B. Vissink A. Limesand K.H.

The free radical scavenger Amifostine is the only radioprotector currently available for sparing oral tissues, but it is not widely used due to systemic toxicity (4Soref C.M. Hacker T.A. Fahl W.E.

This underscores the need for new radioprotective therapies that can prevent or mitigate IR damage to nontumor tissues without impacting tumor eradication. Tyrosine kinases regulate many biological functions important for survival, including cell proliferation, cell motility, and angiogenesis and thus are important targets in cancer (5Montor W.R.

Conversely, studies from our lab and others demonstrate that dasatinib and imatinib can protect nontumor tissue in mice treated with IR or chemotherapy (13Gonfloni S. Di Tella L. Caldarola S.

Caldarola S. Cannata S.M. Klinger F.G. Di Bartolomeo C. Mattei M. Candi E. De Felici M. Melino G. Cesareni G. Inhibition of the c-Abl-TAp63 pathway protects mouse oocytes from chemotherapy-induced death.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 1179-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Our studies show potent and durable radioprotection of salivary gland tissue and function in vivo when either TKI is delivered before or immediately after IR (16Wie S.M. Wellberg E. Karam S.D. Reyland M.E. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors protect the salivary gland from radiation damage by inhibiting activation of protein kinase C-delta.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2017; 16: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). TKIs mediate radioprotection of the salivary acinar tissues in part through suppression of apoptosis, suggesting that in this context tyrosine kinases are required for cell death (15Wie S.M. Adwan T.S. DeGregori J. Anderson S.M. Reyland M.E. Inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) protects the salivary gland from radiation damage.J. Biol.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors protect the salivary gland from radiation damage by inhibiting activation of protein kinase C-delta.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2017; 16: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Given the paradoxical role of dasatinib and imatinib in suppressing apoptosis in normal tissues, but inducing cell death in some types of cancer, understanding the molecular basis for radioprotection by TKIs is critical. IR produces a wide variety of DNA lesions, with double-stranded breaks (DSBs) being the most abundant (17Santivasi W.L. Xia F. Ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage, response, and repair.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2014; 21: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). DSB repair by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR) can increase cell survival and assure the genomic integrity of replicating cells. Here we have investigated the hypothesis that TKIs provide radioprotection by promoting the repair of IR-induced DNA DSBs. Given the complex nature of the tumor environment, our studies may have important implications both for radioprotection and for tumor therapy. We have previously shown that TKIs suppress apoptosis in vitro and provide robust radioprotection in vivo (15Wie S.M. Adwan T.S. DeGregori J. Anderson S.M. Reyland M.E. Inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) protects the salivary gland from radiation damage.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 10900-10908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 16Wie S.M. Wellberg E. Karam S.D. Reyland M.E. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors protect the salivary gland from radiation damage by inhibiting activation of protein kinase C-delta.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2017; 16: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). DSBs are the most frequent type of DNA lesions induced by IR, and their repair is essential for cell survival (17Santivasi W.L. Xia F. Ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage, response, and repair.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2014; 21: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To address the possibility that dasatinib and imatinib provide radioprotection by increasing DSB repair, we used a DNA comet assay to quantify residual DNA damage after IR, an indirect measurement of DNA repair. We show that pretreatment of ParC5 salivary acinar cells with either dasatinib or imatinib results in more rapid resolution of DNA breaks as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1, A and B). At 6 h post IR, DNA damage is reduced 18% in dasatinib and 46% in imatinib-pretreated cells, compared with cells treated with IR alone (Fig. 1A). At 24 h post IR, DNA damage is reduced 16% in dasatinib and 18% in imatinib-pretreated cells compared with cells treated with IR alone. To verify that IR-induced DNA repair is not enhanced in TKI-treated HNC cells, we repeated the experiment described above using two head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines, FaDu and Detroit 562. Neither dasatinib nor imatinib increased repair of IR-induced DNA damage in either cell line (Fig. 1, C and D), in fact, DNA damage was increased following a 30-min pretreatment with TKIs alone, compared with control ParC5 cells (Fig. 1, C and D, no IR). Furthermore, treatment with either TKI alone for 4 h increased DNA damage up to 25% in Detroit 562 cells (Fig. 1E) consistent with a known effect of TKIs in inducing DNA damage in cancer cells (18Skorski T. BCR/ABL, DNA damage and DNA repair: Implications for new treatment concepts.Leuk. Lymphoma. 2008; 49: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This supports our previous studies that show selectivity of TKIs for radioprotection of salivary gland acinar cells, without enhancing survival of HNSCC in vitro or in vivo (16Wie S.M. Wellberg E. Karam S.D. Reyland M.E. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors protect the salivary gland from radiation damage by inhibiting activation of protein kinase C-delta.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2017; 16: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We next investigated how TKIs impact DNA repair by quantifying IR-induction of γH2AX and 53BP1 foci, which represent sites of active DSB repair (19Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. DNA double-stranded breaks induce histone H2AX phosphorylation on serine 139.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3830) Google Scholar). In dasatinib or imatinib-pretreated cells, both γH2AX and 53BP1 foci increased much more rapidly after delivery of IR compared with control cells (Fig. 2, A–C). At 30 min after IR, γH2AX foci were increased 61% by dasatinib and 51% by imatinib (Fig. 2A), and 53BP1 foci were increased 44% by dasatinib and 30% by imatinib (Fig. 2C). Between 1 and 6 h post IR, γH2AX and 53BP1 foci numbers were similar in untreated and TKI-pretreated cells. However, at 24 h post IR, γH2AX foci were reduced 48% and 34%, and 53BP1 foci were reduced 64% and 44%, in dasatinib and imatinib-treated cells, respectively, compared with IR alone (Fig. 2, A and C). The faster formation of γH2AX and 53BP1 foci at early time points, and increased resolution at 24 h, indicates that repair of DSBs is more rapid and suggests that pretreatment with TKIs may “prime” salivary acinar cells for activation of DNA repair pathways. To determine if TKIs similarly increase IR-induced γH2AX foci in vivo, mice were pretreated with imatinib 1 h prior to delivery of 10 Gy IR and the parotid glands were harvested at various times post IR. IR results in a dramatic increase in γH2AX foci by 1 h, which was resolved by about 50% at 4 h (Fig. 2D). Similar to ParC5 cells in vitro (Fig. 2A), induction of γH2AX foci at 1 h was increased in mice pretreated with imatinib (Fig. 2, D and E), implying more rapid foci formation and accelerated DSB repair. At 24 h post IR γH2AX foci were reduced to nearly the level observed in no IR controls; however, an increase in γH2AX foci was still observed in mice pretreated with imatinib plus IR compared with IR alone (Fig. 2, D and E). Notably, γH2AX foci at this time point appeared more diffused as compared with the punctate foci seen at earlier time points (Fig. 2E). This could represent survival of cells with nonlethal DNA damage in TKI-treated salivary glands. However, whether diffuse γH2AX staining is always associated with DSBs is not clear. For instance, a recent study suggests that diffuse γH2AX staining after IR colocalizes with apoptotic cells and not with DNA damage (20Ding D. Zhang Y. Wang J. Zhang X. Gao Y. Yin L. Li Q. Li J. Chen H. Induction and inhibition of the pan-nuclear gamma-H2AX response in resting human peripheral blood lymphocytes after X-ray irradiation.Cell Death Discov. 2016; 2: 16011Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). DNA DSBs are repaired by HR in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle when a sister chromatid is available and by NHEJ throughout the cell cycle (21Ceccaldi R. Rondinelli B. D'Andrea A.D. Repair pathway Choices and Consequences at the double-strand break.Trends Cell Biol. 2016; 26: 52-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). To explore a role for dasatinib and imatinib in these two DSB repair pathways, we analyzed DNA damage foci immunostained for DNA-PK pS2056, an indicator of NHEJ pathway activation (Fig. 3A) (22Chen B.P. Chan D.W. Kobayashi J. Burma S. Asaithamby A. Morotomi-Yano K. Botvinick E. Qin J. Chen D.J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 14709-14715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), or Rad51, an indicator of HR pathway activation (Fig. 3B) (23Tarsounas M. Davies A.A. West S.C. RAD51 localization and activation following DNA damage.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2004; 359: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Treatment with either TKI resulted in more rapid and more robust formation of DNA-PK pS2056 foci, with peak formation at 30 min with TKIs versus 60 min in control (Fig. 3A). An increase in Rad51 foci was observed as early as 30 min in cells pretreated with TKIs, while Rad51 foci did not increase until 4 h in control cells, consistent with the known lag in HR repair relative to NHEJ (24Mao Z. Bozzella M. Seluanov A. Gorbunova V. Comparison of nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination in human cells.DNA Repair (Amst). 2008; 7: 1765-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Significantly more Rad51 foci were present at 30 min, 1 h, and 4 h in TKI-pretreated cells compared with control cells, with formation of Rad51 foci maximal at 4 h for both groups (Fig. 3B). Our data indicates that treatment with TKIs accelerates DSB repair by both HR and NHEJ and results in less residual DNA damage at 24 h post IR. ParC5 cells were next pretreated with inhibitors of either NHEJ or HR in conjunction with TKIs. Treatment with NU7441, an inhibitor of DNA-PK (25Leahy J.J. Golding B.T. Griffin R.J. Hardcastle I.R. Richardson C. Rigoreau L. Smith G.C. Identification of a highly potent and selective DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) inhibitor (NU7441) by screening of chromenone libraries.Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 6083-6087Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), completely reversed the increase in DNA repair seen in cells treated with dasatinib or imatinib (Fig. 3C); however, neither Mirin, an inhibitor of Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex (26Dupre A. Boyer-Chatenet L. Sattler R.M. Modi A.P. Lee J.H. Nicolette M.L. Kopelovich L. Jasin M. Baer R. Paull T.T. Gautier J. A forward chemical genetic screen reveals an inhibitor of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), nor B02, a Rad51 inhibitor (27Huang F. Motlekar N.A. Burgwin C.M. Napper A.D. Diamond S.L. Mazin A.V. Identification of specific inhibitors of human RAD51 recombinase using high-throughput screening.ACS Chem. Biol. 2011; 6: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), was able to reverse this increase (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, B02 actually further reduced DNA damage in control and TKI-pretreated cells, suggesting that inhibition of HR may activate alternative DNA repair pathways. This suggests that NHEJ may be the predominant pathway for DSB repair in ParC5 cells, consistent with studies that show at least 80% of IR-induced DSBs are repaired by NHEJ (17Santivasi W.L. Xia F. Ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage, response, and repair.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2014; 21: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, an increase in Rad51 foci is also consistent with a role for HR in DSB repair (Fig. 3B). To explore this further, we asked if activation of upstream kinase regulators of NHEJ and HR is altered by TKIs. Dasatinib increased activation of DNA-PK 1.25-fold, while imatinib increased activation nearly 2.10-fold over IR alone as indicated by increased DNA-PK pS2056 at 30 min post IR (Fig. 3, D and E). No increase in ATM pS1952 (human ATM S1981) over control was detected with either TKI (Fig. 3F). To determine if expression of DNA repair genes is altered by imatinib or dasatinib, we analyzed expression of a subset of HR and NHEJ genes by qRT-PCR (Fig. 4, A–D). Basal expression of the HR genes BRCA1, and the NHEJ genes, Artemis, DNA Ligase 4, and XLF, is increased slightly by dasatinib pretreatment (up to 1.2 fold) (black versus dark gray bars, Fig. 4, A and B), while imatinib increased basal expression of all HR and NHEJ genes assayed 1.8- to 2-fold (Fig. 4, C and D). Surprisingly, in some cases IR resulted in a slight decrease in expression of HR and NHEJ specific mRNAs compared with control cells (black versus white bars, Fig. 4, A–D). BRCA1 was the mRNA most highly induced by dasatinib plus IR (1.4-fold over IR-only control, Fig. 4A) and DNA ligase 4 was the most highly induced by imatinib plus IR (>2-fold over IR-only control, Fig. 4D). Based on this data we investigated the contribution of BRCA1 and DNA ligase 4 to radioprotection by depleting each transcript using a siRNA pool. DNA ligase 4 and BRCA1 were depleted 81% and 70% respectively as determined by qRT-PCR (data not shown). Depletion of either DNA ligase 4 (siLig4) or BRCA1 (siBRCA1) in control cells slightly increased DNA repair after IR compared with cells expressing nontargeting siRNA (siNT) (Fig. 4E). However, in imatinib-pretreated cells, depletion of BRCA1 or DNA ligase 4 decreased DNA repair (Fig. 4E) while in dasatinib-pretreated cells only BRCA1 depletion decreased DNA repair. Finally, we utilized NHEJ and HR reporter assays (24Mao Z. Bozzella M. Seluanov A. Gorbunova V. Comparison of nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination in human cells.DNA Repair (Amst). 2008; 7: 1765-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) to ask if either TKI can increase repair at an HR or NHEJ-specific DSB (Fig. 4F). Imatinib increased repair at HR-specific lesions by 73% and repair at NHEJ-specific lesions by 87% (Fig. 4F). Surprisingly, pretreatment with dasatinib did not consistently increase repair at either lesion. This is consistent with data in Figures 3 and 4, A–D that shows a more robust effect of imatinib on DNA repair and expression of repair genes than dasatinib. Our previous studies suggested that TKIs can enhance tissue regeneration in vivo following IR (16Wie S.M. Wellberg E. Karam S.D. Reyland M.E. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors protect the salivary gland from radiation damage by inhibiting activation of protein kinase C-delta.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2017; 16: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To address a potential prosurvival role for TKIs, ParC5 cells were pretreated with dasatinib or imatinib prior to IR delivery and activation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) was assayed. TKI pretreatment increased basal ERK activation in ParC5 cells 3- and 6-fold, respectively, and further activated ERK at all time points after IR (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, activated ERK was not increased by IR in FaDu or Detroit 562 HNSCC cells (Fig. 5C). To determine if ERK activation by TKIs increases survival of ParC5 cells after IR, we assayed clonogenic survival of cells treated with imatinib plus the MEK/ERK inhibitor, PD98059 (Fig. 5D). Imatinib dramatically increased the surviving fraction in response to IR; however, this appears to be largely independent of ERK as treatment with PD98059 did not significantly alter the surviving fraction at any IR dose (Fig. 5D). This suggests that ERK activation may be important for cell survival during plating and/or for colony proliferation. To address this, we quantified colony number (Fig. 5E) and size (Fig. 5G) in cells pretreated with either TKI, with or without PD98059 or IR treatment. Both TKIs increased total colony formation >2-fold in the absence of IR, consistent with increased survival during plating (Fig. 5E). After treatment with IR, colony formation in cells treated with dasatinib was 4-fold higher, while in cells treated with imatinib colony formation was increased 7-fold (Fig. 5E), suggesting an additional contribution of TKIs to IR-specific survival. Under all conditions colony formation was strictly dependent on ERK, suggesting that a major effect of ERK activation by TKIs is to increase plating efficiency. Likewise, colony size was increased dramatically by imatinib, but not dasatinib (Fig. 5G), and this was inhibited by PD98059. Cells in suspension can resist apoptosis by upregulation of survival pathways such as ERK (28Collins N.L. Reginato M.J. Paulus J.K. Sgroi D.C. Labaer J. Brugge J.S. G1/S cell cycle arrest provides anoikis resistance through Erk-mediated Bim suppression.Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 5282-5291Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Given the dramatic effect of PD98059 on survival during plating, we asked if TKIs regulate apoptosis and if this is dependent on ERK activation. As shown in Figure 5H, both imatinib and dasatinib protect IR-treated cells from apoptosis, and this protection is dependent in part on ERK. Taken together, our data suggests that ERK activation by TKIs is important for cell survival during plating and that this may be mediated by TKI- and ERK-dependent suppression of apoptosis. Thus, in addition to increased DNA repair, ERK-dependent resistance to apoptosis likely contributes to radioprotection by TKIs. Acutely radiosensitive tissues, including gastrointestinal mucosa and tissues in the oral cavity, are often unintended targets in patients undergoing IR therapy for cancer. While TKIs are widely used for cancer therapy, studies from our lab and others also show that some TKIs can protect against IR and chemotherapy-induced tissue damage (13Gonfloni S. Di Tella L.

Although regioselectivity of transfructosylation is divergent in GH68 enzymes, there is insufficient information available on the structural factor(s) involved in the selectivity. Here, we found two GH68 enzymes, β-fructofuranosidase (FFZm) and levansucrase (LSZm), encoded tandemly in the genome of Zymomonas mobilis, displayed different selectivity: FFZm catalyzed the β-(2→1)-transfructosylation (1-TF), whereas LSZm did both of 1-TF and β-(2→6)-transfructosylation (6-TF). We identified His79FFZm and Ala343FFZm and their corresponding Asn84LSZm and Ser345LSZm respectively as the structural factors for those regioselectivities. LSZm with the respective substitution of FFZm-type His and Ala for its Asn84LSZm and Ser345LSZm (N84H/S345A-LSZm) lost 6-TF and enhanced 1-TF. Conversely, the LSZm-type replacement of His79FFZm and Ala343FFZm in FFZm (H79N/A343S-FFZm) almost lost 1-TF and acquired 6-TF. H79N/A343S-FFZm exhibited the selectivity like LSZm but did not produce the β-(2→6)-fructoside-linked levan and/or long levanooligosaccharides that LSZm did. We assumed Phe189LSZm to be a responsible residue for the elongation of levan chain in LSZm and mutated the corresponding Leu187FFZm in FFZm to Phe. An H79N/L187F/A343S-FFZm produced a higher quantity of long levanooligosaccharides than H79N/A343S-FFZm (or H79N-FFZm), although without levan formation, suggesting that LSZm has another structural factor for levan production. We also found that FFZm generated a sucrose analog, β-D-fructofuranosyl α-D-mannopyranoside, by β-fructosyltransfer to d-mannose and regarded His79FFZm and Ala343FFZm as key residues for this acceptor specificity.

In summary, this study provides insight into the structural factors of regioselectivity and acceptor specificity in transfructosylation of GH68 enzymes. The so-called fructooligosaccharides (FOSs) are structurally divided into two types: the reducing FOSs and the nonreducing FOSs. The former is composed of only fructose units with reducing power, whereas the latter has the former conformation blocked by a glucose unit at its reducing fructosyl residue, thereby meaning “glucosides” (or “fructoside” for disaccharide). Natural nonreducing FOSs are mainly categorized into inulooligosaccharide (INO; whose long saccharide is an inulin with less than around sixty β-(2→1)-linked fructosyl units) and levanooligosaccharide (LVO; whose polysaccharide is a levan linked by β-(2→6)-fructosyl units). Also, natural reducing FOSs are present by cleaving a terminal Glc-Fru unit (sucrose unit) of INO or LVO with α-glucosidase and acidic condition. These natural FOSs are originally regarded to be responsible for energy storage in plants. Other possible functions, including their contribution to the tolerance against drought and freezing, are also proposed in plants and microbes (1Versluys M. Kirtel O. Öner E.T. Van den Ende W. The fructan syndrome: Evolutionary aspects and common themes among plants and microbes.Plant Cell Environ. 2018; 41: 16-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, their associated health benefits also receive considerable attention, such as the selective stimulation of the growth and/or the activity of beneficial intestinal bacteria, contributing to the increase of the absorption of several minerals as well as the lowering of the cholesterol levels (2Belorkar S.A. Gupta A.K. Oligosaccharides: A boon from nature's desk.AMB Express. 2016; 682Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 3Tochio T. Kadota Y. Tanaka T.

Figure 1 depicts the structures of INO (e.g., 1-kestose and nystose), LVO (e.g., 6-kestose), levan, and neokestose [e.g., β-fructosyl-(2→6)-glucosyl fructoside]. These nonreducing FOSs and levan are produced from sucrose with the aid of fructosyl-transferring enzymes. Syntheses of INOs and inulin in plants are initiated by sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase, resulting in 1-kestose. Subsequently, 1-kestose is further elongated by the action of fructan:fructan 1-fructosyltransferase. In microorganisms, the inulosucrase is responsible for the inulin synthesis. β-Fructofuranosidase (FF) is often used for the in vitro synthesis of INO, including commercially available INO, such as the 1-kestose and the nystose, which are produced by fungal FF (3Tochio T.

On the other hand, LVO and levan are well known to be produced by microbial levansucrase (LS). Plants, including timothy (Phleum pratense), orchard grass (Dactylis glomerate), and big bluegrass (Poa secunda), accumulate simple linear levan, of which timothy is identified to be synthesized with sucrose:fructan 6-fructosyltransferase (5Cairns A.J.

Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B.

Among them, plant-derived enzymes and fungal FF generally belong to GH32, whereas the inulosucrase, LS, and bacterial FF are classified as GH68. GH32, and 68 proteins have a 5-bladed β-propeller fold as a catalytic domain, grouped into clan GH-J. The enzymes in this clan are known to show a catalytic double displacement mechanism with two carboxy groups, a catalytic nucleophile, and a general acid/base, for hydrolysis and/or transfructosylation. During the synthesis of inulin and levan, the transfructosylation occurs successively. Bacterial LS, especially LS from Gram-positive Bacillus spp. (LSBspp), is one of the most characterized GH68 enzymes (14Porras-Domínguez J.R. Ávila-Fernández Á. Miranda-Molina A.

The molecular weight of the levan produced by these LSBspps, reaching 3 × 106, can be controlled by the reaction conditions and the mutagenesis of the enzyme. The protein engineering works and other results are well reviewed by Oritiz-Soto et al. (17Ortiz-Soto M.E. Porras-Domínguez J.R. Seibel J. López-Munguía A.

There are different types of LSs derived from Gram-negative bacteria, a Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus LS (LSGd) and an Erwinia amylovora LS (LSEa), which synthesize a low amount of levan with the low molecular weight (18Hernandez L.

Gram-negative Zymomonas mobilis is known to grow on sucrose, glucose, and fructose as a carbon source. Therefore, it is possible that the enzymes associated with sucrose degradation of this bacterium have undergone its own molecular evolution under the limitation of having to use sucrose as a carbon source. Z. mobilis has two GH68 enzyme genes with ZZ6_0874 and ZZ6_0875 locus tags, which are positioned side by side in the chromosome, as if one of them was formed by a tandem gene duplication. Gene duplication has been of long-standing interest in the evolution as once a gene has duplicated, a novel function may be acquired by one of the copies (21Loehlin D.W. Carroll S.B. Expression of tandem gene duplicates is often greater than twofold.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2016; 113: 5988-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).

In this study, we found a distinction in regioselectivity of the FFZm- and LSZm-catalyzed transfructosylation as well as identified the structural factors responsible for the regioselectivity by mutation works. Until now, no studies have been performed to our knowledge on the regulation of the regioselectivity of GH68 enzymes. Our mutation works also enabled to learn one of important residues to elongate LVO chain. The FFZm was found to generate β-d-fructofuranosyl α-d-mannopyranoside (Fru-Man; a sucrose analog) with a good yield, which was firstly produced by Bacillus subtilis LS (LSBc) (28Seibel J. Moraru R.

Wild-type LSZm and FFZm had the specific activities of 247 and 1620 U mg−1, respectively (Table 1). The pH optimum for both enzymes was at pH 5.0, and the pH stability was between pH 4.2 and 5.5 after treatment at 4 °C for 24 h, as well as the thermal stability was up to 45 °C after a 15 min incubation. Although the initial velocity can be measured at 45 °C, the following transfructosylation experiments were carried out at 35 °C, where the activities were maintained even after prolonged reaction.Table 1Properties of FFZm, LSZm, and their variantsEnzymeSpecific activity (U mg−1)Optimum pHpH-stabilityaThermal stability (°C)bFFZm Wild type16205.04.2‒6.0<45 H79N-FFZm5025.04.1‒6.0<40 A343S-FFZm3805.04.1‒6.0<45 H79N/A343S-FFZm2745.04.1‒6.0<45 H79N/L187F/A343S-FFZm3505.04.1‒6.0<40LSZm Wild type2475.04.1‒5.5<45 N84H-LSZm4805.53.7‒5.5<60 S345A-LSZm8005.03.7‒5.0<60 N84H/S345A-LSZm4405.53.7‒5.5<60apH stability or bthermal stability shows the range to maintain the residual activity of more than 90% a after treating with various pH at 4 °C for 24 h or b after incubating at various temperatures for 15 min, respectively.

The initial products were glucose, fructose, 1-kestose, and 6-kestose, at which the hydrolysis generates glucose and fructose from sucrose and water as well as the transfructosylation forms trisaccharide (1-kestose or 6-kestose) and glucose from two sucrose molecules. Therefore, the initial reactions of both enzymes follow the scheme of Figure 2C, similarly to many glycosylases (28Seibel J. Moraru R. Götze S. Buchholz K. Na'amnieh S. Pawlowski A. Hecht H.J. Synthesis of sucrose analogues and the mechanism of action of Bacillus subtilis fructosyltransferase (levansucrase).Carbohydr. Res. 2006; 341: 2335-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Transfructosylation products were different in LSZm and FFZm, where 6-kestose and 1-kestose were synthesized by the former (Fig. 2A), while 1-kestose with a trace amount of 6-kestose was synthesized by the latter (Fig. 2B). 1-Kestose (or 6-kestose) is produced from two-substrate reaction using two sucrose molecules as noted above, at which a fructosyl residue of donor sucrose is transferred to an acceptor sucrose to form the β-(2→1)-fructoside linkage [or β-(2→6)-fructoside linkage]. The formation velocities of the transfructosylation products, 6-kestose (v6-kestose [E]0−1; abbreviated as v6-Kes) and 1-kestose (v1-kestose [E]0−1; v1-Kes), increased with an increase of [sucrose] (Fig. 2, A and B). In the range of [sucrose] up to 300 mM, the formation velocities of glucose (vglucose [E]0−1; vGlc) and fructose (vfructose [E]0−1; vFru) increased with showing almost equal amounts (Fig. 2, A and B), meaning that the main reaction is a hydrolysis. Moreover, as a [sucrose] increased, vGlc and vFru decreased (especially vFru), meaning that the hydrolysis reduces and the transfructosylation increases. According to the scheme that is followed by the LSZm and the FFZm (Fig. 2C), the velocity of hydrolysis is reflected by vFru, and that of transfructosylation is indicated by v6-Kes and/or v1-Kes. The vGlc represents a sucrose degradation velocity, meaning the whole reaction velocities, i.e., the sum of hydrolysis and transfructosylation. The decrease in vFru can be ascribed to the increase in transfructosylation at the high [sucrose]. On the other hand, the diminution in vGlc indicates the substrate inhibition of enzyme reaction. There are two possibilities that can explain this inhibitory phenomenon. First, the accumulation of an E-F·F-G complex is assumed (Fig. 2C) (29Brumer H. Sims P.F. Sinnott M.L. Lignocellulose degradation by Phanerochaete chrysosporium: Purification and characterization of the main α-galactosidase.Biochem.

Kinetic properties and substrate inhibition of α-galactosidase from Aspergillus niger.Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2016; 80: 1747-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The concentration of the E-F·F-G complex ([E-F·F-G]) increases with increasing [sucrose], eventually exceeding the limit of the ability to catalyze the fructosidic linkage formation, so that the accumulation of the E-F·F-G is expected to occur. Since the [E·F-G], [E-F], and [E-F·F-G] are in steady state, an increase in the [E-F·F-G] causes a decrease in the vGlc. Secondly, a nonproductive binding that, for instance, the excess sucrose occupies the +1 and +2 subsites of the catalytic site, prevents the productive binding of the sucrose at −1 and +1 subsites (31Dolinsky T.J. Nielsen J.E. McCammon J.A. Baker N.A. PDB2PQR: An automated pipeline for the setup of Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatics calculations.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W665-W667Crossref PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar). The occurrence of the nonproductive binding increases at a higher [sucrose]. We cannot identify the correct mechanism among the two possibilities [or more correct further candidate(s) might exist, if the above two possibilities are not accurate]. The proportion of the transfructosylation velocity in all reaction velocities, which can be estimated from the equation of (v1-kestose + v6-kestoe)/vglucose, was 0.52 in LSZm and 0.34 in FFZm using 1 M sucrose as substrate (Table 2). Yanase et al. (24Yanase H. Iwata M. Kita K. Kato N. Tonomura K. Purification, crystallization, and characterization of the extracellular invertase from Zymomonas mobilis.J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1995; 79: 367-369Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) reported that the FFZm, purified from the periplasmic fraction of Z. mobilis, exhibited no transfructosylation activity, in regard of which the detailed experimental conditions were missing. A certain reaction condition might be inadequate, suggesting that one factor is a less enough [sucrose].Table 2Reaction velocities of FFZm, LSZm, and their variants against 1 M sucroseEnzymevglucose [E]0−1 (s−1)vfructose [E]0−1 (s−1)v1-kestose [E]0−1 (s−1)v6-kestose [E]0−1 (s−1)Transfructosylation ratioaTransfructosylation ratio was calculated from the equation of (v1-kestose + v6-kestose) ∕ vglucose, indicative of the proportion of transfructosylation to whole reactions: e.g., a transfructosylation ratio of 0.69 means 69% of transfructosylation and 31% of hydrolysis at 1M sucrose.v6-kestose/(v1-kestose + v6-kestose) (%)FFZm Wild type2980 ± 3601960 ± 3101150 ± 16045 ± 40.343.8 H79N-FFZm1500 ± 1301200 ± 4265 ± 848 ± 90.2042 A343S-FFZm200 ± 9160 ± 612 ± 14.8 ± 0.30.2029 H79 N/A343S-FFZm600 ± 29505 ± 521.7 ± 0.651 ± 50.1697 H79N/L187F/A343S-FFZm920 ± 23600 ± 3512 ±0.9190 ± 150.3594LSZm Wild type1820 ± 216870± 193216 ± 13370 ± 840.5263 N84H-LSZm790 ± 59330 ± 23420 ± 693.0 ± 0.10.587 S345A-LSZm1400 ± 66480 ± 63360 ± 852 ± 50.6613 N84H/S345A-LSZm1600 ± 120500 ± 701100 ± 701.5 ± 0.20.690.14a Transfructosylation ratio was calculated from the equation of (v1-kestose + v6-kestose) ∕ vglucose, indicative of the proportion of transfructosylation to whole reactions: e.g., a transfructosylation ratio of 0.69 means 69% of transfructosylation and 31% of hydrolysis at 1M sucrose. Open table in a new tab The LSZm- and FFZm-generating transfructosylation products from 1 M sucrose were analyzed at 1 h (Fig. 3). The wild-type LSZm synthesized 6-kestose, 1-kestose, and neokestose (Fig. 3A). Neokestose, produced by β-(2→6)-transfructosylation (6-TF) of a fructose unit to the glucosyl residue of sucrose, was not detected during the initial reaction, implying a slower formation than that of the 6-kestose and 1-kestose. At 24 h, LSZm formed several oligosaccharides (6-kestose, neokestose, and nystose) as well as some possible LVOs with high degree of polymerizations (DPs) (Fig. 3B). The long LVOs should have DPs at least 25 (inset of Fig. 3B), although their exact DPs could not be estimated due to unavailable standards. They might be the intermediates of low-molecular weight levan after the elongation with successive 6-TF. On the other hand, the FFZm generated a sole trisaccharide of 1-kestose at 1 h (Fig. 3C). At 24 h, further trisaccharides of the 6-kestose, neokestose, and nystose were observed along with a small amount of the products above DP4 (Fig. 3D). In cases of both initial and late reaction stages, FFZm and LSZm show different regioselectivity in the transfructosylation process (Figs. 2 and 3), at which the former mainly catalyzes β-(2→1)-transfructosylation (1-TF), whereas the latter does both of 1-TF and 6-TF. As mentioned above, the regioselectivity of transfructosylation diverges at GH68 FFZm and LSZm, despite that their amino-acid sequences share the significantly high 61.5% identity and 72.0% similarity with only 5.1% gaps, leading us to unravel the structural factor(s) in connection with the regulation of regioselectivity distinction. However, the three-dimensional structures (3Ds) of these enzymes remain unresolved currently, and it is hard to identify the amino acid residues that are key to the differences in specificity. To visualize the 3Ds of amino acid residues at the active-site pocket of FFZm and LSZm, both enzymes were modeled (Fig. 4) using the 3D of LSEa (32Wuerges J. Caputi L. Cianci M. Boivin S. Meijers R. Benini S. The crystal structure of Erwinia amylovora levansucrase provides a snapshot of the products of sucrose hydrolysis trapped into the active site.J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 191: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as it had the most similarity to the amino-acid sequence of the 3D-known GH68 proteins. Pairwise alignments for the construction of model structures were created with Needleman–Wunsch algorithm using BLOSUM62 as the score matrix, and FFZm and LSZm showed 45.3% and 51.1% sequence identity with the template sequence, respectively. Comparative modeling was done in automodel mode of MODELLER. GA341 and zDOPE in the respective models were 1.0 and −0.88 (FFZm) and 1.0 and −0.82 (LSZm), indicating a reliable model. Besides, the 1-kestose and 6-kestose docked to FFZm and LSZm using AutoDock Vina (33Trott O. Olson A.J.

The residues forming −1 and +1 subsites were well conserved, except for His79FFZm and Ala343FFZm (Fig. 4A), corresponding to Asn84LSZm and Ser345LSZm, respectively (Fig. 4B).

It binds to and signals through several integrins, including αvβ3 and α5β1, which bind to the trimeric interface of CD40L. We previously showed that several integrin ligands can bind to the allosteric site (site 2), which is distinct from the classical ligand-binding site (site 1), raising the question of if CD40L activates integrins. In our explorations of this question, we determined that integrin α4β1, which is prevalently expressed on the same CD4+ T cells as CD40L, is another receptor for CD40L. Soluble (s)CD40L activated soluble integrins αvβ3, α5β1, and α4β1 in cell-free conditions, indicating that this activation does not require inside-out signaling. Moreover, sCD40L activated cell-surface integrins in CHO cells that do not express CD40. To learn more about the mechanism of binding, we determined that sCD40L bound to a cyclic peptide from site 2. Docking simulations predicted that the residues of CD40L that bind to site 2 are located outside of the CD40L trimer interface, at a site where four HIGM1 (hyper-IgM syndrome type 1) mutations are clustered. We tested the effect of these mutations, finding that the K143T and G144E mutants were the most defective in integrin activation, providing support that this region interacts with site 2. We propose that allosteric integrin activation by CD40L also plays a role in CD40L signaling, and defective site 2 binding may be related to the impaired CD40L signaling functions of these HIGM1 mutants.

CD40L is a type II protein ligand member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily expressed by activated T cells. CD40L is a costimulatory molecule critical in a variety of T cell–antigen presenting cell (APC) interactions, including activating APCs to provide help to cytotoxic T cells (1Schoenberger S.P. Toes R.E. van der Voort E.I. Offringa R. Melief C.J. T-cell help for cytotoxic T lymphocytes is mediated by CD40-CD40L interactions.Nature. 1998; 393: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). It also provides help to B cell to promote class switching (2Korthauer U. Graf D. Mages H.W. Briere F. Padayachee M. Malcolm S. Ugazio A.G. Notarangelo L.D. Levinsky R.J. Kroczek R.A.

The CD40/CD154 receptor/ligand dyad.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 4-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its transmembrane form, CD40L is also released as a soluble ligand (sCD40L) by proteolytic cleavage, allowing it to interact at more distant sites. CD40L appears to modulate other cell types as well (4Chatzigeorgiou A. Lyberi M. Chatzilymperis G. Nezos A. Kamper E. CD40/CD40L signaling and its implication in health and disease.Biofactors. 2009; 35: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). CD40L can initiate inflammatory and procoagulatory responses in vascular endothelial cells (5Cha J.K. Jeong M.H. Bae H.R. Han J.Y. Jeong S.J. Jin H.J. Lim Y.J. Kim S.H. Kim J.W.

Findings such as these have led to the belief that CD40–CD40L interactions play a more general role in immune regulation. Given its diverse functions, it is not surprising that CD40L is critical in a variety of chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), diabetes, chronic kidney disease (8Crow M.K.

CD40L functions through its interactions with cell surface proteins CD40, and α5β1 and αIIbβ3 integrins. CD40 belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) family and was first identified and functionally characterized on B lymphocytes (10Grewal I.S. Flavell R.A. CD40 and CD154 in cell-mediated immunity.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 111-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). CD40–CD40L interactions play a more general role in immune regulation and stabilize arterial thrombi through binding to integrin αIIbβ3 (11Andre P. Prasad K.S. Denis C.V. He M. Papalia J.M. Hynes R.O. Phillips D.R. Wagner D.D. CD40L stabilizes arterial thrombi by a beta3 integrin--dependent mechanism.Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). αIIbβ3 recognizes the KGD motif at the N terminus of CD40L (residues 115–117 of CD40L). It has also been reported that CD40L binds to integrin α5β1 and transduces signals through this integrin in a CD40 and αIIbβ3-independent manner. Finally, data suggests that CD40 and integrin α5β1 can bind to CD40L simultaneously (12El Fakhry Y. Alturaihi H. Yacoub D. Liu L. Guo W. Leveille C. Jung D. Khzam L.B. Merhi Y. Wilkins J.A. Li H. Mourad W. Functional interaction of CD154 protein with alpha5beta1 integrin is totally independent from its binding to alphaIIbbeta3 integrin and CD40 molecules.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 18055-18066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We recently identified vascular integrin αvβ3 as a new receptor for CD40L (13Takada Y.K. Yu J. Shimoda M. Takada Y. Integrin binding to the trimeric interface of CD40L plays a critical role in CD40/CD40L signaling.J. Immunol. 2019; 203: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We localized the α5β1 and αvβ3 binding to the trimeric interface of CD40L. CD40L mutants defective in integrin binding in the predicted integrin-binding site were defective in CD40L/CD40 signaling and acted as antagonists of CD40L/CD40 signaling (13Takada Y.K. Yu J. Shimoda M. Takada Y. Integrin binding to the trimeric interface of CD40L plays a critical role in CD40/CD40L signaling.J. Immunol. 2019; 203: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated that CD40L binding to αvβ3 activates αvβ3 in an allosteric manner. Of relevance to our discovery is the finding that eight X-Linked Hyper IgM Syndrome (HIGM1)-causative variants have alterations in the CD40L integrin binding, and they are defective in integrin binding and signaling, suggesting that the loss of integrin binding is related to the defect in CD40L signaling in HIGM1. Also, our previous studies found that several proinflammatory integrin ligands (e.g., CX3CL1, CXCL12, and secreted phospholipase A2 type IIA (sPLA-IIA)) activated integrins by binding to a second ligand-binding site (site 2) in an allosteric manner in addition to binding to a primary site (site 1) (14Fujita M.

The recent discovery on the binding of 25-hydroxycholesterol to integrin site 2 upregulates inflammatory cytokines, TNF, and IL-6, production (17Pokharel S.M. Shil N.K. Gc J.B. Colburn Z.T. Tsai S.Y.

Commun. 2019; 10: 1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) indicates that site-2-mediated integrin activation is involved in proinflammatory signaling. Herein, we now present data that integrin α4β1 is a new receptor for CD40L. Notably, we showed that CD40L is an allosteric activator of integrins αvβ3, α5β1, and α4β1. Specifically, we demonstrate that CD40L can bind to an allosteric ligand-binding site (Site 2) (14Fujita M. Takada Y.K. Takada Y.

J. 2018; 475: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), which is distinct from αvβ3’s classical ligand-binding site (site 1). Also, four HIGM1 mutants are clustered in the site-2-binding site of CD40L, indicating that site-2-binding is potentially involved in CD40L/CD40 signaling. We propose that CD40L acts as a ligand and an allosteric activator of several integrins and mediates proinflammatory signaling independent of CD40. We further propose that this may be a common mechanism for a group of proinflammatory proteins and that CD40L-induced integrin activation is required for CD40L signaling. Previous studies showed that several proinflammatory integrin ligands activated integrins in an allosteric manner (see Introductions). We hypothesized that another proinflammatory cytokine CD40L activates integrins. Previous studies showed that soluble integrin αvβ3 bound to many ligands including the fibrinogen γ-chain C-terminal domain with truncation at the C terminus (γC399tr) (See Introduction). γC399tr specifically binds to site 1 of αvβ3, but not to site 2 (14Fujita M. Takada Y.K. Takada Y. The chemokine fractalkine can activate integrins without CX3CR1 through direct binding to a ligand-binding site distinct from the classical RGD-binding site.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e96372Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We studied if sCD40L enhances the binding of soluble αvβ3 to γC399tr. γC399tr was immobilized and incubated with soluble αvβ3 in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+ to keep αvβ3 inactive (Fig. 1A). sCD40L enhanced binding of soluble αvβ3 to immobilized γC399tr in a dose-dependent manner. Activation is defined by the increase in binding of soluble integrin αvβ3 to immobilized ligand (γC399tr) by soluble activators (sCD40L). These findings suggest that CD40L activates integrin αvβ3 in an allosteric manner. We next studied if sCD40L activates integrin αvβ3 on the cell surface using CHO cells (CD40-negative) that express recombinant αvβ3 (β3-CHO cells). β3-CHO cells were incubated with sCD40L and FITC-labeled γC399tr in the assays medium with 1 mM Ca2+ to keep αvβ3 inactive and bound FITC-labeled γC399tr was measured in flow cytometry. sCD40L markedly enhanced the binding of γC399tr, indicating that sCD40L activated αvβ3 on the cell surface (Fig. 1B). The activation of αvβ3 by sCD40L was dose-dependent (up to 50 μg/ml) and can be detected at 6 μg/ml. The binding of FITC-labeled γC399tr shown by mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) correlated well with the sCD40L concentrations (Fig. 1D). Although high concentrations of sCD40L were required to activate soluble integrins, it is likely that integrin activation by sCD40L is biologically relevant, since CD40L is a membrane-bound protein and is highly concentrated on the cell surface. We previously showed that several integrin ligands (e.g., CX3CL1, CXCL12, and sPLA2-IIA) bound to an allosteric site (site 2) and activated several integrins (14Fujita M. Takada Y.K. Takada Y.

The simulation predicts that monomeric CD40L binds to site 2 well (docking energy –20.5 kcal/mol) (Fig. 1D). We previously reported that the peptide from site 2 of β3 (QPNDGQSHVGSDNHYSASTTM, residues 267–287 of β3, Cys-273 is changed to S, fused to GST) directly bound to CX3CL1, sPLA2-IIA, and CXCL12 and the peptide suppressed integrin activation by these activators, suggesting that they directly bind to site 2 and mediate integrin activation (14Fujita M.

J. 2018; 475: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To prove if CD40L binds to site 2, we tested if CD40L binds to peptides derived from site 2. Linear site 2 peptides did not show good binding to CD40L (not shown). We thus designed disulfide-linked cyclic 28-mer peptides by introducing two Cys residues at both ends to enhance affinity and stability of the peptides. To predict the positions of the two Cys residues that do not affect the peptide conformation of the peptides we used the Disulfide by Design-2 (DbD2) software (18Craig D.B. Dombkowski A.A. Disulfide by Design 2.0: A web-based tool for disulfide engineering in proteins.BMC Bioinformatics. 2013; 14: 346Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We found that cyclic site 2 peptide from β3 (C260-RLAGIVQPNDGQSHVGSDNHYSASTTMC288) and the corresponding β1 peptide bound to sCD40L, suggesting that sCD40L binds to site 2 (Fig. 2A). The position of cyclic site 2 peptide is shown in Figure 2B. These findings suggest that sCD40L activates integrins by binding to site 2. The docking simulation predicts that four HIGM1 mutations (S128R/E129G, K143T, G144E, and L155P) are clustered in the predicted site-2-binding interface of CD40L (Fig. 2B). Amino acid residues involved in the predicted CD40L-αvβ3 (closed form) interaction are shown in Table 1. We studied if these HIGM1 mutations affect CD40L-induced αvβ3 activation. Notably, the K143T and G144E mutants were defective in activating soluble αvβ3 (Fig. 2C) and were defective in activating cell surface αvβ3 (Fig. 2D). These finding are consistent with the docking model that these mutations (K143T and G144E) are located in the predicted site-2-binding site of CD40L (Fig. 2B).Table 1Amino acid residues involved in the predicted CD40L-αvβ3 (closed form) interactionCD40LαVβ3Glu129, Ala130, Ser131, Lys133, Thr134, Thr135, Glu142, Lys143, Gly144, Tyr145, Tyr146, Leu155, Lys159, Phe177, Cys178, Ser179, Asn180, Arg181, Ala183, Ser184, Pro217, Cys218, Gln220, Pro244, Ser245, Gln246, Val247, Ser248, His249, Gly250, Thr251,Pro14, Glu15, Asn44, Thr45, Thr46, Gln47, Pro48, Gly49, Ile50, Val51, Glu52, Gln68, Gly76, Asn77, Arg78, Asp79, Ala81, Lys82, Asp83, Asp84, Pro85, Glu87, Phe88, Lys89, Ser90, His91, Arg122,Met165, Ser168, Glu171, Glu174, Asn175, Pro186, Asp278, His280, Tyr281, Ser282, Ala283, Ser284, Thr285, Thr286The amino acid residues in CD40L that are mutated in HIGM1 are in bold.The amino acid residues in β3 that are involved in site 2 peptide are underlined.

Previous studies identified amino acid residues in the trimeric interface that are involved in binding to the classical ligand-binding site (site 1) of activated integrins (13Takada Y.K. Yu J.

Consistently, the two CD40L mutations Y170E and G252E in the trimeric interface are defective in binding to site 1 (13Takada Y.K. Yu J. Shimoda M. Takada Y.

This finding is consistent with the model that site-1-binding and site-2-binding sites are distinct. Previous studies showed that integrin α5β1 binds to CD40L and induces signals independent of CD40 (12El Fakhry Y. Alturaihi H. Yacoub D. Liu L. Guo W. Leveille C. Jung D. Khzam L.B. Merhi Y.

We previously identified the binding site for α5β1 in the trimeric interface of CD40L, indicating that α5β1 and αvβ3-binding sites overlap in the trimeric interface of CD40L (13Takada Y.K. Yu J. Shimoda M. Takada Y. Integrin binding to the trimeric interface of CD40L plays a critical role in CD40/CD40L signaling.J. Immunol. 2019; 203: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that CD40L activates α5β1 as well in an allosteric manner. We confirmed that biotinylated soluble α5β1 binds to the fibronectin fragment (FN8-11), a specific ligand to α5β1, in ELISA-type activation assays in the presence of 1 mM Mn+2 (Fig. 3A). FN8-11 binds to site 1, but does not bind to site 2 (14Fujita M. Takada Y.K. Takada Y. The chemokine fractalkine can activate integrins without CX3CR1 through direct binding to a ligand-binding site distinct from the classical RGD-binding site.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e96372Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We studied if sCD40L activates soluble α5β1. Activation is defined by the increase in integrin binding to immobilized FN8-11 by soluble sCD40L. FN8-11 was immobilized and incubated with biotinylated soluble α5β1 in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+. sCD40L enhanced the binding of soluble α5β1 to immobilized FN8-11 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). These findings indicate that sCD40L activates soluble integrin α5β1 in cell-free conditions. We showed that sCD40L activated cell-surface α5β1 in CHO cells (α5β1+, CD40-) using FITC-labeled FN8-11 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). The levels of α5β1 activation by sCD40L in MFI and sCD40L concentrations correlated well (Fig. 3, C and D). We studied if four HIGM1 mutants can activate cell-surface α5β1 in CHO cells. They were defective in activating α5β1 and the K143T was the most defective (Fig. 3E). These findings suggest that sCD40L binds to site 2 of α5β1 in a manner similar to that of αvβ3 and activates α5β1. CD40L is primarily expressed in activated CD4+ T cells, but αvβ3 and α5β1 are not major integrins in T cells. sCD40L binds to site 1 of activated αvβ3 and α5β1 (13Takada Y.K. Yu J. Shimoda M. Takada Y. Integrin binding to the trimeric interface of CD40L plays a critical role in CD40/CD40L signaling.J. Immunol. 2019; 203: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is unclear if integrin α4β1, which is expressed primarily in immune-competent cells, interacts with CD40L. We used biotinylated soluble α4β1 to study if α4β1 binds to CD40L. We found that soluble α4β1 activated by 1 mM Mn2+ bound to immobilized WT sCD40L in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A), indicating that CD40L is a ligand for α4β1 that binds to site 1. We then studied if sCD40L activates α4β1 by binding to site 2. A fibronectin fragment H120, a ligand specific to α4β1, binds to site 1, but does not bind to site 2 (14Fujita M. Takada Y.K. Takada Y. The chemokine fractalkine can activate integrins without CX3CR1 through direct binding to a ligand-binding site distinct from the classical RGD-binding site.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e96372Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Activation is defined by the increase in the binding of soluble integrin α4β1 to immobilized H120 by sCD40L. We found that sCD40L enhanced the binding of soluble α4β1 to H120 in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+ (Fig. 4B). Also, sCD40L enhanced the binding of FITC-labeled H120 to CHO cells that express recombinant α4β1 (α4-CHO cells) in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+ (Fig. 4C). The α4β1 activation (MFI) correlated well with the sCD40L concentrations, indicating that sCD40L activated cell-surface α4β1 (Fig. 4D). We studied if the four HIGM1 mutants that are clustered in the predicted site-2-binding site of CD40L can activate α4β1 on α4-CHO cells. The HIGM1 mutants were defective in activating cell surface α4β1. The K143T and G144E mutants were the most defective in activating α4β1 among four HIGM1 mutants (Fig. 4E), indicating that site-2-binding interface in α4β1 is similar to those of αvβ3 and α5β1. These findings suggest that α4β1 is a new receptor for CD40L. CD40L binds to site 2 and activates α4β1 in a manner similar to those of αvβ3 and α5β1. We further characterized the four HIGM1 mutants to determine the role of site 2 in CD40L signaling. They all bound to CD40 in ELISA (Fig. 5A). We tested their ability to bind to activated soluble αvβ3 in ELISA in the presence of 1 mM Mn2+, which reflects their ability to bind to site 1. S128R/E129G and L155P were defective and K143T and G144E were partially defective in binding to activated integrin αvβ3, suggesting that K143T and G144E are still able to bind to site 1 (Fig. 5B). S128R/E129G and L155P did not bind to activated αvβ3 (to site 1) although these mutations are not in the site-1-binding site in the trimeric interface. It is possible that these mutations induced conformational changes in the trimeric interface. We determined the ability of HIGM1 mutants to induce NF-kB activation in HEK293 reporter cells. The four mutants were all defective in inducing NF-kB activation in reporter cells, except that K143T is slightly active (Fig. 5C). K143T at high concentration (5 μg/ml) induced substantial NF-kB activation (Fig. 5D). We tested if excess (20-fold) mutants can suppress NF-kB activation by WT sCD40L. We found that all mutants tested suppressed NF-kB activation by WT sCD40L (Fig. 5D), indicating that they act as antagonists. We previously showed that eight other HIGM1 mutants, which are clustered in the trimeric interface, were defective in integrin binding (to site 1). Their defect in site 1 binding is likely related to their defect in CD40L signaling (13Takada Y.K. Yu J. Shimoda M. Takada Y. Integrin binding to the trimeric interface of CD40L plays a critical role in CD40/CD40L signaling.J. Immunol. 2019; 203: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The two mutants, K143T and G144E, still bind to site 1 but defective in integrin activation by binding to site 2. We thus propose that the binding of CD40L to site 2 is required for NF-kB activation. In the present study, we showed that sCD40L activated soluble and cell-surface integrins αvβ3, α5β1, and α4β1 in a dose-dependent manner. These findings indicate that this activation does not require inside-out signaling. Since cyclic site 2 peptide bound to sCD40L, it is suggested that sCD40L bound to site 2. Docking simulation using inactive/close headpiece αvβ3 as a target predicts that CD40L binds to site 2 and four HIGM1 mutants are clustered in the predicted site-2-binding site in CD40L (Fig. 6A). We showed that the HIGM1 mutants (particularly K143T and G144E) are defective in activating integrins, consistent with the prediction. The present study showed that sCD40L is a new allosteric activator of integrins by binding to site 2. The four HIGM1 mutants, including K143T and G144E, were defective in activating integrins αvβ3, α5β1, and α4β1 because they are defective in site 2 binding. This suggests that the defective binding of CD40L to site 2 is related to defective CD40L/CD40 signaling. Since integrins on normal blood cells (e.g., B cells) are not activated, it is possible that CD40L-mediated integrin activation by binding to site 2 is required for CD40L/CD40 signaling, in addition to site 1 binding. Previous study showed that eight HIGM1 mutants clustered in the trimeric interface are defective in integrin binding and in signaling because they are defective in site 1 binding (13Takada Y.K. Yu J. Shimoda M. Takada Y. Integrin binding to the trimeric interface of CD40L plays a critical role in CD40/CD40L signaling.J. Immunol. 2019; 203: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), indicating that the defect in integrin binding to site 1 is related to defective CD40L/CD40 signaling. We thus propose that CD40L-mediated integrin activation by binding to site 2 is also required for CD40L signaling. Since integrins are not activated in normal leukocytes, integrin activation by this mechanism will facilitate signaling by CD40L. It is well known that high concentrations of sCD40L (>1000-fold) are required to induce CD40L/CD40 signaling compared with membrane-bound CD40L. In our previous study, sCD40L at >1 μg/ml was needed to achieve maximal NF-kB activation in HEK293 reporter cells (13Takada Y.K. Yu J. Shimoda M. Takada Y.

We proposed that CD40L/CD40 signaling requires direct integrin binding to CD40L (and s"
https://openalex.org/W3128178481,"Background and purpose Establishment of drug therapy to prevent rupture of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (IAs) is needed. Previous human and animal studies have gradually clarified candidate drugs for preventive treatment of IA rupture. However, because most of these candidates belong to classes of drugs frequently co-administered to prevent cardiovascular diseases, epidemiological studies evaluating these drugs simultaneously should be performed. Furthermore, because drugs included in the same class may have different effects in terms of disease prevention, drug-by-drug assessments are important for planning intervention trials. Materials and methods We performed a cross-sectional study enrolling patients diagnosed with IAs between July 2011 and June 2019 at our institution. Patients were divided into ruptured or unruptured groups. The drugs investigated were selected according to evidence suggested by either human or animal studies. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association of drug treatment with rupture status. We also performed drug-by-drug assessments of the association, including dose-response relationships, with rupture status. Results In total, 310 patients with ruptured and 887 patients with unruptured IAs were included. Multivariate analysis revealed an inverse association of statins (odds ratio (OR), 0.54; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38–0.77), calcium channel blockers (OR, 0.41; 95% CI 0.30–0.58), and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (OR, 0.67; 95% CI 0.48–0.93) with ruptured IAs. Moreover, inverse dose-response relationships with rupture status were observed for pitavastatin and rosuvastatin among statins, benidipine, cilnidipine, and amlodipine among calcium channel blockers, and valsartan, azilsartan, candesartan, and olmesartan among ARBs. Only non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were positively associated with ruptured IAs (OR, 3.24; 95% CI 1.71–6.13). Conclusions The present analysis suggests that several types of statins, calcium channel blockers, and ARBs are candidate drugs for preventive treatment of unruptured IAs."

Methods Data on 759 patients with NPC diagnosed from 2007 to 2016 at Dr Sardjito General Hospital were included. Potential prognostic variables included sociodemographic, clinicopathology and treatment parameters. Multivariable analyses were implemented using semi-parametric Cox proportional hazards modelling and fully parametric survival analysis. Results The median time of observation was 14.39 months. In the whole cohort the median observed survival was 31.08 months. In the univariable analysis, age, education status, insurance type, BMI, ECOG index, stage and treatment strategy had an impact on overall survival (OS) (p values &lt;0.01). Semi-parametric multivariable analyses with stage stratification showed that education status, ECOG index, and treatment modality were independent prognostic factors for OS (p values &lt;0.05). In the fully parametric models age, education status, ECOG index, stage, and treatment modality were independent prognostic factors for OS (p values &lt;0.05). For both multivariable analyses, all treatment strategies were associated with a reduced hazard (semi-parametric models, p values &lt;0.05) and a better OS (parametric models, p values &lt;0.05) compared with no treatment. Furthermore, compared with radiation alone or chemotherapy alone, a combination of chemotherapy and radiation either in a form of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), sequential chemotherapy and radiation, or induction chemotherapy followed by CCRT demonstrated a reduced hazard (hazard ratio/HR 0.226, 95% confidence interval/CI 0.089–0.363, and HR 0.390, 95%CI 0.260–0.519) and a better OS (time ratio/TR 3.108, 95%CI 1.274–4.942 and TR 2.531, 95%CI 1.829–3.233) (p values &lt; 0.01). Conclusions Median OS for the cohort was low compared to those reported in both endemic and non-endemic regions. By combining the findings of multivariable analyses, we showed that age, education status, ECOG index, stage and first treatment modality were independent predictors for the OS."

https://openalex.org/W3128664591,"Since the discovery of the prolyl hydroxylases domain (PHD) proteins and their canonical hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) substrate two decades ago, a number of in vitro hydroxylation (IVH) assays for PHD activity have been developed to measure the PHD-HIF interaction. However, most of these assays either require complex proteomics mass spectrometry methods that rely on the specific PHD-HIF interaction or require the handling of radioactive material, as seen in the most commonly used assay measuring [14C]O2 release from labeled [14C]α-ketoglutarate. Here, we report an alternative rapid, cost-effective assay in which the consumption of α-ketoglutarate is monitored by its derivatization with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (2,4-DNPH) followed by treatment with concentrated base. We extensively optimized this 2,4-DNPH α-ketoglutarate assay to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio and demonstrated that it is robust enough to obtain kinetic parameters of the well-characterized PHD2 isoform comparable with those in published literature. We further showed that it is also sensitive enough to detect and measure the IC50 values of pan-PHD inhibitors and several PHD2 inhibitors in clinical trials for chronic kidney disease (CKD)-induced anemia. Given the efficiency of this assay coupled with its multiwell format, the 2,4-DNPH α-KG assay may be adaptable to explore non-HIF substrates of PHDs and potentially to high-throughput assays."

However, there is to date little research chronicling how people perceived their changed everyday lives and which consequences this had. In a two-wave study, we examined the psychological characteristics of people's situations and their correlates during shutdown in a large German sample (NT1 = 1,353; NT2 = 446). First, we compared characteristics during government-issued restrictions with retrospective accounts from before and with a follow-up assessment 6 to 7 months later when many restrictions had been lifted. We found that mean levels were lower and variances were higher for most characteristics during the shutdown. Second, the experience of certain situation characteristics was associated in meaningful and theoretically expected ways with people's traits, appraisals of the COVID-19 crisis, and subjective well-being. Lastly, situation characteristics often substantially explained the associations of traits with appraisals and well-being.

Regression coefficient for suicide mortality based on percentage change of ILI was calculated using a quasi-Poisson regression. Non-linear distributed lag models with quadratic function up to 24 weeks were constructed. Results The association between ILI and suicide mortality increased significantly up to 8 weeks post-influenza diagnosis. A significant positive association between ILI and suicide mortality was observed from 2009, when a novel influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus provoked a worldwide pandemic. No meaningful association between these factors was observed before 2009.

https://openalex.org/W3128369238,"Background Fever in neutropenia (FN) is a potentially life-threatening complication of chemotherapy in pediatric cancer patients. The current standard of care at most institutions is emergency hospitalization and empirical initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Methods We analyzed in retrospect FN episodes with bacteremia in pediatric cancer patients in a single center cohort from 1993 to 2012. We assessed the distribution of pathogens, the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility patterns, and their trends over time. Results From a total of 703 FN episodes reported, we assessed 134 FN episodes with bacteremia with 195 pathogens isolated in 102 patients. Gram-positive pathogens (124, 64%) were more common than Gram-negative (71, 36%). This proportion did not change over time (p = 0.26). Coagulase-negative staphylococci (64, 32%), viridans group streptococci (42, 22%), Escherichia coli (33, 17%), Klebsiella spp. (10, 5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (nine, 5%) were the most common pathogens. Comparing the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility patterns, the antimicrobial activity of ceftriaxone plus amikacin (64%; 95%CI: 56%-72%), cefepime (64%; 95%CI 56%-72%), meropenem (64%; 95%CI 56%-72), and piperacillin/tazobactam (62%; 95%CI 54%-70%), respectively, did not differ significantly. The addition of vancomycin to those regimens would have increased significantly in vitro activity to 99% for ceftriaxone plus amikacin, cefepime, meropenem, and 96% for piperacillin/tazobactam (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions Over two decades, we detected a relative stable pathogen distribution and found no relevant trend in the antibiotic susceptibility patterns.

https://openalex.org/W3128393601,"Background Refractive error is one of the commonly encountered problems during pregnancy and being the cause of deleterious effects on health. Despite its impacts, there is no evidence on the magnitude and associated factors of refractive error among pregnant women in Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of refractive error and its associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care unit at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, 2020. Methods An institution-based cross-sectional study was employed. An ocular examination was performed using Retinoscope and Snellen’s illiterate “E” chart. The required data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire which comprised socio-demographic, clinical and pregnancy-related variables. EpiData 3.02 and STATA 14 were used for data entry and analysis respectively. Both bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were executed to identify factors associated with refractive error. Variables with a p-value ≤ 0.05 in the multivariable logistic regression analysis were declared as significantly associated factors with refractive error. Results A total of 401 pregnant women with a median age of 27 (IQR = 24–31) years participated in this study. The overall prevalence of refractive error among the study participants was 35.66% (95% CI: 30.95–40.37). Of the total study participants, ninety-two (22.90%) of them were myopic, forty-five (11.22%) were hyperopic and the rest were antimetropic. Increased maternal age (AOR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.16–1.48)), increased parity (AOR = 3.17, 95% CI: 1.92–5.25), increased gestational age (AOR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.08–1.22), and regular use of computers/ watching television (AOR = 6.19, 95% CI: 2.46–15.59) were significantly associated with refractive error. Conclusion The prevalence of refractive error among pregnant women was high where myopia was the most common variety. Advanced maternal age, increased gestational age, increased parity and regular use of computer or watching television were significantly associated with refractive error among pregnant women. Therefore, apart from providing other maternal health services, routine screening and evaluation of pregnant women for refractive error during antenatal care visit is recommended to avoid its negative impacts."
https://openalex.org/W3128461071,"Science anxiety refers to students’ negative emotions about learning science. Across two studies, we investigated the psychometric properties of the newly developed Abbreviated Science Anxiety Scale (ASAS), which was adapted from the modified Abbreviated Math Anxiety Scale (m-AMAS) (Carey E., 2017). Using a sample of students in grades 7 to 10 ( N = 710), Study 1 reported a two-factor structure of the ASAS (learning science anxiety and science evaluation anxiety) and negative associations between the ASAS factors and science achievement. Study 2 replicated this two-factor model in students in grades 11 and 12 ( N = 362) and found that students in the “Arts” track were more anxious about science than those in “Sciences” track. Both studies consistently reported positive inter-correlations between the ASAS factors, with good internal reliabilities and modest meaningful associations with test anxiety and general anxiety, suggesting that science anxiety might be a distinct construct. Further, female students had higher science anxiety (especially science evaluation anxiety) than male students, even when test anxiety and general anxiety were considered in models. In summary, the ASAS is a brief, valid, and reliable instrument that can be used to guide and improve science education."
https://openalex.org/W3128680800,"Amnesia is a core diagnostic criterion for Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), however previous research has indicated memory transfer. As DID has been conceptualised as being a disorder of distinct identities, in this experiment, behavioral tasks were used to assess the nature of amnesia for episodic 1) self-referential and 2) autobiographical memories across identities. Nineteen DID participants, 16 DID simulators, 21 partial information, and 20 full information comparison participants from the general population were recruited. In the first study, participants were presented with two vignettes (DID and simulator participants received one in each of two identities) and asked to imagine themselves in the situations outlined. The second study used a similar methodology but with tasks assessing autobiographical experience. Subjectively, all DID participants reported amnesia for events that occurred in the other identity. On free recall and recognition tasks they presented a memory profile of amnesia similar to simulators instructed to feign amnesia and partial information comparisons. Yet, on tests of recognition, DID participants recognized significantly more of the event that occurred in another identity than simulator and partial information comparisons. As such, results indicate that the DID performance profile was not accounted for by true or feigned amnesia, lending support to the idea that reported amnesia may be more of a perceived than actual memory impairment."
https://openalex.org/W3128835576,"Significant research in reservoir computing over the past two decades has revived interest in recurrent neural networks. Owing to its ingrained capability of performing high-speed and low-cost computations this has become a panacea for multi-variate complex systems having non-linearity within their relationships. Modelling economic and financial trends has always been a challenging task owing to their volatile nature and no linear dependence on associated influencers. Prior studies aimed at effectively forecasting such financial systems, but, always left a visible room for optimization in terms of cost, speed and modelling complexities. Our work employs a reservoir computing approach complying to echo-state network principles, along with varying strengths of time-delayed feedback to model a complex financial system. The derived model is demonstrated to act robustly towards influence of trends and other fluctuating parameters by effectively forecasting long-term system behavior. Moreover, it also re-generates the financial system unknowns with a high degree of accuracy when only limited future data is available, thereby, becoming a reliable feeder for any long-term decision making or policy formulations."
https://openalex.org/W3129055079,"Introduction Several methods have been proposed to estimate the time of HIV seroconversion, including those based on CD4 cell depletion models. However, previous models have failed to consider the heterogeneity that exists in CD4 trajectories among different sub-populations. Our objective was to estimate the time from HIV seroconversion relative to the HIV diagnosis date in a population-based cohort of people living with HIV (PLWH) in the province of British Columbia, Canada. Methods We used linked administrative and clinical data from the British Columbia Seek and Treat for Optimal Prevention of HIV/AIDS (STOP HIV/AIDS) cohort, which contains longitudinal individual-level data on all PLWH ever diagnosed in the province. Eligible participants were aged ≥18 years and diagnosed with HIV between 1989 and 2013. The outcome was pre-antiretroviral treatment CD4 cell count measurements assessed every six months. Models were stratified by age and stage of HIV infection at diagnosis. Several explanatory variables were considered including longitudinal viral load measurements. Longitudinal CD4, square root transformed, was modeled via a non-linear mixed effects model; time was modeled using an exponential decay function. We assumed a Gaussian distribution (identity link), an AR(1) correlation structure, and a random intercept and slope for the longitudinal viral load measurements. Due to the population variation in CD4 count among uninfected individuals, we assumed 500 to 1500 cells/mm 3 as the normal range when estimating the time of HIV seroconversion. Results Longitudinal data on 1,253 individuals were analysed: 80% male, 33% White, and the median age at diagnosis was 38 years (25 th -75 th percentile [Q 1 -Q 3 ], 31 to 45). CD4 decay differed by stage of infection at diagnosis and age, with those ≥50 years in Stages 1 and 2 experiencing a faster decline in CD4 over time. The median duration of infection from seroconversion until HIV diagnosis was 6.9 (Q 1 -Q 3 , 3.9 to 10.1) years. Conclusions Considering the heterogeneity that exists in individual CD4 cell trajectories in a population, we presented a methodology that only relies on routinely collected HIV-related data, which can be further extended to estimate other epidemic measures."
https://openalex.org/W3126695884,"Topiramate is an anti-epileptic drug that is commonly prescribed not just to prevent seizures but also migraine headaches, with over 8 million prescriptions dispensed annually. Topiramate use during pregnancy has been linked to significantly increased risk of babies born with orofacial clefts (OFCs). However, the exact molecular mechanism of topiramate teratogenicity is unknown. In this study, we first used an unbiased antibody array analysis to test the effect of topiramate on human embryonic palatal mesenchyme (HEPM) cells. This analysis identified 40 differentially expressed proteins, showing strong connectivity to known genes associated with orofacial clefts. However, among known OFC genes, only TGFβ1 was significantly upregulated in the antibody array analysis. Next, we validated that topiramate could increase expression of TGFβ1 and of downstream target phospho-SMAD2 in primary mouse embryonic palatal mesenchyme (MEPM) cells. Furthermore, we showed that topiramate treatment of primary MEPM cells increased expression of SOX9. SOX9 overexpression in chondrocytes is known to cause cleft palate in mouse. We propose that topiramate mediates upregulation of TGFβ1 signaling through activation of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in the palate. TGFβ1 and SOX9 play critical roles in orofacial morphogenesis, and their abnormal overexpression provides a plausible etiologic molecular mechanism for the teratogenic effects of topiramate."
https://openalex.org/W3127123803,"Electron cryo-microscopy (Cryo-EM) is a powerful method for visualizing biological objects with up to near-angstrom resolution. Instead of chemical fixation, the method relies on very rapid freezing to immobilize the sample. Under these conditions, crystalline ice does not have time to form and distort structure. For many practical applications, the rate of cooling is fast enough to consider sample immobilization instantaneous, but in some cases, a more rigorous analysis of structure relaxation during freezing could be essential. This difficult yet important problem has been significantly under-reported in the literature, despite spectacular recent developments in Cryo-EM. Here we use Brownian dynamics modeling to examine theoretically the possible effects of cryo-immobilization on the apparent shapes of biological polymers. The main focus of our study is on tubulin protofilaments. These structures are integral parts of microtubules, which in turn are key elements of the cellular skeleton, essential for intracellular transport, maintenance of cell shape, cell division and migration. We theoretically examine the extent of protofilament relaxation within the freezing time as a function of the cooling rate, the filament’s flexural rigidity, and the effect of cooling on water’s viscosity. Our modeling suggests that practically achievable cooling rates are not rapid enough to capture tubulin protofilaments in conformations that are incompletely relaxed, suggesting that structures seen by cryo-EM are good approximations to physiological shapes. This prediction is confirmed by our analysis of curvatures of tubulin protofilaments, using samples, prepared and visualized with a variety of methods. We find, however, that cryofixation may capture incompletely relaxed shapes of more flexible polymers, and it may affect Cryo-EM-based measurements of their persistence lengths. This analysis will be valuable for understanding of structures of different types of biopolymers, observed with Cryo-EM."
https://openalex.org/W3126350354,"Foxp3 stability of vitamin C-treated induced-regulatory T cells (V-iTregs) is superior to that of conventional iTregs (C-iTregs). However, the role of V-iTregs in allograft rejection under vitamin C-deficient conditions, such as those seen in humans, remains unclear. We aimed to elucidate the role of vitamin C treatment on generation and maintenance of iTregs from gulo knockout (Gulo-KO) mice as well as wild type (WT) mice, and in vitro and in vivo suppressive effects of V-iTregs on heart allograft rejection in either Gulo-KO or WT recipient mice. Conversion efficiency of iTregs was similar between C- and V-iTregs in both WT and Gulo-KO mice. V-iTregs from WT or Gulo-KO mice showed better in vitro Foxp3 stability than C-iTregs, although there was no difference between WT V-iTregs and Gulo-KO V-iTregs. Furthermore, V-iTregs from WT or Gulo-KO mice suppressed in vitro T cell proliferation better than C-iTregs. Heterotrophic heart transplantation from BALB/c mice to WT or vitamin C-deficient Gulo-KO C57BL/6J mice was performed following adoptive transfer of C- or V-iTregs. V-iTregs as well as C-iTregs prolonged heart allograft survival in WT and Gulo-KO mice. However, there was no difference between the C- and V-iTreg groups. Supplementation of low- or high-dose vitamin C did not induce significant changes in heart allograft survival in Gulo-KO recipients that had received V-iTregs. In conclusion, V-iTregs do not exert better suppressive effects on heart allograft survival than C-iTregs in either WT or vitamin C-deficient recipients."

https://openalex.org/W3127734478,"Background Radiation dose reduction is a major concern in patients who undergo computed tomography (CT) to follow liver and renal abscess. Objectives The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of ultralow-dose CT with iterative reconstruction (IR) to follow patients with liver and renal abscess. Methods This prospective study included 18 patients who underwent ultralow-dose CT with IR to follow abscesses (liver abscesses in 10 patients and renal abscesses in 8 patients; ULD group). The control group consisted of 14 patients who underwent follow-up standard-dose CT for liver abscesses during the same period. The objective image noise was evaluated by measuring standard deviation (SD) in the liver and subcutaneous fat to select a specific IR for qualitative analysis. Two radiologists independently evaluated subjective image quality, noise, and diagnostic confidence to evaluate abscess using a five-point Likert scale. Qualitative parameters were compared between the ULD and control groups with the Mann-Whitney U test. Results The mean CT dose index volume and dose length product of standard-dose CT were 8.7 ± 1.8 mGy and 555.8 ± 142.8 mGy·cm, respectively. Mean dose reduction of ultralow-dose CT was 71.8% compared to standard-dose CT. After measuring SDs, iDose level 5, which showed similar SD to standard-dose CT in both the subcutaneous fat and liver ( P = 0.076, and P = 0.124), was selected for qualitative analysis. Ultralow-dose CT showed slightly worse subjective image quality ( P &lt; 0.001 for reader 1, and P = 0.005 for reader 2) and noise ( P = 0.004 for reader 1, and P = 0.001 for reader 2) than standard-dose CT. However, the diagnostic confidence of ultralow-dose CT for evaluating abscess was comparably excellent to standard-dose CT ( P = 0.808 for reader 1, and P = 0.301 for reader 2). Conclusions Ultralow-dose CT with IR can be used in the follow-up of liver and renal abscess with comparable diagnostic confidence."
