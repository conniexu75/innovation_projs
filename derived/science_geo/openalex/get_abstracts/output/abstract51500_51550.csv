https://openalex.org/W2050260317,"Human monocytes, macrophages, and certain lymphocytes bind firmly to red cells coated with immunoglobulin G, whether or not it is acting as antibody. Monocyte binding is specific for cells coated with immunoglobulin G and is inhibited specifically by this immunoglobulin or its Fc-fragment in solution. Although not involving serum complement and not usually a prelude to erythrophagocytosis, this binding causes rapid morphological injury to red cells, as manifested by their sphering, increased osmotic fragility, deformation, and fragmentation. It is inferred that mononuclear cells have specific surface receptors for immunoglobulin G and that these provide a critical phase of the mechanism in vivo, whereby red cells or other particles coated with antibody are apprehended and destroyed."

https://openalex.org/W1486858051,"Abstract The autosomally inherited glucose-6-P dehydrogenase of liver has now been found to catalyze the oxidation not only of galactose-6-P, as previously reported, but also glucose and 2-deoxyglucose-6-P. The enzyme was localized in the microsomal fraction of liver. The pH optimum of the enzyme was dependent not only upon the hexose used as substrate, but also upon the substrate concentration. The Michaelis constant was very pH-sensitive and ranged from less than 0.005 mm for galactose-6-P with NAD as hydrogen acceptor to over 4000 mm when glucose served as substrate and NADP as the hydrogen acceptor. Purification and electrophoretic studies indicate that the dehydrogenase activities with glucose, glucose-6-P, 2-deoxyglucose-6-P, and galactose-6-P as substrate are properties of the same enzyme."

It reacted with all of 42 myeloma serums of the immunoglobulin G type tested, but no more than approximately 50 percent of the total myeloma protein was ever precipitated. The fact that not all of the protein was precipitated and that the amounts precipitated varied from serum to serum may be interpreted as demonstrating heterogeneity of the carbohydrate in these myeloma proteins. Other glycoproteins precipitated by concanavalin A were identified, and subsequently separated from concanavalin A by chromatography."

https://openalex.org/W2040238348,"Administration of glucose, fructose, and glycerol to fasted rats produced a significant depression of liver phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity within 4 to 8 hours; galactose and ribose were much less effective. All the compounds yielded appreciable quantities of liver glycogen. The depression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity by glucose and glycerol was diminished by the concomitant administration of 2-deoxyglucose. The latter depressed glycogen formation from administered carbohydrate in muscle but not in liver. In rats made diabetic by alloxan, depression of elevated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity by insulin was dependent upon a dietary source of carbohydrate. These results were interpreted to indicate that depression of certain gluconeogenic enzymes after carbohydrate ingestion is initiated by the metabolism of carbohydrate in some extrahepatic site."

https://openalex.org/W1974119153,"WE have already investigated the production of immunoglobulin G (IgG) by mouse plasma cell tumour 5563 and have shown that light chains are released autonomously from polyribosomes into a pool of free light chains. The time course of incorporation of radioactive amino-acids into free light chain and the myeloma protein indicated that the pool of free light chains is small and reaches maximum radioactivity after about 10 min of incubation. It behaves as a pool with rapid turnover from which light chains appear to be incorporated into G myeloma protein molecules1,2. These findings led us to propose the possibility that the pool of free light chains controls the release of heavy chains from the polyribosomes."

https://openalex.org/W1975008165,"Experiments were performed to test which structure of frog skin epithelium is responsible for the electrical excitation (fast, all-or-none potential spike) displayed by this tissue during stimulation with a current pulse. Preselected cells of the outer epithelial surface were punctured by microelectrodes under microscopical observation. The major part of the transepithelia resting resistance and the major part of the spike were recorded between microelectrode tip and outside bathing solution. A leak between microelectrode and punctured membrane is made responsible for the attenuation of spike amplitude observed under these recording conditions. It is shown that if the spike is generated at but one of the series membranes of the epithelium, this membrane must be at the outermost border of the tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1519611422,"Abstract The introduction of spatially ordered structure into poly Glu52Lys33Tyr15 by intramolecular cross-linking does not change its immunogenicity, but markedly alters its antigenic specificity. The antigenic sites involving the cross-link are much more potent in directing antibody specificity than sites on the linear portions of the polypeptide chain. The presence of these cross-linked antigenic sites, however, does not destroy the antigenic sites on the linear portions of the polypeptide chain, and the latter are capable of reacting completely with antibody directed against them. There is variation in the specificity of different types of spatially organized structure: those formed by an amide cross-link between the side chains of lysine and glutamic acid are more specific than those formed by a dinitrophenylene cross-link connecting lysine residues, tyrosine residues, or both. In addition, the antibody specificity increases as the number of cross-links increases. A series of cross-reaction and inhibition studies shows that the dinitrophenylene group introduces a potent antigenic determinant which is composed of the dinitrophenylene ring and a portion of the polypeptide chain attached to each side of the ring. The size of the antigenic sites on polypeptides varies inversely as the potency of the determinant: linear sites on the polypeptide chain consists of 13 to 19 amino acid residues; the dinitrophenylene determinant involves the dinitrophenylene ring, the amino acids to which it is connected, and a few adjacent amino acids; and the dinitrophenyl-determinant consists of the dinitrophenyl-residue, the amino acid to which it is attached, and a few adjacent amino acid residues."

https://openalex.org/W1909540394,"Abstract Polyribosomes were isolated from lysates of rabbit spleens or lymph nodes that were removed 4 to 5 days after injection with bovine serum albumin. The presence of the heavy or light chains of rabbit immunoglobulin G on the various polyribosomes was examined by indirect precipitation with goat antisera to each of the polypeptide chains. When the polyribosomes were prepared from tissues incubated with labeled amino acids, both antisera precipitated radioactivity from one ribosomal aggregate with a sedimentation constant of about 200 to 250 S. An approximate 6-fold molar excess of light to heavy chains was detected. This same group of polyribosomes also bound antigen (bovine serum albumin), which indicates that the combining site for antigen was present on the polypeptide chains before their release from the ribosomes. The unbound intracellular protein of the cells was examined for free and combined heavy and light chains. Of the total γ-globulin protein within the cell, about 13% was found to be free light chains and about 8% free heavy chains."

https://openalex.org/W2073257660,"THE Malayan aborigines form a distinct ethnic group which is socially and anthropologically different from the three main population groups in Malaya—the Malays, the Chinese and the Indians. The aborigines live mostly in the jungle, follow their own customs and beliefs and have little contact with non-aborigines. They are plagued by diseases, the most common of which are malaria and tuberculosis. Genetically the aborigines are of particular interest. Studies have revealed high frequencies in this population of certain haematological abnormalities: haemoglobin E ranges from 8 to 50 per cent in different groups1, glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) dehydrogenase deficiency from 8 to 23 per cent1, and hereditary ovalocytosis is found in 12.3 per cent of aborigines examined2. These high frequencies may be due to malaria or inbreeding or both. We now report the results of a preliminary study of haptoglobins, transferrins and serum gamma-globulin types in Malayan aborigines."

We discuss here racial differences in the synthesis of gamma-globulins, and increased exposure to chronic infections, the latter resulting in an increased production of humoral antibodies. Chronic liver disease can easily be excluded as a cause."
