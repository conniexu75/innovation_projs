https://openalex.org/W2075262814,"The x-ray flux from the Crab Nebula was observed during a lunar occultation on 7 July 1964. As the moon covered the central region of the nebula, the x-ray flux decreased gradually. The source appears to extend over a volume about 1 light-year in diameter."

https://openalex.org/W2010079248,In marine animals the rate of excretion of dissolved phosphorus per unit weight increases as body weight decreases. As a consequence microzooplankton may play a major role in planktonic nutrient regeneration.
https://openalex.org/W2067719986,"Organic matter in the sedimentary Biwabik iron formation in northern Minnesota shows a progressive increase in crystallinity where the formation is metamorphosed by the intrusive Duluth gabbro complex. X-ray diffraction of acid-insoluble residues shows that there is a complete range in crystallinity, from amorphous material in the unmetamorphosed sediments to completely crystalline graphite adjacent to the gabbro."

https://openalex.org/W1979671386,"I have touched upon the great variety of crystal forms and dendritic forms in nature, have discussed the essential physics involved in the generation of these forms during either constrained or unconstrained crystal growth, and have shown how this knowledge helps in the classification of this seemingly infinite variety of forms. Man has built upon this understanding to control the form and dimensions of certain materials to his technological advantage. We may hope that, in the future, we will have greater understanding of these phenomena of natural crystal growth and the ability to use this knowledge for technological ends."

Six of the 22 birds returned across the continent to San Jose to be recaptured during the winter of 1963-64."
https://openalex.org/W4247423804,Zircon (ZrSiO(5)) has been identified as an accessory mineral in the Vaca Muerta mesosiderite and in the troilite nodules of the Toluca iron meteorite. The occurrence in Vaca Muerta is a new discovery confirmned by electron-probe nmicroanalysis of a grain in a polished section of the meteorite. Our identification of zircon in Toluca substantiates an occurrence in this meteorite reported in 1895 by Laspeyres and Kaiser.
https://openalex.org/W2000297624,"Stages in the discharge of sporangia by the fungus, Pilobolus kleinii, were photographed by means of a high-speed electronic flash triggered by a photocell. The photographs confirm that the sporangium is propelled by a jet of cell sap. The jet is deflected from the sporangium and attains a considerable length before it breaks into droplets."

https://openalex.org/W1967525950,A migration of gravid Syphacia muris pinworms down the large intestine of the rat host is shown to occur from the seventh day on in the worm's life cycle. Eggs obtained from migrating worms have proved to be infective to helminth-free rats after incubation in saline for 30 minutes at room temperature and 4 hours at 37 degrees C.

https://openalex.org/W2083489978,Controlled environment studies of Pennisetum clandestinum showed that at 10 degrees C stamens of the male-fertile strain were not exserted from the floret although stigmas emerged normally. At higher temperatures both stamens and stigmas were exserted. Pollen abortion was high at 10 degrees C and was increased by lengthening photoperiod. Flowering of the male-sterile strain was not changed by any temperature or photoperiod. These responses to temperature may explain the natural sterility during the cool season.

https://openalex.org/W2090206107,"lipids, the acetone fraction had a marked inactivating action as well as a low surface tension; the ether and hot alcohol-ether fractions were only moderately active, irrespective of surface tension. The inactivation of neurotropic viruses by serum lipids is now being investigated in connection with (a) the mechanism, including influence of the degree of dispersion, and closer identification of the active agent; (b) the bearing of the results on the neutralization test as it is now carried out; and (c) its possibilities as the basis for chemotherapy of experimental infections."

https://openalex.org/W2024835460,"A new species of the genus Monodella (class Crustacea, order Thermosbaenacea) has been found in a cave pool in Texas. Previously the order was believed to be restricted to the Mediterranean area. The new evidence indicates that the order is older than was believed, or that invasion of fresh or brackish water has occurred more than once within the order."

https://openalex.org/W1990202680,"A stock of tobacco with 23 pairs of tobacco chromosomes and one substituted pair from Nicotiana glutinosa was available. An amphiploid of this tobacco with N. tomentosiformis was synthesized in order to test whether preferential pairing is determined by the homologies of the chromosomes or whether it is under genic control. Characteristically, segregates for duplex loci in N. tabacum x N. tomentosiformis amphiploids give a gametic output of about 3:1, but for a factor on the substituted chromosome that output was found to be 59:1. The result suggests that preferential pairing in this material is not genically determined."

https://openalex.org/W2099549508,"Several investigators have reported that 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and certain other plant growthregulators are readily leached from soils (2, 3, 7). NUTMAN et al. (7) found that leaching equivalent to I.4 inches of water resulted in a loss of 2,4-D from the soil but that far greater volumes of water did not completely remove it. This would indicate that some 2,4-D may be adsorbed by the soil. HANKS (3) studied rates of leaching of 2,4-D and its calcium salt from six types of soil and found that the two compounds were leached from any one soil at about equal rates, as shown by comparative toxicities of the leachatesn but were differentially leached from the various soits. It was recently shown by LUCAS and HAMNER (5) that 2,4-D is inactivated by adsorption on charcoal. Bean plants sprayed with a o. ISo solution of sodium 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate, which had been mixed and shaken with I%o activated charcoal? showed little injury. The degree of adsotption of several growth-regulators by certain ion-exchange materials and also the readiness with which the compounds are eluted after having been adsorbed are reported here. Growth of plants in exchanger materials containing an adsorbed growthregulator was also obserrred. Such studies may help to explain why herbicidal growth-regulators vary in toxicity in different soils and why the rates of leaching of the compounds from different soils may vary. A spectrophotometric method developed by BANDURSKI (I) for determining growth-regulators in solution made possible quantitative studies of adsorption and leaching of such compounds which could heretofore be done only with difficulty when using bioassays (6, 8)."

https://openalex.org/W2031618205,A cosmological model based on a gravitational plasma of matter and antimatter is discussed. The antigravitational interaction of matter and antimatter leads to segregation and an expansion of the plasma universe. The expansion time scale is controlled by the aggregation time scale.
