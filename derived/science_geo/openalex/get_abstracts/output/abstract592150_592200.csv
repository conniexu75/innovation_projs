https://openalex.org/W2740222998,"The Mediterranean dietary pattern has been associated with a decreased risk of many degenerative diseases and cognitive function in particular; however, relevant information from Mediterranean regions, where the prototype Mediterranean diet is typically adhered to, have been very limited. Additionally, predefined Mediterranean diet (MeDi) scores with use of a priori cut-offs have been used very rarely, limiting comparisons between different populations and thus external validity of the associations. Finally, associations between individual components of MeDi (i.e., food groups, macronutrients) and particular aspects of cognitive performance have rarely been explored. We evaluated the association of adherence to an a priori defined Mediterranean dietary pattern and its components with dementia and specific aspects of cognitive function in a representative population cohort in Greece.Participants from the Hellenic Longitudinal Investigation of Ageing and Diet (HELIAD), an on-going population-based study, exploring potential associations between diet and cognitive performance in a representative sample from Greek regions, were included in this analysis. Diagnosis of dementia was made by a full clinical and neuropsychological evaluation, while cognitive performance was assessed according to five cognitive domains (memory, language, attention-speed, executive functioning, visuospatial perception) and a composite cognitive score. Adherence to MeDi was evaluated by an a priori score (range 0-55), derived from a detailed food frequency questionnaire.Among 1,865 individuals (mean age 73±6 years, 41% male), 90 were diagnosed with dementia and 223 with mild cognitive impairment. Each unit increase in the Mediterranean dietary score (MedDietScore) was associated with a 10% decrease in the odds for dementia. Adherence to the MeDi was also associated with better performance in memory, language, visuospatial perception and the composite cognitive score; the associations were strongest for memory. Fish consumption was negatively associated with dementia and cognitive performance positively associated with non-refined cereal consumption.Our results suggest that adherence to the MeDi is associated with better cognitive performance and lower dementia rates in Greek elders. Thus, the MeDi in its a priori constructed prototype form may have cognitive benefits in traditional Mediterranean populations."

However, the underlying mechanism in HULC up-regulation is poorly understood. We hypothesized that HULC might modulate the oncogene high mobility group A2 (HMGA2) to promote hepatocarcinogenesis. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the expression levels of HULC were positively correlated with those of HMGA2 in clinical HCC tissues. Interestingly, we also observed that HULC could up-regulate HMGA2 in HCC cells. Mechanistically, we found that the microRNA-186 inhibited HMGA2 expression by targeting the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of HMGA2 mRNA. Strikingly, HULC acted as a competing noncoding RNA to sequester miR-186 and thereby relieved miR-186–mediated HMGA2 repression. Functionally, HMGA2 knockdown decreased the HULC-enhanced growth of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that the long noncoding RNA HULC increases HMGA2 expression by sequestering miR-186 post-transcriptionally and thereby promotes liver cancer growth, providing new insights into the mechanism by which HULC enhances hepatocarcinogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2739876826,"Despite enzyme replacement therapy, disease progression is observed in patients with Fabry disease. Identification of factors that predict disease progression is needed to refine guidelines on initiation and cessation of enzyme replacement therapy. To study the association of potential biochemical and clinical prognostic factors with the disease course (clinical events, progression of cardiac and renal disease) we retrospectively evaluated 293 treated patients from three international centers of excellence. As expected, age, sex and phenotype were important predictors of event rate. Clinical events before enzyme replacement therapy, cardiac mass and eGFR at baseline predicted an increased event rate. eGFR was the most important predictor: hazard ratios increased from 2 at eGFR <90 ml/min/1.73m2 to 4 at eGFR <30, compared to patients with an eGFR >90. In addition, men with classical disease and a baseline eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73m2 had a faster yearly decline (-2.0 ml/min/1.73m2) than those with a baseline eGFR of >60. Proteinuria was a further independent risk factor for decline in eGFR. Increased cardiac mass at baseline was associated with the most robust decrease in cardiac mass during treatment, while presence of cardiac fibrosis predicted a stronger increase in cardiac mass (3.36 gram/m2/year). Of other cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension significantly predicted the risk for clinical events. In conclusion, besides increasing age, male sex and classical phenotype, faster disease progression while on enzyme replacement therapy is predicted by renal function, proteinuria and to a lesser extent cardiac fibrosis and hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2740722812,"Extremely brachycephalic, or short-muzzled, dog breeds such as pugs, French bulldogs, and bulldogs are prone to the conformation-related respiratory disorder—brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS). Affected dogs present with a wide range of clinical signs from snoring and exercise intolerance, to life-threatening events such as syncope. In this study, conformational risk factors for BOAS that could potentially aid in breeding away from BOAS were sought. Six hundred and four pugs, French bulldogs, and bulldogs were included in the study. Soft tape measurements of the head and body were used and the inter-observer reproducibility was evaluated. Breed-specific models were developed to assess the associations between the conformational factors and BOAS status based on functional grading. The models were further validated by means of a BOAS index, which is an objective measurement of respiratory function using whole-body barometric plethysmography. The final models have good predictive power for discriminating BOAS (-) and BOAS (+) phenotypes indicated by the area under the curve values of >80% on the receiver operating curves. When other factors were controlled, stenotic nostrils were associated with BOAS in all three breeds; pugs and bulldogs with higher body condition scores (BCS) had a higher risk of developing BOAS. Among the standardized conformational measurements (i.e. craniofacial ratio (CFR), eye width ratio (EWR), skull index (SI), neck girth ratio (NGR), and neck length ratio (NLR)), for pugs EWR and SI, for French bulldogs NGR and NLR, and for bulldogs SI and NGR showed significant associations with BOAS status. However, the NGR in bulldogs was the only significant predictor that also had satisfactory inter-observer reproducibility. A NGR higher than 0.71 in male bulldogs was predictive of BOAS with approximately 70% sensitivity and specificity. In conclusion, stenotic nostrils, BCS, and NGR were found to be valid, easily applicable predictors for BOAS (+)."
https://openalex.org/W2742100186,"Systemic sclerosis-related interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) is the leading cause of death in SSc. In this study, we aimed to describe the baseline severity and evolution of forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) in patients with SSc-ILD and to assess the baseline clinical, biological and high-resolution CT scan (HRCT) predictors of this evolution. Baseline and serial FVC and DLCO were collected in 75 SSc-ILD patients followed during 6.4±4.2 years (n = 557 individual data). FVC and DLCO evolution was modelled using a linear mixed model with random effect. During follow-up, FVC was stable while DLCO significantly decreased (-1.5±0.3%/year (p<0.0001). Baseline NYHA functional class III/IV, extensive SSc-ILD on HRCT and DLCO<80% were associated with a lower baseline FVC. Absence of digital ulcers extensive SSc-ILD, and FVC<80% and were associated with a lower baseline DLCO. Presence or history of digital ulcers and presence of pulmonary hypertension at baseline or during follow-up were associated with a faster decline of DLCO overtime. Neither age, gender, subtype of SSc nor specificity of autoantibodies were associated with baseline severity or outcome of lung function tests. In this SSc-ILD population, FVC was therefore stable while DLCO significantly declined over time. ILD extension was associated with baseline FVC and DLCO but not with their evolution. Presence or history of digital ulcers and pulmonary hypertension were predictors of a faster decline of DLCO over time."
https://openalex.org/W2739483074,"Zearalenone (ZEN) is a non-steroidal estrogenic mycotoxin produced by Fusarium species, which has been shown to be associated with reproductive disorders in livestock, and to a lesser extent with hyperoestrogenic syndromes in humans. The aim of this study was to characterize a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain with ZEN removal ability. A pure culture of a strain designated LN isolated from moldy corn samples showed a high ZEN removal capability. Based on microscopic observations, biochemical characteristics, and phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence, LN was identified as B. amyloliquefaciens. After incubation of B. amyloliquefaciens LN in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 3.5 ppm of ZEN, the ZEN concentration fell below the detection limit within 24 h. In ZEN-contaminated corn meal medium, B. amyloliquefaciens LN decreased ZEN concentration by 92% after 36 h of incubation. In phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5 ppm of ZEN, B. amyloliquefaciens LN reduced the ZEN concentration from 5 ppm to 3.28 ppm immediately after coming into contact with ZEN, and further reduced the ZEN concentration to 0.36 ppm after 4 h of incubation. The amounts of ZEN adsorbed by the cells of B. amyloliquefaciens LN did not increase with the extension of incubation time, indicating that B. amyloliquefaciens LN not only possessed ZEN adsorption ability, but also exhibited the ability to degrade ZEN. In addition, B. amyloliquefaciens LN was non-hemolytic, non-enterotoxin producing, and displayed probiotic characteristics including acidic tolerance, bile salt tolerance, and anti-pathogenic activities. These findings suggest that B. amyloliquefaciens LN has a potential to be used as a feed additive to reduce the concentrations of ZEN in feedstuffs."
https://openalex.org/W2741889880,"In visceral leishmaniasis, we found that the antileishmanial drug Amp B produces a higher level of IL-1β over the infected control. Moreover, administering anti-IL-1β antibody to infected Amp B–treated mice showed significantly less parasite clearance. Investigation revealed that Leishmania inhibits stimuli-induced expression of a multiprotein signaling platform, NLRP3 inflammasome, which in turn inhibits caspase-1 activation mediated maturation of IL-1β from its pro form. Attenuation of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β in infection was found to result from decreased NF-κB activity. Transfecting infected cells with constitutively active NF-κB plasmid increased NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β expression but did not increase mature IL-1β, suggesting that IL-1β maturation requires a second signal, which was found to be reactive oxygen species (ROS). Decreased NF-κB was attributed to increased expression of A20, a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling. Silencing A20 in infected cells restored NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β expression, but also increased matured IL-1β, implying an NF-κB-independent A20-modulated IL-1β maturation. Macrophage ROS is primarily regulated by mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), and UCP2-silenced infected cells showed an increased IL-1β level. Short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of A20 and UCP2 in infected mice independently documented decreased liver and spleen parasite burden and increased IL-1β production. These results suggest that Leishmania exploits A20 and UCP2 to impair inflammasome activation for disease propagation.—Gupta, A. K., Ghosh, K., Palit, S., Barua, J., Das, P. K., Ukil, A.

https://openalex.org/W2741797547,"This study was envisaged to comprehensively profile genes in selected tissues along with a few biochemical indicators and integrate resulting information with dietary selenium (Se) deficiency symptoms in broilers. A total of 120 one-day-old Cobb male broilers were equally divided into two groups and fed a Se deficient corn-soybean-based basal diet supplemented with 0.3 mg/kg sodium selenite (Control, Se adequate) or without selenite (Se deficiency) for five weeks. Effects of Se deficiency on mRNA abundance of twenty-three selenoprotein encoding genes and seventeen insulin signaling related genes were studied at day 35 in pancreas, liver and muscle along with plasma biochemical constituents and enzyme activities. Compared to healthy birds in control diet, Se deficient diet induced deficiency symptoms in 90% birds and classic nutritional pancreatic atrophy, depressed growth performance of broilers, and decreased (P < 0.01 to P < 0.05) total antioxidant capacity and activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in plasma and three other tissues. Se deficiency resulted in 58% higher mortality than control birds. Dietary Se deficiency down-regulated (P < 0.01-0.05) eighteen selenoprotein encoding genes in pancreas, fourteen genes in muscle and nine genes in liver, and up-regulated (P < 0.05) Txnrd1 and Selx in liver. Meanwhile, six, thirteen and five insulin signaling related genes were down-regulated (P < 0.01-0.05) in pancreas, muscle and liver, respectively, and three genes were up-regulated (P < 0.01) in liver. The decrease (P < 0.05) in levels of plasma insulin, total triglyceride and total cholesterol, and concurrent elevated (P < 0.05) levels of plasma glucose and inflammatory cytokines accompanied the global down-regulation of selenoprotein encoding- and insulin signaling related- genes in Se deficient birds. It was concluded that dietary Se deficiency induces nutritional pancreatic atrophy and metabolic disorder of glucose and lipid in broilers via down-regulation of selenoprotein encoding- and insulin signaling related- genes, indicating potential roles of these genes in metabolic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2740226552,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes respiratory disease leading to loss of egg and meat production in chickens. Although it is known that macrophage numbers are elevated in the respiratory tract of IBV infected chickens, the role played by macrophages in IBV infection, particularly as a target cell for viral replication, is unknown. In this study, first, we investigated the ability of IBV to establish productive replication in macrophages in lungs and trachea in vivo and in macrophage cell cultures in vitro using two pathogenic IBV strains. Using a double immunofluorescent technique, we observed that both IBV Massachusetts-type 41 (M41) and Connecticut A5968 (Conn A5968) strains replicate in avian macrophages at a low level in vivo. This in vivo observation was substantiated by demonstrating IBV antigens in macrophages following in vitro IBV infection. Further, IBV productive infection in macrophages was confirmed by demonstrating corona viral particles in macrophages and IBV ribonucleic acid (RNA) in culture supernatants. Evaluation of the functions of macrophages following infection of macrophages with IBV M41 and Conn A5968 strains revealed that the production of antimicrobial molecule, nitric oxide (NO) is inhibited. It was also noted that replication of IBV M41 and Conn A5968 strains in macrophages does not interfere with the induction of type 1 IFN activity by macrophages. In conclusion, both M41 and Con A5968 IBV strains infect macrophages in vivo and in vitro resulting productive replications. During the replication of IBV in macrophages, their ability to produce NO can be affected without affecting the ability to induce type 1 IFN activity. Further studies are warranted to uncover the significance of macrophage infection of IBV in the pathogenesis of IBV infection in chickens."
https://openalex.org/W2740489126,"Background Attentional complaints are common in narcolepsy patients and can overlap with daytime sleepiness features. Few studies attempted to characterize attentional domains in narcolepsy leading to controversial results. We aimed to assess the impact of hypocretin deficiency on attentional functioning by comparing performances on the attention network test (ANT) of narcoleptic patients with hypocretin deficiency (narcolepsy type 1—NT1) versus patients without hypocretin deficiency (narcolepsy type 2—NT2) and healthy controls. We also addressed frequency and severity of psychopathological symptoms and their influence on performances on ANT. Methods Twenty-one NT1 patients, fifteen NT2 patients and twenty-two healthy controls underwent the ANT, which allows assessing three separate attentional processes (alerting, orienting and executive control), and a psychometric assessment including questionnaires on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety and depression symptoms. Results NT1 and NT2 patients presented with slower reaction times compared to controls. NT1 patients exhibited an impairment of alerting network relative to NT2 and healthy controls, while orienting and executive control networks efficiency were comparable between groups. NT1 and NT2 displayed higher severity of ADHD inattentive domain than controls, NT1 patients also displayed higher severity of ADHD hyperactive domain and depressive symptoms. In NT1, ADHD and depressive symptoms were positively correlated. Conclusions Despite a shared slowing of reaction times in both NT1 and NT2, a selective impairment of alerting network was present only in hypocretin deficient patients. Clinicians should carefully consider attentional deficits and psychopathological symptoms, including ADHD symptoms, in the clinical assessment and management of patients with narcolepsy."
https://openalex.org/W2740363586,"Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are used extensively as a gene delivery vehicle for retinal gene therapy, yet its ability to target the anterior segment of the eye, critical to unlocking therapeutic opportunities, is less characterized. Previously, self-complimentary (sc) AAV was shown to be necessary for transduction of the cornea and trabecular meshwork (TM), limiting the size of the gene transfer cassette, likely due to a block in second strand synthesis thought to be required for functional transduction. Here, we evaluated several AAV capsids in a single stranded (ss) genome conformation for their ability to overcome the need for scAAV for targeting corneal endothelium and TM. AAV2, 8, and a recently synthetically developed AAV called Anc80L65 were evaluated in vitro and in vivo by intracameral injection in mice. Results show that although scAAV2 demonstrated superior infectivity in vitro including Human Trabecular meshwork (HTM) immortalized cell lines; Anc80L65 transduced following a single intracameral injection efficiently all components of the mouse anterior segment, including the TM, corneal stroma, and endothelial cells. These results suggest that Anc80L65 is able to overcome the requirement for scAAV genomes to enable TM and corneal targeting, expanding the potential experimental and therapeutic use of AAV gene transfer in the anterior segment of the eye."
https://openalex.org/W2740427837,"In this study micro-sensors were employed to analyse macro-kinematic parameters during a classical cross-country skiing competition (10 km, 2-lap). Data were collected from eight male participants during the Australian championship competition wearing a single micro-sensor unit (MinimaxX™, S4) positioned on their upper back. Algorithms and visual classification were used to identify skiing sub-techniques and calculate velocities, cycle lengths (CL) and cycle rates (CR) over the entire course. Double poling (DP) was the predominant cyclical sub-technique utilised (43 ± 5% of total distance), followed by diagonal stride (DS, 16 ± 4%) and kick double poling (KDP, 5 ± 4%), with the non-propulsive Tuck technique accounting for 24 ± 4% of the course. Large within-athlete variances in CL and CR occurred, particularly for DS (CV% = 25 ± 2% and CV% = 15 ± 2%, respectively). For all sub-techniques the mean CR on both laps and for the slower and faster skiers were similar, while there was a trend for the mean velocities in all sub-techniques by the faster athletes to be higher. Overall velocity and mean DP-CL were significantly higher on Lap 1, with no significant change in KDP-CL or DS-CL between laps. Distinct individual velocity thresholds for transitions between sub-techniques were observed. Clearly, valuable insights into cross-country skiing performance can be gained through continuous macro-kinematic monitoring during competition."
https://openalex.org/W2739681828,"Adenosine, a key extracellular signaling mediator, regulates several aspects of metabolism by activating 4 G-protein-coupled receptors, the A1, A2A, A2B, and A3 adenosine receptors (ARs). The role of A2AARs in regulating high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced metabolic derangements is unknown. To evaluate the role of A2AARs in regulating glucose and insulin homeostasis in obesity, we fed A2AAR-knockout (KO) and control mice an HFD for 16 wk to initiate HFD-induced metabolic disorder. We found that genetic deletion of A2AARs caused impaired glucose tolerance in mice fed an HFD. This impaired glucose tolerance was caused by a decrease in insulin secretion but not in insulin sensitivity. Islet size and insulin content in pancreata of A2AAR-deficient mice were decreased compared with control mice after consuming an HFD. A2AAR-KO mice had decreased expression of the β-cell-specific markers pdx1, glut2, mafA, and nkx6.1 and increased expression of the dedifferentiation markers sox2 and hes1. Ex vivo islet experiments confirmed the role of A2AARs in protecting against decreased insulin content and release caused by HFD. Other experiments with bone marrow chimeras revealed that inflammation was not the primary cause of decreased insulin secretion in A2AAR-KO mice. Altogether, our data showed that A2AARs control pancreatic dysfunction in HFD-induced obesity.-Csóka, B., Törő, G., Vindeirinho, J., Varga, Z. V., Koscsó, B., Németh, Z.

https://openalex.org/W2739637159,"Biologically active metal ions in low doses have the potential to accelerate bone defect healing. For successful remodelling the interaction of bone graft materials with both bone-forming osteoblasts and bone resorbing osteoclasts is crucial. In the present study brushite forming calcium phosphate cements (CPC) were doped with Co2+, Cu2+ and Cr3+ and the influence of these materials on osteoclast differentiation and activity was examined. Human osteoclasts were differentiated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) both on the surface and in indirect contact to the materials on dentin discs. Release of calcium, phosphate and bioactive metal ions was determined using ICP-MS both in the presence and absence of the cells. While Co2+ and Cu2+ showed a burst release, Cr3+ was released steadily at very low concentrations (below 1 μM) and both calcium and phosphate release of the cements was considerably changed in the Cr3+ modified samples. Direct cultivation of PBMC/osteoclasts on Co2+ cements showed lower attached cell number compared to the reference but high activity of osteoclast specific enzymes tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) and cathepsin K (CTSK) and significantly increased gene expression of vitronectin receptor. Indirect cultivation with diluted Co2+ cement extracts revealed highest resorbed area compared to all other modifications and the reference. Cu2+ cements had cytotoxic effect on PBMC/osteoclasts during direct cultivation, while indirect cultivation with diluted extracts from Cu2+ cements did not provoke cytotoxic effects but a strictly inhibited resorption. Cr3+ doped cements did not show cytotoxic effects at all. Gene expression and enzyme activity of CTSK was significantly increased in direct culture. Indirect cultivation with Cr3+ doped cements revealed significantly higher resorbed area compared to the reference. In conclusion Cr3+ doped calcium phosphate cements are an innovative cement modification because of their high cytocompatibility and support of active resorption by osteoclasts."
https://openalex.org/W2741280726,"To assess the changes in phosphodiester (PDE)-levels, detected by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), over 24-months to determine the potential of PDE as marker for muscle tissue changes in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) patients.Spatially resolved phosphorous datasets were acquired in the right lower leg of 18 DMD patients (range: 5-15.4 years) and 12 age-matched healthy controls (range: 5-14 years) at three time-points (baseline, 12-months, and 24-months) using a 7T MR-System (Philips Achieva). 3-point Dixon images were acquired at 3T (Philips Ingenia) to determine muscle fat fraction. Analyses were done for six muscles that represent different stages of muscle wasting. Differences between groups and time-points were assessed with non-parametric tests with correction for multiple comparisons. Coefficient of variance (CV) were determined for PDE in four healthy adult volunteers in high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) datasets.PDE-levels were significantly higher (two-fold) in DMD patients compared to controls in all analyzed muscles at almost every time point and did not change over the study period. Fat fraction was significantly elevated in all muscles at all time points compared to healthy controls, and increased significantly over time, except in the tibialis posterior muscle. The mean within subject CV for PDE-levels was 4.3% in datasets with high SNR (>10:1) and 5.7% in datasets with low SNR.The stable two-fold increase in PDE-levels found in DMD patients in muscles with different levels of muscle wasting over 2-year time, including DMD patients as young as 5.5 years-old, suggests that PDE-levels may increase very rapidly early in the disease process and remain elevated thereafter. The low CV values in high and low SNR datasets show that PDE-levels can be accurately and reproducibly quantified in all conditions. Our data confirms the great potential of PDE as a marker for muscle tissue changes in DMD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2741185117,"A remarkable property of the machinery for import of peroxisomal matrix proteins is that it can accept already folded proteins as substrates. This import involves binding of newly synthesized proteins by cytosolic peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5 (PEX5) followed by insertion of the PEX5–cargo complex into the peroxisomal membrane at the docking/translocation module (DTM). However, how these processes occur remains largely unknown. Here, we used truncated PEX5 molecules to probe the DTM architecture. We found that the DTM can accommodate a larger number of truncated PEX5 molecules comprising amino acid residues 1–197 than full-length PEX5 molecules. A shorter PEX5 version (PEX5(1–125)) still interacted correctly with the DTM; however, this species was largely accessible to exogenously added proteinase K, suggesting that this protease can access the DTM occupied by a small PEX5 protein. Interestingly, the PEX5(1–125)–DTM interaction was inhibited by a polypeptide comprising PEX5 residues 138–639. Apparently, the DTM can recruit soluble PEX5 through interactions with different PEX5 domains, suggesting that the PEX5–DTM interactions are to some degree fuzzy. Finally, we found that the interaction between PEX5 and PEX14, a major DTM component, is stable at pH 11.5. Thus, there is no reason to assume that the hitherto intriguing resistance of DTM-bound PEX5 to alkaline extraction reflects its direct contact with the peroxisomal lipid bilayer. Collectively, these results suggest that the DTM is best described as a large cavity-forming protein assembly into which cytosolic PEX5 can enter to release its cargo."
https://openalex.org/W2742076092,"Over the last few years, thalidomide has become one of the most important anti-tumour drugs for the treatment of relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma. However, besides its undesirable teratogenic side effect, its configurational instability critically limits any further therapeutic improvements of this drug. In 1999, we developed fluoro-thalidomide which is a bioisostere of thalidomide, but, in sharp contrast to the latter, it is configurationally stable and readily available in both enantiomeric forms. The biological activity of fluoro-thalidomide however, still remains virtually unstudied, with the exception that fluoro-thalidomide is not teratogenic. Herein, we report the first biological evaluation of fluoro-thalidomide in racemic and in both (R)- and (S)-enantiomerically pure forms against (in vitro) H929 cells of multiple myeloma (MM) using an annexin V assay. We demonstrate that all fluoro-thalidomides inhibited the growth of H929 MM cells without any in-vivo activation. Furthermore, we report that the enantiomeric forms of fluoro-thalidomide display different anti-tumour activities, with the (S)-enantiomer being noticeably more potent. The angiogenesis of fluoro-thalidomides is also investigated and compared to thalidomide. The data obtained in this study paves the way towards novel pharmaceutical research on fluoro-thalidomides."
https://openalex.org/W2740707595,"To investigate whether differences in muscle fiber types affect early-stage fat accumulation, under high fat diet challenge in mice.Twelve healthy male C57BL/6 mice experienced with short-term (6 weeks) diet treatment for the evaluation of early pattern changes in muscular fat. The mice were randomly divided into two groups: high fat diet (n = 8) and normal control diet (n = 4). Extra- and intra-myocellular lipid (EMCL and IMCL) in lumbar muscles (type I fiber predominant) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscle (type II fiber predominant) were determined using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Correlation of EMCL, IMCL and their ratio between TA and lumbar muscles was evaluated.EMCL increased greatly in both muscle types after high fat diet. IMCL in TA and lumbar muscles increased to a much lower extent, with a slightly greater increase in TA muscles. EMCLs in the 2 muscles were positively correlated (r = 0.84, p = 0.01), but IMCLs showed a negative relationship (r = -0.84, p = 0.01). In lumbar muscles, high fat diet significantly decreased type I fiber while it increased type II fiber (all p≤0.001). In TA muscle, there was no significant fiber type shifting (p>0.05).Under short-time high fat diet challenge, lipid tends to initially accumulate extra-cellularly. In addition, compared to type II dominant muscle, Type I dominant muscle was less susceptible to IMCL accumulation but more to fiber type shifting. These phenomena might reflect compensative responses of skeletal muscle to dietary lipid overload in order to regulate metabolic homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2741442463,"Since the late 1950's, a steadily increasing immigrant population in Germany is resulting in a subpopulation of aging immigrants. The German health care system needs to adjust its services-linguistically, culturally, and medically-for this subpopulation of patients. Immigrants make up over 20% of the population in Germany, yet the majority receive inadequate medical care. As many of the labor immigrants of the 1960s and 1970s are in need of hospice and palliative care (HPC), little is known about this specialized care for immigrants. This epidemiological study presents utilization of HPC facilities in Berlin with a focus on different immigrant groups.A validated questionnaire was used to collect data from patients at 34 HPC institutions in Berlin over 20 months. All newly admitted patients were recruited. Anonymized data were coded and analyzed by using SPSS and compared with the population statistics of Berlin.4118 questionnaires were completed and included in the analysis. At 11.4% the proportion of immigrants accessing HPC was significantly (p<0,001) below their proportion in the general Berlin population. This difference was especially seen in the age groups of 51-60 (21.46% immigrants in Berlin population, 17.7% immigrants in HPC population) and 61-70 years (16,9% vs. 13,1%). The largest ethnic groups are Turks, Russians, and Poles, with a different weighting than in the general population: Turkish immigrants were 24% of all Berlin immigrants, but only 13.6% of the study immigrant population (OR: 0.23, 95%CI: 0.18-0.29, p<0.001). Russian and Polish immigrants account for 5.6% and 9.2% in the population, but 11.5% and 24.8% in the study population respectively (Russian: OR 0.88, 95%CI: 0.66-1.16; Polish: OR 1.17, 95%CI: 0.97-1.42). Palliative care wards (PC) were used most often (16.7% immigrants of all PC patients); outpatient hospice services were used least often by immigrants (11.4%). Median age at first admission to HPC was younger in immigrants than non-immigrants: 61-70 vs. 71-80, p = 0.03.Immigrants are underrepresented in Berlin´s HPC and immigrants on average make use of care at a younger age than non-immigrants. In this regard, Turkish immigrants in particular have the poorest utilization of HPC. These results should prompt research on Turkish immigrants, regarding access barriers, since they represent the largest immigrant group. This may be due to a lack of cultural sensitivity of the care-providers and a lack of knowledge about HPC among immigrants. In the comparison of the kinds of institutions, immigrants are less likely to access outpatient hospice services compared to PC. Apparently, PC appear to be a smaller hurdle for utilization. These results show a non-existent, but oft-cited ""healthy immigrant effect"" of the first generation of work immigrants, now entering old age. These findings correspond with studies suggesting increased health concerns in immigrants. Focused research is needed to promote efforts in providing adequate and fair access to HPC for all people in Berlin."
https://openalex.org/W2739728147,"Microglial cell precursors located in the area of the base of the pecten and the optic nerve head (BP/ONH) start to enter the retina of quail embryos at the 7th day of incubation (E7), subsequently colonizing the entire retina by central-to-peripheral tangential migration, as previously shown by our group. The present study demonstrates a precise chronological coincidence of the onset of microglial cell entry into the retina with a striking increase in death of retinal cells, as revealed by their active caspase-3 expression and TUNEL staining, in regions dorsal to the BP/ONH area, suggesting that dying retinal cells would contribute to the microglial cell inflow into the retina. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this inflow are currently unclear. Extracellular nucleotides, such as ATP and UDP, have previously been shown to favor migration of microglia towards brain injuries because they are released by apoptotic cells and stimulate both chemotaxis and chemokinesis in microglial cells via signaling through purinergic receptors. Hence, we tested here the hypothesis that ATP and UDP play a role in the entry and migration of microglial precursors into the developing retina. For this purpose, we used an experimental model system based on organotypic cultures of E6.5 quail embryo retina explants, which mimics the entry and migration of microglial precursors in the in situ developing retina. Inhibition of purinergic signaling by treating retina explants with either apyrase, a nucleotide-hydrolyzing enzyme, or suramin, a broad spectrum antagonist of purinergic receptors, significantly prevents the entry of microglial cells into the retina. In addition, treatment of retina explants with either exogenous ATP or UDP results in significantly increased numbers of microglial cells entering the retina. In light of these findings, we conclude that purinergic signaling by extracellular ATP and UDP is necessary for the entry and migration of microglial cells into the embryonic retina by inducing chemokinesis in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2740717909,"Biliary atresia is progressive fibro-inflammatory cholangiopathy of young children. Central to pathogenic mechanisms of injury is the tissue targeting by the innate and adaptive immune cells. Among these cells, neutrophils and the IL-8/Cxcl-8 signaling via its Cxcr2 receptor have been linked to bile duct injury. Here, we aimed to investigate whether the intestinal microbiome modulates Cxcr2-dependent bile duct injury and obstruction. Adult wild-type (WT) and Cxcr2-/- mice were fed a diet supplemented with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMZ/TMP) during pregnancy and lactation, and their pups were injected intraperitoneally with rhesus rotavirus (RRV) within 24 hours of life to induce experimental biliary atresia. The maternal exposure to SMZ/TMP significantly lowered the incidence of jaundice and bile duct obstruction and resulted in improved survival, especially in Cxcr2-/- mice. Analyses of the microbiome by deep sequencing of 16S rRNA of the neonatal colon showed a delay in bacterial colonization of WT mice induced by SMZ/TMP, with a notable switch from Proteobacteria to Firmicutes. Interestingly, the genetic inactivation of Cxcr2 alone produced a similar bacterial shift. When treated with SMZ/TMP, Cxcr2-/- mice infected with RRV to induce experimental biliary atresia showed further enrichment of Corynebacterium, Anaerococcus and Streptococcus. Among these, Anaerococcus lactolyticus was significantly associated with a suppression of biliary injury, cholestasis, and survivability. These results suggest that the postnatal development of the intestinal microbiota is an important susceptibility factor for experimental biliary atresia."

H2O2 treated H9c2 cells recorded cytotoxicity (48–50%) and apoptosis (57.3%), the same were reduced in presence of ARCE (7–10% & 12.3% respectively). Rats pretreated with ARCE for 30 days followed by ISO treatment recorded favourable heart: body weight ratio as compared to ISO treated group. Also, the mRNA levels of enzymatic antioxidants (sod and catalase) and apoptotic genes (bax and bcl-2) in ARCE+ISO treated group were similar to the control group suggesting that ARCE pretreatment prevents ISO induced depletion of enzymatic antioxidants and apoptosis. Histoarchitecture of ventricular tissue of ISO treated group was marked by infracted areas (10%) and derangement of myocardium whereas, ARCE+ISO treated group (4.5%) recorded results comparable to control (0%). ARCE+ISO treated group accounted for upregulation of caveolin-3 and SERCA2a expression as compared to the ISO treated group implying towards ARCE mediated reduction in membrane damage and calcium imbalance. Molecular docking scores and LigPlot analysis of cyanidin-3-glucoside (-8.7 Kcal/mol) and delphinidin-3-glucoside (-8.5 Kcal/mol) showed stable hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with β1 adrenergic receptor. Overall this study elucidates the mechanism of ARCE mediated prevention of experimentally induced myocardial damage."
https://openalex.org/W2740731509,"We present a DNA barcoding study of Neotropical odonates from the Upper Plata basin, Brazil. A total of 38 species were collected in a transition region of “Cerrado” and Atlantic Forest, both regarded as biological hotspots, and 130 cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcodes were generated for the collected specimens. The distinct gap between intraspecific (0–2%) and interspecific variation (15% and above) in COI, and resulting separation of Barcode Index Numbers (BIN), allowed for successful identification of specimens in 94% of cases. The 6% fail rate was due to a shared BIN between two separate nominal species. DNA barcoding, based on COI, thus seems to be a reliable and efficient tool for identifying Neotropical odonate specimens down to the species level. These results underscore the utility of DNA barcoding to aid specimen identification in diverse biological hotspots, areas that require urgent action regarding taxonomic surveys and biodiversity conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2741016472,"The Neacomys genus (Rodentia, Sigmodontinae) is distributed in the Amazon region, with some species limited to a single endemic area, while others may occur more widely. The number of species within the genus and their geographical boundaries are not known accurately, due to their high genetic diversity and difficulties in taxonomic identification. In this work we collected Neacomys specimens from both banks of the Tapajós River in eastern Amazon, and studied them using chromosome painting with whole chromosome probes of Hylaeamys megacephalus (HME; Rodentia, Sigmodontinae), and molecular analysis using haplotypes of mitochondrial genes COI and Cytb. Chromosome painting shows that Neacomys sp. A (NSP-A, 2n = 58/FN = 68) and Neacomys sp. B (NSP-B, 2n = 54/FN = 66) differ by 11 fusion/fission events, one translocation, four pericentric inversions and four heterochromatin amplification events. Using haplotypes of the concatenated mitochondrial genes COI and Cyt b, Neacomys sp. (2n = 58/FN = 64 and 70) shows a mean divergence of 6.2% for Neacomys sp. A and 9.1% for Neacomys sp. B, while Neacomys sp. A and Neacomys sp. B presents a medium nucleotide divergence of 7.4%. Comparisons were made with other published Neacomys data. The Tapajós and Xingu Rivers act as geographic barriers that define the distribution of these Neacomys species. Furthermore, our HME probes reveal four synapomorphies for the Neacomys genus (associations HME 20/[13,22]/4, 6a/21, [9,10]/7b/[9,10] and 12/[16,17]) and demonstrate ancestral traits of the Oryzomyini tribe (HME 8a and 8b, 18 and 25) and Sigmodontinae subfamily (HME 15 and 24), which can be used as taxonomic markers for these groups."
https://openalex.org/W2741849187,"Tumor cell extravasation is a multistep process preceded by cell rolling and arrest on the vessel wall via the formation of specific receptor–ligand bonds. The strength, availability, and number of receptor–ligand bonds regulate the rate by which tumor cells tether, roll, and adhere to vascular walls. Although the mechanics of selectin-mediated rolling have been extensively studied, little is known regarding how tumor cell rolling on selectins facilitates adhesion to a distinct substrate-bound protein with different kinetic properties. By using multicomponent protein patterning and a microfluidic system, we evaluated how E-selectin-dependent rolling modulates hyaluronic acid (HA) adhesion as a function of fluid shear, contact time, and the spacing between E-selectin and HA regions patterned on the substrate. We show that tumor cells rolling on E-selectin were ~40-fold more likely to bind to HA than nonrolling cells in shear flow. Furthermore, E-selectin-dependent rolling promotes adhesion to HA by both physically slowing cells and enabling them to position proximal to the surface, thereby increasing the on rate of adhesion. A better understanding of tumor cell adhesion under physiologic shear would lead to the development of new diagnostic assays and pave the way to clinical approaches aimed ultimately to halt metastasis.—Shea, D.

https://openalex.org/W2739674096,"This paper presents a method for formation flight and collision avoidance of multiple UAVs. Due to the shortcomings such as collision avoidance caused by UAV’s high-speed and unstructured environments, this paper proposes a modified tentacle algorithm to ensure the high performance of collision avoidance. Different from the conventional tentacle algorithm which uses inverse derivation, the modified tentacle algorithm rapidly matches the radius of each tentacle and the steering command, ensuring that the data calculation problem in the conventional tentacle algorithm is solved. Meanwhile, both the speed sets and tentacles in one speed set are reduced and reconstructed so as to be applied to multiple UAVs. Instead of path iterative optimization, the paper selects the best tentacle to obtain the UAV collision avoidance path quickly. The simulation results show that the method presented in the paper effectively enhances the performance of flight formation and collision avoidance for multiple high-speed UAVs in unstructured environments."
https://openalex.org/W2739581227,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is an aggressive form of pancreatic cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death. When possible, curative approaches are based on surgical resection, though not every patient is a candidate for surgery. There are clinical guidelines for the management of these patients that offer different treatment options depending on the clinical and pathologic characteristics. However, the survival rates seen in this kind of patients are still low. The CDSE1 gene is located upstream of NRAS and encodes an RNA-binding protein termed UNR. The aim of this study was to analyze UNR expression and its correlation with outcome in patients with resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). For this, samples from resectable PDAC patients who underwent duodenopancreatectomy were used to evaluate UNR protein expression by immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray. Here, we observed that low UNR expression was significantly associated with shorter progression-free survival after surgery (P = 0.010). Moreover, this prognostic marker remained significant after Cox proportional hazards model (P = 0.036). We further studied the role of CDSE1 expression in patient’s prognosis using data from public repositories (GEO and TGCA), confirming our results. Interestingly, CDSE1 expression correlated with that of genes characteristic of an immunogenic molecular subtype of pancreatic cancer. Based on these findings, UNR may be considered a potential prognostic biomarker for resectable PDAC and may serve to guide subsequent adjuvant treatment decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2739673397,"Purpose The present study aims to identify the risk factors for adverse drug reactions (ADR) in pediatric inpatients. Methods A prospective cohort study in one general pediatric ward in a hospital in Northeast Brazil was conducted in two stages: the first stage was conducted between August 17th and November 6th, 2015, and the second one between March 1st and August 25th, 2016. We included children aged 0–14 years 11 months hospitalized with a minimum stay of 48 hours. Observed outcomes were the ADR occurrence and the time until the first ADR observed. In the univariate analysis, the time to the first ADR was compared among groups using a log-rank test. For the multivariate analysis, the Cox regression model was used. Results A total of 173 children (208 admissions) and 66 ADR classified as “definite” and “probable” were identified. The incidence rate was 3/100 patient days. The gastro-intestinal system disorders were the main ADR observed (28.8%). In addition, 22.7% of the ADR were related to antibacterials for systemic use and 15.2% to general anesthesia. Prior history of ADR of the child [hazard ratio (HR) 2.44; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19–5.00], the use of meglumine antimonate (HR 4.98; 95% CI 1.21–20.54), antibacterial for systemic use (HR 2.75; 95% CI 1.08–6.98) and antiepileptic drugs (HR 3.84; 95% CI 1.40–10.56) were identified risk factors for ADR. Conclusions We identified as risk factors the prior history of ADR of the child and the use of meglumine antimonate, antibacterial for systemic use and antiepileptic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2741561300,"We assessed changes in phylogenetic diversity of angiosperm flora on six oceanic islands located in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, by comparing flora from two periods: the pre-European colonization of islands and current times. We hypothesize that, in the time between these periods, extinction of local plant species and addition of exotic plants modified phylogenetic-α-diversity at different levels (deeper and terminal phylogeny) and increased phylo-β-diversity among islands. Based on floristic studies, we assembled a phylogenetic tree from occurrence data that includes 921 species, of which 165 and 756 were native or exotic in origin, respectively. Then, we studied change in the phylo-α-diversity and phylo-β-diversity (1 –Phylosor) by comparing pre-European and current times. Despite extinction of 18 native angiosperm species, an increase in species richness and phylo-α-diversity was observed for all islands studied, attributed to introduction of exotic plants (between 6 to 477 species per island). We did not observe significant variation of mean phylogenetic distance (MPD), a measure of the ‘deeper’ phylogenetic diversity of assemblages (e.g., orders, families), suggesting that neither extinctions nor introductions altered phylogenetic structure of the angiosperms of these islands. In regard to phylo-β-diversity, we detected temporal turnover (variation in phylogenetic composition) between periods to flora (0.38 ± 0.11). However, when analyses were performed only considering native plants, we did not observe significant temporal turnover between periods (0.07 ± 0.06). These results indicate that introduction of exotic angiosperms has contributed more notably than extinctions to the configuration of plant assemblages and phylogenetic diversity on the studied islands. Because phylogenetic diversity is closely related to functional diversity (species trait variations and roles performed by organisms), our results suggests that the introduction of exotic plants to these islands could have detrimental impacts for ecosystem functions and ecosystem services that islands provide (e.g. productivity)."

We used a Cox regression for multivariate analysis to investigate the influence of the following on seizure recurrence: receiving more than one type of AED (HR = 2.53, 95% CI 1.24-5.16) and more than 6 months prior to initiation of AED treatment (HR 1.47, 95% CI = 1.004-2.15).Although the decision to discontinue AED treatment necessitates an individual evaluation of each patient, our study suggests that there may be a high risk of recurrence in individuals who: were receiving more than one AEDs and had initiated their AED treatment more than 6 months after the initial appearance of epilepsy symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2741252024,"Alpine marmots Marmota marmota occupy a narrow altitudinal niche within high elevation alpine environments. For animals living at such high elevations where resources are limited, parasitism represents a potential major cost in life history. Using occupancy models, we tested if marmots living at higher elevation have a reduced risk of being infected with gastro-intestinal helminths, possibly compensating the lower availability of resources (shorter feeding season, longer snow cover and lower temperature) than marmots inhabiting lower elevations. Detection probability of eggs and oncospheres of two gastro-intestinal helminthic parasites, Ascaris laevis and Ctenotaenia marmotae, sampled in marmot feces, was used as a proxy of parasite abundance. As predicted, the models showed a negative relationship between elevation and parasite detectability (i.e. abundance) for both species, while there appeared to be a negative effect of solar radiance only for C. marmotae. Site-occupancy models are used here for the first time to model the constrains of gastrointestinal parasitism on a wild species and the relationship existing between endoparasites and environmental factors in a population of free-living animals. The results of this study suggest the future use of site-occupancy models as a viable tool to account for parasite imperfect detection in eco-parasitological studies, and give useful insights to further investigate the hypothesis of the contribution of parasite infection in constraining the altitudinal niche of Alpine marmots."

Routinely collected national data allow use of quasi-experimental designs such as interrupted time series (ITS). Rwanda has invested in a robust electronic health management information system (HMIS) that captures monthly healthcare utilization data. We used ITS to evaluate impact of an HSS intervention to improve primary health care facility readiness on health service utilization in two rural districts of Rwanda.We used controlled ITS analysis to compare changes in healthcare utilization at health centers (HC) that received the intervention (n = 13) to propensity score matched non-intervention health centers in Rwanda (n = 86) from January 2008 to December 2012. HC support included infrastructure renovation, salary support, medical equipment, referral network strengthening, and clinical training. Baseline quarterly mean outpatient visit rates and population density were used to model propensity scores. The intervention began in May 2010 and was implemented over a twelve-month period. We used monthly healthcare utilization data from the national Rwandan HMIS to study changes in the (1) number of facility deliveries per 10,000 women, (2) number of referrals for high risk pregnancy per 100,000 women, and (3) the number of outpatient visits performed per 1,000 catchment population.PHIT HC experienced significantly higher monthly delivery rates post-HSS during the April-June season than comparison (3.19/10,000, 95% CI: [0.27, 6.10]). In 2010, this represented a 13% relative increase, and in 2011, this represented a 23% relative increase. The post-HSS change in monthly rate of high-risk pregnancies referred increased slightly in intervention compared to control HC (0.03/10,000, 95% CI: [-0.007, 0.06]). There was a small immediate post-HSS increase in outpatient visit rates in intervention compared to control HC (6.64/1,000, 95% CI: [-13.52, 26.81]).We failed to find strong evidence of post-HSS increases in outpatient visit rates or referral rates at health centers, which could be explained by small sample size and high baseline nation-wide health service coverage. However, our findings demonstrate that high quality routinely collected health facility data combined with ITS can be used for rigorous policy evaluation in resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W2741662754,"Disrupted circadian rhythms are a core feature of mood and anxiety disorders. Circadian rhythms are coordinated by a light-entrainable master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Animal models of mood and anxiety disorders often exhibit blunted rhythms in locomotor activity and clock gene expression. Interestingly, the changes in circadian rhythms correlate with mood-related behaviours. Although animal models of depression and anxiety exhibit aberrant circadian rhythms in physiology and behavior, it is possible that the methodology being used to induce the behavioral phenotype (e.g., brain lesions, chronic stress, global gene deletion) affect behavior independently of circadian system. This study investigates the relationship between individual differences in circadian locomotor parameters and mood-related behaviors in healthy rats. The circadian phenotype of male Lewis rats was characterized by analyzing wheel running behavior under standard 12h:12h LD conditions, constant dark, constant light, and rate of re-entrainment to a phase advance. Rats were then tested on a battery of behavioral tests: activity box, restricted feeding, elevated plus maze, forced swim test, and fear conditioning. Under 12h:12h LD conditions, percent of daily activity in the light phase and variability in activity onset were associated with longer latency to immobility in the forced swim test. Variability in onset also correlated positively with anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze. Rate of re-entrainment correlated positively with measures of anxiety in the activity box and elevated plus maze. Lastly, we found that free running period under constant dark was associated with anxiety-like behaviors in the activity box and elevated plus maze. Our results provide a previously uncharacterized relationship between circadian locomotor parameters and mood-related behaviors in healthy rats and provide a basis for future examination into circadian clock functioning and mood."

Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) control gene expression in many regulatory circuits in bacteria. The aim of the present work was to provide a global description of the sRNAs produced both by planktonic and biofilm-associated (sessile) cells of A. baumannii ATCC 17978, and to compare the corresponding gene expression profiles to identify sRNAs molecules associated to biofilm formation and virulence. sRNA was extracted from both planktonic and sessile cells and reverse transcribed. cDNA was subjected to 454-pyrosequencing using the GS-FLX Titanium chemistry. The global analysis of the small RNA transcriptome revealed different sRNA expression patterns in planktonic and biofilm associated cells, with some of the transcripts only expressed or repressed in sessile bacteria. A total of 255 sRNAs were detected, with 185 of them differentially expressed in the different types of cells. A total of 9 sRNAs were expressed only in biofilm cells, while the expression of other 21 coding regions were repressed only in biofilm cells. Strikingly, the expression level of the sRNA 13573 was 120 times higher in biofilms than in planktonic cells, an observation that prompted us to further investigate the biological role of this non-coding transcript. Analyses of an isogenic mutant and over-expressing strains revealed that the sRNA 13573 gene is involved in biofilm formation and attachment to A549 human alveolar epithelial cells. The present work serves as a basis for future studies examining the complex regulatory network that regulate biofilm biogenesis and attachment to eukaryotic cells in A. baumannii ATCC 17978."

We stratified using hierarchical categories of gay, bisexual, and other MSM to compare proportions in the military and general population. Results We found that 4.23% of men self-reported as gay, bisexual, or other MSM among men who served in the military, compared to 4.14% among men who had not served (p = 0.93). When stratified, we found that 0.78% self-reported as gay among men who served in the military, compared to 2.12% among men who had not served (p<0.001). Conclusions The proportion of men who identified as a gay was lower in the military than in the general population.

https://openalex.org/W2739549916,"Climatic change-induced water stress has been found to threaten the viability of trees, especially endangered species, through inhibiting their recruitment. Nyssa yunnanensis, a plant species with extremely small populations (PSESP), consists of only two small populations of eight mature individuals remaining in southwestern China. In order to determine the barriers to regeneration, both in situ and laboratory experiments were performed to examine the critical factors hindering seed germination and seedling establishment. The results of in situ field experiments demonstrated that soil water potentials lower than -5.40 MPa (experienced in December) had significantly inhibitory effects on seedling survival, and all seedlings perished at a soil water potential of -5.60 MPa (January). Laboratory experiments verified that N. yunnanensis seedlings could not survive at a 20% PEG 6000 concentration (-5.34 MPa) or 1/5 water-holding capacity (WHC; -5.64 MPa), and seed germination was inhibited in the field from September (-1.10 MPa) to November (-4.30 MPa). Our results suggested that soil water potentials between -5.34 and -5.64 MPa constituted the range of soil water potentials in which N. yunnanensis seedlings could not survive. In addition to water deficit, intensified autotoxicity, which is concentration-dependent, resulted in lower seed germination and seedling survival. Thus, seed establishment was probably simultaneously impacted by water deficit and aggravated autotoxicity. Meteorological records from the natural distribution areas of N. yunnanensis indicated that mean annual rainfall and relative humidity have declined by 21.7% and 6.3% respectively over past 55 years, while the temperature has increased by 6.0%. Climate change-induced drought, along with a poor resistance and adaptability to drought stress, has severely impacted the natural regeneration of N. yunnanensis. In conclusion, climate change-induced drought has been implicated as a regulating factor in the natural regeneration of N. yunnanensis through suppressing seed germination and screening out seedlings in the dry season. Based on the experimental findings, habitat restoration and microclimate improvement should both be highlighted in the conservation of this particular plant species."
https://openalex.org/W2740266202,"This study aimed to explore the role of telomeric repeat–containing RNA (TERRA) in telomeric chromatin remodeling during the early expansion of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). During the derivation of hESCs, histone demethylation in the telomeric region facilitates telomerase-mediated telomere elongation. An adequate telomere repeat is essential for hESCs to acquire and/or maintain the unlimited symmetric division, which suggests that there is a link between pluripotency and telomere maintenance. The present study found that the gradual decrease in TERRA levels and related TERRA foci were correlated with telomeric length elongation in the early expansion of hESCs. In addition, TERRA participated in telomeric chromatin remodeling by cooperating with SUV39H1 (suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1/2) to propagate telomeric heterochromatin marker, histone H3 trimethylation of lysine 9. Moreover, the fibroblast growth factor signaling pathway, which is activated in hESCs, could suppress TERRA levels via telomeric repeat factor 1, which results in reduced SUV39H1 recruitment by TERRA at the telomere. Taken together, these results highlight the role of TERRA in hESC telomere elongation and homeostasis in the acquisition and/or maintenance of stem cell pluripotency.—Zeng, S., Liu, L., Sun, Y., Lu, G., Lin, G.

The aim of this study was to diagnose periportal fibrosis due to schistosomiasis mansoni in patients with chronic HBV or HCV infection through NMR-based metabonomics models.The study included 40 patients divided into two groups: (i) 18 coinfected patients with schistosomiasis mansoni and HBV or HCV; and (ii) 22 HBV or HCV monoinfected patients. The serum samples were analyzed through H-1 NMR spectroscopy and the models were based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). Ultrasonography examination was used to ascertain the diagnosis of periportal fibrosis. Exploratory analysis showed a clear separation between coinfected and monoinfected samples. The supervised model built from PLS-DA showed accuracy, R2 and Q2 values equal to 100%, 98.1% and 97.5%, respectively. According to the variable importance in the projection plot, lactate serum levels were higher in the coinfected group, while the signals attributed to HDL serum cholesterol were more intense in the monoinfected group.The metabonomics models constructed in this study are promising as an alternative tool for diagnosis of periportal fibrosis by schistosomiasis in patients with chronic HBV or HCV infection from endemic areas for Schistosoma mansoni."
https://openalex.org/W2741741440,"Numerical approaches to high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data are often employed independently to address individual questions. We linked independent approaches in a bioinformatics pipeline for further insight. The pipeline driven by heterozygosity and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) analyses was applied to characterize Bos taurus and Bos indicus ancestry. We infer a gene co-heterozygosity network that regulates bovine fertility, from data on 18,363 cattle with genotypes for 729,068 SNP. Hierarchical clustering separated populations according to Bos taurus and Bos indicus ancestry. The weights of the first principal component were subjected to Normal mixture modelling allowing the estimation of a gene's contribution to the Bos taurus-Bos indicus axis. We used deviation from HWE, contribution to Bos indicus content and association to fertility traits to select 1,284 genes. With this set, we developed a co-heterozygosity network where the group of genes annotated as fertility-related had significantly higher Bos indicus content compared to other functional classes of genes, while the group of genes associated with milk production had significantly higher Bos taurus content. The network analysis resulted in capturing novel gene associations of relevance to bovine domestication events. We report transcription factors that are likely to regulate genes associated with cattle domestication and tropical adaptation. Our pipeline can be generalized to any scenarios where population structure requires scrutiny at the molecular level, particularly in the presence of a priori set of genes known to impact a phenotype of evolutionary interest such as fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2741870531,The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of MCPyV in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) primaries versus lymph node metastasis and to evaluate possible prognostic factors.Samples of MCC primaries and lymph node metastases were stained immunohistochemically for the MCPyV large T-antigen and expression was compared to patients´ clinical outcome.41 MCC patients were included. 33 (61%) out of 54 specimens were MCPyV-positive in the immunohistochemistry. 15 (47%) out of 32 primary tumors were positive compared to 18 (82%) out of 22 lymph node metastases. Eleven patients with positive polyomavirus expression died from the carcinoma compared to 4 patients without virus expression. Cox regression analysis showed worse disease-free survival in patients with MCPyV compared to virus-negative lymph nodes (p = 0.002).To our knowledge this is the first study to describe a negative prognostic effect of the MCPyV expression in lymph node metastasis in MCC patients.
https://openalex.org/W2741450527,"We performed an analysis of possible mechanisms of ligand recognition in the human nose. The analysis is based on in vivo odor threshold determination and in vitro Ca2+ imaging assays with a C/Si/Ge/Sn switch strategy applied to the compounds Lilial and Bourgeonal, to differentiate between different molecular mechanisms of odorant detection. Our results suggest that odorant detection under threshold conditions is mainly based on the molecular shape, i.e. the van der Waals surface, and electrostatics of the odorants. Furthermore, we show that a single olfactory receptor type is responsible for odor detection of Bourgeonal at the threshold level in humans in vivo. Carrying out a QM analysis of vibrational energies contained in the odorants, there is no evidence for a vibration-based recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2740130936,"Angiogenesis, the sprouting of new blood vessels from existing vasculature, involves multiple complex biological processes, and it is an essential step for hemostasis, tissue healing and regeneration. Angiogenesis stimulants can ameliorate human disease conditions including limb ischemia, chronic wounds, heart disease, and stroke. The current strategies to improve the bioavailability of pro-angiogenic growth factors, including VEGF and FGF2, have remained largely unsuccessful. This study demonstrates that small molecules, termed click-xylosides, can promote angiogenesis in the in vitro matrigel tube formation assay and the ex ovo chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, depending on their aglycone moieties. Xyloside treatment enhances network connectivity and cell survivability, thereby, maintaining the network structures on matrigel culture for an extended period of time. These effects were achieved via the secreted xyloside-primed glycosaminoglycans (GAG) chains that in part, act through an ERK1/2 mediated signaling pathway. Through the remodeling of GAGs in the extracellular matrix of endothelial cells, the glycan approach, involving xylosides, offers great potential to effectively promote therapeutic angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2740662362,"Cytosine deamination induced by stresses or enzymatic catalysis converts deoxycytidine into deoxyuridine, thereby introducing a G to A mutation after DNA replication. Base-excision repair to correct uracil to cytosine is initiated by uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG), which recognizes and eliminates uracil from DNA. Mimivirus, one of the largest known viruses, also encodes a distinctive UDG gene containing a long N-terminal domain (N-domain; residues 1-130) and a motif-I (residues 327-343), in addition to the canonical catalytic domain of family I UDGs (also called UNGs). To understand the structural and functional features of the additional segments, we have determined the crystal structure of UNG from Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (mvUNG). In the crystal structure of mvUNG, residues 95-130 in the N-domain bind to a hydrophobic groove in the catalytic domain, and motif-I forms a short β-sheet with a positively charged surface near the active site. Circular dichroism spectra showed that residues 1-94 are in a random coil conformation. Deletion of the three additional fragments reduced the activity and thermal stability, compared to full-length mvUNG. The results suggested that the mvUNG N-domain and motif-I are required for its structural and functional integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2739906579,"In agricultural production, land-use decisions are components of economic planning that result in the strategic allocation of fields. Climate variability represents an uncertainty factor in crop production. Considering yield impact, climatic influence is perceived during and evaluated at the end of crop production cycles. In practice, this information is then incorporated into planning for the upcoming season. This process contributes to attitudes toward climate-induced risk in crop production. In the literature, however, the subjective valuation of risk is modeled as a risk attitude toward variations in (monetary) outcomes. Consequently, climatic influence may be obscured by political and market influences so that risk perceptions during the production process are neglected. We present a utility concept that allows the inclusion of annual risk scores based on mid-season risk perceptions that are incorporated into field-planning decisions. This approach is exemplified and implemented for winter wheat production in the Kraichgau, a region in Southwest Germany, using the integrated bio-economic simulation model FarmActor and empirical data from the region. Survey results indicate that a profitability threshold for this crop, the level of “still-good yield” (sgy), is 69 dt ha-1 (regional mean Kraichgau sample) for a given season. This threshold governs the monitoring process and risk estimators. We tested the modeled estimators against simulation results using ten projected future weather time series for winter wheat production. The mid-season estimators generally proved to be effective. This approach can be used to improve the modeling of planning decisions by providing a more comprehensive evaluation of field-crop response to climatic changes from an economic risk point of view. The methodology further provides economic insight in an agrometeorological context where prices for crops or inputs are lacking, but farmer attitudes toward risk should still be included in the analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2741063492,"Regional co-location scoping intends to identify local regions where spatial features of interest are frequently located together. Most of the previous researches in this domain are conducted on a global scale and they assume that spatial objects are embedded in a 2-D space, but the movement in urban space is actually constrained by the street network. In this paper we refine the scope of co-location patterns to 1-D paths consisting of nodes and segments. Furthermore, since the relations between spatial events are usually inversely proportional to their separation distance, the proposed method introduces the “Distance Decay Effects” to improve the result. Specifically, our approach first subdivides the street edges into continuous small linear segments. Then a value representing the local distribution intensity of events is estimated for each linear segment using the distance-decay function. Each kind of geographic feature can lead to a tessellated network with density attribute, and the generated multiple networks for the pattern of interest will be finally combined into a composite network by calculating the co-location prevalence measure values, which are based on the density variation between different features. Our experiments verify that the proposed approach is effective in urban analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2740288297,"Background/Aim In the colorectum, lymphoid follicles hyperplasia (LH) is sometimes observed as small, round, yellowish-white nodules. The novel image-enhanced endoscopy system named blue laser imaging (BLI) provides enhanced the contrast of surface vessels using lasers for light illumination. We investigated the endoscopic features of LH observed by using BLI endoscopy and its association with chronic bowel symptoms. Patients/Methods 300 participants undergoing colonoscopy for various indications were enrolled. Entire colorectum was observed by using BLI-bright mode with non-magnification view. LH was defined as well demarcated white nodules. Elevated LH with erythema was distinguished as LH severe. Results LHs were observed more clearly by using BLI-bright mode compared to conventional white light colonoscopy and were also histologically confirmed as intense infiltration of lymphocytes or plasmacytes. LH was observed in 134 subjects (44.6%) and 67 (22.3%) were LH severe. LH was associated younger age (Odds ratio (OR) = 1.05, 95%Confidence Interval (95%CI) = 1.03–1.07, P<0.0001) and chronic bowel symptoms including constipation, hard stools, diarrhea and loose stools (all LH: OR = 4.03, 95%CI = 2.36–6.89, P<0.0001, LH severe: OR = 5.31, 95%CI = 2.64–10.71, P<0.0001). LH severe was closely associated with both constipation associated symptoms (OR = 3.94, 95%CI = 1.79–8.66, P = 0.0007) and diarrhea associated symptoms (OR = 5.22, 95%CI = 2.09–13.05, P = 0.0004). In particular, LH severe in the ascending colon was strongly associated with bowel symptoms (P<0.0001). Conclusion LH, visualized by using BLI endoscopy was associated with bowel symptom, raising the possibility of pathogenic role of this endoscopic finding in the functional lower gastrointestinal disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2741280065,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α antibody (Ab) on alteration of penile structure in the hyperprolactinemia (hyperPRL) rat model. HyperPRL was induced in 8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats by allografting anterior pituitary (AP) glands under the renal capsule (+AP rats). Rats implanted with cerebral cortex (CX) were used as sham control (+CX rats). At 6 weeks post implantation, rats received either a single intra-testicular dose of TNF-α Ab (12.5 μg/kg) or testosterone replacement (2 doses of testosterone enanthate [TE], 3 mg/kg), and they were sacrificed 1 week later. Blood and penile tissue was collected for analysis. Compared to +CX rats, the +AP group had lower serum testosterone concentration and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expression, but exhibited a higher ratio of collagen III/I in the corpus cavernosum. Smooth muscle content exhibited no significant changes. At 1 week post TNF-α Ab injection, the collagen III/I ratio in the +AP group was decreased, and the smooth muscle content and nNOS expression increased significantly. These findings were comparable to those observed in +AP rats receiving TE. Testicular TNF-α suppresses testosterone release, which in turn results in the erectile dysfunction (ED) seen in hyperPRL. Intra-testicular TNF-α Ab treatment is as effective as testosterone supplementation on penile structure normalization in the hyperPRL model."
https://openalex.org/W2741900614,"The non-criteria neuropsychiatric manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome include headache, dizziness, vertigo, seizure, depression and psychosis. There were still no objective methods qualified to detect the early central nervous system involvement in non-criteria antiphospholipid syndrome. We evaluated the effectiveness of Tc-99m ECD SPECT in assessing circulatory insufficiency in the brains of patients with antiphospholipid antibodies and neuropsychiatric symptoms but without thromboembolism.Patients with a history of positive antiphospholipid antibodies and neuropsychiatric symptoms composed the case group; patients without antiphospholipid antibody served as the control group. Subjects with a history of thromboembolism or autoantibodies to extractable nuclear antigens were excluded. All patients received Tc-99m ECD SPECT studies and were classified by the number of positive antiphospholipid antibodies they carried. The heterogeneity of brain perfusion was defined as the coefficient of variation of the SPECT signals. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to evaluate the differences between the groups.Total 60 adult patients were included in this study. There were 54 patients in the case group and 6 patients in the control group. The mean age was 38.3 ± 11.5 years. There were 52 women and 8 men. There was no significant difference in the mean brain perfusion between groups (P = 0.69). However, Tc-99m ECD SPECT demonstrated significant heterogeneity of brain perfusion in relation to the number of antiphospholipid antibodies (P = 0.01).This is the first study demonstrating that Tc-99m ECD SPECT can early detect the increased heterogeneity of brain circulation in non-criteria antiphospholipid antibody carriers."
https://openalex.org/W2739727973,"The freshwater dinoflagellate Nusuttodinium aeruginosum lacks permanent chloroplasts. Rather it sequesters chloroplasts as well as other cell organelles, like mitochondria and nuclei, from ingested cryptophyte prey. In the present study, growth rates, cell production and photosynthesis were measured at seven irradiances, ranging from 10 to 140 μmol photons m-2s-1, when fed the cryptophyte Chroomonas sp. Growth rates were positively influenced by irradiance and increased from 0.025 d-1 at 10 μmol photons m-2s-1 to maximum growth rates of ~0.3 d-1 at irradiances ≥ 40 μmol photons m-2s-1. Similarly, photosynthesis ranged from 1.84 to 36.9 pg C cell-1 h-1 at 10 and 140 μmol photons m-2s-1, respectively. The highest rates of photosynthesis in N. aeruginosum only corresponded to ~25% of its own cell carbon content and estimated biomass production. The measured rates of photosynthesis could not explain the observed growth rates at high irradiances. Cultures of N. aeruginosum subjected to prey starvation were able to survive for at least 27 days in the light. The sequestered chloroplasts maintained their photosynthetic activity during the entire period of starvation, during which the population underwent 4 cell divisions. This indicates that N. aeruginosum has some control of the chloroplasts, which may be able to replicate. In conclusion, N. aeruginosum seems to be in an early stage of chloroplast acquisition with some control of its ingested chloroplasts."
