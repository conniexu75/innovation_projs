Verapamil or tetrodotoxin at 10(-6)M concentrations completely blocked the electric field effect. Tetracaine reduced the incorporation of [3H] thymidine in both control and electrically stimulated cells. The findings support the hypothesis that Na and Ca2 fluxes generated by the electrical perturbation trigger DNA synthesis in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1529319781,"The amino acid sequence of the large cyanogen bromide fragment (residues 11 to 127) derived from the NH2-terminal half of alpha-tropomyosin has been determined. This was achieved by automatic sequence analysis of the whole fragment as well as manual sequencing of fragments derived from tryptic digestion of the maleylated fragment and thermolytic, Myxobacter 495 alpha-lytic and Staphylococcus aureus protease digestion of the unmodified fragment. Methionine-containing overlap peptides have been isolated from tryptic digests of the maleylated protein as well as from S. aureus protease digests of the unmodified protein. Coupled with previously published information on the small cyanogen bromide fragments and methionine sequences of tropomyosin, these analyses have permitted the completion of the primary structure of the protein. The complete sequence differs by only 1 residue (Gln-24 instead of Glu-24) from that previously reported. Analysis of the sequence by several authors has permitted rational explanations for the stabilization of its coiled-coil structure, for the existence of its two chains in a nonstaggered arrangement, for a head-to-tail overlap of molecular ends of 8 to 9 residues, for the existence of 14 actin-binding sites on each tropomyosin molecule, and a suggestion for the site of binding of troponin-T."

Several differentiated lines derived from the EC cells, however, both produce and are sensitive to mouse interferon. Differentiation of EC cells in vitro is accompanied by development of interferon inducibility and sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1678903690,"Staphylococcus aureus H membranes were found to contain four major binding components: Mr = 115,000; Mr = 100,000 doublet; and Mr = 46,000. The low molecular weight protein bound penicillin reversibly and was purified by prebinding membranes with penicillin prior to affinity chromatography. The purified protein catalyzed transpeptidase and carboxypeptidase reactions using di[14C]acetyl-L-lysyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine as the substrate and glycine and hydroxylamine as the acceptors. In addition, the enzyme catalyzed a penicillinase reaction. Kinetic analysis of these reactions revealed similar Vmax values suggesting that, if there is a single active site, the rate-determining steps (i.e. deacetylation) are similar. Rapid denaturation of the enzyme.substrate complex resulted in the detection of covalent penicilloyl- and diacetyl-L-lysyl-D-alanyl.enzyme complexes by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."

https://openalex.org/W1541763346,"The nucleoside content of 18 S rRNA from rat liver is determined under conditions known to prevent the destruction of chemically labile modified nucleosides. Two base-modified nucleosides, not completely identified before, are shown to be N6-methyladenosine and 7-methylguanosine. The results further demonstrate the presence of a hitherto unidentified component of 18 S rRNA whose spectra and chromatographic properties are identical with that of N4-acetylcytidine. In addition, this compound is not detectable in 28 S rRNA nor in 16 S rRNA derived from the small ribosomal subunit of Escherichia coli. However, it appears to be conserved in the small ribosomal subunit of eukaryotes, since it is also present in yeast 17 S rRNA and chicken liver 18 S rRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1507839279,"Abstract Rat hearts were perfused simultaneously with [8-3H] AMP and [8-14C]adenosine. [8-3H] AMP was hydrolzyed by 5'-nucleotidase to produce intra- and extracellular [8-3H] adenosine. Comparison of the specific activities of [3H]- and [14C]adenosine in the heart cells with the specific activities of [3H]- and [14C]adenosine in the effluent perfusate showed that much more [3H]adenosine accumulated in the tissue than would be expected if extracellular adenosine were the immediate precursor of intracellular adenosine. Conversely, perfusion of rat hearts with [8-14C]AMP and [8-3H]adenosine led to a much greater accumulation of intracellular [14C]adenosine than would be expected from an uptake of adenosine from the perfusate. These results are interpreted to be due to hydrolysis of extracellular AMP by 5'-nucleotidase, located in the plasma membrane, and release of the resulting adenosine inside the cell. Measurements of the specific activities of 3H and 14C in ATP, ADP, AMP, and inosine support this interpretation."

https://openalex.org/W2992741145,"Nucleosomes were treated with increasing concentrations of exonuclease III (Exo III) from E. coll. At low levels of Exo III, the heterogeneous distribution of monomers (with associated DNA fragments ranging in size between 140 and 170 bp) is “trimmed” down to a discrete core of 140 bp. The “trimming” of monomers to 140 bp results from a 3′ exonucleolytic digestion accompanied by a 5′ clipping activity which is specific for the conformation of internucleosomal DNA. At higher concentrations of Exo III, the enzyme digests the 140 bp “trimmed” nucleosome core from both 3′ ends without associated 5′ nuclease activity. Most striking is the observation that the fragments produced during such a digestion display discrete single-stranded lengths that are integer multiples of 10 bases. For some dimer nucleosomes, Exo III can digest as many as 200 bases from at least one 3′ end and produce a 10 base interval ladder from about 400 bases down to 180 bases. This suggests that the enzyme can traverse the length of an entire nucleosome without destroying whatever structural features are necessary to produce a 10 base DNA ladder."
https://openalex.org/W1604712105,"Amino acid sequence analysis of the large cyanogen bromide fragment (residues 142 to 281) derived from the COOH-terminal half of the mixed tropomyosin population of rabbit skeletal muscle has been carried out. The isolation and sequence analysis of peptides derived from chymotryptic digests and from tryptic digests of the maleylated fragment permitted the alignment of the complete sequence except for the assignment of acids or amides at residues 142, 144, and 145. Selected peptides from a Myxobacter 495 alpha-lytic protease digest have confirmed certain overlaps. Based on previously published data the sequence can be extended to residue 284, the COOH-terminal end of the protein. In fourteen positions, amino acid substitutions have been observed. In one of these (residue 199) the sequence evidence indicates a minimum of four different polypeptide chains in the mixed tropomyosin population. The assignment of particular amino acid residues to these positions for the major alpha-component of rabbit skeletal tropomyosin has been based on the relative recoveries of peptides containing different residues in these positions."

https://openalex.org/W2163557440,"Abstract Eleven variant lines of Shionogi carcinoma cells were screened for dependent or autonomous growth, concentration of cytoplasmic receptor (CR), uptake of androgens into the nucleus (NU) and displaceable nuclear binding (DNB). The results afford a basis for dividing the variant lines into one class of dependent cells and three classes of autonomous cells. Class 1 dependent cells have mean values of CR, 1400 molecules per cell; NU, 6500 molecules per 30 min per nucleus; and DNB, 370 molecules per nucleus. By comparison, class 2 autonomous cells have similar values for CR and NU, but a lower value for DNB (80 molecules per nucleus). Class 3 autonomous cells have uniformly lower values relative to those of class 1 cells (CR, 170 molecules per cell; NU, 400 molecules per 30 min per nucleus; DNB, 40 molecules per nucleus). Class 4 autonomous cells have reduced values for CR and NU, but a DNB value similar to that of class 1 cells. We postulate that the cytoplasmic receptor in class 2 cells fails to become nuclear-bound owing to a defect in the function of the receptor or its acceptor. Conversely, the receptor in class 4 cells appears to become nuclear-bound in the absence of testosterone. Owing to this, the recycling of receptor and the uptake of androgens into the nucleus may be inhibited. Alone, or in combination, the CR and NU phenotypes do not predict for hormonal dependence, but when screening includes a test for DNB, the criteria are sufficient to predict dependence or autonomy for 100% of the tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2072394898,"When human erythrocytes suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing IgG were first dialyzed against a hypotonic solution and then dialyzed against PBS, IgG molecules were entrapped within resealed erythrocyte ghosts. The concentration of IgG inside the ghosts was about 33% of its concentration in the dialysis bag. With the aid of HVJ (Sendai virus), ghosts containing rabbit IgG antibody against fragment A of diphtheria toxin were fused with toxin-sensitive FL cells. The fused FL recipients were found to be resistant to the action of diphtheria toxin. Clones derived from the resistant recipient cells, however, became sensitive to the toxin again. Antifragment A neutralized the enzymic activity of isolated fragment A in vitro, but did not protect FL cells or rabbit skin against the complete toxin."

https://openalex.org/W1600668034,"Hydrogenosomes of the anaerobic flagellate Tritrichomonas foetus can use oxygen as terminal electron acceptor in pyruvate metabolism. In particles broken with the detergent, Triton X-100 or by repeated freezing and thawing, pyruvate-supported respiration is greatly enhanced by coenzyme A. Additions of small amounts of CoA result in a phenomenon resembling respiratory control. ADP and GDP also have a stimulatory effect; however, the rate of respiration in the presence of saturating concentrations of CoA is always much higher than with saturating concentrations of ADP or GDP. The results suggest that the availability of CoA as acetyl acceptor is the primary controlling factor of pyruvate oxidation and that the observed effect of nucleotide diphosphates (Cerkasov, J., Cerkasovova, A., Kulda, J., and Vilhelmova, D. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 1207-1214) is explained by their participation in reactions that liberate CoA from acyl-CoA complexes in connection with substrate level phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1539033735,"Silkmoth eggshell (chorion) proteins have been characterized by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate and isoelectric focusing polyacrylamide gels; up to 33 and 41 components, respectively, were detected from a single chorion. Some of these components are polymorphic, being absent from chorions of certain animals. A system of nomenclature for all chorion proteins is presented, based on their separation on sodium dodecyl sulfate and isoelectric focusing gels. The chorion is enriched in glycine, alanine, cysteine, and tyrosine and poor in methionine and histidine. The proteins were fractionated into four partially overlapping groups; all four are enriched in the above amino acids, although significant differences exist. Further fractionation by isoelectric focusing of one of the above groups, s/s, yielded seven components, two of which are homogeneous both on sodium dodecyl sulfate and isoelectric focusing gels. The amino acid compositions, molecular weights, and solubility properties of the components share certain features which distinguish s/s as a group from the other three groups. The sequence of the first 67 NH2-terminal residues of a homogeneous protein purified from s/s has been determined. The protein contains a cysteine-rich tail (3 cysteines in the first 18 residues) followed by a 49-residue segment which contains only a single cysteine residue. This latter segment also contains two different tetrapeptide sequences which are each repeated, one twice and the other four times."

The molecular weight of the enzyme is between 90,000 and 108,000; it contains two pairs of subunits having molecular weights of about 23,000 and 25,000. The enzyme is active from pH 4 to above pH 9 and has a broad pH activity optimum from about pH 6.5 to 8.0. Butyrate, acetoacetate, and their CoA thioesters are the preferred substrates but the salts of a number of C,-C,; monocarboxylic acids are also utilized at lower rates. Apparent K, and relative V,,, values are reported. When acetoacetate or acetoacetyl-CoA serves as one substrate, the reaction rate is strongly stimulated by lower concentrations of monovalent or divalent cations and, after an optimal concentration is reached, progressively inhibited by higher concentrations. The activity is insensitive to the nature of the accompanying anion. The optimal concentration of divalent cations falls in the range of 1.2 to 12 mM and that of monovalent cations from 80 to 250 mM. Since rate stimulation by cations does not occur with substrates other than acetoacetate or acetoacetyl-CoA, it is probable that cations are required to facilitate the enolization of acetoacetyl at some stage of the reaction.

https://openalex.org/W1519429368,"Abstract The gamma- and Bbeta-polypeptide chains of purified human fibrinogen have each been resolved into two major species: gammaL and gammaR and BbetaL and BbetaR. These molecular variants, separable on CM-cellulose, differ from each other in sialic acid content: approximately 2 residues of sialic acid per molecule of polypeptide chain for the L species to 1 residue of sialic acid per molecule for the R species. The two types of each polypeptide are demonstrable in preparations of fibrinogen from single donors as well as in pooled fibrinogen. The L and R forms of the gamma chains or the Bbeta chains do not differ in their electrophoretic mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, suggesting that they are similar in molecular weight. They are also indistinguishable in polyacrylamide gels in the presence of urea at pH 2.7. Maps of ninhydrin-positive tryptic peptides of the L and R forms of the gamma chain displayed differences within a small group of peptides which have been shown to contain the sialic acid residues present in the gamma-polypeptides. No differences between the peptide maps of BbetaL and BbetaR chains were obvious. A larger ratio of L/R in the gamma and Bbeta chains of dysfibrinogenemia fibrinogen than in those of normal fibrinogen explains the higher content of sialic acid measured in the native Zurich II fibrinogen molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1574663019,"Three-dimensional 2.8 A resolution x-ray crystallographic studies show that toluenesulfonamide and pipsylamide bind isomorphously in the aromatic specificity binding site of alpha-chymotrypsin. However, their orientation differs by about 90 degrees from that usually associated with substrate-like molecules, suggesting a nonproductive binding mode. A secondary binding site is also operative in one molecule of the dimer of the pipsylamide derivative and it is located some 22 A from the active site; however, this site is not operative in the toluenesulfonamide derivative. Binding of toluenesulfonamide and pipsylamide in the specificity site occurs without inducing any significant changes in the native enzyme structure, in contrast to the behavior observed upon tosylation or upon transition state analogue binding of phenylethaneboronic acid. The structural changes accompanying the formation of the latter derivatives are generally asymmetric with respect to the dimeric structure of alpha-chymotrypsin and are generally confined to the binding domain or cylinder 2 of the enzyme (sequence greater than 122). These changes are displayed in a new way via diagonal distance map representation."
