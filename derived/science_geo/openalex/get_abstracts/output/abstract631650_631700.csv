Three papers in this issue present brain-scale studies of neuronal activity and dynamics (see the Perspective by Huk and Hart). Allen et al. found that in thirsty mice, there is widespread neural activity related to stimuli that elicit licking and drinking. Individual neurons encoded task-specific responses, but every brain area contained neurons with different types of response. Optogenetic stimulation of thirst-sensing neurons in one area of the brain reinstated drinking and neuronal activity across the brain that previously signaled thirst. Gründemann et al. investigated the activity of mouse basal amygdala neurons in relation to behavior during different tasks. Two ensembles of neurons showed orthogonal activity during exploratory and nonexploratory behaviors, possibly reflecting different levels of anxiety experienced in these areas. Stringer et al. analyzed spontaneous neuronal firing, finding that neurons in the primary visual cortex encoded both visual information and motor activity related to facial movements. The variability of neuronal responses to visual stimuli in the primary visual area is mainly related to arousal and reflects the encoding of latent behavioral states.

https://openalex.org/W2938141387,"High-performance piezoelectrics benefit transducers and sensors in a variety of electromechanical applications. The materials with the highest piezoelectric charge coefficients (d33) are relaxor-PbTiO3 crystals, which were discovered two decades ago. We successfully grew Sm-doped Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (Sm-PMN-PT) single crystals with even higher d33 values ranging from 3400 to 4100 picocoulombs per newton, with variation below 20% over the as-grown crystal boule, exhibiting good property uniformity. We characterized the Sm-PMN-PT on the atomic scale with scanning transmission electron microscopy and made first-principles calculations to determine that the giant piezoelectric properties arise from the enhanced local structural heterogeneity introduced by Sm3+ dopants. Rare-earth doping is thus identified as a general strategy for introducing local structural heterogeneity in order to enhance the piezoelectricity of relaxor ferroelectric crystals."
https://openalex.org/W2807819165,"Entanglement is the key feature of many-body quantum systems, and the development of new tools to probe it in the laboratory is an outstanding challenge. Measuring the entropy of different partitions of a quantum system provides a way to probe its entanglement structure. Here, we present and experimentally demonstrate a new protocol for measuring entropy, based on statistical correlations between randomized measurements. Our experiments, carried out with a trapped-ion quantum simulator, prove the overall coherent character of the system dynamics and reveal the growth of entanglement between its parts - both in the absence and presence of disorder. Our protocol represents a universal tool for probing and characterizing engineered quantum systems in the laboratory, applicable to arbitrary quantum states of up to several tens of qubits."
https://openalex.org/W2804416632,"An interacting quantum system that is subject to disorder may cease to thermalize due to localization of its constituents, thereby marking the breakdown of thermodynamics. The key to our understanding of this phenomenon lies in the system's entanglement, which is experimentally challenging to measure. We realize such a many-body-localized system in a disordered Bose-Hubbard chain and characterize its entanglement properties through particle fluctuations and correlations. We observe that the particles become localized, suppressing transport and preventing the thermalization of subsystems. Notably, we measure the development of non-local correlations, whose evolution is consistent with a logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy - the hallmark of many-body localization. Our work experimentally establishes many-body localization as a qualitatively distinct phenomenon from localization in non-interacting, disordered systems."

Available methods to find off-targets generally do not work in vivo or detect single-nucleotide changes. Three papers in this issue report new methods for monitoring gene-editing tools in vivo (see the Perspective by Kempton and Qi). Wienert et al. followed the recruitment of a DNA repair protein to DNA breaks induced by CRISPR-Cas9, enabling unbiased detection of off-target editing in cellular and animal models. Zuo et al. identified off-targets without the interference of natural genetic heterogeneity by injecting base editors into one blastomere of a two-cell mouse embryo and leaving the other genetically identical blastomere unedited. Jin et al. performed whole-genome sequencing on individual, genome-edited rice plants to identify unintended mutations. Cytosine, but not adenine, base editors induced numerous single-nucleotide variants in both mouse and rice. Science , this issue p. 286 , p. 289 , p. 292 ; see also p. 234"
https://openalex.org/W2938268541,"We report a three-orders-of-magnitude variation of carrier lifetimes in exotic crystalline phases of gold nanoclusters (NCs) in addition to the well-known face-centered cubic structure, including hexagonal close-packed (hcp) Au30 and body-centered cubic (bcc) Au38 NCs protected by the same type of capping ligand. The bcc Au38 NC had an exceptionally long carrier lifetime (4.7 microseconds) comparable to that of bulk silicon, whereas the hcp Au30 NC had a very short lifetime (1 nanosecond). Although the presence of ligands may, in general, affect carrier lifetimes, experimental and theoretical results showed that the drastically different recombination lifetimes originate in the different overlaps of wave functions between the tetrahedral Au4 building blocks in the hierarchical structures of these NCs."

https://openalex.org/W2937147839,"Malignancies arising from mutation of tumor suppressors have unexplained tissue proclivity. For example, BAP1 encodes a widely expressed deubiquitinase for histone H2A, but germline mutations are predominantly associated with uveal melanomas and mesotheliomas. We show that BAP1 inactivation causes apoptosis in mouse embryonic stem cells, fibroblasts, liver, and pancreatic tissue but not in melanocytes and mesothelial cells. Ubiquitin ligase RNF2, which silences genes by monoubiquitinating H2A, promoted apoptosis in BAP1-deficient cells by suppressing expression of the prosurvival genes Bcl2 and Mcl1. In contrast, BAP1 loss in melanocytes had little impact on expression of prosurvival genes, instead inducing Mitf Thus, BAP1 appears to modulate gene expression by countering H2A ubiquitination, but its loss only promotes tumorigenesis in cells that do not engage an RNF2-dependent apoptotic program."

https://openalex.org/W2940313036,"We recently described myonectin (also known as erythroferrone) as a novel skeletal muscle-derived myokine with metabolic functions. Here, we use a genetic mouse model to determine myonectin's requirement for metabolic homeostasis. Female myonectin-deficient mice had larger gonadal fat pads and developed mild insulin resistance when fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and had reduced food intake during refeeding after an unfed period but were otherwise indistinguishable from wild-type littermates. Male mice lacking myonectin, however, had reduced physical activity when fed ad libitum and in the postprandial state but not during the unfed period. When stressed with an HFD, myonectin-knockout male mice had significantly elevated VLDL-triglyceride (TG) and strikingly impaired lipid clearance from circulation following an oral lipid load. Fat distribution between adipose and liver was also altered in myonectin-deficient male mice fed an HFD. Greater fat storage resulted in significantly enlarged adipocytes and was associated with increased postprandial lipoprotein lipase activity in adipose tissue. Parallel to this was a striking reduction in liver steatosis due to significantly reduced TG accumulation. Liver metabolite profiling revealed additional significant changes in bile acids and 1-carbon metabolism pathways. Combined, our data affirm the physiologic importance of myonectin in regulating local and systemic lipid metabolism.-Little, H. C., Rodriguez, S., Lei, X., Tan, S. Y., Stewart, A. N., Sahagun, A., Sarver, D. C., Wong, G. W. Myonectin deletion promotes adipose fat storage and reduces liver steatosis."
https://openalex.org/W2936139108,"An improved red blood cell (RBC) membrane model is developed based on the bilayer coupling model (BCM) to accurately predict the complete sequence of stomatocyte-discocyte-echinocyte (SDE) transformation of a RBC. The coarse-grained (CG)–RBC membrane model is proposed to predict the minimum energy configuration of the RBC from the competition between lipid-bilayer bending resistance and cytoskeletal shear resistance under given reference constraints. In addition to the conventional membrane surface area, cell volume and bilayer-leaflet-area-difference constraints, a new constraint: total-membrane-curvature is proposed in the model to better predict RBC shapes in agreement with experimental observations. A quantitative evaluation of several cellular measurements including length, thickness and shape factor, is performed for the first time, between CG-RBC model predicted and three-dimensional (3D) confocal microscopy imaging generated RBC shapes at equivalent reference constraints. The validated CG-RBC membrane model is then employed to investigate the effect of reduced cell volume and elastic length scale on SDE transformation, to evaluate the RBC deformability during SDE transformation, and to identify the most probable RBC cytoskeletal reference state. The CG-RBC membrane model can predict the SDE shape behaviour under diverse shape-transforming scenarios, in-vitro RBC storage, microvascular circulation and flow through microfluidic devices."
https://openalex.org/W2938558056,"Continuum of Care (CoC) is an essential strategy to prevent maternal and child deaths where health services are arranged in a pathway throughout pregnancy, childbirth and after delivery. However, CoC is still a challenge in Nepal. This study aimed to investigate the correlates of CoC from pregnancy to the postnatal period in Nepalese women aged 15 to 49 years. Secondary analysis was performed on the data from Nepal Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey. This led to a sample size of 2086 women who had a live birth within two years preceding the survey. We constructed three outcome models and conducted multivariable logistic regression, to assess socio-economic and demographic correlates of CoC from pregnancy to childbirth to postnatal period. Overall, 41% of the women received Antenatal Care (ANC), delivery from Skilled Birth Attendant (SBA) as well as the Postnatal Care (PNC) during their most recent birth. Women from rural areas (aOR 0.25, 95%CI: 0.18, 0.36) had reduced odds of receiving CoC while women belonging to advantaged ethnic group (aOR 1.61, 95%CI: 1.18 2.19), from middle wealth status (aOR 2.56, 95%CI: 1.68, 3.91) and upper (aOR 4.50, 95%CI: 3.07, 6.59) wealth status, and women having access to media (aOR 1.76, 95%CI: 1.31, 2.37) had higher odds of receiving CoC from pregnancy to postnatal period. Having more than two births reduced the odds of CoC by 30% (aOR 0.70, 95%CI: 0.50, 0.98). These factors were also significantly associated with ANC services and the continuum from ANC to delivery SBA. The findings suggest that the majority of Nepalese women lack a continuity of care during their pregnancy and childbirth, and several socioeconomic factors affect the spectrum of CoC. Efforts to improve maternal health services utilization in a continuum require strategies that remove demand and supply barriers of health care utilization."
https://openalex.org/W2936437338,"Mutations in the genes encoding telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and telomerase’s RNA components as well as shortened telomeres are risk factors for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, where repetitive injury to the alveolar epithelium is considered a key factor in pathogenesis. Given the importance of TERT in stem cells, we hypothesized that TERT plays an important role in epithelial repair and that its deficiency results in exacerbation of fibrosis by impairing this repair/regenerative process. To evaluate the role of TERT in epithelial cells, we generated type II alveolar epithelial cell (AECII)–specific TERT conditional knockout (SPC-Tert cKO) mice by crossing floxed Tert mice with inducible SPC-driven Cre mice. SPC-Tert cKO mice did not develop pulmonary fibrosis spontaneously up to 9 months of TERT deficiency. However, upon bleomycin treatment, they exhibited enhanced lung injury, inflammation, and fibrosis compared with control mice, accompanied by increased pro-fibrogenic cytokine expression but without a significant effect on AECII telomere length. Moreover, selective TERT deficiency in AECII diminished their proliferation and induced cellular senescence. These findings suggest that AECII-specific TERT deficiency enhances pulmonary fibrosis by heightening susceptibility to bleomycin-induced epithelial injury and diminishing epithelial regenerative capacity because of increased cellular senescence. We confirmed evidence for increased AECII senescence in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis lungs, suggesting potential clinical relevance of the findings from our animal model. Our results suggest that TERT has a protective role in AECII, unlike its pro-fibrotic activity, observed previously in fibroblasts, indicating that TERT’s role in pulmonary fibrosis is cell type–specific.

https://openalex.org/W2937414878,"Plant phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) is comprised of three clades: FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1) and MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (MFT). FT/TFL1-like clades regulate identities of the determinate and indeterminate meristems, and ultimately affect flowering time and plant architecture. MFT is generally considered to be the ancestor of FT/TFL1, but its function is not well understood. Here, two MFT homoeologous gene pairs in Gossypium hirsutum, GhMFT1-A/D and GhMFT2-A/D, were identified by genome-wide identification of MFT-like genes. Detailed expression analysis revealed that GhMFT1 and GhMFT2 homoeologous genes were predominately expressed in ovules, and their expression increased remarkably during ovule development but decreased quickly during seed germination. Expressions of GhMFT1 and GhMFT2 homoeologous genes in germinating seeds were upregulated in response to abscisic acid (ABA), and their expressions also responded to gibberellin (GA). In addition, ectopic overexpression of GhMFT1 and GhMFT2 in Arabidopsis inhibited seed germination at the early stage. Gene transcription analysis showed that ABA metabolism genes ABA-INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3) and ABI5, GA signal transduction pathway genes REPRESSOR OF ga1-3 (RGA) and RGA-LIKE2 (RGL2) were all upregulated in the 35S:GhMFT1 and 35S:GhMFT2 transgenic Arabidopsis seeds. GhMFT1 and GhMFT2 localize in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and both interact with a cotton bZIP transcription factor GhFD, suggesting that both of GhMFT1, 2 have similar intracellular regulation mechanisms. Taken together, the results suggest that GhMFT1 and GhMFT2 may act redundantly and differentially in the regulation of seed germination."
https://openalex.org/W2937422357,"Aromatase inhibitors are the preferred treatment for certain women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, but evidence suggests that women with obesity experience aromatase inhibitor resistance at higher rates. To compare how stromal cells derived from women who are lean or obese influence response to the aromatase inhibitor (anastrazole), we incorporated patient-derived stroma in a previously characterized MCF7-derived in vitro duct model. Coculture with adipose stromal cells enabled the metabolism of testosterone (T) to E2, which induced estrogen response element activity, epithelial proliferation, and hyperplasia in MCF7 cells. The effects of T were inhibited by the ER antagonist tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitor anastrazole and were increased by the aromatase inducer dexamethasone. Primary mammary adipose stromal cells derived from women with obesity displayed increased aromatase mRNA compared with lean controls. MCF7-derived ducts cocultured with obese stromal cells exhibited higher maximal aromatization-induced ER transactivation and reduced anastrazole sensitivity, a difference not seen in 2-dimensional coculture. Finally, tamoxifen was more effective than anastrazole at reducing aromatization-induced ER transactivation and proliferation. These findings suggest that patient-specific responses to hormone therapies can be modeled and studied organotypically in vitro and add to evidence advocating obesity as a parameter to consider when identifying treatments for patients with ER-positive breast cancer.-Morgan, M. M., Arendt, L. M., Alarid, E. T., Beebe, D. J., Johnson, B. P.

https://openalex.org/W2939544334,"The availability of antibiotics presents medical practitioners with a prescribing dilemma. On the one hand, antibiotics provide a safe and effective treatment option for patients with bacterial infections, but at a population level, over-prescription reduces their effectiveness by facilitating the evolution of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotic medication. A game-theoretic investigation, including analysis of equilibrium strategies, evolutionarily stability, and replicator dynamics, reveals that rational doctors, motivated to attain the best outcomes for their own patients, will prescribe antibiotics irrespective of the level of antibiotic resistance in the population and the behavior of other doctors, although they would achieve better long-term outcomes if their prescribing were more restrained. Ever-increasing antibiotic resistance may therefore be inevitable unless some means are found of modifying the payoffs of this potentially catastrophic social dilemma."
https://openalex.org/W2937257532,"A single pool of multipotent retinal progenitor cells give rise to the diverse cell types within the mammalian retina. Such cellular diversity is due to precise control of various cellular processes like cell specification, proliferation, differentiation, and maturation. Circadian clock genes can control the expression of key regulators of cell cycle progression and therefore can synchronize the cell cycle state of a heterogeneous population of cells. Here we show that the protein encoded by the circadian clock gene brain and muscle arnt-like protein-1 (Bmal1) is expressed in the embryonic retina and is required to regulate the timing of cell cycle exit. Accordingly, loss of Bmal1 during retinal neurogenesis results in increased S-phase entry and delayed cell cycle exit. Disruption in cell cycle kinetics affects the timely generation of the appropriate neuronal population thus leading to an overall decrease in the number of retinal ganglion cells, amacrine cells, and an increase in the number of the late-born type II cone bipolar cells as well as the Müller glia. Additionally, the mislocalized Müller cells are observed in the photoreceptor layer in the Bmal1 conditional mutants. These changes affect the functional integrity of the visual circuitry as we report a significant delay in visual evoked potential implicit time in the retina-specific Bmal1 null animals. Our results demonstrate that Bmal1 is required to maintain the balance between the neural and glial cells in the embryonic retina by coordinating the timing of cell cycle entry and exit. Thus, Bmal1 plays an essential role during retinal neurogenesis affecting both development and function of the mature retina.-Sawant, O. B., Jidigam, V. K., Fuller, R. D., Zucaro, O. F., Kpegba, C., Yu, M., Peachey, N. S., Rao, S. The circadian clock gene Bmal1 is required to control the timing of retinal neurogenesis and lamination of Müller glia in the mouse retina."
https://openalex.org/W2936541063,"Many indomethacin amides and esters are cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-selective inhibitors, providing a framework for the design of COX-2-targeted imaging and cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Although previous studies have suggested that the amide or ester moiety of these inhibitors binds in the lobby region, a spacious alcove within the enzyme's membrane-binding domain, structural details have been lacking. Here, we present observations on the crystal complexes of COX-2 with two indomethacin-dansyl conjugates (compounds 1 and 2) at 2.22-A resolution. Both compounds are COX-2-selective inhibitors with IC50 values of 0.76 and 0.17 μm, respectively. Our results confirmed that the dansyl moiety is localized in and establishes hydrophobic interactions and several hydrogen bonds with the lobby of the membrane-binding domain. We noted that in both crystal structures, the linker tethering indomethacin to the dansyl moiety passes through the constriction at the mouth of the COX-2 active site, resulting in displacement and disorder of Arg-120, located at the opening to the active site. Both compounds exhibited higher inhibitory potency against a COX-2 R120A variant than against the WT enzyme. Inhibition kinetics of compound 2 were similar to those of the indomethacin parent compound against WT COX-2, and the R120A substitution reduced the time dependence of COX inhibition. These results provide a structural basis for the further design and optimization of conjugated COX reagents for imaging of malignant or inflammatory tissues containing high COX-2 levels."

Our study now places BoMan26B in context with related enzymes and reveals the structural basis for its specificity. BoMan26B prefers longer substrates and is less restricted by galactose side-groups than the mannanase BoMan26A of the same locus. Using galactomannan, BoMan26B generated a mixture of (galactosyl) manno-oligosaccharides shorter than mannohexaose. Three defined manno-oligosaccharides had affinity for the SusD-like surface–exposed glycan-binding protein, predicted to be implicated in saccharide transport. Co-incubation of BoMan26B and the periplasmic α-galactosidase BoGal36A increased the rate of galactose release by about 10-fold compared with the rate without BoMan26B. The results suggested that BoMan26B performs the initial attack on galactomannan, generating oligosaccharides that after transport to the periplasm are processed by BoGal36A.

Currently, quantitative analysis of FDG PET scans is limited to simple metrics like maximum standardized uptake value, metabolic tumor volume, or total lesion glycolysis, which have limited predictive value. The goal of this work was to assess the predictive potential of new (i.e., nonstandard) quantitative imaging features on head and neck cancer outcome.This retrospective study analyzed fifty-eight pre- and post-treatment FDG PET scans of patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer to calculate five standard and seventeen new features at baseline and post-treatment. Cox survival regression was used to assess the predictive potential of each quantitative imaging feature on disease-free survival.Analysis showed that the post-treatment change of the average tracer uptake in the rim background region immediately adjacent to the tumor normalized by uptake in the liver represents a novel PET feature that is associated with disease-free survival (HR 1.95; 95% CI 1.27, 2.99) and has good discriminative performance (c index 0.791).The reported findings define a promising new direction for quantitative imaging biomarker research in head and neck squamous cell cancer and highlight the potential role of new radiomics features in oncology decision making as part of precision medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2937530697,"The present study provides first evidence on the role of plasma gelsolin in protecting pulmonary thromboembolism and thrombosis in a mouse model. Gelsolin is the most abundant actin depolymerizing protein in plasma and its significantly depleted values have been reported in metabolic disorders including cardiovascular diseases and myocardial infarction. Though gelsolin replacement therapy (GRT) has been shown to be effective in some animal models, no such study has been reported for thrombotic diseases that are acutely in need of bio-therapeutics for immediate and lasting relief. Here, using mice model and recombinant human gelsolin (rhuGSN), we demonstrate the antithrombotic effect of gelsolin in ferric chloride induced thrombosis in carotid artery and thrombin induced acute pulmonary thromboembolism. In thrombosis model, arterial occlusion time was significantly enhanced upon subcutaneous (SC) treatment with 8 mg of gelsolin per mice viz. 15.83 minutes vs. 8 minutes in the placebo group. Pertinently, histopathological examination showed channel formation within the thrombi in the carotid artery following injection of gelsolin. Fluorescence molecular tomography imaging further confirmed that administration of gelsolin reduced thrombus formation following carotid artery injury. In thrombin-induced acute pulmonary thromboembolism, mice pretreated with aspirin or gelsolin showed 100 and 83.33% recovery, respectively. In contrast, complete mortality of mice was observed in vehicle treated group within 5 minutes of thrombin injection. Overall, our studies provide conclusive evidence on the thrombo-protective role of plasma gelsolin in mice model of pulmonary thromboembolism and thrombosis."

New treatment strategies are needed to improve the outcome. S. aureus coagulase promotes clot and fibrin formation. We hypothesized that dabigatran, could reduce valve vegetations and inflammation in S. aureus IE. Methods We used a rat model of severe aortic valve S. aureus IE. All infected animals were randomized to receive adjunctive dabigatran (10 mg/kg b.i.d., n = 12) or saline (controls, n = 11) in combination with gentamicin. Valve vegetation size, bacterial load, cytokine, cell integrins expression and peripheral platelets and neutrophils were assessed 3 days post-infection. Results Adjunctive dabigatran treatment significantly reduced valve vegetation size compared to controls (p< 0.0001). A significant reduction of the bacterial load in aortic valves was seen in dabigatran group compared to controls (p = 0.02), as well as expression of key pro-inflammatory markers keratinocyte-derived chemokine, IL-6, ICAM-1, TIMP-1, L-selectin (p< 0.04). Moreover, the dabigatran group had a 2.5-fold increase of circulating platelets compared to controls and a higher expression of functional and activated platelets (CD62p+) unbound to neutrophils. Conclusion Adjunctive dabigatran reduced the vegetation size, bacterial load, and inflammation in experimental S. aureus IE."
https://openalex.org/W2938791993,"The present study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the characteristics of negative blood oxygen level-dependent (Negative BOLD) signals during motor execution. Subjects repeated extension and flexion of one of the following: the right hand, left hand, right ankle, or left ankle. Negative BOLD responses during hand movements were observed in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the hand primary sensorimotor area (SMI), medial frontal gyrus (MeFG), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and superior frontal gyrus (SFG). Negative BOLD responses during foot movements were also noted in the bilateral hand SMI, MeFG, MFG, SFG, inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, cingulate gyrus (CG), fusiform gyrus, and precuneus. A conjunction analysis showed that portions of the MeFG and CG involving similar regions to those of the default mode network were commonly deactivated during voluntary movements of the right/left hand or foot. The present results suggest that three mechanisms are involved in the Negative BOLD responses observed during voluntary movements: (1) transcallosal inhibition from the contralateral to ipsilateral hemisphere in the SMI, (2) the deactivated neural network with several brain regions, and (3) the default mode network in the MeFG and CG."
https://openalex.org/W2936023458,"Objective Remission is a key goal in managing rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with sustained remission as the preferred sequelae of short-term remission. However little is known about the predictors of sustained remission for patients reaching remission. Using two independent cohorts, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence and predictors for sustained remission. Methods The study cohort consisted of subjects with RA from the Brigham and Women's Hospital Rheumatoid Arthritis Sequential Study (BRASS) and the Korean Observational Study Network for Arthritis (KORONA). We analyzed subjects who reached remission in 2009 with follow up data for two consecutive years. Remission was defined by the Disease Activity Score 28- (DAS28-CRP) of less than 2.6. Sustained remission was defined as three consecutive annual visits in remission. Predictors for sustained remission were identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 465 subjects were in remission in 2009. Sustained remission was achieved by 53 of 92 (57.5%) in BRASS and by 198 of 373 (53.1%) in KORONA. In multivariate analyses, baseline predictors of sustained remission were: disease duration less than 5 years [odds ratio (OR) 1.96, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.08–3.58], Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (MHAQ) score of 0 (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.18–2.74), and non-use of oral glucocorticoid (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.01–2.47). Conclusion More than half of RA subjects in remission in 2009 remained in remission through 2011. Short disease duration, no disability, and non-use of oral glucocorticoid at baseline were associated with sustained remission."

These morphologically indistinct species are identified by chromosome banding. Several molecular diagnostic techniques for distinguishing between An. coluzzii and An. gambiae are still under improvement. Although, the current SINE method for identification between An. coluzzii and An. gambiae works reliably, this study describes a refinement of the SINE method to increase sensitivity for identification of An. coluzzii, An. gambiae and An. arabiensis based on amplicon dissociation curve characteristics. Field-collected samples, laboratory-reared colonies and crossed specimens of the two species were used for the design of the protocol. An. gambiae, An. coluzzii, and hybrids of the two species were sampled from Ghana and An. arabiensis from Kenya. Samples were first characterised using conventional SINE PCR method, and further assayed using SYBR green, an intercalating fluorescent dye. The three species and hybrids were clearly differentiated using the melting temperature of the dissociation curves, with derivative peaks at 72°C for An. arabiensis, 75°C for An. gambiae and 86°C for An. coluzzii. The hybrids (An. gambiae / An. coluzzii) showed both peaks. This work is the first to describe a SYBR green real time PCR method for the characterization of An. arabiensis, An. gambiae and An. coluzzii and was purposely designed for basic melt-curve analysis (rather than high-resolution melt-curve) to allow it to be used on a wide range of real-time PCR machines."
https://openalex.org/W2937474526,"Background The study assessed the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection paradigm among the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients attending a tertiary hospital in Ghana. Also, the immunological and virological characterisation of these viruses, prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation was investigated. Method A total of 400 HIV infected (HIV type-1) treatment naïve subjects ≥18 years were enrolled and tested for HBsAg and anti-HCV. Hepatitis B virus serological profile was performed on samples that were HBV positive. CD4+ T-cell count and HIV-1 RNA viral loads were determined using BD FacsCalibur analyzer (USA) and COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan Analyzer (USA) respectively. Results The overall prevalence of HBV/HCV co-infection among the HIV-1 patients was 18.0%. The prevalence of HIV-HBV and HIV-HCV co-infections were 12.5% and 5.5% respectively. The prevalence of active viral hepatitis (HBeAg-positive) among HIV-HBV co-infected patients was 40%. None of the patients had anti-HBc IgM. HIV-HBV co-infection was associated with lower CD4+ T-cell count as well as higher HIV-1 viral load compared to both HIV mono- infection and HIV-HCV co- infection (p<0.05) respectively. HBeAg positivity was associated with severe immunosuppression and higher HIV viral load. Patients aged 18–33 years [aOR = 9.66(1.17–79.61); p = 0.035], male gender [aOR = 2.74(1.15–6.51); p = 0.023], primary education [aOR = 9.60(1.21–76.08); p = 0.032], secondary education [aOR = 14.67(1.82–118.08); p = 0.012] and being single [aOR = 2.88(1.12–7.39); p = 0.028] were independent risk factors of HIV-HBV co-infections but not HIV-HCV co-infections. Conclusion The present study highlights the predominance of HBV exposure among the HIV infected patients in Ghana. HBV coinfection was associated with severe immunosuppression and higher HIV-1 viral load."
https://openalex.org/W2938844439,"Sulfiredoxin (Srx) reduces hyperoxidized 2-cysteine–containing peroxiredoxins (Prxs) and protects cells against oxidative stress. Previous studies have shown that Srx is highly expressed in primary specimens of lung cancer patients and plays a pivotal role in lung tumorigenesis and cancer progression. However, the oncogenic mechanisms of Srx in cancer are incompletely understood. In this study, we found that Srx knockdown sensitizes lung cancer cells to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress–induced cell death. Through MS analysis, we determined that Srx forms a complex with the ER-resident protein thioredoxin domain–containing protein 5 (TXNDC5). Using reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence imaging, subcellular fractionation, and domain-mapping assays with site-specific mutagenesis and purified recombinant proteins, we further characterized the Srx–TXNDC5 interaction. In response to ER stress but not to oxidative stress, Srx exhibits an increased association with TXNDC5, facilitating the retention of Srx in the ER. Of note, TXNDC5 knockdown in lung cancer cells inhibited cell proliferation and repressed anchorage-independent colony formation and migration, but increased cell invasion and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Using immunohistochemical staining, we demonstrate that TXNDC5 is highly expressed in patient-derived lung cancer specimens. Bioinformatics analysis of publicly available data sets revealed that those with high Srx levels have significantly shorter survival and that those with high TXNDC5 levels have longer survival. We conclude that the cellular levels of Srx and TXNDC5 may be useful as biomarkers to predict the survival of individuals with lung cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2938614549,"Limited information is available on how fetal growth retardation (FGR) affects the lung in the neonatal period in males and females. This led us to test the hypothesis that FGR alters lung mechanics and the surfactant system during the neonatal period. To test this hypothesis a model of FGR was utilized in which pregnant rat dams were fed a low protein diet during both the gestation and lactation period. We subsequently analyzed lung mechanics using a FlexiVent ventilator in male and female pups at postnatal day 7 and 21. Lung lavage material was obtained at postnatal day 1, 7 and 21, and was used for analysis of the surfactant system which included measurement of the pool size of surfactant and its subfraction as well as the surface tension reducing ability of the surfactant. The main result of the study was a significantly lower lung compliance and higher tissue elastance which was observed in FGR female offspring at day 21 compared to control offspring. In addition, female LP offspring exhibited lower surfactant pool sizes at postnatal day 1compared to controls. These changes were not observed in the male offspring. It is concluded that FGR has a different impact on pulmonary function and on surfactant in female, as compared to male, offspring."
https://openalex.org/W2940024243,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifactorial joint disease and a common disabling condition in the elderly population. The associated pain and pathohistological changes in cartilage are common features of OA in both humans and animal models. Shea nut oil extract (SheaFlex75) contains a high triterpenoid concentration and has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiarthritic effects in both human and animal studies. In this study, we aim to investigate the potential of SheaFlex75 to prevent articular cartilage deterioration in a rat model of chronic OA progression. By employing anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) with medial meniscectomy (MMx)-induced OA, we found attenuation of both early and chronic onset OA pain and cartilage degeneration in ACLT+MMx rats receiving SheaFlex75 dietary supplementation. Under long-term oral administration, the rats with induced OA presented sustained protection of both pain and OA cartilage integrity compared to the OA-control rats. Moreover, rats subjected to long-term SheaFlex75 ingestion showed normal biochemical profiles (AST, BUN and total cholesterol) and presented relatively lower triglycerides (TGs) and body weights than the OA-control rats, which suggested the safety of prolonged use of this oil extract. Based on the present evidence, preventive management is advised to delay/prevent onset and progression in OA patients. Therefore, we suggest that SheaFlex75 may be an effective management strategy for symptom relief and cartilage protection in patients with both acute and chronic OA."

These species present a similar morphology but produce different ingredients when they are used as medicinal products. In this study, a DNA barcoding- (Bar-) high-resolution melting (HRM) technique was developed using internal transcribed sequence 2 (ITS2) to differentiate between Senna alata and Senna tora as a result of significant differences in their melting profiles. We used this approach for confirmation of S. alata and S. tora raw materials, and we examined the chondroprotective properties of the ethanolic extracts of S. alata and S. tora using a porcine model of cartilage degradation induced by a combination of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and IL-1β. We found that both Senna ethanolic extracts, at a concentration of 25 μg/mL, effectively prevented cartilage degradation. Rhein and aloe-emodin were present in the extract of S. alata but not in that of S. tora. We observed a reduction in the release of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (S-GAGs) and hyaluronic acid (HA) into media in both treatments of Senna extracts, which indicated proteoglycan preservation in explant tissues. These results suggest that neither rhein nor aloe-emodin are the main factors responsible for cartilage-protecting properties. Taken together, results show that both S. alata and S. tora are promising for further development as anti-osteoarthritic agents and that Bar-HRM using ITS2 could be applied for species confirmation with Senna products."

The species is known to display the sexual system of protandric simultaneous hermaphrodite. In this study, based on captive bred specimens, the complete ontogenetic gonad development of L. vittata was studied both morphologically and histologically, from newly settled juveniles until they reached euhermaphrodite phase. It was found that in all specimens examined (carapace length: 1.8-8.5 mm), including the newly settled juveniles, possessed ovotestes, which comprised of an anterior ovarian and a posterior testicular part. Based on both morphological (e.g., size, color and shape) and histological features (e.g., oogenesis and spermatogenesis), four gonadal development stages were defined and described for L. vittata. From Stage I to III, the testicular part of the gonad became gradually mature but the ovarian part was still immature, which is defined as the male phase. At the male phase, cincinulli (5-8 hooks) presented at the tips of the appendix interna on the first pair of pleopods while appendices masculinae (AM), in a form of a stick structure with spines, presented at the inner edge of the appendix interna (AI) on the second pair of pleopods. At Stage IV, both the testicular part and the ovarian part were mature and hence is defined as euhermaphrodite phase. At the euhermaphrodite phase, most individuals lacked cincinulli and appendices masculinae on the first and second pair of pleopods respectively. This is the first time that complete ontogenetic gonadal and external sexual character development have been described and staged for a species from the genus Lysmata from newly settled juveniles to euhermaphrodite phase."

High-frequency MSI (MSI-H) colorectal cancers (CRCs) are known to have different clinicopathological features compared with microsatellite stable (MSS) CRCs. In addition, previous studies have shown that type2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a risk factor for malignant tumors including CRCs. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between T2DM and MSI-H colorectal cancer.The study design is a single center, cross-sectional study. Data from a series of 936 patients with CRCs were collected and MSI status was assessed.In total, 29 (3.1%) and 907 (96.9%) tumors were classified as having MSI-H and low-frequency microsatellite instability or being MSS (MSS), respectively. Of the 936 patients, 275 (29.6%) were associated with T2DM. One (3.4%) of the 29 MSI-H patients and 274 (30.2%) of the 907 MSS patients had T2DM. Thus, the incidence of T2DM was significantly less frequent in MSI-H compared with MSS patients (Fisher's exact test: p = 0.0007).We conclude that MSS tumors are significantly more common than MSI-H tumors among individuals with T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W2991905427,"Here we study the NP-complete $K$-SAT problem. Although the worst-case complexity of NP-complete problems is conjectured to be exponential, there exist parametrized random ensembles of problems where solutions can typically be found in polynomial time for suitable ranges of the parameter. In fact, random $K$-SAT, with $\alpha=M/N $ as control parameter, can be solved quickly for small enough values of $\alpha$. It shows a phase transition between a satisfiable phase and an unsatisfiable phase. For branch and bound algorithms, which operate in the space of feasible Boolean configurations, the empirically hardest problems are located only close to this phase transition. Here we study $K$-SAT ($K=3,4$) and the related optimization problem MAX-SAT by a linear programming approach, which is widely used for practical problems and allows for polynomial run time. In contrast to branch and bound it operates outside the space of feasible configurations. On the other hand, finding a solution within polynomial time is not guaranteed. We investigated several variants like including artificial objective functions, so called cutting-plane approaches, and a mapping to the NP-complete vertex-cover problem. We observed several easy-hard transitions, from where the problems are typically solvable (in polynomial time) using the given algorithms, respectively, to where they are not solvable in polynomial time. For the related vertex-cover problem on random graphs these easy-hard transitions can be identified with structural properties of the graphs, like percolation transitions. For the present random $K$-SAT problem we have investigated numerous structural properties also exhibiting clear transitions, but they appear not be correlated to the here observed easy-hard transitions. This renders the behaviour of random $K$-SAT more complex than, e.g., the vertex-cover problem."

In this study, we aimed to determine whether fluid supplementation can be used as a welfare-based intervention to minimize animal suffering. C57Bl/6 females undergoing acute colitis by administration of 3% DSS in drinking water were supplemented with 1 mL intraperitoneal injections of NaCl and compared to non-supplemented control mice. Mouse behavior and locomotive activity were assessed on days 5–6 after DSS initiation by means of tail suspension, novel object recognition and open field activity tests. Mice were euthanized after either the acute (day 7) or the recovery phase (day 12) of colitis and inflammation, epithelial proliferation, and differentiation were assessed by means of histology, immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR, and western blot. We found that fluid-supplemented mice had reduced signs of colitis with no alterations in behavior or locomotive activity. Furthermore, we observed an accelerated epithelial repair response after fluid hydration during the acute phase of colitis, characterized by increased crypt proliferation, activation of ERK1/2, and modulation of TGF-β1 expression. Consistent with these findings, fluid-supplemented mice had increased numbers of goblet cells, upregulated expression of differentiation markers for absorptive enterocytes, and reduced inflammation during the recovery phase. Our results show that fluid hydration does not reduce stress in DSS-treated mice but alters colitis evolution by reducing clinical signs and accelerating epithelial repair. These results argue against the routine use of fluid supplementation in DSS-treated mice."
https://openalex.org/W2935757256,"This paper presents a fast two-stage image segmentation method for intensity inhomogeneous image using an energy function based on a local region-based active contour model with exponential family. In the first stage, we preliminary segment the down-sampled images by the local correntropy-based K-means clustering model with exponential family, which can fast obtain a coarse result with low computational complexity. Subsequently, by taking the up-sampled contour of the first stage as initialization, we precisely segment the original images by the improved local correntropy-based K-means clustering model with exponential family in the second stage. This stage can achieve accurate result rapidly as the result of the proper initialization. Meanwhile, we converge the energy function of two-stage by the Riemannian steepest descent method. Comparing with other statistical numerically methods, which are used to solve the partial differential equations(PDEs), this method can obtain the global minima with less iterations. Moreover, to promote regularity of energy function, we use a popular regular method which is an inner product and applies spatial smoothing to the gradient flow. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real images demonstrate that the proposed method is more efficient than the other state-of-art methods on intensity inhomogeneous images."
https://openalex.org/W2936190743,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease associated with synovial hyperplasia and bone and cartilage destruction. T cells, notably T helper (Th)-1 and Th17 cells, play a critical role in the pathologic process of RA. However, it remains unclear how Thl and Th17 cells are regulated during RA. In this study, we report that the small ubiquitin-like protein X-linked gene in the G6PD cluster at Xq28 (GdX) regulates the balance of Th17 and regulatory T (Treg) cells during collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). We discovered that the splenocytes of GdX-knockout (KO) mice were insensitive to T-cell stimulants. Correspondingly, GdX-KO mice showed alleviative Th1-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity and were resistant to CIA compared with wild-type mice. GdX-KO mice showed fewer swollen paws, lower serum proinflammatory cytokine and anti-collagen IgG levels, and decreased synovial hyperplasia. Mechanistically, we observed that deletion of GdX decreased the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and impaired the Th1 and Th17 differentiation but increased the Treg cell proliferation. Consistently, deletion of GdX decreased the transcription level of T-cell-specific T-box transcription factor and RAR-related orphan receptor-γ transcription factor but increased that of forkhead box P3 after being challenged with type-II collagen. These findings suggested that GdX functions as an important regulator of Th1 or Th17 and Treg cell balance during the inflammatory responses. Therefore, GdX may be a potential target for the therapy of RA.—Fu, Y., Liu, S., Wang, Y., Ren, F., Fan, X., Liang, J., Liu, C, Li, J., Ju, Y., Chang, Z.

https://openalex.org/W2936430728,"Aim Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is a predisposing factor of esophageal adenocarcinoma/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (ECA/GEJ Aca). BE patients are stratified and subsequently monitored according to the risk of malignant progression by the combination of endoscopy and biopsy. This study is to evaluate the maspin expression patterns as early diagnostic markers of malignancy in BE patients. Materials and methods Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was performed on 62 archival core biopsies from 35 patients, including BE without dysplasia (intestinal metaplasia, IM), BE with low grade dysplasia, BE with high grade dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, and well to poorly differentiated ECA/GEJ Aca (PD-ECA/GEJ Aca). The intensity and the subcellular distribution of immunoreactivity were evaluated microscopically. Statistical analysis was performed using the χ2 and Fisher exact tests. Results The level of epithelial-specific tumor suppressor maspin protein inversely correlated with the progression from IM to PD-ECA/GEJ Aca. Lesions of each pathological grade could be divided into subtypes that exhibited distinct maspin subcellular distribution patterns, including nuclear only (Nuc), combined nuclear and cytoplasmic (Nuc+Cyt), cytoplasmic only (Cyt) and overall negligible (Neg). The Cyt subtype, which was minor in both IM and dysplasia (approximately 10%), was predominant in ECA/GEJ Aca as early as well-differentiated lesions (more than 50%: p = 0.0092). In comparison, nuclear staining of the tumor suppressor TP53 was heterogeneous in dysplasia, and did not correlate with the differentiation grades of ECA/GEJ Aca. Conclusion The Cyt subtype of maspin expression pattern in core biopsies of BE patients may serve as a molecular marker for early diagnosis of ECA/GEJ Aca."
https://openalex.org/W2938960083,"There is currently much interest in developing general approaches for mapping forest aboveground carbon density using structural information contained in airborne LiDAR data. The most widely utilized model in tropical forests assumes that aboveground carbon density is a compound power function of top of canopy height (a metric easily derived from LiDAR), basal area and wood density. Here we derive the model in terms of the geometry of individual tree crowns within forest stands, showing how scaling exponents in the aboveground carbon density model arise from the height-diameter (H-D) and projected crown area-diameter (C-D) allometries of individual trees. We show that a power function relationship emerges when the C-D scaling exponent is close to 2, or when tree diameters follow a Weibull distribution (or other specific distributions) and are invariant across the landscape. In addition, basal area must be closely correlated with canopy height for the approach to work. The efficacy of the model was explored for a managed uneven-aged temperate forest in Ontario, Canada within which stands dominated by sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) and mixed stands were identified. A much poorer goodness-of-fit was obtained than previously reported for tropical forests (R2 = 0.29 vs. about 0.83). Explanations for the poor predictive power on the model include: (1) basal area was only weakly correlated with top canopy height; (2) tree size distributions varied considerably across the landscape; (3) the allometry exponents are affected by variation in species composition arising from timber management and soil conditions; and (4) the C-D allometric power function was far from 2 (1.28). We conclude that landscape heterogeneity in forest structure and tree allometry reduces the accuracy of general power-function models for predicting aboveground carbon density in managed forests. More studies in different forest types are needed to understand the situations in which power functions of LiDAR height are appropriate for modelling forest carbon stocks."

Here, we assessed the genetic diversity and demographic dynamics of Cameroon goat populations using mitochondrial DNA (two populations) and autosomal markers (four populations) generated with the Caprine 50K SNP chip. To infer genetic relationships at continental and global level, genotype data on six goat populations from Ethiopia and one population each from Egypt, Morocco, Iran, and China were included in the analysis. The mtDNA analysis revealed 83 haplotypes, all belonging to haplogroup A, in Cameroon goats. Four haplotypes were shared between goats found in Cameroon, Mozambique, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Kenya, and Ethiopia. Analysis of autosomal SNPs in Cameroon goats revealed the lowest HO (0.335±0.13) and HE (0.352±0.15) in the North-west Highland and Central Highland populations, respectively. Overall, the highest HO (0.401±0.12) and HE (0.422±0.12) were found for Barki and Iranian goats, respectively. Barki goats had the highest average MAF, while Central Highland Cameroon goats had the lowest. Overall, Cameroon goats demonstrated high FIS. AMOVA revealed that 13.29% of the variation was explained by genetic differences between the six population groups. Low average FST (0.01) suggests intermixing among Cameroon goats. All measures indicated that Cameroon goats are closer to Moroccan goats than to other goat populations. PCA and STRUCTURE analyses poorly differentiated the Cameroon goats, as did genetic distance, Neighbor-Net network, and neighbor-joining tree analyses. The haplotype analysis of mtDNA showed the initial dispersion of goats to Cameroon and central Africa from north-east Africa following the Nile Delta. Whereas, the approximate Bayesian computation indicated Cameroon goats were separated from Moroccan goats after 506 generations in later times (~1518 YA), as supported by the phylogenetic net-work and admixture outputs. Overall, indigenous goats in Cameroon show weak phylogenetic structure, suggesting either extensive intermixing."
https://openalex.org/W2937325875,"In developing an oral bait BCG vaccine against tuberculosis in badgers we wanted to understand the conditions of the gastrointestinal tract and their impact on vaccine viability. Conditions mimicking stomach and small-intestine caused substantial reduction in BCG viability. We performed in vivo experiments using a telemetric pH monitoring system and used the data to parameterise a dynamic in vitro system (TIM-1) of the stomach and small intestine. Some BCG died in the stomach compartment and through the duodenum and jejunum compartments. BCG survival in the stomach was greatest when bait was absent but by the time BCG reached the jejunum, BCG viability was not significantly affected by the presence of bait. Our data suggest that from a starting quantity of 2.85 ± 0.45 x 108 colony-forming units of BCG around 2 log10 may be killed before delivery to the intestinal lymphoid tissue. There are economic arguments for reducing the dose of BCG to vaccinate badgers orally. Our findings imply this could be achieved if we can protect BCG from the harsh environment of the stomach and duodenum. TIM-1 is a valuable, non-animal model with which to evaluate and optimise formulations to maximise BCG survival in the gastrointestinal tract."

The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of aniracetam (100mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) on short-term memory in ""neurologically healthy"" pigeons. Pigeons were administered aniracetam via either intramuscular injection or orally, either 30 or 60 minutes prior to testing on a delayed matching-to-sample task. Aniracetam had no effect on the pigeons' memory performance, nor did it affect response latency. These findings add to the growing evidence that, while effective at improving memory function in models of impaired memory, aniracetam has no effect in improving memory in healthy organisms."

This posttranscriptional addition of G−1 is performed by the tRNAHis guanylyltransferase (Thg1), which was first described in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and produces a non–Watson–Crick (non-WC) G−1:A73 bp as a result of this reaction (Fig. 1A) (16Gu W.

Shortly after the gene encoding Thg1 in S. cerevisiae was identified, it was demonstrated that this enzyme also performed Watson–Crick–templated 3′ to 5′ polymerase activity, in addition to the non-WC–dependent activity described initially (17Jackman J.E.

First, 5′ monophosphorylated tRNAHis, the product of RNase P cleavage, is activated via adenylylation using ATP.

These important catalytic roles are underscored by the very high (at or near 100%) conservation of these residues among representative eukaryotic Thg1 enzymes studied to date (22Jackman J.E. Phizicky E.M. Identification of critical residues for G−1 addition and substrate recognition by tRNAHis guanylyltransferase.Biochemistry. 2008; 47 (18366186): 4817-482510.1021/bi702517qCrossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, these biochemical studies also identified several catalytically essential residues that were similarly conserved, suggesting important roles, but for which specific functions in catalysis remained unknown. Residues His-152 and Lys-187 (hThg1 numbering) were among the most defective of these previously studied alanine variants, exhibiting no detectable ability to add G−1 to tRNAHis in vitro or in vivo (18Hyde S.J. Eckenroth B.E. Smith B.A. Eberley W.A. Heintz N.H. Jackman J.E.

Reflecting the important role of G−1 in specifying tRNAHis identity, eukaryotic Thg1 enzymes are strictly specific for tRNAHis, and this specificity is accomplished by recognition of the tRNAHis GUG anticodon (28Jackman J.E. Phizicky E.M. tRNAHis guanylyltransferase adds G−1 to the 5′ end of tRNAHis by recognition of the anticodon, one of several features unexpectedly shared with tRNA synthetases.RNA. 2006; 12 (16625026): 1007-101410.1261/rna.54706Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A crystal structure of Candida albicans Thg1 (CaThg1) bound to tRNAHis revealed a network of molecular interactions between the enzyme and the anticodon loop, consistent with the role of the anticodon nucleotides as the major identity element for eukaryotic Thg1. Interestingly, His-152 was featured in this network of Thg1 residues that directly interact with the anticodon, and residue Lys-187 was also located nearby (Fig. 1B) (23Nakamura A. Nemoto T. Heinemann I.U. Yamashita K. Sonoda T. Komoda K. Tanaka I. Söll D. Yao M. Structural basis of reverse nucleotide polymerization.Proc. Natl. Acad.

Thus, a model was proposed based on the location of these residues near the critical anticodon element. This model attributed the absence of G−1 addition activity with the alanine variants to disruption of the enzyme’s interaction with the anticodon leading to an inability to correctly position the tRNA 5′-end in the active site (23Nakamura A. Nemoto T. Heinemann I.U. Yamashita K. Sonoda T. Komoda K. Tanaka I. Söll D. Yao M. Structural basis of reverse nucleotide polymerization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2013; 110 (24324136): 20970-2097510.1073/pnas.1321312111Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis was not directly tested in any mechanistic assays. We sought to further investigate the molecular basis for the inactivity of alanine variants of His-152 and Lys-187 using chemical footprinting and kinetic assays. Here, we show that removal of either of these residues does not significantly diminish chemical protection of the anticodon nucleotides by the variant enzymes. Moreover, instead of being catalytically inactive as previously thought, we discovered that the H152A and K187A hThg1 variants exhibit robust 3′ to 5′ addition activity with tRNA variant substrates that have not been tested previously, but which allow WC-dependent nucleotide addition. Finally, we demonstrated that the inability of the alanine variants to catalyze the non-WC reaction to create the G−1:A73 bp results primarily from a defect in adenylylation, the first step of the 3′ to 5′ addition reaction (Fig. 1B). Together, these results suggest dual independent roles for His-152 and Lys-187 residues in the context of Thg1 catalysis and tRNA recognition and indicate that Thg1 utilizes independent WC and non-WC bp recognition sites involving distinct sets of residues. To probe the interaction of hThg1 with tRNAHis at single nucleotide resolution, we performed chemical footprinting with 1-cyclohexyl-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate (CMCT). CMCT was chosen because of its ability to modify the N-1 and N-3 positions of unpaired guanine and uracil residues, respectively, and G/U nucleotides make up six of the seven nucleotides within the tRNAHis anticodon loop. Positions of CMCT modification were identified as blocks to primer extension using a primer complementary to the 3′-end of the tRNA (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the expected tRNA structure, CMCT-dependent modification of the in vitro transcribed tRNAHis was readily detected in the anticodon and D-loops of the tRNA in the absence of protein (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1–3 versus 4–6). The location of the primer at the 3′-end prevented visualization of T-loop nucleotides. Modification by CMCT was then performed on the same tRNAHis substrate in the presence of 1 μm and 5 μm hThg1 (concentrations chosen according to the ∼1 μm KD,app,tRNA measured previously using kinetic assays) (19Smith B.A. Jackman J.E. Kinetic analysis of 3′-5′ nucleotide addition catalyzed by eukaryotic tRNAHis guanylyltransferase.Biochemistry. 2012; 51 (22136300): 453-46510.1021/bi201397fCrossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Protection from CMCT modification across the entire anticodon loop was observed with WT hThg1 in a concentration-dependent manner, consistent with previous structural and biochemical data suggesting the interaction between Thg1 and this part of the tRNA (Fig. 2B, lanes 10–15; Fig. S1). We then used this assay to test the role of His-152 and Lys-187 in maintaining the anticodon interaction that was previously hypothesized to be responsible for orienting the tRNA 5′-end in the active site for catalysis. Interestingly, both H152A and K187A variant enzymes display very similar patterns of CMCT protection to WT hThg1 (Fig. 2, C and D), with quantification also revealing statistically significant protection of anticodon nucleotides compared with the no Thg1 controls (Fig. 3). Moreover, no statistically significant differences were identified between the levels of protection observed for either of the variants at each anticodon loop position compared with WT hThg1. Filter-binding assays were used to determine apparent affinity for tRNAHis for each variant enzyme (Fig. S2; Table 1). The K187A variant exhibited a modest binding defect (about 5-fold) compared with WT consistent with this residue playing some role in overall tRNA binding, possibly through electrostatic interaction with the tRNA backbone. For H152A, the observed binding defect was more severe (∼25-fold compared with WT) which was again consistent with the previously observed interaction of this residue with tRNA (Table 1). Nonetheless, the ability of the H152A variant to significantly protect the anticodon nucleotides from chemical modification suggests that sufficient binding occurs under the conditions of the assays performed here. Taken together, these data indicate that the severe catalytic defects associated with H152A and K187A variants cannot be attributed simply to a loss of the overall anticodon interaction that causes subsequent misplacement of the tRNA 5′-end in the active site. Instead, the loss of activity may be because of other, possibly more direct, roles of His-152 and Lys-187 in catalysis.Table 1Biochemical characterization of human Thg1 variantshThg1H152AH152FK187Akobs ppp-tRNAHis (min−1) G−1:A73 (non-WC)0.0087 ± 0.0010.00048 ± 0.0004aObserved rate determined using the method of linear initial rates.0.0026 ± 0.0007aObserved rate determined using the method of linear initial rates.0.0026 ± 0.0006aObserved rate determined using the method of linear initial rates.

Open table in a new tab Thg1 is a homotetramer that binds to two tRNA substrates. In the complex, the two tRNA molecules are bound asymmetrically, with the anticodon end of each tRNA in one monomer, and the 5′-end (site of G−1 addition) located in another monomer (Fig. 1B) (18Hyde S.J.

Thus, the possibility of nonequivalent roles for residues derived from different monomers was considered. Indeed, His-152 and Lys-187 residues found in the two subunits that do not interact with the anticodon end of the tRNA are located relatively near the G−1 addition site, although the lack of interpretable electron density for tRNA nucleotides at the active site prevents observation of any direct contacts between these residues and the bound tRNA. Previous studies demonstrated that alteration of His-152 and Lys-187 to alanine causes complete loss of G−1 addition activity with WT tRNAHis, yet no available structural information helps to rationalize whether either of these residues plays a direct role in the chemistry of nucleotide addition, possibly in addition to its interaction with the bound tRNA. For all previous studies testing the ability of hThg1 variants to catalyze G−1 addition, the WT tRNAHis that contains an A73 discriminator nucleotide was used as the substrate in these assays (22Jackman J.E. Phizicky E.M. Identification of critical residues for G−1 addition and substrate recognition by tRNAHis guanylyltransferase.Biochemistry. 2008; 47 (18366186): 4817-482510.1021/bi702517qCrossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Nakamura A.

However, an alternative substrate that contains a C73 discriminator nucleotide has also been utilized extensively in other studies, because of the ability of Thg1 enzymes to act as a “reverse polymerase” and incorporate multiple Watson–Crick base paired nucleotides into this substrate (17Jackman J.E.

We sought to revisit the effects of alterations at His-152 and Lys-187 by testing the WC-dependent addition activity with the C73-tRNAHis substrate, which had not been tested previously. For these assays, 5′-end labeled substrate was incubated with varied concentrations of hThg1 enzyme in the presence of ATP and GTP. After quenching reactions with EDTA and RNase A (which cleaves at the site of the red arrow shown in Fig. 4), reactions were subsequently treated with phosphatase. The use of phosphatase exploits the difference in accessibility of the labeled 5′-phosphate in unreacted substrate versus in nucleotide addition products where the labeled phosphate is protected from phosphatase removal. Thus, labeled oligonucleotide fragments corresponding to reaction products can be resolved from labeled Pi by TLC (Fig. 4A) (28Jackman J.E.

It was from the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF-GRFP), which offers a coveted award: 3 years of relatively generous funding and a healthy dose of prestige. My hopes were high. The previous year, when I applied as an undergraduate student with little mentoring, I had received an honorable mention. Now I was a first-year Ph.D. student, with a publication and a university fellowship to my name. The six people I had asked for input about my application—two of them actual reviewers for the fellowship—had given me positive feedback. I felt the key to career success was within my grasp."
https://openalex.org/W2938203357,"Studies have reported an association between low levels of natural immunoglobulin M antibodies against phosphorylcholine(IgM anti-PC) and worse prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The aims of the present study were, in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI); 1) to compare serum levels of IgM anti-PC measured acutely and after 3 months; 2) to study an association between levels of IgM anti-PC and the severity ofCAD, and; 3) to investigate whether IgM anti-PC levels are associated with long-term clinical outcome.A total of 213 patients without known diabetes (median age 59 years) with a PCI treated STEMI were enrolled. IgM anti-PC was measured in-hospital and after 3 months. Median follow-up time was 6.5 years (all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial re-infarction, recurrent ischemia causing hospital admission, heart failure and stroke). The severity of CAD was evaluated by coronary angiograms and patients were classified as having single- or multi-vessel disease and by SYNTAX score (SXscore).IgM anti-PC levels were stable over time when measured acutely and after 3 months. Patients with multi-vessel disease and high SXscore had significantly lower levels of IgM anti-PC in the acute phase of STEMI. Low levels of IgM anti-PC (the 25 percentile) measured acutely were associated with a 2-fold increase in the odds of having multi-vessel disease (adjusted OR 2.28 (95% CI 1.17, 4.44), p = 0.016), but not with high SXscore (Crude OR 2.20 (95% CI 0.96, 5.07), p = 0.06). Fifty-three patients experienced a new clinical event during long-term follow-up. Low levels of IgM anti PC were not associated with worse prognosis, (crude HR 1.54 (0.87-2.76), p = 0.14).STEMI patients with multi-vessel disease or high SXscore had significantly lower levels of IgM anti-PC in the acute phase and low levels were associated with multi-vessel disease, but not with worse clinical outcome during long-term follow-up."
