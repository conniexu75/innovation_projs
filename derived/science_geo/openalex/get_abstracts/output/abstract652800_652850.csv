https://openalex.org/W3025744748,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly emerged coronavirus that is responsible for the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has resulted in more than 3.7 million infections and 260,000 deaths as of 6 May 20201,2. Vaccine and therapeutic discovery efforts are paramount to curb the pandemic spread of this zoonotic virus. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein promotes entry into host cells and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we describe several monoclonal antibodies that target the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, which we identified from memory B cells of an individual who was infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003. One antibody (named S309) potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2, by engaging the receptor-binding domain of the S glycoprotein. Using cryo-electron microscopy and binding assays, we show that S309 recognizes an epitope containing a glycan that is conserved within the Sarbecovirus subgenus, without competing with receptor attachment. Antibody cocktails that include S309 in combination with other antibodies that we identified further enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, and may limit the emergence of neutralization-escape mutants. These results pave the way for using S309 and antibody cocktails containing S309 for prophylaxis in individuals at a high risk of exposure or as a post-exposure therapy to limit or treat severe disease. The monoclonal antibody S309, identified from memory B cells of an individual infected with SARS-CoV in 2003, or antibody cocktails that contain this antibody potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2."

Here, we report the rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies by high-throughput single-cell RNA and VDJ sequencing of antigen-enriched B cells from 60 convalescent patients. From 8,558 antigen-binding IgG1+ clonotypes, 14 potent neutralizing antibodies were identified, with the most potent one, BD-368-2, exhibiting an IC50 of 1.2 and 15 ng/mL against pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2, respectively. BD-368-2 also displayed strong therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy in SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2-transgenic mice. Additionally, the 3.8 Å cryo-EM structure of a neutralizing antibody in complex with the spike-ectodomain trimer revealed the antibody’s epitope overlaps with the ACE2 binding site. Moreover, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies could be directly selected based on similarities of their predicted CDR3H structures to those of SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies. Altogether, we showed that human neutralizing antibodies could be efficiently discovered by high-throughput single B cell sequencing in response to pandemic infectious diseases."

However, this test can take up to 2 d to complete, serial testing may be required to rule out the possibility of false negative results and there is currently a shortage of RT-PCR test kits, underscoring the urgent need for alternative methods for rapid and accurate diagnosis of patients with COVID-19. Chest computed tomography (CT) is a valuable component in the evaluation of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, CT alone may have limited negative predictive value for ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection, as some patients may have normal radiological findings at early stages of the disease. In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate chest CT findings with clinical symptoms, exposure history and laboratory testing to rapidly diagnose patients who are positive for COVID-19. Among a total of 905 patients tested by real-time RT-PCR assay and next-generation sequencing RT-PCR, 419 (46.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a test set of 279 patients, the AI system achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 and had equal sensitivity as compared to a senior thoracic radiologist. The AI system also improved the detection of patients who were positive for COVID-19 via RT-PCR who presented with normal CT scans, correctly identifying 17 of 25 (68%) patients, whereas radiologists classified all of these patients as COVID-19 negative. When CT scans and associated clinical history are available, the proposed AI system can help to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 patients."

Because of a shortage of dermatologists, most cases are seen instead by general practitioners with lower diagnostic accuracy. We present a deep learning system (DLS) to provide a differential diagnosis of skin conditions using 16,114 de-identified cases (photographs and clinical data) from a teledermatology practice serving 17 sites. The DLS distinguishes between 26 common skin conditions, representing 80% of cases seen in primary care, while also providing a secondary prediction covering 419 skin conditions. On 963 validation cases, where a rotating panel of three board-certified dermatologists defined the reference standard, the DLS was non-inferior to six other dermatologists and superior to six primary care physicians (PCPs) and six nurse practitioners (NPs) (top-1 accuracy: 0.66 DLS, 0.63 dermatologists, 0.44 PCPs and 0.40 NPs). These results highlight the potential of the DLS to assist general practitioners in diagnosing skin conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3025654679,"CORONAVIRUS In some quarters, it is hoped that increased humidity and higher temperatures over the Northern Hemisphere in the summer will snuff out the 2020 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. In reality, the situation is likely to be more complicated than that. Baker et al. used a climate-dependent epidemic model to simulate the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, testing different scenarios of climate dependence based on known coronavirus biology. Levels of susceptibility among the population remain the driving factor for the pandemic, and without effective control measures, the pandemic will persist in the coming months, causing severe outbreaks even in humid climates. Summer will not substantially limit pandemic growth. Science this issue p. 315"
https://openalex.org/W3024627825,"Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related deaths, but the natural history, clonal evolution and impact of treatment are poorly understood. We analyzed whole-exome sequencing (WES) data from 457 paired primary tumor and metastatic samples from 136 patients with breast, colorectal and lung cancer, including untreated (n = 99) and treated (n = 100) metastases. Treated metastases often harbored private ‘driver’ mutations, whereas untreated metastases did not, suggesting that treatment promotes clonal evolution. Polyclonal seeding was common in untreated lymph node metastases (n = 17 out of 29, 59%) and distant metastases (n = 20 out of 70, 29%), but less frequent in treated distant metastases (n = 9 out of 94, 10%). The low number of metastasis-private clonal mutations is consistent with early metastatic seeding, which we estimated occurred 2–4 years before diagnosis across these cancers. Furthermore, these data suggest that the natural course of metastasis is selectively relaxed relative to early tumorigenesis and that metastasis-private mutations are not drivers of cancer spread but instead associated with drug resistance. Analysis of whole-exome sequencing data from paired primary tumors and metastases from patients with breast, colorectal and lung cancer identifies clonal remodeling associated with therapy and few metastasis-private clonal mutations, consistent with early metastatic seeding."
https://openalex.org/W3024605887,"Oligodendrocyte loss in neurological disease leaves axons vulnerable to damage and degeneration, and activity-dependent myelination may represent an endogenous mechanism to improve remyelination following injury. Here we report that, while learning a forelimb reach task transiently suppresses oligodendrogenesis, it subsequently increases oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation, oligodendrocyte generation and myelin sheath remodeling in the forelimb motor cortex. Immediately following demyelination, neurons exhibit hyperexcitability, learning is impaired and behavioral intervention provides no benefit to remyelination. However, partial remyelination restores neuronal and behavioral function, allowing learning to enhance oligodendrogenesis, remyelination of denuded axons and the ability of surviving oligodendrocytes to generate new myelin sheaths. Previously considered controversial, we show that sheath generation by mature oligodendrocytes is not only possible but also increases myelin pattern preservation following demyelination, thus presenting a new target for therapeutic interventions. Together, our findings demonstrate that precisely timed motor learning improves recovery from demyelinating injury via enhanced remyelination from new and surviving oligodendrocytes. Precisely timed motor learning promotes remyelination in the motor cortex by enhancing oligodendrogenesis and stimulating mature oligodendrocytes to generate new myelin, presenting mature oligodendrocytes as new targets in remyelinating therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3025047014,"Disease variants identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) tend to overlap with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), but it remains unclear whether this overlap is driven by gene expression levels ‘mediating’ genetic effects on disease. Here, we introduce a new method, mediated expression score regression (MESC), to estimate disease heritability mediated by the cis genetic component of gene expression levels. We applied MESC to GWAS summary statistics for 42 traits (average N = 323,000) and cis-eQTL summary statistics for 48 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium. Averaging across traits, only 11 ± 2% of heritability was mediated by assayed gene expression levels. Expression-mediated heritability was enriched in genes with evidence of selective constraint and genes with disease-appropriate annotations. Our results demonstrate that assayed bulk tissue eQTLs, although disease relevant, cannot explain the majority of disease heritability. Mediated expression score regression (MESC) is a new method that estimates disease heritability mediated by the cis genetic component of gene expression levels by using summary statistics from GWAS and eQTL studies."
https://openalex.org/W3023998086,"Progression to exudative 'wet' age-related macular degeneration (exAMD) is a major cause of visual deterioration. In patients diagnosed with exAMD in one eye, we introduce an artificial intelligence (AI) system to predict progression to exAMD in the second eye. By combining models based on three-dimensional (3D) optical coherence tomography images and corresponding automatic tissue maps, our system predicts conversion to exAMD within a clinically actionable 6-month time window, achieving a per-volumetric-scan sensitivity of 80% at 55% specificity, and 34% sensitivity at 90% specificity. This level of performance corresponds to true positives in 78% and 41% of individual eyes, and false positives in 56% and 17% of individual eyes at the high sensitivity and high specificity points, respectively. Moreover, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can identify anatomical changes before conversion and high-risk subgroups. This AI system overcomes substantial interobserver variability in expert predictions, performing better than five out of six experts, and demonstrates the potential of using AI to predict disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W3024591577,"Cas9 is commonly introduced into cell lines to enable CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing. Here, we studied the genetic and transcriptional consequences of Cas9 expression itself. Gene expression profiling of 165 pairs of human cancer cell lines and their Cas9-expressing derivatives revealed upregulation of the p53 pathway upon introduction of Cas9, specifically in wild-type TP53 (TP53-WT) cell lines. This was confirmed at the messenger RNA and protein levels. Moreover, elevated levels of DNA repair were observed in Cas9-expressing cell lines. Genetic characterization of 42 cell line pairs showed that introduction of Cas9 can lead to the emergence and expansion of p53-inactivating mutations. This was confirmed by competition experiments in isogenic TP53-WT and TP53-null (TP53-/-) cell lines. Lastly, Cas9 was less active in TP53-WT than in TP53-mutant cell lines, and Cas9-induced p53 pathway activation affected cellular sensitivity to both genetic and chemical perturbations. These findings may have broad implications for the proper use of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing."
https://openalex.org/W3024208464,"With very large sample sizes, biobanks provide an exciting opportunity to identify genetic components of complex traits. To analyze rare variants, region-based multiple-variant aggregate tests are commonly used to increase power for association tests. However, because of the substantial computational cost, existing region-based tests cannot analyze hundreds of thousands of samples while accounting for confounders such as population stratification and sample relatedness. Here we propose a scalable generalized mixed-model region-based association test, SAIGE-GENE, that is applicable to exome-wide and genome-wide region-based analysis for hundreds of thousands of samples and can account for unbalanced case–control ratios for binary traits. Through extensive simulation studies and analysis of the HUNT study with 69,716 Norwegian samples and the UK Biobank data with 408,910 White British samples, we show that SAIGE-GENE can efficiently analyze large-sample data (N > 400,000) with type I error rates well controlled. SAIGE-GENE is a scalable generalized mixed-model region-based association test that can analyze large datasets while accounting for sample relatedness and unbalanced case–control ratios for binary traits."
https://openalex.org/W3025298198,"During aging, progenitor cells acquire mutations, which may generate clones that colonize the surrounding tissue. By middle age, normal human tissues, including the esophageal epithelium (EE), become a patchwork of mutant clones. Despite their relevance for understanding aging and cancer, the processes that underpin mutational selection in normal tissues remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated this issue in the esophageal epithelium of mutagen-treated mice. Deep sequencing identified numerous mutant clones with multiple genes under positive selection, including Notch1, Notch2 and Trp53, which are also selected in human esophageal epithelium. Transgenic lineage tracing revealed strong clonal competition that evolved over time. Clone dynamics were consistent with a simple model in which the proliferative advantage conferred by positively selected mutations depends on the nature of the neighboring cells. When clones with similar competitive fitness collide, mutant cell fate reverts towards homeostasis, a constraint that explains how selection operates in normal-appearing epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W3024181690,"General anesthesia (GA) can produce analgesia (loss of pain) independent of inducing loss of consciousness, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that GA suppresses pain in part by activating supraspinal analgesic circuits. We discovered a distinct population of GABAergic neurons activated by GA in the mouse central amygdala (CeAGA neurons). In vivo calcium imaging revealed that different GA drugs activate a shared ensemble of CeAGA neurons. CeAGA neurons also possess basal activity that mostly reflects animals’ internal state rather than external stimuli. Optogenetic activation of CeAGA potently suppressed both pain-elicited reflexive and self-recuperating behaviors across sensory modalities and abolished neuropathic pain-induced mechanical (hyper-)sensitivity. Conversely, inhibition of CeAGA activity exacerbated pain, produced strong aversion and canceled the analgesic effect of low-dose ketamine. CeAGA neurons have widespread inhibitory projections to many affective pain-processing centers. Our study points to CeAGA as a potential powerful therapeutic target for alleviating chronic pain. Hua and Chen et al. show that general anesthesia activates a distinct population of central amygdala neurons and that these neurons can potently suppress pain responses through their widespread projections to many pain-processing centers in the brain."

We performed proteomic sequencing of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in 438 older individuals and found associations between cerebral atherosclerosis and reduced synaptic signaling and between RNA splicing and increased oligodendrocyte development and myelination. Consistently, single-cell RNA sequencing showed cerebral atherosclerosis associated with higher oligodendrocyte abundance. A subset of proteins and modules associated with cerebral atherosclerosis was also associated with Alzheimer's disease, suggesting shared mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3025520651,"Acquired therapy resistance is a major problem for anticancer treatment, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Using an established breast cancer cellular model, we show that endocrine resistance is associated with enhanced phenotypic plasticity, indicated by a general downregulation of luminal/epithelial differentiation markers and upregulation of basal/mesenchymal invasive markers. Consistently, similar gene expression changes are found in clinical breast tumours and patient-derived xenograft samples that are resistant to endocrine therapies. Mechanistically, the differential interactions between oestrogen receptor α and other oncogenic transcription factors, exemplified by GATA3 and AP1, drive global enhancer gain/loss reprogramming, profoundly altering breast cancer transcriptional programs. Our functional studies in multiple culture and xenograft models reveal a coordinated role of GATA3 and AP1 in re-organizing enhancer landscapes and regulating cancer phenotypes. Collectively, our study suggests that differential high-order assemblies of transcription factors on enhancers trigger genome-wide enhancer reprogramming, resulting in transcriptional transitions that promote tumour phenotypic plasticity and therapy resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3024051456,"Experiential diversity promotes well-being in animal models. Here, using geolocation tracking, experience sampling and neuroimaging, we found that daily variability in physical location was associated with increased positive affect in humans. This effect was stronger for individuals who exhibited greater functional coupling of the hippocampus and striatum. These results link diversity in real-world daily experiences to fluctuations in positive affect and identify a hippocampal–striatal circuit associated with this bidirectional relationship. Greater novelty and diversity in one’s daily physical environment is associated with positive affect, and functional connectivity within a hippocampal–striatal circuit is related to the strength of this effect."

https://openalex.org/W3025637034,"The medical, public health, and scientific communities are grappling with monumental imperatives to contain COVID-19, develop effective vaccines, identify efficacious treatments for the infection and its complications, and find biomarkers that detect patients at risk of severe disease. The focus of this communication is on a potential biomarker, short telomere length (TL), that might serve to identify patients more likely to die from the SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of age. The common thread linking these patients is lymphopenia, which largely reflects a decline in the numbers of CD4/CD8 T cells but not B cells. These findings are consistent with data that lymphocyte TL dynamics impose a limit on T-cell proliferation. They suggest that T-cell lymphopoiesis might stall in individuals with short TL who are infected with SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W3017924655,"Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum remains the leading single-agent cause of mortality in children1, yet the promise of an effective vaccine has not been fulfilled. Here, using our previously described differential screening method to analyse the proteome of blood-stage P. falciparum parasites2, we identify P. falciparum glutamic-acid-rich protein (PfGARP) as a parasite antigen that is recognized by antibodies in the plasma of children who are relatively resistant-but not those who are susceptible-to malaria caused by P. falciparum. PfGARP is a parasite antigen of 80 kDa that is expressed on the exofacial surface of erythrocytes infected by early-to-late-trophozoite-stage parasites. We demonstrate that antibodies against PfGARP kill trophozoite-infected erythrocytes in culture by inducing programmed cell death in the parasites, and that vaccinating non-human primates with PfGARP partially protects against a challenge with P. falciparum. Furthermore, our longitudinal cohort studies showed that, compared to individuals who had naturally occurring anti-PfGARP antibodies, Tanzanian children without anti-PfGARP antibodies had a 2.5-fold-higher risk of severe malaria and Kenyan adolescents and adults without these antibodies had a twofold-higher parasite density. By killing trophozoite-infected erythrocytes, PfGARP could synergize with other vaccines that target parasite invasion of hepatocytes or the invasion of and egress from erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W3024853822,"Objectives Financial health, understood as one’s ability to manage expenses, prepare for and recover from financial shocks, have minimal debt, and ability to build wealth, underlies all facets of daily living such as securing food and paying for housing, yet there is inconsistency in measurement and definition of this critical concept. Most social determinants research and interventions focus on siloed solutions (housing, food, utilities) rather than on a root solution such as financial health. In light of the paucity of public health research on financial health, particularly among low-income populations, this study seeks to: 1) introduce the construct of financial health into the domain of public health as a useful root term that underlies other individual measures of economic hardship and 2) demonstrate through outcomes on financial, physical and mental health among low-income caregivers of young children that the construct of financial health belongs in the canon of social determinants of health. Materials and methods In order to extract features of financial health relevant to overall well-being, principal components analysis were used to assess survey data on banking and personal finances among caregivers of young children who participate in public assistance. Then, a series of logistic regressions were utilized to examine the relationship between components of financial health, depression and self-rated health. Results Components aligned with other measures of financial health in the literature, and there were strong associations between financial health and health outcomes. Practice implications Financial health can be conceived of and measured as a key social determinant of health."

https://openalex.org/W3024966060,"Income inequality is blamed for being the main driver of violent crime by the majority of the literature. However, earlier work on the topic largely neglects the role of poverty and income levels as opposed to income inequality. The current paper uses all court verdicts for homicide cases in China between 2014 and 2016, as well as various inequality measures calculated from 2005 mini census data together with a host of control variables to shed light on the relationship at the detailed Chinese prefecture-level. The results suggest that it is the poverty and low income level, rather than income inequality, that is positively related to homicide rates. We show that the internal rural-urban migration from more violent localities contributes to the destination cities' homicide rates. The poverty-homicide association implies that instead of ""relative deprivation"", ""absolute deprivation"" is mainly responsible for violent crime.

https://openalex.org/W3024188829,"Here we generate fluorescence resonance energy transfer biosensors for guanine exchange factors (GEFs) by inserting a fluorescent protein pair in a structural ‘hinge’ common to many GEFs. Fluorescent biosensors can map the activation of signaling molecules in space and time, but it has not been possible to quantify how different activation events affect one another or contribute to a specific cell behavior. By imaging the GEF biosensors in the same cells as red-shifted biosensors of Rho GTPases, we can apply partial correlation analysis to parse out the extent to which each GEF contributes to the activation of a specific GTPase in regulating cell movement. Through analysis of spontaneous cell protrusion events, we identify when and where the GEF Asef regulates the GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 to control cell edge dynamics. This approach exemplifies a powerful means to elucidate the real-time connectivity of signal transduction networks. Biosensors of guanine exchange factors (GEFs) and red-shifted GTPase biosensors are used to visualize GEF and GTPase activities in the same cells and enable correlation analysis to reveal which GEF–GTPase interactions regulate cell movement."
https://openalex.org/W3024229463,"Core self-evaluation (CSE) is a theory that includes four personality dimensions: self-esteem, self-efficacy, locus of control and emotional stability. CSE proved to be a significant predictor of the research on cognitive, emotional and behavioral responses across various situations in the workplace. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between personality traits of the core self-evaluation and clinical decision-making in nurses’ profession. A cross-sectional design was applied. Data was collected with standardized instruments: Core Self-Evaluation Scale and Clinical Decision-Making Nurses Scale, 584 nurses have participated in the study. Correlation and hierarchical regression analysis were used to test the relations and prediction of variables. The findings of the study revealed that there is a significant positive relationship between overall core self-evaluation and nurses’ clinical decision-making, and there is a significant contribution of self-esteem, self-efficacy and locus of control on all dimensions of clinical decision, especially in the area of canvassing of objectives and values. Nurses with high CSE have positive self-views and tend to be confident in their ability and they also feel in control while performing nursing interventions, whereas those with low CSE tend to have fewer accessible positive resources and are more prone to risk aversion."
https://openalex.org/W3024972089,"MYB-related transcription factors play important roles in plant development and response to various environmental stresses. In the present study, a novel MYB gene, designated as BnMYB2 (GenBank accession number: MF741319.1), was isolated from Boehmeria nivea using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and RT-PCR on a sequence fragment from a ramie transcriptome. BnMYB2 has a 945 bp open reading frame encoding a 314 amino acid protein that contains a DNA-binding domain and shares high sequence identity with MYB proteins from other plant species. The BnMYB2 promoter contains several putative cis-acting elements involved in stress or phytohormone responses. A translational fusion of BnMYB2 with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) showed nuclear and cytosolic subcellular localization. Real-time PCR results indicated that BnMYB2 expression was induced by Cadmium (Cd) stress. Overexpression of BnMYB2 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in a significant increase of Cd tolerance and accumulation. Thus, BnMYB2 positively regulated Cd tolerance and accumulation in Arabidopsis, and could be used to enhance the efficiency of Cd removal with plants."
https://openalex.org/W3024499198,"Background Meta-analyses on impact of isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis informed the World Health Organization recommendation of a levofloxacin-strengthened rifampicin-based regimen. We estimated the effect of initial rifampicin resistance (Rr) and/or isoniazid resistance (Hr) on treatment failure or relapse. We also determined the frequency of missed initial and acquired Rr to estimate the impact of true Hr. Methods Retrospective analysis of 7291 treatment episodes with known initial isoniazid and rifampicin status obtained from individual patient databases maintained by the Damien Foundation Bangladesh over 20 years. Drug susceptibility test results were confirmed by the programme’s designated supra-national tuberculosis laboratory. To detect missed Rr among isolates routinely classified as Hr, rpoB gene sequencing was done randomly and on a sample selected for suspected missed Rr. Results Initial Hr caused a large recurrence excess after the 8-month regimen for new cases (rifampicin for two months), but had little impact on rifampicin-throughout regimens: (6 months, new cases; 3.8%; OR 0.8, 95%CI:0.3,2.8; 8 months, retreatment cases: 7.3%, OR 1.8; 95%CI:1.3,2.6). Rr was missed in 7.6% of randomly selected ""Hr"" strains. Acquired Rr was frequent among recurrences on rifampicin-throughout regimens, particularly after the retreatment regimen (31.9%). It was higher in mono-Hr (29.3%; aOR 3.5, 95%CI:1.5,8.5) and poly-Hr (53.3%; aOR 10.2, 95%CI 4.4,23.7) than in susceptible tuberculosis, but virtually absent after the 8-month new case regimen. Comparing Bangladesh (low Rr prevalence) with a high Rr prevalence setting,true Hr corrected for missed Rr caused only 2–3 treatment failures per 1000 TB cases (of whom 27% were retreatments) in both. Conclusions Our analysis reveals a non-negligible extent of misclassifying as isoniazid resistance of what is actually missed multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Recommending for such cases a “strengthened” regimen containing a fluoroquinolone provokes a direct route to extensive resistance while offering little benefit against the minor role of true Hr tuberculosis in rifampicin-throughout first-line regimen."
https://openalex.org/W3024777007,"Background Female Genital Cutting (FGC) is a traditionally meaningful practice in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. It is associated with a high risk of long-term physical and psychosexual health problems. Girls and women with FGC-related health problems need specialized healthcare services such as psychosexual counseling, deinfibulation, and clitoral reconstruction. Moreover, the need for psychosexual counseling increases in countries of immigration where FGC is not accepted and possibly stigmatized. In these countries, the practice loses its cultural meaning and girls and women with FGC are more likely to report psychosexual problems. In Norway, a country of immigration, psychosexual counseling is lacking. To decide whether to provide this and/or other services, it is important to explore the intention of the target population to use FGC-related healthcare services. That is as deinfibulation, an already available service, is underutilized. In this article, we explore whether girls and women with FGC intend to use FGC-related healthcare services, regardless of their availability in Norway. Methods We conducted 61 in-depth interviews with 26 Somali and Sudanese participants with FGC in Norway. We then validated our findings in three focus group discussions with additional 17 participants. Findings We found that most of our participants were positive towards psychosexual counseling and would use it if available. We also identified four cultural scenarios with different sets of sexual norms that centered on getting and/or staying married, and which largely influenced the participants’ intention to use FGC-related services. These cultural scenarios are the virgin, the passive-, the conditioned active-, and the equal- sexual partner scenarios. Participants with negative attitudes towards the use of almost all of the FGC-related healthcare services were influenced by a set of norms pertaining to virginity and passive sexual behavior. In contrast, participants with positive attitudes towards the use of all of these same services were influenced by another set of norms pertaining to sexual and gender equality. On the other hand, participants with positive attitudes towards the use of services that can help to improve their marital sexual lives, yet negative towards the use of premarital services were influenced by a third set of norms that combined norms from the two aforementioned sets of norms. Conclusion The intention to use FGC-related healthcare services varies between and within the different ethnic groups. Moreover, the same girl or woman can have different attitudes towards the use of the different FGC-related healthcare services or even towards the same services at the different stages of her life. These insights could prove valuable for Norwegian and other policy-makers and healthcare professionals during the planning and/or delivery of FGC-related healthcare services."
https://openalex.org/W3025280256,"The Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test suffers from low specificity for the diagnosis of Prostate Cancer (PCa). We originally discovered two cancer-related proteins thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) and cathepsin D (CTSD) using a mass-spectrometry-based proteomics approach. The two serum proteins were shown to improve the diagnosis of high-grade PCa. Thus, we developed quantitative ELISAs for the determination of their concentration in human serum. Here we report their analytical performance in terms of limit of detection, specificity, precision, linearity and interferences, which were determined based on CLSI guidelines. Further, we investigated the influence of pre-analytical factors on concentration measurements. For this, blood from 4–6 donors was collected in different tubes and stored at room temperature for different times prior to centrifugation at different centrifugal forces and temperatures. Stability of THBS1 and CTSD under different storage temperatures was also evaluated. Our results show that the assays are specific, linear and sensitive enough to allow measurement of clinical samples. Precision in terms of repeatability and total within-laboratory coefficient of variation (CV) are 5.5% and 8.1% for THBS1 and 4.3% and 7.2% for CTSD, respectively. Relative laboratory-to-laboratory differences were -6.3% for THBS1 and -3% for CTSD. Both THBS1 and CTSD were stable in serum samples, with 80–120% recoveries of concentrations across donors, sample preparation and storage. In conclusion, the ELISAs as part of the novel commercial in vitro diagnostic test Proclarix are suitable for the use in clinical practice. THBS1 and CTSD can be accurately measured for their intended use independent of the lot and laboratory when conditions consistent with routine practice for PSA sampling and storage are used."
https://openalex.org/W3026667977,"As a core driving force of the most recent round of industrial transformation, artificial intelligence has triggered significant changes in the world economic structure, profoundly changed our life and way of thinking, and achieved an overall leap in social productivity. This paper aims to examine the effect of knowledge transfer performance on the artificial intelligence industry innovation network and the path artificial intelligence enterprises can take to promote sustainable development through knowledge transfer in the above context. First, we construct a theoretical hypothesis and conceptual model of the innovation network knowledge transfer mechanism within the artificial intelligence industry. Then, we collect data from questionnaires distributed to Chinese artificial intelligence enterprises that participate in the innovation network. Moreover, we empirically analyze the impact of innovation network characteristics, organizational distance, knowledge transfer characteristics, and knowledge receiver characteristics on knowledge transfer performance and verify the hypotheses proposed in the conceptual model. The results indicate that innovation network centrality and organizational culture distance have a significant effect on knowledge transfer performance, with influencing factors including network scale, implicit knowledge transfer, receiver’s willingness to receive, and receiver’s capacity to absorb knowledge.

https://openalex.org/W3027120036,"Complex skin wounds have always been a significant health and economic problem worldwide due to their elusive and sometimes poor or non-healing conditions. If not well-treated, such wounds may lead to amputation, infections, cancer, or even death. Thus, there is a need to efficiently generate multifunctional skin grafts that address a wide range of skin conditions, including non-healing wounds, and enable the regeneration of new skin tissue. Here, we propose studying pristine graphene and two of its oxygen-functionalized derivatives-high and low-oxygen graphene films-as potential substrates for skin cell proliferation and differentiation. Using BJ cells (human foreskin-derived fibroblasts) to represent basic skin cells, we show that the changes in surface properties of pristine graphene due to oxygen functionalization do not seem to statistically impact the normal proliferation and maturation of skin cells. Our results indicate that the pristine and oxidized graphenes presented relatively low cytotoxicity to BJ fibroblasts and, in fact, support their growth and bioactivity. Therefore, these graphene films could potentially be integrated into more complex skin regenerative systems to support skin regeneration. Because graphene's surface can be relatively easily functionalized with various chemical groups, this finding presents a major opportunity for the development of various composite materials that can act as active components in regenerative applications such as skin regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3026315561,"The Mdm4 (alias MdmX) oncoprotein, like its paralogue and interaction partner Mdm2, antagonizes the tumor suppressor p53. p53-independent roles of the Mdm proteins are emerging, and we have reported the ability of Mdm2 to modify chromatin and to support DNA replication by suppressing the formation of R-loops (DNA/RNA-hybrids). We show here that the depletion of Mdm4 in p53-deficient cells compromises DNA replication fork progression as well. Among various deletion mutants, only full-length Mdm4 was able to support DNA replication fork progression. Co-depletion of Mdm4 and Mdm2 further impaired DNA replication, and the overexpression of each partially compensated for the other’s loss. Despite impairing replication, Mdm4 depletion only marginally hindered cell proliferation, likely due to compensation through increased firing of replication origins. However, depleting Mdm4 sensitized p53−/− cells to the nucleoside analog gemcitabine, raising the future perspective of using Mdm4 inhibitors as chemosensitizers. Mechanistically, Mdm4 interacts with members of the Polycomb Repressor Complexes and supports the ubiquitination of H2A, thereby preventing the accumulation of DNA/RNA-hybrids. Thus, in analogy to previously reported activities of Mdm2, Mdm4 enables unperturbed DNA replication through the avoidance of R-loops."

No effective vaccine against C. perfringens is currently available. Using an antiserum screen of mutants generated from a C. perfringens transposon-mutant library, here we identified an immunoreactive antigen that was lost in a putative glycosyltransferase mutant, suggesting that this antigen is likely a glycoconjugate. Following injection of formalin-fixed whole cells of C. perfringens HN13 (a laboratory strain) and JGS4143 (chicken isolate) intramuscularly into chickens, the HN13-derived antiserum was cross-reactive in immunoblots with all tested 32 field isolates, whereas only 5 of 32 isolates were recognized by JGS4143-derived antiserum. The immunoreactive antigens from both HN13 and JGS4143 were isolated, and structural analysis by MALDI-TOF-MS, GC-MS, and 2D NMR revealed that both were atypical lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) with poly-(β1→4)-ManNAc backbones substituted with phosphoethanolamine. However, although the ManNAc residues in JGS4143 LTA were phosphoethanolamine-modified, a few of these residues were instead modified with phosphoglycerol in the HN13 LTA.

Despite the importance of C. perfringens in a livestock context and the identification of capsular polysaccharide (CPS) as the primary antigenic determinant of the Hobbs typing scheme (23Hughes J.

Only the CPS structures from C. perfringens Hobbs 5, 9, and 10 have been examined in any detail, with the Hobbs 9 CPS determined to be comprised of Glc, Gal, and galactosamine in a 1:1.6:1.1 ratio in 1977 (24Cherniak R.

In addition to CPS structures, many Gram-positive bacteria produce cell wall teichoic acids and lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), but little information is available about the presence or importance of these or other carbohydrate structures in C. perfringens. Indeed, Richter et al. (27Richter S.G. Elli D. Kim H.K. Hendrickx A.P. Sorg J.A. Schneewind O. Missiakas D. Small molecule inhibitor of lipoteichoic acid synthesis is an antibiotic for Gram-positive bacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, direct evidence for the presence of LTA in this species has only recently been demonstrated by Vinogradov et al. (28Vinogradov E. Aubry A. Logan S. Structural characterization of wall and lipidated polysaccharides from Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124.Carbohydr. Res. 2017; 448 (28628892): 88-9410.1016/j.carres.2017.06.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), who reported that C. perfringens ATCC 13124 produces an LTA with a repeating structure of β-ManNAc6PEtN-(1→4)-[β-ManNAc6PEtN-(1→4)]-β-ManNAc-(1→4)-β-ManNAc6PEtN[3-α-Ribf]-(1→4)-β-ManN-(1→4)-β-Glc-(1→1)-Gro. There are no known polysaccharide-based vaccines against C. perfringens. Vaccination strategies to date have centered on the use of protein antigens, such as detoxified versions of toxins produced by C. perfringens (toxoids) and C. perfringens surface and secreted proteins, resulting in varying degrees of protection (29Mot D. Timbermont L. Haesebrouck F. Ducatelle R. Van Immerseel F. Progress and problems in vaccination against necrotic enteritis in broiler chickens.Avian Pathol. 2014; 43 (24980518): 290-30010.1080/03079457.2014.939942Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, because of the production of more than one toxin by C. perfringens strains causing livestock diseases, including NE in chickens, effective protein vaccine strategies may require multivalent vaccines. Commercially available C. perfringens vaccines for poultry (Netvax®) and Clostridium toxoid autovaccine (Vacci-VetTM) are based on α-toxin toxoids, but the toxin NetB has recently been shown to play a more pivotal role in C. perfringens pathology in chickens. Moreover, a recent NE vaccine study found that significant protection levels were only observed when a combination of α-toxin– and NetB–derived antigens were used (30Jiang Y. Mo H. Willingham C. Wang S. Park J. Kong W. Roland K. Curtiss R. Protection against necrotic enteritis in broiler chickens by regulated delayed lysis Salmonella vaccines.Avian Dis. 2015; 59 (26629620): 475-48510.1637/11094-041715-RegCrossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). One of the major considerations in the development of an NE vaccine is that it must be inexpensive to produce, and multivalent vaccines may prove to be cost-prohibitive for use in poultry because of the low market value of chickens. Therefore, there still remains a need to identify a conserved, immunogenic target molecule from C. perfringens that elicits a broadly cross-reactive immune response to be used as the primary antigen in a safe and effective vaccine against NE in chickens, other livestock diseases, and human food-poisoning caused by C. perfringens. In this study, we have identified an atypical LTA produced by C. perfringens HN13 that dominates the immune response of both rabbits and chickens against bacterial whole cells and have demonstrated that serum raised against this LTA is broadly cross-reactive, recognizing all 32 C. perfringens field isolates tested, provides passive protection to chicks, and promotes killing of C. perfringens in an opsonophagocytosis assay. Combined, these results suggest that this LTA is an ideal candidate antigen for glycoconjugate or live-cell surface-display–based NE vaccines. To identify any immunostimulatory antigens common to C. perfringens, whole-cell lysates of three strains, C. perfringens HN13 (a derivative of strain 13, Table S6), JGS4143, and SM101, were analyzed by Western immunoblotting before and after treatment with lysozyme and/or proteinase K using rabbit antiserum raised against formalin-treated whole cells of C. perfringens strain 13 (Fig. S1). Prior to enzymatic treatment, the lysates for all three strains contained a large immunoreactive “smear,” as well as a few discrete immunoreactive bands, and lysozyme treatment did not alter the profile of the samples. Treatment with proteinase K resulted in the loss of the discreet bands, but the immunoreactive “smear” remained, indicating that the majority of the immune response was directed to a nonproteinaceous antigen. Western immunoblotting analysis was subsequently performed on whole-cell lysates of four putative glycosyltransferase mutants isolated from a C. perfringens HN13 transposon library (31Liu H. Bouillaut L. Sonenshein A. Melville S. Use of a mariner-based transposon mutagenesis system to isolate Clostridium perfringens mutants deficient in gliding motility.J. Bacteriol. 2013; 195 (23204460): 629-63610.1128/JB.01288-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and lysates from the cpe2071 mutant (strain HLL8) no longer showed the proteinase K–resistant antigen observed in the WT strain (Fig. 1) or in negatively stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. S2). The Western blot signal was restored by complementation of cpe2071. Conserved Domain Database analysis (32Marchler-Bauer A. Anderson J. DeWeese-Scott C. Fedorova N. Geer L. He S. Hurwitz D.

PgaC is involved in the biosynthesis of the highly conserved immunogenic carbohydrate poly-β-1,6-GlcNAc expressed by many bacterial, fungal, and eukaryotic pathogens (34Skurnik D. Cywes-Bentley C.

To determine the level of conservation of the identified immunoreactive antigen among C. perfringens strains, dot-blot analysis was performed on proteinase K–treated whole-cell lysates from 32 C. perfringens field isolates of differing sequence types (37Chalmers G.

Microbiol. 2008; 46 (18945840): 3957-396410.1128/JCM.01548-08Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), using rabbit α-C. perfringens HN13 antiserum adsorbed against the C. perfringens HN13 cpe2071 mutant. In the resultant dot blot (Fig. S3), all field isolate lysates, as well as the WT strain lysate, were immunoreactive. However, the C. perfringens HN13 cpe2071 mutant lysate was not recognized by the antiserum, indicating that the identified immunoreactive antigen is present in all of the field isolates tested. Additionally, the same immunoreactive antigen was detected in the chicken isolate C. perfringens JGS4143 by Western immunoblotting (Fig. S3). In contrast, lysates from three representative strains of Clostridium cochleatum, Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium symbiosum showed no reactivity by Western immunoblotting analysis with the same antiserum (Fig. S4), indicating that the conserved C. perfringens antigen is not present in these strains and likely not conserved among other Clostridium species. To determine whether the conserved C. perfringens antigen dominates the immune response in chickens, antisera against formalin-fixed whole cells of C. perfringens HN13 and C. perfringens JGS4143 were generated, and Western immunoblotting analyses were performed to compare the reactivity of adsorbed rabbit and chicken α-C. perfringens HN13 antisera, as well as the unadsorbed α-C. perfringens JGS4143 antisera against lysates from all 32 C. perfringens field isolates. The JGS4143 and HN13 WT (positive controls) and the HN13 cpe2071 mutant (negative control) strains were also included (Fig. 2). For both the rabbit and chicken antisera raised against C. perfringens HN13, all of the field isolates showed reactivity similar to HN13 and JGS4143, indicating that these strains produce a similar or closely related immunoreactive antigen compared with C. perfringens HN13. Note that reactivity consistent with the glycan of interest was observed in field isolates from both NE and healthy chickens, as well as from equine NE (JP55) and canine hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (JP838) isolates, which indicates that the glycoconjugate is present on isolates of C. perfringens irrespective of the host species or the disease state of the host animals. In contrast, the chicken antiserum raised against C. perfringens JGS4143 was reactive with both the HN13 and JGS4143 lysate controls but reactive with only five of the field isolates, with three isolates (isolates 20, 21, and 149) showing moderate reactivity and a further two field isolates (isolates 10 and 11) only faintly reactive. Thus, it appears the surface polysaccharide antigen from C. perfringens HN13 is either broadly conserved or has one or more epitopes that elicit a broadly cross-reactive immune response, whereas the surface polysaccharide antigen from C. perfringens JGS4143 elicits an immune response that is far less cross-reactive with exemplary field isolates of C. perfringens. To determine the nature of the conserved surface antigens from C. perfringens and gain insight into the differences between the antigens from C. perfringens strains HN13 and JGS4143, the conserved antigens from each of these strains were purified from 10-liter fermenter cultures by sequential fractionation using boiling, lysozyme treatment, phenol-hot water extraction, and ultracentrifugation steps. The conserved surface antigens fractionated to the phenol phase and preferentially to the ultracentrifugation pellet of the phenol phase based on dot-blot analysis of the fractions (Fig. S5). These purified antigens were first tested for reactivity with α-HN13 antiserum (Fig. S6), and the purified HN13 antigen was used to affinity purify antibodies directed at that antigen from α-HN13 antiserum; the resultant purified antibodies showed similar reactivity patterns as observed with the adsorbed α-HN13 antiserum, indicating that the observed reactivities with that adsorbed serum correspond to the antigen of interest (Fig. S7). The purified antigens from HN13 and JGS4143 were then structurally characterized through a combination of MALDI-TOF-MS, GC-MS, and 1D/2D NMR experiments. The composition of the glycolipids isolated from the two strains was determined by combined GC-MS of per-O-TMS derivatives of the monosaccharide methyl glycosides. Glycosyl composition analysis showed that the HN13 polysaccharide contained Gro, Glc, traces of N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) and fatty acids: C20, C18, C16, and C14. The JG4143 polysaccharide contained ribose, Glc, traces of ManNAc, and fatty acids: C20, C18, and C16. As shown and described below, the major glycosyl residue in the glycolipid after treatment with aqueous hydrofluoric acid (HF) is ManNAc, indicating that the ManNAc residues are extensively substituted by phosphate or substituent groups linked to ManNAc via phosphate. The HN13 LTA preparation was deacylated (i.e. delipidated) and separated into high- and low-molecular-weight (HMW and LMW) delipidated LTA by Bio-Gel P6 chromatography. Initial structural analysis was performed on the HMW material using 1D/2D NMR spectroscopy; proton, HSQC, COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY experiments. This allowed assignment of the proton and carbon chemical shifts and also determination of their linkages, sugar sequence, as well as identification and determination of substitution positions of substituent groups. The chemical shift assignments for the HMW deacylated LTA are given in Table S1. The 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 3, top panel) contained a major anomeric signal at δ 4.87 (residue A), which overlapped with minor signals of δ ∼4.85 (residue B) and δ 4.89 (residue B′). Of these minor signals, the one at δ 4.85 seemed to be the more intense. Further assignments for these residues could be made for all protons and carbons of residue A, B1, and B2 protons and carbons, and B′1 proton and carbon. The signals for A and B were consistent with both being β-ManpNAc residues as indicated by their respective downfield H-2 chemical shifts, δ 4.61 and δ 4.58, and C-2 chemical shifts at δ 54.0 and 54.1 (Fig. 3, middle and bottom panels). A high-field signal at δ 2.06 was also observed that is due to the NAc groups attached to C-2 of the ManNAc residues that dominate this polysaccharide (see further description below). Residue B′ was also likely a ManNAc because this is by far the major glycosyl component in this sample (the identities of B and B′ are described further below with regard to the delipidated LMW LTA fraction). The strong intraresidue A1,3 and A1,5 NOE correlations (Fig. 3, middle panel) confirm the β-configuration of the ManNAc residues. Intense signals at δ 4.11 and 3.23 were consistent with PEtN substituents, and the intensity of these signals indicated that PEtN was a major component of the polysaccharide. The NMR experiments also supported the presence or PGro as two primary protons were observed at δ 3.86 and 3.91, which coupled to a secondary proton at δ 3.94 which, in turn was coupled to two primary protons at δ 3.60 and 3.66. The respective corresponding carbon resonances were at δ 67.6, 71.7 and 63.4 (Fig. 3, bottom panel). The intensities of PEtN resonances in the proton spectrum were greater than any of the glycosyl residue or PGro resonances (Fig. 3, top panel), indicating that the polysaccharide contains significantly greater levels of PEtN than PGro. The ∼2/1 ratio of the PEtN H-2 protons to the A1 + B′1 + B1 protons also indicates that the vast majority of the ManNAc residues are substituted by PEtN groups. Sequence information was obtained from the NOESY experiment in which we observed strong A4/A1 NOE contacts (Fig. 3, middle panel). These are likely inter-residue rather than intraresidue contacts because the opposing di-axial positions of the intraresidue A1 and A4 protons in a β-(1,4)-linked ManNAc residue would not be expected to have NOE contacts. The downfield A4 carbon chemical shift of the ManNAc residues (δ 77.9) also supports that they are linked at this position. The remaining chemical shifts for residues B and B′ were not possible to assign because their resonances were of low intensity and likely overlap with those of residue A. An A6/A1 NOE contact was also observed, which is likely due to inter-residue interaction between adjacent A residues because an intraresidue A1,6 NOE would not be expected. Thus, these data indicate that the HMW deacylated LTA consists largely of a β-(1,4)-ManNAc polysaccharide, which, because of the downfield c"

Hence, to continuously extract and deliver the maximum possible power from the PV system, under given meteorological conditions, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control strategy needs to be formulated that continuously operates the PV system at its MPP. To achieve this goal, a hybrid nonlinear, very fast and efficient MPPT control strategy, based on the robust integral backstepping (RIB) control, is formulated in this research article. The simulation testbed comprises a standalone PV array, a non-inverting buck-boost (NIBB) DC-DC power converter, a purely resistive and a dynamic load (sound system). The proposed MPPT control scheme consists of two loops, where the first loop generates the real-time offline reference peak power voltage through an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) network, which is then utilized in the second loop as a set-point value for generating a control signal and then forcing the PV system to be operated at this set-point by continuously adjusting the duty ratio of the power converter. This control strategy exhibits no overshoot, fast convergence, good transient response, fast rising and settling times and minimum output tracking error. The MATLAB/Simulink platform is used to test the performance of the proposed MPPT strategy against varying meteorological conditions, plant current and voltage faults and plant parametric uncertainties. To validate the superiority of the proposed control strategy, a comparative analysis of the proposed control strategy is presented with the nonlinear backstepping (B), integral backstepping controller (IB) and conventional PID and P&O based MPPT controllers."

In this work, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of the flavonoid Naringenin. Five-month-old B6.MRL-Faslpr/J lupus-prone mice were administered daily orally with Naringenin for seven months. We showed that Naringenin treatment at 50 or 100 mg/kg inhibited the splenomegaly and decreased the levels of anti-nuclear and anti-dsDNA autoantibodies. Furthermore, a reduction in serum concentration of TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-6 was observed in the mice provided with Naringenin. Interestingly, serum levels of IL-10 increased. Naringenin decreased the frequency and absolute numbers of splenic effector memory T cells. Additionally, in order to be able to evaluate whether Naringenin prevented kidney damage, twelve-week-old MRL/MpJ-Faslpr/J mice, an accelerated lupus model, were orally administered with Naringenin at 100 mg/kg for six weeks. Surprisingly, Naringenin treatment prevented kidney damage and reduced the development of fibrosis similar to cyclophosphamide group. Moreover, Naringenin treatment increased the percentage of regulatory T cells in this aggressive model of lupus. Together, these results suggest a potential ability of Naringenin to reduce the autoimmunity in lupus-prone mice by modulation of T-cell subsets and cytokines profile that mitigate the development of important lupus clinical manifestations."
https://openalex.org/W3026165501,"Objectives Tape measurement is a commonly used method in the clinical assessment of lymphedema. However, few studies have assessed the precision and reliability of tape measurement in assessing head and neck lymphedema. This study aimed to evaluate the reliability and precision of using tape measurement, performed by different evaluators, for the assessment of head and neck lymphedema. Methods This study was conducted at a tertiary care cancer hospital. Between January and December 2019, 50 patients with head and neck cancers and 50 normal subjects were enrolled. Each subject was examined using tape measurements for 7 point-to-point distances of facial landmarks, 3 circumferences of the neck (upper, middle, and lower), and 2 circumferences of the face (vertical and oblique) by 3 random examiners. Test precision and reliability were assessed with the within-subject standard deviation (Sw) and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), respectively. Results Overall, the standard deviation of the tape measurements varied in the range of 4.6 mm to 18.3 mm. The measurement of distance between the tragus and mouth angle (Sw: 4.6 mm) yielded the highest precision, but the reliability (ICC: 0.66) was moderate. The reliabilities of neck circumference measurements (ICC: 0.90–0.95) were good to excellent, but the precisions (Sw: 8.3–12.3 mm) were lower than those of point-to-point facial measurements (Sw: 4.6–8.8 mm). Conclusions The different methods of tape measurements varied in precision and reliability. Thus, clinicians should not rely on a single measurement when evaluating head and neck lymphedema."
https://openalex.org/W3026328925,"Human leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRs) typically regulate immune activation by binding to the human leukocyte antigen class I molecules. LILRA2, a member of the LILR family, was recently reported to bind to other unique ligands, the bacterially degraded Igs (N-truncated Igs), for the activation of immune cells. Therefore, LILRA2 is currently attracting significant attention as a novel innate immune receptor. However, the detailed recognition mechanisms required for this interaction remain unclear. In this study, using several biophysical techniques, we uncovered the molecular mechanism of N-truncated Ig recognition by LILRA2. Surface plasmon resonance analysis disclosed that LILRA2 specifically binds to N-truncated Ig with weak affinity (Kd = 4.8 μm) and fast kinetics. However, immobilized LILRA2 exhibited a significantly enhanced interaction with N-truncated Ig due to avidity effects. This suggests that cell surface-bound LILRA2 rapidly monitors and identifies bi- or multivalent abnormal N-truncated Igs through specific cross-linking to induce immune activation. Van’t Hoff analysis revealed that this interaction is enthalpy-driven, with a small entropy loss, and results from differential scanning calorimetry indicated the instability of the putative LILRA2-binding site, the Fab region of the N-truncated Ig. Atomic force microscopy revealed that N truncation does not cause significant structural changes in Ig. Furthermore, mutagenesis analysis identified the hydrophobic region of LILRA2 domain 2 as the N-truncated Ig-binding site, representing a novel ligand-binding site for the LILR family.

Leukocyte immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptors (LILRs or LIRs), also known as Ig-like transcripts (ILTs) or the CD85 family, are expressed on the surface of immune cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (1Kuroki K.

LILRs belong to a paired receptor family that has homologous extracellular domains but opposite intracellular signaling motifs. The extracellular domains of most LILRs are composed of four Ig-like domains (D1, D2, D3, and D4). LILRBs (LILRB1, -B2, -B3, -B4, and -B5) have an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM).

In contrast, LILRAs (LILRA1, -A2, -A4, -A5, and -A6) have a positively charged Arg residue in the transmembrane domain, which facilitates coupling with molecules harboring the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), such as the FcRγ chain. The activating receptor LILRA1 binds to HLA-B27, which is a well-known factor for diseases like ankylosing spondylitis (8Allen R.L. Raine T. Haude A. Trowsdale J. Wilson M.J.

The cleaved Igs were found in L. pneumophilia-infected mice and pus fluid from S. pneumoniae-infected patients (14Hirayasu K. Saito F. Suenaga T. Shida K. Arase N. Oikawa K. Yamaoka T. Murota H.

Therefore, the cleavage of Igs is considered a highly conserved immune evasion mechanism for bacteria (14Hirayasu K. Saito F. Suenaga T. Shida K. Arase N. Oikawa K. Yamaoka T. Murota H. Chibana H.

In contrast, Hirayasu et al. also found that LILRA2 ingeniously bound to the cleaved Igs and stimulated the immune system to inhibit bacterial growth. For example, the growth of L. pneumophila was inhibited by stimulating primary monocytes with LILRA2 (14Hirayasu K. Saito F. Suenaga T. Shida K. Arase N. Oikawa K. Yamaoka T. Murota H. Chibana H.

This is a novel immune activation mechanism for sensing immune evasion by bacteria; however, the detailed molecular recognition mechanism remains unknown. Here, we report the biophysical characteristics of the interaction between LILRA2 and N-truncated Ig. We purified WT LILRA2 and N-truncated Ig and determined the binding affinity, kinetics, and thermodynamic characteristics of the LILRA2/N-truncated Ig interaction using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Furthermore, we identified the N-truncated Ig binding site on LILRA2 using mutagenesis studies. We also observed N-truncated Ig and full-length Ig structure by high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). These results provided important molecular insights into microbially cleaved Ig recognition by LILRA2 as well as strategies for suitable regulation of host immune systems. The constructs used for the expression of proteins in this study are summarized in Fig. 1, A and B, and Fig. S1A. The N-terminal domains 1 and 2 (D1D2) of the extracellular region of human LILRA2 receptor (residues 1–195, here designated LILRA2D1D2) were expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies and refolded in vitro by a dilution method (4Shiroishi M.

The refolded LILRA2D1D2 was purified by size exclusion chromatography and eluted as a monomer based on analysis using calibration standards (Fig. S1B). SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the protein obtained was highly purified and suitable for further experiments (Fig. S1C). The domains 1 to 4 (D1D4) of the extracellular region of LILRA2 (residues 1–409, here designated LILRA2D1D4) was fused to a His tag and expressed in HEK293S GnTI(−) cells. The recombinant protein was purified by Ni-affinity chromatography. The subsequent size exclusion chromatogram showed that LILRA2D1D4 also eluted as a monomer (Fig. S1, D and E). Previous reports showed an unusual refolding of the LILRA2 mutant (R142C) forming a domain-swapped dimer (16Chen Y. Chu F. Gao F. Zhou B. Gao G.F.

LILRA2 D1D4 fused with the Fc region (residues 1–409 of LILRA2 fused with Fc, here designated Fc fusion LILRA2D1D4) was transiently expressed by HEK293T cells as a secreted protein, as described previously (14Hirayasu K.

The protein was purified from the culture supernatant by protein G affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography. Full-length Ig (amino acid residues 1–495 of heavy chain and amino acid residues 1–217 of light chain) and N-truncated Ig (corresponding to amino acid residues 106–495 of the heavy chain of full-length IgG3 and amino acid residues 1–217 of the light chain) were also expressed and purified by the same method as the Fc fusion LILRA2D1D4 described above. The purity of the protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. S1F). SPR analysis was performed to elucidate the molecular recognition mechanism of LILRA2 by N-truncated Ig, using the purified recombinant proteins obtained above. Soluble LILRA2D1D2 protein was injected onto a CM5 sensor chip where N-truncated Ig or full-length Ig (as a negative control) was directly immobilized by the amine coupling method. Specific binding of LILRA2 to N-truncated Ig was observed but not to the full-length Ig (Fig. 1C). LILRB2D1D2 did not show specific binding to N-truncated Ig by SPR analysis, despite having a sequence similarity of almost 79% to LILRA2D1D2 (Fig. 1D). This result was consistent with previous flow cytometric analysis, which indicated that Fc-LILRB2 did not bind to N-truncated Ig, using the coexpression system with CD79α/β on HEK293T cells (14Hirayasu K.

Microbiol. 2016; 1 (27572839): 1605410.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.54Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We injected LILRA2D1D2 (from 0.16 μm to 40 μm) or LILRA2D1D4 (from 0.12 μm to 15 μm) to N-truncated and full-length Igs immobilized on the chip to determine the dissociation constants (Kd) by equilibrium binding analysis (Fig. 1, E–H). The dissociation constants of the interaction between LILRA2D1D2 or LILRA2D1D4 and N-truncated Ig were determined to be 4.83 ± 0.05 μm and 12.7 ± 0.3 μm, respectively. These data indicate that D1-D2 domains, not D3-D4 domains, of LILRA2 play a pivotal role in the N-truncated Ig binding. LILRA2D1D2 (0.63, 1.3, and 2.5 μm) was injected onto an N-truncated Ig immobilized chip to determine the kinetic parameters by global fitting analysis, using a 1:1 Langmuir binding model (Fig. 1I). The association and dissociation rate constants were 1.1 ± 0.0 (105 M−1·s−1) and 0.23 ± 0.00 (s−1), respectively. The Kd derived from the kinetic parameters was 2.0 ± 0.0 μm. Similar Kd values obtained from the kinetic and equilibrium analysis provide further evidence of the accuracy of these kinetic parameters. Antibodies typically have two or more antigen binding sites and, therefore, demonstrate strong binding potential against antigens expressed on the cell surface due to an avidity effect. The N-truncated Ig presumably has two potential receptor binding sites and, thus, may also exhibit the avidity effect on LILRA2 expressed on the cell surface. To examine this avidity effect, N-truncated Ig was injected onto the LILRA2D1D2 immobilized sensor chip. It showed a slower dissociation sensorgram than the opposite orientation (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, to verify the slow dissociation in solution, mixtures of either LILRA2D1D2 (one ligand binding site) or Fc fusion LILRA2D1D4 (two ligand binding sites) and N-truncated Ig were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography. The size exclusion chromatogram of the mixture of LILRA2D1D2 and N-truncated Ig showed separate elution peaks for each component protein, while that of Fc fusion LILRA2D1D4 and N-truncated Ig showed an earlier elution peak, which was not observed for each component protein (Fig. 2B). SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that this peak contained Fc fusion LILRA2D1D4 and N-truncated Ig (Fig. 2C). These data indicated that N-truncated Ig has two LILRA2 binding sites and a significant avidity effect for LILRA2 binding. We investigated the thermal stability of N-truncated Ig by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis to further understand its thermodynamic properties (Fig. 3A). Deconvolution analysis of the N-truncated Ig shows two peaks, with melting temperatures (Tms) of 57.8 and 66.3 °C. To clarify the assignment of these transitions, DSC analysis of the full-length Ig was also performed (Fig. 3B). It showed two major peaks, with Tms of 69.0 and 73.5 °C, corresponding to the unfolding temperatures of Fc and Fab, respectively, as previously described by Garber et al. (18Garber E. Demarest S.J. A broad range of Fab stabilities within a host of therapeutic IgGs.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 355 (17321501): 751-75710.1016/j.bbrc.2007.02.042Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Since the N-truncated Ig was purified by protein G affinity chromatography, the Fc portion of the N-truncated Ig presumably has a structure similar to that of full-length Ig. Therefore, the Tm of 66.3 °C in N-truncated Ig was assigned to the unfolding temperature of the Fc of N-truncated Ig. The other Tm of 57.8 °C in N-truncated Ig was assigned to the unfolding temperature of the truncated Fab of N-truncated Ig. The Tms of N-truncated Ig, especially that of the truncated Fab, were lower than that of full-length Ig, suggesting that Fab truncation reduces the stability of N-truncated Ig, especially affecting the stability of the Fab region. We performed van’t Hoff analysis using the Kd determined by SPR, at different temperatures (10–30 °C), to further clarify the thermodynamic aspect of this interaction. The binding enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (ΔS), and heat capacity (ΔCp) were determined by using the nonlinear van’t Hoff equation as described in the Experimental procedures (Fig. 3C). −TΔS was found to be 0.85 ± 0.03 kcal·mol−1 and ΔH was −8.2 ± 0.0 kcal·mol−1, indicating that this interaction is enthalpically driven with a slight entropy loss at 25 °C (Fig. 3D and Table S1). ΔCp was calculated as −0.56 ± 0.02 kcal·mol−1·K−1 (Fig. 3D and Table S1). High-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) was utilized to examine the structural features of N-truncated Ig. AFM images of full-length Igs in Fig. 3E and Fig. S2 show that full-length Ig exhibits two representative images, Y-shaped (flat-on) and dumbbell-like (side-on) structures. The Fab and Fc regions are relatively distant (the average distance is 21 ± 3 nm, mean ± S.D., n = 10) compared with IgG1 structures previously reported (19Umakoshi T. Udaka H. Uchihashi T. Ando T. Suzuki M. Fukuda T. Quantum-dot antibody conjugation visualized at the single-molecule scale with high-speed atomic force microscopy.Colloids Surf. B Biointerfaces. 2018; 167 (29677598): 267-27410.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.04.015Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Moreover, Movie S1 shows that the connection between Fab and Fc regions (two or three spots) of Ig particles are highly mobile, while the longest distances are 26 nm. Since the full-length Ig is IgG3 type and has a long linker region, these structural and dynamic features are reasonable for IgG3-type antibodies. On the other hand, N-truncated Ig (Fig. 3F, Fig. S3, and Movie S2) exhibited Y-shaped and dumbbell-like structures with highly mobile features, similar to full-length Ig (the average distance is 20 ± 4 nm, mean ± S.D., n = 10). These results indicate that N truncation does not cause any significant changes in overall structure and that the movement of Fab is independent of that of the Fc region (Fig. 3, E and F, Fig. S2 and S3, and Movies S1 and S2). We designed LILRA2 mutants based on a comparison of the primary sequence of LILRA2 and group 1 LILRs to determine the N-truncated Ig binding site on LILRA2 (Fig. 4A). Unique residues in LILRA2 with completely conserved corresponding amino acid residues in other group 1 LILRs were identified to prepare Q31E, E33Q, N41K, R48T, P53L, G54V, L112S, R142S, and W154R mutants (Fig. S4). We also focused on residues that are not universally conserved among group 1 LILRs and constructed the following LILRA2D1D2 mutants: I50_Q51insR/Q51P, H73G/Y85L, and H79R/N80A/H81R/S82W (Fig. S4). CD spectra of all mutants were generally similar to that of the WT protein (Fig. S5). SPR analysis of LILRA2 mutants showed that all domain 1 mutants (Q31E, E33Q, N41K, R48T, P53L, G54V, I50_Q51insR/Q51P, H73G/Y85L, and H79R/N80A/H81R/S82W) and two domain 2 mutants (L112S and R142S) bound to the N-truncated Ig with Kd similar to that of the WT. However, one domain 2 mutant, W154R, did not bind to the N-truncated Ig (Fig. 4B, Fig. S6, S7, and S8A, Table 1, and Table S2). These results suggest that the region surrounding Trp154 on LILRA2 domain 2 is involved in N-truncated Ig binding. We constructed an LILRA2D1-LILRB2D2 chimeric protein to test this hypothesis (Fig. S4). CD spectra of the chimera were similar to that of the WT protein (Fig. S5). SPR analysis showed that the chimeric protein does not bind to the N-truncated Ig (Fig. 4B). More LILRA2 mutants (V121E, D127G, H146Q, S147P, and W152S) were designed to further clarify the N-truncated Ig binding region surrounding Trp154, based on the structures of the LILR family members and prepared by the refolding method. SPR analysis showed that LILRA2 D127G, H146Q, and S147P bound to N-truncated Ig but LILRA2 V121E and W152S did not (Fig. S8B). Mapping of these residues on the LILRB2 structure (PDB entry 2GW5) showed that these residues are located on the same surface of domain 2 (Fig. 4C). Based on the mutagenesis study, we propose a model of the LILRA2/N-truncated Ig complex (Fig. 4D).Table 1Summary of binding affinities (Kd) of LILRA2 mutants for N-truncated immunoglobulinsaNumbers of experiments are shown as n.

Open table in a new tab In this study, we performed kinetic analysis using SPR to reveal the mechanistic details of the interaction between LILRA2 and N-truncated Ig. LILRA2 binds to N-truncated Ig with a relatively fast association rate constant (1.1 × 105 M−1·s−1) and dissociation rate constant (0.23 s−1) compared with those of general protein–protein interactions, suggesting that LILRA2 can rapidly detect N-truncated Ig in blood. The weak affinity of LILRA2/N-truncated Ig interaction (Kd of ∼4.8 μm) is typically observed in interactions which control cell–cell recognition (Table S3). A strong avidity effect was observed in SPR when N-truncated Ig was injected onto an LILRA2 immobilized chip (Fig. 2A). In addition, the size exclusion chromatogram of the mixture of Fc fusion LILRA2D1D4 and N-truncated Ig showed an earlier elution peak, which contained the Fc fusion LILRA2D1D4 and N-truncated Ig, whereas that of LILRA2D1D2 and N-truncated Ig showed separate elution peaks for each component protein (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that LILRA2 binds to N-truncated Ig strongly by avidity effect. The avidity effect is observed in other ITAM/ITIM-harboring molecules, such as FcαR and LILRB1 and -B2 (20Herr A.B.

We propose that the dimerization, which occurs by cross-linking upon the binding of N-truncated Ig, triggers immune activation through LILRA2.

In the present study, a representative population of 185 soybean accessions was selected and utilized to identify the quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN) of partial resistance to soybean SSR via a genome-wide association study (GWAS). A total of 22,048 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minor allele frequencies (MAF) > 5% and missing data < 3% were used to assess linkage disequilibrium (LD) levels. Association signals associated with SSR partial resistance were identified by two models, including compressed mixed linear model (CMLM) and multi-locus random-SNP-effect mixed linear model (mrMLM). Finally, seven QTNs with major effects (a known locus and six novel loci) via CMLM and nine novel QTNs with minor effects via mrMLM were detected in relation to partial resistance to SSR, respectively. One of all the novel loci (Gm05:14834789 on Chr.05), which was co-located by these two methods, might be a stable one that showed high significance in SSR partial resistance. Additionally, a total of 71 major and 85 minor candidate genes located in the 200-kb genomic region of each peak SNP detected by CMLM and mrMLM were found, respectively. By using a gene-based association, a total of six SNPs from three major effects genes and eight SNPs from four minor effects genes were identified. Of them, Glyma.18G012200 has been characterized as a significant element in controlling fungal disease in plants."

All patients underwent either phacoemulsification or manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS). Pre and postoperative uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were recorded at one day, 1-3 weeks and 4-11 weeks. Main outcome measure was BCVA at 4-11 weeks; Intraoperative complications and preoperative ocular comorbidities (POC) were noted. BCVA less than 6/12 was classified as visual impairment (VI). Risk factor for VI was analysed using the logistic regression model.Of the 573 patients, 288 were males and 285 were females (49.7%). Mean age was 65.9±10.9 years; 14.3% had POC. The surgical technique was mainly MSICS (94.59%, n = 542). At 4-11 weeks, good outcome of 6/12 or better was noted in 38.55% (UCVA) and 82.54% (BCVA). Visual acuity (VA) of 6/18 or better as UCVA and BCVA was noted in 63.5% and 88% eyes respectively. Poor outcome of less than 6/60 was noted as UCVA (11.11%) and BCVA (5.22%).

https://openalex.org/W3026627073,"Background Group-based trajectory modeling is a useful tool for categorizing students’ academic trajectories and their determinants. Using insights gained from the analyses, we can identify students at risk for poor academic performance and monitor them to provide support. To date, studies investigating the associations between demographic factors and academic performance trajectories among medical students are scarce. The study objective was to examine the associations between demographic factors and academic performance trajectories in medical students using group-based trajectory modeling. Methods Participants included all medical students admitted to Tokyo Medical and Dental University in Japan in 2013 and 2014 (n = 202). Academic performance was evaluated by biannual grade point average (GPA) scores in preclinical years. We used group-based trajectory modeling to categorize students into GPA trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the association between the odds of being in a certain GPA trajectory group and demographic factors such as high school type, high school geographical area, admission test type, high school graduation year, whether the student was a biology major, and sex. Results Students’ GPA trajectories were classified into four trajectory groups as well as another group that consisted of students who withdrew or repeated years. We found that students whose high school geographical area was outside the National Capital Region were 7.2 times more likely to withdraw or repeat years in comparison with students whose school was inside the National Capital Region (OR: 7.21, 95% CI: 1.87, 27.76). In addition, admission test type, high school graduation year, and sex were associated with GPA trajectories. Conclusions High school geographical area, admission test type, high school graduation year, and sex were associated with GPA trajectories. These findings provide important insights into identifying students at risk for poor academic performance and strategies for monitoring them to provide adequate and timely support."

In this study, we determined the effect of systemic blockade of ACVR2B ligands on cardiac function in experimental MI, and defined its efficacy to revert muscle wasting in ischemic heart failure (HF). Mice were treated with soluble ACVR2B decoy receptor (ACVR2B-Fc) to study its effect on post-MI cardiac remodeling and on later HF. Cardiac function was determined with echocardiography, and myocardium analyzed with histological and biochemical methods for hypertrophy and fibrosis. Pharmacological blockade of ACVR2B ligands did not rescue the heart from ischemic injury or alleviate post-MI remodeling and ischemic HF. Collectively, ACVR2B-Fc did not affect cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, angiogenesis, nor factors associated with cardiac regeneration except modification of certain genes involved in metabolism or cell growth/survival. ACVR2B-Fc, however, was able to reduce skeletal muscle wasting in chronic ischemic HF, accompanied by reduced LC3II as a marker of autophagy and increased mTOR signaling and Cited4 expression as markers of physiological hypertrophy in quadriceps muscle. Our results ascertain pharmacological blockade of ACVR2B ligands as a possible therapy for skeletal muscle wasting in ischemic HF.

Recently, a cofilin mutant (R21Q) was described that enables real-time tracking of cofilin–actin rod formation and dissipation in cell culture models when expressed as a fusion with the fluorescent protein mCherry (13Mi J. Shaw A.E. Pak C.W. Walsh K.P. Minamide L.S. Bernstein B.W. Kuhn T.B. Bamburg J.R. A genetically encoded reporter for real-time imaging of cofilin-actin rods in living neurons.PLoS One. 2013; 8 (24391794): e8360910.1371/journal.pone.0083609Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Unlike overexpressed WT cofilin, the R21Q mutant resists incorporation into cofilin–actin rods in the absence of oxidative and energetic stress; however, it readily incorporates into cofilin–actin bundles under sources of oxidative and energetic stress (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid, Aβ, ATP depletion). In light of the R21Q study, we asked whether a cofilin mutant with substantially reduced affinity for F-actin could be the basis for an optogenetic switch that enables the bundling of cofilin and actin in response to both light and cellular stress stimuli. The requirement for such a switch would be that it resists background incorporation into cofilin–actin bundles under both normal and cellular stress conditions, yet readily forms cofilin–actin bundles when exposed to a combination of cellular stress and light. However, in contrast to native cofilin–actin bundle formation, reversal of the light-induced cofilin–actin bundles could be accomplished without removal of the source of cellular stress. With the advantage of rapid and reversible light-mediated induction, the resulting switch would allow for tracking the formation and movement of cofilin–actin bundles in living cells, including neurons. Prior studies demonstrated that point mutants of cofilin-1 (e.g. S3E, S3A/S120A) exhibit diminished actin-binding capabilities, both when expressed as stand-alone cofilins and when incorporated into protein fusions (cofilin–cryptochrome 2–mCherry) (6Hughes R.M. Lawrence D.S. Optogenetic engineering: Light-directed cell motility.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2014; 53 (25156888): 10904-1090710.1002/anie.201404198Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We investigated whether the same cofilin-containing protein fusions exhibited a similar response to energetic stress in the presence of an ATP-depletion medium, as has been previously reported for both endogenous and overexpressed cofilins (2Minamide L.S.

Following literature procedures, cofilin (WT, S3E, S3A, S3A/S120A)-Cry2PHR-mCh protein fusions expressed in HeLa cells were incubated with either PBS or ATP depletion media for 1 h, followed by fixation and imaging. As a result of the applied cellular stress, cofilins with full actin-binding capability (WT and S3A) were readily incorporated into clusters, whereas cofilins with impaired actin-binding ability (S3A/S120A and S3E) failed to incorporate into clusters (Fig. 1A and B). Via immunostaining with an actin antibody, we demonstrated that the observed cofilin clusters were co-localized with endogenous β-actin (Fig. 1B). Further exploration of the ATP-depletion buffer revealed that using the full complement of mitochondrial inhibition (10 mm NaN3/6 mm 2-Deoxy-d-Glucose) resulted in abundant cofilin–actin clusters distributed throughout the cell body, whereas treatment with glycolytic inhibition only (0 mm NaN3/6 mm 2-DG) resulted in the accumulation of cofilin–actin bundles around the cell periphery (Fig. 2 and Figs. S1–S3). We attribute this effect to naturally occurring ROS production, which is higher at the highly dynamic cell edges (15Cameron J.M. Gabrielsen M. Chim Y.H. Munro J. McGhee E.J. Sumpton D.

Experiments were also conducted to establish the minimum time and concentrations necessary for induction of cofilin–actin clustering, demonstrating that 15 min in full ATP-depletion medium was sufficient for inducing robust cofilin–actin bundling (Fig. S1–S3).Figure 2Response to variation in stress-inducing buffers in HeLa cells expressing Cof.

To test this, both N- and C-terminal cofilin-Cry2 fusion proteins and a β-actin–CIB-GFP protein fusion were co-expressed in HeLa cells. Cells were incubated in the presence of ATP-depletion medium for 15 min prior to imaging on a widefield fluorescent microscope. Of the various combinations of cofilin-Cry2 and actin-CIB, the N-terminal Cof/S3A/S120A and the C-terminal Cof/S3E exhibited robust light- and stress-dependent cofilin–actin fusion protein clustering that was reversible in the absence of blue light (Table 1). As the response of the Cry2-mCh-CofS3E fusion was somewhat more robust (Fig. 3 and Movie S1), this construct was carried forward in conjunction with the β-actin–CIB-GFP construct for the remaining studies.Table 1Screening of optogenetic constructs in presence of light + ATP depletion: Survey of light-stimulated cofilin–actin cluster formationProtein pairDMEM/10% FBSATP-depletion mediaN-terminal cofilinsCof-WT-Cry2/ β-actin -CibNo clusters++++; ICof-S3A/S120A-Cry2/ β-actin -CibNo clusters+++; RCof-S3E-Cry2/ β-actin -CibNo clusters++; RCof-S3A/S120A-Cry2/Cib-ONLYNo clusters—C-terminal cofilinsCry2-Cof-WT/ β-actin -CibNo clusters++++; ICry2-Cof-S3A/S120A/β-actin-CibNo clusters+++; ICry2-Cof-S3E/β-actin-CibNo clusters++++; RNo cofilin controlsCry2-mCh/β-actin -CibNo clusters+; RCry2-mCh/Cib-ONLYNo clusters— Open table in a new tab As the interaction of the WT cofilin construct with endogenous actin varied in response to changing cellular stress levels, the same treatments were applied to the optogenetic cofilin–actin bundling proteins (Fig. 4 and Movies S2–S5). In response to a full complement of azide, but no glycolysis inhibitor (10 mm azide/0 mm 2-DG), light-activated cofilin–actin bundles were formed throughout cell bodies but were shorter lived than those formed in the presence of 10 mm azide/6 mm 2-DG. In response to full inhibition of glycolysis, but no azide (0 mm azide/6 mm 2-DG), light-activated cofilin–actin bundles formed chiefly around the cell periphery but were also shorter lived than those under full ATP depletion conditions. We note that this is an analogous response to that observed with incorporation of WT cofilin into endogenous actin bundles (Fig. 2). Finally, although control cells (in the absence of ATP depletion) form sparse light + stress–induced clusters (Fig. 4B), weak light-activated localization between cytosolic Cry2-mCh-CofS3E and β-actin–CIB-GFP can still be observed in a subset of transfected cells (14.5% (10.7); n = 5 replicates (Fig. 5 and Movie S5).Figure 5Stress-independent co-localization of Cry2-mCh-Cof.S3E and β-actin–CIB-GFP at the cell periphery.

One of the primary driving forces of native cofilin–actin bundling is the switch from primarily ATP-actin to ADP-actin that occurs as a result of mitochondrial inhibition-induced depletion of ATP. Thus, we investigated whether alteration of the ATP-binding site of actin via site-directed mutagenesis might alter its ability to bind cofilin in the absence of ATP depletion by mimicking actin in its ADP-bound state. Inspection of a crystal structure of actin with a nonhydrolysable ATP mimic (PDB ID 1NWK (16Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Crystal structure of monomeric actin in the ATP state. Structural basis of nucleotide-dependent actin dynamics.J. Biol.

We proposed that removal of the Ser-14–phosphate hydrogen bond–forming ability might create an actin mutant with the properties of an ADP-actin, whereas increasing the steric bulk of the Val-159 residue might have a similar effect by occluding the binding site for the tertiary phosphate of ATP. In addition to the proposed actin mutants, we also considered whether further mutagenesis of cofilin could impact the function of the light-activated switch. Cofilin has four cysteine residues, two of which have previously been demonstrated to be critical for cofilin–actin rod stability via the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds (Cys-39 and Cys-147; Fig. 6C) (14Bernstein B.W.

Simultaneous mutation of cofilin cysteines 39 and 147 to alanine has been shown to interfere with efficient incorporation into cofilin–actin rods (14Bernstein B.W. Shaw A.E. Minamide L.S. Pak C.W. Bamburg J.R. Incorporation of cofilin into rods depends on disulfide intermolecular bonds: Implications for actin regulation and neurodegenerative disease.J.

We hypothesized that if cofilin–actin bundling with CofActor was similar to native cofilin–actin rod formation, then mutagenesis of cofilin Cys-39 and Cys-147 in CofActor should also interfere with switch function in the presence of cellular stress. Single and double mutant actins and cofilins were generated and tested for their ability to participate in light- and stress-activated clustering when co-transfected with the corresponding Cry2-mCh-CofS3E or β-actin–CIB-GFP (Table 2). In the case of the V159I single mutant (β-actinV159I–CIB-GFP), light + cellular stress were both required for cofilin–actin cluster formation. However, the S14V mutant (β-actinS14V–CIB-GFP) gave a robust, reversible light-activated clustering response in the absence of ATP-depletion media (Fig. 7 and Movie S6). Notably, the S14V mutant formed rodlike bundles with dimensions similar to those observed with native cofilin–actin rods (avg. 2 rods per cell (± 1); length of 7.42 μm (± 0.68)). These structures are present prior to light-activated recruitment of Cry2, indicating that they are formed independently of optogenetic cofilin. Optogenetic cofilin undergoes light-activated recruitment to these rodlike structures in addition to forming cofilin–actin clusters analogous to those observed in the presence of nonmutant actin (Fig. 7A–F). Double mutants (S14V/V159L and S14V/V159I) exhibited a stress-independent response analogous to that of the S14V mutant, forming numerous light-independent rodlike structures present in cells (Fig. 7D). Interestingly, while the V159I single mutant (β-actinV159I–CIB-GFP) did not efficiently form stress-independent clusters as observed with the S14V mutant, it did exhibit enhanced nuclear localization and formed numerous nuclear-localized light-activated cofilin–actin clusters in the presence of cellular stress (Fig. 8 and Movie S7), indicating that the presence of a hydrophobic side chain at the 159 position may enhance nuclear import of the actin construct. In the case of the cofilin mutants (Fig. 9A–G), light- and stress-activation of cofilin–actin bundles were not significantly reduced in the C39A and C147A single mutants, but were highly diminished in the C39A/C147A double mutant, consistent with a previous report (14Bernstein B.W.

Conversely, light + stress activation of bundle formation was eliminated in the C39D and C39D/C147D mutants, but not in the C147D mutant (Fig. 9G).Table 2Summary of blue-light activation responses of actin and cofilin mutants under normal and energetic stress conditionsPBSATP depletedActin mutantsV159I—++++S14V+++++++V159L/ S14V++++++++V159I/ S14V++++++++Cofilin mutantsS3E/C39A—+++S3E/C147A—+++S3E/C39A/C147A—+S3E/C39D——S3E/C147D—+++S3E/C39D/C147D—— Open table in a new tab Figure 8Light-inducible nuclear cofilin–actin cluster formation.

Prior to light stimulation, dissociated neuron cultures transfected with the CofActor system exhibited 8.14 (± 2.49) actin rods and 2.14 (± 0.55) cofilin rods in soma and 54.86 (± 16.17) actin rods and 25.14 (± 4.69) cofilin rods in neuronal processes (Fig. 10A–C). Upon stimulation with light in ATP-depletion medium, the number of rods significantly increased in both subcellular compartments (Fig. 10B). In the soma, the number of actin rods increased by 267% (21.71 ± 5.32; p = 0.018), whereas the number of cofilin rods increased by 327% (7 ± 2.02; p = 0.032). In neuronal processes, the number of actin rods increased by 168% (92.43 ± 15.7; p = 0.004), whereas the number of cofilin rods increased by 223% (56.14 ± 12.73; p = 0.039). Taken together, the data presented here show that the CofActor optogenetic sensor reports on conditions required for the formation of native actin–cofilin rods in cells exposed to ATP-depletion conditions and therefore is a promising tool to study the cellular mechanisms that lead to abnormal cytoskeletal reorganization and are associated with pathological conditions, including neurodegeneration and excitotoxicity. Finally, we investigated whether CofActor would respond to alternate sources of cellular stress (ROS-generating H2O2), and whether that response could be inhibited with a recently reported inhibitor of cofilin–actin rod formation in neurons (20Tam S.-W.

Understanding the mechanisms for the motility of TNBC might provide novel targetable vulnerabilities of the tumors. Herein, we find that Rhophilin-associated tail protein 1 (ROPN1) is selectively overexpressed in human TNBC cell lines and tissues. Overexpression of ROPN1 promotes, while silencing of ROPN1 inhibits the robust migration, invasion, and in vivo metastasis of TNBC cells. Moreover, we find that ROPN1 activates RhoA signaling via rhophilin-1 (RHPN1), leading to enhanced actin stress fibers formation in TNBC cells. RhoA signaling is demonstrated to be essential for ROPN1-mediated migration and metastasis of TNBC cells. Finally, we find that high levels of ROPN1 are significantly associated distant metastasis and predicted poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. These findings reveal a novel mechanism for the high motility and metastasis of TNBC cells, suggesting that ROPN1 might be a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target."

Surprisingly little is known about the association of personality traits with smoking and alcohol consumption in the specific subpopulation of pregnant women. This study analyzed data from a geographically diverse sample of 603 pregnant women, aged 18 years and older, who provided information regarding their smoking and drinking habits before and during pregnancy. We compared women who consumed alcohol or smoked cigarettes before pregnancy with women who quit or continued smoking or drinking during pregnancy. Associations between personality and maladaptive behaviors prior to and during pregnancy were modeled using logistic regression. The study revealed that women who scored high on openness to experience were significantly more likely to continue alcohol consumption during pregnancy (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.01, 1.14, p = .02). This association was maintained after adjusting for potential confounds. This study demonstrated a significant relationship between personality traits and women's likelihood of continued alcohol consumption prior to and during pregnancy. Understanding personality-based determinants of health-detrimental behavior is important in order to design interventions that aim at decreasing rates of maladaptive health behaviors among pregnant women."

Although numerous studies on the impact and outbreak of Rift Valley fever exist, relatively little is known about the role of environmental factors, especially soil, on the aestivation of the virus. This study thus selected 22 sites for study in central South Africa, known to be the recurrent epicenter of widespread Rift Valley fever outbreaks in Southern Africa. Soils were described, sampled and analyzed in detail at each site. Of all the soil variables analyzed for, only eight (cation exchange capacity, exchangeable Ca2+, exchangeable K+, exchangeable Mg2+, soluble Ca2+, medium sand, As, and Br) were statistically identified to be potential indicators of sites with reported Rift Valley fever mortalities, as reported for the 2009–2010 Rift Valley fever outbreak. Four soil characteristics (exchangeable K+, exchangeable Mg2+, medium sand, and Br) were subsequently included in a discriminant function that could potentially be used to predict sites that had reported Rift Valley fever-associated mortalities in livestock. This study therefore constitutes an initial attempt to predict sites prone to Rift Valley fever livestock mortality from soil properties and thus serves as a basis for broader research on the interaction between soil, mosquitoes and Rift Valley fever virus. Future research should include other environmental components such as vegetation, climate, and water properties as well as correlating soil properties with floodwater Aedes spp. abundance and Rift Valley fever virus prevalence."

https://openalex.org/W3024907723,"Mammary gland cancer is the most common cancer occurring in women globally. Incidences of this cancer in Japan are on the increase. Annually, more than 70,000 new cases are recorded in Japan and about 1.7 million in the world. Many cases are still difficult to cure completely, and animal models are required for the characterization of the biology, therapeutic strategy, and preventive measures for spontaneous mammary tumor. The mouse model used currently has some limitations owing to structural differences between mouse and human mammary glands. Tupaia belangeri (tree shrew), which belongs to the Tupaiidae family, shows relatively high genetic homology and structural similarity to human mammary glands. Here, we characterized the spontaneous mammary tumors in 61 female tree shrews of different ages. The incidence rate was 24.6% (15/61), and the rate of simultaneous or metachronous multiplex tumors was 60% (9/15). From the incidence pattern, some cases seemed to be of familial mammary gland tumor, as the offspring of female tree shrews No. 3 and 9 and male tree shrew No. 11 showed a high incidence rate, of 73.3% (11/15). Average incidence age for tumor development was 2 years and 3 months, and the earliest was 10 months. Histochemical analysis indicated that spontaneous mammary gland tumors in the tree shrew show the features of intraductal papillary adenomas (22 cases), except 2 tubulopapillary carcinoma cases (No. 75 and 131). All the cases were positive for the progesterone receptor, whereas 91.3% were positive for the estrogen receptor, and 4.3% were HER-2 positive. We have also confirmed the expression of nectin-4 in some mammary tumor cells. Additionally, we subjected tree shrews to cytodiagnosis or X-ray CT. Thus, the findings of this study highlight the potential of the tree shrew as a valuable new animal model for mammary gland tumor study."
