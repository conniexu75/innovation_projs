Fluctuation-driven transport is one mechanism by which chemical energy can directly drive the motion of particles and macromolecules and may find application in a wide variety of fields, including particle separation and the design of molecular motors and pumps."
https://openalex.org/W1992388470,"A new class of protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors was identified that is based on an oxindole core (indolinones). Two compounds from this class inhibited the kinase activity of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and showed differential specificity toward other receptor tyrosine kinases. Crystal structures of the tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR1 in complex with the two compounds were determined. The oxindole occupies the site in which the adenine of adenosine triphosphate binds, whereas the moieties that extend from the oxindole contact residues in the hinge region between the two kinase lobes. The more specific inhibitor of FGFR1 induces a conformational change in the nucleotide-binding loop. This structural information will facilitate the design of new inhibitors for use in the treatment of cancer and other diseases in which cell signaling by tyrosine kinases plays a crucial role in disease pathogenesis."

However, the GTP-bound active form of Rho failed to exert Ca2+-sensitizing effects in extensively Triton X-100-permeabilized smooth muscle preparations, due to the loss of the important diffusible cofactor (Gong, M. C., Iizuka, K., Nixon, G., Browne, J. P., Hall, A., Eccleston, J. F., Sugai, M., Kobayashi, S., Somlyo, A. V., and Somlyo, A. P. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 1340–1345). Here we demonstrate the contractile effects of Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), recently identified as a putative target of Rho, on the Triton X-100-permeabilized smooth muscle of rabbit portal vein. Introduction of the constitutively active form of Rho-kinase into the cytosol of Triton X-100-permeabilized smooth muscle provoked a contraction and a proportional increase in levels of monophosphorylation of myosin light chain in both the presence and the absence of cytosolic Ca2+. These effects of constitutively active Rho-kinase were wortmannin (a potent myosin light chain kinase inhibitor)-insensitive. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the amount of native Rho-kinase was markedly lower in Triton X-100-permeabilized tissue than in intact tissue. Our results demonstrate that Rho-kinase directly modulates smooth muscle contraction through myosin light chain phosphorylation, independently of the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase pathway."

This was shown by in situ hybridization and computerized quantitative analysis of serial tonsil biopsies from previously untreated adults. The frequency of productive mononuclear cells (MNCs) initially diminished with a half-life of about 1 day. Surprisingly, the amount of HIV-1 RNA in virus trapped on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) decreased almost as quickly. After 24 weeks, MNCs with very few copies of HIV-1 RNA per cell were still detectable, as was proviral DNA; however, the amount of FDC-associated virus decreased by ≥3.4 log units. Thus, 6 months of potent therapy controlled active replication and cleared &gt;99.9 percent of virus from the secondary lymphoid tissue reservoir."
https://openalex.org/W2091113012,Large dynamic nuclear polarization signal enhancements (up to a factor of 100) were obtained in the solid-state magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of arginine and the protein T4 lysozyme in frozen glycerol-water solutions with the use of dynamic nuclear polarization. Polarization was transferred from the unpaired electrons of nitroxide free radicals to nuclear spins through microwave irradiation near the electron paramagnetic resonance frequency. This approach may be a generally applicable signal enhancement scheme for the high-resolution solid-state NMR spectroscopy of biomolecules.
https://openalex.org/W1483786641,"The firing rate responses of neurons in the primary visual cortex grow with stimulus contrast, the variation in the luminance of an image relative to the mean luminance. These responses, however, are reduced after a cell is exposed for prolonged periods to high-contrast visual stimuli. This phenomenon, known as contrast adaptation, occurs in the cortex and is not present at earlier stages of visual processing. To investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying cortical adaptation, intracellular recordings were performed in the visual cortex of cats, and the effects of prolonged visual stimulation were studied. Surprisingly, contrast adaptation barely affected the stimulus-driven modulations in the membrane potential of cortical cells. Moreover, it did not produce sizable changes in membrane resistance. The major effect of adaptation, evident both in the presence and in the absence of a visual stimulus, was a tonic hyperpolarization. Adaptation affects a class of synaptic inputs, most likely excitatory in nature, that exert a tonic influence on cortical cells."
https://openalex.org/W2053718673,"Timely deactivation of kinase cascades is crucial to the normal control of cell signaling and is partly accomplished by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The catalytic (α) subunit of the serine-threonine kinase casein kinase 2 (CK2) bound to PP2A in vitro and in mitogen-starved cells; binding required the integrity of a sequence motif common to CK2α and SV40 small t antigen. Overexpression of CK2α resulted in deactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and suppression of cell growth. Moreover, CK2α inhibited the transforming activity of oncogenic Ras, but not that of constitutively activated MEK. Thus, CK2α may regulate the deactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2085635715,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are important mediators of the cellular stress response. Here, we investigated the relationship between activation of the MAP kinase p38 and transcription factor NF-κB. Different forms of cellular stress were found to preferentially trigger either p38 or NF-κB. Arsenite or osmotic stress potently activated p38 but were ineffective in inducing NF-κB activation. Tumor necrosis factor-α and hydrogen peroxide, in contrast, led to NF-κB activation but only modestly stimulated p38. The activation of NF-κB was strongly abolished by antioxidants, while the activity of p38 and transcription factor AP-1 were increased. Inhibition of small GTPases including Rac and Cdc42 prevented p38 and AP-1 activation without interfering with NF-κB. In addition, inhibition of p38 by a pharmacological inhibitor or a dominant-negative mutant of MAP kinase kinase-6, an activator of the p38 pathway, interfered with NF-κB-dependent gene expression but not its DNA binding activity. Our results indicate that activation of p38 and NF-κB are mediated by separate pathways, which may converge further downstream in the cell nucleus. Different forms of cellular stress, however, initially trigger distinct signaling cascades involving either oxidative stress or GTPase-coupled pathways.

Gene induction by cellular stresses is mediated through biochemical processes that mostly involve the interplay of multiple signaling pathways. Depending on the nature of the stimulus, intricate protein kinases are activated that ultimately phosphorylate transcription factors and result in gene expression. Central mediators that propagate signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus are protein kinases related to the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; ATF, activating transcription factor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ROI, reactive oxygen intermediate; MKK, MAP kinase kinase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; AP-1, activator protein-1; PMA, phorbolmyristyl acetate; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB. 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; ATF, activating transcription factor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ROI, reactive oxygen intermediate; MKK, MAP kinase kinase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; AP-1, activator protein-1; PMA, phorbolmyristyl acetate; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB. kinase superfamily. To date, at least three different subtypes of MAP kinases are known (reviewed in Refs. 1Cahill M.A. Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Curr.

Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). These are in turn activated by distinct upstream dual specificity kinases thus revealing the existence of protein kinase modules that can be independently and simultaneously activated. Whereas mitogens and growth factors lead to activation of protein kinase cascades resulting in activation of ERK family MAP kinases, many forms of cellular stress preferentially trigger two related signaling pathways (4Minden A.

These center on two MAP kinase homologues called stress-activated protein kinases or Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38, also termed reactivating kinase. Targets of stress-activated protein kinase and JNK include several transcription factors such as c-Jun, JunD, ATF-2, and Elk-1, which become activated after exposure to cellular stresses (9Livingstone C.

Mammalian p38 was originally identified in murine pre-B cells transfected with the lipopolysaccharide complex receptor CD14 and in macrophages where it is activated in response to lipopolysaccharide (13Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of p38 is most similar to HOG-1, a MAP kinase homologue that lies in a signaling pathway that restores the osmotic gradient across the plasma membrane of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in response to increased external osmolarity (14Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Like ERKs and JNKs, p38 requires phosphorylation of a closely spaced tyrosine and threonine for activation. However, the enzyme is distinguished by the sequence TGY in the activation domain, which differs from the TEY sequence found in ERKs, and the TPY sequence in the JNK and MAP kinase homologues. In addition to hyperosmotic shock, p38 is activated by a wide spectrum of stimuli such as physicochemical stresses, lipopolysaccharide, and cytokines (13Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar, 15Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnel P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W.

Despite rapid progress in the elucidation of structural elements of the p38 pathway, the physiological consequences of its stimulation by stress agents largely remain to be defined. One of the downstream targets of p38 is the MAPKAP kinase-2, which can activate the transcription factors CREB and ATF-1 (18Tan Y. Rose J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) and phosphorylate heat-shock protein hsp27 (19Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamarazes A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). It is assumed that hsp27 phosphorylation promotes the polymerization of actin and so counteracts the disruptive effects of stress on actin microfilaments (21Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24210-24214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of evidences further suggest that p38 plays a key role in regulating apoptotic and inflammatory responses. Highly specific inhibitors of p38 such as pyridinyl imidazoles potently block the synthesis of TNF and interleukin-1 (22Young P. McDonell P. Dunnington D. Hand A. Laydon J. Lee J. Agents Actions. 1993; 39: C67-C69Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Prevention of interleukin-1 and TNF synthesis was shown to be due to inhibition of translation initiation, which is regulated through the AUUUA motif in the 3′-untranslated regions of their transcripts (23Prichett W. Hand A. Sheilds J. Dunnington D. J. Inflamm. 1995; 45: 97-105PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, inhibition of p38 has been found to prevent interleukin-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA synthesis indicating that p38 may regulate transcriptional events (24Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In this respect, p38 has been implicated in the activation of multiple transcription factors, such as ATF-2 (17Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 10531-10534Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and NF-κB (24Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activator NF-κB is a key component controlling the synthesis of cytokines and many other immunoregulatory gene products (reviewed in Refs. 29Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar and 30Schulze-Osthoff K. Los M. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The factor is triggered by a great variety of proinflammatory or pathogenic stimuli including inflammatory cytokines, phorbol ester, T cell mitogens, and lipopolysaccharide, as well as ionizing and UV irradiation. In unstimulated cells, NF-κB resides in the cytoplasm as an inactive heterodimeric complex bound to a third inhibitory subunit called IκB. Upon stimulation of cells, NF-κB is rapidly activated by the dissociation of IκB. This exposes nuclear localization sequences in the remaining NF-κB heterodimer, leading to nuclear translocation and subsequent binding of NF-κB to DNA-regulatory elements within target genes. It has been found that the dissociation of IκB is preceded by its phosphorylation, an event which subsequently leads to the proteolytic degradation of IκB (31Traenckner E.B.-M. Pahl H.L. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). A number of evidences further suggest that reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) are the essential second messengers involved in the course of NF-κB activation (30Schulze-Osthoff K. Los M. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This is supported by the findings that (i) NF-κB is readily activated in many cell types exposed to hydrogen peroxide (32Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3387) Google Scholar, 33Los M. Dröge W. Stricker K. Baeuerle P.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and (ii) activation in response to all stimuli tested so far is blocked by a variety of antioxidants (32Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3387) Google Scholar, 34Schulze-Osthoff K. Beyaert R. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is currently assumed that the intracellular production of ROIs, which is stimulated by stress inducers, activates a redox-sensitive kinase that in turn phosphorylates IκB. As many of the stimuli leading to NF-κB and p38 activation are similar, we wished to establish the relationship between p38 and NF-κB-mediated transcription. A potential role of p38 in NF-κB activation has recently been implicated by the finding that p38-specific inhibitors potently attenuate NF-κB activity (24Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). We report here that although some stress inducers such as TNF activate both p38 and NF-κB, other stimuli including sodium arsenite and hyperosmotic shock selectively trigger p38. In addition, the antioxidants that prevented NF-κB activation did not inhibit but even increased p38 activity. However, blockade of p38 activation by a specific p38 inhibitor or a dominant-negative MAP kinase kinase-6 (MKK6) mutant inhibited NF-κB-dependent gene expression without interfering with NF-κB DNA binding activity. These data indicate that activation of NF-κB and p38 lie on primarily separate stress-responsive pathways but may converge downstream at the level of NF-κB-mediated transactivation. The human embryonic kidney cell line 293 and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 0.1 mg of streptomycin/ml. All reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Recombinant human TNF-α was a gift (Knoll AG, Ludwigshafen, Federal Republic of Germany). Toxin A from Clostridium difficile was kindly provided by Drs. F. Hofmann and K. Aktories (Freiburg, FRG) and the p38 specific inhibitor SB203580 by Dr. J. Lee (King of Prussia, PA). p38 kinase activity was measured following expression of a glutathione S-transferase (GST) p38 fusion plasmid that was driven by the human EF-1α promoter and kindly provided by Dr. L. E. Zon. GST-ATF-2 (amino acids 1–109), which served as a p38 substrate, was expressed in Escherichia coliand purified by glutathione affinity chromatography (10Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). To analyze the substrate specificity of p38 the following recombinant fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified by standard techniques: GST-IκB-α (35McElhinny J.A. Trushin S.A. Bren G.A. Chester N. Paya C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 899-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), His-p50, 2K. von Schack, unpublished data. and His-Gal4-p65 (36Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 714-718PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the transactivating activity of NF-κB, cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter gene construct controlled by six κB-binding sites (37Grimm S. Bauer M.K.A. Baeuerle P.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The plasmid pCMV-p65 (38Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) served as a positive control. A CMV-driven eukaryotic ATF-2 expression plasmid has been described (9Livingstone C. Patel G. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1785-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). A dominant-negative expression plasmid of MKK6 (K82A) (25Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar) was originally obtained from Dr. R. J. Davis. Transfections of cells were performed by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (37Grimm S. Bauer M.K.A. Baeuerle P.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5 × 106 cells for kinase assays and 2 × 105cells for luciferase assays were seeded on 10-cm and 6-cm plates, respectively, and transfected after overnight incubation. Eighteen h later, cells were either left untreated or stimulated with the indicated reagents. After 1 or 6 h cells were harvested and assayed for p38 kinase or luciferase activity, respectively. Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection, lysed in 25 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 1% Triton X-100, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mmEGTA, 1 mm DTT, and centrifuged at 13,000 ×g at 4 °C for 5 min. Fifty microliters of the supernatant were assayed in 100 μl of assay buffer (25 mmglycylglycine, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mmEGTA, 15 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.8, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP) using a LB 96 P luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbach, FRG). Following injection of 100 μl of luciferin (0.3 mg/ml) light emission was measured in 30-s intervals. Results are given in relative light units. p38 activity was determined by a solid-phase kinase assay using GST-ATF-2 as substrate. Following transfection with the GST-p38 construct, 293 cells (1.5 × 106) were extracted in 100 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100. After centrifugation to remove cellular debris, 300 μl of equilibration buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Triton X-100) were added. p38 was adsorbed by the addition of 30 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-coupled Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, the beads were washed twice with washing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.05% Triton X-100), twice in LiCl buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 500 mm LiCl, 0.1 mmNa3VO4), and twice in washing buffer. The beads were then equilibrated by two washing steps in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 40 μm ATP, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mmNa3VO4). The kinase reaction was performed by adding 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 5 μg of GST-ATF-2 as substrate. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 4 × Laemmli sample buffer. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel, visualized by autoradiography, and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. For detection of NF-κB and AP-1 DNA binding activities, cells were essentially processed as described (39Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed in a 20-μl volume containing 3–4 μg of extract, 4 μl of 5 × binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 20% Ficoll), 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor DNA, 2 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 10,000–15,000 cpm Cerenkov radiation of the labeled oligonucleotide. After a 30-min binding reaction at room temperature, samples were loaded on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and run in 0.5 × TBE buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA), pH 8.3. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used to detect the DNA binding activity of NF-κB and AP-1 were as follows (binding sites are underlined): NF-κB, 5′-AGCTTCAGAGGGGATTTCCGAGAGG-3′; AP-1, 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′. The oligonucleotides were annealed with their complementary strands and labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) and [γ-32P]ATP. The labeled probes were purified from free nucleotides on push columns (Stratagene, Heidelberg, FRG). p38 MAP kinase is known to be activated by a variety of cellular stresses. To measure kinase activity we expressed GST-tagged p38 in 293 cells and determined p38 activity in a solid-phase assay with ATF-2 as substrate. The classical stress inducers such as the sulfhydryl agent sodium arsenite and hyperosmotic concentrations of sorbitol stimulated p38 activity to as much as 11- and more than 20-fold of the control, respectively (Fig.1, A and C). p38 activity was also strongly induced by the phorbol ester PMA and to a lesser extent by TNF. The combined incubation with both TNF and PMA resulted in additive stimulatory effects. Treatment of cells with hydrogen peroxide caused only a moderate increase in p38 activity, and in some experiments stimulation by hydrogen peroxide was only slightly above basal activity. In parallel experiments we measured the activation of transcription factor NF-κB, which is activated by various stimuli many of those resembling p38 activators. In contrast to p38, NF-κB was virtually not activated by sorbitol and sodium arsenite (Fig. 1, B andC). Maximum activation of NF-κB was observed after treatment with TNF. Phorbol ester did not activate NF-κB in 293 cells, although in other cell types activation by PMA was obtained. As reported earlier (32Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3387) Google Scholar, 33Los M. Dröge W. Stricker K. Baeuerle P.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), NF-κB was also activated in response to hydrogen peroxide. We further analyzed the effects of okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor, and thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endoplasmic Ca2+ ATPase, which have been shown to activate NF-κB (40Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2580-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid strongly induced p38 and NF-κB activation (Fig. 1 D). Thapsigargin, although weaker, activated NF-κB but had virtually no effects on p38 activity. Collectively, these data demonstrate that activation of p38 and NF-κB are only partially overlapping. Several stress inducers activate selectively either p38 MAP kinase or NF-κB, thus indicating the existence of alternate stress-inducing pathways. Blockade of p38 activation has previously been shown to inhibit NF-κB-transactivating activity (24Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the ability of p38 MAP kinase to phosphorylate NF-κB subunit proteins in vitro. In the experiments, the potential substrates were expressed in E. coli as GST or Gal4 fusion proteins and incubated with purified p38 expressed in 293 cells. Fig. 2 shows that none of the NF-κB proteins including p50, the transactivating C terminus of p65, and IκB-α were phosphorylated by p38. In contrast, ATF-2 was strongly phosphorylated by p38 MAP kinase. The results indicate that NF-κB is unlikely to serve as a direct target of p38. Besides NF-κB another important stress-responsive transcription factor is AP-1. The factor comprises a homo- or heterodimeric complex composed of proteins of the Fos, Jun, and ATF families. ERKs, JNKs, and presumably p38 are involved in activation of c-Jun and ATF-2 (9Livingstone C. Patel G. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1785-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 41van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). We analyzed activation of AP-1 DNA binding using an oligonucleotide with the classical AP-1 site from the collagenase promoter. This motif preferentially binds to Jun/Jun and Jun/Fos but not to ATF-2/Jun dimers (41van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In identical cellular extracts used for the analysis of NF-κB, it was found that AP-1 DNA binding activity was significantly increased in response to all stress stimuli (Fig. 3). PMA and TNF, either alone or in combination, potently induced AP-1 activation. A strong activation was also observed in response to treatment with sodium arsenite, sorbitol, and hydrogen peroxide. We did not investigate further the subunit composition or requirement of de novo protein synthesis in response to each individual stress stimulus. Based on previous reports it can be presumed that activation of AP-1 by PMA, TNF, and other cellular stressors involves different types of MAP kinases targeting distinct AP-1 subunits. Thus, physicochemical stresses preferentially lead to ATF-2 activation, whereas phorbol ester and TNF mainly activate c-Jun (41van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 42Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). The experiments demonstrate that, in contrast to NF-κB, a larger variety of extracellular stimuli converge at the level of AP-1. The activation of both NF-κB and AP-1 is controlled by redox-sensitive signaling pathways (30Schulze-Osthoff K. Los M. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a prooxidant-inducible factor whose activation is inhibited by a variety of antioxidants. In contrast, antioxidants have been shown to increase the activation of AP-1 by inducing c-fos and c-jun transcription (43Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar, 44Schenk H. Klein M. Erdbrügger W. Dröge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of ROIs in p38 activation we used the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an iron chelator and glutathione precursor. Fig. 4 A demonstrates that preincubation of 293 cells with PDTC considerably increased p38 kinase activity in response to all stimuli analyzed. Consistent with this and previous reports, AP-1 activation was also enhanced by PDTC. In contrast, NF-κB activation in response to TNF, when measured in identical extracts, was completely abolished (Fig. 4 A). The data demonstrate that p38 and NF-κB are oppositely regulated by redox-dependent processes. Similar to AP-1, p38 activity is enhanced by antioxidants. To investigate whether antioxidants have a direct effect on p38 kinase activity, we incubated p38 extracted from PMA-treated cells with PDTC. Virtually no change in kinase activity was observed following treatment of p38 with different concentrations of PDTC (Fig. 4 B) or glutathione (data not shown) in vitro. This shows that antioxidants could potentiate p38 activity only in intact cells. We further sought to dissect the signaling pathways by studying the involvement of GTPase proteins. The small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 have recently been identified as important intermediates to the JNK and p38 activation cascades (4Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar, 5Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). The activity of Rac and Cdc42 but not of Ras is specifically inhibited by enterotoxin toxin A from C. difficile (45Just I. Wilm M. Selzer J. Rex G. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13932-13936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of 293 cells with toxin A caused a strong inhibition of p38 activation indicating the involvement of Rac and Cdc42 in p38 kinase activation (Fig. 4 A). In line with the previous results, AP-1 activation was also inhibited by toxin A (Fig. 4 A) in response to all stimuli. Virtually no effect was observed for NF-κB suggesting that signals leading to NF-κB activation are not transduced through Rho-related GTPases. In the previous experiments it could not be excluded that additional components lying in the p38 kinase pathway cooperate with NF-κB-mediated transactivation. We therefore overexpressed p38 and ATF-2 in 293 and HeLa cells and investigated the effects on expression of a NF-κB-controlled reporter gene. Transfections with different concentrations of the p38 encoding plasmid did not markedly change NF-κB acti"

https://openalex.org/W2056961349,Hanatoxin (HaTx) binds to multiple sites on the surface of the drk1voltage-gated K+ channel and modifies channel gating. We set out to identify channel residues that contribute to form these HaTx binding sites. Chimeras constructed using the drk1and shakerK+ channels suggest that the S3–S4 linker may contain influential residues. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the region extending from the C terminal end of S3 through S4 identified a number of residues that likely contribute to form the HaTx binding sites. The pore blocker Agitoxin2 and the gating modifier HaTx can simultaneously bind to individual K+ channels. These results suggest that residues near the outer edges of S3 and S4 form the HaTx binding sites and are eccentrically located at least 15 Å from the central pore axis on the surface of voltage-gated K+ channels.

https://openalex.org/W2092843498,"The mitochondrial permeability transition pore, a cyclosporin A-sensitive channel, can be opened by the addition of protonophoric uncouplers such as carbonyl cyanide<i>p</i>-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) after energy-dependent accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We have proposed that the relevant effect of FCCP on the pore is membrane depolarization, suggesting that this channel is voltage-dependent (Bernardi, P. (1992) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 267, 8334–8339). Here, we reconsider this hypothesis in the light of recent observations suggesting that increased production of reactive oxygen species and/or direct effects of FCCP, rather than membrane depolarization, could be the actual triggers of the FCCP-dependent permeability transition. We show that although reactive oxygen species can contribute to the permeability transition, pore opening by FCCP can still be observed under strict anaerobiosis after ATP-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>accumulation and that the permeability transition can be induced by the addition of valinomycin to respiring mitochondria treated with nigericin in low potassium medium. In this system, pore opening in increasing fractions of mitochondria depends on the concentration of valinomycin, <i>i.e.</i> on the magnitude of the potassium current that determines the extent of membrane depolarization. We conclude that the permeability transition pore is directly modulated by the membrane potential in intact isolated rat liver mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1516078818,"A mechanism is proposed to explain the activity of orotidine 5′-monophosphate decarboxylase (ODCase). This enzyme is the one of the most proficient known, with a catalytic proficiency ( k cat / K m )/ k non = 10 23 M −1 . Quantum mechanical calculations predict a mechanism involving a stabilized carbene intermediate, which represents a previously unrecognized mode of enzymatic activity for ODCase. The proposed mechanism involves proton transfer from a weak acid (p K a = 7, where K a is the acid constant) concerted with decarboxylation, in a nonpolar enzyme environment. Such a mechanism makes possible different approaches to the design of ODCase inhibitors. Furthermore, the prediction that general acid catalysis may only be effective in low dielectric media is of general significance for understanding the activity of many enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2025536305,"The integrin α1β1 is a cell surface receptor for collagens and laminin. The α1 subunit contains an A-domain, and the A-domains of other integrins are known to mediate ligand binding. To determine the role of the α1 A-domain in ligand binding and the extent to which it reproduced the ligand binding activity and specificity of the parent molecule, we produced recombinant α1 A-domain and tested its ability to bind collagens and laminin. In solid phase assays, the A-domain from α1 was found to bind to collagen I, collagen IV, and laminin in a largely cation-dependent manner. The α2 A-domain, from the α2β1 integrin, also bound to these ligands, but the binding hierarchy differed from that seen for α1. This is the first demonstration of laminin binding by A-domains. Specificity of A-domain-ligand binding was further investigated using the triple-helical proteolytic fragment of collagen IV, CB3, and its subfragments, F1 and F4. α1 A-domain bound to all three fragments, while the α2 A-domain bound CB3 less well and exhibited little binding to F1 and no binding to F4. These differences mirror previous reports of distinct integrin binding sites in collagen IV and for the first time identify a limited proteolytic fragment of a ligand that contains integrin A-domain binding activity. To gain insight into the contribution that the A-domain makes to ligand binding within the whole integrin heterodimer, we measured binding constants for A-domain-collagen interactions using surface plasmon resonance biosensor technology.

Integrins are a family of αβ heterodimeric cell surface receptors, responsible for cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. The specificity and regulation of these interactions is critical to many biological processes, including embryonic cell migration, wound healing, and the immune response (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9002) Google Scholar). The integrin family contains at least 16 α subunits, seven of which contain an ∼200 amino acid inserted domain in their N-terminal region (I or A-domain) (2Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Doliana R.

This domain is homologous to the von Willebrand factor A-domain, a module also found in a number of other membrane, plasma, and matrix proteins (2Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Doliana R.

Hematol. 1993; 15: 149-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These interactions, like all integrin-ligand binding events, are cation-dependent and require Mg2+or Mn2+; Ca2+, however, does not support binding (17Luque A. Sanchez-Madrid F. Cabanas C. FEBS Letts. 1994; 346: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A similar pattern of ligand binding is found for the closely related integrin α2β1, which also interacts with collagen I, collagen IV, and laminin (16Tuckwell D.S. Humphries M.J. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1993; 15: 149-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). α1β1 and α2β1 have, however, been shown to differ in their relative affinities for ligands, with α1β1 binding collagen IV and laminin with higher affinity (18Kern A Eble J. Golbik R. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Integrins α1β1 and α2β1 also bind to a proteolytic fragment of collagen IV, CB3 (19Vandenberg P. Kern A. Ries A. Luckenbill-Edds L. Mann K. Kühn K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), but are believed to have distinct binding sites within this fragment (18Kern A Eble J. Golbik R. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the α1 A-domain in ligand binding, we have generated recombinant A-domain in a bacterial expression system and tested its binding to a range of integrin ligands. The specificity of A-domain ligand binding has also been examined by comparing recombinant α1, α2, and αM integrin A-domains. We find that integrin α1 A-domain binds to collagen I, collagen IV, and laminin in a saturable, concentration-dependent manner and that the binding can be inhibited by an anti-functional anti-α1 monoclonal antibody (mAb). 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TBS, tris-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; ABTS, 2′2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid). 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TBS, tris-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; ABTS, 2′2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid). α2 A-domain also binds these ligands, while αM A-domain does not. The αM A-domain does, however, bind to fibrinogen, while the α1 and α2 A-domains do not. This binding is largely cation-dependent, and real time binding studies using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis suggests that cation, A-domain, and ligand may form a ternary complex. By using proteolytic fragments of collagen IV, the ligand specificity of the closely related α1 and α2 A-domains has been compared. The results indicate that recombinant A-domains retain the specificity reported for intact receptors. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 391 DNA synthesizer. Antibodies were obtained from the following sources: monoclonal mouse anti-human integrin α1, 5E8D9 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., New York); monoclonal mouse anti-human integrin α2, Gi9 (The Binding Site, Birmingham, United Kingdom.) and 16B4 (previously reported as 1C11) raised as described by Mouldet al.

Rat tail tendon type I collagen, human placental type IV collagen, and human fibrinogen were obtained from Sigma, Poole, Dorset, UK. Rat laminin was obtained from Life Technologies Ltd., Paisley, UK. The collagen IV fragments CB3, F1, and F4 were produced as described previously (18Kern A Eble J. Golbik R. Kühn K. Eur. J.

Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The production of recombinant α2 A-domain has already been described (12Tuckwell D.S. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 107: 1629-1637Google Scholar). The α1 and αM A-domains were produced in a similar manner. DNA coding for the A-domains from integrins α1 and αM was produced by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Total RNA prepared from the A375 human melanoma cell line (for α1) or human buffy coat lymphocytes (for αM) was a gift of L. J. Green (University of Manchester, UK). First strand cDNA was generated using a 3′ primer spanning the predicted end of the integrin A-domains and incorporating a SalI site (α1, 5′-TTTGTCGACTCAGGCTTCCAGG GCAAATATTCTTTCTCC-3′; αM, 5′-TTTGTCGACTCAACCCTCGATCGCAAAGATCTTCTCCCG-3′). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of this cDNA was then carried out using the thermostable proof-reading DNA polymerase Pfu (Stratagene Ltd., Cambridge, UK) with the above 3′ primer and a 5′ primer designed to produce DNA coding for 17 amino acids preceding the predicted start of the integrin A-domain (21Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and including a BamHI site (α1, 5′-TTTGGATCCGTCAGCCCCACATTTCAAGTCGTGAATTCC-3′; αM, 5′-TTTGGATCCAACCTACGGCAGCAGCCCCAG-3′). 50 cycles, each consisting of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 2.5 min at 72 °C, were carried out. PCR products, of the correct Mr, were then excised from a 1% agarose gel. After digestion withBamHI and SalI, the products were ligated into pUC119 and used to transform Escherichia coli strain DH5αF′. A-domain sequences from transformants were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (52597) Google Scholar) and compared with the published sequences (α1 and αM, see Refs. 23Briesewitz R. Epstein M.R. Marcantonio E.E. J. Biol.

Gene ( Amst .). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar) (Pharmacia, Milton Keynes, UK). Transformants were screened, and protein was produced as described for α2 (12Tuckwell D.S. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 107: 1629-1637Google Scholar) except that dithiothreitol was not required for GST removal from α1 and αM A-domains. For experiments using fusion protein, a single glutathione affinity step was performed and thrombin digestion was not carried out. The recombinant A-domains produced were 214 (α1), 224 (α2), and 211 (αM) amino acids long. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of thrombin-cleaved α1 and αM A-domains confirmed the predicted starting sequence. A-domain-GST fusion proteins, collagen I, and fibrinogen were biotinylated as follows. Protein was diluted to 1 mg/ml in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5 (TBS), and dry sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimido-biotin (Pierce, Chester, UK) was added to give a ratio of 1:1 (w/w) protein:biotin. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature and then dialyzed against TBS (or 0.1 m acetic acid for collagen I) to remove unincorporated biotin. Binding of soluble ligand to immobilized A-domain was measured using assays adapted from Tuckwellet al. (12Tuckwell D.S. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J.

A-domain fusion proteins (10 μg/ml in PBS without divalent cations, PBS−) were coated to 96-well microtitre plates (Immulon 4, Dynatech, Billingshurst, UK) overnight at 4 °C. Wells were then blocked with 50 mg/ml BSA in TBS for 1 h at room temperature and, washed twice with TBS, and biotinylated ligand in TBS, 1 mg/ml BSA, plus cation, was added for 3 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed three times with TBS, 1 mm MnCl2, and ExtrAvidin peroxidase (Sigma; 10 μg/ml in TBS, 1 mmMnCl2) was added for 15 min. After washing three times with TBS, 1 mm MnCl2, bound ligand was visualized with 0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.05 mNaH2PO4, 2 mm2′2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), 0.03% H2O2. Wells were read at 405 nm on a plate reader. Assays measuring binding of soluble A-domains to immobilized ligand were carried out essentially as above, but plates were coated with ligand (usually at 30 μg/ml) instead of fusion protein and binding of biotinylated A-domain fusion protein was measured. For antibody detection of unbiotinylated A-domain fusion protein binding to ligand, the assay was performed as above up to the streptavidin step where 5 μg/ml anti-GST antibody in TBS, 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm MnCl2 was added for 1 h instead. Wells were washed three times with TBS, 1 mmMnCl2, and 1:500 peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) in TBS, 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mmMnCl2 was added for 45 min. Wells were washed three times with TBS, 1 mm MnCl2, and binding was detected with ABTS as above. The kinetic parameters (apparent association and dissociation rate constants ka andkd, respectively) and the apparent equilibrium constant (KD) for A-domain binding to collagen I and IV were measured using SPR on a BIAcoreTM (Biacore, St. Albans, UK). This biosensor device was used in accordance with the manufacturer instructions. Briefly, collagen I or IV was covalently coupled via primary amine groups to the dextran matrix of a CM5 sensor chip. A-domain solution was flowed over the chip at 5 μl/min, and binding was measured as a function of time. TBS, 1 mmMnCl2 was used as running buffer throughout, and injections of TBS, 10 mm EDTA were used to remove bound A-domain, regenerating the surface for further binding experiments. The curve fitting software, BIAevaluation, was used to fit these results to the simple first order interaction model A + B ⇔ AB. This produced values for ka and kd, allowing the apparent equilibrium constant KD to be derived fromkd/ka. To measure binding in the presence of divalent cations other than Mn2+, a 10-min injection of TBS, 10 mm EDTA was passed over the chip (to remove any residual Mn2+) immediately prior to injection of A-domain in the specified cation. The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to generate integrin α1 A-domain cDNA from A375 human melanoma cell line RNA and integrin αM A-domain cDNA from human buffy coat lymphocyte RNA. After cloning into pUC119, sequencing revealed that the αM A-domain cDNA matched the published sequence (24Corbi A.L. Kishimoto T.K. Miller L.J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12403-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequencing of α1 A-domain cDNA revealed three differences from the published sequence (23Briesewitz R. Epstein M.R. Marcantonio E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2989-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): 1) an inserted Thr at position 502; 2) a deleted Ala at position 511, which put the sequence back in frame after the earlier insertion, and 3) a Cys to Thr mutation at position 674. These differences result in two changes in the predicted amino acid sequence of the protein, a lysine to glutamate at position 170 and a threonine to isoleucine at 228, numbered from the start of the mature polypeptide. Repeating the RT-PCR using two different A375 RNA samples produced the same sequence, and RT-PCR using human smooth muscle RNA also gave the same sequence. As all PCR reactions used a proof-reading DNA polymerase and produced the same sequence from different RNA samples, we believe that it represents an accurate human α1 integrin sequence. Integrin A-domain cDNAs were cloned into the pGEX-2T3 expression vector and used to transform E. coli. After induction, transformants expressed GST-A-domain fusion proteins of ∼50 kDa as reported for the α2 A-domain (12Tuckwell D.S. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 107: 1629-1637Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-agarose columns and were either used directly or cleaved with thrombin and passed through a second glutathione-agarose column to produce purified 25 kDa A-domain. N-terminal sequencing of purified A-domains showed that cleavage had occurred at the expected site. SDS-PAGE showed the recombinant protein was at least 90% pure (data not shown). All A-domains reacted specifically with previously characterized mAbs: the α2 A-domain bound a number of anti-α2 integrin mAbs, including Gi9, an anti-functional mAb. The α1 A-domain was recognized by the anti-functional anti-α1 integrin mAb 5E8D9 in ELISA, and αM A-domain bound the anti-functional anti-αM mAb 44 (data not shown). The integrins α1β1 and α2β1 are reported to be collagen receptors, while integrin αMβ2 binds non-collagenous ligands. To investigate the role of A-domains in binding collagen, the binding of biotinylated collagen I to A-domain fusion proteins was measured. Fig. 1 shows that the A-domain fusion proteins from α1 and α2 integrins support dose-dependent, saturable binding of collagen I, while the αM A-domain exhibits very little binding. Collagen I shows a higher maximal binding to the α1 A-domain than to the α2 A-domain. The observed differences in binding were not due to different coating efficiencies of the GST-fusion proteins as the coating concentration chosen (10 μg/ml) gave very similar, almost maximal, coating of all three fusion proteins to the plate as measured by anti-GST antibody in ELISA (data not shown). The differences between α1 and α2 A-domains may instead reflect differences in the amount of correctly folded A-domain in the different samples rather than a difference in the number of binding sites per A-domain. Binding of collagen I was dependent on the conformation of the triple helix, as heat denaturation of the collagen I at 50 °C for 30 min inhibited its binding to α1 and α2 A-domains (data not shown). To confirm the specificity of the A-domains for their ligands, we investigated binding of the known αMβ2 ligand fibrinogen to all three A-domains. Biotinylated fibrinogen bound to the αM A-domain in the presence of 1 mm Mn2+ but did not bind to α1 or α2 A-domains, above the GST control (Fig. 2). Interestingly the binding to GST was higher than to BSA. Fibrinogen binding to αM A-domain was reduced to GST levels by 5 mm EDTA indicating that the binding was cation-dependent. The binding of biotinylated fibrinogen to αM A-domain was also reduced to the levels of the GST control by the anti-functional anti-αM mAb 44 (data not shown). Having shown that the αM A-domain interaction with fibrinogen required divalent cations, we investigated the effect of different divalent cations on biotinylated collagen I binding to α1 and α2 A-domains. Fig. 3 A shows that collagen binding to α1 A-domain was completely inhibited by EDTA and, therefore, requires divalent cations. However, the nature of the divalent cation had little effect as Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ all supported similar levels of binding. Of the three cations, Mn2+ supported the highest levels of binding. This cation profile does not match that reported for the whole integrin, where Mg2+ was required for ligand binding and Ca2+did not support binding (17Luque A. Sanchez-Madrid F. Cabanas C. FEBS Letts. 1994; 346: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Collagen binding to α2 A-domain was inhibited by EDTA (Fig. 3 B); however, in this case Ca2+ supported only very little binding, and Mg2+ and Mn2+ produced identical levels of collagen binding. This is in agreement with previously published data (12Tuckwell D.S. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 107: 1629-1637Google Scholar). Thus, while the A-domains from integrins α1 and α2 both bind collagen I, they differ in their cation specificities. The binding of soluble A-domain to immobilized collagen was also investigated. This was carried out using biotinylated A-domain fusion proteins or by antibody detection of the GST moiety on the A-domain fusion protein. Both methods demonstrated concentration-dependent saturable binding of α1 A-domain to collagen I; however, EDTA only partially inhibited this interaction (Fig. 4 A). Inhibition was similar in both biotinylation and antibody detection assays, with slightly more inhibition seen for the antibody detection assays (data not shown). In both assays, inhibition was maximal at lower A-domain protein concentrations. Similar results were obtained for α2 A-domain binding to collagen I (data not shown). The discrepancy between cation-dependence of collagen binding to immobilized A-domain and A-domain binding to immobilized collagen is difficult to explain. The interaction appeared to be specific as, under these conditions, binding was still dependent on the triple-helical conformation of collagen and the native A-domain structure, as heat denaturation of either component strongly inhibited binding (Fig.4 B, and data not shown). To address the apparent discrepancies in solid phase assay results, the cation dependence of the A-domain-collagen interaction was further investigated using SPR measurements on a BIAcore. Collagen I was covalently immobilized onto the sensor chip, and binding of A-domain was measured. These measurements were performed for both α1 and α2 A-domain fusion proteins at a range of concentrations (3–100 μg/ml). Fig. 5 shows a typical sensorgram of α1 A-domain binding to collagen I in the presence of 1 mmMn2+. Association and dissociation phases are marked and removal of bound A-domain with 10 mm EDTA is shown. EDTA injection removed 86 ± 2% of the bound α1 A-domain (mean ± S.E.; n = 33) and 82 ± 8% of the bound α2 A-domain (mean ± S.E.; n = 10), indicating that the presence of divalent cation is required for maintenance of the bound complex, not simply for A-domain-collagen binding. GST failed to bind collagen in these assays. Binding of fusion proteins in the presence of different cations was also investigated, and, as already seen for biotinylated collagen binding to A-domains, 1 mmMn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ all supported α1 A-domain binding while only Mn2+ and Mg2+supported α2 A-domain binding. No binding occurred without addition of divalent cations (data not shown). This supports the ligand-binding assay results that demonstrated a cation-dependent interaction. In addition to collagen I, α1β1 is also reported to bind collagen IV and laminin (16Tuckwell D.S. Humphries M.J. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1993; 15: 149-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The binding of collagen IV could not be studied using immobilized A-domains because collagen IV is a poor biotinylation substrate. 2D. A. Calderwood, unpublished observation. Antibody detection of α1 A-domain fusion protein binding to immobilized collagen I, collagen IV, and laminin showed that the α1 A-domain bound all these ligands in a concentration-dependent, saturable manner (Fig.6 A). The α1 A-domain exhibited very similar levels of binding to collagen I and collagen IV, with laminin bound to a lesser extent. In addition, CB3, an integrin-binding proteolytic fragment of collagen IV, supported a similar level of binding to intact collagen IV although binding was less at lower A-domain concentrations. To test the specificity of the A-domain binding, we investigated cation dependence and antibody inhibition at low A-domain concentrations. Fig.6 B shows that 0.2 μg/ml of biotinylated α1 A-domain bound collagen I, collagen IV, laminin, and CB3 and that binding was inhibited by EDTA and the anti-α1 integrin mAb 5E8D9. The integrin α2β1 is also a receptor for laminin and collagen IV, so we investigated the binding of α2 A-domain to these ligands and compared it with α1 A-domain. Fig. 7 shows that α2 A-domain bound to collagen IV and laminin; however, in this case, collagen I was a better ligand than collagen IV and laminin. Furthermore, CB3 supported much less binding than collagen IV, unlike the case with α1. Thus, while α1 and α2 A-domains bound the same range of ligands, comparison of Figs. 6 A and 7 indicate that the relative binding to these ligands differed between the two A-domains. GST showed only background levels of binding to laminin, collagen I, and collagen IV (data not shown). Proteolytic fragments of collagen IV were used to further investigate the differences between α1 and α2 A-domains and the integrin binding sites in collagen IV. As described above, both α1 and α2 A-domains bound to CB3, which is consistent with results obtained for whole integrins in solid phase binding assays and cell attachment assays (12Tuckwell D.S. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 107: 1629-1637Google Scholar, 18Kern A Eble J. Golbik R. Kühn K. Eur. J.

Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Further proteolysis of this fragment produces four smaller fragments, F1–F4, and investigation of integrin binding sites in these fragments demonstrated that both α1β1 and α2β1 were able to bind to F1 but only α1β1 bound to F4 (18Kern A Eble J. Golbik R. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). F4 lacks the N- and C-terminal regions present in CB3 and F1, which are thought to contain the α2β1 recognition site. Antibody detection of fusion protein binding demonstrated that α1 A-domain bound both F1 and F4 in a concentration-dependent saturable manner, while α2 A-domain bound only poorly, if at all, to F1 and not at all to F4. This binding was inhibited by 5 mm EDTA (data not shown). Binding of α1 and α2 A-domain fusion proteins to collagen I and IV was investigated on a BIAcore. BIAevaluation, the kinetic analysis curve-fitting software supplied with the BIAcore, was used to determine the ka and kdvalues. Prior to fitting the association and dissociation phases of the curve, the binding of A-domain to a blank sensor chip was measured and subtracted from the binding curve. Binding to the uncoated surface was negligible. Binding of a range of fusion protein concentrations (3–100 μg/ml) to collagen I and IV-coated chips was measured. Covalent coupling of collagen I to the chip was much more efficient than for collagen IV, and consequently, signals obtained for binding to collagen I were higher than those to collagen IV. Binding of α2 A-domain to collagen IV could be detected using the BIAcore; however, signals were too low to allow accurate curve fitting. Values obtained are shown in Table I. The BIAevaluation software provides a number of statistical parameters to judge the fitting of the binding model to the experimental data. These indicated that a simple association model provided a good approximation to the experimental data; however, residual plots, comparing the fitted data with experimental results, indicated that a more complex interaction may occur.

The cooperativity is characterized by a Hill coefficient of 1.29 ± 0.06, a curved Eadie-Scatchard plot, and activation by low concentrations of competitive inhibitors. The activation also appears to induce a conformational change in the cyclooxygenase site. The cooperativity produces a 2–4-fold greater rate of PGHS2-dependent prostaglandin formation compared with PGHS1-dependent prostaglandin formation at arachidonic acid concentrations below 0.5 μm. A consequence of the PGHS1 cooperativity is that the affinity of many cyclooxygenase inhibitors for PGHS1 decreases in parallel to the activation by arachidonic acid. In contrast, the affinity of these inhibitors for PGHS2 is unaffected by the changes in arachidonic acid concentration. This results in a dramatic difference in PGHS2/PGHS1 selectivity at different arachidonic acid concentrations. Prostaglandins are synthesized by prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS) 1 and 2.

This is consistent with the hypothesis that PGHS1 prefers exogenous arachidonic acid, and PGHS2 prefers endogenous arachidonic acid (12Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chulada and co-workers (14Chaluda P.C. Loftin C.D. Winn V.D. Young D.A. Tiano H.F. Eling T.E. Langenbach R. Arch. Biochem.

They observed that the levels of PGHS1 activities were 3–5-fold higher than those of PGHS2 when 10 μmarachidonic acid was used as substrate. In contrast, PGHS2 activity was up to 5-fold higher when endogenous arachidonic acid was the substrate (14Chaluda P.C. Loftin C.D. Winn V.D. Young D.A. Tiano H.F. Eling T.E. Langenbach R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These observations support the existence of discrete PGHS1 and PGHS2 biosynthetic pathways but give little insight to why PGHS1 has less activity than PGHS2 when utilizing endogenous arachidonic acid.Pharmaceutical research has focused on the selective intervention of PGHS2-dependent prostaglandin formation. Selective PGHS2 inhibition is hypothesized to alleviate the side effects associated with the use of nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and to be useful in treating inflammatory diseases as well as colon cancer and Alzheimer's disease. A number of PGHS2 selective inhibitors have been reported recently including NS-398 and SC-58125 (15Futaki N. Takahashi S. Arai I. Higuchi S. Otomo S. Prostaglandins. 1994; 47: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 16Reitz D.B. Li J.J. Norton M.B. Reinhold E.J. Collins J.T. Anderson G.D. Gregory S.A. Koboldt C.M. Perkins W.E. Seibert K.

However, the degree of selectivity with these inhibitors and others changes dramatically with the assay conditions (17Mitchell J.A. Akarasereenont P. Thiemermann C. Flower R.J. Vane J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 90: 11693-11697Crossref Scopus (1554) Google Scholar).We report here the contribution of an inhibitor-sensitive substrate-dependent cooperative activation of PGHS1 in the functional segregation of PGHS1 and PGHS2 biosynthetic pathways. The allosteric activation appears to induce a conformation change in the PGHS1 cyclooxygenase binding site which causes a loss in PGHS1 affinity for PGHS2-selective inhibitors. Nonselective inhibitors are unaffected. These findings allow us to conclude that the production of prostaglandins is regulated coordinately through transcriptional regulation of PGHS2 activity and allosteric regulation of PGHS1 activity.

Reddy and Herschman (12Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) have proposed at least two independent pathways for prostaglandin synthesis: a secretory phospholipase A2-mediated, PGHS1-dependent transcellular pathway and an intracellular cytosolic phospholipase A2-mediated, PGHS2-dependent pathway. This is consistent with the hypothesis that PGHS1 prefers exogenous arachidonic acid, and PGHS2 prefers endogenous arachidonic acid (12Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chulada and co-workers (14Chaluda P.C. Loftin C.D. Winn V.D. Young D.A. Tiano H.F. Eling T.E. Langenbach R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) quantitated the differences in the rate of prostaglandin formation by PGHS1 and PGHS2 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and Chinese hamster ovary cells with stably expressed enzymes. They observed that the levels of PGHS1 activities were 3–5-fold higher than those of PGHS2 when 10 μmarachidonic acid was used as substrate. In contrast, PGHS2 activity was up to 5-fold higher when endogenous arachidonic acid was the substrate (14Chaluda P.C. Loftin C.D. Winn V.D. Young D.A. Tiano H.F. Eling T.E. Langenbach R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These observations support the existence of discrete PGHS1 and PGHS2 biosynthetic pathways but give little insight to why PGHS1 has less activity than PGHS2 when utilizing endogenous arachidonic acid. Pharmaceutical research has focused on the selective intervention of PGHS2-dependent prostaglandin formation. Selective PGHS2 inhibition is hypothesized to alleviate the side effects associated with the use of nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and to be useful in treating inflammatory diseases as well as colon cancer and Alzheimer's disease. A number of PGHS2 selective inhibitors have been reported recently including NS-398 and SC-58125 (15Futaki N. Takahashi S. Arai I. Higuchi S. Otomo S. Prostaglandins. 1994; 47: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 16Reitz D.B. Li J.J. Norton M.B. Reinhold E.J. Collins J.T. Anderson G.D. Gregory S.A. Koboldt C.M. Perkins W.E. Seibert K. Isakson P.C. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 3878-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, the degree of selectivity with these inhibitors and others changes dramatically with the assay conditions (17Mitchell J.A. Akarasereenont P. Thiemermann C. Flower R.J. Vane J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 90: 11693-11697Crossref Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). We report here the contribution of an inhibitor-sensitive substrate-dependent cooperative activation of PGHS1 in the functional segregation of PGHS1 and PGHS2 biosynthetic pathways. The allosteric activation appears to induce a conformation change in the PGHS1 cyclooxygenase binding site which causes a loss in PGHS1 affinity for PGHS2-selective inhibitors. Nonselective inhibitors are unaffected. These findings allow us to conclude that the production of prostaglandins is regulated coordinately through transcriptional regulation of PGHS2 activity and allosteric regulation of PGHS1 activity.

Multiple signal pathways are activated by binding of these ligands to their receptors, which share a common β subunit. Janus protein kinase 2 (Jak2) binds to the membrane proximal domain of the β chain and is phosphorylated on receptor ligation. To explore the role of Jak2 in the regulation of specific signal transduction pathways, we constructed fusion proteins with a CD16 external domain, a CD7 transmembrane region, and a Jak2 cytoplasmic domain. This cytoplasmic domain consisted either of wild type Jak2 (CD16/Jak2-W) or Jak2 mutations with deletions of (a) the amino terminus (CD16/Jak2-N), (b) kinase-like domain (CD16/Jak2-B), (c) kinase domain (CD16/Jak2-C), or (d) amino-terminal and kinase-like domains, leaving the kinase domain (CD16/Jak-K) intact. In contrast to the CD16/Jak2-W fusion protein, which requires cross-linking for activation, CD16/Jak2-N, CD16/Jak2-B, and CD16/Jak2-K were constitutively phosphorylated, and they stimulated Shc phosphorylation and increased binding of STAT to DNA in Ba/F3 cells. Cell lines derived from IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells stably transfected with CD16/Jak2-W, CD16/Jak2-N, or CD16/Jak2-B mammalian expression vectors died at a rate similar to that of the parental cells on IL-3 deprivation. In contrast, CD16/Jak2-K cell lines exhibited increased expression of bcl-2 and pim-1 mRNA and maintained their viability when compared with control cell lines. Thus, activation of tyrosine phosphorylation by creating a CD16/Jak2-K fusion is sufficient to activate pathways that prevent cell death.

Signal transduction and growth stimulation by GM-CSF, IL-3, 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; FCS, fetal calf serum; Ab, antibody. 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; FCS, fetal calf serum; Ab, antibody. and IL-5 are mediated by a heterodimeric receptor composed of α and β subunits. The α subunit is specific for each cytokine (1Gearing D.P. King J.A. Gough N.M. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), whereas the β subunit is shared in common (2Kitamura T. Sato N. Arai K. Miyajima A. Cell. 1991; 66: 1165-1174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Binding of the growth factors dimerizes the receptor and induces signal transduction pathways that, in turn, cooperate to induce cell growth. However, the mechanisms by which dimerization of the α and β subunits transmit these signals remain unclear. Various pathways, involving Jak-2, Pim-1, c-Myc, c-Fos, c-Jun, and the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase pathway, have been implicated (3Quelle F.W. Sato N. Witthuhn B.A. Inhorn R.C. Eder M. Miyajima A.

Deletion mutagenesis studies suggest that the signal transduction pathways and, perhaps, functional outcomes are specifically associated with the membrane-proximal (1–544) and distal (544–763) regions of the β subunit (3Quelle F.W.

Jak2 is a member of a family of protein kinases composed of Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2 that are characterized by a kinase domain in the carboxyl portion, a kinase-like domain (pseudokinase), and a large amino-terminal domain characterized by seven highly conserved regions (7Firmbach-Kraft I.

However, deletions of specific portions of intracytoplasmic domains of the α subunit can also block GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5 signaling and can inhibit the growth factor-induced activation of Jak2, Pim-1, and c-Myc (16Polotskaya A.

Transfection of cells with dominant negative forms of the Jak2 kinase blocks both erythropoietin-induced mitogenesis and inhibition of apoptosis, suggesting that Jak2 is necessary for both proliferation and prevention of cell death (20Zhuang H.

Although removal of the distal domain of the β subunit does not block IL-3- or GM-CSF-mediated cell growth, the cells undergo apoptosis at a more rapid rate (22Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K.-I. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Transfection of Ras into such cells restores their normal growth pattern. If only a small portion of the β subunit is removed (residues 626–763), then this cell growth defect can also be restored by adding fetal calf serum, which presumably acts through regulation of the Ras pathway (23Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Mutation of tyrosine 750 in the β chain reduces the sensitivity of cells to GM-CSF and decreases the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc (24Inhorn R.C. Carlesso N. Durstin M. Frank D.A. Griffen J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8665-8669Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggesting that this is a docking site for signal transduction molecules. To investigate the role of Jak2 kinase in the regulation of signal transduction pathways, in the absence of other signals generated by the growth factor receptors, we previously fused Jak2 to the external domain of CD16 (the low affinity FcIII IgG receptor) and the transmembrane domain of CD7 (T cell differentiation gp40 protein) (CD16/Jak2) (25Kolanus W. Romeo C. Seed B. Cell. 1993; 74: 171-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 26Sakai I. Nabell L. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18420-18427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This cDNA was encoded in a vaccinia virus that was used to infect growth factor-dependent murine Ba/F3 cells to generate high levels of fusion protein. Cross-linking with anti-CD16 antibody stimulated the kinase activity of the fusion protein but did not cause activation of endogenous Jak2 or phosphorylation of the β chain. Activation of the CD16/Jak2 fusion protein stimulated increased phosphorylation of Shc and p145 (SHIP) (27Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) and increased expression of c-fos, c-jun, and jun-B mRNAs, caused only minor changes in MAP kinase activity, and did not increase cellular levels of c-mycmRNA. We concluded that activation of Jak2 is sufficient to generate some, but not all, of the signals that arise upon binding of growth factors to their receptors in factor-dependent hematopoietic cells. In the present study, we further examined the role of specific domains of the Jak2 protein in individual signal transduction pathways and, by creating deletion mutants of the Jak2 protein and cloning them in frame with CD16/CD7, determined whether activation of Jak2 is sufficient to sustain the growth of hematopoietic cells. Recombinant vaccinia viruses were prepared for rapid, high level expression of the fusion proteins, whereas mammalian expression vectors were used to establish stably transfected cell lines for analysis of biologic effects. Deletion of the amino-terminal two-thirds of the Jak2 protein, leaving only the protein kinase domain, did not change the pattern of signal transduction. However, in contrast to wild type fusion protein, which requires cross-linking for activity, the chimeric protein encoding only the kinase domain was constitutively fully active. In growth factor-deprived stably transfected cell lines, expression of the chimeric protein encoding only the kinase domain resulted in maintenance of cell viability, delayed cell death, and increased expression of pim-1 and bcl-2 mRNA. The construction of the cDNA for CD16/Jak2-W (wild type Jak2) and its cloning into a recombinant vaccinia virus transfer vector have been described previously (26Sakai I. Nabell L. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18420-18427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The cDNA for CD16/Jak2-N (N-terminal deletion) was created by replacing the MluI-NcoI fragment (the region coding for residues 1–717) with a polymerase chain reaction product encoding residues 536–717 with a MluI site in the appropriate reading frame at the 5′ end. The cDNA for CD16/Jak2-B (pseudokinase deletion) was created by removing the BglII-BglII fragment (the region coding for residues 523–746) and religation. The cDNA for CD16/Jak2-C (kinase domain deletion) was made by replacing the NdeI-NotI fragment (the region coding for residues 932–1129) with a polymerase chain reaction product encoding residues 932–999 with a terminal codon and the NotI site at the 3′ end. The cDNA for CD16/Jak2-K (both N-terminal homology domain and kinase-like domain deletion) was created by replacing theMluI-NotI fragment (the entire Jak2 coding region) with a polymerase chain reaction product encoding residues 825–1129 with a MluI site in the appropriate reading frame at the 5′ end and a NotI site at the 3′ end. Correct polymerase chain reaction and cloning were confirmed by dideoxy-DNA sequencing. For establishment of stably transfected cell lines, theHindIII-MluI fragment (the region coding for CD16/CD7) and the MluI-NotI fragment (the region coding for wild type Jak2 or Jak2 deletion mutants) were ligated into aHindIII-NotI site of the pcDNA3 expression plasmid (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Recombinant vaccinia viruses were constructed as described previously (26Sakai I. Nabell L. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18420-18427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recombinant vaccinia virus transfer vector plasmids were introduced into BSC-40 cells by electroporation, followed by infection with wild type vaccinia virus. After a 24-h culture, viruses were harvested. Cells containing recombinant viruses were selected with guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and thymidine kinase selection. The presence of the recombinant vaccinia viruses was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Ba/F3 cells were infected for 1 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with recombinant vaccinia virus at a multiplicity of infection of 100. After a 12-h culture, infected cells were deprived of conditioned medium and incubated for 4 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5% albumin. Cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml of anti-CD16 antibody F(ab′)2 for 2.5 min, followed by incubation at 37 °C with 25 μg/ml anti-mouse IgG F(ab)′2 for the indicated times. The murine IL-3-dependent cell line, Ba/F3, was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, and 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium as a source of IL-3. Ba/F3 cells were transfected by electroporation (960 microfarads; 350 V) with 30 μg of plasmid DNA. Selection with G418 (1 mg/ml) was initiated 48 h after electroporation, and G418-resistant clones were selected by limiting dilution. The expression of the cDNA products was examined by Western blot analysis using anti-Jak2 antibody and flow cytometric analysis using anti-CD16 antibody. The anti-Jak2 antibody used for immunoprecipitation was raised against residues 747–1129 (6Zhao Y. Wagner F. Frank S.J. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13814-13818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The anti-Jak2 antibody raised against residues 758–776 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and the anti-Jak2 antibody (c-20) raised against residues 1110–1129 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-CD16 antibody 3G8 F(ab)′2 was purchased from Medarex, Inc. (Annandale, NJ) and used for cross-linking, immunoprecipitation, and flow cytometric analysis. Anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-STAT1 antibody and affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to Shc were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-STAT3 antibody and anti-STAT5 antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (26Sakai I. Nabell L. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18420-18427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared, and EMSA was carried out as described previously (26Sakai I. Nabell L. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18420-18427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For the supershift assay, 1 μg of specific antibody was added to the nuclear extract. Incubation was carried out at room temperature for 20 min prior to the addition of radiolabeled oligonucleotide. Cells (5 × 104) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium and 10% fetal calf serum in the absence of conditioned medium for 5 h. Cells were either cross-linked with 1 μg of anti-CD16 antibody F(ab)′2 or 10 μg of anti-mouse IgG F(ab)′2 or stimulated with 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium for 17 h. Subsequently, the cells were pulse-labeled with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine for 4 h prior to harvest. Northern blots were carried out as described (26Sakai I. Nabell L. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18420-18427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After hybridization, identical filters were stripped and reprobed with c-Fos, c-Jun, JunB, and α-tubulin. The pim-1 cDNA (1.0-kilobase XhoI/HindIII fragment) and thebcl-2 cDNA were gifts, respectively, of Dr. T. Meeker (University of Kentucky) and Dr. Michael Ruppert (University of Alabama at Birmingham). To explore the possibility that specific signals are regulated by different domains of the Jak2 protein, we deleted specific segments of the protein and fused these deletion mutants in frame with CD16/CD7. The segments deleted were as follows (Fig. 1): the region of the protein that interacts with the β subunit of the receptor located at the amino terminus of the Jak2 protein and encompassing amino acid residues 1–536 (CD16/Jak2-N); the majority of the kinase-like domain, encompassing amino acid residues 522–747 (CD16/Jak2-B); a portion of the kinase domain encompassing amino acid residues 999–1129 (CD16/Jak2-C); and the entire amino-terminal region and the kinase-like domain encompassing residues 1–825 (CD16/Jak2-K) but leaving the kinase domain intact. To obtain rapid, high level expression of the fusion proteins, the cDNAs were cloned into vaccinia virus, which was then used to infect IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 murine hematopoietic cells. The expression of fusion proteins of the correct size was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting using a Jak2-specific antibody (Fig. 2, A and B). On Western blot analysis, the reactivity of antibodies specific for the carboxyl terminus of the kinase-like domain or the Jak2 kinase domain confirmed the expression of the kinase-like domain, but not the kinase domain, in the CD16/Jak2-C fusion protein (Fig. 2, A and B). Fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis using an antibody specific for CD16 demonstrated that the fusion proteins were expressed at equivalent levels on the cell surface (data not shown). Proteins of lower molecular weight, which represent nonglycosylated, intracellular forms of the fusion proteins, were also expressed (Fig. 2 C, major band below the arrow) as described previously (28Yi W.

The levels of intracellular fusion protein appear to correlate with the multiplicity of viral infection. With lower protein expression, similar levels are expressed on the cell surface, but smaller amounts of protein are seen intracellularly (data not shown). Jak2 is autophosphorylated on tyrosines upon ligation of the hematopoietic growth factors by their receptors. To investigate the effect on autophosphorylation caused by deleting specific domains of Jak2, we stripped the Western blot shown in Fig. 2, A andB, and reprobed the filter with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The low molecular weight, intracellular, unglycosylated forms of the CD16/Jak2-N, -B, and K fusion proteins (Fig.2 C, arrows) were constitutively phosphorylated, but their phosphorylation state was unaffected by cross-linking of the fusion proteins. As previously shown, cross-linking of the CD16/Jak2-W fusion protein resulted in phosphorylation of the glycosylated protein (Fig. 2 C, arrow), which was not phosphorylated in the absence of cross-linking. As expected, the CD16/Jak2-C fusion protein, which lacks the kinase domain was not phosphorylated whether cross-linked or not. Autophosphorylation of the glycosylated forms of the CD16/Jak2-N, -B, and -K fusion proteins was not markedly increased by cross-linking. Only the CD16/Jak2-B fusion protein, in which the kinase-like region is deleted, showed a slight increase in phosphorylation on cross-linking. Significantly, although the amounts of protein were equivalent (Fig. 2 A), the level of constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation was greatly enhanced in the CD16/Jak2-K fusion protein compared with the other fusion proteins. To investigate the levels of cellular protein phosphorylation, the identical amounts of cell extracts used to investigate CD16/Jak phosphorylation (Fig. 2, A–C) were subjected to anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. As previously demonstrated, cross-linking of the CD16/Jak2-W fusion protein resulted in the phosphorylation of proteins with molecular masses of 145, 125, 97, 93, 67, and 54 kDa (Fig. 2 D). Proteins of identical molecular weights have been shown to be phosphorylated after the addition of IL-3 and GM-CSF to factor-dependent cell lines (29Duronio V. Clark-Lewis I. Federsppiel B. Wieler J.S. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21856-21863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kanakura Y. Druker B. Cannistra S.A. Furukawa Y. Torimoto Y. Griffin J.D.

Expression of the CD16/Jak2-C fusion protein did not result in significant phosphorylation of these substrates, either constitutively or after cross-linking. In multiple experiments, the base-line phosphorylation in the non-cross-linked CD16/Jak2-W was variable, being similar to the low levels seen in CD16/Jak2-C containing cells. In contrast, the expression of the CD16/Jak2-N, -B, or -K fusion proteins resulted in constitutive phosphorylation of proteins of similar molecular weights to those phosphorylated by activation of the CD16/Jak2-W fusion protein. However, because of the prominent phosphorylation of the CD16/Jak2 fusion proteins, it was not possible to identify all of these substrate proteins in the CD16/Jak2-N- and CD16/Jak2-N-B- containing cells. As demonstrated for the autophosphorylation of CD16/Jak2-B, cross-linking induced a slight increase in the level of substrate phosphorylation. Although identical amounts of cell extracts were loaded on this SDS gel, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of all substrates was greatly enhanced in the cells expressing the CD16/Jak2-K fusion protein. Because the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation were so elevated, it was difficult to identify the molecular weight of the specific phosphorylated protein extracts. Immunoblots carried out using lesser amounts of proteins demonstrated that the identical proteins to those seen in the CD16/Jak-W Ba/F3 cells (molecular mass 145, 125, 97, 93, 67, and 54 kDa) were phosphorylated (data not shown). Therefore, the infection of Ba/F3 cells with a vaccinia virus-expressing fusion protein containing only the kinase domain of Jak2 induced the constitutive phosphorylation of proteins with molecular weights identical to those of the proteins phosphorylated after the addition of GM-CSF. Although the patterns of phosphorylation are complicated, close examination of the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots does not disclose major differences in the range of proteins constitutively phosphorylated by the Jak2 deletion mutants. To determine whether an identical protein is phosphorylated by each of the mutants, Shc protein phosphorylation was examined. Shc is phosphorylated after the binding of hematopoietic growth factors to their receptors, suggesting that Shc is a natural target of the Jak2 cascade of protein kinases. Immunoprecipitation of Shc before and after cross-linking indicated that cross-linking of CD16/Jak2-W, but not the CD16/Jak2-C, fusion protein resulted in phosphorylation of Shc (Fig.3). On the other hand, expression of the CD16/Jak2-N, -B, and -K fusion proteins resulted in constitutive phosphorylation of Shc, which was not increased by cross-linking. The phosphorylation of Shc did not occur simply as a result of fusing a tyrosine kinase to CD16, since the CD16/Zap70, which was expressed at the same level as the other fusion proteins (data not shown), did not highly phosphorylated Shc. The p145 protein, SHIP, which is associated with Shc (27Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), was similarly phosphorylated, requiring cross-linking of the CD16/Jak2 wild type but not the other fusion proteins (data not shown). Reprobing of this Western immunoblot demonstrates that the CD16/Jak2 protein was coimmunoprecipitated with Shc (Fig. 4).Figure 4Association of Shc proteins with CD16/Jak2. The Shc immunoprecipitation anti-phosphotyrosine AB Western blot shown in Fig. 3 was stripped and reprobed with anti-Jak2 Ab.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine whether these fusion proteins could phosphorylate specific members of the STAT family, the activity of individual STAT family members was examined. Individual members of the STAT family of proteins are activated after the addition of specific growth factors to cells (32Azam M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Kreider B.L. Xia M. Quelle F. Basu R. Saris C.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation is mediated by specific members of the Jak family of proteins. These transcription factors require tyrosine phosphorylation for dimerization and DNA binding. The addition of GM-CSF to factor-dependent cell lines stimulates the activity of STAT5 while having no effect on STAT1. To evaluate the specificity of regulation of this family of proteins by the CD16/Jak2 chimera, cell extracts were subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using a interferon-γ activation site or γ-activated site (GAS oligomer) that is capable of binding multiple members of the STAT family (35Decker T.

https://openalex.org/W1995934467,"Heparan sulfate moieties of cell-surface proteoglycans modulate the biological responses to fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). We have reported previously that cell-associated heparan sulfates inhibit the binding of the keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), but enhance the binding of acidic FGF to the KGF receptor, both in keratinocytes, which naturally express this receptor, and in rat myoblasts, which ectopically express it (Reich-Slotky, R., Bonneh-Barkay, D., Shaoul, E., Berman, B., Svahn, C. M., and Ron, D. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 32279–32285). The proteoglycan bearing these modulatory heparan sulfates was purified to homogeneity from salt extracts of rat myoblasts by anion-exchange and FGF affinity chromatography and was identified as rat glypican. Affinity-purified glypican augmented the binding of acidic FGF and basic FGF to human FGF receptor-1 in a cell-free system. This effect was abolished following digestion of glypican by heparinase. Addition of purified soluble glypican effectively replaced heparin in supporting basic FGF-induced cellular proliferation of heparan sulfate-negative cells expressing recombinant FGF receptor-1. In keratinocytes, glypican strongly inhibited the mitogenic response to KGF while enhancing the response to acidic FGF. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that glypican plays an important role in regulating the biological activity of fibroblast growth factors and that, for different growth factors, glypican can either enhance or suppress cellular responsiveness. Heparan sulfate moieties of cell-surface proteoglycans modulate the biological responses to fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). We have reported previously that cell-associated heparan sulfates inhibit the binding of the keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), but enhance the binding of acidic FGF to the KGF receptor, both in keratinocytes, which naturally express this receptor, and in rat myoblasts, which ectopically express it (Reich-Slotky, R., Bonneh-Barkay, D., Shaoul, E., Berman, B., Svahn, C.

Proteoglycans are proteins bearing glycosaminoglycan side chains that exist in the extracellular matrix and on the surface of many cell types. These molecules are thought to play an important role in cell growth, morphogenesis, and cancer (1Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, 2Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13369-13372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most abundant proteoglycans are those that bear glycosaminoglycan chains consisting of heparan sulfate (HS). 1The abbreviations used are: HS, heparan sulfate(s); HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; aFGF, acidic fibroblast growth factor; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; KGF, keratinocyte growth factor; KGFR, keratinocyte growth factor receptor; FCS, fetal calf serum; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) interact with a variety of heparin-binding proteins such as extracellular matrix components and growth factors (1Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, 2Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13369-13372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Cell. 1991; 64: 867-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). Studies in recent years have strongly indicated that HSPGs are important modulators of the activity of heparin-binding growth factors (3Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Cell. 1991; 64: 867-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar), an issue that has been particularly well studied for fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). FGFs constitute a large family of polypeptides that are important in the control of cell growth and differentiation and play a key role in oncogenesis and developmental processes including limb formation, mesoderm induction, and neuronal development (4Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). FGFs elicit their biological activities by interaction with four distinct cell-surface tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFR1–FGFR4) that display overlapping affinities for the various FGFs (5Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). Several members of the receptor family also exist in alternatively spliced forms that display altered ligand binding properties (5Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). For example, the KGF receptor (KGFR) is a splice variant of FGFR2. Whereas FGFR2 interacts with aFGF and bFGF, but not with KGF, KGFR binds aFGF and KGF and exhibits a significantly reduced affinity for bFGF (6Miki T. Bottaro D.P. Fleming T.P. Smith C.L. Burgess W.H. Chan A.M.-L. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfates or heparin can modulate the activities of FGFs by several mechanisms. They can stabilize FGFs by protecting them from proteolysis and thermal denaturation (7Saksela O. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 8Vlodavsky I. Miao H.-Q. Medalion B. Danagher P. Ron D. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). They can also increase the affinity of FGFs for their signaling receptors (8Vlodavsky I. Miao H.-Q. Medalion B.

Cell. 1995; 93: 357-360Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (453) Google Scholar). On the other hand, these molecules can also inhibit the activities of FGFs (14Mali M. Elenius K. Miettinen H.M. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24215-24222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which HS exert these multiple effects are not very well understood. The modulatory effects of the low affinity binding sites were studied mainly with HS extracted from cells or with heparin, which shares structural similarity with HS and thus can mimic the action of cell- or matrix-associated HSPGs (15Spillmann D. Lindahl U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 677-682Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because the level of expression of HSPGs and the ability of cells to synthesize HS side chains of a defined structure are developmentally regulated (16David G. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 17Kato M. Wang H. Bernfield M. Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol.

Science. 1993; 260: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), it is critical to identify the core proteins bearing such modulatory side chains, to elucidate whether the cores influence the structure and function of the glycosaminoglycans attached to them, and to determine the structural requirements for growth factor interaction with the HS moiety. Until now, most of the attempts were concentrated on the identification of native HSPGs that modulate interaction of bFGF with FGFR1. Perlecan, the large basal lamina proteoglycan, was identified as a major candidate for the bFGF low affinity accessory receptor (19Aviezer D. Hecht M. Safran M. Eisinger G. Yayon A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1005-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). In addition, syndecans and glypican can either inhibit or stimulate bFGF/FGFR1 interactions and signaling depending on the cell type in which they are expressed or their level of expression (14Mali M. Elenius K. Miettinen H.M. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24215-24222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Aviezer D. Levy E. Safran M. Svahn C. Buddecke E. Schmidt A. David G.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Little is known about the identity of HSPGs that bind and modulate the activities of other members of the FGF family. In a previous study, we reported that cell-associated HSPGs exert a differential effect on the binding of KGF and aFGF to KGFR (22Reich-Slotky R. Bonneh-Barkay D. Shaoul E. Bluma B. Svahn C.M. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32279-32285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which binds both growth factors equally well (23Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Ron D. Finch P.W. Florio C. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12767-12770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, treatment of cells with a metabolic inhibitor of sulfation or with HS-degrading enzymes reduced the binding of aFGF to KGFR, but enhanced the binding of KGF. Addition of heparin reversed the effect (22Reich-Slotky R. Bonneh-Barkay D. Shaoul E. Bluma B. Svahn C.M. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32279-32285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This differential effect was observed both in keratinocytes, which naturally express KGFR, and in the rat myoblast cell line L6E9, which ectopically expresses this receptor (22Reich-Slotky R. Bonneh-Barkay D. Shaoul E. Bluma B. Svahn C.M. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32279-32285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study was carried out to identify the proteoglycan that may be responsible for this effect. Here, we report the purification of such a proteoglycan from rat myoblasts and its identification as glypican (24Karthikeyan L. Maurel P. Rauch U. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We show that glypican exerts either a stimulatory or an inhibitory activity that is dependent on the type of growth factor. Recombinant aFGF, bFGF, and KGF were produced in bacteria as described (25Ron D. Bottaro D.P. Finch P.W. Morris D. Rubin J.S. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol.

The rat myoblast cell line L6E9 and L6E9 cells transfected with KGFR (27Ron D. Reich R. Chedid M. Lengel C. Cohen O.E. Chan A.M.-L. Neufeld G. Miki T. Tronick S.R. J. Biol.

Herberman R.B. Sakurai M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4355-4359PubMed Google Scholar). A soluble extracellular domain of the short isoform of human FGFR1 (hR1 (31Eisemann A. Ahn J.A. Graziani G. Tronick S.R. Ron D. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1195-1202PubMed Google Scholar)) was cloned into the APtag vector to produce an in-frame fusion of hR1 with secreted placental alkaline phosphatase (32Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). This plasmid was cotransfected with the selectable NeoR marker into NIH/3T3 cells. Conditioned medium from G418-resistant colonies was screened for alkaline phosphatase activity (32Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The clone that produced the highest level of activity was expanded and used to purify the hR1/alkaline phosphatase fusion protein using bFGF affinity chromatography. Purified glypican and FGFs were radioiodinated using chloramine T (33Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar) as described previously (27Ron D. Reich R. Chedid M. Lengel C. Cohen O.E. Chan A.M.-L. Neufeld G. Miki T. Tronick S.R. J. Biol.

Radiolabeled glypican was separated from free iodine by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, and radiolabeled FGFs were purified by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography (34Yuen S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Specific activities of iodinated proteins were in the range of 1–2.5 × 105 cpm/ng. Subconfluent cultures in 24-well plates were subjected to a binding assay as described previously (22Reich-Slotky R. Bonneh-Barkay D. Shaoul E. Bluma B. Svahn C.M. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32279-32285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,27Ron D. Reich R. Chedid M. Lengel C. Cohen O.E. Chan A.M.-L. Neufeld G. Miki T. Tronick S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5388-5394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding sites were distinguished as low or high affinity by salt washes at neutral or low pH, respectively (0.5 m NaCl for KGF and 1 m NaCl for aFGF) (22Reich-Slotky R. Bonneh-Barkay D. Shaoul E. Bluma B. Svahn C.M. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32279-32285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of FGFs to soluble FGFR1 (hR1/alkaline phosphatase) was assessed following covalent cross-linking. Affinity-purified hR1/alkaline phosphatase (0.15 alkaline phosphatase A units/min) was incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature in 50 μl of HEPES binding buffer (100 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 8.8 mm dextrose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) containing 2 ng/ml radioiodinated FGF. Cross-linking was performed with 0.2 mm disuccinimidyl suberate for 30 min. The reaction was quenched by adding 20 mm glycine, and ligand-receptor complexes were visualized following SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Coupling of the growth factors to Sepharose CL-2B (Sigma) was done as described previously (35Wilchek M. Miron T. Biochem. Int. 1982; 4: 629-635Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mg of growth factor (aFGF, bFGF, or KGF) was coupled to 1 ml of packed beads in the presence of 1 mg of heparin. Following coupling, the column was extensively washed with 3 m NaCl to remove heparin and was stored in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 0.5m NaCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Coupling efficiency in different preparations was between 35 and 80%. Subconfluent cultures of L6E9 cells (100–200 tissue culture dishes of 150-mm diameter) were maintained for 16 h in nutrient mixture F-12 containing 10% dialyzed FCS. A portion of the cultures was metabolically labeled with Na235SO4 (30 μCi/ml). Peripheral membrane proteins were extracted with HEPES binding buffer containing 1.5 m NaCl, and the extracts were pooled and concentrated 5–10 times in dialysis tubing with dry polyethylene glycol and dialyzed overnight against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, and 0.2m NaCl. The dialyzed material was applied to a 20-ml DEAE-Sephacel column (Sigma) pre-equilibrated with 10 mmTris, pH 7.0, and 0.2 m NaCl, and the column was washed with 10–20 volumes of Tris buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl. Elution of the bound material was performed with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.4–1.2 m NaCl in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0) at a flow rate of 24 ml/h. Radiolabeled proteoglycan peaks were identified by measuring the radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter, by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, or by safranin O staining (36Lammi M. Tammi M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Samples containing HSPGs were identified following nitrous acid deamination and solid-phase assay on cationic nylon (Zeta-probe) as described (37Rapraeger A. Yeaman C. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Fractions containing HSPGs were pooled, diluted to reduce the salt concentration to 0.2 m, and applied to a 4-ml aFGF affinity column. The column was extensively washed with 0.2 m NaCl, and elution was performed by a stepwise increase in the NaCl concentration (see below). Enzymatic deglycosylation was carried out in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 125I-HSPG and 0.5 unit/ml heparinases I and III or chondroitinase ABC. Incubation was for 2 h at 37 °C. Deaminitive scission of HS with HNO2 was performed as described (38Soroka C.J. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Anhydrous trifluoromethanesulfonic acid was used to strip the peripheral sugars (39Edge A.S.B. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6893-6898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The core protein of the HSPG was digested overnight with proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml). To ensure that digestion was complete, a parallel incubation was carried out in the presence of radioiodinated HSPG, and digestion was monitored by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The GAG side chains were then separated from the protein and degradation products by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. Affinity-purified HSPG was digested with modified trypsin (Promega). The peptides were loaded onto DEAE-Sephacel in the presence of 0.2 m NaCl to absorb GAG-containing peptides. Non-absorbed peptides were resolved by reverse-phase HPLC on a 1-mm diameter Vydac C18 column. The peptides were sequenced using standard chemistry on an Applied Biosystems sequencer (Model 476A). Mass spectrometry was done using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight apparatus (Fisons Instruments, Inc.). Safranin O dye, which reacts with carboxyl and sulfate groups and can detect nanogram amounts of sulfated GAGs (36Lammi M. Tammi M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), was occasionally used to monitor GAG content during purification. For the biological assays, we normalized the concentration of glypican HS relative to known concentrations of heparin on the basis of their sulfate content using the dimethylmethylene blue assay (40Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barrett A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2907) Google Scholar). We estimated that glypican HS contain ∼50% of the sulfate content of heparin. Balb/MK cells, plated on fibronectin (1 μg/cm2)-coated 96-well microtiter plates, were serum-starved for 48 h and incubated with growth factors for 16 h. BaF3 cells were washed three times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, placed in 96-well microtiter plates (2 × 104 cells/well) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS, and incubated with growth factors for 36 h. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was assayed as described previously (29Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 41Reich-Slotky R. Shaoul E. Berman B. Graziani G. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29813-29818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Each point in the experiment was done in duplicate or triplicate, and the results are representative of at least four different experiments. HSPGs exist either as integral or peripheral membrane proteins or as part of the extracellular matrix (1Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, 42Vlodavsky I. Bar-Shavit R. Ishai-Michaeli R. Bashkin P. Fuks Z. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 268-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). To determine the mode of association of the HSPG with parental L6E9 cells, we treated L6E9 cells expressing KGFR (designated L6/KGFR cells) with increasing concentrations of salt, a condition that is known to remove peripheral membrane proteins. L6/KGFR cells were then assayed for binding of radioiodinated aFGF and KGF. We reasoned that if the HSPG is salt-extractable, its removal should differentially affect the binding of aFGF and KGF to KGFR. As shown in Fig. 1, extraction of L6/KGFR cells with increasing salt concentrations resulted in a progressive reduction of the binding of aFGF to both low (Fig.1 A) and high (Fig. 1 B) affinity receptors. In samples that were extracted at 1.5 m NaCl, the binding of aFGF to low and high affinity receptors was reduced by 60 and 80%, respectively. By contrast, salt extraction enhanced the binding of KGF to KGFR by up to 1.6-fold (Fig. 1 B), whereas little or no effect was observed with respect to binding to low affinity receptors (Fig. 1 A). These results are in accordance with our previous observations obtained following treatment of L6/KGFR cells with heparan sulfate-degrading enzymes or with a metabolic inhibitor of sulfation (22Reich-Slotky R. Bonneh-Barkay D. Shaoul E. Bluma B. Svahn C.M. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32279-32285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and further suggest that the differential effect on the binding of aFGF and KGF to KGFR is mediated by a peripheral membrane HSPG. The lack of reduction of the binding of KGF to low affinity receptors in the salt-extracted cells is probably due to the presence of non-heparan sulfate-binding sites, which account for >90% of the low affinity sites for KGF in L6E9 cells (22Reich-Slotky R. Bonneh-Barkay D. Shaoul E. Bluma B. Svahn C.M. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32279-32285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The putative HSPG was purified from salt extracts of parental L6E9 cells that were metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate. Purification was carried out by anion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel followed by affinity chromatography on an aFGF column. The elution profile from DEAE-Sephacel is shown in Fig. 2 A. Over 99% of the material was bound to the column as judged by the negligible amount of radioactivity in the flow-through fraction, and the material eluted at salt concentrations of up to 0.4 m NaCl. A major peak of 35S eluted at ∼0.6 m NaCl. This peak contained predominantly heparan sulfates as judged by its sensitivity to deaminitive cleavage with nitrous acid (Fig. 2 A). The eluted material migrated on SDS-PAGE as a broad band of ∼200 kDa (Fig. 2 A, inset). The fractions containing heparan sulfates were pooled and subjected to aFGF affinity chromatography. About 80% of the pooled material bound to the column and could be eluted by 0.75–1 m NaCl (Fig. 2 B). SDS-PAGE and silver staining of the eluted material revealed the presence of a broad high molecular mass band similar to that observed with the 35S-labeled DEAE fractions (Fig. 2 C). The material purified by aFGF affinity chromatography also bound to bFGF and KGF columns (data not shown). This ability to interact with all three growth factors is in agreement with the previously described ligand binding characteristics of L6E9 HSPG (22Reich-Slotky R. Bonneh-Barkay D. Shaoul E. Bluma B. Svahn C.M. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32279-32285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic and chemical deglycosylations were carried out to characterize the GAG side chain of the purified material and to determine the molecular mass of the core protein. To increase the sensitivity of detection, the core protein was radioiodinated. Fig. 3 A shows the results of enzymatic deglycosylation carried out with heparinase I/III or chondroitinase ABC treatment. Heparinase, which specifically cleaves heparan sulfates, shifted the molecular mass of the broad band to a single band of ∼64 kDa (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). No shift in molecular mass was detected following treatment with chondroitinase ABC of either the intact HSPG or the preparation that had been treated with heparan sulfate-degrading enzymes (Fig.3 A, lanes 2 and 4). Fig. 3 B shows the results of chemical deglycosylation. Deaminitive cleavage with nitrous acid resulted in a shift in the molecular mass of the HSPG that was similar to that observed following treatment with heparinase (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). Treatment with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid further shifted the molecular mass of the HSPG to 54 kDa (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). We conclude that the purified HSPG does not carry chondroitin sulfate and that heparan sulfates account for about two-thirds of the mass of the protein. The results obtained with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid indicate that other types of glycosylations account for ∼10 kDa of the molecular mass. The purified HSPG was digested with modified trypsin; GAG-containing peptides were removed by absorption to DEAE-Sephacel; and GAG-free peptides were resolved by reverse-phase HPLC. Analysis of two peptides gave the sequences LSDVPQAEISGEHLR and QAEALRPFGDAPR. A search in the GenBank™ using the Blast program revealed that the above sequences are identical to residues 46–60 and 195–207 of rat glypican, respectively (24Karthikeyan L. Maurel P. Rauch U. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that even though the peptide encompassing residues 46–60 contains the consensus sequence for GAG attachment (24Karthikeyan L. Maurel P. Rauch U. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), this peptide is apparently not glycosylated. Mass spectrometry of several additional peptides confirmed that the purified HSPG is glypican (data not shown). Furthermore, the purified HSPG was immunoreactive with antibodies directed against bacterially expressed rat glypican, whereas no recognition was observed using antibodies against syndecan-1 and fibroglycan (Fig. 4). It is well established that heparin potentiates the binding of FGFs to FGFR1 and is required for receptor-mediated signaling (8Vlodavsky I. Miao H.-Q. Medalion B. Danagher P. Ron D.

We therefore compared the ability of affinity-purified glypican and heparin to promote FGF receptor binding and mitogenic activity. Binding of bFGF and aFGF to FGFR1 was assayed in a cell-free system utilizing a soluble extracellular domain of human FGFR1 fused to alkaline phosphatase. As shown in Fig. 5, glypican augmented the binding of bFGF and aFGF to FGFR1 at concentrations as low as 10 and 25 ng/ml, respectively. Quantitation of the results from several experiments showed that both glypican and heparin gave a similar 4–6-fold augmentation of bFGF binding, whereas heparin was somewhat more effectiv"

One KH domain protein of unknown function, vigilin (also known as the high density lipoprotein-binding protein), contains 14 KH domains and is ubiquitous in vertebrate cells. We previously used RNA gel mobility shift assays to describe an estrogen-inducible protein which binds specifically to a segment of the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of vitellogenin mRNA, an area which has been implicated in the estrogen-mediated stabilization of vitellogenin mRNA. Here we show that the vitellogenin mRNA-binding protein (VitRNABP) is vigilin. The VitRNABP was isolated as a 150–155-kDa protein on a vitellogenin mRNA 3′-UTR affinity column. Peptide microsequencing revealed that the purified protein was vigilin, a conclusion confirmed in Western blot analysis with antibodies to vigilin. Direct confirmation that vigilin is the VitRNABP was obtained from RNA gel mobility shift assays which demonstrated that antibodies to chicken vigilin supershifted the Xenopus VitRNABP band.Xenopus liver vigilin mRNA and the VitRNABP exhibited similar induction by estrogen, providing additional confirmation that vigilin is the estrogen-inducible protein which binds to the 3′-UTR of estrogen-stabilized vitellogenin mRNA. These data support a role for vigilin in the hormonal control of mRNA metabolism. RNA-binding proteins containing KH domains are widely distributed.

These data support a role for vigilin in the hormonal control of mRNA metabolism. Post-transcriptional events including nuclear RNA processing and export, localization of RNA within the cell, degradation and stabilization of RNAs, and mRNA translation are increasingly seen as important cellular regulatory sites, whose alteration can contribute to disease states. These processes are largely mediated by RNA-binding proteins (1Nagai K. Mattaj I.W. RNA-Protein Interactions. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994Google Scholar). One important and widely distributed class of RNA-binding proteins contains K homology (KH) 1The abbreviations used are: KH, K homology; FPLC, fast performance liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin; VitRNABP, vitellogenin mRNA-binding protein; HDL-BP, high density lipoprotein-binding protein; UTR, untranslated region; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: KH, K homology; FPLC, fast performance liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin; VitRNABP, vitellogenin mRNA-binding protein; HDL-BP, high density lipoprotein-binding protein; UTR, untranslated region; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid. domains (2Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). This class of proteins includes such biologically significant KH domain-containing proteins as the FMR protein, which is involved in Fragile X mental retardation (3Siomi H. Siomi M.C. Nussbaum R.L. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1993; 74: 291-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), the Drosophila bicaudal C protein which is important in development (4Mahone M. Saffman E.E. Lasko P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2043-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and the α-poly(C)-binding protein which is found in the α-globin mRNA ribonucleoprotein complex (5Kiledjian M. Wang X. Liebhaber S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4357-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). One notable but little understood KH domain protein is vigilin (also identified as the human high density lipoprotein-binding protein, HDL-BP), a ubiquitous, highly conserved protein with 14 KH domains (6Schmidt C.

Since vigilin has been found in all cell lines and tissues examined (8Neu-Yilik G. Zorbas H. Gloe T.R. Raabe H.M. Hopp-Christensen T.A. Müller P.K. Eur. J.

Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2360-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and its 14 KH domains represent the largest number of KH domains in any known protein (3Siomi H. Siomi M.C.

Cell. 1996; 85: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), it likely plays an important role in RNA metabolism. While vigilin has been used as a model protein in solving the structure of a KH domain uncomplexed to RNA (12Musco G. Stier G. Joseph C. Antonietta M. Morelli C. Nilges M. Gibson T.J. Pastore A. Cell. 1996; 85: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), its RNA binding properties have been elusive, and its function(s) have remained obscure. We have been studying a protein which binds to a segment of the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of the mRNA encoding the egg yolk precursor protein, vitellogenin. In male Xenopus liver, vitellogenin mRNA levels increase >10,000-fold following estrogen administration (13Brock M.L. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 258: 5449-5455Google Scholar, 14Brock M.L. Shapiro D.J. Cell. 1983; 34: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The estrogen-mediated induction of vitellogenin mRNA is brought about both by an increase in the rate of vitellogenin gene transcription and by stabilization of cytoplasmic vitellogenin mRNA (13Brock M.L. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 258: 5449-5455Google Scholar, 14Brock M.L. Shapiro D.J. Cell. 1983; 34: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Hepatic vitellogenin mRNA is degraded with a half-life of 16 h in the absence of estrogen, and 500 h following addition of estrogen to the culture medium (14Brock M.L. Shapiro D.J. Cell. 1983; 34: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The estrogen-mediated stabilization of vitellogenin mRNA requires association of the mRNA with ribosomes (15Blume J.E. Shapiro D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9003-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and involves the 3′-UTR of the mRNA (16Nielsen D.A. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We identified a protein which binds specifically to a segment of the 3′-UTR of vitellogenin mRNA in an estrogen-inducible manner and named it the vitellogenin mRNA 3′-UTR-binding protein (VitRNABP) (17Dodson R.E. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3130-3138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Dodson R.E. Acena M.R. Shapiro D.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 52: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Here we describe the isolation of the VitRNABP and demonstrate by several criteria that this protein is Xenopus vigilin. A protein mixture from salt-extracted polysomes from livers of estrogen-treated maleXenopus laevis was prepared as we have described (17Dodson R.E. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3130-3138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pB1-15pA used in affinity chromatography was made by cloning theHindIII-DraI fragment of pB1-15 (17Dodson R.E. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3130-3138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into theHindIII-SmaI site of pSP64pA (Promega). B1-15pA RNA was made by in vitro transcription from the SP6 promoter of the pB1-15pA vector linearized with EcoRI yielding a 146-nucleotide RNA. Poly(U)-agarose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) were prepared by rinsing (i) once in 4 volumes of water, (ii) once in wash buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.05 m NaCl), and (iii) six times in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 m LiCl). pB1-15pA RNA (approximately 4 μg of RNA/μl of beads) was added to the beads in 2 volumes of binding buffer and allowed to hybridize for 5–6 h at room temperature. The beads were kept in suspension by rotation. The beads were washed twice in hybridization buffer (HB) (6 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 6% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm magnesium acetate) with 50 mm NaCl and once in HB with 50 mm NaCl containing 1 μg/μl yeast tRNA, 1 μg/μl heparin, 0.3 unit/μl RNasin, and protease inhibitors (17Dodson R.E. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3130-3138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The beads were then incubated with the polysome extract in HB with tRNA, heparin, RNasin, and protease inhibitors with 200 μg of polysome extract per 20 μl of beads in a 300-μl total volume for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were then washed in buffer containing 200 mm KCl, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Proteins were eluted in the above buffer containing 500 mm KCl. Eluted proteins were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205516) Google Scholar) and visualized using a silver stain (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.2. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar). For microsequencing, resolved proteins were transferred to a ProBlott membrane (Applied Biosystems) in 10 mm CAPS, pH 10, with 10% methanol at 50 V for 3 h and stained in Amido Black (21Fernandez J. Andrews S. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The 150-kDa protein was cut from the membrane and sent to the Rockefeller University Technology Center (New York, NY) for digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C and internal sequencing (21Fernandez J. Andrews S. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). For FPLC analysis, protein extracts were concentrated using Microcon 30 or 50 filters to about 0.25 original volume. Protein (1.2 mg) was loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia) and resolved using a Pharmacia FPLC System at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 4 °C. A total of 25 ml of buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was used to elute proteins in 0.5-ml fractions. Proteins eluting from the column were monitored at 280 nm. Fractions were assayed using the RNA gel mobility shift assay, and band intensities were determined using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) or a densitometer. Total RNA was isolated from livers of control or estrogen-treated X. laevis as described (22Baker H.J. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8434-8438Google Scholar). RNA was resolved on a 0.75% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to a Nytran membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) and hybridized to cDNA probes as described (23Barton M.C. Shapiro D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7119-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). cDNA was radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP by nick translation or random priming using standard methods (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.2. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar). Ribosomal RNA band intensity was used to control for loading of samples. Intensities of labeled bands were determined using a PhosphorImager. Oligonucleotides for PCR were made to two conserved regions in the 5′ portion of vigilin corresponding to nucleotide numbers 213–243 and 315–340 in the chicken vigilin sequence (GenBankTM accession numberX65292) (6Schmidt C.

Xenopus liver RNA (10 μg) was PCR-amplified using the above oligonucleotides (24White B. PCR Protocols, Methods in Molecular Biology.15. Humana Press Inc., Lake Clifton, NJ1994Google Scholar), gel-purified, and radiolabeled by nick translation. The labeled 128-nucleotide cDNA was used to screen a X. laevis liver cDNA library (25Pastori R.L. Moskaitis J.E. Smith Jr., L.H. Schoenberg D.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2599-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A positive clone was identified, plaque-purified, and excised, and its 980 nucleotide insert was subcloned into pGEM3 (Promega). This clone is referred to as pVIG10. Gel mobility shift assays were performed as we have described (17Dodson R.E. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3130-3138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Antiserum (42 μg) was added to the hybridization mixture in the absence of RNA probe for 45 min at 4 °C. RNA probe was then added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 45 min before gel analysis. Rabbit antibody to a segment of recombinant vigilin was a kind gift from Drs. S. Kügler and P. K. Müller (26Kügler S. Grünweller A. Probst C. Klinger M. Müller P.K. Kruse C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-BSA was a gift from S. Miklasz. Western blot analysis was done as described previously (27Wren C.K. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), except that sodium azide was not added to buffers, SDS (0.1%) was added to the transfer buffer, and blots were transferred at 60 mA (14 V) overnight at 4 °C. Anti-vigilin antiserum was diluted 1:1500 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit second antibody (EY Laboratories) was used at a 1:2000 dilution. Bands were visualized with an ECL kit (Amersham). We described the VitRNABP as an estrogen-inducible protein which bound to a segment of the vitellogenin mRNA 3′-UTR in RNA gel mobility shift assays and in UV cross-linking experiments (17Dodson R.E. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3130-3138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used RNA affinity chromatography to isolate the VitRNABP. A 94-nucleotide segment of the vitellogenin mRNA 3′-UTR with a 30-nucleotide poly(A) tail, which is efficiently bound by the VitRNABP, was immobilized on poly(U)-agarose beads by hybridization. A salt extract of polysomes prepared from the livers of 14-day estrogen-treated male X. laevis was incubated with the RNA affinity column, and control extracts were incubated with the poly(U)-agarose. Bound proteins were eluted in 500 mm salt and resolved on an SDS-PAGE gel. As shown in Fig. 1 A, a predominant protein band of approximately 150–155 kDa, which appeared as a very closely spaced doublet, was eluted from the agarose beads containing the vitellogenin mRNA segment (Fig. 1 A, lane 2), but not from control poly(U)-agarose beads (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). RNA binding activity and the presence of the 150–155-kDa band were well correlated since the eluate from the B1-15pA RNA beads, but not the eluate from the poly(U) beads, bound RNA in the RNA gel mobility shift assay (data not shown). We next determined whether the vitellogenin mRNA 3′-UTR binding activity was in the same 150–155-kDa molecular mass range as the protein purified by the RNA affinity column. Since we have been unable to reconstitute mRNA binding after denaturing the protein, we size-fractionated a concentrated polysome extract under native conditions. Proteins eluted from the FPLC sizing column were assayed using the RNA gel mobility shift assay. As shown in Fig.2, peak binding activity corresponded to a molecular mass range of 145–190 kDa, which was consistent with the 150–155-kDa protein being the VitRNABP. The 150–155-kDa protein was enriched by RNA affinity chromatography (Fig.1 A), size-fractionated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a membrane, and submitted for microsequencing. Internal sequencing of one of the peptide fragments yielded the sequence; N(R/V)IRIEQDPQXVQQA. This sequence was used to search a protein sequence data base (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package of the Genetics Computer Group). Twelve out of fifteen amino acids were identical to those in chicken vigilin (amino acids 478–492) (6Schmidt C. Henkel B. Pöschl E. Zorbas H. Purschke W.G. Gloe T.R. Müller P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and the human HDL-BP (amino acids 479–493) (7McKnight G.L. Reasoner J. Gilbert T. Sundquist K.O. Hokland B. McKernan P.A. Champagne J. Johnson C.J. Bailey M.C. Holly R. O'Hara P.J. Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12131-12141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since vigilin and HDL-BP are the independently identified avian and human forms of the same protein, we subsequently refer to this protein as vigilin. To verify that the protein we purified as the VitRNABP was vigilin, a second peptide was sequenced. The sequence of this peptide, VI(S/T)QIR had a 5- out of 6-amino acid match with both the chicken and human sequences, confirming that the protein sequenced was vigilin. To ensure that the isolated protein was Xenopus vigilin, a Western blot of the protein from the RNA affinity beads was probed with antibodies to a segment of recombinant chicken vigilin, expressed inEscherichia coli and affinity-purified (26Kügler S. Grünweller A. Probst C. Klinger M. Müller P.K. Kruse C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In Western blots using crude polysome extracts, the antibody reacts with a single protein (Fig. 1 B, lane 1) which is the same size as the protein shown to be vigilin by microsequencing. The protein eluted from the B1-15pA affinity beads is also specifically recognized by the antibody (Fig. 1 B, lane 2) and on shorter exposures can be seen to be a doublet (data not shown). Although this is a polyclonal antibody, in agreement with previous reports (26Kügler S. Grünweller A. Probst C. Klinger M. Müller P.K. Kruse C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we see no cross-reactivity with other proteins. Since the elution pattern was identical in both the SDS-PAGE gels and Western blots, we were confident that the isolated protein was indeed vigilin. While these data demonstrated that the protein purified by affinity chromatography was vigilin, and that vigilin was approximately the same size as the VitRNABP, it was still important to directly establish that the protein bound to the vitellogenin mRNA 3′-UTR in our gel mobility shift assays was vigilin. If the VitRNABP was indeedXenopus vigilin, antibodies to vigilin added to the RNA gel mobility shift assays should alter the mobility of the VitRNABP·RNA complex. In an RNA gel mobility shift assay, the VitRNABP in a polysome extract formed a specific complex with a radiolabeled probe containing a segment of the vitellogenin mRNA 3′-UTR (Fig.3 A, lane 2). Addition of antibody to vigilin supershifted this complex (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). Since this is a polyclonal antibody, the number of antibody molecules that can bind to each gel-shifted complex is variable, and some tailing of the supershifted band is observed (Fig. 3 A,lane 4 and Fig. 3 B, lane 2). This supershift was specific for anti-vigilin, since it did not occur when a control antibody to bovine serum albumin was used (Fig. 3 A,lane 6). Control experiments also showed that the antibodies alone did not interact with the RNA probe (Fig. 3 A,lanes 3 and 5). By increasing the ratio of anti-vigilin antibody to polysome extract, we were able to almost completely supershift the VitRNABP·RNA complex (Fig. 3 B), indicating that vigilin is present in all of the complexes with the vitellogenin mRNA 3′-UTR segment. Since we had previously reported that the VitRNABP was estrogen-inducible (17Dodson R.E. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3130-3138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whetherXenopus vigilin mRNA was also regulated by estrogen. We therefore isolated and sequenced a 980-nucleotide Xenopusvigilin cDNA clone (see “Experimental Procedures”) with a high homology to sequences at the 5′-end of chicken and human vigilin. TheXenopus vigilin cDNA showed a 74% and 76% nucleotide identity with the chicken and human vigilin cDNAs, respectively, and an 86% identity to amino acid sequences from both species. To compare the regulation of Xenopus vigilin mRNA levels and vitellogenin mRNA 3′-UTR binding activity, three animals each were treated with vehicle or estrogen, total RNA was isolated from half the liver, and whole cell protein extracts were prepared from the other half. Consistent with our earlier work (17Dodson R.E. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3130-3138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Dodson R.E. Acena M.R. Shapiro D.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 52: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), binding activity in RNA gel shift assays from liver extracts from estrogen-inducedXenopus liver was about 3-fold higher than in control extracts (Fig. 4 B). In agreement with the RNA gel shift data, Northern blot analysis showed that a predominant 5.7-kilobase vigilin mRNA was induced 2–3-fold after estrogen administration (Fig. 4, A and B). Its broad distribution and the presence of 14 KH domains suggested an important, but unidentified, role for vigilin in RNA metabolism. In this work we show that vigilin is the estrogen-inducible protein we previously demonstrated binds to a segment of the vitellogenin mRNA 3′-UTR. This conclusion is supported by our findings that: vigilin is retained on a vitellogenin mRNA 3′-UTR affinity column; in gel shift assays, vigilin antiserum binds to the VitRNABP; the mRNA binding activity and vigilin are approximately the same size; and both are induced by estrogen. We now refer to the VitRNABP as vigilin. Vigilin has been proposed to be an RNA-binding protein because of its numerous KH domains (3Siomi H. Siomi M.C. Nussbaum R.L. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1993; 74: 291-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) but to date had only been shown to bind tRNA (28Kruse C. Grünweller A. Notbohn H. Kügler S. Purschke W.G. Müller P.K. Biochimie. 1996; 320: 247-252Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our work demonstrates for the first time that vigilin can bind to an mRNA. We previously reported that the affinity for the vitellogenin mRNA 3′-UTR was orders of magnitude greater than that for tRNA (17Dodson R.E. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3130-3138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since vigilin is present in a wide variety of tissues and cell types and is regulated by diverse factors, it almost certainly binds to RNAs other than vitellogenin mRNA. The relative binding affinity of vigilin for different RNA sequences may play a role in its function in different tissues. The exact determinants of RNA binding specificity remain to be determined and may involve specific KH domains within vigilin and proteins which associate with vigilin. The nucleic acid binding properties of individual KH domains vary (29Dejgaard K. Leffers H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The 14 KH domains in vigilin may therefore interact on different RNA templates to create different binding surfaces, allowing vigilin to bind to a diverse array of RNAs. It is possible that other proteins may associate with the vigilin·RNA complex and play a role in creating binding specificity. Although other proteins which might play a role in RNA binding are not yet identified, there are several minor proteins in the vitellogenin mRNA affinity column eluent which may contribute to this function. The ability of vigilin to bind the vitellogenin mRNA 3′-UTR suggests that it may be involved in mRNA stabilization. Since the 3′-UTR of vitellogenin mRNA is critical for estrogen-mediated stabilization (16Nielsen D.A. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and vigilin is the major protein which binds to this region (17Dodson R.E. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3130-3138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have proposed that vigilin is involved in the stabilization of the message. Other KH domain-containing proteins have been shown to be involved in RNA stabilization (5Kiledjian M. Wang X. Liebhaber S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4357-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and vigilin has been reported to protect tRNA from RNase (28Kruse C. Grünweller A. Notbohn H. Kügler S. Purschke W.G. Müller P.K. Biochimie. 1996; 320: 247-252Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Other functions have been proposed for vigilin based on its intracellular distribution (26Kügler S. Grünweller A. Probst C. Klinger M. Müller P.K. Kruse C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Additional studies will be required to determine the role of vigilin in mRNA stabilization and any additional functions it may serve. While a clear role for vigilin has not been established, its tight regulation accentuates its importance in RNA metabolism. We have shown that vigilin levels are increased by estrogen in liver (Fig. 4 and Refs. 17Dodson R.E. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3130-3138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 18Dodson R.E. Acena M.R. Shapiro D.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 52: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and by testosterone in muscle, and that it is decreased by testosterone in testis (18Dodson R.E. Acena M.R. Shapiro D.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 52: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Our findings are consistent with reports in several experimental models that vigilin can be regulated by several factors and that increased levels of vigilin correlate with increased protein production (8Neu-Yilik G. Zorbas H. Gloe T.R. Raabe H.M. Hopp-Christensen T.A. Müller P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 9Plenz G. Gan Y. Raabe H.M. Müller P.K.

Kruse C. Müller P.K. Kühnel W. Ann. Anat. Anatomischer Anzeiger. 1996; 178: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Vigilin has been localized immunocytochemically to polysomes (8Neu-Yilik G. Zorbas H. Gloe T.R. Raabe H.M. Hopp-Christensen T.A. Müller P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and we have extracted vigilin from liver polysomes indicating its association with cytoplasmic RNA. In a situation such as the estrogen-induced liver inXenopus, where vitellogenin is 50% of the total cellular mRNA (31Shapiro D.J. Barton M.C. McKearin D.M. Chang T.-C. Lew D. Blume J. Nielsen D.A. Gould L. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1989; 45: 29-64PubMed Google Scholar), a substantial fraction of intracellular vigilin may be bound to the relatively high affinity binding site in the vitellogenin mRNA 3′-UTR. Our findings are also in agreement with the ubiquitous distribution of vigilin, since we have found vigilin in allXenopus tissues we have examined and in several cell lines (18Dodson R.E. Acena M.R. Shapiro D.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 52: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have identified vigilin, a widely distributed protein containing 14 RNA binding domains, as the estrogen-regulated protein which binds to the 3′-UTR of vitellogenin mRNA. Our data provide the first evidence that vigilin can bind a specific mRNA and suggest a role for vigilin in mRNA metabolism.

Gal4-fusion proteins containing domains of the α1- and β1-subunits were designed for examining both intersubunit and intrasubunit protein-protein interactions. Regions of the α- and β-subunits known to be involved in α-β-subunit assembly were positive in two-hybrid assay, supporting the validity of the assays. A library of β-subunit ectodomains with C-terminal truncations was screened to find the maximal truncation retaining an interaction with the α-subunit extracellular H7H8 loop (where H7 refers to the seventh membrane span, and so on). The maximal truncation removed all the cysteines involved in disulfide bridges, leaving only 63 amino acids of the β-subunit ectodomain. Scanning alanine mutagenesis led to identification of an evolutionarily conserved sequence of four amino acids (SYGQ) in the extracellular H7H8 loop of the α-subunit that is crucial to α-β-intersubunit interactions. Oligomerization studies with single domains failed to detect self-association of either of the two large cytosolic loops (H2H3 and H4H5) within the α-subunit.

The Na,K-ATPase is an integral membrane protein that plays a central role in ionic homeostasis in animals by mediating the translocation of Na+ and K+ ions across the plasma membrane against their electrochemical gradients. The active Na,K-ATPase is a heterodimer comprised of a 100-kDa α-subunit that spans the plasma membrane 10 times, and a 40–60-kDa glycoprotein β-subunit that has a short cytoplasmic N-terminal domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a large extracellular domain. Both subunits are required for Na+ and K+ ion transport (1Horowitz B. Eakle K.A. Scheiner-Bobis G. Randolph G.R. Chen C.Y. Hitzeman R.A. Farley R.A. J. Biol.

The α-subunit contains the cation binding sites and the sites of ATP binding and phosphorylation, and it is therefore sometimes referred to as the catalytic subunit. The β-subunit is involved in the structural and functional maturation of the holoenzyme (4Geering K. Theulaz I. Verrey F. Hauptle M.T. Rossier B.C. Am. J.

Identification of domains involved in assembly of Na,K-ATPase subunits has been approached in previous studies by immune precipitation experiments that have involved co-expression of truncated β-subunits (12Renaud K.J.

Expression of Na,K/Ca-ATPase chimeric catalytic subunits together with the avian β-subunit in mammalian cells, usually in the T7 RNA polymerase-based expression system (20Fuerst T.R. Earl P.L. Moss B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), has allowed us to define a 26-amino acid segment within an extracellular loop of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit that is necessary and sufficient for assembly of the chimeras with the Na,K-ATPase β-subunit. To define further the specific amino acids involved in Na,K-ATPase subunit interactions, we have employed the yeast two-hybrid assay system (21Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4837) Google Scholar, 22Fields S. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1993; 5: 116-124Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). There is evidence that the Na,K-ATPase exists as an (α-β)2 heterotetramer in cell membranes, at least during some portion of the transport cycle (23Norby J.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1989; 17: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 24Norby J.G. Jensen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19548-19558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Mercer R.W. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 137: 139-168Google Scholar). Thus, one would expect that, in addition to sites of α-β-subunit assembly, there must be sites at which α-β-subunit heterodimers interact to form the native tetramers. Blanco et al. (26Blanco G. Koster J.C. Mercer R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8542-8546Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) demonstrated that α-β oligomers containing two different isoforms of the α-subunit could be purified by immune precipitation from detergent-solubilized rat brain membranes and that α-α dimers formed when two α-subunit isoforms were co-expressed in Sf-9 insect cells. In studies reported here, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen for intrasubunit interactions in the major cytosolic domains of the α-subunit and in the extracellular domain of the β-subunit. In the two-hybrid system assay, plasmids are constructed that encode two hybrid proteins: one consists of the DNA-binding domain of the transcription factor Gal4 fused to one test protein, X, and the other consists of the Gal4 activation domain fused to another test protein, Y. These plasmids are transformed into aSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain that contains reporter genes whose regulatory region contains Gal4 binding sites. Either hybrid protein alone must be unable to activate transcription of the reporter genes. The DNA-binding domain hybrid should not activate transcription because it does not provide the activation function, whereas the activation domain hybrid also should not activate transcription because it cannot localize to the Gal4 binding sites. Interaction of the two test proteins reconstitutes the function of the Gal4 transcription factor and results in expression of the reporter genes, which are detected by assays for the reporter gene products. For our studies, a set of plasmids encoding Gal4-fusion proteins that contained elements of the Na,K-ATPase α- and β-subunits were constructed and used in the two-hybrid system to explore intersubunit interactions and to look for intrasubunit interactions. The results of these experiments are presented in this report. All of the hybrid constructs were created using amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 1The abbreviation used is: PCR, polymerase chain reaction. The PCR reactions contained 10 ng of template pBluescript SK+ plasmid (Stratagene) containing a cDNA encoding either the chicken Na,K-ATPase α1- or β1-subunit, 100 ng of each primer (see below), 1 unit of Perkin-Elmer Taq DNA polymerase, 50 mmKCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.001% gelatin, and 0.2 mm of each of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates (Pharmacia Ultrapure), in a reaction volume of 0.1 ml, overlaid with 50 μl of mineral oil (Sigma). Amplification was performed for 30 cycles with a temperature profile of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 42 or 50 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. All of the PCR fragments were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes (BamHI, BglII, NcoI, and/orSmaI) overnight at room temperature for SmaI digests or at 37 °C for the other restriction enzymes. The digested PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, electroeluted, ligated overnight at 15 °C into both the pAS2 and pACT2 vectors for use in the yeast two-hybrid system (27Durfee T. Bercherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar), and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α competent cells (Boehringer Mannheim). Ampicillin-resistant colonies were screened for the presence of the PCR fragment by restriction analysis of their plasmids. The nucleotide sequences of candidate plasmids were determined, and the desired plasmids were used in the yeast transformations described below. DNA encoding the α-subunit cytoplasmic loop 1 (H2H3) was constructed using the PCR primers TC126 (5′-GATCCCGGGCAAGAAGCGAAGAGTTCGAAG-3′) and TC121 (5′-GATCGGATCCCTCCATGGCAATGGGAG-3′). This loop contains amino acids Gln143 to Glu280 of the chicken Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit, numbering residues beginning with N-terminal glycine of the mature protein as residue 1. The DNA encoding the α-subunit cytoplasmic loop 2 (H4H5) was constructed using the PCR primers TC128 (5′-GATCCCGGGGTAACGGTATGTCTGACACTA-3′) and TC119 (5′-GATCGGATCCCAGGTTATCAAAGATCA-3′). This loop contains amino acids Val335 to Leu765 of the chicken Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit. The DNA encoding the EC49 loop (H7H8) was constructed using the PCR primers TC130 (5′-GATCCCGGGATGGCAGAGAATGGGTTCTTG-3′) and TC120 (5′-GATCAGATCTGGCTGTATG GCAAGTGAATTC-3′). This loop contains amino acids Met866 to Ala914 of the chicken Na,K-ATPase α1- subunit. The DNA encoding the β-subunit ectodomain was constructed using the PCR primers TC150 (5′-ACGTCCCGGGGAATTTGAACCCAAGTAC-3′) and TC110 (5′-ATCGGGATCCGCTGCTTTTTATGTCAAATT-3′). This domain contains amino acids Glu63 to Ser304 of the chicken Na,K-ATPase β1-subunit, numbering from the N-terminal Ala of the mature protein. The DNA encoding the extracellular βX149 domain was constructed using PCR primers TC150 and TC191 (5′-TACGTCCCGGGATCCTGGACAGGGATGAGATAGGGGTTG-3′). This domain is a 93-amino acid C-terminal truncation of the β1 extracellular domain and contains amino acids Glu63 to Val211 of the chicken Na,K-ATPase β1-subunit. The DNA encoding the extracellular βX96 domain was constructed using PCR primers TC150 and TC190 (5′-TACGTCCCGGGATCCCAGTTCTCCAGCCACTCACGTTTG-3′). This domain is a 146-amino acid C-terminal truncation of the β1 extracellular domain containing amino acids Glu63 to Asn158 of the chicken Na,K-ATPase β1-subunit. For alanine scanning mutagenesis, both strands of DNA were synthesized and hybridized together to form double-stranded DNA fragments for cloning into the pAS2 and pACT2 vectors. The DNA encoding the EC49 Ala1 domain was constructed by creating two unique restriction sites within the encoding DNA and replacing the intervening region with hybridized oligonucleotides TC1C1F (5′-GTGGGATGACCGATGGATTAATGCAGCGGCCGCTAGCTATGGACAGCATGGACCTTCGAACAGAGGAAAATTGTGG-3′) and TC1C1R (5′-AATTCCACATTTTCCTCTGTTCGAAGGTCCATTGCTGTCCATAGCTAGCGGCCGCTGCATTAATCCATCGGTCATCCCACTGCA-3′). The resultant DNA encoded amino acids Met866 to Ala914 of the chicken Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit with amino acid sequence DVED converted to AAAA. The DNA encoding the EC49 Ala2 domain was constructed in an analogous fashion but using hybridized oligonucleotides TC1DF (5′-GTGGGATGACCGATGGATTAATGATGTTGAAGACGCAGCGGCCGCTCAATGGACCTTCGAACAGAGGAAAATTGTGG-3′) and TC1DR (5′-AATTCCACAATTTTCCTCTGTTCGAAGGTCCATTGAGCGGCCGCTGCGTCTTCAACATCATTAATCCATCGGTCATCCCACTGCA-3′). The resultant DNA encoded amino acids Met866 to Ala914 of the chicken Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit with SYGQ converted to AAAA. The DNA encoding the EC49 Ala3 domain was constructed using hybridized oligonucleotides TC1EF (5′-GTGGGATGACCGATGGATTAATGATGTTGAAGACAGCTATGGACAGGCAGCGGCCGCTGAACAGAGGAAAATTGTGG-3′) and TC1ER (5′-AATTCCACAATTTTCCTCTGTTAGCGGCCGCTGCCTGTCCATAGCTGTCTTCAACATCATTAATCCATCGGTCATCCCACTGCA-3′). This encodes amino acids Met866 to Ala914of the chicken Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit with QWTF converted to AAAA. The DNA encoding the EC49 Ala4 domain was constructed using hybridized oligonucleotides TC1FF (5′-GTGGGATGACCGATGGATTAATGATGTTGAAGACAGCTATGGACAGCAATGGACCTTCGCAGCGGCCGCTATTGTGG-3′) and TC1FR (5′-AATTCCACAATAGCGGCCGCTGCGAGGGTCCATTGCTGTCCATAGCTGTCTTCAACATCATTAATCCATCGGTCATCCCACTGCA-3′). This encodes amino acids Met866 to Ala914of the chicken Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit with EQRK converted to AAAA. The S. cerevisiaestrains SFY526 (MATa, ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, lys 2-801, trp 1-901, leu 2-3, 112, canr, gal4-542, gal80-538, URA3::Gal1-lacZ) and HF7c (MATa, ura3-52, his3-200, lys 2-801, ade2-101, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, gal4-542, gal80-538, LYS2::GAL1-HIS3, URA3::(GAL4 17-mers)3-CYC1-lacZ) (CLONTECHMatchmaker™) were used for all assays. Yeast cultures were grown at 30 °C in either YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) or SD minimal medium (0.5% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, and 1% desired amino acid dropout solution). Fusion genes were introduced into a yeast reporter strain by the lithium acetate transformation procedure of Gietz et al. (28Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar). Transformants were allowed to grow at 30 °C, usually for 2–4 days, until colonies were large enough to assay for β-galactosidase activity. Transformant cells were then plated directly onto sterile Whatman number 1 filters that had been layered onto selective growth media. After colonies had grown, the filters were assayed for β-galactosidase activity. The cells were permeabilized by a cycle of freezing the filters in liquid nitrogen and thawing to room temperature. Each filter is then soaked with 2 ml of Z-buffer (CLONTECHMatchmaker™ protocol manual) containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside. The filters were then placed in a covered plastic container at room temperature and checked periodically for the appearance of blue colonies. Blue colonies appeared between 30 min and 12 h. The filters were then dried and photographed to record the data. Truncations of the DNA encoding the extracellular domain of the Na,K-ATPase β-subunit were performed on the pACTβ plasmid. Exonuclease III digests were performed for 12 min during which samples were removed and the reactions quenched every 2 min. Plasmid DNA was digested with two restriction enzymes, cleaving the DNA just 3′ of the β-subunit coding DNA and leaving a protective 3′ overhang at the termination sequence and a 5′ overhang in the direction of the β-subunit coding sequence. The 3′ overhang is resistant to exonuclease III digestion. The cut DNA, 5 μg, was dissolved in 50 μl of reaction buffer (New England Biolabs) (66 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.66 mm MgCl2), 100 units of exonuclease III enzyme (New England Biolabs) were added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C. The exonuclease III digestion rate under these conditions is approximately 300 bases per min. At 2-min intervals, 5 μl of aliquots were removed, mixed with STOP solution (0.2 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min to inactivate the exonuclease III enzyme. The digested DNA was then ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 20 μl of mung bean nuclease buffer (New England Biolabs) (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm ZnSO4). Ten units of mung bean nuclease (New England Biolabs) were added, and the samples were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min to digest the single-stranded DNA and create blunt ends for ligation. The DNA was again precipitated in ethanol and resuspended in 20 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer, and blunt-end ligations were performed overnight at 16 °C to generate small libraries of pACTβ truncations. Yeast cells were co-transformed with aliquots of these pACTβ truncations and pAS αEC49. Previous immunoprecipitation studies using chimeric Ca-ATPase/Na,K-ATPase α-subunits and chimeric DPPIV/Na,K-ATPase β-subunits have demonstrated that a stretch of 26 amino acids (called EC26) (15Lemas M.V. Hamrick M. Takeyasu K. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8255-8259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), within the H7H8 extracellular loop of the α-subunit, and the ectodomain of the β-subunit (13Hamrick M. Renaud K.J. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24367-24373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are required for α-β-subunit assembly. In the present study, initial two-hybrid experiments with Gal4-fusion proteins containing the entire H7H8 extracellular loop (called EC49) of the α-subunit and the extracellular domain of the β-subunit showed that these fusion proteins form protein-protein interactions resulting in activation of transcription of the β-galactosidase reporter gene. Fig. 1 is a diagram of the Na,K-ATPase, indicating the regions of the α- and β-subunits that were analyzed in two-hybrid assays. Table I shows the results indicating that neither pAS αEC49 nor pACTβ alone activates transcription. Table II shows that when both the pAS αEC49 and pACTβ are co-expressed, β-galactosidase transcription is activated. These results demonstrate that these α and β peptides as fusion proteins in yeast retain their ability to assemble and therefore are compatible for use in the two-hybrid system.Table ITwo-hybrid constructs tested individuallyConstructβ-Galactosidase activityDNA-binding domain fusionspAS β+pAS βX149−pAS βX96−pAS cytoplasmic α-loop 1−pAS cytoplasmic α-loop 2−pAS αEC49−pAS αEC49 Ala 1−pAS αEC49 Ala 2−pAS αEC49 Ala 3−pAS αEC49 Ala 4−Activation domain fusionspACT β−pACT βX149−pACT βX96−pACT cytoplasmic α-loop 1−pACT cytoplasmic α-loop 2−pACT αEC49−pACT αEC49 Ala 1−pACT αEC49 Ala 2−pACT αEC49 Ala 3−pACT αEC49 Ala 4− Open table in a new tab Table IITwo-hybrid tests for α-β interactionsConstructβ-Galactosidase activityDNA-binding domainActivation domainpAS αEC49pACT β+pAS αEC49pACT βX149+pAS αEC49pACT βX96+pAS βpACT αEC49+pAS βX149pACT αEC49+pAS βX96pACT αEC49+ Open table in a new tab Hamrick et al. (13Hamrick M. Renaud K.J. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24367-24373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the avian Na,K-ATPase β-subunit, truncated by 92 or 146 residues from the C terminus, remained competent to form α·β complexes when expressed in mammalian cells. As an extension of these experiments, we constructed GAL4-fusion proteins containing deletions in the extracellular β domain that were the same as those of Hamricket al. (13Hamrick M. Renaud K.J. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24367-24373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that is deletions of 92 and 146 amino acids from the C terminus. These β deletions were named βX149 and βX96 because they retain 149 and 96 aminoacyl residues of the β-subunit ectodomain, respectively (see Fig. 2). These deletion constructs co-expressed with the αEC49 (H7H8) fusion protein yielded positive results in the two-hybrid assay (Table II), suggesting that the N-terminal 96 amino acids of the extracellular domain of the β-subunit (Glu63-Asn158) are sufficient to form a protein-protein interface with the EC49 extracellular loop (H7H8) of the α-subunit. To determine the minimal C-terminal extent of the β-subunit involved in protein-protein interactions with the αEC49 (H7H8) α-domain, we performed a series of exonuclease III digests on the pACTβ construct from the 3′ end. The pools of pACTβ deletions were transformed into yeast together with the pAS αEC49 (H7H8) construct. The co-transformants were plated onto media lacking histidine. If the co-expressed fusion proteins interacted, they would cause transcription of a histidine reporter gene, allowing those co-transformants to grow on histidine-deficient medium. Two separate experiments were performed, resulting in a total of 25 transformant colonies after 12 min of exonuclease III digestion. The DNA from each of these 25 colonies was isolated and used as a template in PCR reactions primed by the primers for the βX96 construct (TC150 and TC190). This PCR screen was used to look for any deletion that encoded less than the 96 amino acids of the extracellular β domain already identified. The results of this screening indicated that three of the β deletions contained fewer than 96 amino acids of the extracellular β domain. Then, a set of nested oligonucleotide primers was used to estimate the extent of coding region remaining in the three β deletion clones. From this experiment, it appeared that the shortest β truncation encoded no more than 63 amino acids and possibly as few as 61. Finally, to test this conclusion, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the pACTβX96 plasmid, introducing a stop codon after the codon for Asp125 of the β-subunit ectodomain. This construct, pACTβX63, co-expressed with pAS αEC49, yielded positive results in the yeast two-hybrid system, confirming that Glu63 to Asp125 is a sufficient extent of the extracellular β-subunit domain for interaction with the α-subunit EC49 loop (H7H8). These results suggest that the three disulfide loops of the β-subunit are not required for interaction with αEC49 (H7H8) and that no more than the 63 amino acids adjacent to the transmembrane domain are necessary for this interaction. This region isshaded in the diagram of the β-subunit in Fig. 2. To identify individual amino acids involved in the α-β intersubunit interaction, we constructed Gal4-fusions with altered forms of the EC49 α-subunit domain (H7H8) that contained amino acid mutations to alanine. We chose to use the EC49 context since the EC26 fusion protein activated transcription on its own (Table I). Sequence alignments of the aminoacyl resides in the EC49 (H7H8) domain of the α-subunit revealed a cluster of residues well-conserved among all the known α-subunits of the Na,K-ATPase and H, K-ATPase families (the families in which α-β heterodimers appear to be the functional units) (Fig.3). To identify aminoacyl residues within the H7H8 loop that might be involved in α-β-subunit interactions, a set of four alanine scanning variants of the EC49 region were constructed (see Fig.3), and these constructs were co-expressed with the Gal4-β-subunit constructs pACTβ, pACTβX149, and pACTβX96 in yeast two-hybrid assays. Table III shows the results of the two-hybrid assays. The fusion proteins EC49 Ala1, EC49 Ala3, and EC49 Ala4 all demonstrate positive protein-protein interactions with all three β fusion proteins. These results suggest that the 12 mutated aminoacyl residues may not be crucial to protein-protein interactions between the α- and β-subunits. However, the fusion protein EC49 Ala2 did not show positive protein-protein interactions with any of the three Gal4-β-subunit fusion proteins. These results suggest that the group of four highly conserved amino acids (SYGQ) is directly involved in protein-protein interactions between the α- and β-subunits.Table IIITwo-hybrid assays on alanine-scanning mutants of the α-subunit H7H8 loopConstructβ-Galactosidase activityDNA-binding domainActivation domainpAS αEC49pACT β+pAS αEC49 Ala 1pACT β+pAS αEC49 Ala 2pACT β−pAS αEC49 Ala 3pACT β+pAS αEC49 Ala 4pACT β+pAS αEC49pACT βX149+pAS αEC49 Ala 1pACT βX149+pAS αEC49 Ala 2pACT βX149−pAS αEC49 Ala 3pACT βX149+pAS αEC49 Ala 4pACT βX149+pAS αEC49pACT βX96+pAS αEC49 Ala 1pACT βX96+pAS αEC49 Ala 2pACT βX96−pAS αEC49 Ala 3pACT βX96+pAS αEC49 Ala 4pACT βX96+pAS βX149pACT αEC49+pAS βX149pACT αEC49 Ala1+pAS βX149pACT αEC49 Ala2−pAS βX149pACT αEC49 Ala3+pAS βX149pACT αEC49 Ala4+pAS βX96pACT αEC49+pAS βX96pACT αEC49 Ala1+pAS βX96pACT αEC49 Ala2−pAS βX96pACT αEC49 Ala3+pAS βX96pACT αEC49 Ala4+ Open table in a new tab There is substantial evidence that the Na,K-ATPase exists largely as (α-β)2 dimers in cell membranes. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to seek elements of the α-subunit that might be involved in α-α interactions; similarly, we sought evidence for β-β interactions. The two largest individual cytosolic domains of the α-subunit (see Fig. 1) were tested for self-association: α cytoplasmic loop 1 (H2H3) with itself, and α cytoplasmic loop 2 (H4H5) with itself. The results in TableIV demonstrate that in two-hybrid assays no α-α self-associations occurred. Likewise, tests for oligomerization involving the ectodomain of the β-subunit were mostly negative (TableIV). Only the βX96 fusion protein demonstrated any oligomerization interactions with itself. These results are inconclusive as to whether biologically significant β-β-subunit interactions occur. The lack of positive results with the larger ectodomain suggests that β-β interactions are not biologically meaningful. The full-length β-subunit ectodomain could not be tested for β-β interactions because the β-subunit ectodomain fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain was positive when expressed in yeast by itself.Table IVTwo-hybrid assays for α-α and β-β interactionsConstructsβ-Galactosidase activityDNA-binding domainActivation domainpAS cytoplasmic α-loop 1pACT cytoplasmic α-loop 1−pAS cytoplasmic α-loop 2pACT cytoplasmic α-loop 2−pASβpACTβ−pASβx149pACTβx149−pASβx96pACTβx96+pAS cytoplasmic α-loop 1pACT cytoplasmic α-loop 2−pAS cytoplasmic α-loop 2pACT cytoplasmic α-loop 1+ Open table in a new tab The two large cytoplasmic loops of the α-subunit were also tested for interaction with each other in the yeast two-hybrid system. The α cytoplasmic loop 1 (H2H3) and α cytoplasmic loop 2 (H4H5) were positive for interaction when α cytoplasmic loop 1 (H2H3) was fused to the activation domain and α cytoplasmic loop 2 (H4H5) was fused to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 but not when in the reverse orientation (Table IV). These results do support the occurrence of interactions between the H2H3 and the H4H5 loops of the α-subunit but are less compelling than would be the case if positive results had been obtained with the loops in both fusion configurations. While the major application of the two-hybrid system has been for screening cDNA libraries to find clones encoding proteins that bind some target protein, the same methodology is useful for identifying domains or amino acids involved in interactions between proteins that are known to interact. Many combinations of proteins have been used successfully in the two-hybrid assay. These combinations include many nuclear, cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, and viral proteins but only a few membrane-associated proteins (22Fields S. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1993; 5: 116-124Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this study is the first to utilize the two-hybrid system to define domains of subunit interaction in a multi-subunit plasma membrane protein. It is important to note some caveats about the studies reported here. First, α- and β-subunit interactions that are essential to the processes involved in assembly of the Na,K-ATPase in the endoplasmic reticulum need not be entirely the same as sites of subunit interaction in the mature, active enzyme.

Secretion of VLDL containing hB48 (hB48-VLDL) by the transfected cells was induced by exogenous oleate (0.4 mm), and oleate-dependent VLDL secretion was selectively inhibited by brefeldin A (0.2 μg/ml). Two protocols were used to determine the effect of MTP inhibition on VLDL secretion. In the first protocol, cell protein and lipid were labeled with radioactive amino acids and oleate prior to MTP inhibition (using 5 μm of the photoaffinity inhibitor BMS-192951 to reduce MTP activity by 65–70%), and secretion of prelabeled apoB and triacylglycerol (TG) associated with lipoproteins was monitored during oleate-supplemented chase. In control cells, a 6-fold increase in incorporation of prelabeled TG into hB48-VLDL was observed after oleate supplement, while incorporation of prelabeled TG into VLDL containing endogenous rat apoB100 (rB100-VLDL) was unaffected. Inhibition of MTP activity abolished the oleate-induced utilization of prelabeled TG (by 80%) and hB48 (by 70%) for hB48-VLDL secretion but decreased utilization of pre-existing TG (by <25%) and B100 (by 45%) for rB100-VLDL secretion to a lesser extent. Inhibition of MTP did not affect incorporation of prelabeled TG or hB48 into high density lipoproteins containing hB48 (hB48-HDL). In the second protocol, MTP was inactivated prior to metabolic labeling of protein and lipid, and secretion of newly labeled apoB and TG as lipoproteins was monitored after oleate supplement. Under this condition, MTP inhibition decreased incorporation of newly labeled TG (by 80%) and hB48 (80%) into hB48-VLDL but did not affect their incorporation into hB48-HDL. Additionally, MTP inhibition decreased incorporation of newly labeled TG (by 50%) and rB100 (by 90%) into rB100-VLDL. Thus, normal activity of MTP is required for the oleate-induced secretion of hB48-VLDL from McA-RH7777 cells.

In the first stage, apoB48 is associated with a small amount of lipid to form a primordial particle with high buoyant density. These high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles (designated B48-HDL) may be secreted from the cells if further lipid recruitment does not occur. Alternatively, the B48-HDL particle can undergo a second lipidation stage, expanding its lipid content, primarily triacylglycerol (TG), to form VLDL. This “two-step” assembly model is consistent with the early immunohistochemical studies of hepatic VLDL assembly in rats (8Alexander C.A. Hamilton R.L. Havel R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 69: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).

These results suggest that in addition to active TG synthesis, other factors involved in vesicular trafficking or lipid mobilization may participate in the second stage of B48-VLDL formation. The microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is a heterodimeric protein consisting of a 97-kDa catalytic subunit noncovalently linked to protein-disulfide isomerase (10Gordon D.A. Wetterau J. Gregg R.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The ability of MTP to transfer TG between lipid membranes has been demonstrated in vitro (11Jamil H. Dickson Jr., J.K. Chu C.-H. Lago M.W. Rinehart J.K. Biller S.A. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J.R. J. Biol.

It is unclear, however, whether the direct interaction between MTP and apoB is essential for the recruitment of lipid. The functional role of MTP in the secretion of lipoproteins containing apoB has been demonstrated by co-expression of MTP and apoB in heterologous cells that normally produce neither protein (15Gordon D.A.

Data from these reconstitution experiments clearly indicate that MTP indeed plays an important role in the assembly and secretion of lipoproteins containing apoB. However, since cell lines used for the reconstitution experiments lacked the ability to synthesize and secrete VLDL, the requirement for MTP activity in VLDL assembly, particularly in the second step assembly, could not be determined. Thus, an alternative approach to assess the involvement of MTP in VLDL synthesis is to use inhibitors that can specifically inactivate MTP in situ. Inactivation of MTP using specific MTP inhibitors has recently been reported by several laboratories to inhibit apoB secretion from cells of hepatic or intestinal origin (19Gordon D.A. Jamil H.

Invariably, the inhibition of MTP activity markedly decreased secretion of the full-length apoB100. However, the effect of MTP inhibition on apoB48 secretion was less consistent. In Caco-2 cells, while MTP inhibition resulted in significantly decreased secretion of apoB100, secretion of apoB48 was unaffected (22Haghpassand M. Wilder D. Moberly J.B. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1468-1480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In McA-RH7777 cells, inactivation of MTP seemed to only affect formation of B48-HDL (i.e. the product of the first step assembly) but had no effect on the conversion of B48-HDL into B48-VLDL (19Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Gregg R.E. Olofsson S.-O. Borén J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33047-33053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The differential effect of MTP inhibition on apoB48 secretion in different cells has not been explained. Several laboratories including ours (23Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. Linton M.F. Taylor S.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 2852-2862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have presented experimental evidence that the size of lipoproteins is positively correlated with the length of the associated apoB polypeptide during the first step assembly. However, the length of apoB does not seem to play a major role in the conversion of apoB-HDL into apoB-VLDL during the second step assembly. In McA-RH7777 cells stably expressing recombinant human apoB variants or apoAI/B chimeric proteins, HDL that carried either truncated apoB variants (e.g. as short as apoB34) or apoAI/B chimeras containing a segment of apoB (e.g. as short as ∼5% of apoB100) were readily converted into VLDL in the presence of exogenous oleate (27McLeod R.S. Wang Y. Wang S. Rusiñol A. Links P. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18445-18455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, conversion of apoB-HDL into apoB-VLDL in the second step may be determined primarily by synthesis of lipid and by protein factors that mobilize the lipid during assembly rather than specific apoB sequences. Since MTP plays an important role in lipid transfer, we hypothesize that the MTP activity is required for the mobilization of lipid that is utilized for the oleate-induced B48-VLDL assembly. This hypothesis was tested in the current work. Culture media and sera were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Reagents for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were obtained from Bio-Rad. Sheep anti-human apoB antiserum was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. [9,10-3H]Oleate (9.2 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Du Pont. [2-3H]Glycerol (9.6 Ci/mmol) was obtained from ICN Pharmaceuticals Canada Ltd.

Oleic acid, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and standard lipids were obtained from Sigma. Silica gel 60 thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates and organic solvents used for TLC were obtained from BDH chemicals. Brefeldin A was obtained from Epicenter Technologies. The photoactive MTP inhibitor BMS-192951 was a gift of D. Gordon (Bristol-Myers Squibb). Antibody (1D1) specific for human apoB was obtained from R. Milne and Y. Marcel (University of Ottawa Heart Institute). McA-RH7777 cells stably transfected with the human apoB48 (hB48) cDNA were generated and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) plus 20% serum as described previously (28Hussain M.M. Zhao Y. Kancha R.K. Blackhart B.D. Yao Z. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Inhibition of MTP in McA-RH7777 cells with the compound BMS-192951 was conducted according to an established protocol (19Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Gregg R.E. Olofsson S.-O. Borén J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33047-33053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The hB48-transfected cells (60-mm dish) were incubated with 400 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine in 2 ml of DMEM (20% serum) ± 0.4 mm oleate for up to 4 h. The conditioned media were collected, diluted to 5 ml with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and subjected to sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (7Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twelve fractions (1 ml each) were collected from the top of the centrifuge tubes. The 35S-labeled apoB proteins were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography as described previously (27McLeod R.S. Wang Y. Wang S. Rusiñol A. Links P. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18445-18455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cells were pulse-labeled with 10 μCi of [14C]oleate or 15 μCi of [3H]oleate for 4 h, and during the chase period (4 h) they were incubated with 30 μCi of [3H]glycerol ± 0.4 mm oleate. In some experiments, after pulse labeling a 1- or 2-h delay was introduced prior to the initiation of chase to deplete any residual intracellular [3H]oleate pool, and inactivation of MTP with BMS-192951 was performed during the 1-h delay period. VLDL and HDL were separated by ultracentrifugation, and lipoproteins containing rat B100 (rB100-VLDL, d < 1.02 g/ml) or hB48 (hB48-VLDL, d < 1.02 g/ml or hB48-HDL,d = 1.08–1.13 g/ml) were separated by immunoaffinity chromatography. Lipids associated with these particles were extracted with chloroform/methanol. Separation of phospholipids and neutral lipids was performed on silica gel 60 plates as described (29Selby S.L. Yao Z. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1900-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) using egg yolk lipids as a carrier. Cell lipids were also extracted and separated by TLC. The radioactivity associated with individual lipid species was quantified by liquid scintillation counting (Wallac 1409 counter). Monoclonal antibody 1D1 (4 mg) was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads (1 g) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twelve fractions obtained from sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of the conditioned [35S]methionine labeling media were mixed with bovine serum albumin (final concentration 1%) and 100 μl of 1D1-affinity beads for 16 h at 4 °C to recover hB48-lipoprotein. After hB48-lipoprotein was precipitated, the supernatant was subsequently mixed with an anti-B antiserum to recover lipoproteins containing endogenous rat apoB100. Immunocomplexes with either hB48- or rB100-lipoproteins were washed five times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation. Since these lipoproteins were mostly confined to density fractions 1 and 2 (VLDL,d < 1.02 g/ml) and 8–10 (HDL, d = 1.08–1.13 g/ml), only three combined fractions (i.e.hB48-VLDL, rB100-VLDL, and hB48-HDL) were subjected to lipid analysis. The recovery of hB48-VLDL from the conditioned medium by immunoaffinity purification was greater than 90%, and the purified hB48-VLDL contained less than 15% endogenous rB100-VLDL as determined by Western blot analysis and by quantification of 35S-labeled apoBs (data not shown). In McA-RH7777 cells transfected with recombinant hB48, the secretion of hB48-VLDL is dependent upon oleate supplementation (27McLeod R.S. Wang Y. Wang S. Rusiñol A. Links P. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18445-18455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This event is similar to the oleate-induced secretion of VLDL containing rat B48 (rB48) in nontransfected McA-RH7777 cells (7Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As reported previously, overexpression of hB48 suppressed endogenous rB48 secretion (28Hussain M.M. Zhao Y. Kancha R.K. Blackhart B.D. Yao Z. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To demonstrate further that hB48-VLDL secretion was comparable with endogenous rB48-VLDL secretion, we tested the response of the transfected cell line to brefeldin A. It has been reported that the oleate-induced rB48-VLDL assembly (the second step) was sensitive to low doses of brefeldin A (9Rustaeus S. Lindberg K. Borén J. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28879-28886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We found that in hB48-transfected McA-RH7777 cells, secretion of hB48-VLDL was also sensitive to brefeldin A. Fig. 1 A shows fluorograms of 35S-labeled apoBs that were secreted as lipoproteins from the cells treated with (bottom) or without (top) 0.2 μg/ml brefeldin A, and Fig. 1 B shows the quantitative assessment of apolipoprotein secretion. In the absence of brefeldin A, hB48 was secreted as both VLDL and HDL (Fig.1 A, top). In the presence of brefeldin A, secretion of hB48-VLDL was decreased by 60% compared with control, whereas secretion of hB48-HDL was not decreased (Fig. 1 A,bottom). As expected, endogenous rB100-VLDL secretion was also decreased by 60% by the brefeldin A treatment (Fig.1 A, bottom). In these experiments, the amount of radioactivity associated with intracellular 35S-labeled rB100 was 40–50% lower in the brefeldin A-treated cells than control (during a 2-h labeling period), but the radioactivity associated with intracellular 35S-labeled hB48 was unchanged (data not shown). Synthesis of TG and phosphatidylcholine (PC) was not affected by brefeldin A treatment, as measured by the incorporation of [3H]glycerol during a 4-h labeling period (data not shown). These results together indicate that mechanisms responsible for the second step hB48-VLDL assembly and secretion are preserved in the transfected McA-RH7777 cells. Thus, in the subsequent experiments the hB48-transfected cells were used to examine the requirement of MTP activity for the oleate-induced B48-VLDL secretion. To monitor lipid incorporation into secreted B48-VLDL, we first labeled the intracellular lipid pool with [14C]oleate under basal conditions (i.e. DMEM plus 20% serum). During this labeling period, additional oleate mass was not present; therefore, the cells did not produce B48-VLDL. After [14C]oleate labeling, the cells were washed and immediately incubated with DMEM (20% serum) containing 0.4 mm oleate to induce the second step. Oleate was not present in the medium of control cells. In addition, [3H]glycerol was included in both chase media to label newly synthesized lipid. Fig.2 A shows that incorporation of [3H]glycerol-labeled TG (newly synthesized) into secreted rB100-VLDL, hB48-VLDL, or hB48-HDL was increased by 4-, 16-, and 2-fold, respectively, by exogenous oleate. Similarly, incorporation of [3H]glycerol-labeled PC into secreted rB100-VLDL and hB48-VLDL (but not hB48-HDL) was increased by the oleate treatment (Fig. 2 A). These results suggest that upon oleate supplementation, newly synthesized TG is utilized for both hB48-VLDL and rB100-VLDL secretion. However, a striking difference was observed between incorporation of prelabeled [14C]TG into secreted hB48-VLDL or rB100-VLDL. While oleate treatment had no apparent stimulatory effect on incorporation of [14C]TG into rB100-VLDL, it increased incorporation of [14C]TG into hB48-VLDL more than 6-fold (Fig. 2 B). Measurement of [14C]TG associated with hB48-VLDL could be an underestimate of secretion of prelabeled TG, since supplementation of the medium with oleate stimulated TG synthesis and inevitably decreased the specific activity of the [14C]TG pool. There was a concomitant 2-fold decrease in the incorporation of [14C]TG into hB48-HDL at the end of a 4-h chase (Fig. 2 B). The effect of oleate on the incorporation of prelabeled [14C]PC into the secreted lipoproteins, however, was similar to that for newly synthesized [3H]PC. These results demonstrate that the unique feature associated with the oleate-stimulated hB48-VLDL secretion is the utilization of pre-existing TG. In the following experiments, we used incorporation of pre-existing TG into hB48-VLDL as a marker to assess the requirement of MTP activity in the second step assembly. A photoactivated MTP inhibitor, designated BMS-192951 (19Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Gregg R.E. Olofsson S.-O. Borén J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33047-33053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), was used to inactivate MTP in hB48-transfected McA-RH7777 cells. After incubation with cells for 1 h and subsequent photoactivation (under ultraviolet light for 15 min), BMS-192951 at 5 or 10 μm reduced the MTP activity by 65–70%. The inhibitory effect persisted for at least 8 h (data not shown). The effect of MTP inhibition on the recruitment of prelabeled TG during oleate-induced second step was determined by pulse labeling of the cells with [3H]oleate (4 h), inactivating MTP with BMS-192951 (1¼ h), and monitoring lipoprotein secretion during oleate-supplemented chase. In preliminary experiments, we found that introducing a 1- or 2-h delay period between pulse and chase (Fig.3 A) did not affect the oleate-induced secretion of pre-existing TG as hB48-VLDL. After a 1- or 2-h delay, incorporation of prelabeled TG into secreted hB48-VLDL was again increased by 5–7-fold upon oleate supplementation (Fig.3 B), while incorporation of prelabeled TG into rB100-VLDL was unchanged (Fig. 3 C). Increased TG synthesis during oleate-supplemented chase did not significantly alter the intracellular pool of the prelabeled TG or PC, although a small increase in labeled TG and a slight decrease in labeled PC were consistently observed (Fig.3, D and E). These results indicate that the oleate-stimulated recruitment of pre-existing TG for hB48-VLDL secretion is not diminished after a 1- or 2-h delay. However, recruitment of pre-existing TG for hB48-VLDL secretion was abolished by MTP inhibition (Fig. 4). At 5 μm BMS-192951, incorporation of 35S-labeled rB100 and hB48 into secreted VLDL decreased by 45 and 70%, respectively, as compared with cells treated with no inhibitor (Fig. 4,A and B). MTP inhibition had little effect on secretion of 35S-labeled hB48 with HDL. Inactivation of MTP also decreased the incorporation of lipid into VLDL. Secretion of prelabeled [3H]TG and [3H]PC associated with hB48-VLDL was decreased by 80 and 85%, respectively, at the end of a 4-h chase (Fig. 4 C). Inhibition of MTP did not affect secretion of [3H]TG associated with hB48-HDL or [3H]PC with rB100-VLDL, and it only slightly (<25%) decreased the secretion of [3H]TG with rB100-VLDL or [3H]PC with hB48-HDL (Fig. 4 C). These results provide evidence that utilization of pre-existing TG for the oleate-induced hB48-VLDL secretion is sensitive to MTP inhibition. The relatively small effect on secretion of pre-existing TG as rB100-VLDL suggests that a considerable amount of rB100-VLDL particles are probably formed before the oleate-induced second step. The turnover of prelabeled [3H]TG and [3H]PC in MTP-inactivated cells during oleate-supplemented chase was identical to that in untreated cells (see Fig. 3, D and E), indicating that MTP inactivation did not alter the pools of prelabeled lipid. Nor did MTP inhibition affect secretion of endogenous rat apoAI as HDL (data not shown). We then examined the effect of MTP inhibition on VLDL secretion by inactivating MTP prior to metabolic labeling of apoB and lipid. Inactivation of MTP diminished the secretion of 35S-labeled apoB proteins associated with hB48-VLDL (by 80%) or rB100-VLDL (by 90%) as compared with cells treated without inhibitor (Fig.5, A and B). Similarly, MTP inhibition decreased secretion of [3H]TG associated with hB48-VLDL (by 6-fold) or rB100-VLDL (by less than 2-fold) (Fig.5 C). The greater decrease in radiolabeled rB100 than in radiolabeled TG in the rB100-VLDL fraction indicates that the trace amount of secreted rB100-VLDL is enriched with newly labeled TG. However, similar to our observations in pulse-chase experiments (Fig.4), secretion of 35S-labeled B48 or [3H]TG associated with hB48-HDL was unaffected by MTP inhibition (Fig. 5,B and C). These results are reminiscent of the inhibitory effect of brefeldin A on hB48-VLDL secretion (Fig. 1) and demonstrate further that MTP activity is required for the oleate-induced secretion of hB48-VLDL. Under these experimental conditions, incorporation of [3H]glycerol into cellular TG was decreased by 30% (69.8 ± 9.8% of control,n = 8) during a 4-h labeling period in the inhibitor-treated cells compared with untreated cells, whereas incorporation of [3H]glycerol into PC was not affected (103.0 ± 14.5% of control, n = 8). In the current work we have inquired whether or not MTP activity is required for B48-VLDL secretion using two experimental protocols: MTP was inactivated either before or after metabolic labeling to assess secretion of pre-existing or newly synthesized apoB and lipid as lipoproteins. We took advantage of the fact that hB48-VLDL could be readily purified from the culture media of hB48-transfected McA-RH7777 cells, which retained the ability to secrete hB48-VLDL upon oleate supplementation. We also took advantage of the fact that pre-existing TG was preferentially utilized for hB48-VLDL secretion, which could be used to monitor the oleate-induced second step. In the present study, we found that under conditions where MTP activity was reduced by 65–70%, secretion of either newly synthesized (Fig. 5) or prelabeled hB48 and TG (Fig. 4) as hB48-VLDL was abolished, whereas their secretion as hB48-HDL was unaffected. Most strikingly, secretion of pre-existing TG as hB48-VLDL that was specifically enhanced during the oleate-induced second step (Figs. 2 and 3) was extremely sensitive to MTP inhibition (Fig. 4). These results suggest strongly that expanding the neutral lipid core during hB48-VLDL assembly could be achieved only with normal MTP activity. Recently, we found that secretion of VLDL containing other truncated apoB variants (e.g. B37) or apoAI/B chimeric proteins (e.g. AI/B29–34) was also induced by oleate supplementation (27McLeod R.S. Wang Y. Wang S. Rusiñol A. Links P. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18445-18455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Moreover, secretion of VLDL containing B37 or AI/B29–34 by the transfected McA-RH7777 cells upon oleate supplementation was also abolished by MTP inhibition. 2R. S. McLeod and Z. Yao, unpublished results. These results provide additional evidence indicating that the oleate-induced VLDL secretion is not solely determined by apoB length and that MTP is an important component of the second step VLDL assembly and secretion. There are two important differences between hB48-VLDL and rB100-VLDL secretion in the lipid recruitment and its sensitivity to MTP inhibition. The first difference was in the kinetics of incorporation of pre-existing TG upon oleate supplementation. Although both newly synthesized and pre-existing TG could be utilized for rB100-VLDL and hB48-VLDL secretion, pre-existing TG seemed to be preferentially incorporated into hB48-VLDL upon oleate-induced VLDL secretion. Thus, while there was a 6-fold increase in the incorporation of pre-existing TG into hB48-VLDL, there was no difference in secretion of pre-existing TG as rB100-VLDL upon oleate supplementation (Figs. 2 and 3). These results indicate clearly that assembly and secretion of B48-VLDL and B100-VLDL must be achieved through different pathways. The second difference was observed in the response of pre-existing TG recruitment to MTP inhibition. Although inactivation of MTP (by ∼70%) decreased secretion of both newly synthesized and pre-existing TG as B48-VLDL and B100-VLDL, the most remarkable effect of MTP inhibition was to abolish the incorporation of pre-existing TG into B48-VLDL during oleate-induced second step. Thus, while secretion of pre-existing TG as hB48-VLDL was decreased by 80%, incorporation of pre-existing TG into rB100-VLDL was only slightly affected (<25%) by MTP inhibition (Fig.4). The oleate-stimulated incorporation of pre-existing TG into hB48-VLDL and its extreme sensitivity to MTP inhibition provide evidence to support the assembly model, suggesting that bulk lipid is added to a primordial B48-HDL particle in the oleate-induced second step (4Innerarity T.L. Borén J. Yamanaka S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2353-2356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast to B48, the inability of B100 to mobilize additional pre-existing TG in response to oleate and its relative insensitivity to MTP inhibition would support the hypothesis that B100-VLDL is assembled primarily through a “one-step” process even before oleate supplementation (7Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Borén J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9858-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that post-translational lipid recruitment may not play a major role in B100-VLDL assembly. The present observation that reduced MTP activity results in decreased hB48-VLDL secretion is reminiscent of the similar inhibitory effect of brefeldin A on VLDL secretion (Fig. 1). It has been reported that B48-VLDL secretion induced by exogenous oleate in McA-RH7777 cells can be specifically inhibited by a low dose of brefeldin A (9Rustaeus S. Lindberg K. Borén J.

Since brefeldin A interferes with the formation of coatomers essential for vesicular transport (31Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar), this result suggests that vesicularization of ER or other intracellular trafficking events may also be components of the second step. Phenotypically, the inhibitory effect of a low dose of MTP inhibitor on lipoprotein secretion was similar to that of brefeldin A: suppressed secretion of hB48-VLDL (and rB100-VLDL) without affecting secretion of hB48-HDL (Figs. 1 and 5). Thus, although speculative, MTP may play a role in facilitating formation of ER-associated TG droplets at the site of the second step by mobilization of the cellular stored TG, processes that could also be sensitive to brefeldin A. Since the current study was not designed to reveal the precursor-product relationship between hB48-HDL and hB48-VLDL, the effect of MTP inactivation on this conversion was not directly examined. The relationship between brefeldin A-sensitive vesicular movement and MTP-facilitated TG mobilization during the second step VLDL assembly needs further evaluation. Although their overall effects on hB48-VLDL secretion were similar, brefeldin A and MTP inhibitor exerted different effects on the apparent synthesis of intracellular TG. While brefeldin A (0.2 μg/ml) had no effect on cell TG synthesis, inactivation of MTP by the inhibitor BMS-192951 (5 μm) consistently decreased (by 30%) the incorporation of radiolabeled tracer into cell TG (when metabolic labeling was initiated after MTP inhibition). The apparent decrease in TG synthesis could not be explained by increased turnover of the labeled TG, since the pulse-chase experiment showed that MTP inhibition had no effect on the level of the prelabeled cell TG pool, nor was the decreased TG synthesis the result of impairment of lipid synthesis in general, since incorporation of radiolabeled tracer into cell PC was not affected. Currently, there is no satisfactory explanation for the impaired TG synthesis by MTP inhibition. In the present experiments, the use of a low dose of MTP inhibitor (5 μm) preserved 30–35% of the initial cellular MTP activity. Apparently, the residual MTP activity and the retained active TG synthesis were sufficient to allow normal secretion of the products of first step assembly, such as hB48-HDL. Whether or not the decreased TG synthesis (by 30%) that was associated with MTP inactivation also contributed to the impaired second step hB48-VLDL assembly needs to be determined. Since heterozygotes for human abetalipoproteinemia are asymptomatic, the activity of the MTP expressed from the functional allele is presumably sufficient for normal lipoprotein production. Further experiments using MTP inhibitors in whole animals such as transgenic mice expressing human apoB (2Farese Jr., R.V. Véniant M.M. Cham C.M. Flynn L.M. Pierotti V. Loring J.F. Ruland S.

The current model for the mode of MTP action in hepatic B48-VLDL synthesis includes but extends beyond the proposed role that MTP plays in the early stage of lipoprotein assembly (19Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Gregg R.E. Olofsson S.-O. Borén J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33047-33053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In cultured cell lines such as COS and HeLa, cells that do not normally synthesize apoB or MTP, coexpression of recombinant MTP and truncated apoB variants resulted in enhanced secretion of most apoB variants examined (15Gordon D.A.

In these cells, the requirement of MTP expression and oleate-induced lipogenesis appeared to be a function of apoB length, suggesting that there is an important interplay between lipid availability, MTP activity, and the hydrophobic lipid-binding regions of apoB. In transfected cells that lacked MTP activity, the expressed apoBs were unable to translocate across the microsomal membrane or were degraded immediately after translocation (32Thrift R.N. Drisko J. Dueland S. Trawick J.D. Davis R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9161-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, inactivation of MTP in McA-RH7777 cells would be expected to somehow diminish apoB synthesis, either by premature termination of chain elongation or by rapid degradation of newly synthesized polypeptides (18Wang S. McLeod R.S. Gordon D.A. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14124-14133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The extent of MTP inhibition on apoB synthesis and on the secretion of the first step products (i.e. HDL- and LDL-like particles) also appeared to be a function of apoB length (33McLeod, R. S., Wang, S., Gordon, D. A., Jamil, H., and Yao, Z. (1996)Circulation , 94, Suppl. I, 150 (abstr.).Google Scholar). In Caco-2 cells treated with an MTP inhibitor, secretion of B48 was not affected, whereas secretion of B100 was abolished (22Haghpassand M. Wilder D. Moberly J.B. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1468-1480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in a murine mammary-derived cell line that lacks MTP activity, assembly and secretion of the transfected N-terminal 41% of human apoB on HDL-sized lipoproteins has been observed (34Herscovitz H. Kritis A. Talianidis I. Zany E. Zannis V. Small D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These data together reinforce the notion that the requirement of MTP activity for apoB secretion is correlated positively with the length of apoB and with the extent of lipid recruitment (18Wang S. McLeod R.S. Gordon D.A. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14124-14133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The current study, therefore, presents evidence that the activity of MTP, together with the brefeldin A-sensitive ER vesicularization and other protein factors, may constitute the complex second step of B48-VLDL assembly and subsequent B48-VLDL secretion. These events, induced by exogenous oleate in McA-RH7777 cells, may represent an enhanced mobilization of pre-existing TG for the expansion of the neutral lipid core of VLDL. In addition, the enhanced lipid mobilization may also facilitate the first step lipid assembly by apoB, a step that has been documented to be assisted by MTP. Thus, MTP activity is required for the entire VLDL assembly process, including both co-translational and post-translational addition of bulk neutral lipid. We are indebted to D. Gordon for providing assistance in designing experimental protocols during the early stage of this research and are grateful to H. Jamil (Bristol-Myers Squibb) for performing the MTP activity assay.

Young T. Hyams J.S. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 674-699Google Scholar). The recently elucidated crystallographic structure of an active fragment of cyclin A has shown that the cyclin box (of cyclin A) displays a uniquely folded structure comprising five alpha helices. This structure, cyclin fold, repeats itself in a region extending from the C terminus of the cyclin box. There is little amino acid sequence similarity between the two cyclin folds (9Brown N.R.

Although Cdk5 is present in all mammalian tissues and cell extracts examined (11Hayes T.E. Valtz N.L.M. McKay R.D.G. New Biol. 1991; 3: 259-269PubMed Google Scholar), brain is the only source where Cdk5 kinase activity has been demonstrated (12Ishiguro K. Takamatsu M. Tomizawa K. Omori A. Takahashi M. Arioka M.

The mechanism of activation of Cdk5 by Nck5a and Nck5ai appears to differ from that of Cdk activation by cyclins.

The present study was initiated to probe the structural domain of Nck5a essential for the activation of Cdk5. We find that the size of the active domain of Nck5a is essentially identical to that of cyclin A. By site-directed mutagenesis, a few residues of the protein important for Cdk5 binding and Cdk5 activation were located. The results are compatible with a previous suggestion from computer modeling that Nck5a may assume a tertiary structure similar to that of cyclin A (9Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Garman E.F.

PCR primers were designed to match a common C-terminal region and different N-terminal regions with BamHI site andEcoRI site flanking the N-terminal and the C-terminal primers, respectively. PCR was carried out in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 100 ng of double-stranded DNA template, 200 μm deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 2.5 units of Pyrococcus furiosus DNA polymerase (Stratagene) using a DNA thermal cycler (GeneAmp PCR System 2400, Perkin-Elmer) for 30 cycles. The PCR amplified fragments were gel purified with a GenecleanII kit (Bio 101, Inc. from BCH Medical Supplies Co.). After digestion withBamHI and EcoRI, the fragments were inserted intoBamHI/EcoRI linearized pGEX2T vector. C-terminal deletions of p35nck5a with Bal 31 were performed according to the published procedures (27Lees E.M. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1194-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 28Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E.

Briefly, 30 μg of pGEX2T construct containing p35nck5a insert was linearized at the 3′ end byEcoRI. The linearized DNA, after phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, was resuspended in water containing 500 μg/ml BSA. An equal volume of 2 × concentrated Bal 31 nuclease buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, 1200 mm NaCl, 24 mm CaCl2, 24 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm EDTA), prewarmed to 30 °C, together with 2 units of Bal 31 (New England Biolabs) were added. The mixture was then incubated at 30 °C for different periods of time. To obtain multiple C-terminal deletions, an aliquot of sample was withdrawn into EGTA solution (final 20 mm) at every 20-s interval up to 6 min and was heated at 65 °C for 10 min to terminate the Bal 31 reaction. Samples from three time points in every minute were pooled and treated with T4 DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), after phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, according to standard protocols (28Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E.

Three procedures were used to produce the site-directed mutations. For the mutation sites close to either the N or C terminus, mutations were incorporated into the 5′ site of the PCR primers. After PCR reaction, the amplified DNA fragments were ligated into pGEX2T vector. The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The site-directed substitution of Glu-221 with an alanine was performed using a commercial kit (QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene). Basically, a pair of complementary PCR primers with 30–40 bases was designed that placed the mutation in the middle of the primers. In this case, the up primer is 5′-GGGCTCGGATCATGcGCTCCAGGCCGTCC-3′ and the low primer is 5′-GGACGGCCTGGAGCgCGTGATCCGAGCCC-3′. Parental cDNA inserted in pGEX2T was amplified using Pyrococcus furiosus DNA polymerase with these primers for 15 cycles in a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer). After digestion of the parental DNA with DpnI, the amplified DNA incorporated with the nucleotide substitution was transformed intoEscherichia coli (XL 1- Blue strain). The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The alanine substitutions of Leu-222, Gln-223, Leu-232, and Glu-240 were carried out in N145/pGEX2T plasmid according to the methods of Mikaelian and Sergeant (30Mikaelian I. Sergeant A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 376Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Briefly, four PCR primers, with two at one end, one at the other end of the insert, and one containing the substitution nucleotides in the middle of the primer, were grouped for two rounds of PCR amplifications. The final PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and inserted into pGEX2T vector. In the same way, alanine substitution of Arg-153, single asparagine substitition of Leu-151 and Leu-152, and double substitutions of Leu-151/Leu-152 with asparagine in the p25nck5a were also generated. The designed nucleotide substitution was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid DNA used in this study was purified either by a standard alkaline lysis miniprep protocol (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R.

The nucleotide sequences of all the PCR-amplified DNA were determined by the chain termination method usingT7SequencingTM kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The DNA was sequenced either in the pBluescript KS+ vector (Strategene) using T3 (5′-GCAATTAACCCTCACTAAAG-3′) and T7 primers (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′) or in the pGEX2T vector (Pharmacia) with sense primer (5′-CAGCAAGTATATAGCATGGC-3′) and antisense primer (5′-GGAGCTGCATGTGTCAGAGG-3′).

For expression of the GST-fusion proteins, E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was freshly transformed with the DNA constructs, and cells were cultured toA600 = 1.2 and then stimulated with 0.2 mm of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at room temperature overnight. Cells were then lysed with a French press (1100 p.s.i.) in MTPBS (150 mm NaCl, 16 mmNa2HPO4, 4 mmNaH2PO4) containing 2 mm DTT, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, the GST-fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-agarose (Sigma). In vitro Cdk5 kinase assay was carried out as described previously (18Lew J.

Cdk5 and its activator were reconstituted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mg/ml BSA at 30 °C for 1 h. The histone kinase activity of the reconstituted Cdk5 complex was measured in 30 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm histone H1 peptide, and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (400 cpm/pmol) at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of acetic acid, and the incorporation of phosphate into the histone H1 peptide was measured by a scintillation counter. An active Cdk2 kinase was reconstituted in vitro by incubation of GST-Cdk2 (18 ng), protein A-poly(His) fused cyclin A, partially purified CAK from bovine thymus, 0.5 mm ATP in kinase assay buffer (30 mm MOPS, pH7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium fluoride) at 30 °C for 60 min.

Briefly, bovine brain (1 kg) was homogenized in buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.6 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.3 mg/ml benzamidine, and 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. The crude homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant (S100) was incubated with either GST-p25 or other mutated GST-p25 in the homogenization buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and 2 mm DTT at 4 °C for 12 h. Cdk5 complexes were then precipitated by the addition of glutathione-beads, and the beads were washed three times with MTPBS containing 2 mm DTT and resuspended in 2 × concentrated SDS protein sample buffer. The bound bovine brain Cdk5 was then analyzed by Western blotting with antibody against Cdk5. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad) membrane. The membrane was blocked by 10% skim milk in blotting buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20)) and probed with polyclonal anti-Cdk5 antibody at 2 μg/ml in blotting buffer containing 10% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Signal was developed with ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) according to the protocol of the supplier. Mammalian brains contain Cdk5 activators p35nck5aand p39nck5ai, which are specifically expressed in neurons of central nervous tissue (17Tsai L.-H. Delalle I. Caviness Jr., V.S. Chae T. Harlow E.

Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the two proteins reveals a highly conserved region, expanding approximately 150 amino acid residues (Fig.1). Earlier studies have identified a number of recombinant truncated forms of Nck5a and Nck5ai that are capable of maximally activating Cdk5; these are p25nck5a, p21nck5a, and p30nck5ai (18Lew J.

All contain this conserved region except that p21nck5a ends at residue 291, whereas the C terminus of the conserved region of Nck5a is glutamate 292 (Fig. 1). To test whether or not this conserved core region alone can activate Cdk5, this region of Nck5a, starting at amino acid residue Gln-145 and ending at Glu-292, was expressed in E. coli as a GST-fusion protein. The fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on a glutathione column and then tested for the ability to activate a bacterially expressed GST-Cdk5. Fig.2 A shows that the fusion protein was able to activate Cdk5 in a dose-dependent manner to a maximum level of kinase activity (N145 in Fig. 2 A) comparable with that achieved by p25nck5a. The corresponding region in Nck5ai was also able to fully activate Cdk5 (data not shown). Previous studies have shown that the kinase reconstituted from the bacterially expressed Cdk5 and p25nck5a displays a specific kinase activity similar to or higher than that of the homogeneous preparation of brain neuronal cdc2-like kinase, the heterodimer of Cdk5 and p25nck5a, purified from bovine brain (15Tsai L.-H.

Thus, results of Fig. 2 indicate that the conserved regions of the two Cdk5 activators contain all the structural elements required for Cdk5 activation.Figure 2Binding and activation of Cdk5 by the N-terminal deletion mutants of p35 nck5a . A, dose-dependent activation of Cdk5 by N-terminal deletion mutants. A series of N-terminal deletions together with GST-p25nck5a and GST-p21nck5a were in vitro reconstituted with 30 nm GST-Cdk5 as described under “Materials and Methods” in a dose-dependent manner, and the histone kinase activity of these Cdk5 complexes were assayed in 30 mm MOPS, pH7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 100 μm histone H1 peptide, and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (400 cpm/pmol) at 30 °C for 30 min. B, binding of N-terminal deletion mutants of p35nck5a to bovine brain Cdk5. The bovine brain 100,000 ×g supernatant was prepared (see “Materials and Methods”), and the native bovine brain Cdk5 was then precipitated by these N-terminal deleted GST-fusion proteins of Nck5a (see “Materials and Methods”). The precipitated Cdk5 was detected by immunoblot with a polyclonal anti-Cdk5 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine whether or not the conserved region represented the minimal size of the protein required for Cdk5 activation, a set of N-terminal deletions were generated by PCR amplification and cloned into pGEX2T as described under “Materials and Methods.” These GST-fusion proteins were expressed, affinity purified, and tested for their abilities to activate GST-Cdk5. As shown in Fig. 2 A, while the truncated Nck5a missing the first 144 amino acid residues showed full Cdk5 activation activity, deletion of 162 or more amino acid residues from the N-terminal completely abolished the ability of the protein to activate Cdk5. Thus, at least some of the structural elements essential for Cdk5 activation are located between residues 145 to 162. As the failure of a Nck5a derivative to activate Cdk5 does not preclude the protein from displaying high affinity association with Cdk5, the ability of the truncated forms of Nck5a to bind Cdk5 has been examined. Bovine brain extract 100,000 × g supernatant contains a high amount of the monomeric form of Cdk5, which may undergo high affinity association with various forms of Nck5a derivatives and Nck5a homologous proteins to form active forms of Cdk5 (33Lee K.-Y. Rosales J.L. Tang D. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1538-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To test the ability of the truncated forms of Nck5a to bind Cdk5, each of the expressed GST-fusion proteins was incubated with an aliquot of bovine brain 100,000 × g supernatant and then affinity precipitated by using glutathione beads. After thorough washing of the beads, the precipitated protein was analyzed by Western immunoblot for the existence of Cdk5. Fig. 2 B shows that Cdk5 coprecipitated with all the activating derivatives of Nck5a but none of the inactive derivatives. The procedure used could detect only high affinity association of Cdk5. The possibility that some of the inactive derivatives of Nck5 could associate weakly with Cdk5 is not ruled out. To more precisely map the N-terminal boundary of the Cdk5 activation domain, we generated a second set of N-terminal deletion mutants of Nck5a by PCR strategy as outlined above. Fig. 3 shows that deletion of five amino acid residues from the N145 mutant still allowed the remaining Nck5a to associate with Cdk5 and to fully activate the enzyme, but removal of four additional residues abolished the ability of the protein to activate Cdk5 and to undergo high affinity association with Cdk5. Thus, the four amino acid residues, Glu-150, Leu-151, Leu-152, and Arg-153, contain structural elements indispensable for Cdk5 activation and high affinity Cdk5 binding. To further characterize these four N-terminal residues with respect to the contribution to Cdk5 binding and activation, we introduced individual or double amino acid substitutions in this region by site-directed mutagenesis. These mutant proteins were expressed as GST-fusion proteins and used in the Cdk5 binding and activation studies as described above for the truncation protein mutants. As shown in Fig.4, substitution of Arg-153 by an alanine had little or no effect on the maximal Cdk5 activation of the protein. On the other hand, substitution of Glu-150 by an alanine resulted in 43% reduction in the maximal Cdk5 activation of the protein (Table I). The result suggests that Glu-150 may be considered to be the N terminus of the Cdk5 activation domain of Nck5a, at least in terms of maximal kinase activation.Figure 4Characterization of150ELLR153 of N150nck5a in terms of Cdk5 activation and association by the site-directed mutants in this region. A, dose-dependent Cdk5 activation by the site-directed mutant proteins. Different site-directed mutants in the region of 150ELLR153 were generated as GST-fusion proteins (see “Materials and Methods”), which were then used to activate Cdk5 (30 nm) in a dose-dependent manner. The Cdk5 activity of Cdk5-p25 and Cdk5-Ala-153 is amplified in the inset of this figure.B, Cdk5 binding by these site-directed mutants. Binding of bovine brain Cdk5 by these mutant proteins and immunoblotting using polyclonal antibody against Cdk5 was carried out as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table ISummary of substitution mutants for Cdk5 activationNck5a and derivativesResidues substitutedProtein concentration for 50% activationMaximum activation1-aMaximal activation of Cdk5 activated by p25 is taken as 100%.Wild typeMutantnm%p25p25NA1-bNA, not available.9.23100Ala-150Glu-150Ala-150520.457.1Ala-151Leu-151Ala-151176.1100.9Ala-152Leu-152Ala-152208.292.3Ala-153Arg-153Ala-15324.989.5Ala-151, Ala-152Leu-151, Leu-152Ala-151, Ala-152287.134.4Asn-151Leu-151Asn-151312.057.2Asn-152Leu-152Asn-152432.038.1Asn-151, Asn-152Leu-151, Leu-152Asn-151, Asn-152NA0Ala-221Glu-221Ala-221297.845.5Ala-222Leu-222Ala-222120.281.9Ala-223Gln-223Ala-22350.098.4Ala-232Leu-232Ala-23274.795.7Ala-240Glu-240Ala-24054.07.0Ala-288Asp-288Ala-288484.126.9Ala-289Leu-289Ala-289874.75.0Ala-290Lys-290Ala-29058.684.0Ala-291Asn-291Ala-29152.983.01-a Maximal activation of Cdk5 activated by p25 is taken as 100%.1-b NA, not available. Open table in a new tab Both Leu-151 and Leu-152 appear to contribute to Cdk5 activation activity of the protein by participating in hydrophobic interactions. While substitution of Leu-151 or Leu-152 by an alanine had little effect on the ability of the protein to achieve maximal Cdk5 activation, single substitution mutants with asparagine at the position 151 or 152 showed markedly reduced maximal Cdk5 activation of the protein, to 57.2 or 38.1%, respectively (Fig. 4 A and TableI). The suggestion that the hydrophobic residues Leu-151 or Leu-152 are important for Cdk5 activation was further tested by examining the double substitution mutants of the protein at these positions. When both Leu-151 and Leu-152 were substituted by less bulky alanine, the maximal Cdk5 activation achieved by the mutant protein was reduced to 34.4% of that of the parent protein. The double substitution mutant with hydrophilic asparagine at positions 151 and 152 was found to have completely lost the ability to activate Cdk5 (Table I). The possibility, that the two leucine residues Leu-151 and Leu-152 appear to be critically involved in the Nck5a and Cdk5 interaction because they exist at the immediate N-terminal region of the protein derivatives, has been considered.

Biological activity was destroyed by preincubation with peptideN-glycosidase F (PNGase F) and endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (O-glycosidase) but not by neuraminidase or trypsin. Antibody reactivity was destroyed by treatment with periodate, indicating carbohydrate moieties to be the antigenic determinants. Antigenic activity was also reduced by treatment with PNGase F andO-glycosidase and was completely destroyed by treatment with chondroitinase ABC but was unaffected by treatment with either trypsin or chymotrypsin, confirming that the N- andO-linked sulfated oligosaccharide chains were both the antigenic and biological determinants.Biosynthetic labeling of MAC16 cells using a combination of [35S]sulfate and [6-3H]GlcN gave a single component of Mr 24,000 containing both radiolabels. Similar material could not be isolated from a cell line (MAC13) originating from a tumor that does not cause cachexia in vivo. Digestion of 3H/35S material with PNGase F produced two fragments of Mr 14,000 and 10,000 containing both radiolabels, and digestion withO-glycosidase produced three fragments ofMr 14,000, 6,000, and 4,000, the first two contained both radiolabels and the third contained only 3H. Digestion of the fragment of Mr 14,000 released by PNGase F with O-glycosidase also gave fragments ofMr 6,000 and 4,000. The products from both digestions were acidic as determined by anion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The negative charge on the fragment ofMr 4,000 was removed by treatment with alkaline phosphatase. This suggests that the charge originated from phosphate residues, and this has been confirmed by biosynthetic labeling of MAC16 cells with [32P]orthophosphate, where radiolabel was incorporated into material of Mr 24,000 and into the fragment of Mr 4,000 after treatment with O-glycosidase. To determine the size of the polypeptide core MAC16 cells were biosynthetically labeled withl-[2,5-3H]His which after chemical deglycosylation produced a major component ofMr 4,000. These results suggest a model for theMr 24,000 material consisting of a central polypeptide chain of Mr 4,000 and with phosphate residues that may be attached to the polypeptide or a short oligosaccharide chain containing GlcN, one O-linked sulfated oligosaccharide chain containing GlcN, and ofMr 6,000 and one N-linked sulfated oligosaccharide chain of Mr 10,000 also containing GlcN.

Depletion of skeletal muscle is an important factor contributing to the decreased survival of cancer patients with loss of cardiac and respiratory muscles being most important. A decreased nutrient intake plays an important role in wasting of lean body mass in cancer cachexia, but it appears that it does not fully account for the changes observed (1Evans W.K. Makuch R. Clamon G.H. Feld R. Weiner R.S. Moran E. Blum R. Shepherd F.A. Jeejeebhoy K.W. DeWys W.D. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 3347-3353PubMed Google Scholar). Although protein synthesis is decreased (2Rennie M.J. Edwards R.H.T. Emery P.W. Clin. Physiol. 1983; 3: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), an accelerated protein breakdown accounts in large part for the muscle wasting observed (3Lundholm K. Bennegard K. Eden E. Svaninger G. Emery R.W. Rennie M.J. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4807-4811PubMed Google Scholar). Several factors have been postulated as signals for this increased muscle proteolysis including tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukins 1 and 6 (4Bistrian B.R. Schwartz J. Istfan N.W. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1992; 200: 220-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 5Garcia-Martinez C. Lopez-Soriano F.J. Argiles J.M. Cancer Lett. 1994; 76: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). While continuous infusion of the cytokines in vivo has been shown to increase protein degradation in skeletal muscle, none of the cytokines produced a direct stimulation of proteolysis when incubated in vitro (4Bistrian B.R. Schwartz J. Istfan N.W. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1992; 200: 220-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 5Garcia-Martinez C. Lopez-Soriano F.J. Argiles J.M.

A novel material of Mr 24,000 that appears to fulfill the function of triggering muscle proteolysis during the process of cancer cachexia (6Todorov P. McDevitt T. Cariuk P. Coles B. Deacon M.

Nature. 1996; 379: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) has been purified from a cachexia-inducing mouse tumor (MAC16). This material was capable of inducing muscle protein degradation in isolated gastrocnemius muscle preparations and of inducing weight loss in vivo and will be referred to as proteolysis inducing factor (PIF). 1The abbreviations used are: PIF, proteolysis inducing factor; PNGase F, peptide: N-glycosidase F;O-glycosidase, endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PBS, Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl) ethyl]glycine. Similar, if not identical, material was isolated from the urine of patients with pancreatic carcinoma and weight loss (7Todorov P. Cariuk P. McDevitt T. Coles B. Fearon K. Tisdale M. Nature. 1996; 379: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Structural studies of PIF indicated a short peptide chain ofMr 2,000, which was extensively glycosylated at both Asn and Ser residues (7Todorov P. Cariuk P. McDevitt T. Coles B. Fearon K. Tisdale M. Nature. 1996; 379: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Enzymatic degradation suggested that some of the carbohydrate chains contained sulfate residues, whereas lectin blotting (6Todorov P. McDevitt T. Cariuk P. Coles B. Deacon M. Tisdale M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1256-1261PubMed Google Scholar) indicated the presence of GlcNAc. The material bound strongly to albumin to form a species ofMr 69,000, probably through the sulfate residues which would produce a strong electrostatic linkage. Recent studies (8Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20431-20436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) show that cell-bound albumin binds peptidoglycan, heparin, and sulfated heparinoids as a complex of Mr 70,000. The purpose of the present investigation was to characterize PIF in terms of the number, type, and attachment of the carbohydrate chains to the peptide backbone as well as determining the role of the carbohydrate chains in antibody reactivity and protein degradative activity in isolated gastrocnemius muscle. RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium with and withoutl-histidine and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, Scotland, United Kingdom.d-[1,6-3H]GlcN hydrochloride (specific activity 422.3 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont Ltd., Hertfordshire, United Kingdom, and Na235SO4(specific activity 10–100 mCi/mmol)l-[2,5-3H]histidine (specific activity 56 Ci/mmol), [32P]orthophosphate (10 mCi/ml), and Na125I (1 mCi/10 μl) were purchased from Amersham Int., Bucks, United Kingdom.

Polyvinylchloride assay plates were purchased from Costar, Cambridge, MA and IODO-BEADS were from Pierce. A Glycofree™ deglycosylation kit was purchased from Oxford Glycosystems, Oxford, United Kingdom. Pure strain female NMRI mice were obtained from our own breeding colony. Female NMRI mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and their gastrocnemius muscles were quickly ligated, dissected out, and placed in ice-cold isotonic saline. To minimize diurnal variation and to ensure animals were in the fed state all animals were sacrificed between 9 and 10 a.m. The muscles were blotted, weighed, and carefully tied via tendon ligatures to stainless steel incubation supports (9Wu G. Thompson J.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This prevents contraction and improves protein balance and energy status (10Baracos V.E. Goldberg A.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C588-C595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein degradation was measured by tyrosine release, since tyrosine rapidly equilibrates between intracellular pools and the medium and is neither synthesized nor degraded. Muscles were preincubated in RPMI 1640 (3 ml) lacking phenol red in the presence of serum (280 μl) for 30 min at 37 °C in an atmosphere saturated with O2:CO2(19:1). The muscles were rinsed and incubated for a further 2 h in Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer, containing 6 mmd-glucose, 1.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 130 μg/ml cycloheximide with continuous gassing. At the end of the incubation the buffer was removed, deproteinized with ice-cold 30% trichloroacetic acid (0.2 ml), centrifuged at 2800 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant used for the measurement of tyrosine by a fluorimetric method (11Waalkes T.P. Udenfriend S. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1957; 50: 733-736PubMed Google Scholar) at 570 nm on a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 luminescence spectrometer. The two cell lines MAC16 and MAC13 were derived from the solid tumors grown in vivo and were a gift from Prof. J. A. Double and Dr. M. Bibby (University of Bradford, Yorkshire, United Kingdom). The MAC16 cells were microbiologically free and grew in suspension, while the MAC13 grew as a monolayer in RPMl 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Cells were grown in progressively lower fetal bovine serum concentrations, and a level of 1.5% was used for the labeling experiment. Cells (108) were resuspended in RPMI 1640 (100 ml) containing 1.5% dialyzed fetal calf serum and Na235SO4 (1 μCi/ml), and [3H]GlcN (2 μCi/ml) or [3H]His (5 μCi/ml) or [32P]orthophosphate (2 μCi/ml) was added. The cells were incubated under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C for 48 h and sedimented by low speed centrifugation (1500 rpm for 5 min on a bench-top centrifuge). The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and dissociated using an ultrasonic oscillator. Debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 rpm for 20 min), and solid ammonium sulfate (80% w/v) was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was stored overnight at 4 °C. The precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 mmTris·HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and salt was removed by ultrafiltration with an Amicon filtration cell containing a membrane filter with a molecular weight cut-off of 10,000 against the same solution. The concentrated sample was loaded onto an affinity column containing mouse monoclonal antibody (6Todorov P. McDevitt T. Cariuk P. Coles B. Deacon M. Tisdale M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1256-1261PubMed Google Scholar) coupled to Affi-Gel Hz (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, United Kingdom) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0. After overnight circulation at a flow rate of 5 ml/h, the column was washed with 10 mmTris·HCl, pH 8.0, and the retained material was eluted with 100 mm glycine HCl, pH 2.5, into tubes containing 1m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, for neutralization. The fractions were counted for radioactivity using a Packard 2000 CA liquid scintillation analyzer. Enzyme treatments were performed as follows: PNGase F (1 unit/20 μl) for 24 h at 37 °C in 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm EDTA and 0.2 mm PMSF;O-glycosidase (1 milliunit/20 μl) for 20 h at 37 °C in 100 mm phosphate/citrate, pH 6.0; neuraminidase (1.2 milliunits/ml) for 16 h at 37 °C in 50 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.0, containing 2 mm CaCl2; sulfatase (type H-1 from Helix pomatia), (16 units/ml) for 24 h at 37 °C in 200 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0; endo-β-galactosidase for 20 min at 37 °C in 50 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.8; alkaline phosphatase (5 units) for 18 h at 37 °C in 0.5 m NH4HCO3, pH 8.5; chondroitinase AC (1 unit/ml) for 18 h at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, containing 50 mm NaCl; chondroitinase ABC (2 units/ml) for 18 h at 37 °C in 0.25m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0. In all cases buffers contained 0.5 mm PMSF and 1 mm dithiothreitol to inhibit proteolytic degradation. Trypsin (300 μg/ml), chymotrypsin (300 μg/ml), and pepsin (200 μg/ml) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm CaCl2 and Pronase (predigested for 10 min at 37 °C) for 1 h at 37 °C (4.3 units/ml) in 100 mmTris·HCl, pH 8.0. Both chondroitinase AC and ABC were assayed before use using chondroitin A as substrate. The reaction rate was monitored by measuring the increase in absorbance at 232 nm. Enzyme activity calculated from the initial rate and using E = 3800m−1 for reaction products at pH 8 was 2.85 and 2.70 μmol/min for 1 unit of chondroitinase ABC and AC, respectively. Chemical deglycosylation by anhydrous trifluoromethane sulfonic acid was achieved with a Glycofree™ deglycosylation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nitrous acid deamination was carried out on the sample (in 50 μl of water) kept at room temperature for 10 min. The products of the reaction were then analyzed on a column of Sephadex G-50. Samples were divided into two and immobilized on a 96-well polyvinylchloride assay plate overnight at 4 °C. The liquid was removed by aspiration, and the wells were washed three times with PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 (200 μl). Blocking solution (200 μl of PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 3% bovine serum albumin) was added to the wells, and the plate was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. One-half of the sample was incubated with the monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml) in blocking solution (100 μl) for 1 h at room temperature, while the other half was incubated in the same solution but in the absence of the antibody. After removal of the antibody solution the wells were washed six times before the addition of a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin, diluted 1 in 500 in blocking solution (100 μl/well), and the plates were incubated for a further 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were washed six times, and then the substrate solution,o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (0.04%), hydrogen peroxide (0.012%) in 0.15 m phosphate citrate buffer, pH 5.0 (100 μl/well), was added for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.2 m H2SO4 (50 μl/well), and the absorbance was determined at 492 nm using a microplate reader (Anthos Labtec Instruments). When isolated mouse gastrocnemius muscle was incubated with serum from mice bearing the MAC16 tumor and with a weight loss between 2 and 4.4 g an increased protein degradation was observed as measured by tyrosine release (Table I). This effect was attenuated by incubation of the serum with monoclonal antibody prior to addition to the muscle preparation. An increased tyrosine release could also be produced by addition of affinity purified antigen to serum from non-tumor-bearing mice (Table I), thus confirming that this material was the serum component responsible for the degradation of skeletal muscle proteins. The increased tyrosine release produced by the affinity purified antigen was abolished by preincubation with PNGase F,O-glycosidase, and sulfatase but unaffected by treatment with neuraminidase or trypsin. These results suggest that protein degradation is mediated by N- and O-linked carbohydrate chains in the molecule.Table IEffect of affinity purified antigen (Ag) and serum from MAC16 mice with established cachexia on tyrosine release from gastrocnemius muscleTreatmentTyrosinenmol/mg/2 hNormal mouse serum37 ± 2Cachectic mouse serum54 ± 61-ap < 0.05 when compared with normal mouse serum.Cachectic mouse serum + antibody35 ± 3Normal mouse serum + Ag67 ± 181-bp < 0.02 when compared with normal mouse serum.Normal mouse serum + Ag + PNGase F28 ± 31-cp < 0.02 when compared with normal mouse serum + Ag.Normal mouse serum + Ag + sulfatase41 ± 41-dp < 0.05 when compared with normal mouse serum + Ag.Normal mouse serum + Ag +O-glycosidase35 ± 41-cp < 0.02 when compared with normal mouse serum + Ag.Normal mouse serum + Ag + neuraminidase65 ± 3Normal mouse serum + Ag + trypsin62 ± 10Solid MAC16 tumors excised from mice with established cachexia were fractionated on an affinity column containing the MAC16 monoclonal antibody as described (6Todorov P.

Using this procedure tyrosine release when trypsin was added to serum did not differ significantly from that observed with normal mouse serum. A similar relationship was obtained for antigen binding activity (TableII). Immunological activity was completely destroyed by treatment with periodate, indicating that the carbohydrate moieties are involved in the epitope. Antibody binding activity was inhibited by PNGase F, O-glycosidase, and sulfatase (Table II) but unaffected by treatment with neuraminidase or chymotrypsin, indicating that N- and O-linked carbohydrate chains are the antigenic determinants. In addition antigen reactivity was reduced by treatment with chondroitinase AC and completely destroyed by treatment with chondroitinase ABC but was unaffected by treatment with endo-β-galactosidase. Since the latter enzyme only hydrolyzes internal β-galactoside linkages of oligosaccharides having non-sulfated β-galactose residues, these results suggest that the principal immunological determinants reside in sulfated oligosaccharide chains and that the material is a glycoprotein or proteoglycan.Table IIStudies of antigenic determinants of proteolysis-inducing factorTreatmentAntigen binding activity2-aValues given are mean ± S.E. for three determinations per point.(A492)None0.24 ± 0.031Trypsin0.17 ± 0.021Chymotrypsin0.21 ± 0.006Neuraminidase0.29 ± 0.017O-Glycanase0.11 ± 0.016PNGase F0.16 ± 0.014Keratanase0.26 ± 0.003Sulfatase0.11 ± 0.02Chondroitinase AC0.17 ± 0.02Chondroitinase ABC0.01 ± 0.01Alkaline phosphatase0.13 ± 0.012-a Values given are mean ± S.E. for three determinations per point. Open table in a new tab To obtain information on the nature of the linkage and the number and types of glycan chains, MAC16 cells were doubly labeled with [35S]sulfate and [3H]GlcN, and the antigen was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and affinity chromatography. The elution profile from the affinity column showed a single band of radioactivity containing both radiolabels (Fig.1 A), which represented 13% of the35S and 15% of the 3H radiolabel from the ammonium sulfate precipitate. This material showed a single band of radioactivity corresponding to a Mr of 24,000 on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B). Similar material could not be isolated from a cell line (MAC13) originating from a tumor that does not produce cachexia in vivo. Fractionation of the MAC16 material on a Sephadex G-50 column under dissociating conditions confirmed a single band of Mr 24,000 that contained both35S and 3H (Fig. 2 A). The Mr of this material was the same as that previously isolated from the MAC16 tumor using a combination of affinity and reverse phase hydrophobic chromatography (7Todorov P. Cariuk P. McDevitt T. Coles B. Fearon K. Tisdale M. Nature. 1996; 379: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Identical sham incubations (without PNGase F) showed no radioactivity eluting at positions corresponding to the released material. Re-chromatography of this material after overnight digestion with PNGase F gave two bands of radioactivity eluting at positions corresponding toMr of 14,000 and 10,000 (Fig. 2 B). Both fragments contained 3H and 35S. Digestion of the Mr 24,000 material withO-glycosidase and fractionation on Sephadex G-50 showed conversion to three bands of radioactivity corresponding toMr of 14,000, 6,000, and 4,000 (Fig.2 C). Incubation with buffer in the absence ofO-glycosidase showed no degradation of theMr 24,000 material. The first two bands contained both 3H and 35S, and the band ofMr 4,000 contained only 3H. Treatment of the material of Mr 14,000 produced from PNGase F digestion with O-glycosidase converted it into two fractions corresponding to Mr of 6,000 and 4,000 (Fig. 2 D).Figure 2Elution profile of affinity purified material shown in Fig. 2 on a Sephadex G-50 column (40 × 1.5 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.0, containing 0.2m NaCl and eluted at 6 ml/h.Fractions (0.7 ml) were collected and assayed for 35S (•) and 3H (○) radioactivity using a dual counting procedure. A, without treatment. B, after 24 h treatment with recombinant PNGase F at pH 8.0. C, after 20 h incubation with O-glycosidase at pH 6.0. D, enzymatic digestion of the fragment of Mr 14,000 shown in B with O-glycosidase. Treatment with the incubation buffers alone had not effect on the elution position of theMr 24,000 material on the Sephadex G-50 column. The PNGase F was free of protease, endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase H/endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase F, and did not contain glycosidase activity. The O-glycosidase was also free of protease and contaminating glycosidases.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the acidity of the charged groups on each of the oligosaccharide chains, the Mr 24,000 material was subjected to enzymatic digestion as above, and the products were fractionated on a DEAE-cellulose column under the influence of a linear gradient from 0 to 0.3 m NaCl. The identity of the eluted peaks was determined by exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-50. Anion exchange chromatography after digestion with PNGase F gave two bands eluting at 0.20 m NaCl (Mr10,000) and 0.28 m NaCl (Mr 14,000) (Fig. 3). Digestion with O-glycosidase gave three bands that all adhered to the DEAE-cellulose column in order of elution 0.20 m NaCl (Mr 6,000), 0.24m NaCl (Mr 4,000), and 0.29m NaCl (Mr 14,000) (Fig.4). In both cases there was no further fractionation between the 3H- and 35S-labeled oligosaccharide chains. Although the O-linked oligosaccharide chain ofMr 4,000 did not contain sulfate residues as determined by biosynthetic labeling, it was more acidic than the sulfated chains of Mr 6,000 and 10,000, as determined by the concentration of NaCl required to elute it from the DEAE-cellulose column.Figure 4Elution profile of radioactivity determined as 35S (•) and 3H (○) in the oligosaccharide chains released after enzymatic deglycosylation withO-glycosidase (A).The bands eluting at 0.29 m NaCl (B), 0.20 m NaCl (C), and 0.24 m NaCl (D) were further fractionated on a Sephadex G-50 column. The conditions for the DEAE-cellulose column are given in the legend to Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The nature of the charged groups on this non-sulfated oligosaccharide chain was investigated by digestion with either neuraminidase or phosphatase followed by fractionation of the products by anion exchange chromatography. After treatment of the oligosaccharide with neuraminidase, the product still adhered to the DEAE-cellulose column and eluted at 0.24 m NaCl, suggesting the absence of sialic acid residues. However, after incubation with alkaline phosphatase the acid group was removed and the product no longer attached to the anion exchange column, although the apparent Mr was not affected (results not shown). The Mr of the intact molecule was also unaffected by alkaline phosphatase as determined by exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-50. This suggests that phosphate residues are responsible for the negative charge on theO-glycosidase digestion product of Mr4,000. Antibody binding activity of the Mr24,000 material was reduced by 53% after treatment with alkaline phosphatase (Table II), and immunoreactivity on Western blotting was completely destroyed, suggesting that the phosphate residues are also important antigenic determinants. To confirm the presence of phosphate groups on the chain of Mr 4,000, MAC16 cells were biosynthetically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and the antigen was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and affinity chromatography as before. The 32P was confined to a single band of Mr 24,000 as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5 A) and exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-50 (Fig. 5 B). Treatment with PNGase F (Fig. 5 , A and C) or chondroitinase AC (Fig. 5 A) yielded a single fraction containing32P of Mr 14,000. Digestion of the material of Mr 24,00"

Osipov A.N. Day B.W. Zayas-Rivera B. Kagan V.E. Elsayed N.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6689-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The proposed antioxidant mechanism of NO involves reduction of oxoferryl-derived radicals (24Gorbunov N.V. Osipov A.N. Day B.W. Zayas-Rivera B. Kagan V.E. Elsayed N.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6689-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Whether this mechanism operates in cells remained unclear. In the present work, we attempted to elucidate the antioxidant role of NO against intracellular oxoferryl hemoglobin-induced oxidative stress. We studied the effects of NO on t-BuOOH-induced, heme and non-heme iron-dependent oxidation of membrane phospholipids and cytotoxicity in a subline of human erythroleukemic K562 cells in which concentrations of endogenous hemoglobin can be easily manipulated. Human hemoglobin (Hb), tert-butylhydroperoxide, sodium hydrosulfite (dithionite), hemin, andl-α-phosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoyl-(C18:1 (cis)-9) (DPPC) were obtained from Sigma. Potassium phosphate (monobasic) was purchased from Fisher. 9-cis,11-trans13-trans15-cis-octadecatetraenoic acid (cis-parinaric acid, PnA) was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). NOC-15, (Z)-1-[N-(3-ammoniopropyl)-N-(n-propyl)amino]-diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate] (PAPA NONOate) was from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). AMVN, 2,2′-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) was obtained from Polysciences, Inc. (Warrington, PA); Sephadex G-25 columns were obtained from Pharmacia LKB (Uppsala, Sweden). K/VP.5 cells used for most of the experiments described are a subline of human erythroleukemia K562 cells selected for resistance to the anticancer agent etoposide (26Ritke M.K. Roberts D. Allan W.P. Raymond J. Bergoltz V.V. Yalowich J.C. Br. J. Cancer. 1994; 69: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in continuous culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 7.5% iron-supplemented calf serum. K/VP.5 cells were chosen for study because it was found that intracellular Hb was 25 pmol/106 cell compared with 5 pmol/106cell in parental K562 cells. This permitted us to discriminate a Hb-dependent t-BuOOH toxicity to the cells from the total iron-catalyzed toxicity. To additionally increase the intracellular amount of Hb in K/VP.5 cells, the growth medium was supplemented with hemin (25 μm) for 24 h (27Kawasaki N. Morimoto K. Tanimoto T. Hayakaea T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 382: 289-294Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Extracellular hemin in the growth medium obtained after sedimentation of cells (1,500 × g for 5 min) had a characteristic maximum in the Soret band at 395 nm (Fig. 1 A,spectrum 4). In contrast, spectra of intracellular content (obtained by treatment of cells with alamethicin, see below) as well as spectra of solubilized cell debris (membranes) displayed maxima in the Soret band characteristic of hemoglobin (414 nm) (Fig. 1, Aand B, spectrum 1). Hence, only hemoglobin was present in cells, and excess extracellular hemin was effectively removed by centrifugation. (It is likely that hemin in the growth medium was predominantly residing in complexes with calf serum albumin since the dissociation constant for hemin-albumin complex isKd = 10−8m (28Muller-Eberhard U. Nikkila H. Semin. Hematol. 1989; 26: 86-104PubMed Google Scholar, 29Barnard M.L. Muller-Eberhard U. Turrens J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).) Log phase cells were separated from growth medium by centrifugation (1,500 × g for 5 min). The cell pellet was rinsed twice with L1210 buffer containing 115 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. To prevent redox effects of adventitious iron, all aqueous solutions were treated with Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad). The cells diluted to a density of 1.0 × 106 cell/ml (80 × 106 cell/ml for EPR measurements) were incubated for 10 min in the absence or presence of NOC-15 (20 and 80 nmol/106 cells) releasing NO with a half-life of 76 min, following which t-BuOOH (100 nmol/106 cells) was added to incubate for an additional 60 min. Aliquots of a cell suspension (1.0 × 106 cell/ml) were taken to assess cell viability using trypan blue dye exclusion. Ten million cells were incubated (for 10 min at room temperature) in the presence of an amphiphilic channel-forming peptide, alamethicin (50 μm) to release intracellular Hb (30He K. Ludtke S.J. Huang H.W. Warcester D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15614-15618Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). After centrifugation (100,000 ×g for 20 min), the supernatant was collected, and pelleted cell debris were solubilized in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1% of Triton X-100. Spectra of Hb in the supernatant and of the solubilized membrane pellet were recorded in the range 350–700 nm using a Shimadzu 160U UV-VIS spectrophotometer. Three maxima at 414 nm (Soret band of oxyhemoglobin) as well as at 542 and 576 nm (characteristic of oxyhemoglobin) were observed in spectra of both the supernatants and the solubilized membranes (Fig. 1,A and B). The concentration of Hb in cells was estimated using the molar extinction coefficient for the Hb Soret band (414 nm) of 125,000 m−1 × cm−1. Under the conditions used, no more than 7% total intracellular Hb remained bound to cell membranes (debris) after treatment of cells with alamethicin and release of hemoglobin. No additional maximum characteristic of hemin (at 395 nm) was detectable in the spectra of supernatants or solubilized membranes (Fig. 1, A andB). Additional evidence for the lack of hemin in K/VP.5 cells comes from our EPR measurements. The EPR spectra (and hyperfine splitting constants) for nitrosylated Hb in a model system are similar to that in Hb-enriched K/VP.5 cells (see Figs. 2 and 3). Both of these spectra are dissimilar from that of hemin in liposomes (see Fig. 3,c and d). In addition, EPR spectra obtained from K/VP.5 cells exposed to t-BuOOH contained features typical of protein-centered free radical species (Fig. 4). In contrast, only a signal of t-BuO⋅-alkoxyl radical was detected in the EPR spectrum of hemin integrated into DPPC liposomes (Fig. 4). Thus a part of hemin from the growth medium was integrated into intracellular hemoglobin, and the rest of it (bound to serum proteins in the medium) was removed by centrifugation; no “loose” membrane-bound hemin was present in the cells used in the experiments performed.Figure 3Low temperature EPR spectra of PIN and HIN complexes obtained from the following. a, 20 μm Hb with 20 μm NOC-15 incubated in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 10 min. b, Hb-enriched K/VP.5 cells incubated with 20 nmol of NOC-15/106 cells (obtained by a subtraction of the reconstructed EPR spectrum (A4, Fig. 2) from the spectrum (B2, Fig. 2)). c, 25 μm hemin incorporated into DPPC liposomes (see “Materials and Methods”) incubated with 20 μm NOC-15. d, 25 μm hemin incorporated into DPPC liposomes (see “Materials and Methods”) incubated with 80 μm NOC-15.e, Hb-enriched K/VP.5 cells incubated with 80 nmol of NOC-15/106 cells obtained by a subtraction of the reconstructed EPR spectrum (A4, Fig. 2) from the spectrum (B3, Fig. 2).

Cells in log phase growth were rinsed twice with L1210 buffer, diluted to a density of 1.0 × 106cells/ml, and then incubated with PnA·HSA complex (final concentration of PnA 4 μg/ml) in L1210 buffer at 37 °C for 2 h. After incubation, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and then washed twice with isotonic buffer with HSA. The total amount of PnA metabolically incorporated into membrane phospholipids was less than 1% of fatty acid residues. PnA-treated cells were incubated in the presence of t-BuOOH (100 nmol/106 cells) and/or NOC-15 (20 and 80 nmol/106 cells) as described above. Total lipid extracts from the cells were obtained using a Folch procedure (32Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lipid extract was dissolved in 3:4:0.16 (v/v) hexane/isopropyl alcohol/water (0.15 ml). Lipid extracts were separated by a normal phase HPLC as described previously (31Ritov V.B. Banni S. Yalowich J.C. Day B.W. Claycamp H.G. Corongiu F.P. Kagan V.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1283: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A 5-μm Supelcosil LC-Si column (4.6 × 250 mm) was employed with the following mobile phase flowing at 1 ml/min: solvent A (57:43:1 isopropyl alcohol/hexane/H2O), solvent B (57:43:10 isopropyl alcohol/hexane, 40 mm aqueous ammonium acetate, pH 7.0), 0–3 min linear gradient from 10% B to 37% B, 3–15 min isocratic at 37% B, 15–23 min linear gradient to 100% B, 23–45 min isocratic at 100% B. A Shimadzu HPLC system (model LC-600) equipped with a fluorescence detector (model RF-551) was used. Fluorescence of PnA in eluates was monitored by emission at 420 nm after excitation at 324 nm. Fluorescence data were processed and stored in digital form with Shimadzu EZChrom software. Commercial Hb was mainly in the met (ferric) form. We reduced met-Hb (1 mm solution in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) to its ferrous (oxy-Hb) form using 4-fold excess of sodium dithionite. Pure oxy-Hb was obtained by separation on a Sephadex G-25 column preequilibrated with 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The concentrations of oxy-Hb/met-Hb were calculated as described previously by Winterbourn (33Winterbourn C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) using oxy-Hb extinction coefficient at 577 nm 15.0 mm−1 × cm−1 (33Winterbourn C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Deoxygenation of oxy-Hb was performed by incubating it in a nitrogen atmosphere. Liposomes were prepared from a stock solution of 2 mm DPPC in CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1) containing 0.2 mmhemin. The solvent was evaporated under a stream of N2. Phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.4) was added, and the resulting suspension was sonicated (three 30-s bursts at 65 watts) with a Cole-Parmer Instrument Co. 4710 Series Ultrasonicator (Chicago, IL). To reduce ferric form of hemin to its ferrous form we used sodium dithionite (0.8 mm). Removal of excess dithionite was achieved by gel filtration of liposomes through a Sephadex G-25 column preequilibrated with 100 mm phosphate buffer. Thus prepared hemin-containing liposomes were used for EPR and spectrophotometric measurements. Log phase cells were separated from the growth media as mentioned above. Two different sets of EPR measurements were performed. Cells adjusted to either 1 × 106cell/ml or 80 × 106 cell/ml were incubated for 10 min in the absence or presence of NOC-15 (20 and 80 nmol/106cells, releasing NO with a half-life of 76 min), following which 100 nmol of t-BuOOH/106 cells was added for an additional 60 min. Aliquots of cell suspensions (3 × 106 cells or 20 × 106 cell in 250 μl) were withdrawn, placed into a Teflon tube (3.7 mm internal diameter), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then removed from the tube to perform EPR measurements. For spectrum recording, each sample was placed in an EPR quartz tube (5 mm internal diameter) in such a way that the entire sample was within the effective microwave irradiation area. To obtain discernible EPR signals from low concentrations of cells and reagents in some measurements we used multiple spectra acquisitions (10 per sample) and their computer-assisted averaging (as indicated in the figure legends). EPR measurements were performed on a JEOL-RE1X spectrometer with a variable temperature controller (Research Specialists, Chicago, IL). The spectra were recorded at −170 °C, 320 mT center field, 10 mW power, 0.1 mT field modulation, 25 mT sweep width, 0.1-s time constant. The g factor values were determined relative to external standards, containing Mn2+ (in MgO). Analog signals were converted into digital form and imported to an IBM computer. Intensity of the signals was calculated using a program developed by Duling (34Duling D.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; 104: 105-110Crossref Scopus (892) Google Scholar). The EPR spectra of both control K/VP.5 cells (25 pmol Hb/106 cells) and K/VP.5 cells enriched with Hb (90 pmol Hb/106 cells) displayed only nonspecific free radical signals at g = 2.004 (Fig. 2,A1 and B1), probably resulting from components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (35Lepoivre M.

Incubation of control (nontreated with hemin) K/VP.5 cells with two different concentrations of NOC-15 (20 and 80 nmol/106 cells) resulted in EPR signals with identical profiles (Fig. 2, A2 and A3). We registered four-line anisotropic spectra with (i) principal features atg∥ = 2.04 and g⊥ = 2.015; (ii) additional features at g = 2.07 (a maximun), and g = 1.989 (a trough); (iii) a free radical signal at g = 2.004 (Fig. 2, A2 andA3). Similar spectra, with an axial anisotropic feature atg∥ 2.04 and g⊥ = 2.015, have been previously observed upon exposure of various types of cells to NO (5Drapier J.-C. Pellat C. Henry Y. J. Biol.

In Hb-enriched K/VP.5 cells, treatment with the NO donor (20 and 80 nmol/106 cells) caused EPR spectra with profiles different from those of control K/VP.5 cells. A five-line anisotropic signal with incompletely resolved superfine structure was detected (Fig. 2, B2 andB3). The features g⊥ = 2.04 andg∥ = 2.015 were assigned to non-heme iron dinitrosyl complexes (35Lepoivre M. Flaman J.M. Henry Y. J. Biol.

The signals in Hb-enriched cells, however, also exhibited additional multiplet signals at g = 2.07,g = 2.025, g = 2.004 andg = 1.989. The features at g = 2.07 and g = 1.989 in both control- and Hb-enriched K/VP.5 cells can be assigned to nitrosyl complexes of heme iron, apparently resulting from nitrosylation of intracellular Hb. Indeed, these spectral components in the Hb-enriched K/VP.5 cells were much more intense than in control cells, although partly obscured by signals from non-heme iron dinitrosyl complexes at g⊥ = 2.04 andg∥ = 2.015 (Fig. 2, B2 andB3) Similar signals of nitrosyl complexes of hemoglobin have been shown previously in model systems (42Taketa F.

In this paper, the effects of the nusAcs10allele on the elongation rate of both mRNA and antiterminated RNA were investigated. The results indicate that NusA is required to achieve a high elongation rate of RNA chains carrying the ribosomal antitermination boxA and that antitermination is defective when the rate of transcription elongation is decreased by thenusAcs10 allele. Furthermore, the nusAcs10allele had no significant effects on the elongation rate of normallacZ mRNA during steady state growth, but it abolished the inhibition of lacZ mRNA elongation by guanosine 3′,5′-bis(diphosphate) (ppGpp).

NusA has also been reported to induce pauses during in vitro transcription, to reduce the rate of elongation, and to stimulate termination at intrinsic terminators (7Das A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6711-6716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Schmidt M.C. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Andersen J.T. Jensen K.F.

We have investigated the effect of NusA on transcription elongationin vivo by measuring the RNA elongation rate in a strain containing the nusAcs10 allele. Our results suggest NusA is required both for ribosomal antitermination and for maintaining the high elongation rate of antiterminated RNA, since thenusAcs10 mutant showed a considerable level of premature termination of boxA-lacZ mRNA chains and was unable to sustain a high elongation rate of RNA chains carrying the boxA sequence.

Mizusawa S. Court D.L. Tsugawa A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The first strain was constructed by P1 transduction using thenusAts11 wxz::Tn10 strain YN2458 (17Nakamura Y. Mizusawa S. Court D.L. Tsugawa A. J. Mol.

Biochem. 1988; 175: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) as the recipient. Resistance to tetracycline (5 μg/ml) was selected at 32 °C. After testing for growth on LB broth at 43 °C, a temperature-resistant colony (SØ6100) was chosen. Strain SØ6681 was constructed by transduction of the nusAcs10 strain, SØ6075 (14Andersen J.T. Jensen K.F. Poulsen P. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), with a P1 phage lysate grown on SØ6100 (wxz::Tn10), selecting for resistance to tetracycline on LB broth at 39 °C and isolating a colony unable to grow at 25 °C. The isogenic pair of strains, SØ6718 and SØ6719, was constructed to have the nusAcs10 mutation in the genetic background, MAS90, previously used for measurements of transcription elongation rates (1Vogel U. Jensen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16236-16241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,2Vogel U. Sørensen M. Pedersen S. Jensen K.F. Kilstrup M. Mol.

To facilitate this construction, the recombination-deficient strain, MAS78, was transformed with plasmid pMAS53, which encodes resistance to chloramphenicol, harbors a functional recAgene, and has a temperature-sensitive replication function (a generous gift from M. Sørensen, to be described elsewhere). The transformant, MAS78-pMAS53, was subsequently transduced with a P1 phage lysate grown on SØ6681 selecting for resistance to tetracycline (5 μg/ml) at 39 °C. The transductants were tested for the inability to grow at 25 °C (the nusAcs10 phenotype), sensitivity to nitrofurantoin (the recA phenotype), and sensitivity to chloramphenicol (the loss of plasmid pMAS53). One cold-sensitive colony (a nusAcs10 wxz::Tn10 mutant) and one colony able to grow at 25 °C (a nusA + wxz::Tn10 strain) were chosen and subsequently mated with NF1830 for transfer of the F′lacI q1 lacZ::Tn5 proAB + episome by selecting for resistance to kanamycin on glucose minimal medium at 39 °C. These latter F′ derivatives were named SØ6718 and SØ6719. The bacteria were grown in shaking flasks in A + B medium (20Clark D.J. Maaløe O. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 23: 99-112Crossref Scopus (709) Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2% glucose, 1 μg/ml thiamine, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin at the indicated temperature. Isoleucine starvation was induced by the addition of 0.4 mg/ml valine. Transcription from the PA1/04/03 promoter was induced by the addition of 1 mm IPTG (final concentration). Transformations with plasmids were performed by standard techniques. LB broth medium and solid media were prepared as described by Miller (21Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). RNA sampling and purification was performed as described previously (2Vogel U. Sørensen M. Pedersen S. Jensen K.F. Kilstrup M. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2191-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); dot blots and hybridization were performed as described by Vogel and Jensen (1Vogel U. Jensen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16236-16241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that GeneScreen Plus hybridization transfer membranes from DuPont NEN were used for some experiments instead of GeneScreen membranes. The riboprobe plasmids employed and the procedure for in vitro transcription in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (DuPont NEN) have also been described (1Vogel U. Jensen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16236-16241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Vogel U. Sørensen M. Pedersen S. Jensen K.F. Kilstrup M. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2191-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The radioactivity on the dot blots was quantified on an Instant Imager (Canberra-Packard). The transcription times of the lacZ gene on pUV12 and of theboxA-lacZ construct on pUV16 were determined as the time lag between induction of transcription initiation at the PA1/04/03 promoter by the addition of IPTG and detection of specific hybridization to a probe complementary to the 3′ end of thelacZ transcripts. Transcription elongation rates were calculated by dividing the length of the transcript (3107 nt for pUV12 and 3104 nt for pUV16) with the measured transcription time (2Vogel U. Sørensen M. Pedersen S. Jensen K.F. Kilstrup M. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2191-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 4Vogel U. Jensen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18335-18340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). While the transcription times measured in these experiments were very reproducible, the absolute amount of radioactivity in the dots varied severalfold between identical experiments due to variations in the specific radioactivity of the probe, the number of times it was used, and the type of hybridization membrane employed, i.e.GeneScreen or GeneScreen Plus membranes. Therefore, the slopes of the induction curves are generally meaningless, and they can only be compared for experiments where hybridization was performed in parallel on the same membrane. In most cases, the transcription time was determined in two independent experiments, which were separated in time by days or weeks and included separate inoculation of cultures as well as growth of cells, sampling, preparation of RNA, and dot hybridization. However, to simplify the presentation, the two curves are shown in a normalized way where the radioactivity in the dots from one experiment was multiplied by a constant factor to superimpose the one induction curve on the other. The employed normalization factors ranged from 1 to 25 for the different panels in Fig. 2 and 3. Determination of the instantaneous rates of stable RNA initiations relative to total RNA (rs/rt) was performed as described by Baracchini et al. (22Baracchini E. Glass R. Bremer H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 213: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the cultures (0.5 ml) were labeled with [3H]uridine (10 μCi, 43 Ci/mmol) for 60 s. Total RNA synthesis was determined as the amount of radioactivity in trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material, while ribosomal RNA synthesis was quantified by filter hybridization with plasmid pKK3535 DNA (23Brosius J. Dull T.J. Sleeter D.D. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 148: 107-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar) or pBR322 for determination of background. 32P-Labeled Escherichia coli RNA was used as an internal control of hybridization efficiency. The differential rate of accumulation of RNA was measured photometrically as trichloroacetic acid-precipitable, NaOH-labile material absorbing UV light at 260 nm as described by Vogelet al. (24Vogel U. Pedersen S. Jensen K.F. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1168-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This was performed using a medium containing 0.3 mm [32P]phosphate (∼200 Ci/mol) as described by Vogel et al. (24Vogel U. Pedersen S. Jensen K.F. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1168-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of radioactivity incorporated into the nucleotides was quantified on an Instant Imager (Canberra-Packard). To test the effect of NusA on the rate of transcription elongationin vivo, we used the conditionally lethalnusAcs10 mutation, since the nusA gene can only be deleted in Rho-deficient strains (25Zheng C. Friedman D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7543-7547Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Strains harboring thenusAcs10 mutation are cold-sensitive and unable to grow at temperatures below 30 °C (16Schauer A.T. Carver D.L. Bigelow B. Baron L.S. Friedman D.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The mutation was also shown to cause a defect in N-mediated transcriptional antitermination in bacteriophage λ (16Schauer A.T. Carver D.L. Bigelow B. Baron L.S. Friedman D.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed to impose a defect in ribosomal antitermination, because it causes an increase in the rate of synthesis of tRNAs encoded outside the ribosomal operons, relative to those encoded inside these operons (10Sharrock R.A. Gourse R.L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5275-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The nusAcs10 mutant, SØ6718, and the isogenic nusA + strain, SØ6719, were grown in a glucose minimal medium at 34 °C, which is a semipermissive temperature for the nusAcs10 mutant. The generation times were 60 min for the wild type and 72 min for thenusAcs10 mutant. Transcription elongation rates were measured using the plasmids pUV12 and pUV16 (Fig. 1), which both contain lacZinserted behind the strong IPTG-inducible PA1/04/03promoter. Plasmid pUV12 contains a normal lacZ gene, while pUV16 contains the minimal ribosomal antitermination boxA sequence and flanking regions, i.e. the sequence 5′-CACTGCTCTTTAACAATTTA-3′, inserted between the promoter and the structural lacZ gene. This minimal boxA sequence has previously been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for proper antitermination in vitro and in vivo (6Berg K.L. Squires C. Squires C.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 9Squires C.L. Greenblatt J. Li J. Condon C. Squires C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 970-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Transcription rates were determined following induction of transcription initiation at the PA1/04/03 promoter by the addition of IPTG and hybridization to a probe complementary to the 3′ end of the lacZ transcripts (see “Experimental Procedures”). The transcription time of the unmodified lacZ gene on pUV12 was 90 s during steady state growth of the wild type strain at 34 °C (Fig. 2 A), corresponding to an elongation rate of 35 nt/s. During the stringent response, provoked by inducing starvation for isoleucine, the transcription time increased to 160 s (Fig. 2 C), in agreement with previous results (1Vogel U. Jensen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16236-16241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,2Vogel U. Sørensen M. Pedersen S. Jensen K.F. Kilstrup M. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2191-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For the nusAcs10 mutant the transcription time was 95 s (33 nt/s) during steady state growth (Fig. 2 B), indicating that nusAcs10 does not disturb mRNA chain elongation during steady state growth. However, no inhibition of transcription elongation was observed during the stringent response, since the transcription time was 90 s under these growth conditions (Fig. 2 D). These results suggested that thenusAcs10 allele abolished inhibition of transcription elongation by ppGpp, since the nusAcs10 mutant accumulated even more ppGpp than the wild type strain during the stringent response (Table II).Table IINucleotide pools in the nusAcs10 mutant compared with the nusA+cells (pmol/A436/ml)NucleotidenusA +nusAcs10Steady stateStringent responseSteady stateStringent responseGTP460330640300ATP9509709951100CTP160320190350UTP180240210270ppGpp2431047710 Open table in a new tab For thenusA + strain, the transcription time of the antiterminated boxA-lacZ construct carried on pUV16 was 55 s both during steady state growth at 34 °C and during amino acid starvation (Fig. 3, A and C). This indicates that insertion of the antitermination boxA is sufficient both to elevate the elongation rate and render chain elongation insensitive to ppGpp, as previously observed (4Vogel U. Jensen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18335-18340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In thenusAcs10 mutant, however, the transcription time of theboxA-lacZ gene was 80 s during steady state growth (Fig. 3 B), corresponding to an elongation rate of 38 nt/s, and it increased to about 95 s during the stringent response (Fig.3 D). The elongation rate observed during steady state growth (38 nt/s) is similar to the elongation rate (33 nt/s) found for the normal lacZ mRNA and much lower than the elongation rate of the boxA-lacZ RNA observed in wild type cells (57 nt/s). These results suggest that the nusAcs10 mutant is unable to achieve a high rate of transcription elongation despite the presence of the boxA antitermination sequence. To determine the extent of premature transcription termination within boxA-lacZ during the stringent response, we quantified both the accumulation of 5′ ends, which we interpret as the rate of initiation at the PA1/04/03 promoter, and the accumulation of 3′ ends of the resulting RNA chain (Fig. 4). The slopes of these induction curves, which were made in parallel on the same membrane to ensure uniform hybridization, were identical during steady state growth and during amino acid starvation, both for the wild type and for thenusAcs10 mutant (Fig. 4, A and B). This indicates that transcription initiation at the PA1/04/03 promoter is insensitive to ppGpp, as seen previously (4Vogel U. Jensen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18335-18340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Kingston R.E. Nierman W.C. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2787-2797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the wild type strain, the slopes of the curves representing the accumulation of 3′ ends of the boxA-lacZtranscripts were also identical during steady state growth and amino acid starvation (Fig. 4 C), but for the nusAcs10mutant, the rate of accumulation of 3′ ends of the boxA-lacZtranscript was reduced 4-fold after the onset of amino acid starvation (Fig. 4 D). Therefore, we conclude that the minimal ribosomal boxA sequence is unable to suppress premature transcription termination in a strain harboring the nusAcs10 mutation. The transcription elongation rates measured for the two transcripts under different growth conditions are summarized in TableIII.Table IIISummary of transcription elongation rates in the isogenic pair of strains, SØ6719 (nusA+) and SØ6718 (nusAcs10), grown at 34 ′CGeneGrowth conditionTranscription elongation ratesnusA +nusAcs10nt/slacZExponential3533lacZStarved1938boxA-lacZExponential5738boxA-lacZStarved5733 Open table in a new tab The inhibition of transcription elongation, normally observed during the stringent response, has been proposed by Jensen and Pedersen (26Jensen K.F. Pedersen S. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 89-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to play a major role in the passive regulation of rRNA synthesis by sequestering RNA polymerase in the elongation phase and thus lowering the concentration of free RNA polymerase. Since the nusAcs10mutant did not change the transcription elongation rate of mRNA, it could be used to test if the decreased mRNA elongation rate is important for the regulation of stable RNA synthesis during the stringent response. The rate of total RNA synthesis, measured as the incorporation of [3H]uridine into acid-insoluble material during 60-s pulses (Fig. 5 A) or as the UV absorption of alkaline RNA hydrolysates (not shown), decreased strongly both in the nusA + strain and thenusAcs10 mutant after the onset of amino acid starvation. Furthermore, the parameterrs/rt, which represents the fraction of de novo RNA synthesis devoted to stable RNA, decreased from 0.45 to 0.30 during the stringent response both for the wild type strain and for the nusAcs10 mutant (Fig.5 B). This indicates that relative rates of initiation of mRNA and rRNA synthesis is normally regulated during the stringent response in the nusAcs10 mutant despite the constant RNA chain elongation rate. Our results show that antiterminatedboxA-lacZ RNA is elongated at a slower rate in the nusAcs10 mutant than in the wild type strain, and that the nusAcs10 allele abolishes the inhibition of normallacZ mRNA chain elongation by ppGpp without affecting the elongation rate during steady state growth. The nusAcs10allele contains two different mutations, which, in combination, confer cold sensitivity to the host (27Craven M.G. Friedman D.I. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1485-1491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the two mutations are separated, the λ-plating type is linked to the mutation at nucleotide 634 in the nusA gene. It is therefore possible that the two different effects of nusAcs10, i.e. the decreased elongation rate of antiterminated RNA and the resistance to ppGpp inhibition, are caused by different mutations. The nusAcs10 allele prevented boxA-mediated suppression of polarity in the boxA-lacZ transcript, suggesting that the mutant is unable to antiterminate rRNA normally, in agreement with the observations of Sharrock et al. (10Sharrock R.A. Gourse R.L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5275-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Ribosomal antitermination is equivalent to the suppression of Rho-dependent transcription termination in therrn operons (28Condon C. Squires C. Squires C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 623-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Greenblatt J. Nodwell J.R. Mason S.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and Rho-dependent termination has been proposed to depend on the kinetic coupling between the RNA polymerase and Rho (30Jin D.J. Burgess R.R. Richardson J.P. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1453-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the antiterminated RNA polymerase may simply escape Rho-dependent termination by running away from Rho as suggested by several groups (7Das A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6711-6716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Condon C. Squires C. Squires C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 623-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Jin D.J. Burgess R.R. Richardson J.P. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1453-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Our results are in agreement with this interpretation. The observation that the nusAcs10 mutation caused resistance to inhibition of normal lacZ mRNA elongation by ppGpp indicates that NusA is part of the elongation complex for normal mRNA in vivo. This is in agreement with several previous observations from both in vitro and in vivoexperiments (12Horwitz R.J. Li J. Greenblatt J. Cell. 1989; 51: 631-641Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13Schmidt M.C. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Andersen J.T. Jensen K.F. Poulsen P. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, it also indicates that NusA is important for inhibition of mRNA chain elongation by ppGpp, although Kingstonet al. (15Kingston R.E. Nierman W.C. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2787-2797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) observed that ppGpp inhibited elongation of the early transcript of phage T7 in vitro without adding the NusA protein to the transcription mixtures. We found that the ratio between rRNA and total RNA initiations (rs/rt) decreased from 0.45 to 0.30 following induction of amino acid starvation, both in thenusAcs10 mutant and in the isogenicnusA + strain. This indicates that the ratio between rRNA and mRNA synthesis is normally regulated in thenusAcs10 mutant during amino acid starvation and, thus, that the inhibition of transcription elongation and pausing by ppGpp does not play the major role in the regulation of rRNA synthesis during the stringent response as proposed by Jensen and Pedersen (Ref. 26Jensen K.F. Pedersen S. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 89-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; but see Ref. 31Bremer H. Ehrenberg M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1262: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The nusAcs10 mutant, however, incorporated about 60% more [3H]uracil in RNA during the pulse labeling under conditions of steady state growth (Fig. 5 A). This may be the result of an increased labeling of the UTP pool resulting from the increased GTP pool in the nusAcs10 mutant, because uracil phosphoribosyltransferase is allosterically activated by GTP (32Fast R. Sköld O. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7620-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Jensen K.F. Mygind B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it may be that the nusAcs10 mutant has an increased capacity for total RNA synthesis despite the normal partitioning of RNA polymerase between mRNA and stable RNA initiations (rs/rt). The elevated pool of ppGpp may be taken as an indication of an increased mRNA pool in the nusAcs10 mutant, which has previously been observed following induction of a stable version of thelacZ mRNA (34Sørensen M.A. Jensen K.F. Pedersen S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 441-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In summary, our results strongly indicate that NusA is part of the ribosomal antitermination complex, where it helps RNA polymerase to increase the elongation rate thereby preventing Rho-dependent premature termination, and they suggest a close relationship between a high elongation rate and the degree of antitermination. The results also indicate that NusA is part of the transcription elongation complex for mRNA synthesis and mediates the sensitivity of the elongating RNA polymerase to ppGpp. We thank Michael Sørensen, Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Copenhagen, for letting us use pMAS53 prior to publication.

https://openalex.org/W1971626991,"Phosducin-like protein (PhLP), a widely expressed ethanol-responsive gene (Miles, M. F., Barhite, S., Sganga, M., and Elliott, M. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 10831–10835), is a homologue of phosducin, a known major regulator of Gβγ signaling in retina and pineal gland. However, although phosducin has a well characterized role in retinal phototransduction, function of the PhLP remains unclear. In this study we examine the ability of PhLP to bind Gβγ dimer in vitro and in vivo. Using PhLP glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, we show that PhLP directly binds Gβγ in vitro. Studies with a series of truncated PhLP fusion proteins indicate independent binding of Gβγ to both the amino- and C-terminal halves of PhLP. Protein-protein interactions between Gβγ and PhLP are inhibited by the α subunit of Go and Gi3, suggesting that PhLP can bind only free Gβγ. Finally, we show that PhLP complexes, at least partially, with Gβγin vivo. Following overexpression of epitope-tagged PhLP together with Gβ1γ2 proteins in COS-7 cells, a PhLP-Gβγ complex is co-immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibody directed against the epitope tag. Similarly, polyclonal anti-PhLP antibody co-precipitates endogenous PhLP and Gβγ proteins from NG108-15 cell lysates. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that PhLP is a widely expressed modulator of Gβγ function. Furthermore, because alternate forms of the PhLP transcript are expressed, there may be functional implications for the existence of two Gβγ-binding domains on PhLP. Phosducin-like protein (PhLP), a widely expressed ethanol-responsive gene (Miles, M. F., Barhite, S., Sganga, M., and Elliott, M. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 10831–10835), is a homologue of phosducin, a known major regulator of Gβγ signaling in retina and pineal gland. However, although phosducin has a well characterized role in retinal phototransduction, function of the PhLP remains unclear. In this study we examine the ability of PhLP to bind Gβγ dimer in vitro and in vivo. Using PhLP glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, we show that PhLP directly binds Gβγ in vitro. Studies with a series of truncated PhLP fusion proteins indicate independent binding of Gβγ to both the amino- and C-terminal halves of PhLP. Protein-protein interactions between Gβγ and PhLP are inhibited by the α subunit of Go and Gi3, suggesting that PhLP can bind only free Gβγ. Finally, we show that PhLP complexes, at least partially, with Gβγin vivo. Following overexpression of epitope-tagged PhLP together with Gβ1γ2 proteins in COS-7 cells, a PhLP-Gβγ complex is co-immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibody directed against the epitope tag. Similarly, polyclonal anti-PhLP antibody co-precipitates endogenous PhLP and Gβγ proteins from NG108-15 cell lysates. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that PhLP is a widely expressed modulator of Gβγ function. Furthermore, because alternate forms of the PhLP transcript are expressed, there may be functional implications for the existence of two Gβγ-binding domains on PhLP. Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) play a major role in transmembrane signaling processes by transducing extracellular signals from the superfamily of heptahelical cell surface receptors to their appropriate intracellular effectors (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4714) Google Scholar, 2Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). In its trimeric form, Gαβγ is inactive, and the Gα subunit binds a molecule of GDP. Upon ligand binding, the receptor catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on Gα that causes its activation and dissociation from the tightly bound Gβγ complex. 1Gβ and Gγ are thought to exist as an obligate complex and are thus referred to here as Gβγ even in instances where direct interaction may only involve Gβ. Inactivation and reassociation of the heterotrimer is initiated by the hydrolysis of bound GTP into GDP by an intrinsic GTPase activity of the Gα subunit. It is now known that both the free GTP-bound Gα and the Gβγ dimer can bind and regulate downstream effectors including adenylyl cyclases, phospholipases, and ion channels, and thereby modulate second messenger levels and ion flux (3Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The discovery of several specific Gβγ binding proteins has recently shed light on new roles for Gβγ in the propagation and termination of cellular signaling. The dimer has been shown to recruit β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK) 2The abbreviations used are: βARK, β-adrenergic receptor kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; PhLP, phosducin-like protein; PhLPS, phosducin-like protein, short form (PhLP84–301); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. to its membrane-associated receptor substrate and thus initiate receptor desensitization (4Haga K.

Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). This process occurs via direct binding of Gβγ to the C terminus of a putative pleckstrin homology domain on βARK (6Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the responsiveness of G protein-regulated signaling systems may be directly modulated through the interaction of Gβγ subunits with intracellular regulatory proteins. For instance, phosducin, a phosphoprotein mainly expressed in the retina and pineal gland, inhibits the phototransduction cascade by scavenging βγ subunits of the G protein transducin (Gt), thus preventing their reassociation with the Gtα subunit (7Lee R.H. Lieberman B.S. Lolley R.N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3983-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 8Lee R.H. Ting T.D. Lieberman B.S. Tobias D.E. Lolley R.N. Ho Y.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25104-25112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because phosducin has a higher affinity for Gtβγ than does Gtα, it has been suggested that the formation of the phosducin/Gtβγ complex is a major factor regulating photoreceptor responsiveness (9Yoshida T. Willardson B.M. Wilkins J.F. Jensen G.J. Thornton B.D. Bitensky M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24050-24057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From in vitro binding and co-transfection assays, it was proposed that phosducin may also compete with other targets for Gβγ binding, such as βARK and phospholipase C type β2 (10Hekman M. Bauer P.H. Söhlemann P. Lohse M.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Xu J. Wu D. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2086-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We recently isolated a rat brain cDNA encoding a phosducin-like protein (PhLP), which has 65% amino acid homology to phosducin (12Miles M.F. Barhite S. Sganga M. Elliott M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10831-10835Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We also described several 5′-end splice variants that generate two predicted isoforms of the protein: PhLP long (PhLP) of 301 amino acids containing the entire coding sequence and PhLP short (PhLPS) of 218 amino acids missing the first 83 N-terminal residues of PhLP (12Miles M.F. Barhite S. Sganga M. Elliott M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10831-10835Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 13Wang J.-F. Barhite S. Thibault C. Miles M.F. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1995; 19 (abstr.): 34Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Based on sequence homology with phosducin, we have suggested that PhLP proteins regulate Gβγ signaling in nonretinal tissues. In favor of this hypothesis, a recent report showed that recombinant PhLPS inhibits several Gβγ functionsin vitro (14Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2100-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these authors suggested that unlike phosducin (11Xu J. Wu D. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2086-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Hawes B.E. Touhara K. Kurose H. Lefkowitz R.J. Inglese J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29825-29830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the N terminus of PhLP was unlikely to contain a Gβγ-binding domain. To more directly characterize the interaction of PhLP with Gβγ, we studied PhLP binding to Gβγ both in vivo and in vitro. Our results here, using in vitro binding studies with a series of truncated PhLP/glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, show that PhLP binds βγ through a bipartite binding domain. The Gβγ-PhLP interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of the complex from cell lysates. Our findings support the hypothesis that PhLP can modulate Gβγ function (14Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2100-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) in many tissues through direct protein-protein interactions. Regulation of PhLP/Gβγ interactions could be an important factor in controlling G protein signaling. PhLP and PhLPS cDNAs were cloned in our laboratory (12Miles M.F. Barhite S. Sganga M. Elliott M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10831-10835Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The GST-phosducin construct was obtained from Dr. Cheryl Craft (University of Southern California). Gβγ and Goα proteins purified from bovine brain were kindly provided by Dr. Eva Neer (Brighman and Woman's Hospital, Boston, MA). Gβ1 and Gγ2 expression vectors were kind gifts from Dr. H. Bourne (University of California at San Francisco). Purified recombinant Gβ1γ2 was generously provided by Dr. Rene Onrust in the Bourne laboratory. Recombinant Giα3 protein was from Calbiochem. The full-length PhLP (amino acids 1–301) as well as different regions of the protein corresponding to amino acid residues 84–301 (referred to as PhLPS), 1–167, 1–115, 1–70, 50–167, 84–167, 161–301, and 200–301 were expressed as GST fusion proteins. DNA fragments encoding PhLP and its derivatives were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using rat PhLP cDNA as template and 5′- and 3′-primers containing BamHI andEcoRI sites, respectively. The amplified fragments were ligated in frame with the 3′-end of the coding region of GST intoBamHI and EcoRI sites of the pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The resultant constructs were verified by DNA sequencing using the chain termination method (Sequenase version 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and used to transform Escherichia coli strain BL21. An epitope-tagged PhLP expression vector was generated by fusing an 8 amino acid peptide from the hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus to the C terminus of PhLP. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to the HA epitope (YDVPDYAS), flanked by a 5′EcoRI site and a 3′ NotI site, were synthesized, annealed, and inserted into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) betweenEcoRI and NotI sites. The full-length PhLP coding sequence, amplified as described above, was then ligated between theBamHI and EcoRI sites of the modified pcDNA3 vector, so as to fuse the PhLP C terminus in frame with the 5′-end of the HA tag. Fusion protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thiol-β-d-galactopyranoside for 90 min, and the proteins were solubilized and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Pharmacia) by the Sarkosyl method (16Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Ann. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref Scopus (832) Google Scholar). In a typical binding assay, following immobilization on glutathione-agarose beads, fusion proteins at a final concentration of 0.5–1.0 μm were incubated with 50–100 nmGβγ purified from bovine brain in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.01% Lubrol for 2 h at 4 °C. Following six washes in 200 μl of PBS containing 0.01% Lubrol, the beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and boiled for 10 min. The eluted proteins were separated with 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using standard methods. The blots were probed with a polyclonal anti-β antiserum (1:1000; DuPont NEN) and processed using the enhanced chemiluminescense detection system (Amersham Corp.). Occasionally, blots were stripped and reprobed with a polyclonal anti-GST antiserum (1:4000; Santa Cruz). The entire coding region of PhLPS cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and fused in frame with the maltose binding protein coding region in the vector pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs). The maltose binding protein-PhLPS fusion protein migrated at approximately 72 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as expected. The fusion protein was purified to apparent homogeneity by amylose resin chromatography exactly as described by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs) and was injected into rabbits by a commercial source (CalTag) for generation of a polyclonal antiserum. This antiserum was affinity-purified over a column of GST-PhLPS coupled to CnBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). NG108-15 cells were grown as described (12Miles M.F. Barhite S. Sganga M. Elliott M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10831-10835Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% serum+ (JRH Biosciences). COS-7 cells (3 × 105 cells/well) were seeded 48 h before transfection in 6-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were incubated for 5 h in serum-free DMEM with DNA plasmids premixed with lipofectAmine (Life Technologies, Inc.) and were then incubated overnight at 37 °C in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The total amount of DNA in all transfections was 2 μg/well. When required, the empty pcDNA3 vector was used to maintain a constant amount of DNA. 2 × 106 transfected COS-7 cells or 4 × 106 NG108-15 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). After 15 min of incubation on ice, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the lysate was precleared in the presence of protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz) for 30 min. COS-7 cell lysate was then incubated with 5 μg of monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Boehringer Mannheim) to the HA tag, whereas NG108-15 cell lysate was incubated with 5 μg of affinity-purified polyclonal anti-PhLP or an equivalent amount of preimmune serum. The incubations were conducted overnight at 4 °C before precipitation in the presence of protein A-agarose. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with PBS containing 0.01% Lubrol, and protein complexes were eluted in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot using the 12CA5 antibody and/or a monoclonal antibody to the Gβ1 subunit (Transduction Laboratories). To determine whether PhLP directly interacts with Gβγ, we generated PhLP and PhLPS GST fusion proteins and examined their ability to bind Gβγ purified from bovine brain. Following immobilization of the fusion proteins on glutathione-agarose beads, Gβγ binding was detected by Western blot analysis using an anti-β antiserum. As controls, we tested Gβγ binding by the GST protein itself and GST fused to phosducin (GST-phosducin), a known Gβγ-binding protein. The fusion proteins migrate at their expected molecular weight as visualized by Coomassie Blue-staining (Fig.1 A, lower panel) and can be detected with an anti-GST antibody on Western blot analysis (Fig.1 B, lower panel). In addition, GST-PhLP proteins are recognized by an affinity-purified polyclonal antiserum directed against PhLPS (data not shown). As previously reported by other investigators (11Xu J. Wu D. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2086-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), GST-phosducin bound detectable amounts of Gβγ at a molar ratio of βγ:GST-phosducin of approximately 1:7 (Fig. 1 A, upper panel). Under similar conditions, GST-PhLPS and GST-PhLP also retained Gβγ (Fig. 1 A, upper panel). By contrast, GST protein did not bind Gβγ subunits even when present at a 3-fold higher concentration than the GST-PhLP proteins (Fig.1 A, upper panel), indicating that Gβγ binding by the fusion proteins is specified by the PhLP protein sequence. The affinity of phosducin for Gβγ was previously reported to be in the nanomolar range (11Xu J. Wu D. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2086-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2100-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, GST-PhLP appeared to have a slightly lower affinity for Gβγ than GST-phosducin but of the same order of magnitude because titration with varying amounts of Gβγ protein showed that GST-PhLP retained only slightly lower amounts of Gβγ than did GST-phosducin (Fig.1 B, upper panel). To map the Gβγ binding domain of PhLP, we examined recombinant Gβ1γ2 interaction in vitro with GST fusion proteins containing various regions of PhLP. Fig.2 shows an alignment of PhLP deletion constructs with the full-length PhLP. Each construct produced a protein that migrated at the expected molecular weight on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Surprisingly, we found Gβγ binding activity of PhLP at two areas in the N- and C-terminal regions. In the N-terminal half of PhLP (PhLP1–167), amino acids 50–115 appeared sufficient for Gβγ binding, because PhLP1–115 and PhLP50–167 retained Gβγ, whereas PhLP1–70and PhLP84–167 did not (Fig. 2). The 50–115 region contains an 11-amino acid stretch (57–67: TGPKGVINDWR) that is perfectly conserved between PhLP and phosducin and is known to be essential for Gβγ binding by phosducin (11Xu J. Wu D. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2086-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the crystal structure of the Gt βγ-phosducin complex, reported while this manuscript was in preparation, showed that this highly conserved sequence has extensive and tight interactions with the center of the Gβ propellar (17Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This conserved sequence region of PhLP (amino acids 57–67) may be important for binding of Gβγ because PhLP84–167 totally lacked βγ binding, whereas PhLP50–167 had essentially full binding activity. However, although the 57–67 region may be important for Gβγ binding by PhLP, additional elements seem required because PhLP1–70did not bind Gβγ. Additional deletions revealed that the C-terminal half of PhLP (PhLP161–301) also binds Gβγ. This binding activity was further localized to the C-terminal 101 residues of PhLP (PhLP200–301) (Fig. 2). This C-terminal binding domain may explain why PhLPS (PhLP84–301), which does not contain the 57–67 conserved sequence, still retained significant Gβγ binding activity. The crystal structure of Gt βγ-phosducin also showed two spatially and possibly functionally distinct domains in phosducin (17Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These two domains roughly correspond to the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of the molecule and do not interact with each other but both contact Gβγ. The N-terminal domain may compete with Gα, whereas the C-terminal, thioredoxin-like domain was suggested to be responsible for Gβγ translocation away from the membrane (17Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Based on sequence homology, Gaudet et al. proposed a similar structure for PhLP and predicted the Gβγ interacting residues in this protein (17Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The regions occupied by these amino acids, depicted in Fig. 2, correspond to residues 54–69 and 114–152 in the N-terminal domain and to residues 240–247 and 270–277 in the C-terminal domain. Our results are in perfect agreement with these predictions and also suggest that the N-terminal and C-terminal domains can interact with Gβγ independently. Because these domains may affect different functions of Gβγ, they might be useful tools to study different aspects of Gβγ regulation as suggested by Gaudet et al.(17Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that the binding of Gβγ to Gα subunit inhibits its interaction with phosducin or βARK (15Hawes B.E. Touhara K. Kurose H. Lefkowitz R.J. Inglese J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29825-29830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the N-terminal domain of the G protein-gated K+channel as well as the small GTPase, ADP-ribosylation factor were shown to interact with either Gβγ alone or trimeric Gαβγ (19Huang C.-L. Slesinger P.A. Casey P.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1133-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 20Colombo M.I. Inglese J. D'Souza-Schorey C. Beron W. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24564-24571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We found that recombinant Giα3 inhibited Gβγ binding to GST-PhLP (Fig. 3). Similarly, Goα-GDPβS but not Goα-GTPγS partially abolished the interaction of Gβγ to GST-PhLP (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that only free Gβγ can interact with PhLP. Western blot analysis with a common anti-α antiserum (DuPont NEN) indicated that neither Giα3 or Goα was retained on GST-PhLP along with the Gβγ dimer (Fig. 3 and data not shown). In addition, Giα3 by itself did not bind to GST-PhLP (Fig.3). It should be noted that a relatively high concentration of recombinant Giα3 was required to totally eliminate Gβγ binding to GST-PhLP (Fig. 3). This may reflect the fact that Gβγ interacts more tightly with PhLP than with Gα subunit, as was previously found for phosducin and Gtα interaction with Gβγ (17Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To demonstrate Gβγ-PhLP interaction in vivo, the complex was immunoprecipitated following overexpression of the proteins in COS-7 cells. For these experiments, the C terminus of PhLP was tagged with a HA epitope. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding PhLP-HA, Gβ1 and Gγ2 subunits, or a combination of these proteins. Expression of the proteins in COS-7 cells was monitored by Western blot analysis using monoclonal anti-HA and anti-β1 antibodies (Fig. 4 A, lower panels). PhLP-HA was specifically precipitated by anti-HA antibody (Fig. 4 A, upper panel). In addition, this antibody co-precipitated overexpressed Gβ1γ2 subunits, only in cells co-expressing PhLP-HA (Fig. 4 A, upper panel). We also detected Gβ in immunoprecipitates from cells transfected only with PhLP-HA plasmid (Fig. 4 A, upper panel), suggesting that PhLP-HA interacts with both overexpressed and endogenous Gβγ subunits. Interaction of endogenous PhLP and Gβγ was examined in NG108-15 neuroblastoma × glioma cells because this cell line expresses high basal levels of PhLP. 3C. Thibault and M. F. Miles, unpublished results. Endogenous PhLP protein from NG108-15 cell lysates was immunoprecipitated by an affinity-purified polyclonal antiserum directed against PhLPS. On Western blot analysis of NG108-15 cell lysates, this antiserum recognized a single band migrating at 46 kDa, the expected molecular mass for full-length PhLP protein (data not shown) (12Miles M.F. Barhite S. Sganga M. Elliott M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10831-10835Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The antiserum also immunoprecipitated a 46-kDa protein from [35S]methionine-labeled NG108-15 cells (data not shown). Anti-PhLP immunoprecipitates contained Gβ as detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4 B). Preimmune serum did not precipitate Gβ (Fig. 4 B). These results confirm the overexpression studies (Fig. 4 A) and suggest that PhLP might exist, at least partially, as a complex with Gβγ subunits in vivo. In conclusion, these studies have documented the direct interaction of PhLP with Gβγ through both in vivo and in vitro analyses. Our deletion analysis, together with the recent crystal structure of the phosducin-Gtβγ complex, suggests that two potentially independent domains on PhLP interact with Gβγ. This complements prior studies on PhLP that suggested that regions beyond the N terminus were involved in inhibition of Gβγ function in vitro (14Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2100-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because the two domains of PhLP are predicted to interact with functionally different regions of Gβ (17Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and we have previously shown the existence of multiple forms of the PhLP transcript, it is tempting to speculate that alternate forms of PhLP might produce distinct changes in Gβγ signaling. For example, PhLPS contains predominantly the C-terminal Gβγ-binding domain and thus might produce different kinetics or extent of changes in Gβγ function than the full-length PhLP protein. It remains to be determined which of the diverse Gβγ cellular effects are functionally modified by PhLP-Gβγ interactions. We thank Steven Barhite, Ivan Diamond, Ulrike Heberlein, and Robert Messing at the Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center for many helpful discussions during the course of these studies. We also thank Henry Bourne, Cheryl Craft, Eva Neer, and Rene Onrust for gifts of proteins and plasmids as noted under “Experimental Procedures.”"
https://openalex.org/W1989789530,"Mammalian adenylyl cyclases have t2wo homologous cytoplasmic domains (C1 and C2), and both domains are required for the high enzymatic activity. Mutational and genetic analyses of type I and soluble adenylyl cyclases suggest that the C2 domain is catalytically active and the C1 domain is not; the role of the C1 domain is to promote the catalytic activity of the C2 domain. Two amino acid residues, Asn-1025 and Arg-1029 of type II adenylyl cyclase, are conserved among the C2 domains, but not among the C1 domains, of adenylyl cyclases with 12 putative transmembrane helices. Mutations at each amino acid residue alone result in a 30–100-fold reduction in Kcat of adenylyl cyclase. However, the same mutations do not affect theKm for ATP, the half-maximal concentration (EC50) for the C2 domain of type II adenylyl cyclase to associate with the C1 domain of type I adenylyl cyclase and achieve maximal enzyme activity, or the EC50for forskolin to maximally activate enzyme activity with or without Gsα. This indicates that the mutations at these two residues do not cause gross structural alteration. Thus, these two conserved amino acid residues appear to be crucial for catalysis, and their absence from the C1 domains may account for its lack of catalytic activity. Mutations at both amino acid residues together result in a 3,000-fold reduction in Kcat of adenylyl cyclase, suggesting that these two residues have additive effects in catalysis. A second site suppressor of the Asn-1025 to Ser mutant protein has been isolated. This suppressor has 17-fold higher activity than the mutant and has a Pro-1015 to Ser mutation. Mammalian adenylyl cyclases have t2wo homologous cytoplasmic domains (C1 and C2), and both domains are required for the high enzymatic activity. Mutational and genetic analyses of type I and soluble adenylyl cyclases suggest that the C2 domain is catalytically active and the C1 domain is not; the role of the C1 domain is to promote the catalytic activity of the C2 domain. Two amino acid residues, Asn-1025 and Arg-1029 of type II adenylyl cyclase, are conserved among the C2 domains, but not among the C1 domains, of adenylyl cyclases with 12 putative transmembrane helices.

However, the same mutations do not affect theKm for ATP, the half-maximal concentration (EC50) for the C2 domain of type II adenylyl cyclase to associate with the C1 domain of type I adenylyl cyclase and achieve maximal enzyme activity, or the EC50for forskolin to maximally activate enzyme activity with or without Gsα. This indicates that the mutations at these two residues do not cause gross structural alteration. Thus, these two conserved amino acid residues appear to be crucial for catalysis, and their absence from the C1 domains may account for its lack of catalytic activity. Mutations at both amino acid residues together result in a 3,000-fold reduction in Kcat of adenylyl cyclase, suggesting that these two residues have additive effects in catalysis. A second site suppressor of the Asn-1025 to Ser mutant protein has been isolated. This suppressor has 17-fold higher activity than the mutant and has a Pro-1015 to Ser mutation. The activity of mammalian adenylyl cyclase, the enzyme that converts ATP to cAMP, is the key step in modulating intracellular cAMP concentration in response to extracellular stimulation by hormones, neurotransmitters, and odorants. Nine isoforms of mammalian adenylyl cyclases have been cloned to date, and they belong to a rapid expanding cyclase family that includes class III adenylyl cyclases 1Three classes of adenylyl cyclases have been cloned based on the conservation of their catalytic domains: class I, adenylyl cyclases from Enterobacteria including E. coli; class II, toxin-adenylyl cyclases including calmodulin activated toxins from Bordetella pertussis and Bacillus anthracis; and class III, adenylyl cyclases homologous from bacteria to human (1Tang, W.-J., Yan, S.-Z., and Drum, C. (1997) Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res., in press.Google Scholar). Class III adenylyl cyclases have four distinct molecular designs. First are the integral membrane proteins that contain two hydrophobic stretches (∼20 kDa each), each consisting of six putative transmembrane helices and two homologous cytoplasmic domains (C1 and C2 domains, 30–40 kDa each). This design includes nine mammalian adenylyl cyclases (type I to type IX), fruit fly rutabaga (Dm rutabaga), and slime mold (Dd ACA) (22Krupinski J. Coussen F. Bakalyar H.A. Tang W.J. Feinstein P.G.

Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res., in press.Google Scholar). All nine isoforms have a similar structure, including two intensely hydrophobic domains (M1 and M2) and two 40-kDa cytoplasmic domains (C1 and C2). The two cytoplasmic domains contain sequences (C1a and C2a) that are homologous to each other and to class III adenylyl cyclases and guanylyl cyclases. Each isoform of adenylyl cyclase not only has distinct patterns of tissue expression but also has unique responses to extracellular and intracellular stimuli (1Tang, W.-J., Yan, S.-Z., and Drum, C.

In common, each adenylyl cyclase can be activated by the G protein 2The abbreviations used are: G protein, guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein; Gsα, the α subunit of the G protein that stimulates adenylyl cyclase; Fsk, forskolin; IC1 protein, C1 domain of type I adenylyl cyclase; IIC2 protein, C2 domain of type II adenylyl cyclase; GTPγS, guanosine-5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate; aa, amino acid(s); 2′-d-3′-AMP, 2′deoxyadenosine 3′-monophosphate; kbp, kilobase pair; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; LB, Luria broth; CMV, cytomegalovirus; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine. α subunit, designated as Gsα, and each can be inhibited by certain adenosine analogues (P-site inhibitors). However, there are several subtype-specific regulators, including forskolin, G protein βγ subunits, the α subunit of Gi, Go, and Gz, Ca2+ ion, Ca2+-calmodulin, Ca2+-calcineurin, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and PKC (for review, see Refs. 1Tang, W.-J., Yan, S.-Z., and Drum, C.

Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Certain ones of these regulators (e.g. βγ) can be either stimulatory or inhibitory, depending on the subtype of adenylyl cyclase (4Tang W.-J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). When acting concurrently, the effects of regulators can be independent or interdependent (antagonistic or synergistic). The binding sites of adenylyl cyclases for Ca2+-calmodulin and G protein βγ subunits are in the C1 and C2domains, respectively (5Chen J. Devivo M. Dingus J. Harry A. Li J. Sui J. Carty D.J.

The sites for other regulators and the mechanisms by which they modulate activity of adenylyl cyclase remain to be determined. One key step in studying the mechanisms for the complicated regulation of adenylyl cyclase is to understand the molecular basis of catalysis. The Gsα- and forskolin-stimulated soluble adenylyl cyclases can be formed either by mixing IC1 protein (C1 domain of type I adenylyl cyclase) and IIC2protein (C2 domain of type II adenylyl cyclase) in vitro or by covalent linkage of IC1 and IIC2 proteins (IC1IIC2) (9Yan S.-Z.

From the genetic and biochemical analysis of this soluble adenylyl cyclase and mutational analysis of type I enzyme, we have shown that both C1 and C2 domains are required for the high enzymatic activity (13Tang W.-J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the data suggests that the C2 domain is the catalytic domain while the C1domain enhances the activity of the C2 domain. In this paper, genetic and biochemical analyses are used to identify two amino acid residues, asparagine and arginine that are crucial for catalysis and might play an important role in inactivating the enzymatic activity of the C1 domain. Forskolin was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA); 2′-d-3′-AMP was from Sigma; restriction enzymes and Vent DNA polymerase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA); Bradford reagent was from Bio-Rad; ECL system was from Amersham Corp.; Ni-NTA resin was from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA); and Escherichia coliXL1-red cells were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). GTPγS was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. and purified by FPLC Mono Q column chromatography. E. coli strain, WJT-1 (Δcya AraD - endoA crp/crp 3crp/crp andmalT/malT mean that the strain is diploid for two genes due to presence of the F141 plasmid (15Low B. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 587-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in E. coli to resistance to λ phage infection can arise from chromosomal mutations, most frequently in one of three genes,malT, lamB, or crp. To reduce the frequency of two of such undesired mutations, strain WJT-1 was made diploid for the malT and the crp genes. Since strains diploid for both matT and crp genes had to have mutations on both copies of either of these genes to survive infection by λvir, the frequency of resistance was much lower in diploids than in strains with only one copy of the gene. malT/malT 3) was constructed so that cAMP synthesis by the cloned cyclase replaced such synthesis by the bacteria gene and that made it possible to enrich for mutations that decreased synthesis of cAMP. To construct E. coli WJT-1 cells, E. coli TK2313 (F- thi rha lacZ nagA Δ(kdpAE81) trk1 trkA405 endoA) was transduced with P1 lysate of a thr34::Tn10 strain, and a tetracycline-resistant colony was purified. This strain was then transduced to Thr +, araD139 with a lysate of strain MC4100 (14Casadaban M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 541-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). One araD139 derivative of TK2313 was purified and transduced toilv500::Tn10 with a lysate of strain MRi134 (pertinent marker isilv500::Tn10), and a tetracycline-resistent colony was purified. The resulting strain was transduced to ilv +, Δcya with a lysate of strain TK2648 (pertinent marker Δ(cya)8306, a deletion originally obtained from J. Beckwith (Harvard Medical School) in strain CA8306), and a Δcya transductant was purified. Finally, the F141 plasmid that carried the crp malT TrkAgenes was introduced by selection for growth on medium containing 0.1 mm K+ (15Low B. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 587-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two conditions were used to select the loss of function IC1IIC2 mutants in which expression of cAMP-dependent genes was growth inhibitory or lethal. The first was the sensitivity of E. coli to infection and killing by λ phage, and the second was its inhibition of growth by a metabolic intermediate of arabinose catabolism. A library of plasmids that had mutations at the coding region of IC1IIC2 was constructed by propagating plasmid pProEx-HAH6-IC1IIC2 in E. colimutator strain, XL-1 red (mutD5 mutS mutT). Plasmid DNAs were isolated and transformed into WJT-1 cells that harbored pBB131-GsαQ227L [WJT-1 (GsαQ227L)]. The transformants were grown in Luria broth (LB) that contained 0.2% maltose and supplement A (2 mm KCl, 5 mmMgSO4, 100 μm IPTG, 25 μmampicillin, and 50 μm kanamycin) overnight. The transformants (107 cells) were then infected with λ phage, λvir (1010 plaque-forming units) in LB medium that contained 1% maltose and supplement A for 1 h, and then plated on LB plates that contained 1% maltose, 1% arabinose, and supplement A. Plasmid DNAs from the resulting colonies were isolated and transformed into WJT-1 (GsαQ227L). The resulting cells were tested on MacConkey plates (MacConkey agar base, Difco) that contained 1% maltose and supplement A. The coding sequences for IC1IIC2 of the mutated DNAs from colonies that were negative on maltose-MacConkey plates were then excised byEcoRI and HindIII from plasmids encoding the mutants and cloned into pProEx-HAH6 that had been digested with the same enzymes. The DNAs that were transformed into strain WJT-1 cells and were again negative on maltose-MacConkey plates were analyzed further for expression and enzymatic activity of IC1IIC2. Double-stranded DNA sequencing of the coding region of IC1IIC2 mutants was performed to identify the mutations. The second site suppressors from IC1IIC2-N1025S mutants were obtained from E. coli that grew faster than the control (E. coli that express both IC1IIC2-N1025S and GsαQ227L) on maltose-minimal medium. To increase the sensitivity of cAMP detection,E. coli WJT-3 cells (Δcya cpdB −) were constructed by transducing E. coli Crookes strain (cpdB −) to Δcya by the protocol used to put this mutation into WJT-1 cells (16Fraser A.D.E. Yamazaki H. Can. J. Microbiol. 1978; 24: 1423-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The procedures in analyzing the second site suppressors were similar to that in analyzing the loss of function mutants of IC1IIC2proteins. To construct pProEx-HAH6-IIC2-M16 or pProEx-HAH6-IIC2-N1025S(TCG), 0.8 kbp of DNA was amplified by 15 cycles of polymerase chain reaction using pProEx-HAH6-IC1IIC2-M16 or pProEx-HAH6-IC1IIC2-N1025S(TCG) as the template, respectively, Vent DNA polymerase, and two oligonucleotides (5′-CGAGGAATTCTGGAGAACGTGCTTCCTGCACAC and 5′-TGCGTTCTGATTTAATCTGTATCAGGCTGA) as the primers. 4IIC2 here is the same as IIC2-Δ3 described previously (9Yan S.-Z. Hahn D. Huang Z.-H. Tang W.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10941-10945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The resulting DNAs were digested with EcoRI and HindIII and ligated into pProEx-HAH6 that had been digested with the same enzymes. The resulting constructs were confirmed by dideoxy nucleotide sequencing. Kunkle's method (17Kunkle T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar) was used to incorporate the desired point mutations into the phagemid vectors, pProEx-HAH6-IIC2 and pProEx-HAH6-IIC2-M16 (N1025S). Oligonucleotides (23-mer) used for mutagenesis contained 10 complementary nucleotides flanking each side of the target codon, which was replaced with the appropriate codon for the mutants that had single point mutation (N1025S, N1025A, N1025D, N1025K, N1025Q, N1025T, and R1029A) or double point mutations (IIC2-P1015S, N1025S; P1015A,N1025S; P1015D,N1025S; P1015E,N1025S; P1015N,N1025S; and P1015Q,N1025S). Mutations were confirmed by dideoxy nucleotide sequencing of the plasmid DNA. To construct pRC/CMV-ACII N1025K, the 0.7-kbp DNA was isolated from pProEx-HAH6-IIC2-N1025K that was digested with restriction enzymes, BspEI and XbaI, and cloned into pSK-ACII that had been digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was then digested with HindIII and XbaI, and the 3.3-kbp DNA, which encoded type II adenylyl cyclase, was excised and ligated to pRC/CMV that had been digested with HindIII andXbaI. The same approach was used to construct pRC/CMV-ACII for expression of type II adenylyl cyclase. The plasmids that encoded wild type or mutant forms of IIC2 were transformed into E. coliBL21(DE3) cells. E. coli that harbored the desired plasmid were cultured in LB medium containing 50 mg/ml ampicillin at 30 °C. When A600 reached 0.4, IPTG (100 μm) was added. After 3–4 h, the induced cells were then collected and lysed, and IIC2 proteins were purified using the Ni-NTA column and FPLC Q-Sepharose column as described (9Yan S.-Z. Hahn D. Huang Z.-H. Tang W.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10941-10945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to determine the protein peak in the fractions from the Q-Sepharose column. The concentration of proteins was determined using Bradford reagent and bovine serum albumin as standard (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Mouse adrenal Y1-t4 cells (kindly provided by Dr. E. Simpson, Univ. of Texas Southwestern Medical School) were selected for their high sensitivity to morphological changes upon cAMP stimulation. HEK 293 and mouse adrenal Y1-t4 cells (106/60-mm dish) were transfected with pRC/CMV, PRC/CMV-ACII, or pRC/CMV-ACII-N1025K by lipofection (Life Technologies, Inc). Geneticin (0.5 mg/ml) was used to select HEK 293 and mouse adrenal Y1-t4 cells that had stably incorporated the expression constructs, and cell colonies surviving antibiotic selection from a single transfection were pooled into a polyclonal population for subsequent analysis. Activities of the soluble adenylyl cyclases were assayed for 20 min at 30 °C in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 (19Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 58: 541-548Crossref Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Wild-type IIC2 and IIC2 mutant proteins were premixed with IC1 on ice for 10 min before the assay. Recombinant Gsα was purified and activated by GTPγS as described (20Tang W.-J. Krupinski J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8595-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Plasma membranes from the pools of HEK 293 and mouse adrenal Y1-t4 stable transformants were isolated as described (22Krupinski J. Coussen F. Bakalyar H.A. Tang W.J. Feinstein P.G. Orth K. Reed R.R. Gilman A.G. Science. 1989; 244: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity of the membrane fractions was assayed for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 30 μmAlCl3, 10 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm NaF(AMF) or 100 μm forskolin (Fsk). We have shown that coexpression of IC1IIC2 and constitutively active Gsα, GsαQ227L can complement the genetic defects of E. coli Δcya, which has a deletion of the adenylyl cyclase gene and thus fails to synthesize cAMP (10Tang W.-J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1995; 268: 1769-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To select IC1IIC2 mutants that have reduced adenylyl cyclase activity (loss of function mutants), we have constructed an E. coli strain, WJT-1 (Δcya AraD - endoA crp/crp 3 malT/malT 3). Two conditions were used to select the loss of function IC1IIC2 mutants in which expression of cAMP-dependent genes was growth inhibitory or lethal. The first was the sensitivity of E. coli to infection by λ phage. A virulent mutant of bacteriophage λ (λvir) kills E. coli. Absorption of λ to the cell begins with binding to the LamB protein. Expression of LamB protein is induced when E. coli is grown with medium containing maltose, and expression of the LamB is dependent on cAMP. Thus, strains that express the maltose genes are killed by λvir. Mutants that do not express a functional LamB protein do not absorb λ phage and thus survive. Therefore, selection for resistance to λvir enriches for mutants unable to make cAMP. As expected, most of WJT-1 cells (>99.9%) that expressed both IC1IIC2 and GsαQ227L were sensitive to infection by λvir (plaques were opaque), while those that expressed IC1IIC2 or GsαQ227L alone were insensitive to infection (data not shown). The second condition for selection of loss of function mutants was the growth inhibition of E. coli by a metabolic intermediate of arabinose catabolism. Arabinose induces the enzymes specific to early steps of arabinose catabolism. When ribulose-1-phosphate epimerase is defective, the product produced by the araD gene, ribulose-1-phosphate, accumulates in the cell. This sugar phosphate, like many others, is growth inhibitory when accumulated to high levels. Since expression of the genes for arabinose catabolism is also dependent on cAMP, araD mutants that make cAMP are inhibited by arabinose, while those that do not make cAMP are not. E. coli WJT-1 strain was AraD −, and thus 90% of WJT-1 cells that expressed IC1IIC2 and GsαQ227L were growth-arrested when arabinose was added (both in minimal and complex media). As a control, arabinose had no effect on the growth of WJT-1 cells that expressed either IC1IIC2 or GsαQ227L alone. The combination of selection by λvir and arabinose provided 104-fold enrichment of WTJ-1 cells that failed to produce high concentrations of intracellular cAMP (Fig.1 A). The first step in selecting IC1IIC2 mutants that failed to be activated by GsαQ227L in vivo was random mutagenesis of the plasmid containing the coding region of IC1IIC2 by growth in mutator strain XL-1 red (mutT mutD mutS). This strain can introduce a variety of mutations, including transitions, transversions, and frameshifts. The cells that failed to produce cAMP were selected based on their insensitivity to infection by λvir and to growth inhibition by arabinose. Approximately 20-fold higher numbers of colonies of WJT-1 cells that carried the mutagenized plasmids (pProEx-HAH6-IC1IIC2) were observed than those that carried the unmutagenized pProEx-HAH6-IC1IIC2, indicating that this selection did enrich for the loss of function mutants. Thirty clones were selected for analysis. The coding regions for IC1IIC2 of 30 colonies were introduced back to unmutated pProEx-HAH6, and they were analyzed genetically (phenotype on maltose-MacConkey medium) and biochemically (immunoblot and adenylyl cyclase activity). Two IC1IIC2 mutants (M8 and M16) were of interest. WJT-1 cells that carried either IC1IIC2-M8 or M16 were insensitive to infection by λvir and growth arrest by arabinose and were delayed in being positive on maltose-MacConkey medium (Fig. 1 A). Lysates from BL21(DE3) cells that expressed IC1IIC2-M8 and M16 mutants had normal expression of 60 kDa IC1IIC2, but they had a significant reduction (4- and 95-fold, respectively) in Gsα- and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (Fig. 1, Aand B). IC1IIC2-M8 had a relatively conserved leucine to phenylalanine change at aa 362 of type I adenylyl cyclase (CTC→TTC) (Fig. 2). IC1IIC2-M16 has two transitions, resulting in the change of a highly conserved asparagine to serine at aa 1025 (AAC→AGC) and a silent mutation at aa 832 (TTG→TTA) of type II adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 2). Three IC1IIC2 mutants had 2–5-fold reduction in expression of 60 kDa proteins that were correlated well with reduced adenylyl cyclase activity (data not shown). Immunoblot showed that all three mutants had increased amounts of smaller molecular weight immunoreactive bands, suggesting that the reduced protein expression was associated with increased proteolysis (not shown). Sequence analysis of one of these mutants (M25) showed that IC1IIC2-M25 had a glutamine to lysine change at aa 848 of type II adenylyl cyclase (GAG→AAG). We have shown that the region from aa 821 to aa 855 of type II adenylyl cyclase is not required for catalysis (9Yan S.-Z. Hahn D. Huang Z.-H. Tang W.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10941-10945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mutation at aa 848 is likely to cause a structural change that renders IC1IIC2 highly susceptible to proteolysis. Although WJT-1 cells that carried the plasmids for the remaining 25 IC1IIC2 mutants did take longer to be positive on maltose-MacConkey, E. coli lysates of these mutants did not have a significant reduction in enzyme activity. Thus, they were not analyzed further. Genetic and mutational analyses suggest that the C2 domain of mammalian adenylyl cyclase is the catalytic domain, and the C1 domain is not (10Tang W.-J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1995; 268: 1769-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Tang W.-J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This begs the questions as to which amino acids are crucial for catalytic activity of the C2 domains, and are they absent at the C1domains? More than 30 different adenylyl cyclases and guanylyl cyclases share the common homologous cytoplasmic domains, designated as the cyclase domains (1Tang, W.-J., Yan, S.-Z., and Drum, C. (1997) Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res., in press.Google Scholar). For the functional enzyme, the cyclase domains can work as the homo-oligomer, such as adenylyl cyclases from yeast,Trypanosome, Dictyostelium (ACG),Leishmania, Brevibacterium, andRhizobium (23Pitt G.S.

In this study, we have used the baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cell system to express and characterize the five dissimilar subunits of rat eIF-2B. GEF activity was detected in extracts of Sf9 cells expressing the ε-subunit alone and was greatly increased when all five subunits were coexpressed. In addition, high GEF activity was observed in extracts containing a four-subunit complex lacking the α-subunit. Assembly of an eIF-2B holoprotein was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of all five subunits. Gel filtration chromatography revealed that recombinant eIF-2B had the same molecular mass as eIF-2B purified from rat liver and that it did indeed possess GEF activity. Phosphorylation of the substrate eIF-2 inhibited the GEF activity of the five-subunit eIF-2B; this inhibition required the eIF-2B α-subunit. The results demonstrate that eIF-2Bα functions as a regulatory subunit that is not required for GEF activity, but instead mediates the regulation of eIF-2B by substrate phosphorylation. Furthermore, eIF-2Bε is necessary and is perhaps sufficient for GEF activity in vitro.

Protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells is regulated in response to growth factors, hormones, and changes in the external environment (reviewed in Refs. 1Kimball S.R. Vary T.C. Jefferson L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 321-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar and 2Redpath N.T. Proud C.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1220: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). One of the major control points for protein synthesis is the initiation of mRNA translation, which is mediated by a number of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) 1The abbreviations used are: eIFs, eukaryotic initiation factors; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Ac NPV, A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus; HCR, heme-controlled repressor. (recently reviewed in Ref. 3Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Translation of mRNA begins with the binding of initiator Met-tRNAi to the 40 S ribosomal subunit and is mediated by eIF-2 as part of the eIF-2·GTP·Met-tRNAi ternary complex. During the initiation process, the GTP bound to eIF-2 is hydrolyzed, and a binary complex consisting of eIF-2 and GDP is released from the 80 S initiation complex. Since eIF-2 has a 100–400-fold higher affinity for GDP than for GTP, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) known as eIF-2B is required to regenerate the GTP-bound form of eIF-2, which can then participate in another cycle of translation initiation. In cells subjected to a variety of stresses, e.g. heat shock, serum and amino acid deprivation, and heme deprivation in reticulocytes, protein synthesis is inhibited by a mechanism involving phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eIF-2 (reviewed in Ref. 4Clemens M.J. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1996: 139-172Google Scholar). Phosphorylated eIF-2 efficiently binds to eIF-2B, but cannot undergo nucleotide exchange and therefore competitively inhibits the GEF function of eIF-2B, which is present in limiting amounts in all cell types examined (5Rhoads R.E.

In addition, eIF-2B may be regulated by other mechanisms since its activity is modulated under certain conditions in the absence of a change in phosphorylation of eIF-2α (8Welsh G.I. Proud C.G.

The ε-subunit of eIF-2B is phosphorylated in vitro by glycogen synthase kinase-3, casein kinase-1, and casein kinase-2, which may alter the GEF activity of the holoprotein (13Singh L.P. Denslow N.D. Wahba A.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 35: 3206-3212Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14Dholakia J.N. Wahba A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, the activity of eIF-2B appears to be regulated by allosteric effectors,e.g. NADP+, NAD+, and ATP inhibit guanine nucleotide exchange, whereas NADPH, NADH, and polyamines activate exchange (17Dholakia J.N.

Most GEFs, such as those stimulating GDP dissociation from the Ras superfamily of proteins, exist as single subunit proteins (21Overbeck A.F. Brtva T.R. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Huff S.Y. Khosravi-Far R.

Bioessays. 1995; 17: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In contrast, eIF-2B is a complex protein consisting of five dissimilar subunits. The cDNAs for all five subunits of eIF-2B have been cloned from both mammals (23Price N.T. Mellor H. Craddock B.L. Flowers K.M. Kimball S.R. Wilmer T. Jefferson L.S. Proud C.G. Biochem.

Alignment of the coding regions of mammalian and yeast subunits indicates sequence homology for the mammalian α-, β-, γ-, δ-, and ε-subunits with the yeast GCN3, GCD7, GCD1, GCD2, and GCD6 subunits, respectively. Genetic studies in yeast indicate that deletion of the α-subunit of eIF-2B (GCN3) does not affect viability and therefore is not an essential component of the GCD complex under normal growth conditions (28Hannig E.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4808-4820Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, there is controversy over the requirement of the α-subunit for eIF-2B function since a recent report has suggested that purified rabbit eIF-2B lacking the α-subunit does not have GEF activity (29Craddock B.L. Proud C.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 220: 843-847Google Scholar). The current model for translation initiation in eukaryotic cells is formulated from biochemical studies of cell-free systems derived from rabbit reticulocytes and from genetic experiments conducted in yeast. In the study reported here, we set out to determine if the baculovirus expression system could be used as a new approach to study the structure/function relationship of translation initiation factors, many of which are composed of multiple subunits with unknown functions. For example, despite the fact that the mammalian eIF-2B complex has been available in purified form for 15 years and all five yeast and mammalian eIF-2B subunits have now been cloned, relatively little is known about the function of individual subunits or the mechanism of nucleotide exchange. Here we report our studies on the expression and coexpression of rat eIF-2B subunits in Sf9 insect cells using recombinant baculoviruses and the characterization of GEF activity in extracts of cells expressing these proteins. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the γ- and ε-subunits of eIF-2B were produced using purified protein for antigen as described previously (30Kimball S.R. Karinch A.M. Feldhoff R.C. Mellor H. Jefferson L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, a monoclonal antibody against the γ-subunit of eIF-2B was used in conjunction with a rabbit anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems) to detect the eIF-2B γ-subunit and the α-, β-, δ-, and ε-subunits of eIF-2B harboring an amino-terminal FLAG marker octapeptide (DYKDDDDK), respectively. The full-length clone for the rat eIF-2Bβ (GenBankTM/EMBL accession number U83914) used in this study was obtained by screening the Stratagene rat brain Uni ZAPXR cDNA library (catalogue number 936515) using the rabbit eIF-2Bβ cDNA (31Craddock B.L. Price N.T. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) as a probe (kindly provided by Dr. C. G. Proud, University of Kent, Canterbury, United Kingdom). The complementary DNA clones encoding rat eIF-2B α-, γ-, δ-, and ε-subunits were previously described (23Price N.T. Mellor H. Craddock B.L. Flowers K.M. Kimball S.R. Wilmer T. Jefferson L.S.

Acta. 1996; 1307: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and their GenBank™/EMBL accession numbers are U05821,Z48225, U38253, and U19511, respectively. To facilitate identification and quantitation of rat eIF-2B subunits in Sf9 cells, sequences encoding a common 8-amino acid FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) were added to the cDNAs encoding the α-, β-, δ-, and ε-subunits by polymerase chain reaction using the PfuDNA polymerase (Stratagene). The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into the SrfI site of the plasmid pCR-Script Cam SK(+) according to instructions supplied by the manufacturer (Stratagene). The eIF-2Bγ cDNA had an internal BamHI site that was removed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The primers used to remove the BamHI site resulted in a single nucleotide substitution that did not alter the amino acid sequence of the protein. The identities of all clones were confirmed by sequence analysis of the 5′- and 3′-regions using the reverse primer and T7 primers, which bind to the polylinker region of the pCR-Script plasmid. The full-length eIF-2Bα, eIF-2Bβ, eIF-2Bγ, and eIF-2Bδ cDNAs were next subcloned out of the pCR-Script plasmid and into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcUW51 (Pharmingen) containing the baculovirus p10 and polyhedrin promoters. Specifically, the cDNAs for the α- and δ-subunits containing the FLAG epitope were sequentially subcloned into the BamHI and BglII sites, respectively, of pAcUW51. The cDNAs for the γ- and δ-subunits were sequentially subcloned into theBamHI and BglII sites, respectively, of pAcUW51. A baculovirus transfer vector encoding the FLAG-tagged eIF-2Bε cDNA was constructed by isolating anNcoI/Acc65I fragment encoding the full-length cDNA fragment from pCR-Script and then ligating the fragment into the corresponding sites downstream of the polyhedrin promoter of the pAcSG2 transfer vector (Pharmingen). A baculovirus transfer vector that expressed the FLAG-tagged δ-subunit alone was constructed by subcloning the eIF-2Bδ cDNA into the BglII site of pAcUW51. Sf9 insect cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL-1711) were placed in culture using Grace's insect medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 0.1% Pluronic F-68, 2 mm glutamine, and 20 μg/ml gentamicin. To generate recombinant baculoviruses expressing the combinations of eIF-2B subunits described above, BaculoGold Autographa californicanuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA (BaculoGold AcNPV, Pharmingen) and each of the recombinant transfer vectors were cotransfected into Sf9 cells, and recombinant baculoviruses were isolated by plaque purification as described previously (32Richardson, C. D., Baculovirus Expression Protocols, 39, 1995, Humana Press, Totowa, NJ.sGoogle Scholar). Recombinant plaques expressing eIF-2B subunits were identified by infecting 2 × 106 cells with the plaque supernatant. Cell lysates were prepared 72 h later and screened for protein production by immunoblot analysis. For expression of eIF-2B subunits, 6 × 106 Sf9 insect cells were plated in 100-mm dishes. The Sf9 cells were then infected with recombinant baculovirus(es) at a multiplicity of infection of 10 in a reduced volume of 3.0 ml for 1 h, fed with 11 ml of medium, and then lysed at 60 h post-infection. As a control, Sf9 insect cells were also infected with wild-type AcNPV baculovirus. For immunoprecipitation assays, 6 × 106 infected cells were washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 700 μl of lysis buffer consisting of 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 unit/ml aprotinin, and 20 mm leupeptin. Cells were vortexed in lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 15 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 16,000 × g. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed by incubating lysates with 250 μl of a monoclonal antibody against eIF-2Bε at 4 °C overnight. Goat anti-mouse Biomag IgG beads (PerSeptive Diagnostics) were used to collect the antigen-antibody complexes. Prior to use, the beads were washed in 1% nonfat dry milk in Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.04% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaF, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.5 mm sodium vanadate) containing 150 mm NaCl. The beads were then captured using a magnetic stand and washed twice with Buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl and once with Buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl. Protein bound to the beads was eluted in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer, and the sample was incubated at 100 °C for 5 min. The beads were collected by centrifugation, and proteins in the sample were separated by electrophoresis as described below. Immunoprecipitates of cell lysates prepared as described above were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and were electrophoretically transferred to 0.2-μm pore size nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V) in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, for 1 h; washed in TBST (Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, containing 0.2% Tween 20); and probed overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody diluted in TBST. The rabbit and mouse anti-FLAG antibodies were diluted 1:2500 (0.04 μg/ml final concentration) and 1:2000 (1.5 μg/ml final concentration), respectively. The filters were then washed in TBST, probed for 1 h with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Amersham Corp.) diluted 1:20,000 in TBST, washed again in TBST, and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). To detect the eIF-2B γ-subunit, the blots were reprobed with a monoclonal antibody against rat eIF-2Bγ diluted 1:100, reprobed with secondary antibody, and developed as described above. Infected Sf9 cells (6 × 106) were washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1.0 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer (45 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.375 mm magnesium acetate, 0.075 mm EDTA, 95 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mg/ml digitonin, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were immediately assayed for eIF-2B activity as determined by the exchange of [3H]GDP bound to eIF-2 for unlabeled GDP as described previously (33Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16794-16798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The labeled binary complex eIF-2·[3H]GDP was prepared by incubating tubes containing rat liver eIF-2 (∼95% pure (34Kimball S.R. Everson W.V. Myers L.M. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2220-2227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and [3H]GDP (2.5 mm, 10.9 Ci/mmol) in 80 μl of assay buffer (62.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 125 mm KCl, 1.25 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 30 °C for 10 min. The Mg2+ concentration was adjusted to 2 mm, and the binary complex was stored on ice before use. To measure eIF-2B activity, assay buffer containing a 100-fold excess of GDP, 1.25–40 μl of cell lysate, and 2 mmMg2+ was added to a tube, followed by 1–2 pmol of labeled binary complex. The mixture was then incubated at 30 °C for 0, 2, 4, or 6 min. The exchange reaction was measured as a decrease in the eIF-2-mediated binding of [3H]GDP to nitrocellulose filters with time. For the experiments shown in Fig. 6, eIF-2 was phosphorylated using the eIF-2α kinase HCR by incubating 7.5 μg of pure eIF-2 in 37.5 μl of HCR kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm magnesium chloride, and 0.1 mm ATP) with 7.5 μl (∼0.5 μg) of purified rabbit reticulocyte HCR (35Kimball S.R. Antonetti D.A. Brawley R.M. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1969-1976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was terminated by placing the tube on ice. An equal volume of kinase assay buffer containing the phosphatase inhibitors NaF (100 μm final concentration) and microcystin (2 μm final concentration) was added to each tube. A similar reaction containing eIF-2 without HCR was processed identically for use as the unphosphorylated eIF-2 control. The phosphorylation state of eIF-2α was monitored by isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis. To measure eIF-2B activity, assay buffer containing phosphorylated or unphosphorylated eIF-2, a 100-fold excess of GDP, 1.25–40 μl of cell lysate, and 2 mm Mg2+ was added to a plastic tube and incubated at 30 °C for 2 min. The eIF-2·[3H]GDP complex (1–2 pmol) was then added to each tube, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed from the tubes at 0, 2, 4, or 6 min and filtered through nitrocellulose filters as described above. Infected Sf9 cells (6 × 106) were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 0.25 ml of ice-cold buffer consisting of 45 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.375 mmmagnesium acetate, 0.075 mm EDTA, 95 mmpotassium acetate, 2.5 mg/ml digitonin, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C and loaded onto a Superose 6 gel filtration column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) pre-equilibrated with buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 150 mmKCl. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and the absorbance at 280 nm was measured. Aliquots (0.02 ml) of each fraction containing protein were assayed for GEF activity as described above. To confirm the presence of eIF-2B subunits in fractions, 25 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer were added to 25-μl aliquots of each fraction, and 15 μl of the mixture were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG and anti-eIF-2Bγ antibodies as described above. To facilitate detection, a common epitope consisting of the FLAG octapeptide (DYKDDDDK) was added to the N terminus of the eIF-2B α-, β-, δ-, and ε-subunits. Recombinant baculoviruses for each of the FLAG-tagged eIF-2B subunits were constructed so as to express the individual subunit cDNAs under the control of either the polyhedrin promoter or the p10 promoter. To reduce the number of baculoviruses needed to express all five subunits of eIF-2B in Sf9 cells, single baculoviruses encoding either the α- and δ- or β- and γ-subunits were generated using a transfer vector designed for multigene expression. Expression of the largest eIF-2B subunit (eIF-2Bε) was achieved using a transfer vector designed for single gene expression. To investigate the relative expression/coexpression of eIF-2B subunits, Sf9 cells were (i) singly infected with baculoviruses encoding individual eIF-2B subunits or (ii) triply infected with baculoviruses encoding all five eIF-2B subunits. The recombinant eIF-2B proteins expressed in Sf9 cells 60 h post-infection were resolved by SDS-PAGE and identified by immunoblot analysis using anti-FLAG and anti-eIF-2Bγ monoclonal antibodies. Similar amounts of expressed eIF-2B α-, β-, δ-, and ε-subunit proteins were observed for Sf9 cells singly infected with baculoviruses encoding the ε-subunit (Fig.1 A, lane 1), the α- and δ-subunits (lane 2), and the β- and γ-subunits (lane 3). For Sf9 cells infected with all three viruses, coexpression of proteins for each of the five eIF-2B subunits was observed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). However, in these experiments, the amount of eIF-2Bγ produced could not be directly compared with the amount of the other four subunits because a different antibody was used to detect eIF-2Bγ than was used to detect the other four subunits. To our knowledge, this is the first time a complex multisubunit translation initiation factor has been overexpressed using the baculovirus-infected Sf9 cell system. It was important to establish whether or not rat eIF-2B subunits expressed in Sf9 cells exhibited GEF activity. The GDP dissociation assay is a direct measurement of the GEF activity of eIF-2B since, in the presence of Mg2+, the rate-limiting step of the nucleotide exchange reaction is GDP dissociation (36Panniers R. Rowlands A.G. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5519-5525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared from Sf9 cells infected with viruses encoding pairs of subunits or the three viruses encoding all five subunits of eIF-2B. The extracts were then assayed for GEF activity by determining the percentage of [3H]GDP released from eIF-2·[3H]GDP binary complexes over a 6-min interval (Fig. 1 B). A low basal level of GEF activity was detected in extracts of cells infected with wild-type AcNPV baculovirus or in extracts of cells infected with baculoviruses encoding either the α- and δ- or β- and γ-subunits of eIF-2B (Fig. 1 B). Significantly more GEF activity was detected in lysates from cells expressing the eIF-2B ε-subunit (i.e. 40% of the bound [3H]GDP was released from eIF-2 over 6 min) compared with lysates from cells infected with wild-type AcNPV baculovirus. The amount of GEF activity detected in extracts of triply infected cells coexpressing all five eIF-2B subunits was markedly greater (∼90% of [3H]GDP bound to eIF-2 was released) than that in extracts of cells expressing eIF-2Bε alone, suggesting that a functional, five-subunit eIF-2B complex was formed in the cells. As mentioned above, extracts of cells expressing the eIF-2B ε-subunit alone exhibited enhanced GEF activity compared with extracts of cells infected with wild-type virus. Therefore, we next determined if the ε-subunit was required for the GEF activity observed in extracts of cells expressing all five subunits of eIF-2B. When cells were doubly infected with viruses expressing a four-subunit complex lacking eIF-2Bε, no GEF activity was observed (Fig.2 B). In contrast, the rate of GDP exchange observed in extracts of cells expressing a four-subunit complex lacking eIF-2Bα was greatly enhanced compared with control extracts. These results demonstrate that the eIF-2B ε-subunit is required for the GEF activity of eIF-2B, whereas the eIF-2B α-subunit is not. The activity observed for the five-subunit eIF-2B complex in Figs. 1 B and 2 B was out of the linear range of the assay, and therefore, it was necessary to titrate lysates to determine the activity of the ε-subunit alone relative to the highly active five- and four-subunit eIF-2B complexes. The results show that 1.25 μl of lysate from cells expressing all five subunits of eIF-2B or only the β-, γ-, δ-, and ε-subunits yielded a rate of exchange similar to that observed for 40 μl of lysate from cells expressing the ε-subunit alone (Fig. 3). Because the amount of ε-subunit expressed in each case was similar, the results indicate that the five-subunit and four-subunit (β, γ, δ, and ε) eIF-2B complexes were ∼40-fold more active than the eIF-2B ε-subunit alone. The enhanced rate of GDP exchange observed in extracts of cells expressing all five subunits of eIF-2B suggested that the coexpressed subunits were interacting to form a functional multisubunit complex. To examine eIF-2B complex formation in insect cells, we utilized a monoclonal antibody against the ε-subunit of rat eIF-2B previously shown to immunoprecipitate the five-subunit eIF-2B complex isolated from rat liver (30Kimball S.R. Karinch A.M. Feldhoff R.C. Mellor H. Jefferson L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In these studies, extracts of Sf9 cells expressing all five subunits of eIF-2B were immunoprecipitated using the anti-eIF-2Bε monoclonal antibody, and the resulting immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The proteins in the gel were visualized by immunoblotting with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope and reprobed with a monoclonal antibody against eIF-2Bγ. All five subunits were effectively coimmunoprecipitated with the anti-eIF-2Bε monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4 B, lane 1), indicating that the subunits interact to form a complex in insect cells. As a control for antibody specificity, Sf9 cells were doubly infected so as to express the α-, β-, γ-, and δ-subunits in the absence of the ε-subunit (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). In the absence of the ε-subunit, none of the eIF-2B subunits were immunoprecipitated by the anti-eIF-2Bε monoclonal antibody. In addition, in the absence of the anti-eIF-2Bε monoclonal antibody, none of the subunits were detected in the precipitate. Thus, in Sf9 cell extracts containing all five rat eIF-2B subunits, the subunits associate to form a stable complex that can be detected by coimmunoprecipitation. Extracts of triply infected Sf9 cells expressing either four (β, γ, δ, and ε) or all five rat eIF-2B subunits were chromatographed on a Superose 6 gel filtration column to examine the molecular mass and activity of the recombinant multisubunit complexes. As shown in Fig.5, GEF activity cofractionated with the multisubunit complex and exhibited an apparent molecular mass similar to that observed for eIF-2B isolated from rat liver. In contrast, when extracts of cells expressing eIF-2Bε alone were fractionated, GEF activity eluted at a much lower apparent molecular mass than observed for the protein purified from rat liver. The latter result suggests that the GEF activity observed in cells expressing eIF-2Bε alone is not the result of rat eIF-2Bε binding to the endogenous Sf9 cell eIF-2B α-, β-, γ-, and/or δ-subunit to form an active complex. Rather, the results suggest that the eIF-2B ε-subunit alone exhibits GEF activity. In vivo, the GEF activity of eIF-2B is competitively inhibited by phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eIF-2 by the protein kinases PKR, HCR, and GCN2. Genetic analyses and transfection studies with mammalian eIF-2 kinases in yeast indicate that the inhibitory effects of eIF-2α phosphorylation are mediated in part by the α-subunit of eIF-2B (37Dever T.E. Chen J.-J. Barber G.N. Cigan A.M. Feng L. Donahue T.F. London I.M. Katze M.G. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). However, the studies conducted in yeast provide an indirect measurement of eIF-2B activity since the parameter used is the induction of the histidine biosynthetic pathway in response to eIF-2α phosphorylation. The expression of recombinant eIF-2B subunits in Sf9 cells provided an opportunity, for the first time, to directly measure the effect of eIF-2α phosphorylation on eIF-2B activity. We therefore examined the effects of eIF-2α phosphorylation on the activity of four-subunit (β, γ, δ, and ε) and five-subunit rat eIF-2B protein complexes produced in Sf9 insect cells. GEF assays were conducted on the cell extracts following preincubation of the extract with either unphosphorylated eIF-2 or eIF-2 phosphorylated by HCR in vitro. As shown in Fig. 6, extracts of cells expressing either four eIF-2B subunits (β, γ, δ, and ε) or the five-subunit complex exhibited similar rates of GDP exchange, and in both cases, the rate of exchange was significantly greater than in extracts of cells infected with wild-type virus. The rate of GDP exchange measured both in extracts of cells expressing all five subunits and in extracts of cells infected with wild-type virus was greatly reduced when extracts were preincubated with phosphorylated eIF-2 compared with preincubation with unphosphorylated eIF-2 (Fig. 6). In contrast, the activity of the eIF-2B complex lacking the α-subunit was not inhibited by phosphorylated eIF-2. The amount of eIF-2α in the phosphorylated form at the end of the assay was the same for each condition (data not shown), demonstrating that the lack of inhibition observed with cell extracts expressing the four-subunit eIF-2B complex (β, γ, δ, and ε) was not the result of dephosphorylation of eIF-2α during the assay. The lack of inhibition of the four-subunit eIF-2B complex by phosphorylated eIF-2 demonstrates, for the first time, a regulatory role for the eIF-2B α-subunit using a biochemical assay. Sf9 cells are useful for the production of biologically active recombinant proteins because the proteins they express appear to undergo proper folding and correct post-translational modifications (39Fraser M.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 158: 131-172PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in testing the utility of Sf9 cells to study eIF-2B as the insect cell system has been used successfully to produce active recombinant GEFs for the Ras superfamily of proteins (40Frech M. Cussac D. Chardin P. Bar-Sagi D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 41Zheng Y. Hart M.J. Cerione R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). An important feature of Sf9 cells is that they can be simultaneously infected with multiple viruses, and this allows the coexpression of multiple gene products. In the study described here, we focused on expressing all five subunits of rat eIF-2B in insect cells via baculovirus infection. The multisubunit structure of eIF-2B is more complex than most GEFs, which consist of predominantly single subunit proteins. The complex structure of eIF-2B suggests that it may contain several distinct structural and functional domains. We found that expression of the eIF-2B ε-subunit alone resulted in detectable GDP exchange compared with extracts of cells infected with wild-type virus. In addition, GEF activity was found to cofractionate with the ε-subunit during gel filtration chromatography. In contrast, we have not been able to detect any GEF activity following purification of eIF-2Bε using an anti-FLAG immunoaffinity resin (data not shown). It is possible that the conditions used during the purification resulted in inactivation of the protein. Nonetheless, we feel that the assumption that eIF-2Bε alone manifests GEF activity must be viewed with caution until further proof validating the activity of the individual subunit is obtained. By coinfecting insect cells with a combination of three recombinant baculoviruses, we were able to simultaneously express all five subunits of rat eIF-2B in Sf9 insect cells and to show that the expressed complex exhibited GEF activity. The presence of the eIF-2B ε-subunit was required for GEF activity, supporting a catalytic role for this subunit. This result is consistent with the previous observation (42Oldfield S. Jones B.L. Tanton D. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 399-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) that the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of purified eIF-2B could be blocked by monoclonal antibodies recognizing the ε-subunit. The formation of an intact eIF-2B complex in coinfected insect cells was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and gel filtration assays. In this study, we also used the insect cell expression system to explore the role of eIF-2Bα in the regulation of eIF-2B activity. Studies in yeast suggest that a four-subunit eIF-2B complex lacking eIF-2Bα is functional since deletion of GCN3 (eIF-2Bα) has no effect on cell growth under normal conditions (27Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In contrast, Craddock and Proud (29Craddock B.L. Proud C.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 220: 843-847Google Scholar) recently reported that purified rabbit eIF-2B lacking eIF-2Bα was not functional and suggested that mammalian eIF-2B may therefore differ from yeast eIF-2B in the requirement for the α-subunit. By overexpressing combinations of rat eIF-2B subunits in Sf9 cells, we show that the α-subunit of eIF-2B is not required for GEF activity. Furthermore, using gel filtration chromatography, we were able to confirm that the GEF activity in Sf9 cell lysates containing the four-subunit eIF-2B complex (lacking eIF-2Bα) was due to the formation of an active four-subunit complex. It is not clear why the α-subunit was missing from certain purified rabbit eIF-2B preparations reported by Craddock and Proud (29Craddock B.L. Proud C.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 220: 843-847Google Scholar). One interpretation is that the absence of the α-subunit in the rabbit eIF-2B preparations might indicate modifications in the other eIF-2B subunits that were not observed, but that might be inhibiting the activity of the purified four-subunit eIF-2B complex. The α-subunit of eIF-2 is phosphorylated at Ser51 by three different protein kinases (PKR, HCR, and GCN2), and this phosphorylation event is an important mechanism used by cells to control translation initiation in response to a variety of stresses (3Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). In addition, recent evidence suggests that at least one of the eIF-2α kinases, PKR, may have a potential role as a tumor suppressor in normal cells and function in the restraint of cell growth (43Barber G.N. Wambach M. Thompson S. Jagus R. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3138-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In yeast, deletion of the eIF-2B α-subunit (GCN3) suppresses the lethal effects from a constitutively active GCN2 kinase or the growth inhibitory effects resulting from high level exogenous expression of mammalian eIF-2α kinases (HCR and PKR) (37Dever T.E. Chen J.-J. Barber G.N. Cigan A.M. Feng L. Donahue T.F. London I.M. Katze M.G. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The genetic and expression studies in yeast provide indirect evidence that the GEF activity of eIF-2B lacking the α-subunit is insensitive to phosphorylation of eIF-2α. Phosphorylated eIF-2 has an increased affinity for eIF-2B and acts as a competitive inhibitor since the complex formed does not undergo GDP/GTP exchange. The inhibition of eIF-2B activity impairs translation initiation by reducing the availability of ternary complexes (eIF-2·GTP·Met-tRNAi). In this report, we provide direct evidence that the effect of eIF-2 phosphorylation is indeed mediated by the α-subunit of eIF-2B because the GEF activity of a four-subunit eIF-2B complex lacking eIF-2Bα was insensitive to eIF-2α phosphorylation. Finally, the baculovirus-infected insect cell expression system may prove useful for determining the mechanism by which eIF-2B catalyzes the GEF reaction on eIF-2. At least two possible mechanisms have been proposed for the eIF-2B-catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange reaction (46Price N. Proud C. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1994; 76: 748-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). One possible model is the substituted enzyme (ping-pong) mechanism, which involves the sequential release of GDP and the binding of GTP to eIF-2 catalyzed by eIF-2B. An alternative mechanism is based upon kinetic analysis of the GDP exchange reaction and involves complex formation between all four components of the exchange reaction (eIF-2, GDP, eIF-2B, and GTP). The four-component mechanism implies that eIF-2B contains a binding site for GTP. Dholakia et al. (47Dholakia J.N. Francis B.R. Haley B.E. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20638-20642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the binding of a photoreactive 8-azido analog of GTP to the β-subunit of eIF-2B and therefore suggested that eIF-2B is a GTP-binding protein. The GTP binding data are difficult to reconcile with the amino acid sequences of yeast or mammalian eIF-2B subunits since none of the subunits harbor a consensus sequence for GTP binding. Future studies using different combinations of normal and mutant versions of individual eIF-2B subunits will be required to further delineate their functional roles in the guanine nucleotide exchange reaction.

https://openalex.org/W2334308089,"The cellular transformation by v-Src or v-Crk induces tyrosine phosphorylation of a common substrate molecule, p130Cas (Cas), which tightly binds these oncoproteins in vivo. From its structure, Cas is deduced to be an ideal substrate for Src family kinases and Abl kinase. The tyrosine kinase activity associated with Cas was analysed using mouse variant fibroblasts lacking at least one of tyrosine kinases. In normal fibroblasts, Cas is associated with a significant level of tyrosine kinase activity which efficiently phosphorylates Cas in vitro. The Cas-associated tyrosine kinase activity was remarkably elevated in Csk−/− cells, which resulted in hyperphos-phorylation of cellular Cas. The associated kinase activity was slightly increased in Src−/− cells whereas not significantly changed in Abl−/− nor Fak−/− cells. On the contrary, the Cas-associated kinase activity was remarkably decreased in Fyn−/− cells. At the same time, association of Cas with Fyn kinase in vitro was most obviously detected in normal fibroblasts as well as Csk−/− cells. Transient expression of v-Crk induced elevation of the Cas-associated kinase activity in all of these cell lines except the primary culture of Fyn−/− fibroblasts. These results indicate that Fyn kinase plays an essential role in v-Crk-mediated phosphorylation of Cas."

In rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells, IGF I (20 ng/ml) induced a sustained (>30 min) increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of both Src-homology 2 domain-docking insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and Src-homology 2-binding tyrosine phosphatase 1D (PTP-1D). In addition, IGF I stimulated PTP-1D phosphatase activity. Ang II (10(-7) M) also increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (4-fold), PTP-1D (5-fold), and PTP-1D activity (3-4-fold), but with a more transient time course. Ang II also induced PTP-1D.IRS-1 complex formation. These Ang II-induced events were not affected by preincubation with an anti-IGF I antibody, suggesting that Ang II's actions were not mediated via the autocrine secretion of IGF I. Anti-PTP-1D antibody electroporation attenuated Ang II-induced PTP-1D.IRS-1 complex formation and PTP-1D tyrosine phosphorylation and activation. Our findings show that the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and PTP-1D represents a convergent intracellular signaling cascade stimulated by both growth factor (i.e. IGF I) and G-protein-coupled (i.e. AT1) receptors."

LTC4 conversion to LTD4has long been thought to be mediated solely by GGT (7Meister A. Larsson A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Diseases. 7th Ed.

GGT-rel shares an overall 40% amino acid sequence identity with human GGT and is capable of cleaving the γ-glutamyl linkage of LTC4, but it is unable to hydrolyze synthetic substrates that are commonly used for assaying GGT. This activity has been reported to be absent in mice (9Heisterkamp N. Rajpert-De Meyts E. Uribe L. Forman H.J. Groffen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the distribution of GGT activity and the sites of peptidyl leukotriene actions are not concordant. In the mouse, GGT tends to be expressed at very high levels in epithelia concerned with catabolism of GSH and reabsorption of its constituent amino acids (kidney and small intestine) and other ductular and secretory epithelia (pancreas and seminal vesicles) (7Meister A.

It is characteristically low in organs in which leukotrienes may play a role in responses to injury (e.g. lung, heart, and lymphoid tissue (spleen)). In addition, the types of responses mediated by the peptidyl leukotrienes (vasoconstriction, bronchoconstriction, increases in vascular permeability, and mucus formation) do not occur in close proximity to sites where GGT is most abundant (13Henderson Jr., W.R.

Lett. 1980; 20: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15Shine H.D. Haber B. Brain Res. 1981; 217: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Frey A. Meckelein B. Weiler-Guttler H. Mockel B. Flach R. Gassen H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the discordance between peptidyl leukotriene targets and GGT activity raises the possibility that there are other LTC4-cleaving enzymes in the mouse. We have recently used homologous recombination to inactivate GGT in the mouse (12Lieberman M.W. Wiseman A.L. Shi Z-Z. Carter B.Z. Barrios R. Ou C-N. Chevez-Barrios P. Wang Y. Habib G.M. Goodman J.C. Huang S.L. Lebovitz R.M. Matzuk M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7923-7926Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Mice homozygous for this mutation are completely GGT-deficient and have the expected phenotype (glutathionemia and massive glutathionuria). Thus, they represent a useful model to evaluate the conversion of LTC4 to LTD4 in the absence of GGT. In this paper we report the results of our initial experiments in which we demonstrate the presence of an additional LTC4/LTD4-converting enzyme in the mouse. GGT-deficient mice were developed in our laboratory (12Lieberman M.W. Wiseman A.L. Shi Z-Z. Carter B.Z. Barrios R. Ou C-N. Chevez-Barrios P. Wang Y. Habib G.M. Goodman J.C. Huang S.L. Lebovitz R.M. Matzuk M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7923-7926Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). All mice used in this study were 6–7 weeks old. [glycine-2-3H]GSH was purchased from DuPont NEN. Bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid was obtained from GFS Chemicals (Columbus, OH), and HPLC grade methanol from Baxter Healthcare Corp. (McGaw Park, IL). LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, GSH, S-decyl-GSH, γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide, papain, and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Total homogenates from different tissues of both wild type and GGT-deficient female mice and the partially purified enzyme from the small intestine of GGT-deficient mice (see below) were incubated with 5 μmLTC4 in a total of 0.2 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for a preset time. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.8 ml of methanol and then centrifuged. The supernatant was adjusted to 13% methanol with water, and the solution was loaded onto a 3-ml octadecyl disposable extraction column (J. T. Baker Inc., Philipburg, NJ) conditioned as recommended by the manufacturer. The column was washed with water followed by 10% methanol to remove proteins and other impurities. LTC4 and its conversion products were eluted with methanol, dried by Speedvac, and separated by HPLC on a C18 reversed-phase column (Customsil ODS, 4.6 × 150 mm, 3-μm particles, Custom LC, Houston, TX) as described (17Denzlinger C. Guhlmann A. Scheuber P.H. Wilker D. Hammer D.K. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15601-15606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mobile phase consisted of methanol:water:acetic acid (65:35:0.1), pH 5.6, and the column effluent was monitored at 280 nm. We expressed the specific activity of LTC4-converting activity as nmol of LTC4 converted/h/mg of protein by measuring the formation of products (LTD4 and sometimes LTE4; LTE4 is formed by the action of dipeptidase on LTD4 in some preparations (see also “Results”)). The protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). For LTC4 to LTD4 conversion, theKm of the newly discovered enzyme from GGT-deficient mouse spleen and GGT from wild type mouse kidney was determined by measuring LTC4-converting activity with increasing LTC4 concentration from a double-reciprocal plot (1/v and 1/[S]) (18Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York1979: 55-68Google Scholar). Various tissues from both wild type and GGT-deficient female mice were homogenized with a Polytron Tissuemizer in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. GGT activity was assayed by incubating the homogenates from various tissues with γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide and Gly-Gly for a preset time at 37 °C as described (12Lieberman M.W. Wiseman A.L. Shi Z-Z. Carter B.Z. Barrios R. Ou C-N. Chevez-Barrios P. Wang Y. Habib G.M. Goodman J.C. Huang S.L. Lebovitz R.M. Matzuk M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7923-7926Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The specific activity is expressed as μmol of p-nitroanilide released/min/mg of protein. Tissue homogenates from either wild type mouse kidney or GGT-deficient mouse spleen were incubated with 0.2 mm GSH, 0.2 mm Gly-Gly and 0.2 mmdithiothreitol in a total of 0.5 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for various lengths of time. In some experiments, 1 μl of [glycine-2-3H]GSH (43.8 Ci/mmol, 1 μCi/μl) was added to the reaction. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 70% perchloric acid, 50 μl of 15 mm bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid, and 50 μl of 2.5 mm γ-Glu-Glu as an internal standard. Following derivatization with 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene, the reaction was analyzed by a reversed-phase ion exchange HPLC using a 3-aminopropyl column (4.6 × 200 mm, 5-μm particles; CEL Associates, Houston, TX) as described (19Fariss M.W. Reed D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The column effluent was monitored at 365 nm. The fractions were collected and counted using a Beckman LS scintillation counter. LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 standards and preparations from incubations of LTC4 and homogenates from both wild type and GGT-deficient mice were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC as described above. The fractions corresponding to retention times of LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 were collected, dried, and subjected to FAB-MS/MS analysis. Tandem mass spectrometric analyses were performed using a VG ZAB-SEQ (VG Analytical, Manchester, UK) hybrid mass spectrometer of BEqQ configuration (B, magnetic sector; E, electric sector; q, radio frequency-only quadrupole; Q, quadrupole mass filter), equipped with a VG 11–250J data system. The methods employed were similar to those previously described (20Gaskell S.J. Orkiszewski R.S. Caprioli R.M. Continuous Flow Fast Atom Bombardment Mass Spectrometry. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1990: 29-43Google Scholar, 21Raftery M.J. Thorne G.C. Orkiszewski R.S. Gaskell S.J. Biomed. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1990; 19: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, ionization was accomplished by continuous flow FAB using xenon atoms (8 keV) for the primary atom beam. Delivery of solvent (water:acetonitrile (50:50) containing 1% saturated aqueous oxalic acid and 1% 2,2′-dithiodiethanol) was via a fused silica capillary (50 μm inner diameter). Flow rate was maintained at 4.5 μl/min using a Waters prototype syringe pump controlled by the modified output of a Waters model 680 gradient controller. Samples (10 μl) were injected using a Rheodyne model 7125 injector. The accelerating voltage was 8 kV, and the ion source temperature was 70 °C. Narrow range parent ion scanning analyses were obtained by operating the instrument under hardware control. For LTC4, the instrument was set to detect parents of ions with a mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio of 308; similarly, the instrument was set to detect parents of m/z 319 for LTD4 and LTE4. Homogenates from either wild type mouse kidney or GGT-deficient mouse spleen were incubated with 0.2 mm S-decyl-GSH and 0.2 mm Gly-Gly in a final volume of 0.2 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for a preset time. The reactions were stopped by adding 100 μl of 70% perchloric acid, 50 μl of 50 mm bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid, derivatized as described (19Fariss M.W. Reed D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), and analyzed by the same reversed-phase HPLC column under the same conditions as for leukotriene analysis and monitored at 365 nm. To determine theKm of S-decyl-GSH cleavage by the newly discovered enzyme, the formation of S-decyl-Cys-Gly was measured in GGT-deficient mouse spleen homogenates, andKm was calculated from a double-reciprocal plot (1/v and 1/[S]) (18Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York1979: 55-68Google Scholar). Based on preliminary experiments that showed the activity to be membrane-bound, we adapted the method of Meister with minor modification (22Meister A. Tate S.S. Griffith O.W. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 237-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Briefly, small intestine from GGT-deficient mice was homogenized with 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 50 mmd-mannitol; 1 m CaCl2 solution was then added to the homogenate to a final concentration of 10 mm. The homogenate was placed on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 43,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet obtained was suspended in the above buffer using an all glass Dounce homogenizer. This step was repeated once, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl to obtain the membrane fraction. The membrane fraction was treated with papain (17 units/mg of protein) at a final concentration of 1 mg of papain/15 mg of total membrane protein at 25 °C for 2 h and centrifuged at 43,000 × gfor 30 min. Ammonia sulfate was added to the supernatant to achieve 90% of saturation. The solution was set at 4 °C for 3 h, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The solution was subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a Sephadex G-150 column equilibrated and developed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Fractions containing the LTC4-converting activity were pooled and concentrated by a Centricon concentrator with a 30-kDa molecular mass cut-off. This procedure resulted in about 10-fold purification of the enzyme. γ-Glutamyl-p-nitroanilide is the standard substrate used to assay GGT activity in mammalian tissues (22Meister A. Tate S.S. Griffith O.W. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 237-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, GGT-deficient mice fail to cleave this substrate, while in wild type mice GGT levels are high in kidney, pancreas, and small intestine and low in spleen, lung, and liver (see also Ref. 12Lieberman M.W. Wiseman A.L. Shi Z-Z. Carter B.Z. Barrios R. Ou C-N. Chevez-Barrios P. Wang Y. Habib G.M. Goodman J.C. Huang S.L. Lebovitz R.M. Matzuk M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7923-7926Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). These data indicate not only that GGT is absent from these mutant mice but also that no other enzyme in mice cleaves this substrate. Similarly, γ-glutamyl-4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide, the usual histochemical substrate for GGT (23Rutenburg A.M. Kim H. Fischbein J.W. Hanker J.S. Wasserkrug H.L. Seligman A.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1969; 17: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar), was inactive as a histochemical substrate in GGT-deficient mice (data not shown), and thus, like γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide, it is not cleaved by other enzymes in mice.Table ILTC4-converting activity and γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide hydrolysis activity in GGT-deficient and wild type miceTissuesLTC4conversionγ-GPNA1-aγ-Glutamyl-p-nitroanilide. hydrolysisGGT-deficientWild typeGGT-deficientWild typenmol/h/mg proteinμmol/min/mg proteinSpleen3.243.81ND1-bND, not detectable.2.11Small intestine1.3048.47ND1-cFrom Ref. 12.24.701-cFrom Ref. 12.Kidney1.25502.40ND1-cFrom Ref. 12.329.001-cFrom Ref. 12.Pancreas0.90248.50ND1-cFrom Ref. 12.209.001-cFrom Ref. 12.Liver0.620.66ND0.10Lung0.280.78ND1.12Tissue homogenates from female mice were used for the assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-a γ-Glutamyl-p-nitroanilide.1-b ND, not detectable.1-c From Ref. 12Lieberman M.W.

A. 1996; 93: 7923-7926Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar. Open table in a new tab Tissue homogenates from female mice were used for the assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Since our previous studies did not detect any GGT activity in the GGT-deficient mice (12Lieberman M.W. Wiseman A.L. Shi Z-Z. Carter B.Z. Barrios R. Ou C-N. Chevez-Barrios P. Wang Y. Habib G.M. Goodman J.C. Huang S.L. Lebovitz R.M. Matzuk M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7923-7926Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that tissues from these mice would be unable to cleave LTC4. Our initial experiments with LTC4 were performed on wild type kidney as a positive control. When we examined homogenates of wild type kidney for the ability to metabolize LTC4, we found, as expected, that LTC4 was readily cleaved to LTD4: homogenates containing 50 μg of protein cleaved 39% of LTC4 (0.39 nmol) in 1 min with the appearance of a peak corresponding to LTD4 (Fig. 1 A). Under similar conditions we were unable to detect degradation of LTC4 in homogenates of GGT-deficient kidney (not shown); however, longer incubation times (over 1 h) revealed conversion of LTC4 to LTD4 (Fig. 1 B). This result indicates that LTC4-converting activity other than GGT exists in mice. Next we surveyed a variety of tissues from GGT-deficient mice to determine the tissue distribution of this newly detected activity. We started by assaying mouse tissues that normally express little or no GGT activity such as spleen, adult liver, and lung for LTC4metabolism (Fig. 2). We found that incubation of LTC4 with homogenates from these tissues resulted in a decrease in LTC4 (peaks 1) and the appearance of products having the same retention times as LTD4(peaks 2) and LTE4 (peaks 3) (Fig. 2,left). These data indicate that LTC4 is metabolized by GGT-deficient mouse spleen, liver, and lung homogenates. Under the same conditions, homogenates from wild type mouse spleen, liver, and lung also cleave LTC4 (Fig. 2,right). Further, the cleavage of LTC4 by homogenates from GGT-deficient mice occurs at rates comparable with those seen in preparations from wild type mice. In many tissues, we observed two new peaks following incubation, one corresponding to the retention time for LTD4 and the other to that for LTE4. The latter product is the result of the conversion of LTD4 to LTE4 by dipeptidase activity present in some tissues (2Huber M. Keppler D. Sies H. Ketterer B. Leukotrienes and the Mercapturate Pathway in Glutathione Conjugation: Mechanisms and Biological Significance. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1988: 449-470Google Scholar, 24Habib G.M. Barrios R. Shi Z.-Z. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16273-16280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We evaluated homogenates of pancreas and small intestine for the ability to cleave LTC4 and found results similar to those from kidney: homogenates from GGT-deficient mice cleaved LTC4 at much reduced rates compared with pancreas and small intestine homogenates from wild type mice (Fig. 3). Results from these and similar experiments were used to calculate the specific activity of LTC4 conversion for various tissues of GGT-deficient and wild type mice (Table I). In GGT-deficient mice, the highest level of this new activity is found in spleen. Kidney, small intestine, and pancreas have activity levels that are about 30–40% that of spleen, while liver and lung have somewhat lower levels. In contrast, in wild type mice the highest level is found in kidney, followed by pancreas and then small intestine. This order of activity is similar to that of GGT when assayed by γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide (Table I; see also Ref. 12Lieberman M.W. Wiseman A.L. Shi Z-Z. Carter B.Z. Barrios R. Ou C-N. Chevez-Barrios P. Wang Y. Habib G.M. Goodman J.C. Huang S.L. Lebovitz R.M. Matzuk M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7923-7926Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). It is of interest, however, that in tissues with low GGT activity (liver, lung, and spleen), 35–95% of LTC4 cleavage is accounted for by this newly detected enzyme (Table I). Thus, in spleen and liver almost all of the metabolism of LTC4 appears to result from this enzyme activity rather than from GGT. HPLC peaks corresponding to the retention times of LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 from reactions run with homogenates from both wild type and GGT-deficient mice were analyzed by a FAB-MS/MS (20Gaskell S.J. Orkiszewski R.S. Caprioli R.M. Continuous Flow Fast Atom Bombardment Mass Spectrometry. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1990: 29-43Google Scholar, 21Raftery M.J. Thorne G.C. Orkiszewski R.S. Gaskell S.J. Biomed. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1990; 19: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our studies revealed that the presumed LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 peaks produced the same [M + H]+ions and fragment ions as standard LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 (results not shown). These data confirm that the reactions we have monitored by HPLC represent conversion of LTC4 to LTD4 and LTE4. GGT is believed to be the major enzyme responsible for the cleavage of GSH. We were curious to know if the newly identified LTC4-converting activity in GGT-deficient mice could also metabolize GSH. This question was examined by two approaches. The first involved monitoring the disappearance of GSH enzymatically from homogenates of spleens of GGT-deficient mice (25Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5487) Google Scholar). We were unable to demonstrate any loss of GSH using this method (data not shown). The second method involved HPLC and was adapted from Heisterkampet al. (9Heisterkamp N. Rajpert-De Meyts E. Uribe L. Forman H.J. Groffen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6303-6307Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These investigators identified an enzyme from human material termed GGT-rel (GGT-related) that cleaved LTC4 and suggested that it might cleave the γ-glutamyl moiety from GSH. We modified the assay conditions of Heisterkampet al. and used nonradioactive GSH and [glycine-2-3H]GSH in the incubation mixtures to improve assay sensitivity. We also added 0.2 mmdithiothreitol in the reaction to prevent the conversion of GSH to GSSG. We monitored the appearance of products (Cys-Gly, Cys, and Gly) and the disappearance of GSH spectrophotometrically or by liquid scintillation counting of HPLC effluent. No metabolism of GSH was observed with either method in the absence of homogenate (Fig.4, A1 and B1), while kidney homogenates from wild type mice readily cleaved GSH (positive control; Fig. 4, A2 and B2). Fig. 4, A3 andB3, illustrates profiles of homogenates of spleen from GGT-deficient mice in which no loss of GSH or appearance of Cys-Gly, Cys, or Gly was detected spectrophotometrically or by liquid scintillation counting even after a 3-h incubation. To confirm our results, we also used a partially purified enzyme preparation (see “Experimental Procedures”) to assay for the hydrolysis of GSH. We standardized conditions so that a kidney homogenate from wild type (GGT-positive) mouse and our partially purified preparation catalyzed the same amount of LTC4 to LTD4 conversion and used these to assay for GSH cleavage. We could not detect any GSH cleavage with the partially purified enzyme from the small intestine of GGT-deficient mice, while under the same conditions, the wild type kidney homogenate cleaved 13.5% (6.75 nmol) of GSH. Thus, the newly identified LTC4-converting enzyme does not metabolize GSH or does so at a negligible rate. Cleavage of GSSG was also evaluated. It is likely that the dipeptidase (membrane-bound dipeptidase, renal dipeptidase) that cleaves Cys-Gly generated by the action of GGT actually uses Cys-bis-Gly rather than Cys-Gly as a substrate (26Kozak E.M. Tate S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6322-6327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we modified both the enzymatic approach and the nonradioactive HPLC approach described above to determine if our LTC4-cleaving activity could metabolize GSSG. In GGT-deficient mouse spleen homogenates, we could not detect cleavage of GSSG; however, when we used homogenates of wild type kidney as a positive control, GSSG cleavage was detected (data not shown). Thus, unlike GGT, the activity we have detected in GGT-deficient mice cleaves LTC4 and does not cleave GSH or GSSG. To reflect the substrate specificity of this enzyme, we suggest that the newly identified enzyme be designated γ-glutamyl leukotrienase (GGL). GGL is a membrane-bound enzyme. After centrifugation of spleen homogenates from GGT-deficient mice at 45,000 × g for 30 min, we recovered all of the GGL activity in the pellet. Treatment of similar homogenates with papain prior to centrifugation (22Meister A. Tate S.S. Griffith O.W. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 237-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) released more than 90% of the GGL activity into the supernatant. The papain-cleaved enzyme has an apparent molecular mass of ∼65 kDa by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-150 and 65–70 kDa by sedimentation velocity centrifugation using linear 5–20% sucrose gradient (27Le A. Ferrell G.A. Dishon D.S. Le Q-Q.A. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation at 60 °C for 5 min completely inactivated cleavage of LTC4, but at 37 °C the enzyme was active for as long as 5 h. Acivicin, a commonly used inhibitor of GGT (28Neil G.L. Berger A.E. Bhuyan B.K. Blowers C.L. Kuentzel S.L. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1979; 17: 375-398Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Capraro M.A. Hughey R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3408-3412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also inhibited GGL (data not shown). We determined the Kmof LTC4 to LTD4 conversion by GGL to be 2.2 × 10−6m. In contrast, theKm for this conversion by GGT was found to be an order of magnitude higher (2.0 × 10−5m). Inclusion of Gly-Gly, a γ-glutamyl acceptor, in the incubation mixture did not significantly enhance the conversion of LTC4 to LTD4 (data not shown). GSH does not appear to be a competitive inhibitor of GGL, since even an 80-fold molar excess of GSH in the reaction mixture does not alter the rate of cleavage of LTC4 by GGL (data not shown). Studies from Goffinet and Nguyen (30Goffinet A.M. Nguyen A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 161: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) demonstrated that mouse brain LTC4 binding sites are also S-alkyl-GSH binding sites. S-Decyl-GSH has the strongest binding among all of the S-alkyl-GSH analyzed and had binding activity similar to LTC4. We hypothesized that S-decyl-GSH might be a substrate for GGL and examined the cleavage of S-decyl-GSH by GGL. Our results indicated that, like GGT, GGL indeed hydrolyzesS-decyl-GSH (results not shown). We compared theKm of GGL using S-decyl-GSH as a substrate with the value we obtained when LTC4 was used as a substrate. We found that the Km forS-decyl-GSH is about 3.0 × 10−5m, more than an order of magnitude higher than the value of 2.2 × 10−6m we found for LTC4. The fact that GGL cleaves LTC4 andS-decyl-GSH but not GSH, GSSG, γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide, and γ-glutamyl-4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide suggests that GGL prefers hydrophobic GSH conjugates. Using transgenic mice that lack GGT, we have detected an enzyme that cleaves the γ-glutamyl group from LTC4 and generates LTD4. The activity is highest in spleen followed by small intestine and kidney. Relatively high levels are also found in liver and lung, organs in which GGT activity is less than 1% of that seen in kidney (Table I). GGL cleaves LTC4, but GSH and GSSG, which are the major substrates for GGT in organs such as kidney, do not appear to be cleaved by GGL. Support for this conclusion also comes from our work with GGT-deficient mice: urine levels of GSH in GGT-deficient mice are ∼15 mm compared with urine levels of ∼6 μm in wild type mice (12Lieberman M.W. Wiseman A.L. Shi Z-Z. Carter B.Z. Barrios R. Ou C-N. Chevez-Barrios P. Wang Y. Habib G.M. Goodman J.C. Huang S.L. Lebovitz R.M. Matzuk M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7923-7926Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), suggesting that GGL metabolizes little, if any, of the GSH filtered or secreted by the kidney. The fact that the Km of GGL (2.2 × 10−6m) is an order of magnitude lower than that of GGT (2.0 × 10−5m) indicates that GGL has higher affinity for LTC4 than GGT. Thus, LTC4 is likely to be a physiologically significant substrate for GGL. Several possibilities may explain why the level of GGL activity is low under our assay conditions. First, the expression of GGL may be confined to certain cell types within organs, and analysis of GGL activity from homogenates of whole organs may underestimate GGL activity. Second, the GGL activity may be constitutively low, but inducible under appropriate conditions including responses to physiological stimuli or injury. Third, we cannot exclude the possibility that compounds other than LTC4 may be better substrates for GGL. In addition to its cleavage of LTC4, GGL is capable of cleaving S-decyl-GSH. Although we have not tested S-GSH conjugates exhaustively, relatively long chain S-GSH conjugates of aliphatic (hydrophobic) moieties (LTC4 andS-decyl-GSH) seem to be preferred substrates for GGL. GGL will not cleave GSH, GSSG, γ-glutamyl-nitroanilide, or γ-glutamyl-naphthylamide; all of them are good substrates for GGT. Thus, based on the substrates examined to date, GGL appears to have a more restricted substrate specificity than GGT and cleaves only some of the γ-glutamyl compounds that GGT metabolizes. At present, we have not found a compound that is a specific substrate for GGL. In humans another enzyme, termed GGT-rel, that cleaves LTC4has been identified (9Heisterkamp N. Rajpert-De Meyts E. Uribe L. Forman H.J. Groffen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6303-6307Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It appears to be a different enzyme from GGL, since GGT-rel is not found in the mouse, and it may cleave GSH as well (9Heisterkamp N. Rajpert-De Meyts E. Uribe L. Forman H.J. Groffen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6303-6307Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, at present neither GGT-rel nor GGL has been extensively characterized, and it is not inconceivable that they may represent the human and mouse counterparts of the same enzyme. Because we have not yet extensively purified GGL, it is conceivable that GGL represents more than one enzyme. However, we view this possibility as unlikely. In addition to a partial overlap in substrate specificity, GGL and GGT share some properties. Both are membrane-bound and are inhibited by acivicin. The papain-released fragment of GGL from mouse small intestine has an apparent molecular mass of 65 kDa compared to 68 kDa for GGT from rat kidney (22Meister A. Tate S.S. Griffith O.W. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 237-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). This observation must be viewed with some caution, since GGT at least is known to exist in many glycosylated forms. However, all of these observations suggest that like human GGT and GGT-rel, mouse GGT and GGL may be related. Nevertheless, GGL and GGT are clearly separate enzymes, as evidenced by the fact that we have characterized GGL in tissues of GGT-deficient mice. In addition, GGL and GGT have different substrate preferences and different tissue distributions. The tissue distribution of the two enzymes raises several interesting questions about their functions. It is unclear, for example, why GGL is expressed in kidney, pancreas, and small intestine, where GGT is expressed at very high levels. One possibility is that GGL has other as yet unidentified functions; for example, it may cleave substrates that are not metabolized by GGT. Another possibility is that within these organs GGL and GGT have different cellular distributions. It is known, for example, that GGT is confined to the proximal tubular cells of the kidney and the villous epithelium of the small intestine (31Spater H.W. Poruchynsky M.S. Quintana N. Inoue M. Novikoff A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3547-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Marathe G.V. Nash B. Haschemeyer R.H. Tate S.S. FEBS Lett. 1979; 107: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and may function at these sites to initiate the degradation of circulating or biliary LTC4 to LTD4. However, much of the physiologic action of LTC4/LTD4 occurs at sites where responses to injury occur, such as the smooth muscle of vessels and bronchi/bronchioles, and in inflammatory exudates. GGL function may be related to these responses and occur at the sites of these responses. Thus, it is possible that in the kidney and the small intestine, for example, the metabolism of LTC4 may be divided into two “compartments,” one concerned with physiological function in these organs and the other with the clearance of peptidyl leukotrienes from the body. GGL activity accounts for 35–95% of the LTC4-metabolizing activity in spleen, lung, and liver. It may be that the substrate specificity of GGL compared with GGT is an advantage in these organs. Because GSH/GSSG is not cleaved by GGL, the function of this enzyme may be important in environments in which the extracellular reducing capability of GSH is necessary but generation of LTD4 is also required. Such conditions are met in the lung, in which GSH plays an important role in protection from oxidative injury and the generation of LTD4 may be essential as part of the response to injury in this organ. All of the above considerations suggest that this newly identified enzyme may play a significant role in the metabolism of leukotrienes. We thank Drs. Mark L. Entman, Hiram F. Gilbert, Richard N. Sifers, and Russell M. Lebovitz for helpful discussion, Yan Liu for helping with some experiments, and Cheryl L. Rognerud for technical assistance with HPLC."

Three conserved amino acids in the segment defined by residues 317–330 appear particularly crucial for enzymatic activity. For example, when Arg-325 is replaced by alanine or lysine, the resulting mutant enzymes possess no detectable asparagine synthetase activity. The catalytic activity of the R325A AS-B mutant can, however, be restored to about 1/6 of that of wild-type AS-B by the addition of guanidinium HCl (GdmHCl). Detailed kinetic analysis of the rescued activity suggests that Arg-325 is involved in stabilization of a pentacovalent intermediate leading to the formation β-aspartyl-AMP. This rescue experiment is the second example in which the function of a critical arginine residue that has been substituted by mutagenesis is restored by GdmHCl. Mutation of Thr-322 and Thr-323 also produces enzymes with altered kinetic properties, suggesting that these threonines are involved in aspartate binding and/or stabilization of intermediatesen route to β-aspartyl-AMP. These experiments are the first to identify residues outside of the N-terminal glutamine amide transfer domain that have any functional role in asparagine synthesis.

These experiments are the first to identify residues outside of the N-terminal glutamine amide transfer domain that have any functional role in asparagine synthesis. A great deal of interest in asparagine metabolism has resulted from the finding that certain leukemias can be treated by the administration of l-asparaginase (see review, 1Chakrabarti R. Schuster S.M. Int. J. Pediat. Hematol./Oncol. 1997; Google Scholar). Experiments suggest that the effectiveness of this protocol is dependent upon decreasing the circulating amount of asparagine (2Broome J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1968; 244: 1055-1072Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although administration of l-asparaginase is accepted as an essential component of modern therapy, it is fraught with serious side effects and plagued by the appearance of resistant leukemias. An alternative, or adjunct, approach to the use ofl-asparaginase might be to lower circulating asparagine by inhibiting asparagine synthetase (AS), 1The abbreviations used are: AS, asparagine synthetase; AS-B E. coli asparagine synthetase B; GdmHCl, guanidinium hydrochloride; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CSA, cysteinesulfinic acid; FSBA, 5′-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine; MetRS, methionyl tRNA aminoacyl synthetase; bp, base pair(s); GAT, glutamine amide transfer; I, intermediate. the enzyme responsible for its production. Of several hundred compounds that have been evaluated as AS inhibitors, however, none have exhibited sufficient potency and specificity to warrant clinical consideration (3Cooney D.A. Driscol J.S. Milman H.A. Jayaram H.N. Davis R.D. Cancer Treat. Rep. 1976; 60: 1493-1557PubMed Google Scholar). This failure can be partly explained by the lack of detailed mechanistic information on AS. Two classes of enzymes catalyzing asparagine synthesis have been described that possess no sequence similarity and may consequently have arisen by convergent evolution. Ammonia-dependent asparagine synthetases in prokaryotes such as Klebsiella aerogenes andEscherichia coli (4Reitzer L.J. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 1299-1313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cedar H. Schwartz J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4112-4121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cedar H. Schwartz J.H. J.

Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 212-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Mehlhaff P. Luehr C.A. Schuster S.M.

In addition, this class of synthetases acts as glutaminases in the absence of aspartate (Reaction 3). E. coli contains two unlinked genes coding for asparagine synthetases (7Humbert R. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 212-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Asparagine synthetase A (AS-A), the product of the 990-bp asnA gene for which the complete nucleotide sequence is known, has been isolated and exhibits strictly ammonia-dependent activity (5Cedar H. Schwartz J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4112-4121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cedar H. Schwartz J.H. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 4669-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence for the 1662-bp asnB gene, encoding asparagine synthetase B (AS-B), has also been cloned and sequenced (11Scofield M.A. Lewis W.S. Schuster S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12895-12902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on its primary amino acid sequence, AS-B is a purF (class II) amidotransferase, possessing an N-terminal cysteine residue that is essential for glutamine-dependent activity (12Zalkin H. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1993; 66: 203-309PubMed Google Scholar). Our recent work describing a number of site-specific AS-B mutants has identified specific amino acids in the N-terminal glutamine amide transfer (GAT) domain that are critical to glutamine-dependent nitrogen transfer (13Boehlein S.K. Richards N.G.J. Schuster S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7450-7457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Boehlein S.K. Richards N.G.J. Walworth E.S. Schuster S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26789-26795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detailed kinetic analysis of wild-type enzyme and these mutants using alternate substrates and heavy atom isotope effects has also yielded new insights into the mechanistic role of the AS-B GAT domain (15Stoker P.W. O'Leary M.H. Boehlein S.K. Schuster S.M. Richards N.G.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3024-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Boehlein S.K. Schuster S.M. Richards N.G.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3031-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Identification of key residues in the N-terminal region of AS-B was aided by the availability of sequences for the glutamine-utilizing domains of other purF amidotransferases. On the other hand, both BLAST and FASTP analyses indicate that the primary structure of the C-terminal synthetase domain in asparagine synthetases is unique, with the exception of a small region, termed the P-loop-like motif, that is present in a number of ATP-dependent enzymes that release AMP and PPi as reaction products (17Bork P. Koonin E.V. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1994; 20: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The involvement of this motif in ATP utilization during asparagine synthesis, however, has yet to be validated using site-directed AS mutants. While raising interesting evolutionary questions, the observation that sequence similarities between AS-A and AS-B do not exist (11Scofield M.A. Lewis W.S. Schuster S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12895-12902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) complicates the identification of critical catalytic residues in the C-terminal AS-B synthetase domain. Multiple sequence alignments for several glutamine-dependent asparagine synthetases show 152 conserved residues and 92 positions in which conservative replacements are present. Of the seven regions possessing four, or more, consecutive conserved residues, two of these are in the GAT domain and appear to mediate only nitrogen transfer and glutamine hydrolysis. In this paper, we present the results of random, and site-specific, mutagenesis experiments on two of the other five regions defined by residues 317–330 and 484–500, respectively (Fig. 1). While the latter region does not appear to possess a functional role in catalysis and/or substrate binding, we report evidence supporting the hypothesis that Arg-325, Thr-322, and Thr-323 mediate β-aspartyl-AMP formation, a key intermediate in asparagine biosynthesis (5Cedar H.

Restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI), Life Technologies, Inc., or New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Deoxyadenosine 5′-[α-35S]thiotriphosphate triethylammonium salt (Sp isomer, 1000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Corp. All other reagents were the highest possible quality. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 380B DNA synthesizer by the DNA Synthesis Core Facility of the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research at the University of Florida. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed on an Ericomp (San Diego, CA) thermocycler using the GeneAmp DNA Amplification Reagent Kit with AmpliTaq from Perkin-Elmer. Thirty-five cycles consisting of denaturing at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 54 °C for 1 min during megaprimer reactions or 52 °C for 1 min during megaproduct reactions, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min were followed by a 10-min completion cycle at 72 °C. Megaprimers were purified by polyethylene glycol precipitation (0.6 volumes of 20% polyethylene glycol 8000 in 2.5 m NaCl were added to the PCR reaction, incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and washed with 2 volumes of 80% EtOH) or agarose gel electrophoresis. After gel electrophoresis, the PCR product was extracted using a Gene CleanII Kit from Bio 101, Inc. (Vista, CA). Double-stranded DNA sequencing was performed using the U. S. Biochemical Corp. Sequenase 2.0 Sequencing kit. Preparation of the template for sequencing was performed by the alkaline lysis method. All strains were derivatives of E. coli K-12: BL21DE3pLys S (F−, ompT, rb−, mb−) generously supplied by Studier and Moffatt (19Studier W.F. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar), while NM522 (sup E, thi (lac-proAB), hsd5, (r− m−-)/F′ pro AB, lac Iq Z M15) and plasmid pBluescript were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Plasmid pETB was prepared as described previously (13Boehlein S.K. Richards N.G.J. Schuster S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7450-7457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli host cells were transformed according to the procedure of Hanahan (20Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8216) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of known glutamine-dependent asparagine synthetases were aligned using a simplification of the progressive alignment method of Feng and Doolittle (21Feng D.F. Doolittle R. J. Mol. Evol. 1987; 35: 351-360Crossref Scopus (1541) Google Scholar), as implemented in the program PILEUP in the GCG Sequence Analysis Software Package (22Devereux J.R. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). All directed random mutants were constructed using the PCR megaprimer strategy (23Satar G. Sommers S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) using template pETB, and oligonucleotide primer pairs SS123 and SS82 or SS124 and SS182 (Table I). Primer SS123 and SS124 contained degenerate oligonucleotide sequences for the construction of the mutants and a silent change inserting a restriction site, which was used for screening. The megaproduct was constructed using the megaprimer and SS65, which was 5′ of the coding region of the gene. The final product was cut with the appropriate restriction enzymes, gel-purified, and ligated back into pETB. The identity of the mutated insert was verified by sequencing.Table IOligonucleotides used in construction of site-directed mutants of AS-BMutationOligo numberOligonucleotide sequenceN terminusSS655′ A GCT TCC CAT ATG TGT TCA ATT TTT GGC GTA TTC GAT 3′C terminusSS825′ CGC TTT GTT GGC ACG CGC GCA GTC 3′N terminusSS2245′ GGT CAG CTG TAT GTG GCC TCA G 3′kpn siteSS1485′ AAC CAT CTC GGT ACC GTG CAT CAC 3′Random 1SS1235′ gas acT TaT gaT gTg acc acT aTT cgc gcG TCG ACa ccg aTg TAT TTA 3′Random 2SS1245′ cgc TTC ccg Tac aac acg cca acc agT aaa gAA GCT Tac cTg TaT CGG GAG 3′R325XSS1955′ CAT CGG TGT CGA CGC *** AAT AGT GGT 3′T322YSS1965′ CAT CGG TGT CGA CGC GCG AAT AGT ATA CAC 3′T323XSS1975′ CAT CGG TGT CGA CGC GCG AAT *** GGT 3′T322VSS3515′ CAT CGG TGT CGA CGC GCG AAT AGT GAC CAC 3′T322SSS3525′ CAT CGG TGT CGA CGC GCG AAT AGT GGA CAC 3′T322ASS3535′ CAT CGG TGT CGA CGC CGC GCG AAT AGT GGC CAC 3′T323VSS3545′ CAT CGG TGT CGA CGC GCG AAT AAC GGT C 3′T323SSS3555′ CAT CGG TGT CGA CGC GCG AAT AGA GGT C 3′T323ASS3565′ CAT CGG TGT CGA CGC GCG AAT AGC GGT C 3′R325ASS3575′ CAT CGG TGT CGA CGC GGC AAT AG 3′R325KSS3585′ CAT CGG TGT CGA CGC CTT AAT AG 3′V321ASS3595′ CAT CGG TGT CGA CGC GCG AAT AGT GGT CGC ATC 3′D320ASS3605′ CAT CGG TGT CGA CGC GCG AAT AGT GGT CAC AGC ATA 3′Y319ASS3615′ CAT CGG TGT CGA CGC GCG AAT AGT GGT CAC ATC AGC AGT TT 3′T318ASS3625′ CAT CGG TGT CGA CGC GCG AAT AGT GGT CAC ATC ATA AGC TTC G 3′E317ASS3635′ CAT CGG TGT CGA CGC GCG AAT AGT GGT CAC ATC ATA AGT TGC GAT G 3′E317QSS3705′ CAT CGG TGT CGA CGC GCG AAT AGT GGT CAC ATC ATA AGT TTG GAT G 3′The codes for oligonucleotides synthesis are as follows: a, 91% A, 3% T, 3% G, 3% C; c, 91% C, 3% T, 3% G, 3% A; g, 91% G, 3% T, 3% C, 3% A; *, 25% A, 25% T, 25% G, 25% C.

Site-directed mutants with single amino acid changes were obtained as follows. A mutant in which Thr-322 was replaced by serine (T322S), produced in the directed random mutagenesis experiments, was used as the template to construct a cloning cassette. This template was chosen because a unique SalI site, 3′ of the mutagenic area, was created during the original mutagenesis. Megaprimer strategy was again utilized with primers SS196 and SS148 (Table I) creating a uniqueKpnI site 5′ of the mutagenic area. The megaproduct reaction utilized the megaprimer and SS224 (Table I). This 534-bp product was digested with PvuII and SalI and cloned into template T322S, thus creating a new template pETB-KS, containing a 126-bp cassette between the KpnI and SalI sites. pETB-KS was then used as the template to construct single random mutants of Thr-323 and Arg-325. SS148, containing the KpnI site and the corrected sequence for Thr-322, along with SS197 (Thr-323) or SS195 (Arg-325) were used to generate a 126-bp product which was cut by SalI and KpnI and cloned into pETB-KS digested with the same enzymes. Additional site-specific mutations were generated utilizing pETB-KS as a template and SS224 and SS351-SS363 and SS370 (Table I) to produce T322V, T322S, T322A, T323V, T323S, T323A, R325A, R325K, V321A, D320A, Y319A, T318A, E317A, and E317Q. The 534-bp product was digested withSalI and KpnI and cloned into pETB-KS digested with the same enzymes. The identity of mutated inserts generated by PCR and the adjoining cloning sites was confirmed by sequencing before protein expression. Several preliminary assays were performed to determine which AS-B mutants warranted further investigation. First, the solubility of the mutant protein was evaluated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Second, the soluble cellular fractions containing crude overexpressed AS-B or AS-B mutant enzymes were assayed by measuring the conversion of aspartate to asparagine as monitored by high performance liquid chromatography amino acid analysis on an Applied Biosystems 420A derivatizer and 130A separation system. Standard assay conditions were as follows: 100 mm NH4OAc or 10 mmglutamine, 10 mm ATP, 10 mml-aspartate, 17 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Reactions were initiated with 10 μl of crude extract and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min before being terminated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid, to a 4% final concentration, and filtered through a 0.2-μm syringe filter. All reactions were performed in duplicate. Procedures for the purification and expression of pETB and mutant enzymes have been described elsewhere (13Boehlein S.K. Richards N.G.J. Schuster S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7450-7457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with an assay kit supplied by Bio-Rad using γ-globulin to construct a standard curve. Apparent affinity constants (Km(app)) for AS-B substrates were determined by incubating purified wild-type or mutant AS-B in reaction mixtures (total volume 160 μl) in which all but one of the substrates were saturating, i.e. at approximately 10 times theirKm(app) value, unless otherwise noted. The highest aspartate concentration used in these experiments was 100 mm, so AS-B mutants for which the apparent aspartateKm(app) was greater than 10 mm were not saturated by this substrate. All assays contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 8 mmMgCl2, and the appropriate purified enzyme (3–15 μg). A 10-fold variation in substrate, centered aboutKm(app), was used to determine the effect of substrate concentration for both wild-type and mutant enzymes. The initial velocity of each reaction was determined spectrophotometrically by following the production of pyrophosphate during asparagine synthesis (Sigma, Technical Bulletin No. BI-100). Each assay was run two to four times, and the averages are presented. Rate and concentration data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to give Km(app) andVmax using the software program Graph Pad Prism (Graph Pad, San Diego, CA). The glutaminase activity of the AS-B mutants was assayed by measuring the formation of glutamate using the reaction of glutamate dehydrogenase in the presence of NAD+(24Bernt E. Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1974: 331-358Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (100 μl total volume) contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 8.0 mm MgCl2with varying concentrations of glutamine (0.5–10 mm). Reactions were initiated by the addition of purified wild-type AS-B or mutant enzyme (0.83 μg) and were incubated for 18 min before being terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 1 n AcOH. The reaction mixture was then added to 380 μl of the coupling reagent (300 mm glycine, 250 mm hydrazine, pH 9, 1 mm ADP, 1.6 mm NAD+, and 2.2 units of glutamate dehydrogenase) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The solution absorbance was measured at 340 nm, the amount of glutamate present being determined from a standard curve. Chemical rescue experiments were performed by incubating purified R325A (10.8 μg), R325K (13.5 μg), or wild type AS-B (3.9 μg) with 50 mm aspartate, 10 mmATP, 10 mm glutamine, 15 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and varying concentrations of guanidinium HCl (GdmHCl), methylamine, urea, thiourea, tetramethylguanidine, or methylguanidine (0.5–50 mm). Asparagine synthesis was quantified by measuring the amount of pyrophosphate released in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Independent high performance liquid chromatography experiments were employed to ensure that pyrophosphate and asparagine were formed in a 1:1 ratio under these reaction conditions. All assays were performed in triplicate. An initial evaluation of the functional importance of amino acid residues located in regions 317–330 and 484–500 was carried out using “directed random mutagenesis.” Oligonucleotides SS123 and SS124 (Table I), having a calculated average of two mismatches per oligonucleotide, were used to create the two sets of mutations. Twelve independent clones containing mutations in region 317–330,and 17 independent clones for region 484–500 were evaluated (Table II). Each of these clones was characterized by sequence determination of the inserts and measurement of glutaminase and asparagine synthetase activities in extracts of the expressed protein. Although random mutagenesis of region 484–500 gave eight double mutants, two triple mutants, and seven single mutants, representing a variety of conservative replacements (T489S, S492T, and F485L) and changes in local charge and potential structural modifications (P486L:T489K, R484D:E500K, T489K:E500K, and R484C:P486A:E500K), all of the associated proteins retained their ability to catalyze asparagine synthesis (Table II). We therefore conclude that residues 484–500 are not involved in direct catalysis and/or substrate binding.Table IIActivity of the AS-B mutants obtained using directed random mutagenesisMutantAS activity +/−MutantAS activity +/−Mutants with changes in the region defined by residues 317–330E317V−E317V:P329A−Y319F+Y319S:T322I−T322P−T322A:M330I−T322M−T322N:T323N−T322S+E317V:T322S:T323P−T328S+T318S:D320A:T323A−Mutants with changes in the region defined by residues 484–500F485L+P486L:T489K+F485C+R484D:E500K+P486R+P486L:E500K+Y487C+T489K:E500K+T489S+T489M:E500K+S492T+T491S:E500K+E494Q+R484C:P486A:E500K+F485L:S492C+N488I:T491P:A495F+P486L:N488D+ Open table in a new tab In contrast, of the six mutant enzymes associated with single mutations in region 317–330, three were unable to synthesize asparagine, and of the six mutants containing multiple alterations in their sequence, none had detectable AS activity (Table II). All of these mutants were soluble and retained their ability to catalyze glutamine hydrolysis (data not shown), suggesting that gross conformational changes were not responsible for the concurrent loss of synthetase activity. Three AS-B single mutants retaining synthetase activity (Y319F, T322S, and T328S) were then purified according to standard procedures (13Boehlein S.K. Richards N.G.J. Schuster S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7450-7457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and kinetic constants for their glutaminase (Table III) and synthetase (Tables IV and V) activities were determined. The synthetase activity of site-specific mutants was fully characterized only if the mutant AS-B exhibited essentially unaltered kinetic parameters for glutaminase activity, in the presence and absence of ATP, relative to wild-type enzyme. The observation of unchanged ATP-dependent stimulation of glutaminase activity provided additional evidence that the ATP-binding site was likely unchanged by the mutation. In the case of all three AS-B mutants, the kinetic parameters for glutamine hydrolysis were comparable to those of the wild-type enzyme. On the other hand, although three of these site-specific AS-B mutant enzymes had similar specificity constants, measured as kcat/Km, to those of wild-type AS-B for all substrates, a substantial decrease inkcat andKm(app) for ATP was observed in the glutamine synthetase activity of the T322S mutant.Table IIIKinetic constants for the glutaminase activity of wild-type AS-B and AS-B mutantsMutantGlutamine + 5 mmATPGlutamine onlyKmkcatkcat/KmKmkcatkcat/Kmmms −1m −1 s −1mms −1m −1 s −1wt AS1.39 ± 0.071.38 ± 0.029931.94 ± 0.180.80 ± 0.03412E317A6.12 ± 0.450.59 ± 0.01968.44 ± 0.480.64 ± 0.0176E317Q2.60 ± 0.070.18 ± 0.004694.01 ± 0.350.18 ± 0.00445T318A1.04 ± 0.081.30 ± 0.0312501.45 ± 0.171.23 ± 0.05848Y319A1.15 ± 0.101.24 ± 0.0310781.23 ± 0.210.38 ± 0.02309Y319F1.03 ± 0.091.0 ± 0.029681.20 ± 0.100.67 ± 0.02556D320A1.89 ± 0.181.49 ± 0.057883.14 ± 0.331.35 ± 0.06430V321A1.11 ± 0.061.16 ± 0.0210451.51 ± 0.271.06 ± 0.06702T322A1.34 ± 0.081.49 ± 0.0311121.39 ± 0.190.97 ± 0.04698T322S1.23 ± 0.081.60 ± 0.0313011.42 ± 0.161.12 ± 0.04789T322V1.21 ± 0.071.72 ± 0.0314211.78 ± 0.221.34 ± 0.06753T322Y0.90 ± 0.070.57 ± 0.016331.11 ± 0.100.44 ± 0.01396T323A0.98 ± 0.050.86 ± 0.018781.38 ± 0.080.77 ± 0.01558T323I0.71 ± 0.040.74 ± 0.0110420.95 ± 0.070.54 ± 0.01568T323L0.94 ± 0.090.79 ± 0.028401.57 ± 0.200.80 ± 0.03510T323S0.84 ± 0.110.74 ± 0.038811.64 ± 0.160.69 ± 0.02610T323V1.14 ± 0.101.11 ± 0.039741.37 ± 0.190.94 ± 0.04686R325A1.59 ± 0.250.77 ± 0.044842.52 ± 0.160.84 ± 0.02333R325K0.91 ± 0.050.71 ± 0.017801.43 ± 0.140.70 ± 0.02490T328S0.92 ± 0.040.71 ± 0.017722.18 ± 0.260.49 ± 0.02225All initial rates were determined measuring glutamate production in a coupled assay.

https://openalex.org/W2035096705,"Stable human cell lines expressing the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-I) Nef protein from inducible promoters were used to analyze the phosphorylation status of Nefin vivo. Nef phosphorylation in both HeLa and Jurkat cells was stimulated by phorbol ester treatment. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed a predominance of phosphoserine with a small proportion of phosphothreonine. Treatment of cells with selective protein kinase inhibitors revealed that Nef phosphorylation was markedly reduced by bisindolylmaleimide, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, but was unaffected by inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase or cAMP-dependent kinase. These data implicate protein kinase C in Nef phosphorylation in vivo, and thus confirm and extend earlier in vitro data. Phosphorylation of a nonmyristoylated Nef mutant was impaired, suggesting that membrane targeting of Nef was required for phosphorylation. This was expected given that activated protein kinase C translocates from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. However, analysis of the subcellular localization of phosphorylated wild-type Nef revealed that both the cytosolic and membrane-associated pools of Nef were phosphorylated to an equivalent extent. Thus the significance of myristoylation for Nef function may be in influencing protein conformation, although these data could be explained by a transient and dynamic interaction between myristoylated Nef and the plasma membrane.

Nef protein is a 206-amino acid polypeptide co-translationally modified at the N terminus by the addition of a myristate residue (1Allan J.S. Coligan J.E. Lee T. McLane M.F. Kanki P.J. Groopman J.E. Essex M. Science. 1985; 230: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This modification is, at least in part, responsible for the association of a proportion of Nef with cellular membranes (2Kaminchik J. Bashan N. Itach A. Sarver N. Gorecki M. Panet A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 583-588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Yu G. Felsted R.L. Virology. 1992; 187: 46-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Nef has been shown to have a number of biological functions in vitro that may be pertinent to its role in disease. In particular the presence of Nef in HIV-I-infected cells enhances the production of infectious virions (4Miller M.D. Warmerdam M.T. Gaston I. Greene W.C. Feinberg M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 5Spina C.A. Kwoh T.J. Chowers M.Y. Guatelli J.C. Richman D.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), and this has been recently shown to involve the incorporation of Nef into the virus particle and its subsequent cleavage by the viral protease (6Welker R. Kottler H. Kalbitzer H.R. Krausslich H.G. Virology. 1996; 219: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar,7Pandori M.W. Fitch N.J.S. Craig H.M. Richman D.D. Spina C.A. Guatelli J.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However the precise biochemical mechanisms underpinning the enhanced infectivity of Nef+ virions remains to be defined. Nef expression also results in the down-modulation of CD4 from the cell surface (8Guy B. Kieny M.P. Riviere Y. Le Peuch C. Dott K. Girard M. Montagnier L. Lecocq J. Nature. 1987; 330: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 9Garcia J.V. Miller A.D. Nature. 1991; 350: 508-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), and this function is apparently independent of its role in enhancing viral infectivity (10Goldsmith M.A. Warmerdam M.T. Atchison R.E. Miller M.D. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4112-4121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nef-mediated down-modulation of CD4 results from increased rates of CD4 endocytosis and lysosomal targeting/degradation (11Aiken C. Konner J. Landau N.R. Lenburg M.E. Trono D. Cell. 1994; 76: 853-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 12Rhee S.S. Marsh J.W. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5156-5163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Schwartz O. DautryVarsat A. Goud B. Marechal V. Subtil A. Heard J. Danos O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 528-533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although again the precise biochemical mechanisms remain obscure. Finally Nef has been reported to have effects on signal transduction pathways both in lymphocytes and other cell types (14Niederman T.M.J. Hastings W.R. Luria S. Bandres J.C. Ratner L. Virology. 1993; 194: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Bandres J.C. Ratner L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3243-3249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Niederman T.M. Garcia J.V.

In this context effects of Nef on induction of interleukin-2 synthesis have been observed by some workers (18Luria S. Chambers I. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5326-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 19Collette Y. Chang H.L. Cerdan C. Chambost H. Algarte M. Mawas C. Imbert J. Burny A. Olive D. J.

Virol. 1995; 69: 1842-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but there is little agreement in this area as to the precise effects of Nef and the potential role of this aspect of Nef function in viral replication is currently unclear. In an attempt to unravel the biochemical mechanisms of Nef function, a number of groups have analyzed the cellular proteins with which Nef interacts, both in vitro and in vivo. A significant proportion of these Nef-interacting proteins have been identified as protein kinases of both the tyrosine and serine/threonine families. A proline-rich motif (amino acids 70–79) has been shown to interact with the SH3 domains of the Src family tyrosine kinases Hck (21Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 22Lee C.H. Leung B. Lemmon M.A. Zheng J. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Saksela K.

McPhee D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6701-6708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition a peptide corresponding to this motif inhibited the in vitro binding of Nef to MAP kinase (20Greenway A. Azad A. McPhee D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1842-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Greenway A. Azad A. Mills J. McPhee D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6701-6708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of Nef to both Lck and MAP kinase has been shown to inhibit kinase activity (23Collette Y. Dutartre H. Benziane A. Ramos-Morales F. Benarous R. Harris M. Olive D. J. Biol.

Nef has also been shown to associate with a 65K serine/threonine kinase that has been shown to be a member of the p21-associated kinase family (25Luo T.C. Garcia J.V. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6493-6496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Nunn M.F. Marsh J.W. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6157-6161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and recently an association between Nef and PKC θ has been reported (27Smith B.L. Krushelnycky B.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16753-16757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, none of these associations has been shown to result in the phosphorylation of Nef by the interacting kinase. An early study demonstrated that Nef was phosphorylated in recombinant vaccinia virus-infected BHK21 cells and that this phosphorylation could be stimulated by treatment of cells with phorbol ester (8Guy B.

This study also showed that partially purified bacterially expressed Nef could be phosphorylated in vitro by purified PKC. We (28Coates K. Harris M. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and others (29Bodeus M. Marie-Cardine A. Bougeret C. Ramos-Morales F. Benarous R. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1337-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have subsequently extended the latter observation, demonstrating that bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase-Nef fusion proteins purified to homogeneity on glutathione-agarose beads could be phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues, both by purified PKC and PKC present in lysates from mammalian cells. We now demonstrate that Nef expressed in human HeLa and Jurkat cells is phosphorylated in vivo. This phosphorylation was stimulated by phorbol ester treatment of cells and was inhibited by a selective PKC inhibitor, but not by inhibitors of MAP kinase kinase or cAMP-dependent kinase. Phosphorylation of Nef did not demonstrate an absolute dependence on association of Nef with cytoplasmic membranes as a nonmyristoylated mutant was also phosphorylated, albeit with reduced efficiency. Additionally, phosphorylation did not affect the observed distribution of Nef between cytosolic and membrane fractions, as both populations of Nef were equally efficiently phosphorylated. The construction of HeLa and Jurkat cells expressing Nef from tetracycline- or heavy metal-responsive promoters has been described previously (30Cooke S.J. Coates K. Barton C.H. Biggs T.E. Barrett S.J. Cochrane A. Oliver K. McKeating J.A. Harris M.P.G. Mann D.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Construction of the nonmyristoylated Nef mutant has been described (31Harris M. Coates K. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in DMEM (HeLa) or RPMI 1640 (Jurkat) containing 10% fetal calf serum, supplemented with 1 μg/ml tetracycline in the case of the HeLa cells to repress the tet-responsive promoter (32Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar). All chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma, with the exception of 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride-HCl (AEBSF), bisindolylmaleimide-HCl (BIM), and 2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone (PD98059), which were purchased from Calbiochem. The myristoylated PKIα inhibitor peptide was a kind gift from Roger Clegg (Hannah Research Institute, Ayr, Scotland). For phosphorylation assays HeLa cells were seeded in 50-mm dishes at 5 × 105 cells/dish in the absence of tetracycline. After 40 h, monolayers were washed once in DMEM without sodium phosphate but supplemented with 1% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Cells were then incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in 2 ml of labeling medium containing 200 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Corp.) to equilibrate the intracellular ATP pools with labeled phosphate, prior to treatment with 100 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 30 min. For experiments involving kinase inhibitors, the inhibitors were added at the same time as the label and were thus present throughout the labeling period. Monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested into 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm EDTA. Cell pellets were lysed in 500 μl of 10 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, 120 mmKCl, 30 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol containing 100 nm okadiac acid, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.2 mm AEBSF for 30 min at 4 °C. Jurkat cells were treated similarly except that 2.5 × 107 cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence of 100 μm ZnCl2 prior to labeling. Unlabeled lysates (for immunoblotting) were processed in parallel. Labeling with [35S]methionine was carried out for 4 h in DMEM without methionine but supplemented with 1% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Tran35S-label >1000Ci/mmol, ICN). Labeling with3H-labeled myristic acid was carried out for 16 h in complete DMEM supplemented with 1% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 200 μCi/ml 3H-labeled myristic acid (40–60 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.). Myristic acid (supplied in ethanol) was dried down under vacuum and resuspended in Me2SO to a final volume of 1% of the labeling medium. Lysates were adjusted to 0.5 m KCl and precleared by the addition of 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads and incubation on a rotating platform for 2 h at 4 °C. Nef was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C by the addition of a murine monoclonal antibody specific for the N-terminal 7 amino acids of Nef (3 μl of ascitic fluid). 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads were added (in 50 μl of lysis buffer) and incubated for a further 4 h at 4 °C on a rotating platform. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer containing 0.5m KCl and once in lysis buffer prior to addition of 20 μl of 1 × boiling buffer (0.8% SDS, 8% glycerol, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), analysis by 15% SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography. For immunoblotting gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Immobilon P) using a Bio-Rad semidry blotting apparatus. After blocking in TBS-T (25 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) containing 10% (w/v) dried skimmed milk, membranes were sequentially probed with a sheep polyclonal Nef serum (1:10000) and donkey anti-sheep horseradish peroxidase (Sigma), prior to visualization by enhanced chemoluminescence (Amersham Corp.). Cells were harvested as described above and fractionated by hypotonic lysis and Dounce homogenization essentially as described previously (31Harris M. Coates K. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were resuspended in 10 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, 0.5 mmMgCl2, swollen on ice for 10 min, and homogenized by 30 strokes with a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer. The suspension was adjusted to 120 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, and spun at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant from that spin was then spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting clarified supernatant was termed cytosol, and the pellet (membrane fraction) was washed in lysis buffer without Triton X-100 and resuspended in lysis buffer. All buffers contained protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described above. Immunoprecipitates were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The area of the membrane corresponding to the phosphorylated Nef band was identified following overnight autoradiography, excised, and hydrolyzed in 5.7 n HCl at 110 °C for 1 h. The sample was lyophilized and analyzed by two-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis on cellulose plates (Eastman Kodak Co.), in the first dimension at pH 1.9 and in the second dimension at pH 3.5. Unlabeled phosphoamino acid standards (0.5 μg each) were visualized by ninhydrin staining. We have previously described the construction of stable cell lines expressing Nef from inducible promoters (30Cooke S.J. Coates K. Barton C.H. Biggs T.E. Barrett S.J. Cochrane A. Oliver K. McKeating J.A. Harris M.P.G. Mann D.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Stable HeLa cell lines were generated using a derivative of the tetracycline responsive system originally developed by Gossen and Bujard (32Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar) in which the components of the system were cloned into the pREP series of episomal vectors. This system proved to be unsuitable for regulated Nef expression in Jurkat cells as expression was constitutive, so in these cells Nef was expressed from a modified metallothionein promoter (33Makarov S.S. Jonat C. Haskill S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1504-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 demonstrates the inducibility of Nef expression in these cells. HeLa cells were incubated with and without tetracycline (1 μg/ml), and Jurkat cells were treated with 100 μmZnCl2 for 24 h prior to harvesting and analysis of Nef expression by immunoblotting. In both cases Nef expression can be induced at least 10-fold. In all the phosphorylation experiments described subsequently Nef expression was induced either by growth in the absence of tetracycline (HeLa cells) or in the presence of 100 μm ZnCl2 (Jurkat cells). Our previous results indicated that Nef could be phosphorylated in vitro by kinases present in extracts of HeLa or Jurkat cells (28Coates K. Harris M. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To extend this result and to examine whether Nef could be phosphorylated under physiological conditions, HeLa and Jurkat cells expressing Nef were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and lysates were immunoprecipitated with a Nef-specific murine monoclonal antibody. Fig. 2 a demonstrates that in HeLa cell lysates a 28-kDa phosphorylated band corresponding to Nef was immunoprecipitated by the Nef monoclonal antibody from cells expressing Nef but not from control cells stably transfected with an empty vector. Phosphorylation of this species was stimulated at least 8-fold (as judged by densitometry of autoradiographs) by treatment of cells with 100 ng/ml PMA for 30 min. Fig. 2 b demonstrates that phosphorylation of Nef expressed in Jurkat T cells was also stimulated by PMA treatment of the cells. Fig. 2 c shows an immunoblot of immunoprecipitates from unlabeled lysates, demonstrating that similar levels of Nef were present in lysates from cells, independently of PMA treatment. Thus the increase in phosphate labeling apparent in the presence of PMA is not due to an increase in Nef expression levels, but rather by phosphorylation of preexisting Nef molecules. The high molecular weight phosphorylated proteins present in each lane of Fig.2, a and b, represent cellular phosphoproteins that bound nonspecifically to protein G-Sepharose beads. Identical profiles of these proteins were seen in immunoprecipitates from control and Nef-expressing cells (for example compare Fig. 2 a,lanes 1 and 3) and were also seen in control precipitations carried out using antibodies to unrelated proteins or protein G-Sepharose beads alone (data not shown). In vitro data demonstrated that Nef phosphorylation by kinases present in cell extracts occurred predominantly on serine residues; however, phosphothreonine could also be detected at much lower abundance (28Coates K. Harris M. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our preliminary analysis of Nef immunoprecipitated from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled HeLa-Nef cells revealed that Nef phosphorylation was entirely alkali-labile and thus consisted of phosphoserine and/or phosphothreonine (data not shown). To define the identity of the phosphoamino acids precisely, Nef immunoprecipitates from PMA-treated HeLa-Nef cells were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the radiolabeled bands corresponding to Nef were excised and analyzed by hydrolysis in 5.7 n HCl followed by two-dimensional thin-layer electrophoresis. Fig. 3demonstrates that, in common with the earlier in vitro data, Nef was phosphorylated principally on serine, although phosphothreonine was also detected. Identical results were obtained after phosphoamino acid analysis of phosphorylated Nef expressed in Jurkat cells (data not shown). Both the conventional and novel groups of protein kinase C isoforms are activated by binding to phorbol esters (34Stabel S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 277-284PubMed Google Scholar). The observation in Fig. 2 that phosphorylation of Nef was stimulated by PMA treatment suggested that PKC may either directly phosphorylate Nef or phosphorylate and activate a distinct kinase that subsequently phosphorylates Nef. A number of other lines of evidence point to PKC as a direct effector of Nef phosphorylation; in vitro data from a number of laboratories has indicated that purified PKC can phosphorylate purified Nef (8Guy B. Kieny M.P. Riviere Y. Le Peuch C. Dott K. Girard M. Montagnier L. Lecocq J. Nature. 1987; 330: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 28Coates K. Harris M. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 29Bodeus M. Marie-Cardine A. Bougeret C. Ramos-Morales F. Benarous R. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1337-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and in addition our previous data demonstrated that only kinase inhibitors selective for PKC suppressed Nef phosphorylation in vitro by kinases present in cell extracts (28Coates K. Harris M. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To investigate whether PKC plays a role in Nef phosphorylation in vivo HeLa and Jurkat cells expressing Nef were treated with a number of selective kinase inhibitors, prior to PMA stimulation and analysis of Nef phosphorylation. As shown in Fig.4 treatment of cells with a cell-soluble inhibitor of PKC, BIM, dramatically reduced the levels of PMA-induced Nef phosphorylation in comparison to the level of phosphorylation detectable in the absence of inhibitor. Neither PD98059, a synthetic inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase (35Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2586) Google Scholar), or a myristoylated peptide inhibitor of cAMP-dependent kinase, corresponding to residues 5–24 of the heat-stable inhibitor PKIα (36Thomas J. Van Patten S.M. Howard P. Day K.H. Mitchell R.D. Sosnick T. Trewhella J. Walsh D.A. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10906-10911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had any significant effect. These data confirm the relevance of our previousin vitro data and attest to a role for PKC in Nef phosphorylation in vivo. As PKC is known to translocate from the cytosol to the plasma membrane once activated by phorbol ester binding, it was conceivable that phosphorylation would require membrane localization of Nef. Myristoylation is absolutely required for the stable association of Nef with a cytoplasmic membrane fraction, therefore HeLa and Jurkat cells expressing a nonmyristoylated Nef mutant (Gly2 → Ser) were utilized to address this question. To confirm that this mutant was indeed nonmyristoylated, HeLa cells were metabolically labeled with either [3H]myristate or [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitated using the N-terminal-specific Nef monoclonal antibody. Fig. 5 a shows that this Nef mutant could be labeled with [35S]methionine, but failed to incorporate [3H]myristate. In contrast wild-type Nef was myristoylated as demonstrated by the incorporation of [3H]myristate. The intracellular localization of the wild-type and nonmyristoylated Nef proteins was analyzed by subcellular fractionation of HeLa cells expressing each protein. Cytosolic and membrane-associated fractions of these cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with a Nef specific sheep polyclonal serum (Fig.5 b). The data confirm that a proportion of wild-type Nef molecules was stably associated with the membrane fraction; however, it is clear that more than 50% of myristoylated Nef molecules remained cytosolic. In comparison the nonmyristoylated Nef mutant failed to associate with the membrane fraction and was exclusively cytosolic. Identical results were obtained for expression and localization of the wild-type and nonmyristoylated Nef mutant in Jurkat cells (data not shown). HeLa and Jurkat cells expressing wild-type and nonmyristoylated Nef were then labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and Nef phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoprecipitation. Fig.6 a demonstrates that a phosphorylated species corresponding to the nonmyristoylated Nef mutant could be detected; however, in comparison with wild-type Nef the extent of phosphorylation was clearly greatly reduced. Unlabeled extracts immunoprecipitated in parallel and analyzed by immunoblotting revealed that comparable amounts of the two Nef species were present in immunoprecipitates (Fig.6 b), although it should be noted that in the HeLa cell lines the nonmyristoylated mutant was expressed at a lower level than the wild-type (see Fig. 5 a). Thus it is clear that, although phosphorylation does not demonstrate an absolute requirement for myristoylation, the latter modification greatly enhances the ability of Nef to function as a phosphorylation substrate. It has been reported that the distribution of some myristoylated proteins such as MARCKS (37Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) and HIV-I p17Gag (38Zhou W. Parent L.J. Wills J.W. Resh M.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2556-2569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is regulated by phosphorylation. These proteins are stably anchored into the plasma membrane by a combination of myristoylation and electrostatic interactions between basic amino acids and acidic phospholipids. Phosphorylation results in their dissociation from the membrane by electrostatic repulsion. To investigate whether this situation might also apply to Nef, HeLa cells expressing wild-type Nef were labeled with either [32P]orthophosphate or [35S]methionine and fractionated into cytosolic and cytoplasmic membrane fractions prior to immunoprecipitation. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 7; it can clearly be seen that the majority of both [32P]orthophosphate (Fig. 7 a) or [35S]methionine (Fig. 7 b) labeled Nef was present in the soluble fraction. Thus it appears that both the cytosolic and membrane-associated populations of Nef were phosphorylated to an equivalent extent, indicating that phosphorylation of Nef does not grossly influence its subcellular localization. Furthermore these data imply that stable membrane association of myristoylated Nef is not required for phosphorylation, with the proviso that the interaction between Nef and the membrane may be transient and therefore dynamic. In this study we report that the HIV-I Nef protein can be phosphorylated in vivo by a cellular serine/threonine protein kinase, and we present evidence to suggest that this phosphorylation is mediated by members of the PKC family. The evidence for the latter statement is 2-fold. First, Nef phosphorylation is stimulated by treatment of Nef expressing cells with the phorbol ester PMA, a well characterized activator of PKC (Fig. 2 a). Second, Nef phosphorylation was reduced by a selective PKC inhibitor, BIM, but not by inhibitors of cAMP-dependent kinase or MAP kinase kinase (Fig. 4). Although previous in vitro data both from our laboratory and others have indicated that purified PKC can directly phosphorylate recombinant Nef in the absence of other cellular factors (8Guy B. Kieny M.P. Riviere Y. Le Peuch C. Dott K. Girard M. Montagnier L. Lecocq J. Nature. 1987; 330: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 28Coates K. Harris M. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), it cannot be ruled out that in vivo PKC acts indirectly to induce Nef phosphorylation by activating a distinct protein kinase. In this regard it should be noted that BIM treatment did not completely abrogate phosphorylation of Nef, but merely reduced it to levels comparable to those observed in unstimulated cells (in the absence of PMA). One explanation for this observation is that the constitutive phosphorylation of Nef is mediated by a distinct kinase activity that is itself stimulated by PKC. Activation of PKC by phorbol ester binding is concomitant with its translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane where it inserts into the lipid bilayer (34Stabel S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 277-284PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of PKC substrates are thus transmembrane glycoproteins (e.g. epidermal growth factor, transferrin, and insulin receptors) or proteins associated with the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane (e.g. MARCKS, c-Src, Raf-1). The observation that Nef phosphorylation is enhanced by myristoylation (which is absolutely required for membrane association of Nef) could therefore be construed as further evidence that Nef is directly phosphorylated by PKC. However, two lines of evidence suggest that Nef phosphorylation was not absolutely dependent upon stable association with cytoplasmic membranes. First, the nonmyristoylated mutant was phosphorylated, albeit at a much lower level than wild-type (Fig. 6 a). Second, wild-type Nef present both in the cytosolic and membrane fractions was phosphorylated to an equivalent extent (Fig. 7). There are two simple explanations for these data. First, by analogy with the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent kinase (40Zheng J. Knighton D.R. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Eyck L.F.T. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1559-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), myristoylation might influence the tertiary structure of the protein such that a PKC site(s) was exposed. In support of this conjecture structural studies of bacterially expressed Nef have indicated that the nonmyristoylated N-terminal domain lacked any defined structure (41Grzesiek S. Bax A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Hu J.S. Kaufman J. Palmer I. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 42Lee C. Saksela K. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 85: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation might therefore be occurring independently of membrane association, and the enhancement by myristoylation would merely reflect altered conformation of the protein. Second, the interaction between Nef and the membrane might be dynamic; however, in contrast to proteins such as MARCKS and c-Src (43Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) the data presented here suggest that association of Nef with the membrane is not dynamically regulated by phosphorylation. The data in Fig. 3 demonstrate that both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine could be detected in immunoprecipitates of phosphorylated Nef, although the major component was phosphoserine. Two studies have reported tyrosine phosphorylation of both HIV-I (23Collette Y. Dutartre H. Benziane A. Ramos-Morales F. Benarous R. Harris M. Olive D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6333-6341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and simian immunodeficiency virus Nef (44Du Z. Lang S.M. Sasseville V.G. Lackner A.A. Ilyinskil P.O. Daniel M.D. Jung J.U. Desrosiers R.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 665-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar); however, in these experiments described here we found no evidence for the presence of phosphotyrosine in phosphorylated Nef species. In repeated experiments phosphoserine was invariably detected; however, phosphothreonine was not always present. It is possible therefore that phosphothreonine might represent a contaminating cellular protein, as in some experiments a phosphorylated protein co-migrating with Nef was observed following prolonged exposures of immunoprecipitations with the Nef-specific monoclonal antibody from control cells (data not shown). The identity of the phosphorylated serines/threonines in Nef remains to be established. Residues phosphorylated by PKC tend to be preceded and/or followed by arginine or lysine residues (45Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 342-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), there are a number of serine residues and one threonine in the BH10 Nef allele used in this study (46Harris M. Hislop S. Patsilinacos P. Neil J.C. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1992; 8: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 47Shugars D.C. Smith M.S. Glueck D.H. Nantermet P.V. Seillier-Moiseiwitsch F. Swanstrom R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4639-4650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that fulfil these criteria and therefore constitute potential PKC phosphorylation sites. It is important to note that an early study suggested that Nef was phosphorylated by PKC exclusively on threonine 15 (8Guy B. Kieny M.P. Riviere Y. Le Peuch C. Dott K. Girard M. Montagnier L. Lecocq J. Nature. 1987; 330: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar); however, the BH10 allele of Nef used in this study has a substitution of alanine for threonine 15, so this residue is clearly not absolutely required for PKC phosphorylation of Nef in vivo. Experiments are presently underway to identify the sites of phosphorylation by site-directed mutagenesis and phosphopeptide mapping. Our previous data have demonstrated that the nef allele used in this study (BH10) encodes a protein functionally active in both HeLa and Jurkat cells, as judged by a number of criteria including enhancement of viral infectivity (30Cooke S.J. Coates K. Barton C.H. Biggs T.E. Barrett S.J. Cochrane A. Oliver K. McKeating J.A. Harris M.P.G. Mann D.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), CD4 down-modulation (30Cooke S.J. Coates K. Barton C.H. Biggs T.E. Barrett S.J. Cochrane A. Oliver K. McKeating J.A. Harris M.P.G.

Mann, and M. P. G. Harris, manuscript in preparation. It is likely, therefore, that phosphorylation plays a role in the function of Nef. That role remains elusive; however, one immediate functional consequence is that phosphorylation will influence the interactions between Nef and cellular proteins. There are many pertinent examples of phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interactions, for example MARCKS binding to calmodulin is inhibited by PKC phosphorylation (37Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), and in some instances phosphoserine has been implicated in phosphotyrosine-independent interactions with SH2 domains (48Cleghon V. Morrison D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17749-17755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Raffel G.D. Parmar K. Rosenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4640-4645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Further insights into the functional consequences of Nef phosphorylation must await the results of future experiments with mutated genes.

To investigate the mechanism of interferon-α (IFN-α)-mediated growth suppression of hematopoietic cells, we examined the effect of IFN-α on the expression and function of E2F using IFN-sensitive Daudi cells. Down-regulation of E2F-1, a subunit of E2F, was observed after 8 h of culture with IFN-α; expression of E2F-4, another subunit of E2F, and DP-1, a heterodimeric partner of E2F, was unaffected. Gel shift assays revealed that the DNA binding activity of free E2F, which is composed of E2F-1 and E2F-4, was inhibited by IFN-α. In contrast, IFN-α did not affect the DNA binding ability of E2F-1 and E2F-4 in a complex with retinoblastoma (RB) susceptibility gene family proteins including pRB, p107, and p130. IFN-α could induce dephosphorylation of pRB, thereby turning active E2F-pRB complexes into transcriptional repressors. Transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays revealed that the activity of the E2F-dependent cdc2promoter was suppressed by IFN-α. These results suggest that the antiproliferative action of IFN-α is mediated through the modulation of E2F activity in two different ways: down-regulation of transcriptionally active free E2F and conversion of E2F-pRB complexes into transcriptional repressors.

It is well known that IFNs can effectively inhibit the growth of some types of hematopoietic cells, and now they have been used as a therapeutic reagent for a variety of hematological malignancies including chronic myeloid leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, and low grade B-cell lymphomas (3Mandelli F. Arcese W. Avvisatti G. Clin. Haematol. 1994; 7: 91-113Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although IFNs have an established status as a first-line drug for chronic myeloid leukemia and hairy cell leukemia, some problems remain unresolved, including drug resistance and numerous adverse effects. Insights into the molecular mechanisms of IFN action are helpful in resolving these problems. However, the mechanisms regulating the antiproliferative effect of IFNs have not been elucidated fully despite extensive investigations. Recent investigations revealed that IFNs can induce activation of a group of IFN-stimulated gene products including a double-stranded RNA-activable protein kinase (4Meurs E. Chong K. Galabru J. Thomas N.S.B. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Hovanessian A.G. Cell. 1990; 62: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar), the IFN regulatory factors IRF-1 and IRF-2 (5Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar), gene 200 cluster proteins (6Choubey D. Snoddy J. Chaturvedi V. Toniato E. Opdenakker G. Thakur A. Samanta H. Engel D.A. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17182-17189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and RNase L (7Zhou A. Hassel B.A. Silverman R.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 753-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Direct and indirect evidence indicates that several of these proteins may have tumor-suppressive activities. Among the growth-regulatory genes and gene products, IFNs are known to induce down-regulation of c-myc expression (8Einat M. Resnitzky D. Kimchi A. Nature. 1985; 313: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (RB) susceptibility gene product (9Resnitzky D. Tiefenbrun N. Berissi H. Kimchi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and inhibition of both the expression and activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (10Thomas N.S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13697-13700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yamada H. Ochi K. Nakada S. Nemoto T. Horiguchi-Yamada J. Mol. Cell.

Although the antiproliferative effect of IFN is thought to be mediated through these events, further investigation should be required to elucidate fully the direct mechanisms of its action. For example, it is difficult to determine whether these events are the cause of the growth arrest or simply a consequence of IFN-induced failure of cell cycle progression. Furthermore, through the study of transcriptional activation in response to IFNs, the direct involvement of Jak-Stat (Janus kinases-signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathways in signal transduction of IFNs has recently been proved (13Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). The role of the Jak-Stat system in IFN-mediated growth suppression of hematopoietic cells is not yet clarified. E2F is a heterodimeric transcription factor that was originally identified as an element needed for the E1A-dependent activation of a specific adenoviral E2 promoter (14Kovesdi I. Reichel R. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1986; 45: 219-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). E2F is composed of each member of the E2F and DP families. Currently, five distinct E2F family members (E2F-1 to E2F-5) and three DP proteins (DP-1 to DP-3) are known (15Müller R. Trend Genet. 1995; 11: 173-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). E2F-1 is the most characterized component of E2F and binds to DNA as a heterodimer with DP-1. Although DP-1 itself has little or no affinity for DNA, the association of E2F-1 and DP-1 leads to enhanced DNA binding and is required for E2F site-dependent transcriptional activation (16Helin K. Wu C.-L. Fattaey A.R. Lees J.A. Dynlacht B.D. Ngwu C. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1850-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). E2F binding sites were detected in the promoter regions of many growth-responsive or growth-promoting genes such as c-myc, c-myb,cdc2, and genes for dihydrofolate reductase, thymidine kinase, DNA polymerase-α, and cyclin A (17Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). The role of E2F in the transcriptional regulation of the c-myc, dihydrofolate reductase, and cdc2 genes has been confirmed (18Hiebert S.W. Lipp M. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3594-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 19Blake M.C. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4994-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 20Dalton S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1797-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Moreover, E2F is now considered to be a relevant target of RB family proteins including p107, p130, and RB protein (pRB) itself in their activity as growth suppressors (21Beijersbergen R.L. Bernards R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These observations strongly suggest that E2F can be a target of the action of growth-inhibitory factors such as IFNs and transforming growth factor-β. In this study, with this background in mind, investigations were carried out to clarify the involvement of E2F in IFN-induced growth suppression of hematopoietic cells. We have also studied the mechanisms of the inhibition of E2F activity by IFN-α with a special reference to its interaction with RB protein. Highly purified natural IFN-α derived from Sendai virus-infected Nawalwa cells (22Hu R. Gan Y. Liu J. Miller D. Zoon K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12591-12595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was provided by Sumitomo Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). 20 IFN-α components were included in this preparation with specific activities of 1.3 × 108–2.6 × 108 IU/mg of protein (22Hu R. Gan Y. Liu J. Miller D. Zoon K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12591-12595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Burkitt lymphoma cell line Daudi was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cellular DNA and RNA synthesis was monitored by pulse labeling the cells for a final 1 h of the culture with 5 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine and [3H]uridine (Amersham Corp.), respectively. Cell cycle distribution was determined by analyzing the samples of 106 cells stained with propidium iodide in a flow cytometry with FACScan/CellFIT system (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The following cDNA clones were used in this study: a 1.4-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment of humanE2F-1 cDNA (provided by Drs. William G. Kaelin, Jr., James A. DeCaprio, and David M. Livingston, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) (23Kaelin W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Lee Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K. Cell. 1992; 70: 351-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar); a 0.9-kb KpnI-PvuII fragment of human cdc2 cDNA (provided by Dr. Paul Nurse, Oxford University, Oxford, U. K.); a 1.8-kbClaI-EcoRI fragment of c-myc exon 3 cDNA (Oncor Inc., Gaithersburg, MD); and a 2.2-kbEcoRI-BamHI fragment of p53 cDNA (provided by Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank). A 1.3-kb full-length fragment of murine DP-1 cDNA and a 1.2-kb full-length fragment of human E2F-4 cDNA were generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction based on the published sequences, respectively (24Girling R.

Wydner K.L. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2665-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated by cesium chloride centrifugation using CS120FX ultracentrifuge and S100AT5 fixed-angle rotor (Hitachi Koki, Co. Ltd.). 10-μg samples were electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde, 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA, and blotted onto Hybond N+ synthetic nylon membranes (Amersham Corp.). The membranes were hybridized with each cDNA probe, which was labeled with [32P]dCTP (DuPont-NEN) with the oligonucleotide random priming method. Cells were washed with ice-cold TBS buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), and lysed in EBC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 200 mm sodium orthovanadate) containing protease inhibitors. An equal amount (150 μg) of the samples was separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters (Bio-Rad). After blocking in TBS buffer with 4% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Sigma), the membranes were incubated for 16 h with 1 μg/ml anti-pRB monoclonal antibody PMG3-245 (Pharmingen, San Diego). The membranes were developed as described previously (26Furukawa Y. Uenoyama S. Ohta M. Tsunoda A. Griffin J.D. Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17121-17127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For c-Myc protein detection, anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen) was used as a primary antibody, and the bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.). IFN-treated Daudi cells were incubated in methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 3 h. Then the cells were washed three times and lysed in EBC buffer. Incorporation of [35S]methionine was monitored by a scintillation counting of the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction. An equal amount (7.5 × 107 cpm) of the lysates was immunoprecipitated overnight with anti-E2F-1-specific monoclonal antibodies KH95 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and SQ41 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The signal was detected by fluorography. To monitor the efficiency of immunoprecipitation and the integrity of protein, the samples were subsequently immunoprecipitated with anti-β-actin antibody (Oncogene Science Inc., Uniondale, NY). Nuclear extract was prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. (27Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). 5-μg samples were incubated with approximately 0.5 ng (10,000 cpm) of32P-labeled DNA fragment containing the E2F binding site (5′-ATTTAAGTTTCGCGCCCTTTCTCAA-3′) in the presence of 1 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA in a final volume of 25 μl. Incubations were carried out at room temperature for 30 min in 20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel (0.15 × 16 × 20 cm; acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio, 86:1 w/w) in 0.25 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer at 4 °C. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the AP-1 binding site (5′-CTAGTGATGAGTCAGCCGGATC-3′) and E2F-1 site (shown above) were used for competition assays. For antibody perturbation experiments, 1 μg of each antibody was added to the above noted reaction mixture. Specific antibodies used in this study were as follows: anti-E2F-1, C-20; anti-E2F-4, C-108; anti-pRB, C36; anti-pRB, XZ55; anti-p107, SD9; and anti-p130, C-20 (all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology except C36 and XZ55 from Pharmingen). Densitometric analysis of the results was performed by a Shimazu flying spot scanner CS-9000 (Shimazu Seisakusyo, Tokyo, Japan). Whole cell lysates of Daudi cells (5 mg) were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with anti-pRB antibody C36 in IP-DOC buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors. Immune complexes were recovered on protein A-Sepharose beads and washed three times in IP-DOC buffer. The associated proteins were released by the addition of 16 μl of 0.8% deoxycholate and then neutralized with 4 μl of 6% Nonidet P-40 (28Moberg K. Starz M.A. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1436-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The supernatants (4 μl/assay) were used for E2F gel shift assays as described above. Plasmids were introduced into Daudi cells by electroporation as described previously (29Yamada H. Iwase S. Mohri M. Kufe D. Blood. 1991; 78: 1988-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (2 × 107 cells/transfection) were resuspended in 500 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% fetal calf serum with 40 μg of linearized plasmid DNA. Electropulse was delivered at 250 V, 960 microfarads by a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). The cells were placed on ice for 15 min, resuspended at 5 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, and split equally into two flasks. IFN-α was added into one of them at the final concentration of 100 IU/ml. Cell extracts were prepared after 24 h of the culture, and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (60Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). CAT activity was assayed with 50 μg of each sample. CAT assays were carried out according to the standard procedure, and the activities were measured quantitatively by a liquid scintillation counting (30Furukawa Y. Terui Y. Sakoe K. Ohta M. Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26249-26258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′-untranslated sequence of the cdc2promoter up to nucleotide −383 relative to the transcription start site was linked to the CAT gene in pCAT-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and was used as a reporter plasmid (30Furukawa Y. Terui Y. Sakoe K. Ohta M. Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26249-26258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pCAT-control vector (Promega), which contains SV40 promoter and enhancer sequences, was transfected simultaneously and used as a positive control. As a negative control, pCAT-basic vector containing the cdc2promoter (up to −383) with the mutated E2F binding site was used (30Furukawa Y. Terui Y. Sakoe K. Ohta M. Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26249-26258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All plasmids were purified by cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation, linearized by appropriate restriction enzymes, and purified again by ethanol precipitation before transfection. Each result was adjusted according to the value obtained with the transfection of pCAT-control vector into corresponding cells. Among hematopoietic cells, Daudi is the most sensitive to IFN and easily arrests in G0/G1phase of the cell cycle in response to a relatively low amount of IFN-α (31Yamada H. Shimoyama M. Gann. 1983; 74: 299-307PubMed Google Scholar). We first examined the effect of IFN-α on cell cycle distribution and DNA synthesis of Daudi cells. The cells were seeded at an initial concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml and grown in the absence or presence of 100 IU/ml IFN-α. The change of cell cycle distribution was monitored by serial analysis of the DNA histogram. The proportion of S phase was approximately 45% in untreated Daudi cells (Fig. 1 A, T-0). When they were cultured with IFN-α, the S phase fraction was decreased gradually and reached to 21% after 24 h of culture (Fig.1 A, T-24). Conversely, approximately 60% of the cells were found to be arrested in G0/G1 phase after 24 h. Cellular DNA synthesis, as determined by [3H]thymidine uptake, correlated well with the portion of the cells in S phase, i.e. it was suppressed to be about 40% of the untreated control at 24 h (Fig. 1 B). RNA synthesis was also suppressed by IFN-α in a similar manner (Fig.1 C). Using this culture system, we investigated the effect of IFN-α on E2F. Total cellular RNA was isolated from Daudi cells at various time points after IFN-α treatment, and the expression of E2F-1, E2F-4, and DP-1 mRNA was examined by Northern blot hybridization. In agreement with our previous observation (30Furukawa Y. Terui Y. Sakoe K. Ohta M. Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26249-26258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bothE2F-1 and DP-1 mRNA transcripts were detected readily in untreated Daudi cells, reflecting the proliferative state of the cells. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the amount ofE2F-1 mRNA decreased significantly after 8 h of culture with IFN-α. It is of note that [3H]thymidine incorporation, a sensitive marker of cell proliferation, was not suppressed at this time point (Fig. 2 B). This clearly indicates that down-regulation of E2F-1 mRNA is not a simple consequence of the growth arrest and may have a causative role in IFN-induced growth arrest. In striking contrast, the E2F-4mRNA level was unchanged during this culture period.DP-1 mRNA expression was also unaffected by the IFN treatment, although a minor decrease was observed after 8 h (Fig.2 A). Next, we examined the effect of IFN-α on de novo synthesis of the E2F-1 gene product by metabolic labeling and subsequent immunoprecipitation. IFN-treated Daudi cells were pulse labeled for 3 h with [35S]methionine, and whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-E2F-1-specific monoclonal antibodies to monitor the amount of a newly synthesizedE2F-1 protein. As a control, the samples were subsequently immunoprecipitated with anti-β-actin antibody. In accordance with the marked reduction of the amount of mRNA transcript, a newly synthesized E2F-1 protein was barely detected after 8 h of the treatment with IFN-α, whereas the amount of β-actin was unaffected (Fig. 3). A minor increase in E2F-1 protein was observed in untreated cells after 8 h of culture. This may be the result of a small increase in the amount of E2F-1 mRNA (see Fig.2 A) during spontaneous cell growth (see Fig.1 B). To investigate whether this reduction of the amount of E2F-1 protein affects the transcriptional activity of E2F, we first examined the DNA binding ability of E2F in IFN-treated Daudi cells. Nuclear extracts were prepared at various time points after IFN treatment and tested for E2F activity by gel retardation assays using an E2F consensus oligonucleotide from the adenovirus E2 promoter as a probe (32Cao L. Faha B. Dembski M. Tsai L.-H. Harlow E. Dyson N. Nature. 1992; 355: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, when the nuclear extract from untreated Daudi cells was used, multiple bands with retarded mobilities were resolved on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel. By oligonucleotide competition assays, seven distinct bands (designated as A to G) were found to be specific E2F complexes. These bands were considered to represent the baseline E2F activity of proliferating Daudi cells. Two other fast migrating bands were considered to be nonspecific, since they were not eliminated by the addition of 100 molar excess of unlabeled E2F oligonucleotide (indicated bystars in Fig. 4). Then we performed antibody perturbation experiments to identify the nature of each complex. Specific antibodies against E2F-1, E2F-4, pRB, p107, and p130 were included in the reaction mixture, and the E2F gel shift assay was carried out as above (Fig.4 B). The results were quantitated by densitometric analysis and are summarized in Table I. Given that any specific antibody against RB family proteins (pRB, p107, and p130) did not affect the intensity of the bands E, F, and G, these complexes represent so-called free E2F. Furthermore, anti-E2F-4- but not anti-E2F-1-specific antibody could eliminate band E completely, indicating that this band is composed mainly of E2F-4 (Fig.4 B). On the other hand, two faster migrating free E2F bands (F and G) were not supershifted by anti-E2F-4 antibody, but the signal intensities were slightly but significantly decreased in the presence of anti-E2F-1 antibody (Fig. 4 B and Table I). This suggests that complexes F and G contain E2F-1 and other components of the E2F family such as E2F-2 and E2F-3. Four other bands (A to D) were found to be complexes of E2F and RB family proteins. Anti-pRB antibody effectively supershifted both bands C and D, and the former was eliminated by anti-E2F-4. These results therefore indicate that band C represents a complex containing E2F-4 and pRB. In contrast, band D was not abolished by either anti-E2F-1 or anti-E2F-4, suggesting that other E2F family members such as E2F-2 and E2F-3 form a complex with pRB in D. Similarly, the complex A was found to contain E2F-4, p107, and p130. Complex B disappeared with the addition of anti-p130, but it was not affected by either anti-E2F-1 or anti-E2F-4. Thus, complex B may be composed of p130 and a member of the E2F family other than E2F-1 and E2F-4. E2F-5 is a strong candidate as the E2F molecule present in this complex, as suggested by recent investigations (33Sardet C. Vidal M. Cobrinik D. Geng Y. Onufryk C. Chen A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl.

Open table in a new tab The signal intensity of each band was quantitated by densitometric analysis of the autoradiogram shown in Fig. 4 B with that of upper nonspecific band (indicated by an asterisk) setting at 1.0. The effect of IFN-α on E2F activity was analyzed next by comparing the intensities of these bands before and after treatment. Fig.5 A displays the representative result of gel retardation assays with nuclear extracts from Daudi cells isolated after 0, 8, and 24 h of culture with 100 IU/ml IFN-α. The intensity of bands F and G (corresponding to free E2F-1) was decreased significantly by IFN-α after 8 h of IFN treatment, which is consistent with the reduction of E2F-1 mRNA and protein. After 24 h, the amounts of free E2F-1 were reduced to approximately 25% of the untreated control by densitometric comparison. The abundance of the band E, which corresponds to free E2F-4, was unaltered at 8 h but was reduced markedly after 24 h of treatment (Fig.5 A). IFN also reduced the amounts of E2F-pRB complexes (C and D) and the E2F-4-p107 complex (A). The decrease in the E2F-p107 complex may correspond to the reduction of S phase cells by IFN, since this complex was reported to be preferentially formed in S phase (35Shirodkar S. Ewen M. DeCaprio J.A. Morgan J. Livingston D.M. Chittenden T. Cell. 1992; 68: 157-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Next, we performed an immunoprecipitation-deoxycholate release assay to confirm that E2F-4 really made a complex with pRB and also to see more precisely the effect of IFN on the E2F-4-pRB complex. pRB-associated proteins were immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates of Daudi cells before and after the IFN treatment, and E2F gel shift assays with antibody perturbation were carried out after deoxycholate release of the supernatants. As shown in Fig. 5 B, two bands (designated as X and Y) were observed, and both of them were eliminated completely by the cold competitor (lanes 2 and 6). Anti-E2F-4 antibody could reduce the intensity of band X, indicating that E2F-4 really is present in E2F-pRB complexes (lane 5). Similarly, E2F-1 was shown to be present in band Y (lane 4). There was no difference in the amounts of pRB-bound E2F between pre- and post-treatment samples (compare lanes 1 and3) despite the decrease in the intensities of E2F-pRB complexes (C and D in Fig. 5 A) in gel retardation assays. This suggests that E2F molecules associated with a single pRB molecule are not decreased even after the IFN treatment. This is fully consistent with the previous report by Melamed et al. (36Melamed D. Tiefenbrun N. Yarden A. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell.

Sequence analyses revealed the presence of three open reading frames (ORFs), designated as ORF-1, ORF-2, and ORF-3, and the structural genes of the heptaprenyl diphosphate synthase were proved to consist of ORF-1 (heps-1) and ORF-3 (heps-2) (Koike-Takeshita, A., Koyama, T., Obata, S., and Ogura, K. (1995)J. Biol. Chem. 270, 18396–18400). The predicted amino acid sequence of ORF-2 (234 amino acids) contains a methyltransferase consensus sequence and shows a 22% identity with UbiG ofEscherichia coli, which catalyzesS-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methylation of 2-octaprenyl-3-methyl-5-hydroxy-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone. These pieces of information led us to identify the ORF-2 gene product. The cell-free homogenate of the transformant of E. coli with an expression vector of ORF-2 catalyzed the incorporation ofS-adenosyl-l-methionine into menaquinone-8, indicating that ORF-2 encodes 2-heptaprenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone methyltransferase, which participates in the terminal step of the menaquinone biosynthesis. Thus it is concluded that the ORF-1, ORF-2, and ORF-3 genes, designated heps-1, menG, andheps-2, respectively, form another cluster involved in menaquinone biosynthesis in addition to the cluster ofmenB, menC, menD, andmenE already identified in the Bacillus subtilis and E. coli chromosomes.

Prenyltransferases catalyze the fundamental isoprenoid chain elongation to produce prenyl diphosphates with various chain lengths and stereochemistries, which are led to such diverse isoprenoid compounds as steroids, carotenoids, glycosyl carrier lipids, prenyl quinones, and prenyl proteins. Heptaprenyl diphosphate (HepPP) 1The abbreviations used are: HepPP, heptaprenyl diphosphate; MK, menaquinone; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; FPP, (E,E)-farnesyl diphosphate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ORF, open reading frame; SAM,S-adenosyl-l-methionine; 14C-SAM,S-adenosyl-l[methyl-14C]methionine. synthase is one of the three prenyl diphosphate synthases in Bacillus stearothermophilus. It catalyzes the condensations of four molecules of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) with farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to give HepPP, the precursor of the menaquinone (MK) side chain in this bacterium. MK, or 2-methyl-3-prenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, is a lipophilic nonprotein component of the electron transport chain in bacteria. In addition, MK is necessary for successful endospore formation and is involved in regulation of cytochrome formation in Bacillus subtilis (1Farrand S.K. Taber H.W. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 115: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MK is synthesized in bacteria from isochorismate through a series of MK-specific reactions (Fig. 1). Five MK biosynthetic genes, menA, menB, menC,menD, and menE, have been identified, and four of them are shown to be clustered on the chromosomes of Escherichia coli (2Guest J.R. Shaw D.J. Mol. & Gen.

Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 167: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported the cloning of the genes that encode the HepPP synthase of B. stearothermophilus (9Koike-Takeshita A. Koyama T. Obata S. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18396-18400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which is composed of two nonidentical protein components. Sequence analyses of the gene regions revealed the presence of three open reading frames designated as ORF-1, ORF-2, and ORF-3. After several deletion experiments, we concluded that the structural genes of the HepPP synthase were ORF-1 and ORF-3, designated heps-1 and heps-2, respectively. Then the next question is what is the function of ORF-2, which is located between the two structural genes of HepPP synthase. A data base search for proteins similar to the predicted product of ORF-2 (234 amino acids) indicated that the ORF-2 product contains the methyltransferase consensus sequence and shows a 69% identity with GerC2, whose gene is one of the genes in the gerC cluster ofB. subtilis, which is involved in spore germination (10Yazdi M.A. Moir A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), a 22% identity with UbiG of E. coli, which catalyzesS-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methylation of 2-octaprenyl-3-methyl-5-hydroxy-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (11Wu G. Williams H.D. Zamanian M. Gibson F. Poole R.K. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2101-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and a 37% identity with the O251 of E. coli, whose function is not yet known (12Daniels D.L. Plunkett G.3. Burland V. Blattner F.R. Science. 1992; 257: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To identify the function of ORF-2 as the 2-heptaprenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone methyltransferase gene, we constructed an expression system of ORF-2 and examined the enzymatic activity for catalysis of the terminal step in MK biosynthesis. This is the first report on the cloning of the gene encoding the methyltransferase catalyzing the terminal step in MK biosynthesis as well as on the existence of another gene cluster involved in MK biosynthesis. An E. coli mutant, AN70, is deficient of a specific methylase of the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway and is completely devoid of MK and contains high levels of demethylmenaquinone (22Wissenbach U. Ternes D. Unden G. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We also examined complementation of the growth of AN70 in M9 medium by the expression vector of o251. [1-14C]Isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP; 2.22 GBq/mmol) andS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine (14C-SAM; 2.29 GBq/mmol) were products of Amersham Corp. Nonlabeled IPP and FPP were synthesized according to the procedure of Davisson et al. (13Davisson V.J. Woodside A.B. Neal T.R. Stremler K.E. Muehlbacher M. Poulter C.D. J. Org. Chem. 1986; 51: 4768-4779Crossref Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Nonlabeled SAM was purchased from Sigma. Precoated reversed phase TLC plates (LKC-18) were products of Whatman. T4 DNA ligase and DNA polymerase were purchased from Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Restriction enzyme digestion, transformation, and other standard molecular biology techniques were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

E. coli K12 strain JM109 was used as the host to express the recombinant proteins.E. coli strains containing plasmid vectors conferring ampicillin resistance were maintained on Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. An E. coli strain AN70 used for complementation experiments was kindly supplied by Drs. G. Unden and I. Z. Young. The original cloning of the B. stearothermophilus HepPP synthase gene cluster, ORF-1 (heps-1), ORF-2, and ORF-3 (heps-2) in pT7 Blue-T vector as pTL6 was previously described (9Koike-Takeshita A.

To introduce aSphI site at 5′ end and a HindIII site at 3′ end of ORF-2, mutagenic oligonucleotide primers, 5′-AAGGGTAGAAGCATGCGTCAATCG-3′ (mismatched bases are underlined) and 5′-CATCGCCTTAAGCTTCATGTTGTTCACC-3′ were synthesized, respectively. Conditions for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were: 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 65°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 1 min, followed by extension at 72°C for 7 min. To a final volume of 100 μl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% (w/v) gelatin, 200 μm each of dNTPs, 100 pmol of the amplification primer pair, 1 unit of DNA polymerase enhancer (Stratagene), approximately 1 ng of pTL6, and 2 units of Taq polymerase were added. The PCR products were digested with SphI, treated with T4 DNA polymerase, and digested again with HindIII. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. Approximately 0.7-kilobase pair fragments were isolated, cloned into pTrc99A vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), which was digested with NcoI, treated with T4 DNA polymerase, and digested with HindIII. The resulting plasmid was designated pHE84. To introduce an NcoI site at 5′ end and a HindIII site at 3′ end of o251 of E. coli, mutagenic oligonucleotide primers, 5′-GAGCAGGCATTGCCATGGTGG-3′ (mismatched bases are underlined) and 5′-AAAAAGCTTTTCCGGTCTCC-3′ were synthesized. PCR was carried out under the same conditions as described above, using the genomic DNA from E. coli as the template. Then the PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel, purified, digested with NcoI and HindIII, and inserted into NcoI/HindIII site of pTrc99A. The resulting plasmid was designated pO251. Cells of E. coli containing plasmid pHE84 were grown at 37 °C toA600 of 0.6 to 0.8, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm to induce the expression of the ORF-2 product. After induction for 3 h the cells were collected by centrifugation and subjected to electrophoresis according to the standard method of Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar). E. coli cells were grown into late exponential phase in Luria-Bertani medium. The cells were centrifuged, suspended in a solution of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7, containing 1 mmEDTA and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (2 ml/g of wet cells), and disrupted with a Branson sonifier. The incubation mixture contained, in a total volume of 0.5 ml, 0.2 ml of crude homogenate of E. coli cells, 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 0.4% Triton X-100, 0.5 nmol of FPP, and 0.5 nmol of 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid in 1 μl of ethanol-diethyl ether (2:1, v/v). In addition, 0.47 nmol of [1-14C]IPP with 5 nmol of nonlabeled SAM or 0.5 nmol of nonlabeled IPP with 0.8 nmol of14C-SAM were added as substrates in reaction mixtures. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.5 ml of 0.1 m acetic acid in methanol. The reaction products were extracted with pentane (2 × 2 ml), analyzed by reversed phase TLC with a solvent system of acetone/water (19:1). The positions of authentic standards were visualized with iodine vapor, and the distribution of radioactivity was detected by autoradiography with a Fuji BAS 1000 Mac bioimage analyzer. Homology search revealed that the predicted amino acid sequence of ORF-2 contains the consensus sequence of some methyltransferases that require SAM as substrate (Fig.2) (16Ingrosso D. Fowler A.V. Bleibaum J. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20131-20139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DauC (27% identity) of Streptomyces sp. strain C5 catalyzes the methyl esterification of aklanonic acid in daunomycin biosynthesis (17Dickens M.L. Ye J. Strohl W.R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 536-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli UbiG (22% identity) catalyzes SAM-dependent methylation of 2-octaprenyl-3-methyl-5-hydroxy-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone, the terminal step in the ubiquinone biosynthesis (11Wu G. Williams H.D.

Rhodobacter sphaeroides PmtA (27% identity) catalyzes theN-methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (18Arondel V. Benning C. Somerville C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16002-16008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COQ3 (17% identity) catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from SAM to the 3-hydroxyl of 3,4-dihydroxy-5-hexaprenylbenzoate in ubiquinone biosynthesis (19Clarke C.F. Williams W. Teruya J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16636-16644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are two unidentified genes, gerC2of B. subtilis (10Yazdi M.A. Moir A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and o251 of E. coli (12Daniels D.L. Plunkett G.3. Burland V. Blattner F.R. Science. 1992; 257: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), whose predicted protein products showed 69 and 37% identity to the ORF-2 product, respectively. To identify the ORF-2 product, the NcoI-HindIII fragment of the PCR product containing ORF-2 was inserted in pTrc99A, and the resulting plasmid was named as pHE84, which was transformed into E. coli JM109 for expression. E. coli JM109 carrying pHE84 overproduced the ORF-2 product by induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Fig. 3). The crude homogenate of E. coli JM109 harboring pHE84, which contained the ORF-2 products overproduced, was incubated with 0.47 nmol of [1-14C]IPP with 5 nmol of nonlabeled SAM or 0.5 nmol of nonlabeled IPP with 0.8 nmol of 14C-SAM. After incubation the products were extracted with pentane and chromatographed on a reversed phase LKC-18 plate with a solvent system of acetone/water (19:1, v/v) (Fig.4). Both the autoradiograms of the products derived from the reaction with [1-14C]IPP (lane 4) and those derived from the reaction with 14C-SAM (lane 3) showed a major radioactivity spot coinciding with MK-8. The radioactivity of the spot of MK-8 increased with the reaction time as shown in Fig.4 b. These facts clearly indicate that the homogenate ofE. coli cells harboring pHE84 shows 2-octaprenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone methyltransferase activity, which transfers a methyl group from SAM to synthesize MK-8. Another major radioactivity spot coinciding with farnesol in lane 4 seems to be the product synthesized by endogenous IPP isomerase, FPP synthase, and a phosphatase of the host cells. When a similar incubation was carried out with the addition of purified FPP synthase of B. stearothermophilus (20Koyama T. Obata S. Osabe M. Takeshita A. Yokoyama K. Uchida M. Nishino T. Ogura K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1993; 113: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), this spot became more distinct (data not shown). The E. colimutant AN70 cells transformed with pO251 were grown on M9 medium plates. The E. coli AN70 cells harboring pO251 grew well on an M9 medium plate and formed colonies (see Fig. 6). In contrast, AN70 could not grow on this medium. The biosynthetic pathway of MKs has been studied in some detail (21Bentley R. Meganathan R. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1987: 512-520Google Scholar). In B. stearothermophilus the prenyl side chain of MK-7 is derived from HepPP, which is synthesized by HepPP synthase. The gene region of the HepPP synthase has been previously cloned and sequenced, showing three open reading frames, ORF-1, ORF-2, and ORF-3. The structural genes of HepPP synthase have been identified to be ORF-1 and ORF-3, designated heps-1 and heps-2, respectively (9Koike-Takeshita A. Koyama T. Obata S. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18396-18400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). ORF-2 encodes a protein with a molecular weight of 27,132, which has similar sequences to those of some methyltransferases. In this study, we directly identified ORF-2 as the gene encoding 2-heptaprenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone methyltransferase by examining the enzymatic activity of its product. There are at least seven enzymes that are involved in the biosynthesis of MK as shown in Fig. 1. Methylation of 2-heptaprenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone is the final step in the biosynthesis of MK-7. The genes encoding the enzymes for the other five steps in menaquinone biosynthesis have been identified so far, and four of them have been shown to be in a cluster (menB, menC,menD, and menE) in E. coli (2Guest J.R. Shaw D.J. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1981; 181: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A similar cluster has been also found in B. subtilis (6Miller P. Rabinowitz A. Taber H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2735-2741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although menC has not yet been identified. However, the 2-heptaprenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone methyltransferase gene has not yet been cloned. The ORF-2 of B. stearothermophilus, which is identified as the 2-heptaprenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone methyltransferase gene of this bacterium, is located between the genes encoding the two peculiar components of HepPP synthase. Thus we designate this genemenG. Fig. 2 shows the comparison of amino acid sequence between 2-heptaprenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone methyltransferase, MenG of B. stearothermophilus, and other methyltransferases. B. stearothermophilus 2-heptaprenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone methyltransferase and the unidentified E. coli protein encoded by o251 share a 37% amino acid sequence identity. Daniels et al. have indicated that ubiE is genetically mapped to the region from 84.5 to 86.5 min on the E. coli chromosome, but they have not identified the gene (12Daniels D.L. Plunkett G.3. Burland V. Blattner F.R. Science. 1992; 257: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In this region there are 82 open reading frames including o251, which is located at 86 min on the E. coli chromosome. Of particular interest is the fact that UbiE catalyzes SAM-dependent methylation of 2-octaprenyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone, the latter step in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone (21Bentley R. Meganathan R. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1987: 512-520Google Scholar). From the map position and its sequence similarity to that of some methyltransferases, o251 seems to correspond to ubiE (Fig. 5). E. coli produces both of the isoprenoid quinones of ubiquinone-8 and MK-8. An E. coli mutant AN70 (ubiE), which is deficient of a specific methyltransferase in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway, has also been shown to be completely devoid of MK and contain a high level of demethylmenaquinone-8 (22Wissenbach U. Ternes D. Unden G. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Our complementation experiments with the mutant AN70 harboring pO251, which contains o251 of E. coli in pTrc99A, showed growth restoration of the E. coli mutant on a minimal medium (Fig. 6). These results suggest that E. coliUbiE was encoded by o251 in E. coli. The methylation of demethyl-MK is chemically very similar to that of 2-octaprenyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone catalyzed by UbiE, because in both reactions the methyl group is transferred to the 1,4-quinoid ring systems at position C-3. It is therefore interesting to examine whetherubiE encodes the methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups both to 2-octaprenyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone and to 2-octaprenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone. Because MK-7 is the dominant MK in B. stearothermophilus, the ORF-2 product should be assigned as 2-heptaprenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone methyltransferase. Thus, we propose to designate this gene menG. In our in vitroexperiments the cell homogenate of E. coli harboring pHE84 synthesized MK-8, which has the prenyl side chain one isoprene unit longer than that of B. stearothermophilus. This fact indicates that the substrate specificity of the methyltransferase is not very stringent for the prenyl side chain of demethyl-MK. This is similar to the specificities of UbiA of E. coli (23Melzer M. Heide L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and of COQ2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (24Suzuki K. Ueda M. Yuasa M. Nakagawa T. Kawamukai M. Matsuda H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 1814-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which are 4-hydroxy-benzoate-octaprenyl transferase and 4-hydroxy-benzoate-hexaprenyl transferase in ubiquinone biosynthesis, respectively. Similarly, the 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate-octaprenyl transferase of Micrococcus luteus has been shown to have such a wide specificity with respect to prenyl diphosphate substrates (25Saito Y. Ogura K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1981; 89: 1445-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We are grateful to Dr. G. Unden and Dr. I. G. Young for suppling the bacterial strain AN70 and Chika Ishida for cooperation in the construction of pO251."

The mature form of PN1 is a 43-kDa glycoprotein that is found in several tissues throughout the body including a platelet-bound form, although the vast majority of PN1 is found outside the vascular compartment (4Gronke R.S. Knauer D.J. Festoff B.W. Blood. 1989; 73: 472-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Guenther J. Nick H. Monard D. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1963-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). PN1 forms complexes with its target proteases, acting as a suicide inhibitor, and is presumably cleaved during the inhibitory reaction (2Baker J.B. Low D.A. Simmer R.L. Cunningham D.D. Cell. 1980; 21: 37-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). It is clear that a structural rearrangement of PN1 occurs as a result of complex formation that renders it endocytosis competent, because free PN1 competes 100–1,000-fold less effectively for the uptake of radiolabeled PN1-protease complexes by clearance receptors on human fibroblasts than the corresponding unlabeled complexes at 37 °C (6Howard E. Knauer D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The ultimate clearance receptor for complexes of PN1 with urokinase (Uk-PN1) has recently been identified as the α2-macroglobulin receptor also known as the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (7Conese M. Olson D. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17886-17892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, whereas the LRP is responsible for the endocytosis of Uk-PN1 complexes, the urinary plasminogen activator receptor is required for the initial binding of the complexes to cells, which is then dependent on the LRP for endocytosis (8Olson D. Pollanen J. Hoyer-Hansen G. Ronne E. Sakaguchi K. Wun T.C. Appela E. Dano K. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9129-9133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The endocytosis of Th-PN1 complexes is also LRP-dependent, but it is not dependent on the urinary plasminogen activator receptor (8Olson D. Pollanen J. Hoyer-Hansen G. Ronne E. Sakaguchi K. Wun T.C. Appela E. Dano K. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9129-9133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of the domain(s) in SERPINs that mediate their internalization and degradation remain controversial. A sequence carboxyl-terminal to the cleavage site in several plasma-borne SERPINs (including antithrombin III, heparin co-factor II, and α1-antitrypsin) has been implicated in the binding and internalization of these SERPINs by the SERPIN-enzyme complex receptor in liver cells (9Joslin G. Fallon R.J. Bullock J. Adams S.P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21897-21902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Perlmutter D.H. Glover G.I. Rivetna M. Schasteen C.S. Fallon R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3753-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar); however, these studies have recently been challenged (11Maekawa H. Tollefsen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18604-18609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We initially investigated the homologous carboxyl-terminal sequence in PN1 to determine its potential involvement in PN1-protease complex clearance by human fibroblasts because of the large degree of sequence identity between SERPINs in this region. However, our laboratory was unable to detect any effect of peptides from this region on either the binding or internalization of Th-PN1 complexes by human fibroblasts. In the present studies we have identified a putative structural domain near the amino-terminal region of PN1 that mediates the binding of Th-PN1 complexes to the LRP. A synthetic peptide library representing PN1 sequence was constructed containing peptides 12 amino acids in length with a 3-amino acid overlap. A peptide composed of residues Pro47–Ile58 in the mature PN1 sequence was identified that did not inhibit the binding of Th-PN1 complexes to the cell surface but specifically inhibited their internalization. By comparing the uptake and degradation of PN1-protease complexes in normal mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) and PEA 13 cells (LRP-deficient MEF), it was concluded that the peptide specifically inhibited the transfer of cell surface-bound complexes to the LRP. These studies are the first to identify a narrowly defined, putative binding site in a SERPIN required for LRP-mediated internalization. Cell culture medium was Cellgro DMEM from Mediatech Inc. Antibiotics and amino acid supplements were from Irvine Scientific. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Gemini, Inc. Cell culture plastics and pipettes were from Corning. Normal MEF and PEA 13 cells, mouse embryo fibroblasts deficient in the LRP, were a generous gift from Dr. J. Herz (12Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Science. 1994; 107: 719-726PubMed Google Scholar). Pure human thrombin, approximately 3,000 NIH units/mg was from Boehringer Mannheim. Porcine mucosal heparin was purchased from Calbiochem. Na125-Iodine was from Amersham Corp. Peptide synthesis reagents, including all of the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) derivatized amino acids were purchased from Advanced Chemtech, Inc., with the exception of the solid support beads, which were purchased from Milligen. All other common organic solvents and reagents were from Fisher. Both human fibroblasts and mouse embryo fibroblasts were grown in DMEM supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, l-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (6Howard E. Knauer D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Experimental cultures were maintained in serum-free medium for 72 h prior to use. Peptides in the library were synthesized on a 10-μmol scale in individual 10 cc syringes and monitored for coupling efficiency at each step as described previously (13Fields G.B. Noble R.L. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 161-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2333) Google Scholar, 14Kent S.B.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 957-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 15Glabe C.G. Technique. 1990; 2: 138-146Google Scholar). All of the peptides were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a semi-preparative C-4 column using a 0 to 60% acetonitrile gradient over a 60-min time interval. The purified peptides were weighed and dissolved to a final concentration of 500 μg/ml in PBS. Typical recoveries ranged from 1 to 3 mg for each of the peptides. Large scale peptide synthesis was carried out similarly, using a semi-automated peptide synthesizer (15Glabe C.G. Technique. 1990; 2: 138-146Google Scholar). Human thrombin was radioiodinated using Iodogen as described previously (16Knauer D.J. Thompson J.A. Cunningham D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 117: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The specific activities ranged from 8,000 to 20,000 cpm/ng. PN1 was purified from the serum-free culture medium of human fibroblasts grown on Cytodex 1 microcarrier beads and was active site titrated with human thrombin (6Howard E. Knauer D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 1 μg of radioiodinated human thrombin (17Howard E.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 684-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was incubated with two times the amount of PN1 required to inactivate the 1 μg of thrombin. The reaction mixture was sampled and tested for active thrombin using a colorimetric assay (data not shown). We have previously documented that the appearance of trichloroacetic acid soluble radioactivity (primarily 125I-Tyr) in the supernatants of cells incubated with 125I-Th-PN1 complexes results from the internalization and lysosomal degradation of the complexes (16Knauer D.J. Thompson J.A. Cunningham D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 117: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cell cultures were incubated with 125I-Th-PN1 complexes at a concentration of 100 or 200 ng/ml in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml of BSA and the indicated concentrations of peptides. At the indicated time points, aliquots were removed and assayed for trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity (16Knauer D.J. Thompson J.A. Cunningham D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 117: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Construction and screening of a PN1 peptide library. Beginning with the first amino acid in the mature PN1 sequence, a synthetic peptide library was constructed that extended to the P1 residue in the reactive center. All of the peptides were synthesized on Cys derivatized resin, such that all of the peptides were 13 amino acids in length and contained a Cys at the carboxyl terminus. Shown in Fig.1 A are the sequences of all peptides in the library, including HBP, a 17-amino acid heparin binding peptide derived from PN1 sequence (18Rovelli G. Stone S.R. Guidolin A. Sommer J. Monard D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3542-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); and CT, a 35-amino acid carboxyl-terminal peptide that begins at the P1′ site of PN1 and ends at the carboxyl terminus. Initially, the peptides in the PN1 library were screened for the inhibition of cell surface binding. None of the peptides had a measurable effect (data not shown). The peptides were then screened for their effect on 125I-Th-PN1 complex degradation by human foreskin fibroblasts (HF cells) using a trichloroacetic acid soluble radioactivity assay (Fig. 1 B). Each peptide was added to triplicate wells of HF cell monolayers at a concentration of 25 μg/ml, in medium containing 100 ng/ml of 125I-Th-PN1 complexes. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, aliquots of the medium were removed and precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid. Of the peptides tested, only peptide 4 (Pro47–Ile58-Cys) displayed a significant inhibitory effect on 125I-Th-PN1 complex turnover. In the absence of any added peptide, 20 fmol of complexes were degraded in 2 h (Fig. 1 B, con). In the presence of Pro47–Ile58-Cys, degradation of125I-Th-PN1 was inhibited by over 90%. Neither the HBP nor the CT had a significant effect on the turnover of Th-PN1 complexes (Fig. 1). To assess the relative effectiveness and specificity of Pro47–Ile58-Cys in inhibiting the degradation of 125I-Th-PN1 complexes, the dose dependence of inhibition was determined. Also tested were Pro47–Ile58without a carboxyl-terminal Cys and a random sequence peptide. The inhibition of 125I-Th-PN1 complex turnover was found to be dependent on Pro47–Ile58-Cys concentration. At a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml, degradation was inhibited by 60% and progressed to 90% at 5.0 μg/ml (Fig. 2). Higher concentrations of Pro47–Ile58-Cys did not result in further inhibition. The dose dependence of the inhibition of125I-Th-PN1 complex degradation by Pro47–Ile58-Cys suggests that it acts as a competitive inhibitor for a saturable cellular component. The residual, small amount of degradation at the optimal dose of Pro47–Ile58-Cys is most likely due to adsorptive phase endocytosis. Because Pro47–Ile58-Cys contains a carboxyl-terminal Cys, as do all of the peptides in the library, Pro47–Ile58 was synthesized without the Cys to rule out any contribution of the carboxyl-terminal Cys to the inhibitory activity. The inhibitory activity of Pro47–Ile58 without the Cys was identical to Pro47–Ile58-Cys (Fig. 2). Additionally, a randomized peptide of the same amino acid composition of Pro47–Ile58 did not inhibit125I-Th-PN1 complex degradation, indicating that the effect of Pro47–Ile58-Cys is sequence-specific (Fig.2). Because it has been previously shown that the LRP is not involved in the initial binding of Uk-PN1 complexes to the cell surface but is required for internalization, we next examined the effect of Pro47–Ile58-Cys on Th-PN1 complex internalization and binding. The fate of 125I-Th-PN1 complexes was followed over a 30-min time course in the presence and the absence of Pro47–Ile58-Cys (Fig.3). At the indicated times, the cultures were rapidly chilled on ice, and cell surface-bound complexes were stripped to discriminate between internalized and cell surface-bound complexes (6Howard E. Knauer D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Pro47–Ile58-Cys did not have a significant effect on the cell surface binding of 125I-Th-PN1 complexes when compared with the no peptide control (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, Pro47–Ile58-Cys inhibited complex internalization by 70–80% throughout the 30-min time course (Fig.3 B). These data demonstrate that Pro47–Ile58-Cys potently inhibits the internalization of 125I-Th-PN1 complexes but apparently does not significantly inhibit cell surface binding. These data are most consistent with a model in which PN1 initially binds to an unidentified cell surface component and are subsequently internalized by the LRP. To demonstrate this directly, experiments were next done using normal MEF and PEA 13 cells (MEF in which the LRP gene is interrupted) (12Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Science. 1994; 107: 719-726PubMed Google Scholar). Normal MEF secrete PN1 and rapidly internalize and degrade 125I-Th-PN1 complexes via a lysosomal pathway (16Knauer D.J. Thompson J.A. Cunningham D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 117: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that Pro47–Ile58-Cys acts directly as a competitive inhibitor for the binding of Th-PN1 complexes to the LRP, normal MEF and PEA 13 cells (which lack a functional LRP) were evaluated in parallel for their ability to degrade 125I-Th-PN1 complexes. Confluent cultures were incubated with125I-Th-PN1 complexes at 37 °C. At the indicated times, aliquots of the medium were removed and quantitated for the appearance of trichloroacetic acid soluble radioactivity. Normal MEF internalized and degraded 30 fmol of 125I-Th-PN1 complexes by 4 h (Fig. 4). In contrast, PEA 13 cells degraded only 4 fmol of 125I-Th-PN1 complexes in the same time period, demonstrating the requirement of a functional LRP for complex internalization. Importantly, Pro47–Ile58-Cys inhibited 125I-Th-PN1 degradation by 87% in normal MEF (LRP+), reducing their metabolism of complexes to the level seen in PEA 13 cells (LRP−). These data strongly suggest that Pro47–Ile58-Cys directly competes with125I-Th-PN1 complexes for LRP-mediated internalization. The first studies aimed at the identification of the receptors involved in the clearance of SERPIN-enzyme complexes began using anin vivo model (19Pizzo S.V. Mast A.E. Feldman S.R. Salvesen G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 967: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and only recently have some of the components involved in this process been identified at the molecular level. The term clearance may be an understatement of the importance of the process, because in the case of some SERPINs, clearance is tied to a positive feedback signaling loop that results in SERPIN up-regulation at the level of transcription, translation, and secretion (20Perlmutter D.H. Travis J. Punsai P.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1774-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, SERPIN clearance has also been linked to cytokine regulation (21Kardowska A. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21023-21026PubMed Google Scholar). The control point in the feedback loop apparently resides within the SERPIN-protease complex structure. The receptors responsible for SERPIN-enzyme complex clearance are not known in all cases, but several, including proteases complexed to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (22Strickland D.K.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17886-17892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and α1-antitrypsin (25Poller W. Willnow T.E. Hilpert J. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2841-2845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), are known to be cleared ultimately by the LRP/α2-macroglobulin receptor. α1-Antichymotrypsin complexes, although closely related, are not cleared by the LRP but may be cleared by a LRP-related receptor, gp330 (25Poller W. Willnow T.E. Hilpert J. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2841-2845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It also was demonstrated in a recent study that the LRP is responsible for the endocytosis of heparin co-factor II-thrombin complexes and antithrombin III-thrombin complexes in HepG2 cells and normal MEF (26Kounnas M. Church F. Argraves S. Strickland D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The present studies were undertaken to identify the region(s) of PN1 involved in HF cell complex clearance other than the previously implicated carboxyl-terminal region (10Perlmutter D.H. Glover G.I. Rivetna M. Schasteen C.S. Fallon R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3753-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The approach taken here was to construct a peptide library representing virtually the entire sequence of mature PN1 excluding residues P9-P1 of the reactive loop. Peptides in the library were initially screened for their ability to inhibit the turnover of 125I-Th-PN1 complexes by HF cells. A single peptide, Pro47–Ile58-Cys, was found to be a potent inhibitor of 125I-Th-PN1 complex turnover. This peptide was found to inhibit endocytosis of125I-Th-PN1 complexes rather than initial cell surface binding. The identity of the LRP as the receptor responsible for the endocytosis of the 125I-Th-PN1 complexes was rigorously verified using normal MEF (LRP+) and PEA 13 mouse embryo fibroblast (LRP−) cell lines (12Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Science. 1994; 107: 719-726PubMed Google Scholar). PEA 13 cells are unable to efficiently internalize and degrade 125I-Th-PN1 complexes, whereas the LRP+ cells internalized and degraded large quantities of the complexes. Degradation of the complexes by the LRP+ cells was markedly inhibited by Pro47–Ile58-Cys. Further experiments verified that Pro47–Ile58-Cys did not affect complex formation and did not induce aggregation of the complexes (data not shown). SERPINs, in general, are not taken up by clearance receptors in their native conformations. Only SERPIN-enzyme complexes are endocytosed efficiently, apparently due to the exposure or generation of a binding site in the complexed form (20Perlmutter D.H. Travis J. Punsai P.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1774-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Previous studies have focused on residues in the P′ side of the reactive loop, because of the dramatic structural shift undergone by this region upon complex formation (27Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). However, the present studies strongly indicate that the sequence, Pro47–Ile58, that resides near the amino-terminal end of PN1, plays an important role in the LRP-mediated endocytosis of PN1-Th complexes. This sequence is apparently unordered and exists as a loop structure that is bounded by sheet-6B on the amino-terminal side and by helix-B on the carboxyl-terminal side. The minimal loop most likely consists of the seven underlined amino acid residues, PHDNIVISP, set off by the two proline residues, one at each end. Because there is no crystal structure data available for PN1, it is not possible to say with certainty whether this site is masked or partially masked in uncomplexed PN1."

Although this is a cytosolic detoxication enzyme, the pH optimum for the standard assay substrate 4-nitrophenol is at pH 5.5; upon oxidation, the optimum changes to the physiological pH range. The principal effect of the change in pH optimum is activation, which is manifest by an increase in K′cat without any major influence on substrate binding. In contrast, with tyrosine methyl ester as a substrate, the enzyme's optimum activity occurs at pH 8.0; upon oxidation, it ceases to be a substrate at any pH. The presence of Cys66 was essential for activation to occur, thereby providing a putative reason underlying the conserved nature of this cysteine throughout the phenol sulfotransferase family. Mapping of disulfides by mass spectrometry showed the critical event to be the oxidation of Cys66 to form a disulfide with either Cys232 or glutathione, either one is effective. These results point to a mechanism for regulating the activity of a key enzyme in xenobiotic detoxication during cellular oxidative stress.

A sulfotransferase prepared in homogeneous form from the cytosol of rat liver incongruously has at least two very different pH optima depending on the test substrate.

Marshall A.D. McPhie P. Guo W.X. Xie X. Chen X. Jakoby W.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 423-429Google Scholar). The second assay is the two-stage transfer of the sulfuryl group from 4-nitrophenyl sulfate to form PAPS in the presence of PAP and the subsequent transfer to 2-naphthol as the acceptor phenol (Equation 2) (2Yang Y.S. Marshall A.D. McPhie P. Guo W.X. Xie X. Chen X. Jakoby W.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 423-429Google Scholar). Under the assay conditions used, activity in the physiological direction was almost 10-fold lower than in the artificial transfer reaction. PAPS±4-nitrophenol⇌PAP±4-nitrophenylsulfate(Eq. 1) 4-Nitrophenylsulfate±2-naphthol⇌PAP4-nitrophenol±2-naphthylsulfate(Eq. 2) Upon prolonged storage, enzyme preparations were found to modestly increase their physiological activity at the expense of the transfer activity. These changes were abolished by addition of EDTA or thiols and were induced by disulfides. Significantly, glutathione disulfide, the major form of cellular oxidized disulfide (9Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Google Scholar, 10Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. 1990; 63: 96-172Google Scholar), was an efficient activator. Each monomer of the homodimeric sulfotransferase contains five cysteine residues. The first of these from the amino-terminal, Cys66, is highly conserved among phenol sulfotransferases (11Falany C.N. Zhuang W. Falany J.L. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 92: 57-66Google Scholar, 12Zheng Y. Bergold A. Duffel M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30313-30319Google Scholar). Although a role for the cysteine residues in these enzymes has been suspected, their function has remained elusive. In N-ethylmaleimide inactivation of a rat liver enzyme, two of the five cysteine residues were found to react with the reagent and were protected from reacting by both PAPS and 4-nitrophenol (13Borchardt R.T. Schasteen C.S. Wu S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 708: 280-293Google Scholar). Replacement of Cys70, the first cysteine residue from the amino-terminal end in the human form of phenol sulfotransferase, with serine resulted in the loss of N-ethylmaleimide inactivation, indicating that this cysteine was not essential for catalytic activity (11Falany C.N. Zhuang W. Falany J.L. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 92: 57-66Google Scholar). Participation of the first cysteine was suggested in the binding of the nucleotide substrate, since it was found that ATP-dialdehyde, a PAP analogue and affinity label, was covalently linked to the rat enzyme at Cys66 and the adjacent Lys65 (12Zheng Y. Bergold A. Duffel M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30313-30319Google Scholar). Here, we describe a sequence of changes in the enzyme's activity profile brought about by oxidation of the cysteine residues of aryl sulfotransferase IV. Replacement of each of the five cysteine residues by site-directed mutagenesis, in combination with mapping of disulfides by mass spectroscopic methods, has provided details of the underlying mechanism. Hydroxyapatite-agarose (SpectraGel/HA) was purchased from Spectrum (Los Angeles, CA); 4-aminobenzenesulfonyl fluoride and dithiothreitol from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH) and bis-tris propane from Calbiochem; sucrose and glycerol were from J. T. Baker Inc., and all other compounds not designated were at the highest grade available from Sigma. Thin layer chromatography plates of DEAE-cellulose (number 13255) and Silica Gel (number 13179) were from Eastman Kodak Co. Recombinant wild type and mutant sulfotransferases were isolated from E. coli BL21(DE3) bearing the pET3c11 vector (6Chen X. Yang Y.S. Zheng Y. Martin B.M. Duffel M.W. Jakoby W.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 421-426Google Scholar). The enzyme isolation procedure was the same for all of the sulfotransferase preparations (2Yang Y.S. Marshall A.D. McPhie P. Guo W.X. Xie X. Chen X. Jakoby W.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 423-429Google Scholar) and resulted in greater than 95% homogeneity for each as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Cys → Ser mutants were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis using polymerase chain reaction amplification of oligomers of 30 nucleotides with a single base substitution as the mutant primer (6Chen X. Yang Y.S. Zheng Y. Martin B.M. Duffel M.W. Jakoby W.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 421-426Google Scholar). The expected mutation was confirmed by sequencing the entire mutant cDNA. Of the two forms of the enzyme, only the β form, which is free of bound PAP (2Yang Y.S. Marshall A.D. McPhie P. Guo W.X. Xie X. Chen X. Jakoby W.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 423-429Google Scholar), was used here. Since the enzyme was not expressed by E. coli bearing the plasmid for mutant C232S, a double mutant containing C232S and M228I was used. The details of the spectrophotometric standard transfer assay and the physiological assay have been presented (2Yang Y.S. Marshall A.D. McPhie P. Guo W.X. Xie X. Chen X. Jakoby W.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 423-429Google Scholar). The standard assay (Equation 2) measures the exchange of the sulfuryl group from 4-nitrophenyl sulfate to 2-naphthol in the presence of 20 μM PAP at pH 7.0 and is determined by measurement of the formation of 4-nitrophenol (ϵ400 = 10.5 × 103 at pH 7.0). Note that two reactions are actually involved: the initial generation of PAPS, the sulfate of which, in turn, is transferred to a second phenol (2Yang Y.S. Marshall A.D. McPhie P. Guo W.X. Xie X. Chen X. Jakoby W.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 423-429Google Scholar). In the physiological assay (Equation 1), 4-nitrophenol is conjugated with PAPS as the donor. All reactions are all carried out at 25°C in a Hitachi U3110 spectrophotometer in cuvettes of 1-cm light path. Rates were linear with time and protein concentration when average absorbance changes at 400 nm of less than 0.025/min were followed for 3 min. Both of these assays are limited to the pH range of 6.5-7.5, because 4-nitrophenol has a pKa of 7.14. This limitation was avoided in the physiological tracer assay by the inclusion of radioactive [35S]PAPS in Reaction R1 along with 1 mM acceptor substrate in a final volume of 100 μl containing succinate-NaOH or bis-tris propane-HCl at the required pH values. The reaction was initiated by addition of PAPS (740 μm) containing 0.1 μCi [35S]PAPS per vessel and carried out at 37°C for 10 min before termination with 25 μl of 2 M acetic acid. After centrifugation, a 3-μl aliquot was used for the separation of 35S-labeled product from [35S]PAPS by thin layer chromatography (4Guo W.X. Yang Y.S. Chen X. McPhie P. Jakoby W.B. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 92: 25-31Google Scholar, 15Ramaswamy S.G. Jakoby W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 201-207Google Scholar). Radiolabeled entities were quantified by phosphorimaging of the TLC plates with a Fuji BAS-1500 Phosphorimager. The reaction was linear with respect to time and concentration over the range 0.02-20 nmol product formed per incubation mixture. Sulfotransferase solutions were diluted to a volume of 1 ml containing 100 mM bis-tris propane-HCl at pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 12.5% (v/v) glycerol, and 125 mM sucrose (buffer A). The preparation was exchanged through a Pharmacia PD-10 Sephadex G25 column equilibrated with buffer A to remove reducing agent present from the storage buffer and diluted to 7.5 μM enzyme in the same buffer based on an ϵ280 of 6.07 × 104 that is assumed to be identical for wild type enzyme and mutants. Enzyme was incubated with 1 mM GSSG, GSH, or with various ratios of GSSG:GSH at 25°C; higher temperatures led to precipitation of the enzyme. Samples were withdrawn at intervals for measurement of activity in the standard and physiological spectrophotometric assays and for analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). In a separate series of trials, PAP and 4-nitrophenol, each at concentrations between 0.2 and 200 μM were added during incubation with GSSG. The apparent Km for PAP and 4-nitrophenyl sulfate were determined by the transfer assay procedure and, for PAPS and 4-nitrophenol, by the physiological assay. Sulfotransferase was incubated for 1 h with 1 mM GSSG at 25°C or with 1 mM DTT before addition of substrates. Data were analyzed with the EnzymeKinetics (Trinity Software) program. Kd was estimated at 25°C with a Hitachi F2000 spectrofluorimeter by following changes in fluorescence due to the binding of ANS to the enzyme (16Ketley J.N. Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8670-8673Google Scholar). Sulfotransferase, 750 nM, was incubated at 25°C in a quartz cuvette of 1-cm cross-section with 10 μM ANS in 100 mM bis-tris propane-HCl at pH 7.0. Fluorescence was measured at 465 nm after excitation at 380 nm and observed as a decrease for the addition of all ligands with the exception of an increase in the case of PAP binding. For the determination, reduced enzyme was prepared by measurement in 1 mM DTT; oxidized enzyme was prepared by incubating a 7.5 μM protein solution for 1 h with 1 mM GSSG. Where necessary, corrections were made for dilution; absorbance was sufficiently low that correction for inner filter effects was not required. The binding of ligands to multiple sites, which is the case here, has been described by Knott based on the Scatchard equation, and using the PCMLAB program (17Knott G.D. Am. Lab. 1995; : 48-54Google Scholar). Fluorescence titration curves of sulfotransferase by ANS may be analyzed by a simple extension of this technique. The dye is assumed to bind to a number of independent sites, on the protein, each with a characteristic association constant and a change in intensity of fluorescence. Experimental data were fit to yield the values of the association constants and intensity changes that are presented in Table I. In all cases, good fits were obtained assuming the presence of only two binding sites. When the change in fluorescence was a linear function of added dye concentration, the binding was assumed to be stoichiometric, i.e. with an association constant > 15,000 μM−1. The number of available free cysteine thiol groups of the sulfotransferase were estimated after exchange through a PD-10 column into buffer A. Enzyme at a concentration of 7.5 μM was incubated with 0.3 mM DTNB at 25°C. Formation of the 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate ion was followed at 412 nm (ϵ = 14,150 M−1 cm−1) (18Jocelyn P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 44-67Google Scholar). Sulfotransferase, 7.5 μM in buffer A, was incubated with 1 mM GSSG. The reaction was stopped at 1, 4, and 24 h by exchange through a PD-10 column into 10 mM HCl. Under conditions of proteolysis by trypsin, however, the reaction with GSSG was stopped for this purpose by alkylating remaining thiol groups by incubation with 45 mM 4-vinylpyridine at 25°C for 1 h in the dark; this was adequate to assure elimination of migration of disulfide bonds. After dialysis against 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate at pH 8, the protein was cleaved by incubation at 37°C for 2 h with 2% (w/w) trypsin. Control samples were treated in the same manner. All samples were lyophilized before being dissolved in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was performed on a Fisons Instruments VG Quattro II triple quadrapole mass spectrometer (Manchester, UK) fitted with a Megaflow electrospray source. The Quattro II was controlled by a digital DECpcLPx 466d2 computer running Fisons MassLynx 2.1 software. The LC interface to the mass spectrometer consisted of Shimadzu LC10AD solvent delivery modules. Flow injection analysis of the complete protein was conducted by injecting samples into a 40 μl/min flow of 50% acetonitrile, 50% water, which carried the sample plug into the electrospray source. ESI-MS instrument settings were as follows: source temperature = 100°C; N2 drying gas = 500 liters/h; nebulizing gas = 20 liters/h; probe voltage = 4 kV; cone voltage = 33 V; probe position: on axis. Acquisition was carried out from m/z 200-2000 Da over 4.5 s in a CONTINUUM scanning mode. The calibration file was created for analysis of protein using a solution of myoglobin. Deconvolution of ions was accomplished using the “Maximum Entropy Program” (MaxEnt, Fisons, Manchester, UK). Peptides obtained from tryptic cleavage were separated by reverse phase HPLC using an Ultrasphere C18 column (2.0 mm × 25 cm; Beckman, Fullerton, CA). Elution of the peptides was accomplished with solvents A (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and B (0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 90% acetonitrile and water); the initial concentration of solvent B was increased linearly from 5 to 60% in solvent A during 80 min at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. The column eluate was monitored at 215 nm using a Shimadzu SPD-10AV module detector. ESI-MS instrument settings were as follows: source temperature = 150°C; N2 drying gas = 500 liters/h; nebulizing gas = 20 liters/h; probe voltage = 3.6 kV; cone voltage = 35-50 V; probe position: off axis. Acquisition was carried out from m/z 200-2000 Da over 4.5 s in the CENTROID scanning mode, with unit resolution up to at least 1500 Da based on calibration and resolution optimization using polyethylene glycol at Mr 300, 600, and 1000. The identity of GSH-conjugated peptides was confirmed by LC/MS and tandem MS/MS, using multiple reaction monitoring to specifically look for the neutral ion loss of 129 Da from the parent ion under collision-induced dissociation conditions (19Baillie T.A. Davis M.R. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 22: 319-325Google Scholar). The aryl sulfotransferase catalyzed the transfer of sulfate from 4-nitrophenyl sulfate to 2-naphthol in the transfer assay system (Equation 2) with a specific activity of approximately 600 nmol/mg/min. In comparison, the activity toward 4-nitrophenol with PAPS as the sulfate donor in the physiological assay system (Equation 1) was 10-fold lower at about 60 nmol/mg/min. Modest increases in the physiological activity could be achieved by incubation of enzyme in buffer A at 25°C for several hours. These increases were eliminated by inclusion of 1 mM concentrations of EDTA, DTT, or GSH, suggesting involvement of an oxidative process. When the enzyme was incubated with 1 mM GSSG, however, a large rise occurred in the physiological activity within 30-60 min, achieving a maximum of 600 μmol/mg/min; thereafter, activity very slowly and steadily declined (Fig. 1A). In contrast, transfer activity decreased upon oxidation with GSSG: the fall was initially rapid, but then became parallel to the slow decline phase of the physiological reaction (Fig. 1A). Incubation of 7.5 μM enzyme with 5 and 10 μM GSSG achieved specific activities in the physiological reaction of 350 and 460 μmol/mg/min, respectively. With these low concentrations of oxidant, maximum activity was sustained but took longer to attain. Using 20 μM GSSG, a ratio slightly in excess of 2 mol/enzyme dimer, the decline phase in the activity profile was regained and, at concentrations higher than 50 μM GSSG, all activity curves showed essentially similar phases of rise and decline (Fig. 1B). Altering the redox ratio of GSSG to GSH at a constant 1 mM total glutathione concentration also changed the timing and maximum activities achieved, but only at 1:3 GSSG:GSH (250 μm GSSG) and above was there a later decline in activity (Fig. 1C). Addition of 0.2 μM bovine liver protein disulfide-isomerase (EC 5.3.4.1) (Sigma) to 7 μM sulfotransferase increased the rate of formation of the activated enzyme (not shown). After 30 min of incubation, and using a 1:99 ratio of GSSG to GSH, a 4-fold increase in activity was observed due to inclusion of the isomerase; after 60 min of incubation, the increase was 9-fold. Inclusion of PAP in the enzyme/GSSG incubation mixture blocked activation. With 1 mol of PAP/dimer or greater, there was no activation at 1 h in the presence of 1 mM GSSG. It was not possible to determine the effect of PAPS on GSSG activation, since PAPS is rapidly hydrolyzed by the enzyme at physiological pH (3Duffel M.W. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11123-11127Google Scholar). Excess PAP, 200 μM, added at any time after exposure to GSSG, arrested all further activity changes and, in the presence of a redox mixture of 1:1 GSSG:GSH, led to slow but complete reversal of the activity changes that had occurred: physiological activity declined and the transfer activity was regained (data not shown). Five mutant enzymes, one for each of the cysteine residues of the protein, were examined for the effects of oxidation with GSSG. Three of them, C232S,M228I, C283S, and C289S, responded with changes in the activity profile identical to those shown for the wild type enzyme upon incubation with GSSG. Mutant C82S attained between 60 and 80% of the maximal specific activity. Mutant C66S was unique in lacking the activation response; instead, C66S exhibited only a gradual time-dependant decline in both physiological and transfer activities (Fig. 1A). As was observed with the wild type enzyme, 200 μM PAP blocked the activity changes seen for of all the cysteine mutants in GSSG-containing buffer and caused reversal of the effects in redox buffer containing 1:1 GSSG:GSH (data not shown). The tracer physiological assay was used to determine pH activity profiles toward 4-nitrophenol, tyrosine methyl ester, and 1-hexanol as representative acceptor substrates. Assays were performed either in the presence of 1 mM DTT or after treatment of the enzyme with 1 mM GSSG for 1 h at 25°C. When in the presence of the reducing agent DTT, optimum activity for 4-nitrophenol was observed at pH 5.2, whereas activity in the physiological pH region was minimal. From Fig. 2A it can be seen that treatment with 1 mM GSSG leads to a 17-fold increase in optimum activity and a shift in pH optimum to between 6.5 and 7.5 (Fig. 2A). Each of the cysteine mutant enzymes displayed such a change in activity with the exception of the mutant C66S which, although minimally activated by oxidation, remained active only in the acid pH range (Fig. 2B). Tyrosine methyl ester, an eponymous substrate for the enzyme, and 1-hexanol are dissimilar to 4-nitrophenol in that there is extensive and optimal activity in the physiological pH range (Fig. 2, C and E) under reducing conditions; both compounds cease to be substrates upon oxidation. Mutant C66S displayed pH optima and sulfation rates toward tyrosine methyl ester and 1-hexanol similar to those of the wild type enzyme but differed in that 1-h treatment with GSSG resulted in only a 50% reduction and not abolition of activity (Fig. 2, D and F). The apparent Kd values for the nucleotides PAP and PAPS were determined by displacement of the binding of the hydrophobic fluorescent dye ANS. Fluorescence changes induced by binding were both positive and negative depending upon the ligand tested. Binding of PAP elicited a slight decrease in fluorescence at very low concentrations (<90 nM for reduced enzyme and 800 nM for oxidized); above these concentrations, very large increases in fluorescence occurred, reaching a maximum at about 100 μM for enzyme with DTT and 200 μM for the oxidized form. Large decreases in fluorescence were observed upon binding of 2-naphthol and 2-naphthyl sulfate. Attempts at determining the dissociation constant for PAPS were not effective because of time-dependent changes in fluorescence believed to result from the futile hydrolysis of PAPS by the enzyme to yield PAP (3Duffel M.W. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11123-11127Google Scholar). The association of enzyme and PAP could be analyzed with the PCMLAB program, revealing the best fit to be attained by a two binding site model for each of the ligands. Stoichiometric binding was found to occur at the first site for PAP, 2-naphthol and 2-naphthyl sulfate regardless of oxidation state of the enzyme. At the second site, however, oxidation of the protein with 1 mM GSSG for 1 h elicited a 30-fold increase in Kd for PAP, but only small decreases in Kd for 2-naphthol and 2-naphthyl sulfate (Table I). In each instance, the total fluorescence change was greater using the completely reduced enzyme than that treated with GSSG. The spectrophotometric physiological and transfer assays were used to compare apparent Km and Kcat for substrates with enzyme in the presence of DTT or after incubation with GSSG for 1 h. Upon oxidation there were changes in the K′m and K′cat for the wild type and mutant enzymes with the sole exception of the mutant C66S for which both of these parameters remained constant. For the physiological assay system, partial oxidation caused K′m increases for 4-nitrophenol and PAPS. Despite the higher K′m, K′cat was 6-15-fold greater upon GSSG oxidation (Table II). Similar changes in the apparent K′m for PAP and 4-naphthyl sulfate were observed using the transfer assay system, whereas K′cat values, in contrast, decreased 2-3-fold in all but mutant C82S for which K′cat doubled (data not presented). The change in the number of titratable enzyme thiol groups, estimated by reaction with DTNB, is recorded in Table III as a function of time of exposure to GSSG. Prior to oxidation, 4.0 of the five known cysteine groups per subunit were titratable with DTNB for the wild type enzyme, and between 3.5 and 3.7 of the four thiols were found for the mutants in which a cysteine was replaced by serine. After incubation of the enzymes with 1 mM GSSG, there was a decrease in the number of free thiol groups titratable. After 1 h of incubation, wild type and mutants C82S, C283S, and C289S lost almost two of the initial free thiol groups, but mutants C66S and C232S,M228I only lost about one. After prolonged incubation with GSSG (24 h), virtually all of the initial free thiol groups of the sulfotransferases were unavailable. When wild type and cysteine mutant enzymes were reduced with DTT and subjected to electrophoresis in SDS under conditions free of reducing agent, each of the enzymes migrated as a single band of 34 kDa. Following overnight oxidation with GSSG, the pattern of electrophoretic migration changed to reveal two major bands of equal density. For wild type and for mutants C66S and C82S, the new bands were at 35 and 31.5 kDa with a minor one at 32 kDa; for cysteine mutants C283S and C289S the new major bands were at 35 and 32 kDa with minor bands at 31.5 and 34 kDa (Fig. 3). These major new bands were barely visible at 1 h, becoming apparent only after prolonged oxidation. Mutant C232S,M228I was exceptional as it showed no changes in electrophoretic pattern upon oxidation (Fig. 3). No significant species of greater Mr was observed at any time period for any enzyme species. In an attempt to ascribe the activation phenomenon of sulfotransferase to specific cysteine residues, the enzymes were subjected to electrospray ionization mass spectral analysis following timed oxidation by GSSG. A multiply charged envelope of ions was obtained which was deconvoluted using the “MaxEnt” program to yield a molecular mass for the wild type protein reacted with GSSG that was 305 Da higher than the original mass. This clearly established the covalent addition of one glutathione to each enzyme subunit over a 24-h time period (Fig. 4). Formation of this new species was slow but progressive with the ion intensity being relatively low at 1 h, the time at which activation of the enzyme was optimum. Additional low intensity ions at approximately 34,510 Da (addition of 2 GSH) and 34,815 Da (3 GSH) were observed after 24 h incubation with GSSG (Fig. 4). The sulfotransferase mutants C66S and C232S,M228I underwent the same mass spectral analysis after oxidation by GSSG and yielded identical profiles. The ions obtained again established the addition of a single glutathione to each of these proteins, but with these mutants the reactions occurred rapidly and were near completion after 1 h (Fig. 4). Upon further incubation, ions indicating the addition of a second glutathione to the proteins were detected as shown for the mutant C232S,M228I (Fi"

We utilized this difference in I-BOP affinity to identify structural determinants of TP receptor heterogeneity. No significant difference was found in the rank order of affinities for a series of thromboxane receptor ligands to bind to cloned human TPα versus rat TP, indicating that these represent species homologs, not distinct TP subtypes. Structural determinants for observed differences in I-BOP bindingKd were localized by creating chimeric human/rat TP followed by mutational substitution of specific critical amino acids. Initially, seven chimeric receptors with splice sites in transmembranes 1, 2, 4, or 7 were constructed and expressed in HEK293 cells for analysis of ligand binding properties. Substitution of any part except the carboxyl tail of the human TP into the rat TP resulted in a receptor with I-BOP binding affinity intermediate between the two. Analysis of chimeras in which only the extracellular amino terminus and a portion of transmembrane 1 were switched localized the determinant of high affinity binding to the region between amino acids 3 and 40. Using this chimera, amino acids in the human portion (extracellular amino terminus and part of transmembrane 1) were replaced with analogous amino acids from rat TP to regain high affinity I-BOP binding. Only when amino acid Val37 and either Val36 or Ala40 were reverted to their respective rat TP counterparts (Ala36, Leu37, and Gly40, respectively) was high affinity I-BOP binding recovered. The mechanism for the increased I-BOP affinity may be the lengthening of the amino acid side chain at position 37, thus extending this group further into the putative I-BOP binding pocket, with compensatory shortening of side chains in spatially adjacent amino acids.

The two human subtypes, designated TPα and TPβ, are the alternately spliced products of a single gene, diverge only in the intracellular carboxyl terminus, and display identical ligand binding characteristics but different patterns of coupling to G-protein effectors (9Hirata T.

The cloned rat and mouse TP are 93% identical at the amino acid level, while, compared with the human TPα, the rat TP is 73% identical. Several laboratories have compared the ligand binding characteristics of human platelet and rat vascular TP and have found that the rat receptor exhibits unique pharmacology exemplified by a binding affinity for the agonist 125I-BOP, which is 10-fold greater than human TP (3Dorn G.W., II Becker M.W.

A comparative study of transfected human TPα and rat TP has confirmed these findings (7D'Angelo D.D. Terasawa T. Carlisle S.J. Dorn G.W., II Lynch K.R. Prostaglandins. 1996; 52: 303-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). There is a great deal of interest in identifying the structural determinants of thromboxane receptor ligand binding due to the potential for development and refinement of subtype-specific agonists and antagonists. To date, two studies have employed mutagenesis to examine the effects of single amino acid substitutions on ligand binding. Funk et al. (13Funk C.D. Furci L. Moran N. Fitzgerald G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 934-939PubMed Google Scholar) modified several amino acids within the seventh transmembrane-spanning domain of human TPα and characterized changes in antagonist binding. However, since the amino acids in transmembrane domain 7 are absolutely conserved in all known TP receptors, these studies do not help to define differences between the naturally occurring receptors. In the second study, our laboratory examined the functional consequences of substitution mutagenesis of cysteine residues within human TPα and identified three cysteines that affected ligand binding (14D'Angelo D.D. Eubank J.J. Davis M.G. Dorn G.W., II. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6233-6240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cysteines 105 and 184, in the first and second extracellular loops, respectively, were absolutely required for binding and were assumed to form an intramolecular disulfide bond. Cysteine 102, in the first extracellular loop, was found to contribute to optimal binding, although the nature of its interaction with ligand was not defined. Because ligand binding affinity is probably determined by multiple contiguous or widely separated amino acid residues, complete identification of the ligand binding pocket is not likely to be accomplished by substitution mutagenesis of single amino acids. A better approach may be to exchange regions between related receptors, and then measure gain or loss of binding affinity related to the particular exchanged domain. In the current study, this approach was employed to identify regions in TP receptors conferring species-specific differences in 125I-BOP binding affinity. Analysis of chimeras was followed by site-directed mutagenesis of single and combined nonconserved amino acids in the region of interest. Our results indicate that multiple regions of TP receptors, including the first transmembrane-spanning domain, are necessary for high affinity 125I-BOP binding. Within the first transmembrane domain, a combination of Leu37 with either Ala36 or Gly40 is necessary to produce a high affinity receptor. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) was employed in polymerase chain reaction construction of mutant receptors. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Altered Sites kit from Promega. All radionucleotides were purchased from DuPont NEN. DNA Sequenase II kits were from U.S. Biolabs. 125I-BOP and125I-PTA-OH were synthesized as described previously (15Dorn G.W., II J. Clin.

TP chimeras were engineered by combining rat and human TP cDNAs at common existing restriction sites or at silent restriction sites created by mutagenic substitution of one or two nucleotides as described in TableI. All splice sites used were in one of the transmembrane-spanning domains. Therefore, the chimeric receptor nomenclature employed reflects the transmembrane domain of the splice site. The initial designation, R or H, is the species of origin (rat or human) of the amino terminus of the receptor, followed by a numeral describing the transmembrane domain wherein the two receptors were joined. The splice site is indicated by a slash, and a letter designating the species of origin of the carboxyl portion of the receptor follows.Table IMutagenesis protocol for insertion of silent restriction sitesChimeraEnzymeHuman TPαRat TPRestriction siteMutagenesisRestriction siteMutagenesisTP R7/HXhoIIbp 902Nonebp 893NoneTP R1/H and TP H1/RBstXIbp 129Nonebp 129NoneTP R2/H and TP H2/RBstEIIbp 237T243 → C, creation of BstEII sitebp 234NoneTP R4/H and TP H4/RNotIbp 473Nonebp 470G470 → C and G476 → C, creation of NotI siteChimeric receptors were constructed using restriction sites at analogous positions in the human and rat TP cDNAs.

The mutagenesis protocol for insertion of silent restriction sites is described in Table I, and the approximate location of the sites is depicted in Fig. 1. Oligonucleotides encoding specific mutations included 10 nucleotides flanking each side of the mutation and were employed for mutagenesis exactly as described previously (14D'Angelo D.D. Eubank J.J.

All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and all chimeric receptors were constructed by three-way ligation into the expression vector pcDNA3. Receptor chimeras were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutant/chimeric receptors, in which specific individual or groups of amino acids within the human fragment of a chimeric receptor were mutated back to their rat analogs, were constructed using polymerase chain reaction and antisense or sense strand primers encoding the mutations. All PCR-generated mutations were confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing using Sequenase. Wild type human TPα and rat TP were stably expressed in HEK293 cells as described previously (14D'Angelo D.D. Eubank J.J. Davis M.G. Dorn G.W., II. J. Biol.

Ther. 1994; 271: 1034-1041PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant receptors were transiently transfected in HEK293 cells using calcium phosphate precipitation. Nontransfected HEK293 cells have no thromboxane receptor expression defined by the absence of specific binding of 125I-BOP and the absence of calcium signaling with U46619 (16D'Angelo D.D. Davis M.G. Ali S. Dorn G.W., II J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 1034-1041PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were prepared for equilibrium binding of 125I-BOP and competition with nonradioactive thromboxane analogs using methods we have previously reported (16D'Angelo D.D. Davis M.G. Ali S. Dorn G.W., II J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 1034-1041PubMed Google Scholar). Binding competition experiments were computer-fitted to nonlinear models using the LIGAND program (17Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar), and the following parameters were derived: Kd(dissociation constant), Bmax (maximal binding capacity), and nonspecific binding. In competition binding using different structural analogs of thromboxane or prostaglandin endoperoxides, Ki values were generated from IC50 values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (18Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar). All binding studies fit best to a single binding site model. Data are reported as mean ± S.E. Comparisons of binding constants were by unpaired t test (two receptors) or by one-way analysis of variance (multiple receptors), and individual means were compared by the Bonferroni procedure using Sigma Stat software. Comparisons between the rank order binding affinities for various thromboxane analogs were performed using a Spearman rank order correlation test. Statistical significance was assumed at p < 0.05. It has been recognized for some time that there are species-specific differences in ligand binding to thromboxane receptors (19Dorn G.W., II Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: R145-R153PubMed Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the observation that rat TP exhibit an approximately 10-fold higher affinity for the TP agonist I-BOP than human TPα (3Dorn G.W., II Becker M.W. Davis M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24897-24905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7D'Angelo D.D. Terasawa T. Carlisle S.J. Dorn G.W., II Lynch K.R. Prostaglandins. 1996; 52: 303-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 compares the amino acid sequence of these two TP receptors. Wild type rat TP bound 125I-BOP with a 7-fold higher affinity than did human TPα expressed in the same cell line using the same expression vector (Table II and Fig.2 A). Thus, differences in ligand binding are unlikely to be attributable to variations in cellular milieu. TheKi values for several stable thromboxane or endoperoxide analogs possessing either agonist or antagonist activity at thromboxane receptors are compared for transfected rat and human TP in Table II. Of the nine compounds tested, significant differences in affinity were observed in five, including the antagonist SQ29548 (Fig.2 B). Interestingly, and despite the structural similarity of the two compounds, rat TP exhibited higher affinity for I-BOP but lower affinity for SQ29548 (Table II). The rank order of binding affinity for these nine compounds in human and rat TP was highly correlated (correlation coefficient = 0.916, p < 0.001).Table IIComparison of ligand binding affinities for human TPα and rat TPTPαRankRat TPRankp valueKiaFor I-BOP, Kd andBmax values are given.KiaFor I-BOP, Kd andBmax values are given.AgonistsI-BOP4.0 ± 0.5 nm (8)20.6 ± 0.07 nm (8)10.001157,516 ± 19,266 sites/cell124,499 ± 13,022 sites/cellU4661960 ± 3.7 nm (6)541 ± 6 nm (6)40.257U4406977 ± 7 nm (6)677 ± 11 nm (6)60.339CTA2284 ± 31 nm (8)783 ± 4 nm (6)60.001AntagonistsSQ2954813 ± 2 nm (13)334 ± 4 nm (15)40.004I-PTA-0H300 ± 34 nm (8)7365 ± 17 nm (8)80.319I-SAP0.44 ± 0.05 nm (6)10.34 ± 0.1 nm (6)10.53113-APA50 ± 3.3 μm (6)937 ± 2.6 μm (6)90.014PTA227 ± 1.7 nm (6)414 ± 1 nm (6)30.001All values were calculated from [125I]BOP competition binding experiments.

Agonists I-BOP and CTA2 and antagonists SQ29548 and PTA2 were the only compounds that exhibited significant differences in binding affinities for human and rat TP. Since the above studies demonstrated significant differences between rat TP and human TPα binding affinity for I-BOP and SQ29548, we reasoned that identification of structural determinants of species-specific ligand binding could be achieved by substitution of human TPα regions in rat TP. A series of rat/human TP chimeras was created by ligating appropriate cDNA fragments as depicted in Table I. The initial group of receptors that underwent characterization of ligand binding properties consisted of nine receptors: seven chimeras and the two wild type receptors. Mirror image chimeras were constructed having splice sites in transmembrane-spanning domains one, two, and four, and a rat/human TP chimera was constructed with a splice site in the seventh transmembrane domain. (It should be noted that transmembrane domain 7 is absolutely conserved in these receptors; thus, R7/H exchanges only the intracellular carboxyl terminus; see Fig. 1). All of the receptors studied, including wild type, chimeric, and mutant/chimeras (see below), showed levels of expression in excess of 125,000 receptors/cell. Each receptor was characterized using the radiolabeled agonist 125I-BOP, since preliminary binding studies to transfected rat TP and human TPα using the antagonist 125I-PTA-OH showed insufficient displaceable binding for meaningful analysis. I-BOP binding was characterized after transient expression of the TP chimeras in HEK293 cells and is summarized in Table III. The most interesting finding was that substitution of any segment of human TP for the analogous portion of rat TP, except the intracellular carboxyl terminus (TP R7/H), changed high affinity 125I-BOP binding to an intermediate affinity statistically distinct from that of either of the wild-type receptors. High affinity I-BOP binding was lost even with substitution of only the extracellular amino terminus and a portion of the first transmembrane-spanning region (TP H1/R). This result indicates that one or more domains between amino acids 3 and 40 (inclusive) of rat TP is necessary for high affinity125I-BOP binding. The additional observation that TP R4/H exhibited intermediate affinity for I-BOP but that TP R7/H exhibited high I-BOP affinity shows that, at a minimum, some portion of transmembrane domains 4–6 is also necessary for high affinity interactions with 125I-BOP.Table IIILigand binding characteristics of human/rat TP ChimerasReceptorI-BOPKdSQ29548 KinmnmTPα4.0 ± 0.5 (8)ap < 0.05 compared with Rat TP.13 ± 2 (13)Rat TP0.6 ± 0.07 (8)bp < 0.05 compared with TPα.34 ± 4 (15)TP H1/R1.9 ± 0.3 (7)ap < 0.05 compared with Rat TP.,bp < 0.05 compared with TPα.98 ± 11 (5)TP R1/H1.9 ± 0.4 (5)ap < 0.05 compared with Rat TP.,bp < 0.05 compared with TPα.54 ± 4 (5)TP H2/R2.6 ± 0.3 (5)ap < 0.05 compared with Rat TP.,bp < 0.05 compared with TPα.52 ± 9 (3)TP R2/H1.6 ± 0.1 (5)ap < 0.05 compared with Rat TP.,bp < 0.05 compared with TPα.60 ± 7 (5)TP H4/R2.0 ± 0.2 (6)ap < 0.05 compared with Rat TP.,bp < 0.05 compared with TPα.37 ± 4 (5)TP R4/H2.1 ± 0.5 (5)ap < 0.05 compared with Rat TP.,bp < 0.05 compared with TPα.21 ± 2 (5)TP R7/H0.3 ± 0.02 (6)3-bp < 0.05 compared with TPα.32 ± 4 (5)All values were calculated from [125I]BOP competition binding experiments as described in the Table II legend.

Data are means of duplicate determinations ± S.E. for n experiments per compound. To assess whether TP structural features necessary for high affinity I-BOP and SQ29548 interactions were shared, the I-BOPKd and SQ29548 Ki for wild-type and chimeric TP were compared. As shown in Fig. 3, there was no correlation, indicating that the determinants of (agonist) I-BOP and (antagonist) SQ29548 binding affinity differ substantially despite the structural similarity in these two compounds (see Fig. 2). This analysis did however, support the statistical grouping of I-BOP binding into high, intermediate, and low affinity groups. The above studies assayed TP chimeras for decreased 125I-BOP binding affinity to localize regions of rat TP that were important determinants of high affinity ligand interactions. Based on the surprising finding that TP H1/R had diminished I-BOP affinity compared with rat TP and our conclusion that amino acids within rat TP amino-terminal/first transmembrane-spanning region must confer high affinity for 125I-BOP, we employed PCR mutagenesis to replace groups of human amino acids in this region of TP H1/R with their rat counterparts. In this manner, a series of mutant/chimeric TP receptors with transmembrane domains 2–7 of the rat receptor and transmembrane domain 1 of the human receptor was created. Select mutations then reverted distinct nonhomologous amino acids in the first transmembrane domain to the rat counterparts. It was anticipated that replacement of functionally important amino acids with their rat analogs would, in the context of TP H1/R, restore125I-BOP binding characteristics to those of wild type rat TP. Initially, the four divergent amino-terminal amino acids were substituted en bloc, as were the three divergent amino acids within the first transmembrane domain. As depicted in Fig.4, replacement of the extracellular domain amino acids with their rat counterparts had no effect on 125I-BOP binding, whereas replacement of the transmembrane amino acids rescued high affinity I-BOP binding. Since this indicated that amino acid(s) at position 36, 37, and/or 40 was necessary for high I-BOP affinity, each of these amino acids was individually replaced with the rat analog, again in the context of TP H1/R. Surprisingly, none of these individual amino acid substitutions was sufficient to rescue high affinity binding for 125I-BOP (Fig. 4). Therefore, to examine the possibility that two of these residues interacted cooperatively to confer high affinity for 125I-BOP, amino acids 36, 37, and 40 were mutated to their rat analogs in all three possible pairs. As depicted in Fig. 4, the combination of Leu37 with either Ala36 or Gly40 rescued high affinity I-BOP binding, whereas the combination of Ala36 and Gly40, like individual replacement of any of the three amino acids, did not. Purely as a matter of thoroughness, the binding affinity for SQ29548 was also determined for each of the TP mutant/chimeras. Consistent with our prior observation that the determinants of I-BOP and SQ29548 binding differ in these receptors, there was again no apparent correlation between SQ29548 and I-BOP binding affinities (data not shown). This study identifies cooperative interactions between pairs of amino acids in the rat TP first transmembrane-spanning domain that contribute to species selectivity in TP agonist binding. Leu37, paired with either Ala36 or Gly40 increased affinity for the agonist I-BOP but not the structurally related antagonist SQ29548. Furthermore, additional residues in transmembrane domain 4, 5, or 6 were implicated as also contributing to the high affinity I-BOP binding exhibited by wild-type rat TP. The experimental design employed herein took advantage of species-specific differences in ligand binding between rat and human TP. Previous reports (3Dorn G.W., II Becker M.W. Davis M.G. J. Biol.

Recently, D'Angelo et al. (7D'Angelo D.D. Terasawa T. Carlisle S.J. Dorn G.W., II Lynch K.R. Prostaglandins. 1996; 52: 303-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) directly compared the binding affinities of transfected human TPα and rat TP and found that, when transiently expressed in identical cell systems using identical expression vectors, rat and human TP differ in their affinity for I-BOP. The current study provides a mechanism that explains these observations. A comparative analysis of the binding affinities of nine thromboxane/endoperoxide analogs (four agonists and five antagonists) in HEK293 cells stably expressing the rat or human TP showed significant differences in the absolute binding affinities of five of the nine compounds. The rank order of ligand binding affinity, however, did not significantly differ between the rat and human TP. Thus, based on the current binding studies in transfected cells, on previously demonstrated similarities in cell signaling (3Dorn G.W., II Becker M.W. Davis M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24897-24905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7D'Angelo D.D. Terasawa T. Carlisle S.J. Dorn G.W., II Lynch K.R.

Ali S. Dorn G.W., II J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 1034-1041PubMed Google Scholar), and on the high percentage of shared amino acids between rat and human TP, these two receptors should most appropriately be considered as species variants of a single pharmacologic subtype. The similarities in rat TP and human TPα facilitated identification of ligand binding determinants using analysis of chimeric receptors. A general weakness in mutagenic structure-function analysis is differentiating between functional changes conferred by the characteristics of an individual amino acid from more general alterations in protein folding and tertiary structure. Substitution of portions of one receptor with another that is similar was anticipated to alter amino acids without changing the overall structure of the receptor. This approach was employed to analyze binding properties of various rat/human TP chimeras and demonstrated the following: 1) the intracellular carboxyl terminus of TP receptors does not play a regulatory role for I-BOP binding affinity, since chimera TP R7/H exhibited high affinity for I-BOP; 2) multiple receptor domains contribute to the high I-BOP binding affinity exhibited by wild-type rat TP. The latter conclusion derives from comparison of the binding properties of the six mirror-image chimeras constructed by ligating human and rat TP receptors within transmembrane domains 1, 2, and 4. Each of these chimeric receptors displayed an intermediate binding affinity for I-BOP. En bloc replacement of rat TP receptor transmembrane domains 4, 5, and 6 (but not 7; see TP R7/H) with the human counterparts or replacement of the extracellular amino terminus and the first transmembrane domains (TP H1/R) lowered the I-BOP binding dissociation constant from approximately 0.6 nm to 2 nm. Thus, a minimum of at least two separate regions of TP receptors are required for high affinity interactions with I-BOP. Interestingly, the determinants of I-BOP and SQ29648 binding differ, since no correlation was observed in the binding affinities of these two compounds to the wild-type and chimeric TP receptors. Since the first transmembrane domain is not generally recognized as a region of critical importance in ligand binding to G-protein-coupled receptors, we focused our efforts toward identifying individual amino acid determinants in this region. While the chimeric analysis assayed for “loss of function” (high affinity I-BOP binding), we utilized the TP H1/R chimera as the substrate for grouped or single amino acid mutagenesis with the goal of “rescuing” high affinity I-BOP binding. The most intriguing findings of this study relate to the requirement for cooperative interactions between Leu37 and Ala36 or Gly40 in the first transmembrane domain to restore high I-BOP binding affinity. A postulated mechanism whereby substitution of Val37 → Leu plus either Val36 → Ala or Ala40 → Gly increases I-BOP binding affinity in the TP H1/R chimera is illustrated in Fig.5. The shared substitution, that of Val37→ Leu, simply lengthens the side chain of amino acid 37 by a single carbon, extending the isopropyl group further into the putative binding pocket, thereby potentially facilitating interactions with I-BOP. The necessary co-substitutions have opposite effects, diminishing the size of the side chain of an adjoining amino acid (position 36 is continuous with position 37, and position 40 is one additional revolution of the α-helix), thus making room for the larger Leu37 side chain. This space-filling mechanism is supported by several observations: 1) each of the amino acids in positions 36, 37, and 40 of either receptor possesses a noncharged hydrophobic side chain, thus eliminating charge as a factor; 2) each of the two pairs of amino acid substitutions that restores high affinity binding involves the amino acid at position 37 and a spatially adjacent amino acid; 3) The required alteration in either substitution pair is an increase in length of the side chain of amino acid 37 with a compensatory shortening of the side chain of an adjacent amino acid. Unfortunately, these data do not identify the portion of the ligand interacting with these receptor domains. Regional variations in the degree of amino acid conservation between human and rat TP are illustrated in Fig. 1. The seventh transmembrane domain is absolutely conserved between these receptors and has previously been demonstrated to play a critical role in TP ligand binding (13Funk C.D. Furci L. Moran N. Fitzgerald G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 934-939PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, two of the three nonconserved amino acids in the first transmembrane domain were found to be necessary for species-specific high affinity I-BOP binding exhibited by rat TP. In contrast to these highly conserved regions of the receptor, the intracellular carboxyl terminus is hypervariable and did not affect ligand binding. This degree of variability may occur either because this region is not a critical determinant of receptor structure-function and therefore can accommodate frequent mutations or because this region is responsible for observed species differences in these receptors. To date, two forms of human TP receptors have been identified using molecular techniques, and these receptors differ only in their intracellular carboxyl terminus (5Raychowdhury M.K. Yukawa M. Collins L.J. McGrail S.H. Kent K.C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19256-19261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ligand binding properties of these two human TP receptors are identical. Furthermore, our laboratory has engineered a mutant human TP receptor lacking an intracellular carboxyl terminus by introducing a termination codon at amino acid position 320 and found that this truncated receptor has normal human TP binding properties with only mild impairment of calcium signal transduction. 2G. Dorn, unpublished results. Thus, several different avenues of investigation support the notion that the hypervariable carboxyl terminus is not directly involved in ligand binding to TP receptors The current findings, together with a prior mutagenesis analysis of the seventh transmembrane domain of human TPα (13Funk C.D. Furci L. Moran N. Fitzgerald G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 934-939PubMed Google Scholar) and studies of other G-protein coupled receptors that bind small molecules (20Fraser C.M. J. Biol.

Particular importance has been assigned to transmembrane domains 1 and 7 in determining ligand specificity and binding affinity (current study and Ref. 13Funk C.D. Furci L. Moran N. Fitzgerald G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 934-939PubMed Google Scholar). However, some studies have also suggested that residues within the first and second extracellular loop may influence ligand binding to TP receptors, perhaps by determining peptide folding and receptor conformation (14D'Angelo D.D.

Gettys T.W. Halushka P.V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 277: 1132-1139PubMed Google Scholar) have recently reported that TPα interactions with different G-protein effectors can modify receptor affinity for I-BOP. Because the binding domain for TP ligands is not well defined and even the orientation of thromboxane with different receptor regions is a matter of speculation, future studies will be needed to address these issues."

The new assay shows that polypeptide chain release activity is directly dependent on the presence of a stop codon in the ribosomal A-site. Termination of protein synthesis happens through stop codon recognition by polypeptide chain release factors RF1 or RF2 (1Caskey C.T. Scolnick E. Tompkins R. Goldstein J. Milman G.

Biochimie ( Paris ). 1996; 78: 577-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Prokaryotic and eukaryotic release factors have been identified by using a simplified assay. Charged fMet-tRNAfMet is bound to the ribosomal P-site via an AUG triplet. fMet-tRNAfMet·AUG·ribosome complexes are then exposed to release factors RF1 or RF2 in the presence of free stop triplets (11Caskey C.T. Tompkins R. Scolnick E. Caryk T. Nirenberg M. Science. 1968; 162: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Ribosomal peptidyltransferase catalyzes hydrolysis of the fMet pseudopeptide from P-site fMet-tRNA (12Caskey C.T. Weissbach H. Pestka S. Molecular Mechanisms of Protein Biosynthesis. Academic Press, New York1977: 443-456Google Scholar). The mechanism of termination induction by stop codon recognition is still unknown (13Tate W.P. Brown C.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2443-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In first termination models, release factors RF1 and RF2 were believed to recognize stop codons in a tRNA-like manner (12Caskey C.T. Weissbach H. Pestka S. Molecular Mechanisms of Protein Biosynthesis. Academic Press, New York1977: 443-456Google Scholar). The idea was supported by release factors and suppressor tRNAs competing in recognition of stop codons (14Capecchi M.R. Gussin G.N. Science. 1965; 149: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Studies by immunomicroscopy (15Tate W.P. Brown C.M. Kastner B. Hill W.E. Dahlberg A. Garrett R.A. Moore P.B. Schlessinger D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6537-6544Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) on the ribosome showed that, at least for stop signal recognition by release factors, the stop codon needs to be exposed at the ribosomal A-site. The authors pointed out that there is no evidence for a conformational change when the termination complex forms. Also, functional analysis of the release reaction points to a tRNA-like action of release factors in termination. Early biochemical studies showed that tRNA can induce release activity of peptidyltransferase in acetone (18Scolnick E. Milman G. Rosman M. Caskey T. Nature. 1970; 225: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Stop codon occupation of the A-site was not necessary. In ethanol, an excess of bulk tRNA induced fMet-ethyl ester formation. Furthermore, the study of the functional sites of release factors (19Pel H.J. Rep M. Dubbink H.J. Grivell L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5308-5315Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 20Moffat J.G. Donly B.C. McCaughan K.K. Tate W.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 231: 749-756Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) indicates that RF1 and RF2 might have a tRNA-like shape, spanning the codon recognition site and peptidyltransferase (21Tate W.P. Poole E.S. Horsfield J.A. Mannering S.A. Brown C.M. Moffat J.G. Dalphin M.E. McCaughan K.K. Major L.L. Wilson D.N. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Two studies have led to the proposal of a specific interaction between the terminal tRNA in the P-site and release factor RF1 (22Zhang S. Ryden-Aulin M. Isaksson L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or RF2 (23Arkov A.L. Korolev S.V. Kisselev L.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2891-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), as if the release factor is localized near the P-site tRNA. Recent publication of the structure of the ternary complex between EF-Tu·GTP·tRNA 1The abbreviation used is: EF, elongation factor. (24Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F.C. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) and its striking similarity to the structure of elongation factor EF-G (25Aevarsson A. Brazhnikov E.

A tRNA-like shape for release factors has repeatedly been proposed (21Tate W.P. Poole E.S. Horsfield J.A. Mannering S.A. Brown C.M. Moffat J.G. Dalphin M.E. McCaughan K.K. Major L.L. Wilson D.N.

A. 1996; 93: 5443-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, no one has yet reported a defined in vitro release assay that is dependent on stop codons in the ribosomal A-site. In 1983, Tate et al. (28Tate W.P. Hornig H. Luhrmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10360-10365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported termination by release factor in the presence of a sense codon-occupied A-site, using free stop triplet. In 1987, Buckingham et al. (29Buckingham K. Chung D.-G. Neilson T. Ganoza M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 909: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) presented results with an AUGUAA mini-mRNA. No release induction by release factors could be observed, and again, free stop triplet activated the reaction. These results brought up the question of whether a first step in stop codon recognition might occur before entry of this codon into the ribosomal A-site (13Tate W.P. Brown C.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2443-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Here we show release induction by AUGUAA and other chemically synthesized minimessengers. In all cases, stop codons were localized to the ribosomal A-site when binding the minimessage by fMet-tRNAfMet via an AUG codon in the P-site. Release induction of the different complexes by release factors RF1 or RF2 shows that exposure of a stop codon in the ribosomal A-site is necessary and sufficient for polypeptide chain termination. In several cases we observed partial release activation by free stop triplet, as previously reported (28Tate W.P. Hornig H. Luhrmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10360-10365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Buckingham K. Chung D.-G. Neilson T. Ganoza M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 909: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We find about 10 times higher activity of release factors RF1 and RF2 when a stop codon in the minimessage is exposed at the P-site compared with the use of a free stop triplet. The presence of a sense codon in the A-site inhibits release induction by free stop triplet. Release factor codon specificity and discrimination of out-of-frame stop signals are dependent on reaction time, competition with A-site-binding aminoacyl-tRNA, and ion concentration. RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized on an ABI synthesizer. Protection groups were eliminated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Purity and sequence were controlled by mass spectroscopy (30Limbach P.A. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Release factors have been purified from wild type strains (31Tate W.P. Caskey C.T. Spedding G. Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 81-100Google Scholar) or from overexpressed strains (32Adamski F.M. McCaughan K.K. Jorgensen F. Kurland C.G. Tate W.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Tight couple ribosomes were prepared (33Spedding, G., Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis: A Practical Approach, 1990, IRL Press, Oxford.Google Scholar). fMet-tRNAfMet(Subriden) was charged and formylated as described (31Tate W.P. Caskey C.T. Spedding G. Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 81-100Google Scholar). Ribosomal binding of f-[35S]Met-tRNAfMet fixes the AUG codon of a given RNA oligonucleotide to the P-site of the ribosome (34Caskey C.T. Scolnick E. Tompkins R. Milman G. Goldstein J. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 20: 367-375Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Ribosomes and tRNA were kept in an equimolar ratio (50 pmol/50 μl of complex mix). Free AUG triplets or AUG codon-containing minimessengers were used at 2.5 nmol in 50 μl of complex mix. 0.5 pmol of fMet-tRNAfMet·messenger·ribosome complex were incubated together with release factors in the presence or absence of free stop triplet (ionic conditions are stated for each series individually). Hydrolyzed formylmethionine was extracted with ethyl acetate at pH 1. Maximal release under these conditions was between 50 and 70% of the total f-[35S]Met present in the reaction mix. Assays were repeated two to five times with independently prepared complexes, and the results were averaged. Amounts of free fMet at zero time of each reaction series (3–8%) were subtracted. Different RNA oligonucleotides were fixed by charged f-[35S]Met-tRNAfMet to 70 S ribosomes. The complexes were incubated at different concentrations of release factors RF1 or RF2 and in the absence or presence of free stop triplet. In complexes where the A-site was not occupied by a stop codon, fMet release was dependent on free stop triplet addition and high release factor concentration (lines 1 and 2). Oligonucleotides presenting a stop codon to the A-site allowed termination in the presence of RF1 or RF2 at relatively low concentration and independent of free stop triplet (lines 7–9). Addition of 5′-UUC to a given messenger, presumably in the ribosomal E-site, did not change the release efficiency to a significant extent (lines 8 and 9). This was not changed in the presence of excess deacyl-tRNAPhe (data not shown). Free stop triplet release induction is dependent on the accessibility of the A-site and is efficiently inhibited when a sense codon occupies the A-site (lines 3–6) although an increase of release activity could be observed when a free stop triplet was added (lines 4, 6, 8, and 9), indicating a certain degree of breathing of the system in the present conditions. When the message was elongated 3′ from the A-site (line 7), free stop triplet slightly inhibited termination. We conclude that the system is not fully independent of effects due to free stop triplet in high excess. Release factors might recognize triplets in competition with the minimessenger before or after having been bound to the ribosomal complex. In addition, mRNA 3′ from the A-site might sterically inhibit access of free stop triplet to the A-site. To reproduce release factor codon specificity and stop signal frame specificity, minimessages with release factor specific stop codons or bearing incremental insertions between the AUG (Met) codon and the stop codon were synthesized. In classicalin vitro termination conditions established for the use of free stop triplet, our assay was only marginally specific against a +1 frame stop codon (line 3), and no specificity of RF2 against UAG recognition could be observed, even at a relatively low concentration of the factor (line 8). +2 or −2 out-of-frame stops were not recognized (lines 2 and 4). A stop signal that was localized an entire codon downstream from the A-site (Table II, line 1, and Table I, lines 4 and 5) was also not recognized.Table IIFidelity of stop signal recognitionE P ARF2 (5 picounits)RF2 (50 picounits)RF1 (15 picounits)fmol1) UUCAUGUUUUAA5152) UUCAUGUUUAA1510153) UUCAUGUUAA85135804) UUCAUGA50105) UUCAUGUAA2002152206) AUGUAA1791937) UUCAUGUGA80140258) UUCAUGUAG9019595E, P, A stands for ribosomal exit, peptidyl, and aminoacyl sites.

Methods Enzymol. 1971; 20: 367-375Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mg2+ has been shown to play a role in coordinating secondary structures of nucleic acids (e.g.Refs. 35Westhof E. Dumas P. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 119-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar and 36Pyle A.M. Science. 1993; 261: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) but also in coupling of ribosomal subunits and binding of nucleic acids (mRNA, tRNA) to ribosomes (33Spedding, G., Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis: A Practical Approach, 1990, IRL Press, Oxford.Google Scholar). The optimal Mg2+ concentration for in vitro termination (30 mm) has been established empirically (37Milman G. Goldstein J. Scolnick E. Caskey T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 63: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and is somewhat high compared with common Mg2+ concentrations (5–10 mm) used in translation in vitro assays (33Spedding, G., Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis: A Practical Approach, 1990, IRL Press, Oxford.Google Scholar). 30 mm is optimal for release reactions using free stop triplet, where the reaction is the third order (fMet-tRNAfMet·AUG·ribosome intermediate, stop triplet, and release factor have to form a complex allowing fMet-tRNAfMet hydrolysis). In our assay, a stop codon is already part of the fMet-tRNAfMet·messenger·ribosome intermediate. It was therefore reasonable to ask whether a lower Mg2+ concentration could be sufficient for a reaction of the second order, thereby allowing efficient discrimination of non-cognate stop codons. Release factor concentration was kept below saturation. By diminishing reaction time, we were able to show differences in activity of release factors for different stop codons. Fig. 1 shows that indeed stop codon specificity of RF1 and RF2 is directly dependent on incubation time and Mg2+concentration. At 8 mm [Mg2+], a clear difference in reaction velocity between specific and nonspecific reactions appeared. Codon-specific reactions were mostly completed within the first 30 s. Nevertheless, RF2 showed less codon specificity than RF1, which showed codon specificity over the entire range of Mg2+ concentrations tested. We then tested the effect of incubation time on frame specificity in stop codon recognition (Fig. 2). UUC AUG UAA GCC CC was used as a positive control for in-frame stop codon recognition. The +1 stop (UUC AUG UUAA) message, which had turned out to have poor discrimination (Table II), was tested together with +2 (UUC AUG UUUAA) and −2 (UUC AUGA) oligonucleotides. Recognition of out-of-frame stops decreased by half when the reaction time was reduced from 4 min to 30 s. We wanted to see whether a tRNA recognizing the cognate A-site codon would be able to compete with a release factor. In that case, the presence of a cognate tRNA in the A-site should diminish out-of-frame stop codon recognition by a release factor. It has been shown previously that it is possible to occupy a ribosomal A-site with a cognate aminoacyl-tRNA in the absence of EF-Tu when this site is programmed by a message (38Rheinberger H.J.

In Fig. 3 we show that, under our conditions, release factor recognition of a +1 frame stop signal on an UUC AUG UUA A is diminished 2-fold when the ribosomal A-site has previously been occupied by a UUA that decodes Leu-tRNALeu. This 2-fold inhibition was constant at 30 s and 5 min of incubation time. Use of uncharged tRNALeudid not result in enhanced out-of-frame stop signal discrimination. Our results (Table I) suggested a higher affinity of release factors for messages containing an A-site stop codon versuscomplexes dependent on free stop triplet addition. We therefore studied the kinetics of termination reactions dependent on release factor concentration, comparing the two systems (Fig. 4). Conditions of kinetics were the same as for Caskey et al.(34Caskey C.T. Scolnick E. Tompkins R. Milman G. Goldstein J. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 20: 367-375Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As previously shown, at a low concentration of release factors, fMet release is linear during the first 5 min, and the velocity is dependent on release factor concentration when using free stop triplet. 30 mm Mg2+ is optimal for efficient fMet release with free stop triplet. At the same release factor concentration, this reaction was completed after 1.5 min when using a stop signal on a minimessage. We therefore studied the kinetics of our assay at intervals of <1 min (Fig. 5). More than half of the reaction was completed within 10 s when using RF1, and within the limits of our experiments, we could not observe a difference in velocity at two different release factor concentrations. RF2 seems to react at least three times slower in comparable conditions. In both cases, a plateau is reached after <2 min. We conclude that this plateau corresponds to the actual amount of active release factor. In this case, 5 picounits of release factor activity (34Caskey C.T. Scolnick E. Tompkins R. Milman G. Goldstein J. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 20: 367-375Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) corresponds to 50 fmol of active protein. Continuation of the RF2 reaction after 2 min at a significantly lower level might be due to slow release of RF2 from previous termination complexes. Recognition of stop codons depends on participation of termination factors, which was initially suggested by Ganoza (39Ganoza M.C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1966; 31: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Capecchi (40Capecchi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 1144-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) used the mRNA of bacteriophage R17 to direct in vitroprotein synthesis programmed by a mutant with a stop codon at the sixth amino acid position of the coat protein. Release of the hexapeptide was shown to be dependent on the presence of protein factors (2Capecchi M.R. Klein H.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1969; 34: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A defined termination assay established by Caskey et al. (11Caskey C.T. Tompkins R. Scolnick E. Caryk T. Nirenberg M. Science. 1968; 162: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) measured release of fMet from an fMet-tRNAfMet·AUG·ribosome intermediate. The work described here presents an important improvement of the defined in vitro termination assay. We show that a minimessenger bound to the ribosome through interaction with an fMet-tRNAfMet is able to program termination by release factor recognition. A stop codon located at the A-site is necessary and sufficient for release factor-induced termination. UAG (with RF1) and UGA (with RF2) were less efficiently recognized than UAA with both factors. This is consistent with observations of Caskey et al. (34Caskey C.T. Scolnick E. Tompkins R. Milman G. Goldstein J. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 20: 367-375Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) in their system. In our initial experiments, RF2 recognized UAG as well as UGA. Reducing reaction time and Mg2+ concentration resulted in specific recognition of UAG and UAA by RF1 and UAA and UGA by RF2, although the fidelity of RF1 was higher than RF2 under tested conditions. In a previous publication (29Buckingham K. Chung D.-G. Neilson T. Ganoza M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 909: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), termination induction by release factors was reported when a stop codon was located one or two stop codons 3′ from the ribosomal A-site. We did not observe termination induction by release factors with stop signals located outside of the A-site. −2 and +2 out-of-frame stop signals were efficiently discriminated. However, a +1 out-of-frame stop codon was fairly active. Again, specific discrimination of this recognition was dependent on incubation time. Furthermore, the presence of a cognate aminoacyl-tRNA in the A-site competed with +1 out-of-frame stop signal recognition. Our results and conclusions are supported by kinetic comparison between free stop triplet and entire minimessenger in in vitrotermination. The activity of release factors with the fMet-tRNAfMet·messenger·ribosome complex is strikingly enhanced, resulting in an increase in velocity of 2 orders of magnitude. RF2-related termination appears to occur at least three times slower than termination by RF1. We do not know if this is due to lower affinity or a lower kcat of the factor. A lower activity rate of RF2 might be a reason for the observation that there are about five times more molecules of RF2 than RF1 present in an Escherichia coli cell (32Adamski F.M. McCaughan K.K. Jorgensen F. Kurland C.G. Tate W.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Additionally, a lower velocity in RF2-related termination might compensate for lower specificity in stop codon recognition. The new assay could provide insights in other aspects of translational termination. RRF, ribosomal recycling factor, has been shown to release mRNA from ribosomes after peptide release has occurred. Using an entire minimessage instead of separate triplets, our new assay might be able to determine factor requirements for ribosomal recycling after polypeptide chain termination.

https://openalex.org/W2333154497,"We have shown recently that a retrovirus vector expressing a natural mutant form of the PML-RAR alpha protein characteristic of human acute promyelocytic leukaemia can transform early chicken hematopoietic progenitors (Altabef et al., 1996). Neither truncated PML nor truncated RAR alpha alone could induce transformation which suggest that the two domains should cooperate for the oncogenicity of the fusion product. To further investigate the mechanisms of this co-operation, we have tested whether a truncated RAR alpha could cooperate with the v-erbB oncogene. This oncogene has previously been shown to co-operate with the rearranged thyroid hormone receptor, v-erbA, to transform erythrocytic progenitors. We show that v-erbB and a truncated RAR alpha co-operate when expressed simultaneously as independent products to transform very early chicken haematopoietic cells close to pluripotent stage. In addition, we show that v-erbB alters transcriptional abilities of RAR alpha by both enhancing its effects on RARE and reducing those on AP-1. Therefore, RAR alpha is able to co-operate with different kinds of proteins to induce transformation of early haematopoietic cells. This strongly suggests that RAR alpha are involved in the differentiation commitment of early haematopoietic progenitors during the normal process of haematopoietic differentiation. These data bring new insights in the mechanisms of oncogenic transformation by rearranged RAR alpha."
