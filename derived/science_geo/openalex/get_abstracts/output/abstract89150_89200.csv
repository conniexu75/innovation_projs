https://openalex.org/W2164515753,"We show that c-myc is an inducible gene that is regulated by specific growth signals in a cell-cycle-dependent manner. Specifically, agents that initiate the first phase of a proliferative response in lymphocytes (lipopolysaccharide or Concanavalin A) and fibroblasts (platelet-derived growth factor) induce c-myc mRNA. Within one to three hr after the addition of these mitogens to the appropriate cells, c-myc mRNA concentration is increased between 10- and 40-fold. This induction of c-myc mRNA occurs in the presence of cycloheximide and, therefore, does not require the synthesis of new protein species. Consequently, the induction of c-myc mRNA is not secondary to growth. In addition, c-myc mRNA is ""superinduced"" by the combination of cycloheximide and mitogen, a finding consistent with a model that a labile protein may regulate c-myc levels in these cells. Further, this work suggests a regulatory linkage between the function of two oncogenes--c-myc and c-sis--the latter being the putative structural gene for PDGF."

The ligand 3-N-[11C]methylspiperone, which preferentially binds to dopamine receptors in vivo, was used to image the receptors by positron emission tomography scanning in baboons and in humans. This technique holds promise for noninvasive clinical studies of dopamine receptors in humans."

https://openalex.org/W2073977957,"Elimination of limited areas of the cephalic neural crest in stage 9 or 10 chick embryos markedly reduced the size of the thymus gland or resulted in its absence. Small thymic lobes contained both thymocytes and epithelial cells but showed delayed development. Parathyroid and thyroid glands sometimes were reduced in size or missing from the normal location on one or both sides. Heart defects were consistently present. Thymus development may depend on direct interaction of mesenchymal derivatives of the neural crest with pharyngeal epithelium. Multiple defects, such as the Di George syndrome, may result from failure of neural crest derivatives to migrate and interact properly."

The subjects were reexposed to a small amount of shock 24 hours later, after which an in vitro measure of the cellular immune response was examined. Lymphocyte proliferation in response to the mitogens phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A was suppressed in the inescapable shock group but not in the escapable shock group. This suggests that the controllability of stressors is critical in modulating immune functioning."

https://openalex.org/W2001509055,"Cytogenetic analysis of leukemic cells obtained at diagnosis from 122 patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) disclosed chromosomal translocations in 36 cases. Two new nonrandom translocations were identified and found to be associated with specific immunophenotypes of the disease. The first, identified in 4 of 16 cases of T-cell ALL positive for sheep erythrocyte receptors (E+), involved the short arm (p) of chromosome 11 and the long arm (q) of chromosome 14 and was designated t(11;14) (p13;q13). The second, found in 7 of 23 cases with a pre-B-cell phenotype, involved the long arm of chromosome 1 and the short arm of chromosome 19; it was designated t(1;19) (q23;p13.3). A third abnormality involving a common breakpoint on chromosome 12 (band p12) was also identified. These two new differentiation-specific translocations suggest a mechanism for aberrant expression of genes that influence lymphoid cell growth and development, as well as leukemogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2138820324,"Evidence is presented that cells transformed by adenovirus type 12 are oncogenic because they escape from T-cell immunity. This effect is brought about by reducing the expression of class I transplantation antigens and is a function of the protein translated from the 13S mRNA, transcribed from early region 1a. These findings establish a novel mechanism by which transformed cells can acquire an oncogenic phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W2010926658,Corticotropin releasing factor in concentrations of 15 to 250 nanomoles per liter increased the spontaneous discharge frequency and decreased the size of hyperpolarizations after burst discharges in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampal slices. Concentrations greater than 250 nanomoles per liter also depolarized the cells. These excitatory actions of corticotropin releasing factor may involve a novel calcium-dependent process.
https://openalex.org/W2135005214,"The human T cell receptor for antigen (Ti) has recently been identified on IL-2 dependent T cell clones as a 90 kd disulfide-linked heterodimer comprised of one 49-51 kd alpha (alpha) and one 43 kd beta (beta) chain. These subunits are noncovalently associated with a monomorphic 20-25 kd T3 molecule. Here, we produce monoclonal antibodies to a human tumor (REX) derived from an earlier stage of thymic differentiation in order to determine whether clonotypic structures are expressed and to define the ontogeny of Ti. The results of SDS-PAGE and peptide map analyses indicate that an homologous T3-associated heterodimer is synthesized and expressed by REX. This glycoprotein shares several peptides in common with clonotypic structures on an IL-2 dependent T cell clone. In addition, similar Ti related molecules appear during intrathymic ontogeny in parallel with surface T3 expression. The latter findings provide the structural basis for the immunological competence observed exclusively within the T3+ thymocyte compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1490683983,"Antibodies against eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF-4A) were used to study the involvement of this factor in recognizing the 5' cap structure of eukaryotic mRNA. We demonstrate that an approximately 50-kilodalton polypeptide present in rabbit reticulocyte ribosomal high salt wash which can be specifically cross-linked to the 5' oxidized cap structure of reovirus mRNA (Sonenberg, N. (1981) Nucleic Acids Res. 9, 1643) reacts with an anti-eIF-4A monoclonal antibody. We also show that antibodies against eIF-4A react with a 50-kilodalton polypeptide present in a cap-binding protein complex obtained by elution from a m7GTP-agarose affinity column. Comparative peptide analysis of eIF-4A and the 50-kilodalton component of the cap-binding protein complex indicates a very strong similarity between the two polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W2041065606,"The recently reported amino acid sequence of rat angiotensinogen was subjected to a computer-assisted search for homology with known sequences stored in a data bank and found to be significantly related to that of plasma alpha 1-antitrypsin, itself a member of a family that includes antithrombin III and ovalbumin. An alignment of the four sequences shows indisputably the common ancestry of all four proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1576066788,"An acid-stable transforming growth factor (TGF) that interacts with epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors and is structurally related to EGF was isolated from serum-free culture fluids of Snyder-Theilen feline sarcoma virus-transformed rat embryo (FeSV-Fre) cells. Purification of this EGF-like TGF (eTGF) was achieved by molecular filtration chromatography and successive reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography steps on octadecyl support eluted with acetonitrile and 1-propanol gradients, respectively. Rat eTGF consists of a 7.4-kD single polypeptide chain that co-migrates with biological activity in dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels. Like preparations of a related TGF from human melanoma cells (Marquardt, H., and Todaro, G.J. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 5220-5225), but unlike EGF from rat, human, or mouse, rat eTGF has phenylalanine and lacks methionine. However, the sequence of the first 30 amino acid residues in rat eTGF is H2N-Val-Val-Ser-His-Phe-Asn-Lys-Cys-Pro-Asp-Ser-His-Thr-Gln-Tyr-Cys-Phe-His-Gly - Thr-(x)-Arg-Phe-Leu-Val-Gln-Glu-Glu-(Lys)-(Lys)-, which is significantly (20% and 28%) homologous to the NH2-terminal region of mouse EGF and human EGF, respectively. In addition to eTGF, molecular filtration chromatography of acid-soluble extracts from medium conditioned by FeSV-Fre cells resolved a 14-kD transforming factor(s) apparently devoid of intrinsic mitogenic activity but able to elicit a strong anchorage-independent growth response in the presence of eTGF or EGF. These results show that: 1) a 7.4-kDa TGF structurally and functionally related to EGF has been isolated from FeSV-Fre cells and 2) the full anchorage-independent growth-promoting activity of medium conditioned by FeSV-Fre cells is due to the coordinate action of at least two types of factors, the 7.4-kDa eTGF and a second 14-kDa transforming factor(s)."
https://openalex.org/W2049704246,"Human T cell clones and monoclonal antibodies directed at their surface structures were used to define the receptor for the antigen and major histocompatibility complex on inducer T lymphocytes. The results indicated that the receptor is a single complex consisting of the monomorphic T3 molecule with a molecular weight of 20,000 to 25,000 and a clonotypic disulfide linked heterodimer Ti with a molecular weight of 90,000. Sepharose-bound monoclonal antibodies (anti-Ti4 or anti-T3) to the receptor could activate clonal proliferation and inducer function for B cell immunoglobulin secretion and thus substitute for the appropriate combination of major histocompatibility complex gene product and specific antigen."

https://openalex.org/W2050425590,"Stimulation of cultures of murine bone-marrow cells with specific macrophage growth factor (colony-stimulating factor I) resulted in the production of type I interferon. Neutralization of this endogenous interferon by antiserum directed against interferons alpha and beta resulted in a significant enhancement of mononuclear phagocyte proliferation from committed marrow precursors. The effect of the antiserum was lost in cultures depleted of adherent cells, an indication that an adherent regulatory cell (or cells) in the marrow limits mononuclear phagocyte proliferation by producing antiproliferative interferon in response to high levels of specific growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W2015376265,"Natural killer (NK) activity is a poorly understood component of the immune system, generally identified as the ability to kill certain tumour cells1,2. Perhaps the most controversial issue has been the lineage to which cells displaying this activity belong. Extensive studies of surface antigens on cells with NK activity in both mouse and man have led to enigmatic results, such cells apparently bearing markers of both T-cell (Thy-1 and E receptor) and myeloid (Mac-1 and OKM1) lineages3–6. A fresh approach to this problem would be to take cells of known lineage and test whether they express, or could be induced to express, NK cell function. Using this approach we show here that monoclonal cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines can be induced, by culture in high concentrations of spleen cell supernatant, to express a new lytic activity apparently identical with that of splenic cells NK activity. Preliminary evidence implicates both interleukin-2(IL-2) and interferon (IFN) as mediators of this phenomenon. These findings clearly demonstrate that cells of T cell lineage have the capacity to express NK activity."
https://openalex.org/W1593362658,"Purine and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside metabolism was studied in G1 and S phase human thymocytes and compared with that of the more mature T lymphocytes from peripheral blood. Both thymocyte populations have much higher intracellular deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools than peripheral blood T lymphocytes. The smallest dNTP pool in S phase thymocytes is dCTP (5.7 pmol/10(6) cells) and the largest is dTTP (48 pmol/10(6) cells), whereas in G1 thymocytes, dATP and dGTP comprise the smallest pools. While both G1 and S phase thymocytes have active deoxyribonucleoside salvage pathways, only S phase thymocytes have significant ribonucleotide reduction activity. We have studied ribonucleotide reduction and deoxyribonucleoside salvage in S phase thymocytes in the presence of extracellular deoxyribonucleosides. Based on these studies, we propose a model for the interaction of deoxyribonucleoside salvage and ribonucleotide reduction in S phase thymocytes. According to this model, extracellular deoxycytidine at micromolar concentrations is efficiently salvaged by deoxycytidine kinase. However, due to feedback inhibition of deoxycytidine kinase by dCTP, the maximal level of dCTP which can be achieved is limited. The salvage of both deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine (up to 10(-4) M) is completely inhibited in the presence of micromolar concentrations of deoxycytidine, whereas the salvage of thymidine is unregulated resulting in large increases in dTTP levels. Moreover, significant amounts of the salvaged deoxycytidine is used for dTTP synthesis resulting in further increase of dTTP pools. The accumulated dTTP inhibits the reduction of UDP and CDP while stimulating GDP reduction and subsequently also ADP reduction. The end result of the proposed model is that S phase thymocytes in the presence of a wide range of extracellular deoxyribonucleoside concentrations synthesize their pyrimidine dNTP by the salvage pathway, whereas purine dNTPs are synthesized primarily by ribonucleotide reduction. Using the proposed model, it is possible to predict the relative intracellular dNTP pools found in fresh S phase thymocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2150392258,"Properties of human anticentromere autoantibodies were analyzed. In intact cells or isolated cell fractions, these sera stain the centromeres of mitotic chromosomes and discrete speckles (prekinetochores) in nuclei. Staining is also retained in matrix preparations from nuclei or chromosomes. Immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting demonstrates protein antigens of 14, 20, 23, and 34 kd in HeLa nuclei and chromosomes; immunoprecipitates of nuclei also contain a protein of 15.5 kd. Matrix preparations contain only the 20, 23, and 34 kd species. Absorption of the anticentromere serum with any one of the four nuclear antigens immobilized on nitrocellulose is sufficient to eliminate centromere staining. Using a lysed cell model for microtubule nucleation, anticentromere sera are shown to inhibit specifically the organization of microtubules at the kinetochore."

https://openalex.org/W2080987494,Anti-idiotype reagents that recognize a common idiotype associated with the combining site of antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) were used to manipulate the immune response to hepatitis B surface antigen in BALB/c mice. The injection of antibodies to the idiotype before antigenic stimulation resulted in an increase in the number of cells secreting immunoglobulin M antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen. Anti-HBs-secreting cells were also induced by administration of antibodies to the idiotype without subsequent antigen exposure. These findings indicate that the immune response to hepatitis B surface antigen in mice is regulated through an idiotype-anti-idiotype network.

https://openalex.org/W1998292045,"Two mutants of the class I gene encoding the H-2Ld transplantation antigen have been constructed. In one mutant the cytoplasmic domain of the class I molecule has been altered by deletion of 24 of the 31 C-terminal residues, and in the second the C-terminal 25 residues of the cytoplasmic domain have been replaced with a unique sequence of 19 amino acids. These mutant class I genes have been transferred into mouse L cells by DNA-mediated gene transfer. Both mutant genes are expressed at normal levels on the cell surface, and they have charge properties and sizes consistent with the introduced alterations. These mutant Ld molecules can serve as target antigens for allogeneic cytotoxic T cells and as restricting elements for virus-specific cytotoxic T cells. These results show that the 24 residues replaced or deleted from the carboxy terminus of the class I molecule are not required for its transport to or integration in the plasma membrane, nor for its function as a target antigen or a restricting element during T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity."

https://openalex.org/W1529013613,"The major in vitro substrate for a tyrosine protein kinase in the particular fraction of the lymphoma cell line LSTRA is a protein of approximately 58,000 daltons (pp58). In order to determine if this phosphorylation is unique to the LSTRA cells, the particulate fractions from normal mouse T lymphocytes and another lymphoma cell line, YAC-1, were examined for the presence of pp58 phosphorylation. These two cell types were found to contain this phosphorylation, although in vitro pp58 phosphorylation is elevated approximately 20-40-fold in the LSTRA cells over that found in T lymphocytes or YAC-1 cells. A comparison was also made of the levels of tyrosine protein kinase activity among these three cell types. Tyrosine protein kinase activity was measured in vitro using an exogenously added synthetic peptide substrate and in vivo by determining cellular phosphotyrosine levels. The results of these determinations indicate that the LSTRA cell line contains an elevated level of tyrosine protein kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1590543334,"Human factor XII was activated by limited proteolysis with trypsin, and the resulting beta-factor XIIa (Mr = 30,000) was isolated by DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography. The complete amino acid sequence of beta-factor XIIa was then determined on peptides produced by enzymatic digestion with either trypsin, chymotrypsin, or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and by chemical cleavage at methionyl and tryptophyl bonds. beta-Factor XIIa is a glycoprotein composed of a heavy chain (243 amino acid residues) and a light chain (9 amino acid residues), and these two chains are held together by a disulfide bond. The carbohydrate is attached to asparagine residue 61 in the heavy chain. The amino acid sequence of the heavy chain shows a high degree of homology to the corresponding regions of other plasma serine proteases, such as plasmin, thrombin, factor IXa and factor Xa, as well as the pancreatic digestive enzymes. These results demonstrate that factor XII is the precursor of a typical serine protease that participates in the coagulation cascade."

https://openalex.org/W1591526065,"Human blood coagulation Factor XIa was reduced and alkylated under mild conditions. The mixture containing alkylated heavy and light chains was subjected to affinity chromatography on high Mr kininogen-Sepharose. Alkylation experiments using [14C]iodoacetamide showed that a single disulfide bridge between the light and heavy chains was broken to release the light chain. The alkylated light chain (Mr = 35,000) did not bind to high Mr kininogen-Sepharose while the heavy chain (Mr = 48,000), like Factors XI and XIa, bound with high affinity. The isolated light chain retained the specific amidolytic activity of native Factor XIa against the oligopeptide substrate, pyroGlu-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide. Km and kcat values for this substrate were 0.56 mM and 350 s-1 for both Factor XIa and its light chain, and the amidolytic assay was not affected by CaCl2. However, in clotting assays using Factor XI-deficient plasma in the presence of kaolin, the light chain was only 1% as active as native Factor XIa. Human coagulation Factor IX was purified and labeled with sodium [3H]borohydride on its carbohydrate moieties. When this radiolabeled Factor IX was mixed with Factor XIa, an excellent correlation was observed between the appearance of Factor IXa clotting activity and tritiated activation peptide that was soluble in cold trichloroacetic acid. Factor XIa in the presence of 5 mM CaCl2 activated 3H-Factor IX 600 times faster than Factor XIa in the presence of EDTA. In the absence of calcium, Factor XIa and its light chain were equally active in activating 3H-Factor IX. In contrast to Factor XIa, the light chain in this reaction was inhibited by calcium ions such that, in the presence of 5 mM CaCl2, Factor XIa was 2000 times more effective than its light chain. Neither phospholipid nor high Mr kininogen and kaolin affected the activity of Factor XIa or its light chain in the activation of 3H-Factor IX. These observations show that the light chain region of Factor XIa contains the entire enzymatic active site. The heavy chain region contains the high affinity binding site for high Mr kininogen. Furthermore the heavy chain region of Factor XIa plays a major role in the calcium-dependent mechanisms that contribute to the activation of Factor IX."
https://openalex.org/W1504546928,"Initial autophosphorylation of nonactivated rabbit skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase at pH 8.0 caused an increase in enzymatic activity that closely paralleled phosphorylation of the beta subunit. Peptide maps revealed that the first phosphate incorporated into the beta subunit during autophosphorylation was on the same tryptic peptide previously isolated from phosphorylase kinase that had been phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Cohen P., Watson, D.C., and Dixon, G.H. (1975) Eur. J. Biochem. 51, 79-92). When preincubated with phosphorylase kinase for one min, Ca2+ and Mg2+ synergistically stimulated subsequent autophosphorylation at pH 6.8. After this treatment phosphorylation of both the alpha and beta subunits became linear, and the first site phosphorylated on the beta subunit at pH 6.8 corresponded to the first site phosphorylated at pH 8.0. Removal of the lag as a consequence of the synergistic action of the metal ions allowed determination of a Km for MgATP of approximately 20 microM during initial autophosphorylation at either pH 6.8 or 8.2. With phosphorylase b as the substrate the Km values for MgATP under identical conditions were determined to be approximately 30 and 60 microM at pH 6.8 and 8.2, respectively. Initial rates of autophosphorylation over a 30-fold range of phosphorylase kinase concentrations suggest that incorporation of the first 1 to 2 mol of phosphate per alpha beta gamma delta tetramer occurs through an intramolecular mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1983740734,"The polyamine metabolism of transplanted N-nitrosomethylurea-derived rat glioma was determined with radiolabeled putrescine used as a marker for malignancy. The uptake of putrescine in vivo was complete within 5 minutes and was specific for tumor tissue. The conversion of putrescine to spermine and other metabolites by the tumor was rapid, in contrast to the case for adjacent normal brain. These results suggest that putrescine labeled with carbon-11 may be used as a positron-emission tomographic tracer for the selective metabolic imaging of brain tumor and may be used in an appropriate model as a marker for tumor growth rate."

The size of the protein is consistent with the potential coding region predicted from the c-myc nucleotide sequence, and is the same for malignant cells carrying either a rearranged or an unrearranged c-myc oncogene. Because c-myc transcripts are expressed at higher levels in malignant than in normal B cells, it appears that an increased level of the c-myc protein rather than a change in the gene product is the relevant factor in determining transformation."

During metamorphosis their vestibular and oculomotor coordinate systems undergo a 90 degree relative displacement. As a result, during swimming movements different types of compensatory eye movements are produced before and after metamorphosis by the same vestibular stimulation. Intracellular staining of central nervous connections in the flatfish with horseradish peroxidase revealed that in postmetamorphic fish secondary horizontal semicircular canal neurons contact vertical eye muscle motoneuron pools on both sides of the brain via pathways that are absent in all other vertebrates studied."
https://openalex.org/W1520927967,"The oligomerization of human endothelial cell-synthesized von Willebrand factor (vWf) has been studied by gel chromatography in columns of Sephacryl S-500 and by discontinuous agarose gel electrophoresis. A quantitative recovery of high Mr vWf oligomers has been obtained after binding to a monoclonal anti-vWf-Sepharose adduct. This reagent has been used to analyze gel filtration chromatographic elution profiles of [35S]methionine-labeled culture medium and cell lysate. It was determined that high Mr oligomers are present in endothelial cell lysates as well as in the medium overlying these cells and are composed of Mr 225,000 subunits. When vWf oligomers were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of a reducing agent, the Mr 240,000 subunit (provWf) was not observed to oligomerize beyond the dimer stage to a significant degree. Therefore, vWf oligomerization appears to be facilitated by conversion of provWf subunits to mature vWf subunits, most likely by proteolytic removal of sequences unique to the intracellular precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1528624835,"The H-2Kk glycoprotein has been isolated by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography, and an analysis of the asparagine-linked oligosaccharides present at the two major glycosylation sites has been performed. Antigen obtained from the AKTB-1b B-cell lymphoma that had been labeled with [2,6-3H]mannose for 5 or 21 h or for 5 h followed by a 5-h chase was digested exhaustively with trypsin. Each glycosylation site was then isolated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography using a C18 column. After removal from the peptide backbone by the almond emulsin peptide: N-glycosidase, the oligosaccharides from each isolated site were analyzed by gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography, concanavalin A affinity chromatography, and glycosidase treatment to assess the contribution of sialic acid and branching patterns of the oligosaccharide backbones to the overall microheterogeneity. The glycosylation of the H-2Kk antigen derived from several different AKTB-1b tumor preparations was examined during a period covering 1 year, during which time the tumor was passaged continuously in vivo in 2-week cycles. Our results conclusively demonstrate that the pattern of oligosaccharide microheterogeneity at the two glycosylation sites of the H-2Kk antigen derived from AKTB-1b cells is stable and that each site differs as to the specific array of oligosaccharide types found on the fully processed glycoprotein. In addition, this report describes an analytical scheme employing reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography to follow oligosaccharide processing and hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond by the peptide: N-glycosidase."

https://openalex.org/W1496349044,"The hydrolysis of sodium 3-dansylamidomethyl-7-beta (thienyl-2')-acetamido-ceph-3-em-4-oate, catalyzed by the beta-lactamase of Staphylococcus aureus PC1, has previously been shown (Anderson, E. G., and Pratt, R. F. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11401-11404) to follow the reaction scheme Formula; see text. where ES' is an enzyme-substrate complex in which the substrate has undergone nucleophilic attack at the beta-lactam carbonyl group and P is product. Acid quenching of the reaction mixture has now been shown to yield, in amounts predicted by the rate constants, a covalent enzyme-substrate complex. The liability of this complex in alkaline solution is suggestive of that of an ester. Together, all of these results prove that the turnover of this apparently normal substrate by a class A beta-lactamase involves an acyl-enzyme intermediate. In the case of another fluorescent substrate, dansylcephalexin, no intermediate analogous to ES' accumulated during catalysis; presumably here, acylation of the enzyme is rate-determining. The pH profiles (pH 4-9) of the pre-steady state rate constants for hydrolysis of the former substrate have also been determined. Binding (1/K8) is pH invariant except at low pH where it weakens, probably because of substrate protonation and/or a protein conformational change. The rate constants, k2, k-2, and k3, are pH invariant at low pH but decrease at higher pH in a way which can be described by ionization of an essential acid of pKa around 7.7. This may be the same acid for each constant, being either an active participant at the active site, or a more distant acid which controls an essential conformational change."
https://openalex.org/W2102809460,"The bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase has an intrinsic 3'-5' proofreading exonuclease activity that plays a central role in determining the fidelity of T4 DNA replication. In order to monitor this activity, we have measured the rate at which the polymerase decreases the size of a double-stranded DNA substrate in the absence of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. With this assay, we find that the addition of the polymerase accessory proteins, 45 protein and 44/62 protein, increases the rate at which the polymerase-associated exonuclease digests the DNA substrate 3- to 4-fold. This stimulation requires the continuous hydrolysis of ATP catalyzed by the accessory protein complex. When added alone, the T4 helix-destabilizing protein, 32 protein, inhibits the exonuclease rate at high concentrations (greater than 100 micrograms/ml), while stimulating about 3-fold at low concentrations. The 32 protein and the accessory proteins together increase the exonuclease rate 8- to 10-fold above that found for the polymerase alone. The bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase displays a similar 3'-5' exonuclease activity, but this exonuclease is not stimulated by any of the T4 replication proteins. It therefore appears that specific protein-protein interactions are involved."
https://openalex.org/W1547423734,"A procedure has been developed for the rapid purification of mouse interleukin 2 (IL2) to apparent homogeneity, using gel filtration, anion exchange, hydrophobic chromatography, and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). IL2 eluted at a high concentration of acetonitrile on HPLC (approximately 40%), well removed from other proteins. This protocol did not resolve isoelectric variant forms of IL2. Both the biological activity and protein migrated as a band of apparent molecular weight 22,000-23,000 on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It had a high potency, producing 30% of the maximal response in T cell growth at a concentration of 2-4 X 10(-12) M. Mouse Il2 synthesized in a wheat germ cell-free translation system behaved similarly on RP-HPLC as the form secreted by EL4 cells. Thus, the hydrophobicity of mouse IL2, which facilitates its purification, is an intrinsic property of the protein, determined primarily by its amino acid sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1487290492,"Deoxycoformycin-resistant rat hepatoma cells exhibit up to a 2000-fold increase in adenosine deaminase activity compared to the sensitive parental cells. The increased enzyme activity in these cells is accompanied by similar increases in 1) the amount of adenosine deaminase protein, 2) the relative rate of adenosine deaminase synthesis in vivo, and 3) adenosine deaminase mRNA activity. To further investigate the mechanism(s) responsible for the overproduction of adenosine deaminase in these cells, we have isolated a recombinant plasmid containing a 1.4-kilobase insert complementary to at least part of the adenosine deaminase mRNA. Using this cDNA as a specific hybridization probe, all deoxycoformycin-resistant variants were shown to have increased amounts of adenosine deaminase mRNA and gene sequences. The relative increase in the level of mRNA and gene copy number was similar to the relative increase in enzyme activity for most resistant cell lines. However, the degree of adenosine deaminase gene amplification in one deoxycoformycin-resistant cell line (6-10-200) was 3-4-fold less than the relative increase in adenosine deaminase mRNA. These results indicate that the increased adenosine deaminase activity in deoxycoformycin-resistant rat hepatoma cells is due in large part, but not exclusively, to gene amplification."

Native multimeric VWF (Mr = 1-20 X 10(6)) can be reduced with sulfhydryl reagents to a monomeric state (Mr = 2 X 10(5)). In this study, the binding of bovine VWF and ristocetin to bovine platelets was investigated using fluorescence anisotropy of derivatized monomer protein and ristocetin and also by radioisotope methods using 125I-labeled monomer and native protein. Ristocetin bound to bovine platelets but not to VWF. VWF binding to formaldehyde-fixed platelets was dependent on the presence of a promoter such as ristocetin. The monomer and multimer VWF bound equally well in the presence of low ristocetin concentrations. Under these conditions, plots of VWF binding versus platelet concentration were sigmoidal, indicating positive cooperativity with respect to platelets. At higher (100 micrograms/ml) ristocetin concentrations, the binding curve was no longer sigmoidal. Ristocetin promoted the formation of small platelet aggregates, an effect that was amplified by the presence of VWF. In fact, all conditions which resulted in monomer or multimer VWF binding to platelets also caused formation of platelet aggregates observed by light microscopy. These combined results were consistent with VWF binding only to the interface between proximal platelets. High affinity binding could be provided by the presence of two cell surfaces and the resulting multiple binding interactions. Polycations, such as poly(L-lysine) and Polybrene, also promoted the formation of platelet aggregates and facilitated the binding of VWF to platelets. Physiological platelet activators such as thrombin, ADP, and collagen also facilitated VWF binding to native platelets and caused platelet aggregation. It appears possible that any process which causes the surface membranes of platelets to become spatially close will allow expression of VWF activity."

Spectral evidence showed that the enzyme-bound hydroxocobalamin undergoes a Co beta-ligand exchange reaction forming sulfitocobalamin. Sulfitocobalamin was bound to diol dehydrase only loosely, and therefore dissociated from the enzyme. In contrast, neither the enzyme-hydroxocobalamin-5'-deoxyadenosine nor the enzyme-hydroxocobalamin-adenosine complex was resolved and thus re-activated by this procedure. It was shown spectroscopically that the hydroxocobalamin in these complexes does not react with SO2-3, or even with CN-, indicating that the OH group in the Co beta-position was blocked spatially by these enzyme-bound nucleosides. Neither O2-inactivated holoenzyme nor the holoenzyme inactivated suicidally by glycerol or 1,2-ethanediol during dehydration reaction was also re-activated by the same procedure. The complex of the enzyme with cyanocobalamin or methylcobalamin was not resolvable by the SO2-3 treatment. This was because these cobalamins bound to the enzyme were not subject to a ligand exchange reaction with SO2-3."
https://openalex.org/W1499643909,"We have synthesized and characterized 5'-bromoacetamido-5'-deoxyadenosine (5'-BADA), a new reagent for labeling adenine nucleotide binding sites in enzymatic and regulatory proteins. 5'-BADA possessed exceptionally high solubility and stability in aqueous buffers between pH 5.0 and 8.6 at 25 degrees C. A Dixon plot of data from enzyme kinetic measurements showed that 5'-BADA is a competitive inhibitor of NADH oxidation by 3 alpha,20 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase with a Ki value of 11.8 mM. This compares with a Ki value of 10 mM for adenosine under similar experimental conditions. Incubating 5'-BADA with a 3 alpha,20 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase at pH 7.0 and 25 degrees C caused simultaneous loss of both 3 alpha and 20 beta activity. The enzyme inactivation reaction proceeded by a first order kinetic process. The rates of enzyme inactivation as a function of 5'-BADA concentration obeyed saturation kinetics. 2-Bromoacetamide, at ten times the maximum concentration of 5'-BADA, had no measurable effect on enzyme activity during 25 h of incubation. NADH and AMP protected 3 alpha,20 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase against inactivation by 5'-BADA. The results suggest that 5'-BADA inactivates the enzyme by irreversibly binding to the adenine domain of the NADH cofactor binding region at the catalytic site of 3 alpha,20 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Irreversible binding follows from an alkylation reaction between the bromoacetamido side chain of 5'-BADA and an amino acid at or near the enzyme catalytic site. 5'-BADA is presented as a new reagent for selectively labeling amino acid residues at the adenine nucleotide binding sites of enzymatic and regulatory proteins."
