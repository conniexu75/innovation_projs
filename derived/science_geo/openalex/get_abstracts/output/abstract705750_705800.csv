https://openalex.org/W4312064742,"Studies of DNA methylation (DNAm) in solid human tissues are relatively scarce; tissue-specific characterization of DNAm is needed to understand its role in gene regulation and its relevance to complex traits. We generated array-based DNAm profiles for 987 human samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, representing 9 tissue types and 424 subjects. We characterized methylome and transcriptome correlations (eQTMs), genetic regulation in cis (mQTLs and eQTLs) across tissues and e/mQTLs links to complex traits. We identified mQTLs for 286,152 CpG sites, many of which (>5%) show tissue specificity, and mQTL colocalizations with 2,254 distinct GWAS hits across 83 traits. For 91% of these loci, a candidate gene link was identified by integration of functional maps, including eQTMs, and/or eQTL colocalization, but only 33% of loci involved an eQTL and mQTL present in the same tissue type. With this DNAm-focused integrative analysis, we contribute to the understanding of molecular regulatory mechanisms in human tissues and their impact on complex traits. As part of the enhanced GTEx (eGTEx) project, 987 human samples from 9 tissue types and 424 donors are assayed using DNA methylation microarrays. Colocalization of GWAS variants, eQTLs and mQTLs shows diverse links between genetic variation, molecular phenotypes and complex traits."
https://openalex.org/W4311282447,"Extended wakefulness is associated with reduced performance and the build-up of sleep pressure. In the cortex, this manifests as changes in network activity. These changes show local variation depending on the waking experience, and their underlying mechanisms represent targets for overcoming the effects of tiredness. Here, we reveal a central role for intracellular chloride regulation, which sets the strength of postsynaptic inhibition via GABAA receptors in cortical pyramidal neurons. Wakefulness results in depolarizing shifts in the equilibrium potential for GABAA receptors, reflecting local activity-dependent processes during waking and involving changes in chloride cotransporter activity. These changes underlie electrophysiological and behavioral markers of local sleep pressure within the cortex, including the levels of slow-wave activity during non-rapid eye movement sleep and low-frequency oscillatory activity and reduced performance levels in the sleep-deprived awake state. These findings identify chloride regulation as a crucial link between sleep–wake history, cortical activity and behavior. Alfonsa et al. show that wakefulness causes shifts in cortical EGABAA, weakening synaptic inhibition and resulting in markers of local sleep pressure, and identify Cl− regulation as a link between sleep–wake history, cortical activity and behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4311283135,"Abstract Cell adhesion molecules are ubiquitous in multicellular organisms, specifying precise cell–cell interactions in processes as diverse as tissue development, immune cell trafficking and the wiring of the nervous system 1–4 . Here we show that a wide array of synthetic cell adhesion molecules can be generated by combining orthogonal extracellular interactions with intracellular domains from native adhesion molecules, such as cadherins and integrins. The resulting molecules yield customized cell–cell interactions with adhesion properties that are similar to native interactions. The identity of the intracellular domain of the synthetic cell adhesion molecules specifies interface morphology and mechanics, whereas diverse homotypic or heterotypic extracellular interaction domains independently specify the connectivity between cells. This toolkit of orthogonal adhesion molecules enables the rationally programmed assembly of multicellular architectures, as well as systematic remodelling of native tissues. The modularity of synthetic cell adhesion molecules provides fundamental insights into how distinct classes of cell–cell interfaces may have evolved. Overall, these tools offer powerful abilities for cell and tissue engineering and for systematically studying multicellular organization."
https://openalex.org/W4311280479,"Abstract In the past decade, single-cell transcriptomics has helped to uncover new cell types and states and led to the construction of a cellular compendium of health and disease. Despite this progress, some difficult-to-sequence cells remain absent from tissue atlases. Eosinophils—elusive granulocytes that are implicated in a plethora of human pathologies 1–5 —are among these uncharted cell types. The heterogeneity of eosinophils and the gene programs that underpin their pleiotropic functions remain poorly understood. Here we provide a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic profiling of mouse eosinophils. We identify an active and a basal population of intestinal eosinophils, which differ in their transcriptome, surface proteome and spatial localization. By means of a genome-wide CRISPR inhibition screen and functional assays, we reveal a mechanism by which interleukin-33 (IL-33) and interferon-γ (IFNγ) induce the accumulation of active eosinophils in the inflamed colon. Active eosinophils are endowed with bactericidal and T cell regulatory activity, and express the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and PD-L1. Notably, active eosinophils are enriched in the lamina propria of a small cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and are closely associated with CD4 + T cells. Our findings provide insights into the biology of eosinophils and highlight the crucial contribution of this cell type to intestinal homeostasis, immune regulation and host defence. Furthermore, we lay a framework for the characterization of eosinophils in human gastrointestinal diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4311292694,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal, dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG trinucleotide expansion in exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Since the reduction of pathogenic mutant HTT messenger RNA is therapeutic, we developed a mutant allele-sensitive CAGEX RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13d system (Cas13d-CAGEX) that eliminates toxic CAGEX RNA in fibroblasts derived from patients with HD and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. We show that intrastriatal delivery of Cas13d-CAGEX via an adeno-associated viral vector selectively reduces mutant HTT mRNA and protein levels in the striatum of heterozygous zQ175 mice, a model of HD. This also led to improved motor coordination, attenuated striatal atrophy and reduction of mutant HTT protein aggregates. These phenotypic improvements lasted for at least eight months without adverse effects and with minimal off-target transcriptomic effects. Taken together, we demonstrate proof of principle of an RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13d system as a therapeutic approach for HD, a strategy with implications for the treatment of other dominantly inherited disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4311288198,"Early-life trauma (ELT) is a risk factor for binge eating and obesity later in life, yet the neural circuits that underlie this association have not been addressed. Here, we show in mice that downregulation of the leptin receptor (Lepr) in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and its effect on neural activity is crucial in causing ELT-induced binge-like eating and obesity upon high-fat diet exposure. We also found that the increased activity of Lepr-expressing LH (LHLepr) neurons encodes sustained binge-like eating in ELT mice. Inhibition of LHLepr neurons projecting to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray normalizes these behavioral features of ELT mice. Furthermore, activation of proenkephalin-expressing ventrolateral periaqueductal gray neurons, which receive inhibitory inputs from LHLepr neurons, rescues ELT-induced maladaptive eating habits. Our results identify a circuit pathway that mediates ELT-induced maladaptive eating and may lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for binge eating and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W4311258068,"Under the background of global response to climate crisis and environmental pollution, environmental regulation plays an increasingly important role in green technology innovation. This paper uses data from 280 Chinese cities from 2003 to 2019 to empirically answer the question whether environmental regulation can improve the level of urban green technology innovation. It is found that environmental regulation has a significant positive effect on green technology innovation. Under the heterogeneity of economic geographical region and resource-based city, environmental regulation has positive promoting effect on urban green technology innovation. Heterogeneity results also show that environmental regulation significantly promotes green technology innovation in central and resource-based cities, but does not significantly promote green technology innovation in eastern and western cities and non-resource-based cities. Further research shows that environmental regulation can promote the level of green technology innovation through the two transmission mechanisms of government technology input and foreign direct investment. For the Chinese local government which is implementing the policy of green economic transformation, the formulation of scientific regional environmental policy is beneficial to improve the level of green technology innovation, increase government technology input and optimize the foreign investment environment."

https://openalex.org/W4311216454,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains a lethal disease with a dismal overall survival rate of 6% despite promising responses to upfront combination chemotherapy. The key drivers of such rapid mortality include early metastatic dissemination in the natural course of the disease and the near guaranteed emergence of chemoresistant disease. Here, we found that we could model the regression and relapse seen in clinical SCLC in vitro. We utilized time-course resolved RNA-sequencing to globally profile transcriptome changes as SCLC cells responded to a combination of cisplatin and etoposide-the standard-of-care in SCLC. Comparisons across time points demonstrated a distinct transient transcriptional state resembling embryonic diapause. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that expression of the PEA3 transcription factors ETV4 and ETV5 were transiently upregulated in the surviving fraction of cells which we determined to be necessary for efficient clonogenic expansion following chemotherapy. The FGFR-PEA3 signaling axis guided the identification of a pan-FGFR inhibitor demonstrating in vitro and in vivo efficacy in delaying progression following combination chemotherapy, observed inhibition of phosphorylation of the FGFR adaptor FRS2 and corresponding downstream MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Taken together, these data nominate PEA3 transcription factors as key mediators of relapse progression in SCLC and identify a clinically actionable small molecule candidate for delaying relapse of SCLC."
https://openalex.org/W4311144200,"3-Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) is a promising drug target for coronavirus disease 2019 and related coronavirus diseases because of the essential role of this protease in processing viral polyproteins after infection. Understanding the detailed catalytic mechanism of 3CLpro is essential for designing effective inhibitors of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Molecular dynamics studies have suggested pH-dependent conformational changes of 3CLpro, but experimental pH profiles of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and analyses of the conserved active-site histidine residues have not been reported. In this work, pH-dependence studies of the kinetic parameters of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro revealed a bell-shaped pH profile with 2 pKa values (6.9 ± 0.1 and 9.4 ± 0.1) attributable to ionization of the catalytic dyad His41 and Cys145, respectively. Our investigation of the roles of conserved active-site histidines showed that different amino acid substitutions of His163 produced inactive enzymes, indicating a key role of His163 in maintaining catalytically active SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. By contrast, the H164A and H172A mutants retained 75% and 26% of the activity of WT, respectively. The alternative amino acid substitutions H172K and H172R did not recover the enzymatic activity, whereas H172Y restored activity to a level similar to that of the WT enzyme. The pH profiles of H164A, H172A, and H172Y were similar to those of the WT enzyme, with comparable pKa values for the catalytic dyad. Taken together, the experimental data support a general base mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and indicate that the neutral states of the catalytic dyad and active-site histidine residues are required for maximum enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W4311180244,"Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is a powerful method for measuring nucleic acid levels and quantifying mRNA levels, even in single cells. In the present study, we compared the results of single-cell qPCR obtained by different quantification methods (relative and absolute) and different reverse transcription methods. In the experiments, we focused on the cerebral giant cell (CGC), a key neuron required for the acquisition of conditioned taste aversion in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis , and examined changes in the mRNA levels of 3 memory-related genes, cAMP-response element binding proteins (LymCREB1 and LymCREB2) and CREB-binding protein (LymCBP), during memory formation. The results obtained by relative quantification showed similar patterns for the 3 genes. For absolute quantification, reverse transcription was performed using 2 different methods: a mixture of oligo d(T) primers and random primers (RT method 1); and gene-specific primers (RT method 2). These methods yielded different results and did not show consistent changes related to conditioning. The mRNA levels in the samples prepared by RT method 2 were up to 3.3 times higher than those in samples prepared by RT method 1. These results suggest that for qPCR of single neurons, the efficacy and validity do not differ between relative and absolute quantification methods, but the reverse transcription step critically influences the results of mRNA quantification."
https://openalex.org/W4311258064,"This study evaluated the associations of liver fibrosis biomarkers [non-alcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score (NFS), fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), aspartate aminotransferase/platelet ratio index (APRI), and BARD score] with mortality in Korean adults aged ≥50 years. We analyzed 7,702 subjects who participated in Dong-gu Study. The associations of liber fibrosis biomarkers with mortality were investigated using Cox proportional hazards models. Overall mortality increased with increasing NFS level [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 4.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.3–5.5 for high risk vs. low risk], increasing FIB-4 level (aHR 3.5, 95% CI 2.9–4.4 for high risk vs. low risk), and increasing APRI level (aHR 3.5, 95% CI 2.1–5.8 for high risk vs. low risk) but not with BARD score. The Harrell’s concordance index for overall mortality for the NFS and FIB-4 was greater than that for the APRI and BARD score. In conclusion, NFS, FIB-4, and APRI showed a significant relationship with the overall mortality, and NFS and FIB-4 showed a significant relationship with the CVD mortality after adjustment for covariates. In addition, the NFS and FIB-4 were more predictive of overall mortality than the APRI and BARD score in Korean adults aged ≥50 years."
https://openalex.org/W4311258073,"In this study, we newly sequenced the complete mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of two phytophagous scarab beetles, and investigated the deep level relationships within Scarabaeidae combined with other published beetle mitogenome sequences. The complete mitogenomes of Dicronocephalus adamsi Pascoe (Cetoniinae) and Amphimallon sp. (Melolonthinae) are 15,563 bp and 17,433 bp in size, respectively. Both mitogenomes have the typical set of 37 genes (13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, two ribosomal RNA genes) and an A+T-rich region, with the same gene arrangement found in the majority of beetles. The secondary structures for ribosomal RNA genes (rrnL and rrnS) were inferred by comparative analysis method. Results from phylogenetic analyses provide support for major lineages and current classification of Scarabaeidae. Amino acid data recovered Scarabaeidae as monophyletic. The Scarabaeidae was split into two clades. One clade contained the subfamilies Scarabaeinae and Aphodiinae. The other major clade contained the subfamilies Dynastinae, Rutelinae, Cetoniinae, Melolonthinae and Sericini. The monophyly of Scarabaeinae, Aphodiinae, Dynastinae, Cetoniinae and Sericini were strongly supported. The Scarabaeinae was the sister group of Aphodiinae. The Cetoniinae was sister to the Dynastinae + Rutelinae clade. The Melolonthinae was a non-monophyletic group. The removal of fast-evolving sites from nucleotide dataset using a pattern sorting method (OV-sorting) supported the family Scarabaeidae as a monophyletic group. At the tribe level, the Onthophagini was non-monophyletic with respect to Oniticellini. Ateuchini was sister to a large clade comprising the tribes Onthophagini, Oniticellini and Onitini. Eurysternini was a sister group of the Phanaeini + Ateuchini clade."
https://openalex.org/W4311263386,"In this study, we investigated the genomic variability of alpha-VOC of SARS-CoV-2 in Pakistan, in context of the global population of this variant. A set of 461 whole-genome sequences of Pakistani samples of alpha-variant, retrieved from GISAID, were aligned in MAFFT and used as an input to the Coronapp web-application. Phylogenetic tree was constructed through maximum-likelihood method by downloading the 100 whole-genome sequences of alpha-variant for each of the 12 countries having the largest number of Pakistani diasporas. We detected 1725 mutations, which were further categorized into 899 missense mutations, 654 silent mutations, 52 mutations in non-coding regions, 25 in-frame deletions, 01 in-frame insertion, 51 frameshift deletions, 21 frameshift insertions, 21 stop-gained variants, and 1 stop-gained deletion. We found NSP3 and Spike as the most variable proteins with 355 and 233 mutations respectively. However, some characteristic mutations like Δ144(S), G204R(N), and T1001I, I2230T, del3675-3677(ORF1ab) were missing in the Pakistani population of alpha-variant. Likewise, R1518K(NSP3), P83L(NSP9), and A52V, H164Y(NSP13) were found for the first time in this study. Interestingly, Y145 deletion(S) had 99% prevalence in Pakistan but globally it was just 4.2% prevalent. Likewise, R68S substitution (ORF3a), F120 frameshift deletion, L120 insertion, L118V substitution (ORF8), and N280Y(NSP2) had 20.4%, 14.3%, 14.8%, 9.1%, 13.9% prevalence locally but globally they were just 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.04%, 1.5%, and 2.4% prevalent respectively. The phylogeny analysis revealed that majority of Pakistani samples were grouped together in the same clusters with Italian, and Spanish samples suggesting the transmission of alpha-variant to Pakistan from these western European countries."

https://openalex.org/W4311328158,"Computation methods that predict the binding of peptides to MHC-I are important tools for screening and identifying immunogenic antigens and have the potential to accelerate vaccine and drug development. However, most available tools are sequence-based and optimized only for peptides containing the twenty canonical amino acids. This omits a large number of peptides containing non-canonical amino acids (NCAA), or residues that undergo varied post-translational modifications such as glycosylation or phosphorylation. These modifications fundamentally alter peptide immunogenicity. Similarly, existing structure-based methods are biased towards canonical peptide backbone structures, which may or may not be preserved when NCAAs are present. Rosetta FlexPepDock ab-initio is a structure-based computational protocol able to evaluate peptide-receptor interaction where no prior information of the peptide backbone is known. We benchmarked FlexPepDock ab-initio for docking canonical peptides to MHC-I, and illustrate for the first time the method's ability to accurately model MHC-I bound epitopes containing NCAAs. FlexPepDock ab-initio protocol was able to recapitulate near-native structures (≤1.5Å) in the top lowest-energy models for 20 out of 25 cases in our initial benchmark. Using known experimental binding affinities of twenty peptides derived from an influenza-derived peptide, we showed that FlexPepDock protocol is able to predict relative binding affinity as Rosetta energies correlate well with experimental values (r = 0.59, p = 0.006). ROC analysis revealed 80% true positive and a 40% false positive rate, with a prediction power of 93%. Finally, we demonstrate the protocol's ability to accurately recapitulate HLA-A*02:01 bound phosphopeptide backbone structures and relative binding affinity changes, the theoretical structure of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis derived glycosylated peptide GP392 bound to MHC-I H-2Db, and isolevuglandin-adducted peptides. The ability to use non-canonical amino acids in the Rosetta FlexPepDock protocol may provide useful insight into critical amino acid positions where the post-translational modification modulates immunologic responses."
https://openalex.org/W4311180279,"Cardiovascular diseases(CVD) remain the leading cause of death in the world and over 80% of all cardiovascular-related deaths occur in low and middle income countries. Ethiopia is in epidemiologic transition from predominantly infectious diseases to non-communicable diseases and the CVD is a major public health challenge.The aim of this study was to assess the magnitude and spectrum of cardiovascular admission and its outcomes among medical patients admitted to both Medical Ward and ICU of St. Paul Teaching Hospital from 1st of Jan 2020 to 1st of Jan 2021.Out of 1,165 annual medical admissions, the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases(CVD) was 30.3%. About 60%(212) of patients had advanced congestive heart failure of diverse causes. Hypertensive heart disease (HHD) was the next predominant diagnosis (41%(146)), and also the leading cause of cardiac diseases followed by rheumatic valvular heart disease(RVHD) (18%(64)) and Ischemic heart disease (IHD) (12.2%(43)), respectively. Yong age, rural residence and female sex were associated with RVHD(p = 0.001). Stroke also accounted for 20%(70) of CVD admission (hemorrhagic stroke-17% Vs Ischemic stroke-83%). Hypertension was the predominate risk factor for CVD and present in 46.7%(168) of patients. The mean hospital stay was 12days and in-hospital mortality rate was 24.3% with septic shock being the commonest immediate cause of death followed by fatal arrhythmia, brain herniation, and massive PTE.Cardiovascular diseases were common in the study area causing significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, comprehensive approach is imperative to timely screen for cardiovascular risk reduction, disease control and complication prevention. Strategies should also be designed to increase public awareness regarding the cardiovascular risk reduction, drug adherence, and possible complications."
https://openalex.org/W4311222766,"Objectives To investigate whether ultrasound findings of major salivary glands are correlated with serological markers, autoantibodies, patient- or doctor-reported disease activity in a Danish cohort of patients with primary Sjögren’s Syndrome (pSS). Methods In all, 49 patients at Odense University Hospital with pSS diagnosed according to the 2002 American-European Consensus Group (AECG) classification criteria were included. Patients were characterized using the EULAR Sjögren’s Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI, score of systemic complications) and EULAR Sjögren’s Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI), serologic markers, Schirmer’s test and salivary test. Salivary gland ultrasound (SGUS) was performed of the submandibular and parotid glands and scored according to the Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials (OMERACT) semi-quantitative scoring system. Results More patients with abnormal SGUS had antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (p = 0.002), anti-Ro52 (p = 0.001), anti-Ro60 (p&lt;0.001), anti-La (p&lt;0.001) and IgM-RF (p&lt;0.001). Titers for ANA (p = 0.02) and anti-Ro52 (p = 0.03) were higher in patients with abnormal SGUS. Twenty-three of the pSS patients had no pathological findings on SGUS. There was no correlation between SGUS severity and ESSDAI- or ESSPRI-scores. Conclusions Abnormal SGUS findings are associated with autoantibodies of high specificity for pSS but not with ESSDAI, ESSPRI or inflammatory markers."
https://openalex.org/W4311258067,"The aim of this study was to investigate the toxic effects and mechanism of silver nanoparticles (SNPs) on the cytological and electrophysiological properties of rat adrenal pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Different concentrations of SNPs (20 nm) were prepared, and the effects of different application durations on the cell viability and electrical excitability of PC12 quasi-neuronal networks were investigated. The effects of 200 μM SNPs on the neurite length, cell membrane potential (CMP) difference, intracellular Ca2+ content, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) difference, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) content of networks were then investigated. The results showed that 200 μM SNPs produced grade 1 cytotoxicity at 48 h of interaction, and the other concentrations of SNPs were noncytotoxic. Noncytotoxic 5 μM SNPs significantly increased electrical excitability, and noncytotoxic 100 μM SNPs led to an initial increase followed by a significant decrease in electrical excitability. Cytotoxic SNPs (200 μM) significantly decreased electrical excitability. SNPs (200 μM) led to decreases in neurite length, MMP difference and ATP content and increases in CMP difference and intracellular Ca2+ and ROS levels. The results revealed that not only cell viability but also electrophysiological properties should be considered when evaluating nanoparticle-induced neurotoxicity. The SNP-induced cytotoxicity mainly originated from its effects on ATP content, cytoskeletal structure and ROS content. The decrease in electrical excitability was mainly due to the decrease in ATP content. ATP content may thus be an important indicator of both cell viability and electrical excitability in PC12 quasi-neuronal networks."
https://openalex.org/W4311327770,"Low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) offers new functional neuromodulation opportunities, enabling stimulation of cortical as well as deep brain areas with high spatial resolution. Brain stimulation of awake sheep, in the absence of the confounding effects of anesthesia on brain function, provides translational insight into potential human applications with safety information supplemented by histological analyses. We examined the effects of tFUS pulsing parameters, particularly regarding pulse durations (PDs), on stimulating the cortical motor area (M1) and its thalamic projection in unanesthetized, awake sheep ( n = 8). A wearable tFUS headgear, custom-made for individual sheep, enabled experiments to be conducted without using anesthesia. FUS stimuli, each 200 ms long, were delivered to the M1 and the thalamus using three different PDs (0.5, 1, and 2 ms) with the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) adjusted to maintain a 70% duty cycle at a derated in situ spatial-peak temporal-average intensity (I spta ) of 3.6 W/cm 2 . Efferent electromyography (EMG) responses to stimulation were quantified from both hind limbs. Group-averaged EMG responses from each of the hind limbs across the experimental conditions revealed selective responses from the hind limb contralateral to sonication. The use of 0.5 and 1 ms PDs generated higher EMG signal amplitudes compared to those obtained using a 2 ms PD. Faster efferent response was also observed from thalamic stimulation than that from stimulating the M1. Post-sonication behavioral observation and histological assessment performed 24 h and 1 month after sonication were not indicative of any abnormalities. The results suggest the presence of pulsing scheme-dependent effects of tFUS on brain stimulation and attest its safety in awake large animals."

E. coli has two XPD/Rad3-like helicases, DinG, a damage-inducible helicase, and the putative helicase, YoaA. At the protein sequence level, yoaA contains seven conserved XPD/Rad3-like helicase motifs including a Walker A Box (nucleoside triphosphate binding), Walker B Box (nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis), and four cysteines believed to coordinate the iron in the Fe-S cluster (16Brown L.T.

Mutating one of these three conserved motifs causes yoaA to no longer confer azidothymidine (AZT) tolerance, implying these are necessary for the biological activity of YoaA (16Brown L.T. Sutera V.A.

In addition, yoaA expression is regulated by the SOS response in bacteria and is induced in the presence of DNA damage (21Courcelle J. Khodursky A. Peter B. Brown P.O. Hanawalt P.C.

The observation that holC or χ was required along with yoaA for DNA damage tolerance implicated DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (pol III HE) or the clamp loader unit of the holoenzyme in this pathway. However, χ was found to coelute with His-tagged YoaA from a Ni2+-sepharose column, whereas the ψ subunit of pol III HE flowed through the column and was not retained with His-tagged YoaA and χ (19Sutera V.A. Weeks S.J. Dudenhausen E.E. Baggett H.B.R. Shaw M.C.

Given that the only binding site for χ in the holoenzyme is on the ψ subunit, this result demonstrated that χ binds either YoaA or the pol III HE, but not both at the same time (24Olson M.W.

This work characterizes the fundamental biochemical activities of YoaA and its interactions with χ. Chi enhances the solubility of YoaA and a bona fide YoaA-χ complex forms when the proteins are overexpressed in vivo. YoaA-χ has the canonical XPD/Rad3-like helicase enzymatic activities including DNA-dependent ATPase activity, DNA/DNA unwinding activity, and translocates with a 5ˈ to 3ˈ polarity. This work is the first biochemical evidence of YoaA as an XPD/Rad3-like helicase, and given the tight binding of χ with YoaA, we propose that the physiologically relevant form of the helicase is YoaA-χ. The YoaA protein used in this work contains an N-terminal 6× histidine fusion tag (His-YoaA). Because YoaA contains four cysteines (C108, C168, C173, and C179) that are expected to coordinate four iron atoms to form a Fe-S cluster, media for expression of His-YoaA was supplemented with iron (II) sulfate (0.1 mg/ml) and ammonium ferric citrate (0.1 mg/ml) to supply additional iron for the formation of the Fe-S cluster. Purified fractions of His-YoaA had a yellow tint, indicative of an iron-containing protein. The presence of iron was verified using a colorimetric assay (see Experimental procedures). Overexpression of His-YoaA (72.6 kDa) alone from a pCOLADuet vector in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells produced a large fraction of insoluble protein after cell lysis (Fig. 1, lane 2, band at about 70 kDa). A small fraction of soluble YoaA was present in the soluble fraction that was enriched after purification by metal ion affinity chromatography (Ni2+ sepharose) (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4). When expressed alone, YoaA yields are low making it difficult to purify enough for biochemical assays. Overexpressing His-YoaA with χ increased the solubility of YoaA (Fig. 1, lane 7). His-YoaA was still present in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 1, lane 6), but the percentage of YoaA compared to other proteins in the insoluble fraction was reduced compared to cells overexpressing His-YoaA alone (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 6). Chi (16.6 kDa) copurified with YoaA on Ni2+ affinity and heparin columns (Fig. 1, lane 8). Mutation of Phe-64 to Ala in χ (χ F64A) weakens binding of χ to YoaA (19Sutera V.A. Weeks S.J. Dudenhausen E.E. Baggett H.B.R. Shaw M.C. Brand K.A. et al.Alternative complexes formed by the Escherichia coli clamp loader accessory protein HolC (x) with replication protein HolD (ψ) and repair protein YoaA.DNA Repair (Amst). 2021; 100103006Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The χ F64A mutant is soluble and expressed at high levels. His-YoaA and the χ F64A mutant were coexpressed to determine if higher yields of soluble His-YoaA could be obtained and His-YoaA could be purified from χ F64A. Expressing His-YoaA with the χ F64A mutant increased the solubility of YoaA, but the interaction between χ F64A and YoaA was too weak for the two proteins to copurify (Fig. 1, lane 12). Chi F64A was present in the soluble fraction indicating χ F64A was overexpressed but did not copurify with His-YoaA (Fig. 1, lanes 11 and 12). His-YoaA copurifies with χ on two successive columns, Ni2+ affinity and heparin column (Fig. 1). To verify that His-YoaA and χ form a protein complex and to determine the stoichiometry of the proteins, His-YoaA and χ were coexpressed, purified by Ni2+ affinity and heparin chromatography, and subjected to size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superose 12 column (Fig. 2A). Two peaks eluted from SEC between fractions 20 through 32 and these fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to identify the proteins corresponding to the peaks (Fig. 2, A and B). Fractions 23-25 contained two strong bands at approximately 70 kDa and 15 kDa, corresponding to the expected sized of His-YoaA and χ, whereas fractions 29-31 contained one strong band at approximately 15 kDa, corresponding to χ. The presence of the small χ protein in the early eluting fractions with the larger His-YoaA confirms the two proteins form a stable complex. Using protein standards ranging in size from 1.4 kDa to 670 kDa, the molecular weights of the His-YoaA–χ complex and χ were calculated from an average of two experiments to be 68.3 kDa and 13.1 kDa, respectively. The calculated molecular weight of the observed YoaA-χ complex (68.3 kDa) is smaller than the expected size of a 1:1 His-YoaA:χ complex (89.2 kDa). His-YoaA and χ were coexpressed and purified as above and were also analyzed using a different SEC column, a Superdex 200 Increase column. As on the Superose 12 column, His-YoaA and χ coeluted in the same peak. Calibration of the Superdex 200 column with standards gave an apparent molecular weight of 98.0 kDa for His-YoaA-χ (Fig. S1). Due to the insolubility of YoaA without χ and the observation that YoaA and χ form a tight complex, we focused on characterization of the enzymatic features of YoaA-χ. Helicases typically use ATP as the energy source for translocating along ssDNA, and mutation of the lysine in the Walker A motif of YoaA showed that YoaA needs to bind and hydrolyze ATP for AZT tolerance in vivo (16Brown L.T. Sutera V.A. Zhou S. Weitzel C.S. Cheng Y. Lovett S.T. Connecting replication and repair: YoaA, a helicase-related protein, promotes azidothymidine tolerance through association with chi, an accessory clamp loader protein.PLoS Genet. 2015; 11: e1005651Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Therefore, ATPase activity of YoaA was measured in vitro to determine whether ATPase is potentially coupled to translocation on DNA. An enzyme-coupled assay that links the conversion of ADP product to the oxidation of NADH was used to measure ATPase activity. ATP hydrolysis was not detected for YoaA-χ in the absence of DNA (Fig. 3A inset, red). However, when a 60-nucleotide (nt) ssDNA substrate (Table S2, substrate S1) was added, YoaA-χ hydrolyzed ATP showing that ATPase activity of YoaA-χ is dependent on DNA (Fig. 3A, black). The rate of ATPase activity of YoaA-χ was also dependent on the concentration of ssDNA, and the concentration of DNA required to achieve half-maximal ATPase activity, K0.5, is 35.7 ± 2.9 nM (Fig. 3B). Since ATPases require Mg2+ for coordination and catalysis, the optimal MgCl2 concentration for the ATPase activity of YoaA-χ for the same substrate (S1) was determined. The rate of ATP hydrolysis by YoaA-χ was dependent on MgCl2 concentration and 2.5 and 5 mM MgCl2 yielded the fastest rates of ATP hydrolysis (Fig. S2). YoaA-χ had no measurable ATPase activity in the absence of MgCl2 (data not shown). A FRET-based assay was utilized to measure the helicase characteristics of YoaA-χ. A 30-nt oligonucleotide labeled with Cy5 on the 5ˈend was annealed to a 55-nt oligonucleotide labeled with Cy3 on the 3ˈ end to generate a forked DNA substrate where the blunt end of the 20-nt duplex is labeled with a fluorescent donor (Cy3) and acceptor (Cy5) (Table S3, substrate F1) (Fig. 4A). The DNA substrate is bifurcated with a 10-nt ss overhang on the Cy5-labeled strand and 35-nt ss overhang on the Cy3-labeled strand. Due to the close proximity of Cy5 to Cy3, the fluorescence of Cy3 is quenched by Cy5. When YoaA-χ unwinds the entire 20-nt of ds DNA, the two strands will separate and Cy3 fluorescence will increase (Fig. 4A). Helicase reactions contained 2 mM ATP and 50 nM forked DNA (F1) and were initiated by adding YoaA-χ to DNA and ATP (Fig. 4B). The fluorescence intensity of Cy3 was converted to amount of DNA unwound by using the Cy3 signal of ds and ssDNA without YoaA-χ as low and high signals, respectively. YoaA-χ readily unwound this forked DNA substrate (Fig. 4B). The observed rate of DNA molecules unwound per time increased linearly with YoaA-χ concentration (Fig. 4C). It has been previously established that the Fe-S cluster in helicases, such as XPD, can quench Cy3 and Cy5 (3Pugh R.A. Honda M. Leesley H. Thomas A. Lin Y.

Ensemble and single-molecule fluorescence-based assays to monitor DNA binding, translocation, and unwinding by iron-sulfur cluster containing helicases.Methods. 2010; 51: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, under our experimental conditions, YoaA-χ does not significantly quench the fluorescence of Cy3 at the two highest concentrations used (20 nM and 50 nM) for this DNA substrate (Table S2, substrate S2) (Fig. S3). Lack of Fe-S–dependent quench is most likely due to having a small population of DNA molecules bound by YoaA-χ near Cy3 at any given time in our experiments. This FRET helicase assay is attractive because it gives a signal that can be measured directly as a function of time; however, a limitation is that any process that separates the donor and acceptor pair such as nucleolytic degradation of DNA will give a FRET signal. To verify that the FRET signal is due to helicase activity of YoaA-χ, the FRET helicase assay was complemented with a DNA gel helicase assay. A forked DNA substrate (50 nM, G1), containing a longer 5ˈ ssDNA overhang to maximize separation on a native gel, was unwound by 2 nM and 5 nM YoaA-χ in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (Fig. S4). DNA degradation by a nuclease was not detected in these gel assays nor was nuclease activity detected by a denaturing PAGE for an ssDNA substrate with a fluorescein located in the middle of the strand (data not shown). Together, these results confirm that YoaA-χ has DNA helicase activity which is responsible for the increase in fluorescence in FRET assays, and YoaA-χ is not contaminated with a nuclease. YoaA was coexpressed with χ F64A and purified away from χ F64A to obtain YoaA in higher yields to measure the rate of ATP hydrolysis and DNA unwinding of YoaA alone. In the absence of χ, YoaA had approximately an 85% decrease in ATPase and DNA unwinding activity (performed once, data not shown). Although these preliminary results suggest χ stimulates the activity of YoaA, it is possible that YoaA is unstable in the absence of bound χ. These experiments were performed with one preparation of YoaA χF64A and further characterization needs to be performed to confirm the role χ has with YoaA in the helicase complex. It is the translocation of helicases along ssDNA that separates annealed DNA strands, and XPD/Rad3-like helicases require ATP hydrolysis to translocate. To determine whether YoaA-χ requires ATP binding or ATP hydrolysis for DNA unwinding, unwinding activity was measured for a mutant enzyme and using nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs. The conserved Lys residue in the Walker A motif of YoaA was mutated to Ala (YoaA K51A) to reduce ATP binding and, therefore ATP hydrolysis. YoaA K51A-χ lacked ATPase activity (Fig. 3A inset, green). This confirmed that this K51A mutation results in an ATPase defective enzyme. The Walker A mutant was also unable to unwind DNA under conditions where the WT enzyme does (Fig. 4D). Given that the K51A mutation affects ATP binding, experiments were also done to determine whether ATP hydrolysis specifically was required for DNA unwinding by utilizing hydrolysis-resistant ATP analogs, adenosine 5ˈ-(γ-thio)-triphosphate (ATPγS) and adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP). Neither ATP analog supported DNA unwinding of the forked DNA substrate (F1) by wt YoaA-χ, and DNA unwinding did not occur in the absence of ATP (Fig. 4D). Together, these experiments show that the DNA unwinding activity of YoaA-χ is dependent on a canonical ATP-binding residue and on ATP hydrolysis. To determine how long the 5ˈ ssDNA overhang must be for YoaA-χ to efficiently unwind ds DNA, the rate of unwinding bifurcated DNA (50 nM) with a 10-nt 3ˈ ss overhang and either a 10-, 15-, 20-, or 35-nt 5ˈ ss overhang (Table S3, substrates F1-F4) was measured using the FRET helicase assay. Unwinding by YoaA-χ (50 nM) was barely detectable on a substrate with a 10-nt 5ˈ ss overhang (F2) under these conditions (0.8 ± 0.09 × 10−3 s−1) (Fig. 4E). The rate of unwinding doubled when the length of the 5ˈ overhang was increased to 15-nt (F3, 1.7 ± 0.1 × 10−3 s−1), increased eight fold with a 20-nt 5ˈ ss overhang (F4, 6.9 ± 1 × 10−3 s−1), and increased 16 fold with a 35-nt 5ˈ ss overhang (F1, 13 ± 4 × 10−3 s−1) when compared to a 10-nt 5ˈ ss overhang (Fig. 4E). XPD/Rad3-like helicases translocate in the 5ˈ to 3ˈ direction on DNA, and YoaA is predicted to translocate in the same direction (28Coin F. Marinoni J.C. Rodolfo C. Fribourg S. Pedrini A.M. Egly J.M.

Through the analysis of base station layout in cellular networks, using Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) as the optimization objective, we propose a Dynamic Base Stations Selection (DBSS) method in a cellular unit. This method enables the system to dynamically select the positioning base station when positioning target in the detection area. DBSS mainly include three steps: nearest base station calculation, layout of base stations analysis, and base station selection based on the target location. We mainly focus on the derivation of four-base station dynamic selection (DBSS4) and five-base station dynamic selection (DBSS5) algorithms. In simulation experiments, DBSS4 algorithm and DBSS5algorithm were compared with the state-of-the-art of BSs selection methods. The results show that our proposed method can achieve the exhaustive search in cellular cells and reduce more than 20% of the GDOP cumulative positioning error compared with the fixed four-base station selection algorithm. Meanwhile, the proposed method is more efficient, requires less running time and floating-point operations (FLOPs) than other comparison algorithm, and is independent of localization algorithms."

Furthermore, we used an ex vivo functional screen of 507 chemokines and cytokines to identify 44 proteins secreted from damaged BMSCs. Fibroblast growth factor-10 (FGF10) was most strongly associated with chemoresistance in AML cell lines. Additionally, expression of FGF10 and its receptors, FGFR1 and FGFR2, was increased in AML patients after chemotherapy. FGFR1 and FGFR2 were also widely expressed by AML cell lines. FGF10-induced FGFR2 activation in AML cell lines operates by increasing P38 MAPK, AKT, ERK1/2, and STAT3 phosphorylation. FGFR2 inhibition with small molecules or gene silencing of FGFR2 inhibited proliferation and reverses drug resistance of AML cells by inhibiting P38 MAPK, AKT, and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Finally, release of FGF10 was mediated by β-catenin signaling in damaged BMSCs. Our data indicate FGF10-FGFR2 signaling acts as an effector of damaged BMSC-mediated chemoresistance in AML cells, and FGFR2 inhibition can reverse stromal protection and AML cell chemoresistance in the BMM."

Currently, it is largely unkown if clinical outcomes of GBM patients can be improved by appointing a neuro-anesthesiologist for their cases. We aimed to evaluate whether the assignment of dedicated neuro-anesthesiologists improves the outcomes of these patients. We also investigated the value of dedicated neuro-oncological surgical teams as an independent variable in both groups.A cohort consisting of 401 GBM patients who had undergone resection was retrospectively investigated. Primary outcomes were postoperative neurological complications, fluid balance, length-of-stay and overall survival. Secondary outcomes were blood loss, anesthesia modality, extent of resection, total admission costs, and duration of surgery.320 versus 81 patients were operated under the anesthesiological supervision of a general anesthesiologist and a dedicated neuro-anesthesiologist, respectively. Dedicated neuro-anesthesiologists yielded significant superior outcomes in 1) postoperative neurological complications (early: p = 0.002, OR = 2.54; late: p = 0.003, OR = 2.24); 2) fluid balance (p<0.0001); 3) length-of-stay (p = 0.0006) and 4) total admission costs (p = 0.0006). In a subanalysis of the GBM resections performed by an oncological neurosurgeon (n = 231), the assignment of a dedicated neuro-anesthesiologist independently improved postoperative neurological complications (early minor: p = 0.0162; early major: p = 0.00780; late minor: p = 0.00250; late major: p = 0.0364). The assignment of a dedicated neuro-oncological team improved extent of resection additionally (p = 0.0416).GBM resections with anesthesiological supervision of a dedicated neuro-anesthesiologists are associated with improved patient outcomes. Prospective evidence is needed to further investigate the usefulness of the dedicated neuro-anesthesiologist in different settings."
https://openalex.org/W4311327580,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a useful molecular diagnostic tool for genetic diseases. However, due to the presence of highly homologous pseudogenes, it is challenging to use short-read NGS for analyzing mutations of the Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (SBDS) gene. The SBDS mutation spectrum was analyzed in the Chinese population, which revealed that SBDS variants were primarily from sequence exchange between SBDS and its pseudogene at the base-pair level, predominantly in the coding region and splice junction of exon two. The c.258+2T>C and c.185_184TA>GT variants were the two most common pathogenic SBDS variants in the Chinese population, resulting in a total carrier frequency of 1.19%. When analyzing pathogenic variants in the SBDS gene from the NGS data, the misalignment was identified as a common issue, and there were different probabilities of misalignment for different pathogenic variants. Here, we present a novel mathematical method for identifying pathogenic variants in the SBDS gene from the NGS data, which utilizes read-depth of the paralogous sequence variant (PSV) loci of SBDS and its pseudogene. Combined with PCR and STR orthogonal experiments, SBDS gene mutation analysis results were improved in 40% of clinical samples, and various types of mutations such as homozygous, compound heterozygous, and uniparental diploid were explored. The findings effectively reduce the impact of misalignment in NGS-based SBDS mutation analysis and are helpful for the clinical diagnosis of SBDS-related diseases, the research into population variation, and the carrier screening."
https://openalex.org/W4311327878,"Patients with heart failure (HF) often suffer from multimorbidity. Rapid assessment of multimorbidity is important for minimizing the risk of harmful drug-disease and drug-drug interactions. We assessed the accuracy of using the electronic health record (EHR) problem list to identify comorbid conditions among patients with chronic HF in the emergency department (ED). A retrospective chart review study was performed on a random sample of 200 patients age ≥65 years with a diagnosis of HF presenting to an academic ED in 2019. We assessed participant chronic conditions using: (1) structured chart review (gold standard) and (2) an EHR-based algorithm using the problem list. Chronic conditions were classified into 37 disease domains using the Agency for Healthcare Research Quality’s Elixhauser Comorbidity Software. For each disease domain, we report the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive of using an EHR-based algorithm. We calculated the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) to assess overall agreement on Elixhauser domain count between chart review and problem list. Patients with HF had a mean of 5.4 chronic conditions (SD 2.1) in the chart review and a mean of 4.1 chronic conditions (SD 2.1) in the EHR-based problem list. The five most prevalent domains were uncomplicated hypertension (90%), obesity (42%), chronic pulmonary disease (38%), deficiency anemias (33%), and diabetes with chronic complications (30.5%). The positive predictive value and negative predictive value of using the EHR-based problem list was greater than 90% for 24/37 and 32/37 disease domains, respectively. The EHR-based problem list correctly identified 3.7 domains per patient and misclassified 2.0 domains per patient. Overall, the ICC in comparing Elixhauser domain count was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.71-0.82). The EHR-based problem list captures multimorbidity with moderate-to-good accuracy in patient with HF in the ED."
https://openalex.org/W4311327879,"LARGE1 is a bifunctional glycosyltransferase responsible for generating a long linear polysaccharide termed matriglycan that links the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix and is required for proper muscle function. This matriglycan polymer is made with an alternating pattern of xylose and glucuronic acid monomers. Mutations in the LARGE1 gene have been shown to cause life-threatening dystroglycanopathies through the inhibition of matriglycan synthesis. Despite its major role in muscle maintenance, the structure of the LARGE1 enzyme and how it assembles in the Golgi are unknown. Here we present the structure of LARGE1, obtained by a combination of X-ray crystallography and single-particle cryo-EM. We found that LARGE1 homo-dimerizes in a configuration that is dictated by its coiled-coil stem domain. The structure shows that this enzyme has two canonical GT-A folds within each of its catalytic domains. In the context of its dimeric structure, the two types of catalytic domains are brought into close proximity from opposing monomers to allow efficient shuttling of the substrates between the two domains. Together, with putative retention of matriglycan by electrostatic interactions, this dimeric organization offers a possible mechanism for the ability of LARGE1 to synthesize long matriglycan chains. The structural information further reveals the mechanisms in which disease-causing mutations disrupt the activity of LARGE1. Collectively, these data shed light on how matriglycan is synthesized alongside the functional significance of glycosyltransferase oligomerization."
https://openalex.org/W4311328018,"In this study, we propose a predictive model TabLSTM that combines machine learning methods such as TabNet and Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM) with a complete factor library for stock index trend prediction. Our motivation is based on the notion that there are numerous interrelated factors in the stock market, and the factors that affect each stock are different. Therefore, a complete factor library and an efficient feature selection technique are necessary to predict stock index. In this paper, we first build a factor database that includes macro, micro and technical indicators. Successively, we calculate the factor importance through TabNet and rank them. Based on a prespecified threshold, the optimal factors set will include only the highest-ranked factors. Finally, using the optimal factors set as input information, LSTM is employed to predict the future trend of 4 stock indices. Empirical validation of the model shows that the combination of TabNet for factors selection and LSTM outperforms existing methods. Moreover, constructing a factor database is necessary for stock index prediction. The application of our method does not only show the feasibility to predict stock indices across different financial markets, yet it also provides an complete factor database and a comprehensive architecture for stock index trend prediction, which may provide some references for stock forecasting and quantitative investments."
https://openalex.org/W4311328149,"Abnormally high serum homocysteine levels have been associated with several disorders, including obesity, cardiovascular diseases or neurological diseases. Leptin is an anti-obesity protein and its action is mainly mediated by the activation of its Ob-R receptor in neuronal cells. The inability of leptin to induce activation of its specific signaling pathways, especially under endoplasmic reticulum stress, leads to the leptin resistance observed in obesity. The present study examined the effect of homocysteine on leptin signaling in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells expressing the leptin receptor Ob-Rb. Phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) and leptin-induced STAT3 transcriptional activity were significantly inhibited by homocysteine treatment. These effects may be specific to homocysteine and to the leptin pathway, as other homocysteine-related compounds, namely methionine and cysteine, have weak effect on leptin-induced inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation, and homocysteine has no impact on IL-6-induced activation of STAT3. The direct effect of homocysteine on leptin-induced Ob-R activation, analyzed by Ob-R BRET biosensor to monitor Ob-R oligomerization and conformational change, suggested that homocysteine treatment does not affect early events of leptin-induced Ob-R activation. Instead, we found that, unlike methionine or cysteine, homocysteine increases the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response gene, a homocysteine-sensitive ER resident protein. These results suggest that homocysteine may induce neuronal resistance to leptin by suppressing STAT3 phosphorylation downstream of the leptin receptor via ER stress."
https://openalex.org/W4311328155,"Introduction Electrical spinal cord neuromodulation has emerged as a leading intervention for restoring autonomic functions, such as blood pressure, lower urinary tract (LUT), bowel, and sexual functions, following spinal cord injury (SCI). While a few preliminary studies have shown the potential effect of non-invasive transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) on autonomic recovery following SCI, the optimal stimulation parameters, as well as real-time and long-term functional benefits of tSCS are understudied. This trial entitled “Non-invasive Neuromodulation to Treat Bladder, Bowel, and Sexual Dysfunction following Spinal Cord Injury” is a pilot trial to examine the feasibility, dosage effect and safety of tSCS on pelvic organ function for future large-scale randomized controlled trials. Methods and analysis Forty eligible participants with chronic cervical or upper thoracic motor-complete SCI will undergo stimulation mapping and assessment batteries to determine the real-time effect of tSCS on autonomic functions. Thereafter, participants will be randomly assigned to either moderate or intensive tSCS groups to test the dosage effect of long-term stimulation on autonomic parameters. Participants in each group will receive 60 minutes of tSCS per session either twice (moderate) or five (intensive) times per week, over a period of six weeks. Outcome measures include: (a) changes in bladder capacity through urodynamic studies during real-time and after long-term tSCS, and (b) resting anorectal pressure determined via anorectal manometry during real-time tSCS. We also measure assessments of sexual function, neurological impairments, and health-related quality of life using validated questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained (CREB H20-01163). All primary and secondary outcome data will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals and disseminated among the broader scientific community and stakeholders."
https://openalex.org/W4310908152,"Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a protein kinase that integrates multiple inputs to regulate anabolic cellular processes. For example, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) has key functions in growth control, autophagy, and metabolism. However, much less is known about the signaling components that act downstream of mTORC1 to regulate cellular morphogenesis. Here, we show that the RNA-binding protein Unkempt, a key regulator of cellular morphogenesis, is a novel substrate of mTORC1. We show that Unkempt phosphorylation is regulated by nutrient levels and growth factors via mTORC1. To analyze Unkempt phosphorylation, we immunoprecipitated Unkempt from cells in the presence or the absence of the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin and used mass spectrometry to identify mTORC1-dependent phosphorylated residues. This analysis showed that mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation is concentrated in a serine-rich intrinsically disordered region in the C-terminal half of Unkempt. We also found that Unkempt physically interacts with and is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 through binding to the regulatory-associated protein of mTOR, Raptor. Furthermore, analysis in the developing brain of mice lacking TSC1 expression showed that phosphorylation of Unkempt is mTORC1 dependent in vivo. Finally, mutation analysis of key serine/threonine residues in the serine-rich region indicates that phosphorylation inhibits the ability of Unkempt to induce a bipolar morphology. Phosphorylation within this serine-rich region thus profoundly affects the ability of Unkempt to regulate cellular morphogenesis. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel molecular link between mTORC1 signaling and cellular morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4311144747,"α-Isopropylmalate synthase (IPMS) catalyzes the first step in leucine (Leu) biosynthesis and is allosterically regulated by the pathway end product, Leu. IPMS is a dimeric enzyme with each chain consisting of catalytic, accessory, and regulatory domains, with the accessory and regulatory domains of each chain sitting adjacent to the catalytic domain of the other chain. The IPMS crystal structure shows significant asymmetry because of different relative domain conformations in each chain. Owing to the challenges posed by the dynamic and asymmetric structures of IPMS enzymes, the molecular details of their catalytic and allosteric mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we have investigated the allosteric feedback mechanism of the IPMS enzyme from the bacterium that causes meningitis, Neisseria meningitidis (NmeIPMS). By combining molecular dynamics simulations with small-angle X-ray scattering, mutagenesis, and heterodimer generation, we demonstrate that Leu-bound NmeIPMS is in a rigid conformational state stabilized by asymmetric interdomain polar interactions. Furthermore, we found removing these polar interactions by mutagenesis impaired the allosteric response without compromising Leu binding. Our results suggest that the allosteric inhibition of NmeIPMS is achieved by restricting the flexibility of the accessory and regulatory domains, demonstrating that significant conformational flexibility is required for catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W4311146237,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) is a transcription factor that regulates angiogenesis under hypoxic conditions. To investigate the posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism of HIF1α, we performed a cell-based screening to reveal potential cis-elements and the regulatory RNA-binding proteins that act as trans-factors. We found that LIN28A promoted HIF1α protein expression independently of the downregulation of microRNA let-7, which is also directly mediated by LIN28A. Transcriptome analysis and evaluation of RNA stability using RNA-seq and SLAM-seq analyses, respectively, revealed that LIN28A upregulates HIF1A expression via mRNA stabilization. To investigate the physical association of LIN28A with HIF1A mRNA, we performed enhanced crosslinking immunoprecipitation in 293FT cells and integrally analyzed the transcriptome. We observed that LIN28A associates with HIF1A mRNA via its cis-element motif ""UGAU"". The ""UGAU"" motifs are recognized by the cold shock domain of LIN28A, and the introduction of a loss-of-function mutation to the cold shock domain diminished the upregulatory activities performed by LIN28A. Finally, the microvessel density assay showed that the expression of LIN28A promoted angiogenesis in vivo. In conclusion, our study elucidated the role of LIN28A in enhancing the HIF1α axis at the posttranscription layer."
https://openalex.org/W4311180246,"Peer review is an important part of science, aimed at providing expert and objective assessment of a manuscript. Because of many factors, including time constraints, unique expertise needs, and deference, many journals ask authors to suggest peer reviewers for their own manuscript. Previous researchers have found differing effects about this practice that might be inconclusive due to sample sizes. In this article, we analyze the association between author-suggested reviewers and review invitation, review scores, acceptance rates, and subjective review quality using a large dataset of close to 8K manuscripts from 46K authors and 21K reviewers from the journal PLOS ONE’s Neuroscience section. We found that all-author-suggested review panels increase the chances of acceptance by 20 percent points vs all-editor-suggested panels while agreeing to review less often. While PLOS ONE has since ended the practice of asking for suggested reviewers, many others still use them and perhaps should consider the results presented here."
https://openalex.org/W4311180253,"Rabies is one of the most important zoonotic diseases that mostly affect children. We conducted a rabies education among 129 secondary school children (intervention group = 94 students, control group = 35 students) in two schools in southeast Bhutan and evaluated the effectiveness of the lesson by comparing the knowledge, perception and safety behaviour score about rabies before and after education. We also assessed the knowledge retention capacity of the students at three months post intervention. Our findings indicated that short rabies lesson significantly (P<0.001) improved the mean knowledge score from 19.98(±2.72) to 26.96(±2.24) in the intervention group. Similarly, mean scores for perception and safety behaviour improved significantly (P<0.001) from 10.77 (±1.89) to 13.95 (±1.36) and 9.809 (±1.85) to 12.97 (±1.54), respectively. Although the scores have reduced significantly (P<0.001) at three months post intervention, most of the rabies information was largely retained by the students. In control group, significant increase in mean scores were also observed for perception from 10.17 (±2.38) to 11.2 (±2.44) and safety behaviour from 9.14(±1.44) to 10.74 (±1.95) after 3 months of education. The finding demonstrate that a short rabies lesson is effective in improving knowledge, perceptions and understanding of dog bites safety behaviour among the school children. However, there is a need for a frequent awareness program, at least quarterly or half yearly. Rabies education should focus on critical points such as dog bites being the main source of rabies and the importance washing a dog/animal bite wound with soap and water, and visiting the hospital for medical advice following animal bites."
https://openalex.org/W4311180314,"Aims Understanding atypical forms of diabetes (AD) may advance precision medicine, but methods to identify such patients are needed. We propose an electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithmic approach to identify patients who may have AD, specifically those with insulin-sufficient, non-metabolic diabetes, in order to improve feasibility of identifying these patients through detailed chart review. Methods Patients with likely T2D were selected using a validated machine-learning (ML) algorithm applied to EHR data. “Typical” T2D cases were removed by excluding individuals with obesity, evidence of dyslipidemia, antibody-positive diabetes, or cystic fibrosis. To filter out likely type 1 diabetes (T1D) cases, we applied six additional “branch algorithms,” relying on various clinical characteristics, which resulted in six overlapping cohorts. Diabetes type was classified by manual chart review as atypical, not atypical, or indeterminate due to missing information. Results Of 114,975 biobank participants, the algorithms collectively identified 119 (0.1%) potential AD cases, of which 16 (0.014%) were confirmed after expert review. The branch algorithm that excluded T1D based on outpatient insulin use had the highest percentage yield of AD (13 of 27; 48.2% yield). Together, the 16 AD cases had significantly lower BMI and higher HDL than either unselected T1D or T2D cases identified by ML algorithms ( P &lt;0.05). Compared to the ML T1D group, the AD group had a significantly higher T2D polygenic score ( P &lt;0.01) and lower hemoglobin A1c ( P &lt;0.01). Conclusion Our EHR-based algorithms followed by manual chart review identified collectively 16 individuals with AD, representing 0.22% of biobank enrollees with T2D. With a maximum yield of 48% cases after manual chart review, our algorithms have the potential to drastically improve efficiency of AD identification. Recognizing patients with AD may inform on the heterogeneity of T2D and facilitate enrollment in studies like the Rare and Atypical Diabetes Network (RADIANT)."
https://openalex.org/W4311180383,"High-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPVs) cause almost all cervical cancers and a significant number of vaginal, vulvar, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers. HPV16 and 18 are the most prevalent types among HR-HPVs and together cause more than 70% of all cervical cancers. Low vaccination rate and lack of molecularly-targeted therapeutics for primary therapy have led to a slow reduction in cervical cancer incidence and high mortality rate. Hence, creating new models of HPV-induced cancer that can facilitate understanding of the disease mechanism and identification of key cellular targets of HPV oncogenes are important for development of new interventions. Here in this study, we used the tissue-specific expression technique, Gal4-UAS, to establish the first Drosophila model of HPV16-induced cancer. Using this technique, we expressed HPV16 oncogenes E5, E6, E7 and the human E3 ligase (hUBE3A) specifically in the epithelia of Drosophila eye, which allows simple phenotype scoring without affecting the viability of the organism. We found that, as in human cells, hUBE3A is essential for cellular abnormalities caused by HPV16 oncogenes in flies. Several proteins targeted for degradation by HPV16 oncoproteins in human cells were also reduced in the Drosophila epithelial cells. Cell polarity and adhesion were compromised, resulting in impaired epithelial integrity. Cells did not differentiate to the specific cell types of ommatidia, but instead were transformed into neuron-like cells. These cells extended axon-like structures to connect to each other and exhibited malignant behavior, migrating away to distant sites. Our findings suggest that given the high conservation of genes and signaling pathways between humans and flies, the Drosophila model of HPV16- induced cancer could serve as an excellent model for understanding the disease mechanism and discovery of novel molecularly-targeted therapeutics."

Placebo tests using traditional right-wing vote and data on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) before the pandemic outbreak indicate that the former does not correlate with health outcomes, and the populist share of the vote does not correlate with the latter. Hence, we find strong indications that right-wing populism relates to a poor response to the disease."
https://openalex.org/W4311263383,"The presence of Corynebacterium in blood samples can indicate true bacteremia or contamination, thus complicating the diagnosis of true bacteremia. We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of time to positivity (TTP) in diagnosing true bacteremia and contamination in cases where Corynebacterium was isolated from blood samples. We compared the TTP of the true-bacteremia group (n = 77) with that of the contamination group (n = 88). For the true-bacteremia cases that had only one set of positive blood cultures (n = 14), considering clinical and bacteriological data, additional cultures were performed on blood or other specimens. The same Corynebacterium spp. as in blood were isolated from these specimens. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated, and the sensitivity and specificity of TTP were calculated for diagnosing true bacteremia. The median TTP of the true-bacteremia group (26.8 h) was shorter than that of the contamination group (43.3 h) (P &lt; 0.0001). When considering TTP ≤ 25.0 h as true bacteremia, the sensitivity and specificity were 44.2% and 95.5%, respectively. Moreover, when considering TTP ≤ 69.4 h as true bacteremia, the sensitivity and specificity were 96.1% and 20.5%, respectively. Among the true-bacteremia groups with one set of positive blood cultures (n = 14), no case exhibited a TTP &gt; 69.4 h. Only three cases showed TTP ≤ 25.0 h in the true-bacteremia group with one set of positive blood cultures. TTP &gt; 69.4 h is likely to indicate contamination and may be useful to exclude true bacteremia in cases with one set of positive blood cultures. Meanwhile, diagnosing true bacteremia using the threshold of TTP 25.0 h would be difficult. Therefore, the clinical and bacteriological data are important for diagnosing bacteremia, especially in cases with TTP ≤ 69.4 h."
https://openalex.org/W4311284749,"Astrocytic excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) plays a major role in removing the excitatory neurotransmitter L-glutamate (L-Glu) from synaptic clefts in the forebrain to prevent excitotoxicity. Polyunsaturated fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 n-3) enhance synaptic transmission, and their target molecules include EAATs. Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of DHA on EAAT2 and identify the key amino acid for DHA/EAAT2 interaction by electrophysiological recording of L-Glu-induced current in Xenopus oocytes transfected with EAATs, their chimeras, and single mutants. DHA transiently increased the amplitude of EAAT2 but tended to decrease that of excitatory amino acid transporter subtype 1 (EAAT1), another astrocytic EAAT. Single mutation of leucine (Leu) 434 to alanine (Ala) completely suppressed the augmentation by DHA, while mutation of EAAT1 Ala 435 (corresponding to EAAT2 Leu434) to Leu changed the effect from suppression to augmentation. Other polyunsaturated fatty acids (docosapentaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, arachidonic acid, and α-linolenic acid) similarly augmented the EAAT2 current and suppressed the EAAT1 current. Finally, our docking analysis suggested the most stable docking site is the lipid crevice of EAAT2, in close proximity to the L-Glu and sodium binding sites, suggesting that the DHA/Leu434 interaction might affect the elevator-like slide and/or the shapes of the other binding sites. Collectively, our results highlight a key molecular detail in the DHA-induced regulation of synaptic transmission involving EAATs."
https://openalex.org/W4311314398,"When lifting an object sequentially with the two hands, information about object weight can be transferred from one hand to the other. This information can be used to predictively scale fingertip forces and to form a perceptual estimation about the object's weight. This study investigated how weight information can be transferred between the two hands and how this depends on the used hand and handedness of the participant. Right- and left-handed participants lifted light and heavy objects with the right or left hand in a pseudorandomized order and estimated the object's weight. Results showed that predictive force scaling depended on the previously lifted object, with higher force rates if a previous object was heavy. This known effect of sensorimotor memory was mostly independent of the used hand and handedness, indicating that weight information could be transferred across hands for fingertip force scaling. Furthermore, a perceptual bias that depended on the previous lifted object was found, with lower weight estimations when the previous object was heavy compared to light. While this bias was found for both light and heavy objects in right-handers, it was only observed for light objects in left-handers. Notably, in contrast to the results on force scaling, this effect was not transferred across hands. These findings indicate that the transfer of weight information depends differently on the used hand and handedness for perceptual estimations and predictive force scaling."

Rigorous and systematic program evaluation can help ensure that postgraduate training programs are achieving the program’s intended outcomes. The purpose of this project was to develop evidence-based evaluation tools that could be shared across federally funded biomedical training programs to enhance program evaluation capacity. This manuscript describes the evidence-based process used to determine program evaluation needs of these programs at a research-intensive university. Using a multi-phased sequential exploratory mixed methods approach, data were collected from trainees, employers, leaders, and program directors. Data analyses included document analysis of program plans, inductive coding of focus groups and interviews, and descriptive analysis of surveys. Two overarching categories–Trainee Skills and Program Characteristics—were identified including six themes each. Program directors prioritized communication, social and behavioral skills, and collaboration as the trainee skills that they needed the most help evaluating. Furthermore, program directors prioritized the following program characteristics as those that they needed the most help evaluating: training environment, trainee outcomes, and opportunities offered. Surveys, interview scripts, and related resources for the categories and themes were developed and curated on a publicly available website for program directors to use in their program evaluations."

Physical, psychosocial, and social conditions of work in rural environments contribute to women's domestic work experiences (DWEs) and the risk of MSP. The impact of DWEs on women's health is especially severe in water-insecure countries like Nigeria. This study examines the relationship between a recently developed measure of DWEs and self-reported pain in the lower back (LBP), neck/shoulder (NSP), and elbow/hand/wrist regions (EHWP) among rural Nigerian women.Interviewer-administered survey data were collected from 356 women in four rural communities of Ibadan, Nigeria. Binary and ordinal logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between DWE factor scores, sociodemographic characteristics, and musculoskeletal pain symptoms and severity after controlling for sociodemographic covariates. Effect estimates of association were presented using the odds ratio (OR), and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) at p-value of 0.05.Among 356 participants, the 2-month prevalence of LBP was 58%, NSP was 30%, and EWHP 30%. High DWE scores were significantly associated with higher odds of experiencing and having more severe LBP, NSP, and EHWP. Specifically, the odds of LBP [(OR = 2.88; 95% CI = 1.64-5.11), NSP (OR = 4.58; 95% CI = 2.29-9.40) and EHWP (OR = 1.88; 95% CI = 1.26-3.77)] were significantly higher among women who perceived their domestic work responsibilities as very stressful (i.e., 'high stress appraisal') compared to those with lower stress appraisal scores. Those who were time-pressured and had less autonomy over familial duties (i.e., 'high demand/low control') had significantly higher odds of LBP [(OR = 2.58; 95% CI = 1.64-4.09) and NSP (OR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.24-2.58)]. Frequently fetching and carrying water over long distances and time (i.e., 'high water sourcing and carriage') was also associated with higher odds of LBP [(OR = 1.31; 95% CI = 1.09-1.79) and NSP (OR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.08-1.76).Strenuous and stressful DWEs were associated with MSP among rural Nigerian women. This study provides new evidence on how the physical, social, and psychosocial factors of domestic work can increase women's risk of MSP."
https://openalex.org/W4311328151,"Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a major global cause of neonatal death and lifelong disability. Large animal translational studies of hypoxic ischemic brain injury, such as those conducted in fetal sheep, have and continue to play a key role in furthering our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of injury and developing new treatment strategies for clinical translation. At present, the quantification of neurons in histological images consists of slow, manually intensive morphological assessment, requiring many repeats by an expert, which can prove to be time-consuming and prone to human error. Hence, there is an urgent need to automate the neuron classification and quantification process. In this article, we present a ’Gradient Direction, Grey level Co-occurrence Matrix’ (GD-GLCM) image training method which outperforms and simplifies the standard training methodology using texture analysis to cell-classification. This is achieved by determining the Grey level Co-occurrence Matrix of the gradient direction of a cell image followed by direct passing to a classifier in the form of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Hence, avoiding all texture feature computation steps. The proposed MLP is trained on both healthy and dying neurons that are manually identified by an expert and validated on unseen hypoxic-ischemic brain slice images from the fetal sheep in utero model. We compared the performance of our classifier using the gradient magnitude dataset as well as the gradient direction dataset. We also compare the performance of a perceptron, a 1-layer MLP, and a 2-layer MLP to each other. We demonstrate here a way of accurately identifying both healthy and dying cortical neurons obtained from brain slice images of the fetal sheep model under global hypoxia to high precision by identifying the most minimised MLP architecture, minimised input space (GLCM size) and minimised training data (GLCM representations) to achieve the highest performance over the standard methodology."
https://openalex.org/W4311328154,"Tinnitus is a complex and not yet fully understood phenomenon. Often the treatments provided are effective only for subgroups of sufferers. We are presently not able to predict benefit with the currently available diagnostic tools and analysis methods. Being able to identify and specifically treat sub-categories of tinnitus would help develop and implement more targeted treatments with higher success rate. In this study we use a clustering analysis based on 17 predictors to cluster an audiologically homogeneous group of normal hearing participants, both with and without tinnitus. The predictors have been chosen to be either tinnitus-specific measures or measures that are thought to be connected to cochlear synaptopathy. Our aim was to identify a subgroup of participants with characteristics consistent with the current hypothesized impact of cochlear synaptopathy. Our results show that this approach can separate the listeners into different clusters. But not in all cases could the tinnitus sufferers be separated from the control group. Another challenge is the use of categorical measures which seem to dominate the importance analysis of the factors. The study showed that data-driven clustering of a homogeneous listener group based on a mixed set of experimental outcome measures is a promising tool for tinnitus sub-typing, with the caveat that sample sizes might need to be sufficiently high, and higher than in the present study, to keep a meaningful sample size after clustering."

However, this is threatened by the emergence of insecticide resistance. This study aimed to update the spatial distribution, the insecticide resistance profile of A. aegypti and A. albopictus and the potential resistant mechanisms implicated in the city of Douala. Immature stages of Aedes were collected in August 2020 in eight neighbourhoods in Douala and reared to adult stages. Adult bioassays, and piperonyl butoxide (PBO) synergist assays were carried out according to World Health Organization recommendations. Expression of some candidate metabolic genes including Cyp9M6F88/87, Cyp9J28a, Cyp9J10 and Cyp9J32 in A. aegypti, and Cyp6P12 in A. albopictus were assessed using qPCR. A. aegypti adults G0 were screened using real time melting curve qPCR analyses to genotype the F1534C, V1016I and V410L Aedes kdr mutations. Overall, A. aegypti is the predominant Aedes species, but analyses revealed that both A. albopictus and A. aegypti coexist in all the prospected neighbourhoods of Douala. High level of resistance was observed to three pyrethroids tested in both Aedes species. In A. aegypti a lower mortality rate was reported to permethrin (5.83%) and a higher mortality rate to deltamethrin (63.74%). Meanwhile, for A. albopictus, lower (6.72%) and higher (84.11%) mortality rates were reported to deltamethrin. Similar analysis with bendiocarb, revealed for A. aegypti a loss of susceptibility. However, in A. albopictus samples, analyses revealed a susceptibility in Logbessou, and confirmed resistance in Kotto (59.78%). A partial recovery of mortality was found to insecticides after pre-exposure to PBO. Cyp6P12 was found significantly overexpressed in A. albopictus permethrin resistant and Cyp9M6F88/87 for A. aegypti deltamethrin resistant. F1534C, V1016I and V410L mutations were detected in A. aegypti from different neighbourhoods and by considering the combination of these three kdr 14 genotypes were found. These findings provide relevant information which should be capitalised in the implementation of arbovirus vector control strategies and insecticide resistance management."
