https://openalex.org/W1509665269,"In nuclear transgenic plants, expression of multiple genes requires introduction of individual genes and time-consuming subsequent backcrosses to reconstitute multi-subunit proteins or pathways, a problem that is compounded by variable expression levels. In order to accomplish expression of multiple genes in a single transformation event, we have introduced several genes into the chromoplast genome. We confirmed stable integration of the cry2Aa2 operon by PCR and Southern blot analyses in T(0) and T(1) transgenic plants. Foreign protein accumulated at 45.3% of the total soluble protein in mature leaves and remained stable even in old bleached leaves (46.1%), thereby increasing the efficacy and safety of transgenic plants throughout the growing season. This represents the highest level of foreign gene expression reported in transgenic plants to date. Insects that are normally difficult to control (10-day old cotton bollworm, beet armyworm) were killed 100% after consuming transgenic leaves. Electron micrographs showed the presence of the insecticidal protein folded into cuboidal crystals. Formation of crystals of foreign proteins (due to hyperexpression and folding by the putative chaperonin, ORF 2) provides a simple method of purification by centrifugation and enhances stability by protection from cellular proteases. Demonstration of expression of an operon in transgenic plants paves the way to engineering new pathways in plants in a single transformation event."

Cell wall polymers of fungi are classically divided into two groups depending on their solubility in hot alkali. We have analyzed the alkali-insoluble fraction of the Aspergillus fumigatus cell wall, which is the fraction believed to be responsible for fungal cell wall rigidity. Using enzymatic digestions with recombinant endo-β-1,3-glucanase and chitinase, fractionation by gel filtration, affinity chromatography with immobilized lectins, and high performance liquid chromatography, several fractions that contained specific interpolysaccharide covalent linkages were isolated. Unique features of the A. fumigatuscell wall are (i) the absence of β-1,6-glucan and (ii) the presence of a linear β-1,3/1,4-glucan, never previously described in fungi. Galactomannan, chitin, and β-1,3-glucan were also found in the alkali-insoluble fraction. The β-1,3-glucan is a branched polymer with 4% of β-1,6 branch points. Chitin, galactomannan, and the linear β-1,3/1,4-glucan were covalently linked to the nonreducing end of β-1,3-glucan side chains. As in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, chitin was linked via a β-1,4 linkage to β-1,3-glucan. The data obtained suggested that the branching of β-1,3-glucan is an early event in the construction of the cell wall, resulting in an increase of potential acceptor sites for chitin, galactomannan, and the linear β-1,3/1,4-glucan.

Despite its central role in growth and survival, the fungal cell wall remains poorly studied and its biosynthesis is insufficiently understood (1Cabib E. Roberts R. Bowers B. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 763-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 2Fleet G.H. Rose A.H. Harrisson J.S. The Yeast. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, N. Y.1991: 199-277Google Scholar). Cell wall polysaccharides are separated in two groups according to their solubility in hot alkali solution. The structural skeleton of the cell wall is alkali-insoluble. It has been known for a long time that β-1,3-glucan and chitin (linear polymer of β-1,4-N-acetylglucosamine) are the main components of the alkali-insoluble fraction. The alkali insolubility of glucan is due to its covalent linkage with chitin (3Sietsma J.H. Wessels J.G.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 114: 99-108Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 4Mol P.C.

Yeast. 1994; 10: 1591-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The covalent bond between the two polysaccharides has been characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by Kollar et al. (6Kollar R. Petrakova E. Ashwell G. Robbins P.W. Cabib E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1170-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), who showed that chitin is linked to the nonreducing end of a β-1,3-glucan chain. More recently, the same research group reported that the core of the yeast cell wall is a complex structure with a β-1,6- and β-1,3-glucan to which chitin and some mannoproteins are attached (7Kollar R. Reinhold B.B. Petrakova E. Yeh H.J.C. Ashwell G. Drgonova J. Kapteyn J.C. Klis F.M. Cabib E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17762-17775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In yeast, cell wall-bound glycoproteins have been described to be covalently linked to β-1,6-glucan (8Montijn R.C. van Rinsum J. van Schagen F.A. Klis F.M. J. Biol.

These proteins are originally GPI-anchored to the membrane (11Lu C.F. Montijn R.C. Brown J.L. Klis F.M. Kurjan J. Bussey H. Lipke P.N. J.

Yeh H.J.C. Ashwell G. Drgonova J. Kapteyn J.C. Klis F.M. Cabib E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17762-17775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 13Kapteyn J.C. Montijn R.C.

Ethanolamine and mannose residues, but not glucosamine and inositol, are in the GPI remnant involved in the protein-glucan linkage (14Fujii T. Shimoi H. Iimura Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1427: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Another family of cell wall proteins are directly bound to β-1,3-glucan and released by mild alkali treatments (15Msra V. Seidl T. Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1145-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In contrast to yeast, the polymer organization of the cell wall of filamentous fungi has been poorly studied. Basically, it is only known that the alkali insolubility of their cell wall results, like in yeast, from the covalent association between glucan and chitin, with a concentration of chitin (around 10%) that is considerably higher than in yeast (2%) (16Aronson J. Cole G.T. Kendrick B. Biology of Conidial Fungi. Academic Press, N. Y.1981: 459-507Crossref Google Scholar). To better understand the organization of the cell wall components of a filamentous fungus and to gain further insight into the biosynthetic pathways involved in cell wall construction, we have focused our studies toward the chemical characterization of the interpolymer linkages occurring in the structural part of the cell wall,i.e. alkali-insoluble fraction of cell wall. The fungal model used is Aspergillus fumigatus. Using specific enzymatic digestion and various carbohydrate chemistry methods, we have shown that four polysaccharide components constituted this fraction: β-1,3-glucan was highly branched and was linked to chitin, galactomannan, and a linear β-1,3/1,4-glucan never described before. A. fumigatus CBS 144–89 was grown in a 15-liter fermenter in a liquid medium containing a 2% glucose and 1% mycopeptone (Biokar Diagnostics) as described previously (17Latgé J.P. Kobayashi H. Debeaupuis J.P. Diaquin M. Sarfati J. Wieruszeski J.M. Parra E. Bouchara J.P. Fournet B. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5424-5433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 24 h of culture (linear growth phase), the mycelia were collected by filtration, washed extensively with water and disrupted in a 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 buffer containing 50 mmEDTA and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in a Dyno-mill (W. A. Bachofen AG, Basel, Switzerland) cell homogenizer in the presence of 1-mm-diameter glass beads at 4 °C. The disrupted mycelial suspension was centrifuged (8000 × g for 10 min), and the cell wall pellet was washed three times with the same buffer and stored at −20 °C. Fractionation and digestion steps of the cell wall are summarized in Fig. 1. The disrupted cell wall pellet (50 g of wet weight, equivalent to 7.5 g of dried material) was incubated twice in 200 ml of 1 m NaOH at 65 °C for 30 min. A third NaOH treatment did not release any extra material from the pellet. The alkali-insoluble pellet was washed five times with water and once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 buffer. The pellet was resuspended in the same buffer supplemented with 5 mm sodium azide (60 ml) and incubated with 180 μl of Quantazyme (50 units/μl, recombinant endo-β-1,3-glucanase; Quantum Industry, Quebec, Canada) at 37 °C for 5 days. Endoglucanase digestion was repeated once. Pooled supernatants (QzSN) were kept frozen. After Quantazyme digestion, the insoluble pellet was treated twice with 1 m NaOH at 65 °C for 30 min both to inactivate Quantazyme and to extract material that had become alkali-soluble after the glucanase treatment (accounting for 8% of the total alkali-insoluble starting material). After washing with water, the insoluble pellet residue was resuspended in 80 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 containing 5 mm sodium azide and incubated at 37 °C for 5 days with 4 ml of recombinant chitinase A (0.5 mg of protein/ml) from Serratia marcescensproduced in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (18Vorgias C.E. Tews I. Perrakis A. Wilson K.J. Oppenheim A.B. Muzzarelli R.A.A. Chitin Enzymology. Eur. Chitin Soc., Ancona, Italy1993: 417-422Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the residual pellet was treated again with 1.2 ml of chitinase A in 40 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 3 days. After centrifugation, supernatants (ChSN) were pooled. The Quantazyme-chitinase resistant pellet was treated with sodium hydroxide in the same conditions as described above releasing an alkali-soluble fraction, which accounted for 2% of the total alkali-insoluble starting material. The final pellet (FP)1 was extensively washed with water before freeze drying. QzSN, ChSN, and FP were the three fractions analyzed. After concentration under vacuum, the QzSN and ChSN fractions were fractionated by gel filtration on a TSK HW40S column (90 × 1.4 cm, ToyoPearl) eluted with 0.25% (v/v) acetic acid at 0.5 ml/min. The products were detected by refractometry. The excluded fractions, eluting at the void volume of the TSK HW40S column, were run on a Sephadex G100 column (90 × 1.4 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) eluted with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, at 9 ml/h. Polysaccharide sizes were estimated based on dextran standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All fractions were desalted by gel filtration on a Sephadex G15 column (35 × 2.5 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) eluted with 20 mm acetic acid at 2 ml/min and freeze dried. Analysis of oligosaccharides was performed by HPAEC with a pulsed electrochemical detector and an anion exchange column (Carbo PAC PA-1, 4.6 × 250 mm, Dionex) using the following gradient at a flow rate of 1 ml/min: 0–2-min isocratic step with a mixture containing 98% of solution A (NaOH 50 mm) and 2% of solution B (NaOAc, 500 mm in NaOH 50 mm), 2–15 min of linear gradient (98% A + 2% B − 60% A + 40% B), 15–35 min of linear gradient (60% A + 40% B − 25% A + 75% B), and 35–37 min of linear gradient (25% A + 75% B − 100% B). The column was stabilized 20 min before injection. Purification of oligosaccharides was performed with a preparative column (Carbo PAC PA-1, 9 × 250 mm, Dionex) at a flow rate of 4 ml/min and the following gradient: 0–2-min isocratic step with a mixture containing 90% of solution A and 10% solution B, 2–5 min of linear gradient (90% A + 10% B − 68% A + 32% B), 5–36 min of linear gradient (68% A + 32% B − 61% A + 39% B), 36–37 min of linear gradient (61% A + 39% B − 100% B). The column was stabilized 20 min before injection. To avoid degradation by peeling, occurring during chromatography in 50 mm alkali solution, laminarioligosaccharides were reduced with NaBH4 (10 mg/ml in 100 mm NH4OH) overnight and desalted over a Sephadex G15 column. Total hexoses were quantified by the phenol-sulfuric acid procedure using glucose as standard (19Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (37431) Google Scholar). Total hexosamines were quantified by the Johnson procedure using glucosamine as standard (20Johnson A.R. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Monosaccharides were analyzed by GLC as trimethylsilylated methyl glycosides obtained after methanolysis (0.5 m HCl in dried methanol, 24 h, 80 °C), N-reacetylation and trimethylsilylation (21Kamerling J.P. Gerwig G.J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Clamp J.R. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and/or as alditol acetates obtained after hydrolysis (4 n trifluoroacetic acid, 100 °C, 4 h), reduction, and peracetylation (22Sawardeker J.S. Sloneker J.H. Jeanes A. Anal. Chem. 1967; 37: 1602-1604Crossref Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). Derivatized monosaccharides were separated and quantified on a DB5 capillary column (25 m × 0.32 mm, SGE) using a Delsi 200 apparatus (carrier gas, 0.7 bar helium; temperature program, 120–180 °C at 2 °C/min and 180–240 °C at 4 °C/min). Fractions were methylated using the lithium methyl sulfinyl carbanion procedure (23Paz Parente J. Cardon P. Leroy Y. Montreuil J. Fournet B. Ricart G. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 141: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) modified by Fontaine et al. (24Fontaine T. Talmont F. Dutton G.G.S. Fournet B. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Methyl ethers were either obtained (i) after hydrolysis (4n trifluoroacetic acid, 4 h, 100 °C) and analyzed as polyol acetates by GLC-MS (25Björndal H. Hellerqvist C.G. Lindberg B. Svensson S. Angew. Chem. Int. Edit. 1970; 9: 610-619Crossref Scopus (696) Google Scholar) or (ii) after methanolysis (0.5m HCl in dried methanol, 24 h, 80 °C) and analyzed as partially methylated methyl glycosides by GLC-MS (26Fournet B. Strecker G. Leroy Y. Montreuil J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Release of galactofuranoside residues from galactomannan was obtained by mild acid hydrolysis with 15 mm HCl at 100 °C for 20 h (17Latgé J.P. Kobayashi H. Debeaupuis J.P. Diaquin M. Sarfati J. Wieruszeski J.M. Parra E. Bouchara J.P. Fournet B. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5424-5433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Periodate oxidation was performed after incubation of 10 mg of material in 2 ml of sodiummeta-periodate, 100 mm, during 7 days at 4 °C in the dark (27Goldstein I.J. Hay G.W. Lewis B.A. Smith F. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 361-370Google Scholar). Excess of reagent was destroyed following addition of 200 μl of ethylene glycol. After dialysis against water (membrane cut-off, 1000 Da) or gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G15 column as described above, the oxidized product was reduced for 2 h in 100 mm ammonium hydroxide (2 ml) containing 20 mg of NaBH4. Excess of reagent was destroyed by addition of Dowex 50 × 8 (H+ form) resin beads until a pH of 5–6 was reached. After co-distillations with methanol, Smith degradation was performed with 10% acetic acid at 100 °C for 1 h. Degraded products were then separated by gel filtration chromatography on a TSK HW40S column as described above. Acetolysis of soluble polymers was performed according to Ferguson (28Ferguson M.A.J. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, U. K.1993: 349-383Google Scholar). Peracetylated products (40 mg) were treated with 10 ml of an acetic acid/acetic anhydride/sulfuric acid solution (10:10:1 v/v/v) at 25 or 37 °C for 3, 5, 7, and 24 h. The reaction was stopped by addition of 40 ml of pyridine and water (1:3 v/v). The peracetylated products were extracted with chloroform and washed with water. Deacetylation was performed in 300 mm NaOH and NaBH4 (10 mg/ml) overnight at room temperature. Hydrolysis with a 74-kDa endo-β-1,3-glucanase (ENG1) purified from an A. fumigatus cell wall autolysate was performed as described previously (29Fontaine T. Hartland R.P. Beauvais A. Diaquin M. Latgé J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly,1 mg of sample was digested in 500 μl of a 100 mm imidazole-acetic acid, pH 7.0 buffer with 10 μl of the 74-kDa endo-β-1,3-glucanase solution (specific activity, 1.5 μmol glucose equivalents/min/ml) at 37 °C for 24 h. To remove GlcNAc from the terminal nonreducing end of an oligosaccharide, 5 mg of sample were incubated with 5 μl of β-d-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Jack bean (10 units/160 μl, Sigma) in 250 μl of a 250 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0 buffer at 25 °C for 24 h. After addition of 50 μl of 1 m NaOH, oligosaccharides were treated with NaBD4 as described before. Transgalactosylation of terminal nonreducing GlcNAc residues was performed using the following procedure: samples containing 5 mg of carbohydrate were incubated in 600 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm MnCl2, and 5 mm sodium azide, with 120 μl of UDP-Gal (10 mg/200 μl) and 30 μl of galactosyl transferase (1 milliunit/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C during 3 days. A supplementary batch of 12 μl of enzyme and 20 μl of UDP-Gal was added to the sample, which was incubated for another 3 days at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by passing through two ion exchange columns (3 ml, Dowex 1 × 2 acetate form, Dowex 50 × 2, H+ form). The eluted products were desalted by gel filtration on a HW40S column as described above. Fractions containing 10 mg of carbohydrate were applied to a column of Concanavalin A-Sepharose (4 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mmMnCl2. After washing with the same buffer, bound products were eluted with 200 mm α-methyl-mannoside in the Tris buffer. Removal of salts from collected fractions (500 μl volume) were performed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G15 column as described above. Transgalactosylated samples were applied to a column of Erythrina cristagalli lectin-agarose (4 ml, Vector) equilibrated in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm KCl, and 2 mm MgCl2. After washing with the same buffer, bound products were eluted with 200 mm lactose in the HEPES buffer (7Kollar R. Reinhold B.B. Petrakova E. Yeh H.J.C. Ashwell G. Drgonova J. Kapteyn J.C. Klis F.M. Cabib E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17762-17775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Fractions of 500-μl volume were collected and desalted by gel filtration on a TSK HW40S column as described above. Samples were deuterium exchanged by freeze drying solution in D2O and then dissolved in 99.95% D2O (Solvants Documentation Synthèse, Peypin, France). The polysaccharide concentrations were approximately 3, 40, and 15 mg/ml for QzSN II, QzSN IB, and ChSN II, respectively. All NMR spectra were collected between 31 and 40 °C on a Varian Unity spectrometer operating at a proton frequency of 500 MHz and a13C frequency of 125 MHz and equipped with a z-gradient triple resonance (1H, 15N, 13C) probe. The temperature was chosen for each sample to avoid superposition of the HOD signal with anomeric protons signals. Spectra were collected at 31, 40, and 35 °C for QzSN II (fractions c, d, e, and f), QzSN IB, and ChSN II, respectively. Spectra were referenced to external trimethylsilyl-3 propionic acid-d 4 2,2,3,3-sodium salt. The NMR signals were assigned by 1H homonuclear experiments (DQF-COSY (30Rance M. Sorensen O.W.

Res. 1997; 302: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)). This last experiment gave all the 13C resonances of the same residue from the anomeric proton. Linkage assignments were made using two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments with mixing time of 400 ms for QzSN II (35Macura S. Huang Y. Suter D. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1981; 43: 259-281Google Scholar), off-resonance rotating frame two-dimensional nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy with a mixing time of 200 ms (36Desvaux, H., Berthault, P., Bilirakis, N., and Goldman, M.

Chem. 1993; 31: 287-292Crossref Scopus (936) Google Scholar). All two-dimensional data, except for RELAYH and gHMBC, were collected in the phase sensitive mode using the States-Haberkorn method (37States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar). Coupling constants were measured from one-dimensional spectrum recorded with a digital resolution of 0.30 Hz/point or from the DQF-COSY experiment with a digital resolution of 0.75 Hz/point after a zero filling. Matrix-assisted desorption ionization/time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Mass spectra were measured on a reflectron-type Vision 2000 time of flight mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany). Samples were mounted on a x, y movable stage allowing irradiation of selected sample areas. A nitrogen laser with an emission wavelength of 337 nm and 3-ns pulse duration was used. The spectrum was recorded in the positive ion mode and accelerated to an energy of 10 keV before entering the flight tube. Ions were post-accelerated for detection to an energy of 10 keV. Samples were prepared by mixing directly on the target 1 μl of oligosaccharide solution (about 25 pmol) and 1 μl of 2.5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix solution (12 mg/ml dissolved in CH3OH/H2O (80:20 v/v)). GLC-MS analysis were recorded using a Automass II 30 quadripolar mass spectrometer interfaced with a Carlo Erba 8000 Top gas chromatograph (Finnigan, Argenteuil, France). Electron ionization spectra were recorded using an ionization energy of 70 eV. Positive chemical ionization spectra were obtained at 70 eV using ammonia as reagent gas. Gas chromatograph was equipped with a CP-Sil 5CB/MS capillary column (25 m × 0.32 mm, Chrompack) gas vector, and helium was at the flow rate of 2 ml/min; the column temperature was 100–240 °C at 5 °C/min. NaOH treatment of 7.5 g of cell wall dried material (equivalent to 50 g of wet weight) resulted in the production of 3 g of alkali-insoluble fraction (40% of the wall dry weight). Treatment of this fraction by sequential incubation with recombinant β-1,3-glucanase (Quantazyme) and chitinase, alternated with alkali treatment, made soluble 90% of the alkali-insoluble starting material. (Fig. 1 and Table I). Further purification of the soluble fractions by gel filtration chromatography on TSK-HW40S and Sephadex G100 columns resulted in the separation of nine fractions of different molecular mass (Figs. 2 and3). The amounts of material of each fraction, expressed as percentages of original dry weight, and their sugar compositions are shown in Table I. Three out of the four fractions released by Quantazyme contained only glucose, whereas the high molecular weight fraction (QZSN IA) contained glucose associated with galactose and mannose. In a similar way, low molecular weight fractions ChSN III and ChSN IV released by chitinase were exclusively composed of GlcNAc, whereas fractions ChSN IA, ChSN IB, and ChSN II contained GlcNAc associated with various amounts of glucose, galactose, and mannose. The chemical analysis of the different fractions resulted in the identification of the chemical linkages occurring between the different polysaccharides of the alkali insoluble fraction.Table IMonosaccharide composition of the fractions obtained by NaOH and enzymatic treatments of the alkali-insoluble fraction of A. fumigatus cell wallFraction% (weight)Monosaccharide molar ratioManGlcGalGlcNAcGalNAcQzSN IA16.41.111.4QzSN IB18.71QzSN II4.81Qz SN III12.31ChSN IA5.70.910.90.01ChSN IB6.20.0310.040.02ChSN II0.60.0210.040.06ChSN III0.21ChSN IV14.21QzAS8.30.510.60.150.05ChAS1.80.3410.360.060.12FP110.3610.391.352.7 Open table in a new tab Figure 3Gel filtration chromatography on a Sephadex G100 column of the QzSN I and ChSN I fractions, which eluted at the void volume of the TSK HW40S column (Fig. 2).

Products (50 mg) were applied to the column and detected by refractometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) HPAEC, methylation, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis showed that QzSN III corresponded to laminaripentaose, which is the product of hydrolysis of β-1,3-glucan by Quantazyme (data not shown) QzSN II (1.5–2.5 kDa) contained a mixture of laminarioligosaccharides that had been reduced with NaBH4 before separation by HPAEC (Fig.4). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis indicated that the degree of polymerization (dp) of oligosaccharide varied from 9 to 15 (Fig. 4). Products with the same Mr gave two peaks on HPAEC analysis, suggesting they were chemically organized differently. Analysis of these oligosaccharides was performed by1H NMR spectroscopy on two couples of oligosaccharides with 10 and 11 glucose residues (QzSN IIc, QzSN IId, QzSNIIe, and QzSN IIf). The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of QzSN IId and QzSN IIf oligosaccharides were similar to a linear β-1,3-glucan with a glucitol residue at the reducing end as described previously (Ref. 38Hartland R.P.

The one-dimensional spectrum of the QzSN IIe oligosaccharide contained five doublets and two close-lying doublets in the anomeric region between 4.5 and 4.8 ppm (TableII). These chemical shifts and the coupling constants 3 J 1,2 of these doublets were in good agreement with those published for a linear β-1,3-glucan containing a β-1,6 linkage (39Yu L. Goldman R. Sullivan P. Walker G.F. Fesik S.W. J. Biomol. NMR. 1993; 3: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 40Mouyna I. Hartland R.P. Fontaine T. Diaquin M. Simenel C. Delepierre M. Henrissat B. Latgé J.-P. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3171-3180Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Each signal corresponded to one anomeric proton, except for the signals at 4.76 and 4.80 ppm, which accounted for two and four protons, respectively. The two close-lying doublets corresponding to one proton were due to different populations of conformers. Because glucitol did not give any signal in this part of the spectrum, the NMR results indicated the presence of 11 glucose units/QZSNIIe molecule, in agreement with the MALDI-TOF data. Because of severe overlap of other proton resonances, even in the DQF-COSY experiment, RELAYH experiments were performed to identify H3 resonances for further sequential assignment and linkage determination. From the chemical shifts reported in Table II, it can be seen that four units (labeled F) are undistinguishable by their proton resonances, as expected for a linear β-1,3-glucan chain. Chemical shifts of H3 protons are comprised between 3.75 and 3.80 ppm, except for the two C units with H3 resonances at 3.53 ppm, typical value for β-Glc unsubstituted in C3 corresponding to nonreducing end units.

The human homolog of the bovine orphan receptor PPR1 shares significant similarity to chemokine receptors. Transfection of this receptor into murine L1.2 cells resulted in responsiveness to monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-4, MCP-2, and MCP-1 in chemotaxis assays. Binding studies with radiolabeled MCP-4 demonstrated a single high affinity binding site with an IC50 of 0.14 nm. As shown by competition binding, other members of the MCP family also recognized this receptor. MCP-2 was the next most potent ligand, with an IC50 of 0.45 nm. Surprisingly, eotaxin (IC50 = 6.7 nm) and MCP-3 (IC50 = 4.1 nm) bind with greater affinity than MCP-1 (IC50 = 10.7 nm) but only act as agonists in chemotaxis assays at 100-fold higher concentrations. Because of high affinity binding and functional chemotactic responses, we have termed this receptor CCR11. The gene for CCR11 was localized to human chromosome 3q22, which is distinct from most CC chemokine receptor genes at 3p21. Northern blot hybridization was used to identify CCR11 expression in heart, small intestine, and lung. Thus CCR11 shares functional similarity to CCR2 because it recognizes members of the MCP family, but CCR11 has a distinct expression pattern.

The complexity and functions of the chemokine family, now with more than 30 genes, have become increasingly diverse as more members have been identified and characterized. Chemokines play a critical role in the host response to infection because they are responsible for recruitment of leukocyte subsets to sites of pathogen entry (7.Gerard C. Nature. 1998; 395: 217-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8.Baggiolini M. Nature. 1998; 392: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2385) Google Scholar). Many inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma (9.Wells T.N. Proudfoot A.E. Inflamm. Res. 1999; 48: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), have been associated with elevated chemokine expression. In addition, chemokines are also responsible for the migration of cells within certain lymphoid organs that are critical for leukocyte development, such as thymus (10.Suzuki G. Sawa H. Kobayashi Y.

Immunol. 1999; 11: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As shown by gene targeting studies, the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1 is critical for proper neuronal and cardiac development (16.Zou Y.R. Kottmann A.H. Kuroda M. Taniuchi I. Littman D.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar, 17.Nagasawa T. Hirota S. Tachibana K. Takakura N. Nishikawa S. Kitamura Y. Yoshida N. Kikutani H. Kishimoto T. Nature. 1996; 382: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar). Chemokines have also been implicated in cardiovascular processes such as angiogenesis and atherosclerosis (18.Gosling J. Slaymaker S. Gu L. Tseng S. Zlot C.H. Young S.G. Rollins B.J. Charo I.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar).Chemokines are recognized by specific seven transmembrane-spanning, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 (for review, see Refs. 19.Premack B.A. Schall T.J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar and 20.Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). Previously characterized chemokine receptors share significant homology, with 25–65% identical amino acids, and consequently form their own branch of the GPCR family tree. Many chemokine receptors were originally identified as orphan GPCRs. There remain several orphan GPCRs with high similarity to the chemokine receptor family.The orphan receptor PPR1 was originally isolated from bovine papillary tissue in a search for gustatory receptors (21.Matsuoka I. Mori T. Aoki J. Sato T. Kurihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the expression of PPR1 appears to be higher in lung than in tongue. In addition, PPR1 shares more similarity to chemokine receptors than gustatory or olfactory receptors. Because of this similarity, we isolated a human homolog of PPR1 and examined its ability to function as a chemokine receptor. The human homolog binds members of the MCP family (MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, and eotaxin) with high affinity and also mediates responses to MCP-4, MCP-2, and MCP-1 in chemotaxis assays. In accordance with the Chemokine Nomenclature Committee, we have designated this receptor CCR11.DISCUSSIONCCR11 was identified during a search of the human EST data base for homologs of the bovine orphan PPR1. When the full coding region of CCR11 was assembled, it was found to be 86% identical to PPR1 at the amino acid level. Homology comparisons indicated that CCR11 is most closely related to chemokine receptors. Its closest relatives are CCR7 (36% identical), CCR6 (33%), and CCR9 (33%). Chromosomal mapping of CCR11 localized it to 3q22. Interestingly, many other CC chemokine receptors also map to chromosome 3, including CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, and CCR8 (26.Samson M. Soularue P. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Genomics. 1996; 36: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). CCR11, however, is significantly separated from these receptors, which are clustered at 3p21–24. This suggests that CCR11 is more distantly related to most CC chemokine receptors, consistent with the sequence homology comparisons presented in Fig. 2. The CCR11 gene maps somewhat closer to the orphan receptor GPR15 (27; also known as BOB, 28) which is located at 3q11.2–13.1 (27.Heiber M. Marchese A. Nguyen T. Heng H.H. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Genomics. 1996; 32: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).As demonstrated in binding and chemotaxis studies, CCR11 is a chemokine receptor that recognizes ligands in the MCP family. The primary ligands for CCR11 are MCP-4 and MCP-2, based on binding affinities and agonist properties in chemotaxis experiments. Other MCP family members also interact with CCR11 with lower affinities. Although CCR11 is most closely related to CCR7, it does not interact with the CCR7 ligands ELC and SLC.The MCPs share high homology with each other (56–72%) and form their own branch of the CC chemokine family tree. In addition, the MCPs share some functional similarity and are all closely linked on human chromosome 17q11.2 (29.Nomiyama H. Fukuda S. Iio M. Tanase S. Miura R. Yoshie O. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, MCP expression patterns are distinct, with MCP-4 being expressed constitutively in lung, small intestine, and colon (30.Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Combadiere C. Rothenberg M.E. Sarafi M.N.

The characterization of MCP family members as ligands for CCR11 adds additional complexity and redundancy to this diverse repertoire of chemokine functions.Identification of ligands for orphan GPCRs can be complex. GPCRs can exhibit paradoxical behavior, particularly transfected recombinant receptors. Although not well understood, such unusual behavior may be caused by inappropriate G protein usage, overexpression of recombinant receptors, or other as yet unidentified phenomena. Our laboratory has noted that some chemokine receptors may not be expressed in a stable manner and that functional responses can be lost if not selected for repeatedly. 2C. J. Raport and P. W. Gray, unpublished observations.Overexpression is a natural consequence of using a strong promoter and may lead to functional responses that are potentially deleterious to transfected cells. Some changes we have observed with GPCR transfectants are increases in cell adhesiveness or decrease in growth rate. 3V. L. Schweickart, B. Steiner, and P. W. Gray, unpublished observations. With CCR11 our transfected cell population was initially selected by chemotaxis. When these cells were cloned, the majority had lost their responsiveness to MCP-4, but some clones responded even more vigorously than the original selected population. Thus, chemotactic selection greatly aided our identification and characterization of CCR11.Compared with other characterized chemokine receptors, we observed only weak calcium mobilization in response to MCP-4 stimulation. Perhaps CCR11 signal transduction is linked to G proteins that are not well complemented in L1.2 cells. Perhaps this receptor does not naturally induce a strong calcium response, like some other GPCRs. Alternatively, CCR11 calcium responses in L1.2 cells may be linked to cellular toxicity. Finally, CCR11 may recognize other, as yet unidentified, ligands that cause more significant calcium flux. Nevertheless, MCP-4 is a major ligand for CCR11 as shown by its strong binding affinity and potent agonist activity in chemotaxis experiments.As shown by Northern blot analysis, CCR11 has an unusual pattern of expression for a chemokine receptor. Because it is not highly expressed in lymphoid organs such as thymus or spleen, CCR11 is not likely to be involved in lymphocyte development as are CCR4, CCR7, and CCR9 (Refs.10.Suzuki G. Sawa H.

Immunol. 1999; 11: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, CCR11 is virtually undetectable in peripheral blood, being primarily expressed in the heart, small intestine, and lung. With the exception of CXCR4, which is broadly expressed in many tissues, chemokine receptors are typically expressed exclusively on cells of lymphoid or myeloid origin. Our inability to detect transcript in these cells may indicate that CCR11 is expressed on a subpopulation of lymphoid cells that are rare in whole blood but resident in specific tissues. CCR3, for example, is expressed only on eosinophils and a subset of Th2 cells and is undetectable by Northern blot in peripheral blood (39.Ponath P.D. Qin S. Post T.W. Wang J. Wu L. Gerard N.P. Newman W. Gerard C. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2437-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 40.Sallusto F. Mackay C.R. Lanzavecchia A. Science. 1997; 277: 2005-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Alternatively, CCR11 may be expressed on parenchymal cells and play a role currently unappreciated for chemokine receptors. Although chemokines and chemokine receptors are generally known for their role in immune cell development and trafficking, there is preliminary evidence that they may have functions outside of the immune system. Knockout experiments have shown that CXCR4 is essential for normal development of the heart, small intestine and brain (16.Zou Y.R. Kottmann A.H. Kuroda M. Taniuchi I. Littman D.R.

Cell. 1999; 99: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) have recently proposed that the virally encoded chemokine receptor US28 may play a role in the migration of smooth muscle cells seen in cytomegalovirus exacerbation of vascular disease (43.Streblow D.N.

MCP-1 and CCR2 have previously been associated with atherogenesis and are thought to play a role in recruitment of macrophages to initiate atherosclerotic plaque formation (18.Gosling J. Slaymaker S.

Vascular expression of MCP family members results in CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment and macrophage development; this may be accompanied by CCR11-mediated events. Perhaps CCR2 and CCR11 complement each other in vascular processes such as remodeling of the vessel wall to accommodate monocyte influx. The complex redundancy of MCP chemokines and their receptors in the vasculature may help to explain the results of transgenic and gene knockout studies (18.Gosling J. Slaymaker S. Gu L. Tseng S.

These gene alterations are not lethal and often do not have severe complications on their own, suggesting a compensatory role of genes with similar function. Further studies with CCR11 and its ligands will be required to understand fully their roles in health and disease. Chemokines are a family of small proteins, usually 70–90 amino acids in length, that are responsible for the directed migration of specific cell types (for reviews, see Refs. 1.Baggiolini M.

The complexity and functions of the chemokine family, now with more than 30 genes, have become increasingly diverse as more members have been identified and characterized. Chemokines play a critical role in the host response to infection because they are responsible for recruitment of leukocyte subsets to sites of pathogen entry (7.Gerard C. Nature. 1998; 395: 217-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8.Baggiolini M. Nature. 1998; 392: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2385) Google Scholar). Many inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma (9.Wells T.N. Proudfoot A.E. Inflamm. Res. 1999; 48: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), have been associated with elevated chemokine expression. In addition, chemokines are also responsible for the migration of cells within certain lymphoid organs that are critical for leukocyte development, such as thymus (10.Suzuki G. Sawa H. Kobayashi Y.

Immunol. 1999; 11: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As shown by gene targeting studies, the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1 is critical for proper neuronal and cardiac development (16.Zou Y.R. Kottmann A.H. Kuroda M. Taniuchi I. Littman D.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar, 17.Nagasawa T. Hirota S. Tachibana K. Takakura N. Nishikawa S. Kitamura Y. Yoshida N. Kikutani H. Kishimoto T. Nature. 1996; 382: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar). Chemokines have also been implicated in cardiovascular processes such as angiogenesis and atherosclerosis (18.Gosling J. Slaymaker S. Gu L. Tseng S. Zlot C.H. Young S.G. Rollins B.J. Charo I.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Chemokines are recognized by specific seven transmembrane-spanning, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 (for review, see Refs. 19.Premack B.A. Schall T.J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar and 20.Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). Previously characterized chemokine receptors share significant homology, with 25–65% identical amino acids, and consequently form their own branch of the GPCR family tree. Many chemokine receptors were originally identified as orphan GPCRs. There remain several orphan GPCRs with high similarity to the chemokine receptor family. The orphan receptor PPR1 was originally isolated from bovine papillary tissue in a search for gustatory receptors (21.Matsuoka I. Mori T. Aoki J. Sato T. Kurihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the expression of PPR1 appears to be higher in lung than in tongue. In addition, PPR1 shares more similarity to chemokine receptors than gustatory or olfactory receptors. Because of this similarity, we isolated a human homolog of PPR1 and examined its ability to function as a chemokine receptor. The human homolog binds members of the MCP family (MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, and eotaxin) with high affinity and also mediates responses to MCP-4, MCP-2, and MCP-1 in chemotaxis assays. In accordance with the Chemokine Nomenclature Committee, we have designated this receptor CCR11. DISCUSSIONCCR11 was identified during a search of the human EST data base for homologs of the bovine orphan PPR1. When the full coding region of CCR11 was assembled, it was found to be 86% identical to PPR1 at the amino acid level. Homology comparisons indicated that CCR11 is most closely related to chemokine receptors. Its closest relatives are CCR7 (36% identical), CCR6 (33%), and CCR9 (33%). Chromosomal mapping of CCR11 localized it to 3q22. Interestingly, many other CC chemokine receptors also map to chromosome 3, including CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, and CCR8 (26.Samson M. Soularue P. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Genomics. 1996; 36: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). CCR11, however, is significantly separated from these receptors, which are clustered at 3p21–24. This suggests that CCR11 is more distantly related to most CC chemokine receptors, consistent with the sequence homology comparisons presented in Fig. 2. The CCR11 gene maps somewhat closer to the orphan receptor GPR15 (27; also known as BOB, 28) which is located at 3q11.2–13.1 (27.Heiber M. Marchese A. Nguyen T. Heng H.H. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Genomics. 1996; 32: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).As demonstrated in binding and chemotaxis studies, CCR11 is a chemokine receptor that recognizes ligands in the MCP family. The primary ligands for CCR11 are MCP-4 and MCP-2, based on binding affinities and agonist properties in chemotaxis experiments. Other MCP family members also interact with CCR11 with lower affinities. Although CCR11 is most closely related to CCR7, it does not interact with the CCR7 ligands ELC and SLC.The MCPs share high homology with each other (56–72%) and form their own branch of the CC chemokine family tree. In addition, the MCPs share some functional similarity and are all closely linked on human chromosome 17q11.2 (29.Nomiyama H. Fukuda S. Iio M. Tanase S. Miura R. Yoshie O. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, MCP expression patterns are distinct, with MCP-4 being expressed constitutively in lung, small intestine, and colon (30.Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Combadiere C. Rothenberg M.E. Sarafi M.N.

The characterization of MCP family members as ligands for CCR11 adds additional complexity and redundancy to this diverse repertoire of chemokine functions.Identification of ligands for orphan GPCRs can be complex. GPCRs can exhibit paradoxical behavior, particularly transfected recombinant receptors. Although not well understood, such unusual behavior may be caused by inappropriate G protein usage, overexpression of recombinant receptors, or other as yet unidentified phenomena. Our laboratory has noted that some chemokine receptors may not be expressed in a stable manner and that functional responses can be lost if not selected for repeatedly. 2C. J. Raport and P. W. Gray, unpublished observations.Overexpression is a natural consequence of using a strong promoter and may lead to functional responses that are potentially deleterious to transfected cells. Some changes we have observed with GPCR transfectants are increases in cell adhesiveness or decrease in growth rate. 3V. L. Schweickart, B. Steiner, and P. W. Gray, unpublished observations. With CCR11 our transfected cell population was initially selected by chemotaxis. When these cells were cloned, the majority had lost their responsiveness to MCP-4, but some clones responded even more vigorously than the original selected population. Thus, chemotactic selection greatly aided our identification and characterization of CCR11.Compared with other characterized chemokine receptors, we observed only weak calcium mobilization in response to MCP-4 stimulation. Perhaps CCR11 signal transduction is linked to G proteins that are not well complemented in L1.2 cells. Perhaps this receptor does not naturally induce a strong calcium response, like some other GPCRs. Alternatively, CCR11 calcium responses in L1.2 cells may be linked to cellular toxicity. Finally, CCR11 may recognize other, as yet unidentified, ligands that cause more significant calcium flux. Nevertheless, MCP-4 is a major ligand for CCR11 as shown by its strong binding affinity and potent agonist activity in chemotaxis experiments.As shown by Northern blot analysis, CCR11 has an unusual pattern of expression for a chemokine receptor. Because it is not highly expressed in lymphoid organs such as thymus or spleen, CCR11 is not likely to be involved in lymphocyte development as are CCR4, CCR7, and CCR9 (Refs.10.Suzuki G. Sawa H.

Immunol. 1999; 11: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, CCR11 is virtually undetectable in peripheral blood, being primarily expressed in the heart, small intestine, and lung. With the exception of CXCR4, which is broadly expressed in many tissues, chemokine receptors are typically expressed exclusively on cells of lymphoid or myeloid origin. Our inability to detect transcript in these cells may indicate that CCR11 is expressed on a subpopulation of lymphoid cells that are rare in whole blood but resident in specific tissues. CCR3, for example, is expressed only on eosinophils and a subset of Th2 cells and is undetectable by Northern blot in peripheral blood (39.Ponath P.D. Qin S. Post T.W. Wang J. Wu L. Gerard N.P. Newman W. Gerard C. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2437-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 40.Sallusto F. Mackay C.R. Lanzavecchia A. Science. 1997; 277: 2005-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Alternatively, CCR11 may be expressed on parenchymal cells and play a role currently unappreciated for chemokine receptors. Although chemokines and chemokine receptors are generally known for their role in immune cell development and trafficking, there is preliminary evidence that they may have functions outside of the immune system. Knockout experiments have shown that CXCR4 is essential for normal development of the heart, small intestine and brain (16.Zou Y.R. Kottmann A.H. Kuroda M. Taniuchi I. Littman D.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar, 41.Tachibana K. Hirota S. Iizasa H. Yoshida H. Kawabata K. Kataoka Y. Kitamura Y. Matsushima K. Yoshida N. Nishikawa S. Kishimoto T. Nagasawa T. Nature. 1998; 393: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). In addition, Streblow et al. (43.Streblow D.N. Soderberg-Naucler C. Vieira J. Smith P. Wakabayashi E. Ruchti F. Mattison K. Altschuler Y. Nelson J.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) have recently proposed that the virally encoded chemokine receptor US28 may play a role in the migration of smooth muscle cells seen in cytomegalovirus exacerbation of vascular disease (43.Streblow D.N.

Cell. 1999; 99: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar).Based on its expression pattern, CCR11 may function in cells that are resident in highly vascularized tissues. MCP-1 and CCR2 have previously been associated with atherogenesis and are thought to play a role in recruitment of macrophages to initiate atherosclerotic plaque formation (18.Gosling J. Slaymaker S. Gu L. Tseng S. Zlot C.H. Young S.G. Rollins B.J. Charo I.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 44.Boring L. Gosling J. Cleary M. Charo I.F. Nature. 1998; 394: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1668) Google Scholar). Vascular expression of MCP family members results in CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment and macrophage development; this may be accompanied by CCR11-mediated events. Perhaps CCR2 and CCR11 complement each other in vascular processes such as remodeling of the vessel wall to accommodate monocyte influx. The complex redundancy of MCP chemokines and their receptors in the vasculature may help to explain the results of transgenic and gene knockout studies (18.Gosling J. Slaymaker S. Gu L. Tseng S.

Because it is not highly expressed in lymphoid organs such as thymus or spleen, CCR11 is not likely to be involved in lymphocyte development as are CCR4, CCR7, and CCR9 (Refs.10.Suzuki G. Sawa H.

Immunol. 1999; 11: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, CCR11 is virtually undetectable in peripheral blood, being primarily expressed in the heart, small intestine, and lung. With the exception of CXCR4, which is broadly expressed in many tissues, chemokine receptors are typically expressed exclusively on cells of lymphoid or myeloid origin. Our inability to detect transcript in these cells may indicate that CCR11 is expressed on a subpopulation of lymphoid cells that are rare in whole blood but resident in specific tissues. CCR3, for example, is expressed only on eosinophils and a subset of Th2 cells and is undetectable by Northern blot in peripheral blood (39.Ponath P.D. Qin S. Post T.W. Wang J. Wu L. Gerard N.P.

Science. 1997; 277: 2005-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Alternatively, CCR11 may be expressed on parenchymal cells and play a role currently unappreciated for chemokine receptors. Although chemokines and chemokine receptors are generally known for their role in immune cell development and trafficking, there is preliminary evidence that they may have functions outside of the immune system. Knockout experiments have shown that CXCR4 is essential for normal development of the heart, small intestine and brain (16.Zou Y.R. Kottmann A.H. Kuroda M. Taniuchi I. Littman D.R.

Based on its expression pattern, CCR11 may function in cells that are resident in highly vascularized tissues. MCP-1 and CCR2 have previously been associated with atherogenesis and are thought to play a role in recruitment of macrophages to initiate atherosclerotic plaque formation (18.Gosling J. Slaymaker S. Gu L. Tseng S. Zlot C.H. Young S.G. Rollins B.J. Charo I.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 44.Boring L. Gosling J. Cleary M. Charo I.F. Nature. 1998; 394: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1668) Google Scholar). Vascular expression of MCP family members results in CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment and macrophage development; this may be accompanied by CCR11-mediated events. Perhaps CCR2 and CCR11 complement each other in vascular processes such as remodeling of the vessel wall to accommodate monocyte influx. The complex redundancy of MCP chemokines and their receptors in the vasculature may help to explain the results of transgenic and gene knockout studies (18.Gosling J. Slaymaker S. Gu L. Tseng S.

These gene alterations are not lethal and often do not have severe complications on their own, suggesting a compensatory role of genes with similar function.

https://openalex.org/W2037411672,"WPK4 is a wheat protein kinase related to the yeast protein kinase SNF1, which plays a role in catabolite repression. To identify proteins involved in signal transduction through WPK4, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens and isolated two cDNA clones designated as TaWIN1 and TaWIN2. Both encode 14-3-3 proteins that, upon autophosphorylation, bind the C-terminal regulatory domain of WPK4. Mutational analysis through amino acid substitution revealed that TaWIN1 and TaWIN2 primarily bind WPK4 through phosphoserines at the positions 388 and 418, both located in the C-terminal region. Mutations in the conserved residues of the TaWIN1 amphipathic groove impaired the ability of TaWIN1 to bind to WPK4. A screen for in vitro phosphorylation of proteins involved in nutrient metabolism revealed a putative WPK4 substrate, nitrate reductase; its hinge 1 region was efficiently phosphorylated by WPK4. Subsequent far Western blots showed that it specifically bound TaWIN1. Since nitrate reductase has been shown to be inactivated by phosphorylation upon 14-3-3 binding, the present findings strongly suggest that WPK4 is the protein kinase responsible for controlling the nitrogen metabolic pathway, assembling the nitrate reductase and 14-3-3 complex through its phosphorylation specificity.

Full-Text PDF Open Access SNF1-related protein kinase glutathione S-transferase nickel nitrilotriacetic acid nitrate reductase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis AMP-activated protein kinase 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase Members of the SNF1-related protein kinases play a central role in phosphorylation cascades involved in carbon assimilation in animals, fungi, and plants (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the SNF1 complex is activated in response to glucose deprivation and inhibits the repression of many glucose-repressed genes, including genes involved in alternate carbon source utilization, respiration, and gluconeogenesis (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). In plants, more than 20 genes encoding the SNF1-related protein kinases (SnRKs)1 have been identified (2Halford N.G. Hardie D.G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 735-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Based on sequence similarity, they are classified into three distinct subgroups (SnRK1-SnRK3) of which SnRK1 has been the best characterized (2Halford N.G. Hardie D.G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 735-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). For example, SnRK1s from rye (RKIN1), tobacco (NPK5), and Arabidopsis thaliana (AKIN10, AKIN11) were shown to complement yeast snf1 mutant cells (2Halford N.G. Hardie D.G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 735-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Antisense expression of a potato SNF1 homolog resulted in a loss of sugar-inducible expression of sucrose synthase (3Purcel P. Smith A. Halford N. Plant J. 1998; 14: 195-202Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that members of the SnRK1 subgroup are SNF1 orthologs that activate sugar-inducible gene expression in sugar signaling pathways (2Halford N.G. Hardie D.G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 735-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). However, the physiological functions of the other two subgroups, SnRK2 and SnRK3, remain relatively poorly characterized. One method of determining the physiological role of SnRKs is to identify proteins that interact with them. For example, SNF1 and its mammalian homolog AMPK, a master switch that regulates carbohydrate and fat metabolism (4Bouly J.P. Gissot L. Lessard P. Kreis M. Thomas M. Plant J. 1999; 18: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), combine with other proteins to form a heterotrimer that includes both catalytic subunits, SNF1p and AMPK-α, respectively, and noncatalytic subunits including SIP1p (SIP2p, GAL83p, AMPK-β) and SNF4p (AMPK-γ) (4Bouly J.P. Gissot L. Lessard P. Kreis M. Thomas M. Plant J. 1999; 18: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the case of SnRKs, a recent survey using yeast two-hybrid system also revealed that the A. thaliana SnRK, AKINα1, interacted with noncatalytic subunits AKINβ1/β2 and AKINγ (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). AKIN10 and AKIN11 were also shown to form complexes with the protein PRL1 (5Bhalerao R.P. Salchert K. Bako L. Okresz L. Szabados L. Muranaka T. Machida Y. Schell J. Koncz C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5322-5327Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). CIPK, a member of the SnRK3 subgroup, was found to interact with an EF-hand-type calcium-binding protein similar to yeast calcineurin B (6Shi J. Kim K.N. Ritz O. Albrecht V. Gupta R. Harter K. Luan S. Kudla J. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2393-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). These observations clearly indicate that SnRKs function through specific interaction with signaling protein factors involved in nutrient metabolism. Previously we reported that WPK4, a gene encoding a wheat SnRK3, was up-regulated by light and cytokinins and down-regulated by nutrients (7Sano H. Youssefian S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2582-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Primary sequence analysis revealed that C-terminal region of WPK4 is more distantly related than other SnRK subgroups, which suggests that WPK4 may possess another function in nutrient signal transduction pathways (8Ikeda Y. Koizumi N. Kusano T. Sano H. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To identify target proteins that interact with WPK4, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify two cDNA clones. Both encode 14-3-3 proteins that bound WPK4-phosphorylated nitrate reductase. Yeast two-hybrid screening was conducted using a HybriZAP-2.1 two-hybrid vector system (Stratagene). The cDNA library was prepared from 7-day-old wheat seedlings grown in water and treated with 100 μm N 6-benzylaminopurine for 24 h using a ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene). A HybriZAP two-hybrid vector was used to construct a GAL4 activation domain fusion cDNA library (2 × 107 plaque-forming units) that was converted to a yeast plasmid library by in vivo excision. pBD-WPK4, in which WPK4 cDNA was inserted in-frame with a right orientation into a pBD-GAL4 Cam vector, was used as the bait plasmid. The yeast strain YRG2 (Stratagene), which carries pBD-WPK4, was subsequently transformed with the library plasmids. The K75D-WPK4 (8Ikeda Y. Koizumi N. Kusano T. Sano H. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) andΔC-WPK4 genes were cloned into a pBD-Gal4 Cam vector. A series of WPK4 mutants (T204A, T204E, S388A, S418A, and S388A/S418A) were constructed using the Mutan-ExpressK m kit (TAKARA) and appropriate oligonucleotides. For the S388/418A double mutant, the S338A mutation was generated on the S418A clone. A series of TaWIN1 mutants (K60D, R67E, L185D, V189E, G221S, and L233D) were similarly constructed. All mutagenized inserts were subcloned into the pAD Gal4 vector. The ΔN-WPK4 gene containing the 3′-distal 1-kilobase fragment of WPK4 with the double mutation S388A/S418A was cloned into a pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The entire coding regions of TaWIN1 and TaWIN2 were cloned in-frame into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), yielding pGEX-TaWIN1 and pGEX-TaWIN2, respectively. These were also cloned in-frame into pET32a (Novagen), yielding pET-TaWIN1 and pET-TaWIN2. A DNA fragment encoding a peptide corresponding to the residues 469–560 of tobacco Nia1 (nitrate reductase) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pGEX4-T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). pGEX-HMGR was prepared as described (8Ikeda Y. Koizumi N. Kusano T. Sano H. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) and its fusion derivatives were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α cells and purified as described (8Ikeda Y. Koizumi N. Kusano T. Sano H. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). His-tagged proteins were expressed in the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified by Ni-NTA superflow resin (Qiagen). Purified proteins were dialyzed and stored in 30% glycerol until use. GST-TaWIN1 fusion proteins were retained in a glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin. Beads were then incubated with T buffer containing 100 units of thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 24 h. TaWIN1, purified with a DEAE-Toyopearl column, was put through high resolution gel filtration chromatography and equilibrated with 2× phosphate-buffered saline. For GST pull-down assays, His-tagged TaWIN1 protein was dissolved in a protein binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 140 mm KCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Tween 20) to a final concentration of 0.05%. Glutathione-Sepharose beads bound to GST, GST-WPK4, or GST-K75D were incubated in a kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 20 mm MgCl2, and 20 μm ATP) at room temperature for 1 h and washed with the protein binding buffer. 20 μl of each sample of glutathione-Sepharose beads was added to 50 μl of the His-tagged TaWIN1 protein solution, then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Proteins were released from the resins by boiling in Laemmli's sample buffer and separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. His-TaWIN1 was detected using an anti-(His)5 monoclonal antibody (Novagen) and chemilluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A previously described protocol for far Western blotting was employed, with modifications (9Kinoshita T. Shimazaki K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5548-5558Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). GST, GST-HMGR, and GST-nitrate reductase (GST-NR) proteins (1 μg of each) were phosphorylated by GST-WPK4 in a kinase buffer at 30 °C for 30 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, denatured, and renatured with guanidine-HCl. Membranes were kept in a blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Tween 20) at room temperature for 1 h, then incubated with the 0.5% His-TaWIN1 fusion protein in the same buffer at room temperature for 1 h. Immunological detection was performed as described above. Screening 1 × 106 clones by the yeast two-hybrid system, isolated three clones that activated two reporter genes, HIS3 andlacZ. Sequence analysis revealed that two were derived from the same gene and were designated as TaWIN1( T riticum a estivum WPK4-interacting factor 1). The third showed a 70% similarity to TaWIN1 and was designated asTaWIN2. All three encoded 14-3-3 proteins (Fig.1 A). TaWIN1 encoded a polypeptide consisting of 266 amino acid residues with a relative molecular mass of 29.4 kDa. TaWIN1 showed the highest similarity to GF14d, isolated from rice (10Schultz T.F. Medina J. Hill A. Quatrano R.S. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 837-847PubMed Google Scholar). TaWIN2 encoded a polypeptide consisting of 259 amino acid residues with a relative molecular mass of 28.6 kDa. TaWIN2 belonged to the omega-type 14-3-3 proteins but is more distantly related (Fig. 1 C). A putative EF-hand motif is also found in both TaWIN1 and TaWIN2 between helices 8 and 9, with the conserved Gly critical for calcium binding (11Lu G. Sehnke P.C. Ferl R.J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B). A Thr residue, one of the autophosphorylation sites located in the activation loop, is well conserved in WPK4, SNF1, AMPK, and protein kinase A (Fig.2 A). Substitution with Ala (T204A) reduced interaction with TaWIN1 and TaWIN2 to 76 and 72% that of wild type, respectively (Fig. 2 B). By contrast, substitution with Glu (T204E) strengthened the interaction to 118 and 115%, respectively (Fig. 2 B). The mutant lacking phosphorylation activity (K75D) (8Ikeda Y. Koizumi N. Kusano T. Sano H. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) showed essentially no interaction with either TaWIN1 or TaWIN2 (Fig. 2 B). The results indicate the necessity of kinase activity for the binding of WPK4 to TaWIN1 and TaWIN2 as well as the crucial role of the Thr in the activation loop. A GST pull-down assay showed that TaWIN1 specifically binds GST-WPK4 but not GST-K75D in vitro, indicating a direct interaction between WPK4 and TaWIN1 Fig. 2 C). There are two potential 14-3-3 binding motifs, RPASLN (with S388) and RFISGEP (with S418) in the C-terminal region of WPK4. To determine whether these motifs are indeed binding sites, we constructed mutants in which one or both of the two Ser residues were replaced with Ala (Fig.3 A). A third mutant lacking the C-terminal region was also constructed (ΔC). A quantitative liquid assay showed that the ΔC mutation completely abolished the binding of WPK4 to TaWIN1 and TaWIN2, thereby demonstrating that the C-terminal region is critical for interaction (Fig. 3 B). Binding of the S388A mutant to TaWIN1 and TaWIN2 was reduced to 80 and 76% of the control, respectively; likewise, that of S418A reduced binding to 76 and 59%, respectively (Fig. 3 B). The S388A/S418A double mutant had even further reduced binding, with only 25% of the control (Fig. 3 B). These results show that the binding of TaWIN1 and TaWIN2 to WPK4 is primarily mediated by the phosphorylated Ser-388 and Ser-418 of WPK4. To determine whether these two Ser residues are sites of autophosphorylation, two N-terminal-truncated mutations (ΔN) containing only the 165-amino acid C-terminal region were constructed (Fig. 3 A) and subjected to phosphorylation by GST-WPK4 (Fig. 3 C). The results showed no clear difference between ΔN and Ser-388/418AΔN in phosphate receptor function, suggesting the presence of another phosphorylation site(s) in the C-terminal region. Far Western blotting analysis showed that phosphorylated Ser-388/418AΔN was able to bind TaWIN1, although the efficiency was low (Fig. 3 C). These results showed that, in addition to two Ser-containing regions described above, there is an additional binding site(s) for TaWIN1 in the C-terminal region of WPK4. In general, 14-3-3 proteins form dimers and their inner surfaces form amphipathic grooves that serve as the principle binding site for 14-3-3 ligands (12Liu D. Bienkowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H. Liddington R. Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to change the conserved basic and hydrophobic residues located in the inner surface of TaWIN1. Basic residues within helix 3 (Lys-60, Arg-67) and hydrophobic residues within helices 7 and 9 (Leu-185, Val-189, Leu-233) were substituted with acidic residues (K60D, R67E, L185D, V189E, L233D) (Fig.4 A). Binding assays showed all of these residues to be critical for interaction between TaWIN1 and WPK4 (Fig. 4 A). However, when the Gly in the putative EF-hand motif of TaWIN1 was substituted by Ser (G221S), no loss of binding activity was observed (Fig. 4 A). This suggests that, at least in yeast cells, calcium ions are not required for WPK4/TaWIN1 interaction. The capacity for TaWIN1-TaWIN2 dimer formation was then analyzed by a GST pull-down assay, which clearly showed that TaWIN1 was able to bind TaWIN2 (Fig. 4 B). This indicates that each are able to form heteromeric dimers. Purified recombinant TaWIN1 protein was subjected to gel filtration followed by SDS-PAGE, whereupon the relative molecular mass of each fraction after each step was estimated to be 64 and 32 kDa, respectively (Fig. 4 C). NR is inactivated by phosphorylation followed by 14-3-3 protein binding (13Bachmann M. Huber J.L. Liao P.-C. Gage D.A. Huber S.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A peptide from the hinge 1 region of tobacco NR was expressed as a GST fusion protein and subjected to a WPK4 phosphorylation assay (Fig. 5). The results showed that WPK4 phosphorylates GST-NR and GST-HMGR, but not GST (Fig. 5 B). TaWIN1 was subsequently examined by far Western blotting for binding phosphorylated NR. It is clear that TaWIN1 efficiently binds phosphorylated NR, but not HMGR in this system (Fig. 5 C). TaWIN1 was not found to bind unphosphorylated NR (Fig.5 C). The localization of TaWIN1 in wheat tissues was examined by RNA blot analysis. Although WPK4 transcripts were detected in upper-ground tissues, especially in leaves, those of TaWIN1were found in all tissues examined (Fig.6 A). The induction profiles of these transcripts were also examined. Although WPK4transcripts accumulated in response to cytokinins and nutrient deprivation (Fig. 6, B and C) (7Sano H. Youssefian S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2582-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), transcripts ofTaWIN1 were ubiquitously accumulated regardless of the presence or absence of these factors (Fig. 6, B andC). These results suggest that TaWIN1 is constitutively expressed without being affected by the external factors that regulate WPK4. The present paper provides evidence that TaWINs, different isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins, interact with WPK4, and that TaWIN1 directly binds WPK4-phosphorylated NR. Yeast two-hybrid screens were performed to find proteins that interact with WPK4, and distinct clones termed TaWINs were isolated. The primary sequence indicated that they belong to the 14-3-3 protein family. In general, 14-3-3 proteins bind ligands containing phosphorylated consensus motif RSXpSXP (pS is phosphoserine), found in Raf (14Fantl W.J. Muslin A.J. Kikuchi A. Martin J.A. MacNicol A.M. Gross R.W. Williams L.T. Nature. 1994; 371: 612-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), Bad (15Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J.

A. 1995; 92: 7892-7896Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), although unphosphorylated peptides have also been shown to be the target of 14-3-3 proteins (17Petosa C. Masters S.C. Bankston L.A. Pohl J. Wang B. Fu H. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16305-16310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Our finding that TaWINs bind only autophosphorylated WPK4 suggests that its C-terminal region is only a pseudosubstrate region; this was directly shown for the case of Ser-388 and Ser-418 autophosphorylation, which occurs in the C-terminal region. Plant 14-3-3 proteins are involved in many cellular events, including enzyme regulation, gene expression, and protein translocation (18Finnie C. Borch J. Collinge D.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Despite the diversity of these physiological functions, few reports have yet been presented on their interaction with protein kinases. One notable study found that they bind calcium-dependent protein kinase, resulting in enzymatic activation in vitro(19Camoni L. Harper J.F. Palmgren M.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). By contrast, the binding of TaWINs to WPK4 did not influence kinase activity under our experimental conditions. 2Y. Ikeda, N. Koizumi, T. Kusano, and H. Sano, unpublished observation. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that some protein kinases may generally interact with 14-3-3 proteins, which assist in the transduction of signals that the kinases receive. The activity of NR, the key enzyme in plant nitrogen assimilation pathways, is both transcriptionally and post-translationally regulated (20Kaiser W.M. Weiner H. Huber S.C. Physiol. Plant. 1999; 105: 385-390Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Post-translational regulation is performed by reversible phosphorylation with subsequent binding of inhibitor proteins (20Kaiser W.M. Weiner H. Huber S.C. Physiol. Plant. 1999; 105: 385-390Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 21Bachmann M. McMichael R.W. Huber J.L. Kaiser W.M. Huber S.C. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In previous studies, three protein kinases responsible for NR phosphorylation at Ser-543 were isolated from spinach leaves and designated PKI, PKII, and PKIII (22Douglas P. Pigaglio E. Ferrer A. Halford N.G. MacKintosh C. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). PKII was shown to be a calcium-dependent protein kinase, and PKIII was shown to be an SNF1-related kinase (23Douglas P. Morrice N. MacKintosh C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 377: 113-117Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). NR, which is reversibly phosphorylated at Ser-543, has been shown elsewhere to interact with 14-3-3 proteins, which results in its enzymatic inactivation (13Bachmann M. Huber J.L. Liao P.-C. Gage D.A. Huber S.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 20Kaiser W.M. Weiner H. Huber S.C. Physiol. Plant. 1999; 105: 385-390Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, mechanisms by which NR kinase is activated and by which 14-3-3 proteins are recruited remain to be determined. In the present study we suggest that one of the NR kinases is WKP4 and propose the following working hypothesis. Upon external stimulation, WPK4 autophosphorylates its regulatory domain, to which the 14-3-3 protein (TaWIN) binds. WPK4 simultaneously phosphorylates NR, to which TaWIN is transferred; this forms the enzymatically inactive NR/TaWIN complex (Fig.7). Since WPK4 is up-regulated by nutrient deprivation (8Ikeda Y. Koizumi N. Kusano T. Sano H. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), our model may partly explain the complex regulation of NR; the reduction of NR activity by reduced nutrient assimilation (24Crawford N.M. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) could conceivably be mediated through WPK4 system."

Low-molecular-weight molecules that bind to RNA have the potential to be used as drugs. Therefore, technologies facilitating the rapid and reliable identification of such activities become increasingly important. We have applied a fluorescence-based assay to screen for modulators of hammerhead ribozyme (HHR) catalysis from a small library of antibiotic compounds. Several unknown potent inhibitors of the hammerhead cleavage reaction were identified and further characterized. Tuberactinomycin A, for which positive cooperativity of inhibition in vitro was found, also reduced ribozyme cleavage in vivo. The assay is applicable to the screening of mixtures of compounds, as inhibitory activities were detected within a collection of 2,000 extracts from different actinomycete strains. This approach allows the rapid, reliable, and convenient identification and characterization of ribozyme modulators leading to insights difficult to obtain by classical methodology."
