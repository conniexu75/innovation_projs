Both types of cell undergo deprogramming to a proliferative stem cell state and become potentially immortal and invasive. To investigate the hypothesis that embryonic genes are re-expressed in cancer cells, we prepare amplified cDNA from human individual preimplantation embryos and isolate embryo-specific sequences. We show that three novel embryonic genes, and also the known gene, OCT4, are expressed in human tumours but not expressed in normal somatic tissues. Genes specific to this unique phase of the human life cycle and not expressed in somatic cells may have greater potential for targeting in cancer treatment."

The exact mechanism of the interaction of fatty acids and acidic phospholipids with cyt c is unknown. Binding of cytc to liposomes with high contents (mole fractionX > 0.7) of acidic phospholipids caused spectral changes identical to those due to binding of oleic acid. Fluorescence spectroscopy of a cyt c analog containing a Zn2+ substituted heme moiety and brominated lipid derivatives (9,10)-dibromostearate and 1-palmitoyl-2-(9,10)-dibromo-sn-glycero-3-phospho-rac-glycerol demonstrated a direct contact between the fluorescent [Zn2+-heme] group and the brominated acyl chain. These data constitute direct evidence for interaction between an acyl chain of a membrane phospholipid and the inside of the protein containing the heme moiety and provide direct evidence for the so-called extended-lipid anchorage of cyt c to phospholipid membranes. In this mechanism, one of the phospholipid acyl chains protrudes out of the membrane and intercalates into a hydrophobic channel in cyt c while the other chain remains in the bilayer.

With its heme moiety switching between ferro and ferri forms, this water-soluble 13-kDa protein shuttles electrons from cyt c reductase to cyt c oxidase. (1Moore G.R. Pettigrew G.W.

In addition to its role in mitochondrial respiration, a novel function has been discovered for cyt cin apoptosis (2Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X.

In the cytoplasm, cyt c forms a complex with a protein called Apaf-1 and caspase 9, the formation of this “apoptosome” complex leading to the activation of the cascade of proteases executing apoptosis in cells (5Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar). The apoptosis inducing form of cyt c has been suggested to be membrane-bound (6Jemmerson R. Liu J. Hausauer D. Lam K.P. Mondino A. Nelson R.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). An acidic phospholipid, cardiolipin, either by itself or complexed with cyt c oxidase, provides the membrane binding site for cyt c in mitochondria (7Vik S.B. Georgevich G. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 8Speck S.H. Neu C.A. Swanson M.S. Margoliash E. FEBS Lett. 1983; 164: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cyt c bears a net positive charge of +8 and binds avidly to model membranes containing acidic phospholipids (9Rytömaa M. Mustonen P. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22243-22248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, the interaction of cytc with acidic phospholipids involves more than electrostatic attraction. Two different types of interaction have been characterized for the membrane binding of cyt c and have been shown to be due to distinct sites, named the A-site and the C-site, respectively (10Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3197-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). More specifically, negative surface charge density of the liposomes, pH, and ionic strength together determine whether cytc is bound electrostatically via its A-site or by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction via its C-site (9Rytömaa M. Mustonen P. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22243-22248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3197-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The electrostatic A-site interaction can be reversed by ATP and does not involve pronounced changes in the protein conformation as revealed by circular dichroism measurements on native cyt c and fluorescence spectroscopy studies using a derivative of cytc, in which the heme iron has been substituted by zinc (11Tuominen E.K.J. Zhu K. Wallace C.J.A. Clark-Lewis I. Craig D.B. Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19356-19362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Studies of the C-site lipid-bound cyt c have demonstrated this type of interaction not to be reversed by ATP (10Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3197-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Conformational studies revealed C-site binding to membranes to involve significant changes in the Soret region CD-spectrum thus suggesting changes in the heme environment and thus perturbations in the interior of the protein (11Tuominen E.K.J. Zhu K. Wallace C.J.A. Clark-Lewis I. Craig D.B. Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19356-19362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). ATP is able to interact with the C-site membrane-bound cytc, leading to further changes in its conformation (11Tuominen E.K.J. Zhu K. Wallace C.J.A. Clark-Lewis I. Craig D.B. Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19356-19362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic component of C-site-mediated interaction of cytc with an acidic phospholipid has been suggested to be due to the so-called extended lipid anchorage (10Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3197-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 12Kinnunen P.K.J. Kõiv A. Lehtonen J.Y.A. Rytömaa M. Mustonen P. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 73: 181-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this mechanism one of the acyl chains of acidic phospholipid would be accommodated within a hydrophobic channel in cyt c, whereas the other chain of the glycerophospholipid remains in the lipid bilayer. In this study we provide further evidence for the extended lipid anchorage of cyt c binding to liposomes. The extended lipid anchorage has been proposed to represent a general mechanism for peripheral membrane protein-lipid interaction (12Kinnunen P.K.J. Kõiv A. Lehtonen J.Y.A. Rytömaa M. Mustonen P. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 73: 181-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 13Kinnunen P.K.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 81: 151-166Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Horse heart cyt c (type VI, oxidized form), POPG, POPC, and oleic acid were from Sigma Chemical Co. No impurities were detected in the above lipids upon thin layer chromatography on silicic acid using chloroform/methanol/water/ammonia (65:20:2:2, v/v) as the solvent system and examination of the plates for pyrene fluorescence or after iodine staining. All other reagents were of reagent grade from Sigma or Merck. Oleic acid and POPG were reacted with Br2 to produce 9,10-dibromostearic acid and the corresponding phospholipid derivate (14Dawidowicz E.A. Rothman J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 455: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, Br2reacts with the double bond of oleic acid moiety by addition. Lipids (approximately 1 μmol) were dissolved into 1 ml of octane, and 5% Br2 (w/v) in this solvent was added in 2-μl aliquots until the solution began accumulating the color of molecular bromine. Solutions were immediately stored in −20 °C for at least 24 h. Unreacted bromine was removed by evaporation under reduced pressure, and by chromatography on a silicic acid column eluted with CHCl3:MeOH (7:3, v/v). The purity of the products was verified by thin layer chromatography in chloroform/methanol/water/ammonia (65:20:2:2, v/v) where a single band was evident upon iodine staining. Required amounts of cyt cwere weighed and dissolved in 20 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. To obtain reduced cyt c, excess solid sodium dithionite was added to the solution. Subsequently, the protein solutions were eluted through a disposable gel column (Sephadex PD-10, Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) to remove the inorganic reaction products and excess of the reducing agent. The redox state was verified by recording the absorption spectrum, and concentrations were determined from reduced solutions using an extinction coefficient of 106.100 m−1 cm at 410 nm (15Margoliash E. Frohwirt N. Biochem. J. 1959; 71: 570-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Substitution of Zn2+ for Fe2+ in the porphyrin of cyt c yields an intensely fluorescent derivative (16Vanderkooi J.M. Adar F. Erecinska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 64: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This analog has been characterized in considerable detail and has been shown to closely resemble the parent protein in most qualities, thus representing a good model to study the conformation of cyt c (11Tuominen E.K.J. Zhu K. Wallace C.J.A. Clark-Lewis I. Craig D.B. Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19356-19362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Anni H. Vanderkooi J.M. Mayne L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5744-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The [Zn2+-heme] cyt c derivative was prepared from horse cyt c according to Vanderkooi and Erecinska (18Vanderkooi J.M. Erecinska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 60: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To obtain iron-free cyt c, porphyrin cyt c was first made and then subsequently treated with ZnCl2 to yield [Zn2+-heme] cyt c (16Vanderkooi J.M. Adar F. Erecinska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 64: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Lipids were dissolved in chloroform. After mixing to obtain the desired compositions, the solvent was removed under a stream of nitrogen and the lipid residue subsequently maintained under reduced pressure for at least 2 h. The dry lipids were then hydrated in 20 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0 or 4.0, at room temperature to yield a lipid concentration of 1 mm. To obtain unilamellar vesicles, the hydrated lipid dispersions were extruded with a LiposoFast pneumatic small volume homogenizer (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada). Samples were subjected to 19 passes through two polycarbonate filters (100-nm pore size, Nucleopore, Pleasanton, CA) installed in tandem (19MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.Ph. M. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the liposome solution was divided into proper aliquots and diluted with the buffer to desired final lipid concentration. Steady-state absorbance spectra were recorded on a Cary 100 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian, Walnut Creek, CA). Measurements were conducted in dual beam configuration at ambient temperature. Baseline was recorded for each experiment prior to the addition of the indicated amounts of cyt c into the measurement cuvette. Interactions of fatty acids and phospholipids with [Zn2+-heme] cyt c were assessed by fluorescence spectroscopy. These measurements were conducted with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorometer using 5- and 10-nm band passes for excitation at 412 nm and emission at 588 nm, respectively. Two milliliters of 0.7 μm[Zn2+-heme] cyt c in 20 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, were placed into a magnetically stirred four-window quartz cuvette in a holder thermostatted with a circulating water bath at 25 °C. Subsequently, the indicated lipids (fatty acid or liposomes) were added to yield the desired final concentrations and the fluorescence of the Zn2+-heme moiety was observed. Fatty acids were added in 1- to 5-μl aliquots in ethanol solution. Control experiments indicated no detectable changes in fluorescence intensities by this solvent (data not shown). Because of the low concentrations of both lipids and cyt c used minimal interference by the inner filter effect is expected. In keeping with a previous study (20Stewart J.M. Blakely J.A. Johnson M.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 675-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a change in the absorption spectrum of reduced cyt c was detected upon interaction with oleic acid (Fig. 1). In brief, the intensity of the Soret band at 415 nm decreased by approximately 30%, concomitant with a shift to a lower wavelength, from 415 to 407 nm. The double peak characteristic for reduced cyt c disappeared, and the resulting spectrum with the bound fatty acid thus resembles that for oxidized cyt c. The above change due to fatty acid binding to cyt c was interpreted to indicate a shift of the heme iron to a high spin state (20Stewart J.M. Blakely J.A. Johnson M.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 675-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spectral changes have recently been reported for cyt c interacting with cardiolipin-containing liposomes (21Nantes I.L. Zucchi M.R. Nascimento O.R. Faljoni-Alario A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 153-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and based on EPR and magnetic CD measurements these authors suggested also that these spectral alterations result from spin-state changes. To investigate if the changes in the spectra for cyt cresult from an interaction of the protein with phospholipid acyl chains we studied the binding of cyt c to large unilamellar phospholipid vesicles, LUVs. cyt c was equilibrated with LUVs consisting of different lipid compositions and at excess phospholipid concentration (1:100 cyt c:phospholipid stoichiometry). These conditions were selected on the basis of our earlier fluorescence studies (9Rytömaa M. Mustonen P. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22243-22248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tuominen E.K.J. Zhu K. Wallace C.J.A. Clark-Lewis I. Craig D.B. Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19356-19362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The absorption spectra of cytc were then recorded. To avoid difficulties in the interpretation of the data, PG was used instead of cardiolipin in these experiments, similarly to our earlier studies (9Rytömaa M. Mustonen P. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22243-22248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3197-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 11Tuominen E.K.J. Zhu K. Wallace C.J.A. Clark-Lewis I. Craig D.B. Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19356-19362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1770-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At low molar fractions (X PG < 0.5) of acidic phospholipid and neutral pH, cyt c interacts with membranes electrostatically via its so-called A-site (22Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1770-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the A-site binding does not cause detectable changes in the absorbance spectrum (Fig. 2). In contrast, with neat PG liposomes (X PG = 1.0), spectral changes similar to those induced by oleic acid were evident (Fig. 2). The extent of the spectral changes was dependent on the lipid composition. More specifically, with X PGincreasing from 0 to 0.5, no indications for an interaction between cytc and phospholipid acyl chains were seen. BetweenX PG = 0.5 and 0.6 an effect on the spectra became evident, with maximal change at X PGbetween 0.8 and 0.9. The dependence on X PG of the spectral change (Fig. 3) in reduced cyt c on X PG is identical to the switching from the A-site to C-site binding with increasing acidic phospholipid content (10Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3197-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This dependence onX PG is also reflected in the kinetics of association of cyt c with liposomes (23Subramanian M. Jutila A. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 394-402Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Binding to the C-site is attributed to the protonation of the acidic phospholipid headgroups in the membrane. More specifically, upon increasing headgroup protonation (i.e. decreasing degree of dissociation), cyt c's binding to liposomes shifts from an electrostatic interaction to a hydrophobicity-driven membrane association and has also been suggested to involve hydrogen bonding (10Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3197-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The C-site binding of cyt c cannot be reversed by anions such as ATP while this nucleotide readily dissociates A-site bound cyt c (10Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3197-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 22Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1770-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The above data strongly suggest that the C-site interaction with membrane phospholipids shares a common mechanism with the binding of fatty acids to cyt c. To investigate the fatty acid binding of cyt cin more detail, we employed a cyt c analog in which the heme iron is changed to Zn2+. The [Zn2+-heme] moiety is intrinsically fluorescent (18Vanderkooi J.M. Erecinska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 60: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and thus provides an excellent tool for monitoring changes occurring in the heme environment (11Tuominen E.K.J. Zhu K. Wallace C.J.A. Clark-Lewis I. Craig D.B. Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19356-19362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Bromine is a well known collisional quencher for fluorophores, its action necessitating a contact with the fluorophore. Accordingly, brominated lipids such as 9,10-dibromostearic acid and P(Br2)SPG can be used to investigate the binding of cytc to lipids, because possible direct interactions between the brominated acyl chain and the fluorescent [Zn2+-heme] moiety can be detected. To assess the extent of fluorescence quenching, we first measured changes caused by the corresponding non-brominated lipids. The addition of oleic acid induced pronounced and biphasic changes in the fluorescence of [Zn2+-heme] cyt c. More specifically, with increasing oleic acid concentrations up to 15 μm (corresponding to approximately 1:20 of cytc:fatty acid molar ratio) relative fluorescence intensity first decreased to approx. 80% of the initial value (Fig.4). However, increasing the oleic acid concentration further led to an increased RFI, to approximately 90% of its initial value. This effect saturated at 30 μm fatty acid. When the brominated derivative of oleic acid, 9,10-dibromostearic, acid was used, a significant quenching of the [Zn2+-heme] cyt c fluorescence was evident (Fig. 4) with RFI decreasing maximally by approximately 45% at 15–20 μm 9,10-dibromostearic acid (Fig. 4). Yet, also for 9,10-dibromostearic acid, the changes in fluorescence were biphasic, with a minor increase being evident upon increasing the concentration of the brominated fatty acid from approximately 25–30 μm. With neat POPG liposomes, the alterations in the [Zn2+-heme] cyt c fluorescence were similar to those induced by oleic acid. At low (5 μm) phospholipid concentrations an initial decrement in RFI of 20% was seen. Increasing phospholipid concentration further caused RFI to exceed the initial value, with the signal approaching its maximum at 30–40 μm phospholipid. In contrast, the brominated phospholipid P(Br2)SPG efficiently quenched the Zn2+-heme fluorescence, similarly to 9,10-dibromostearic acid. Emission intensity decreased with increasing phospholipid concentration up to 20 μm whereafter a slight increase in fluorescence was seen with further increase in [P(Br2)SPG] up to 40 μm (Fig. 5). Normalizing the fluorescence intensity relative to the emission intensity measured in the presence of POPG assesses the effect of collisional quenching by bromine. These data reveal pronounced quenching by P(Br2)SPG, which saturates at 20–30 μm phospholipid and correspondes to cyt c:PG molar ratio of 1:30–1:40 (Fig. 6). The efficient quenching by the brominated fatty acid moiety of the PG derivative provides direct evidence for its interaction with the [Zn2+-heme] moiety residing in the interior of cytc. Cyt c has been shown to bind free fatty acids (20Stewart J.M. Blakely J.A. Johnson M.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 675-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Nantes I.L. Zucchi M.R. Nascimento O.R.

Biophys. 1963; 100: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This interaction causes changes in the visual, NMR, CD, and MCD spectra, which indicate conformational changes in the protein, including disruption of the S-Fe coordination between Met-80 and the heme iron. The EPR spectra further indicated that the interaction of cyt c with lipids promoted a change of the heme iron spin state (21Nantes I.L. Zucchi M.R. Nascimento O.R. Faljoni-Alario A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 153-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Together, these findings reveal the binding of free fatty acids as well as acidic phospholipids to cyt c to directly affect the heme environment. Binding to acidic phospholipid-containing membranes results in significant changes in the Soret band CD spectrum of cyt c, along with alterations in the [Zn2+-heme] fluorescence lifetimes for the derivatized cyt c (11Tuominen E.K.J. Zhu K. Wallace C.J.A. Clark-Lewis I. Craig D.B. Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19356-19362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These observations demonstrating alterations in the heme environment only occur upon binding of cyt c to bilayers with high lipid contents of acidic phospholipid, with the mole fraction X for PG exceeding 0.5 (11Tuominen E.K.J. Zhu K. Wallace C.J.A. Clark-Lewis I. Craig D.B. Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19356-19362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Importantly, although the above studies demonstrate an effect by fatty acids and acidic phospholipids on the environment of the heme moiety of cytc, they do not distinguish between two possibilities: either direct contact between the heme and lipids or these alterations could originate from changes produced in the conformation of cytc. In this study we compared the effects in cyt c induced by the free fatty acids and acidic phospholipids. Our present data provide further evidence that these changes in the spectra of cyt cdepend on the content of the acidic phospholipids in the liposomes. This dependence is identical to that determining the binding of cytc to phospholipids via either its A- or C-site (10Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3197-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We have previously suggested that C-site binding involves the so-called extended lipid conformation (12Kinnunen P.K.J. Kõiv A. Lehtonen J.Y.A. Rytömaa M. Mustonen P. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 73: 181-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), with one of the acyl chains of a phospholipid molecule protruding out of the membrane, and accommodated into a hydrophobic channel in the protein (10Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3197-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 22Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1770-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this mechanism, the other acyl chain of the phospholipid resides in the membrane. This mechanism thus results in hydrophobic anchoring of cyt c on the membrane surface, without penetration into the bilayer. The first report on the structure of cyt c resolved by x-ray crystallography revealed a hydrophobic channel from the surface to the heme crevice (25Dickerson R.E. Takano T. Eisenberg D. Kallai O.B. Samson L. Cooper A. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1511-1535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter authors also suggested this channel to provide a putative binding site for a non-defined hydrophobic moiety. The opening of this channel is located at the surface of cytc between the side chains of Tyr-97 and Phe-10 (25Dickerson R.E. Takano T. Eisenberg D. Kallai O.B. Samson L. Cooper A. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1511-1535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This opening lined by hydrophobic amino acids is evident also in the crystal structures published later (26Bushnell G.W. Louie G.V. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). The experiments described here also demonstrate direct contact between brominated oleic acid as well as the brominated sn-2 acyl chain of P(Br2)SPG and the [Zn2+-heme] moiety of cyt c. The biphasic changes in the [Zn2+-heme] fluorescence, i.e. an initial decrement followed by a smooth yet significant increase, are of interest. It is possible that this behavior could reflect occupancy of the hydrophobic channel by acyl chains inserted into it from two different directions, the observed concentration differences being due to distinct and different binding affinities of the lipid headgroups and the binding sites on protein surface. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms(s) requires further studies. Importantly, in keeping with the earlier results by Stewart et al. (20Stewart J.M. Blakely J.A. Johnson M.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 675-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) these changes in the [Zn2+-heme] fluorescence are specific for lipids having a charged headgroup and zwitterionic detergents such as dodecylmaltoside and CHAPS were without effect. However, SDS produced changes similar to those due to oleic acid (data not shown). In retrospect the extended phospholipid anchorage also readily explains also the early observations on the interaction of cyt c with phospholipid monolayers (27Quinn P.J. Dawson R.M.C. Biochem. J. 1969; 113: 791-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Quinn P.J. Dawson R.M.C. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). More specifically, the latter authors concluded that two types of interaction could occur with cytc and phosphatidylethanolamine (27Quinn P.J. Dawson R.M.C. Biochem. J. 1969; 113: 791-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). At low surface pressures, cyt c penetrated into the monolayer, whereas at higher surface pressures no penetration was observed. Yet, a considerable amount of cyt c was adsorbed at the interface. Interestingly, the adsorption of cyt c to membranes at high surface pressures was found not to be a true equilibrium process and could be reversed by increasing salt concentrations or by perfusing the subphase with fresh buffer. In the experiments on cyt cinteracting with cardiolipin an unexpected behavior of the surface pressure and potential was observed, again leading to binding, which was irreversible by increasing salt concentrations (28Quinn P.J. Dawson R.M.C. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These authors concluded that the cyt c-cardiolipin complex undergoes a time-dependent conformational change caused by interaction with the fatty acid residues of the phospholipid. These effects comply with the extended anchorage involving phospholipid acyl chains. Pachence and Blasie (29Pachence J.M. Blasie J.K. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 894-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) observed the average electron density of the hydrocarbon chain methylene group region of the surface phospholipid layer to decrease upon the binding of cyt c to Langmuir-Blodgett type multilayers containing phosphatidylserine. At the same time the average distance of the terminal methyl group and the polar headgroup was increased, suggesting a conformational change in the monolayer phospholipids. Interestingly, the fatty acid moieties of cardiolipin in isolated mitochondrial membranes were found to be protected from double-bond hydrogenation catalyzed by a palladium complex (30Schlame M. Horvath L. Vigh L. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The presence of peripheral membrane proteins was found to be required for this selective protection of cardiolipins fatty acids, as compared with phosphatidylcholine fatty acids. The authors concluded that the hydrophobic moieties of the cardiolipin are critical requirements for the high protein affinity of this phospholipid (30Schlame M. Horvath L. Vigh L. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Extended lipid anchorage would readily explain these results, because a fatty acid moiety residing in a hydrophobic cavity in a protein would be sterically protected from the catalyst. As has already been pointed out (13Kinnunen P.K.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 81: 151-166Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar) the extended lipid anchorage could represent a generic mechanism. A common requirement for proteins in this category should be the presence of a free fatty acid binding site. To this end, Kahana et al. have suggested (31Kahana E. Pinder J.C. Smith K.S. Gratzer W.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that fatty acid binding is a general characteristic for peripheral membrane proteins. Regarding the structure of membrane phospholipids, the presence of a saturated acyl chain in the sn-1 and unsaturated acyl chain in the sn-2 positions is conspicuous (32Gennis R.B. Biomembranes: Molecular Structure and Function. Springer-Verlag, New York1989: 23-27Google Scholar). The adoption of the extended conformation only requires the rotation of the C2–C3 carbon bond of the phospholipid glycerol backbone (33Hauser H. Guyer W.G. Skrabal P.P. Sundell S. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 34Hauser H. Pascher I. Sundell S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 9166-9174Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it would be thesn-2 chain, which would protrude out of the lipid bilayer. Obviously, the cis double bond readily allows for greater conformational flexibility. The above considerations are in keeping with the quenching of Trp-187 of annexin V by phospholipids bearing a fluorescence quenching nitroxyl moiety linked to acyl chain in thesn-2 position, although this was not observed for thesn-1 nitroxyl acyl chain (35Meers P. Mealy T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5829-5837Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Likewise, long chain fatty acids in the sn-2 position had a greater effect on Trp fluorescence, when compared with shorter acyl chains. These authors concluded that specific hydrophobic interactions with thesn-2 acyl chain are a major determinant for the binding of annexin V to membranes (35Meers P. Mealy T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5829-5837Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Finally, the lipid binding properties of milk protein α-lactalbumin closely resemble those of cyt c(36Carwthern K.M. Permyakov E. Berliner L.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 4: 1394-1405Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, lipid binding to α-lactalbumin has been suggested to induce the molten globule state, similarly to cyt c (37Dolgikh D.A. Gilmanshin R.I. Brazhnikov E.V. Bychkova V.E. Semisotnov G.V. Venjaminov S.Y. Ptitsyn O.B. FEBS Lett. 1981; 136: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar,38Hamada D. Kidokoro A.-I. Fukada H. Takahashi K. Goto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10325-10329Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This is particularly intriguing when taking into account the role of cyt c in apoptosis (2Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar, 3Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T. Jones D.P. Wang X.

Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4241) Google Scholar) and the finding that it is the lipid-bound cyt c that is active in triggering the activation of caspases (6Jemmerson R. Liu J. Hausauer D. Lam K.P. Mondino A. Nelson R.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Analogously, α-lactalbumin with bound oleic acid has been recently reported to induce apoptosis in cancer cells (39Svensson M. Håkansson A. Mossberg A.-K. Svanborg C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4221-4226Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In the light of the above findings, a thorough understanding of lipid-protein interactions could shed light on a number of central cellular processes, including apoptosis."

These cytosolic proteins selectively bind to the agonist-activated and GPCR kinase-phosphorylated forms of the GPCR, precluding its further interaction with the G protein. Certain mutations in visual arrestin yield “constitutively active” proteins that bind with high affinity to the light-activated form of rhodopsin without requiring phosphorylation. The crystal structure of visual arrestin shows that these activating mutations perturb two groups of intramolecular interactions that keep arrestin in its basal (inactive) state. Here we introduced homologous mutations into arrestin2 and arrestin3 and found that the resulting mutants bind to the β2-adrenoreceptor in vitro in a phosphorylation-independent fashion. The same mutants effectively desensitize both the β2-adrenergic and δ-opioid receptors in the absence of receptor phosphorylation inXenopus oocytes. Moreover, the arrestin mutants also desensitize the truncated δ-opioid receptor from which the C terminus, containing critical phosphorylation sites, has been removed. Conservation of the phosphate-sensitive hot spots in non-visual arrestins suggests that the overall fold is similar to that of visual arrestin and that the mechanisms whereby receptor-attached phosphates drive arrestin transition into the active binding competent state are conserved throughout the arrestin family of proteins.

Signaling by various members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 is attenuated by a uniform two-step mechanism (1Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). First, the agonist-activated receptor that catalyzes GDP/GTP exchange on G proteins is specifically phosphorylated by a G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK). An arrestin protein then binds to the active phosphoreceptor, which makes further G protein interaction impossible by simple steric exclusion (2Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18125-18131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Because of the high affinity of non-visual arrestins 2Note that here we use the systematic names of non-visual arrestins.

The synonyms of arrestin2 are β-arrestin and β-arrestin1; arrestin3 is also called β-arrestin2. for various components of the trafficking machinery (3Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Holt J.A. Barak L.S.

Arrestin binding also serves to switch GPCR signaling from G proteins to various mitogen-activated protein kinases (6Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The loss of active receptor conformation in the endosomes (presumably due to ligand dissociation) facilitates arrestin dissociation, rendering the phosphoreceptor accessible to protein phosphatases. The dephosphorylated receptor can then be recycled back to the plasma membrane (9Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar).Perfectly timed binding and dissociation of arrestins, which are ensured by their remarkable selectivity for the phosphorylated/activated form of their cognate receptors, are equally important for high fidelity of this quenching mechanism. Destabilization of certain intramolecular interactions that support the basal (inactive) arrestin conformation by the activated phosphoreceptor is the mechanistic basis of arrestin selectivity (10Gurevich V.V.

The results presented in this study help to define the conserved mechanisms of arrestin activation.RESULTSTwo main groups of intramolecular interactions are largely responsible for the stability of the basal conformation of visual arrestin (14Gurevich V.V.

We hypothesized that these residues participate in the binding of arrestin to receptor-attached phosphates and function as phosphate sensors; phosphate binding neutralizes the charge on Arg, thereby breaking its interaction with its negatively charged partner (10Gurevich V.V.

Thus, if the charge is already neutralized or reversed by a mutation, arrestin would not require that the receptor be phosphorylated before it could bind to the agonist-activated receptor. In visual arrestin, alanine substitutions of bulky hydrophobic residues in either participant of the three-element interaction yield mutants with enhanced binding to activated unphosphorylated and phosphorylated inactive rhodopsin (but not to the inactive unphosphorylated form) (25Vishnivetskiy S.A.

The most potent of these is the triple alanine substitution in the C-tail of arrestin (F375A,V376A,F377A, referred to as 3A mutations) (14Gurevich V.V. J. Biol.

To test this idea, we introduced three types of mutations that yield robust phosphorylation-independent binding in visual arrestin (11Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 14Gurevich V.V. J. Biol.

First, we reversed the charge of the putative main phosphate sensor in arrestin3 by the R170E mutation. Second, we introduced triple alanine substitutions (I286A,V387A,F388A) in the C-tail of both arrestin2 and arrestin3. In addition, we introduced mutations in the distal part of the arrestin3 C-tail, neutralized the charge of Arg-393 (homolog of Arg-382 in visual arrestin), and deleted residues 394–409 or 393–409. (The difference between these two deletions is the absence or presence of Arg-393.)The mutants were expressed in tritiated form in a cell-free translation system and tested in a direct binding assay with a purified, reconstituted β2AR (16Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Arrestin2(3A) demonstrated the typical phenotype of a phosphorylation-independent mutant. WT arrestin2 binding to phosphorylated and isoproterenol-activated β2AR (P-β2AR*) was substantially greater than to the unphosphorylated form of the receptor (β2AR*). In contrast, the binding of the arrestin2 (3A) mutant to unphosphorylated β2AR* was high and was not significantly increased by receptor phosphorylation (Fig.2 A). Arrestin3 mutants demonstrate similar binding patterns (Fig. 2 A), supporting the idea that homologous mutations in all arrestins yield similar phenotypes. As predicted, arrestin3-(1–393), which does not have the distant C-tail but has all the key elements of both the polar core and the three-element interaction, shows essentially WT selectivity for P-β2AR*.Figure 2Binding characteristics of mutant arrestins. A, 100 fmol of unphosphorylated (β2AR*) or GRK2-phosphorylated (P-β2AR*) purified β2-adrenergic receptor reconstituted into liposomes was incubated in 50 μl with 50 fmol of the indicated tritiated arrestin (specific activities, 70–110 dpm/fmol) in the presence of 100 μm agonist isoproterenol as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, 0.3 μg of unphosphorylated (Rh*) or rhodopsin kinase-phosphorylated (P-Rh*) rhodopsin was incubated with the same amount of arrestins under room light. Membrane-bound arrestins were separated by gel filtration on Sepharose 2B and quantified in a liquid scintillation counter. *,p < 0.01; Student's t test, as compared with the binding of a corresponding WT protein to the same functional form of the same receptor. Mean ± S.E. from three experiments, each performed in duplicate, are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interestingly, the most potent phosphorylation-independent form of visual arrestin (Fig. 2 B), arrestin(3A), that binds with very high affinity to unphosphorylated, light-activated rhodopsin (Rh*) (Fig. 2 B), does not demonstrate enhanced binding to β2AR*, although its binding to P-β2AR* is about 50% higher than that of WT visual arrestin (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, constitutively active forms of both non-visual arrestins demonstrate higher binding to light-activated phosphorhodopsin (P-Rh*) than their parental WT proteins, but none of these mutants shows an enhanced binding to Rh* (Fig. 2 B). Thus, mutational destabilization of either of the two main intramolecular interactions that hold arrestin proteins in the basal state facilitates the binding of these proteins to the phosphorylated active form of a non-preferred receptor but is not sufficient to promote binding to its unphosphorylated active form. The constitutively active forms of arrestin2 and arrestin3 that bind equally well to the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of β2AR* still strongly prefer the phosphorylated form of rhodopsin.To further explore the mechanism underlying constitutive activity of the mutants, we also tested the binding of the most potent phosphorylation-independent forms (3A mutants) to the inactive forms of both receptors. In the case of β2AR, the latter were represented by both empty (P-β2AR and β2AR) and antagonist-occupied (in the presence of 10 μm alprenolol, P-β2ARA and β2ARA) forms (Fig.3 A), whereas in the case of rhodopsin a dark inactive receptor was used (P-Rh and Rh) (Fig.3 B). As we reported earlier (16Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), the binding of visual arrestin to any form of β2AR is low and appears to depend only on receptor phosphorylation (i.e. the binding to phosphorylated forms is higher than to unphosphorylated forms and it does not depend on receptor activation state). 3A mutation enhances the binding without changing this pattern. Both WT non-visual arrestins demonstrate relatively high binding to inactive forms of both phosphoreceptors. 3A mutations enhance their binding to all phosphorylated forms, further reducing their ability to discriminate between active and inactive phosphoreceptor (Fig. 3 A). However, the binding of these mutations to an unphosphorylated receptor is strictly activation-dependent; both 3A mutants bind to β2AR* with high affinity and do not demonstrate appreciable binding to β2AR or β2ARA (Fig. 3 A). In contrast to the strong preference for activated β2AR*, the binding of constitutively active non-visual arrestins to rhodopsin was not significantly enhanced by receptor activation (compare Rh and Rh* binding on Fig.3 B).Figure 3Comparison of activation and phosphorylation dependence of the binding of WT arrestins and 3A mutants. The binding to indicated functional forms of β2AR (A) and rhodopsin (B) was performed as described in the legend to Fig. 2. Note that the subscript A indicates an antagonist-occupied receptor (in the presence of 10 μm alprenolol), whereas * indicates an active receptor (agonist-occupied β2AR and light-activated rhodopsin). Means ± S.E. from two experiments, each performed in duplicate, are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next we compared the ability of these arrestins to promote desensitization of β2AR in Xenopus oocytes with and without simultaneous expression of GRK3. The major advantage of this system is that in sharp contrast to cultured cells oocytes do not express detectable amounts of arrestins or GRKs. As a result, the direct effects of mutant arrestins and GRKs on the rate of receptor desensitization in a living cell can be tested without any interference from endogenous proteins. Another major advantage is an easy readout; activation of a Gαi/o or Gαs protein by any GPCR can be monitored in real time via a potassium current through a βγ-gated inwardly rectifying channel (18Kovoor A. Celver J. Abdryashitov R.I. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6831-6834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 26Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27605-27611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4, the expression of WT arrestins does not accelerate the rate of β2AR desensitization, whereas the coexpression of GRK3 with either arrestin accelerates it 3–4-fold. In contrast, arrestin2(3A) and several arrestin3 mutants (3A, 1–392, R393Q, and R170E) dramatically accelerate β2AR inactivation even in the absence of GRK3. All phosphorylation-independent mutants fully retain the ability to inactivate GRK3-phosphorylated receptor. This is true even for arrestin3 (R170E) in which the charge of phosphate-binding Arg-170 is reversed, likely precluding direct interaction of this residue with the phosphate. Thus, high affinity arrestin binding to β2AR is possible when its interactions with phosphates is either precluded by their absence on the receptor or impeded by the absence of one of the key phosphate binding arrestin residues. These results suggest that the binding of non-visual arrestins to receptor-attached phosphates per se does not significantly contribute to the overall interaction. This conclusion agrees with the model of sequential multisite binding earlier proposed for visual arrestin-rhodopsin interaction (13Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, this is the mechanistic reason why it is possible to construct functionally effective phosphorylation-independent arrestins.Figure 4GRK-independent functional desensitization of β2AR by arrestin2 and 3 mutants. Xenopus oocytes were injected with a mixture of cRNAs for the β2AR (0.05 ng), the G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channel subunits Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 (0.02 ng each), and Gs (0.5 ng) that allows the Gs-coupled β2AR to activate the co-expressed channels as described (26Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27605-27611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As indicated, some oocytes were also co-injected with 8 ng of cRNA for the different forms of arrestin either alone or together with 0.5 ng of GRK3 cRNA. All recordings were performed 3–4 days postinjection. Receptor-activated currents were measured in 16 mmK+ buffer (26Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol.

The agonist-elicited responses were adjusted by baseline subtraction as described (26Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol.

The lack of phosphorylation-independent activity of arrestin3-(1–393) agrees with the direct binding results (Fig. 2). However, the behavior of one mutant in this system differs from its in vitro binding pattern; the shortest truncated arrestin3-(1–379) binds to unphosphorylated β2AR* in vitro, but it does not demonstrate phosphorylation-independent activity in oocytes (compare Figs. 2 and 4). In the presence of GRK3, all mutant forms of both non-visual arrestins demonstrate an ability to desensitize β2AR similar to that of corresponding WT proteins (Fig.3), which indicates that expressed arrestin proteins were fully functional in oocytes. There are obvious differences between the two assays, e.g. temperature (25 °C in oocytes, 30 °C during the binding, and 4 °C during the chromatography in direct binding assay) and the presence of competing molecules (G proteins in oocytes and none in the binding assay). Conceivably, the complex of arrestin3-(1–379) with receptor is stable enough to form in the absence of competition and survive a few minutes at 4 °C on minicolumns (see “Experimental Procedures”) but not stable enough to compete out G protein at 25 °C.To ascertain whether phosphorylation-independent forms of non-visual arrestins retain receptor specificity of the parental proteins (1Lefkowitz R.J.

K5 inhibits the p42/p44 MAP kinase activation and nuclear translocation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, which may be responsible for the down-regulation of VEGF.

In some pathological conditions, such as diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity, regions in the retina become hypoxic. Local hypoxia increases the production of angiogenic stimulators and decreases the production of angiogenic inhibitors, breaking the balance between the positive and negative regulators of angiogenesis. As a result, capillary endothelial cells over proliferate, leading to neovascularization (1Miller J.W. Adamis A.P. Aiello L.P. Diabetes Metab.

Among them, K5 displays the most potent inhibitory activity to endothelial cell proliferation (13Cao Y. Chen A. An S.S.A. Ji R.-W. Davidson D. Cao Y. Llinas M. J. Biol.

Recently, we have shown that intravitreal injection of recombinant K5 prevents the development and arrests the progression of ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization in a rat model (16Zhang D. Kaufman P.L. Gao G. Saunders R.A. Ma J.X. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast to its potential therapeutic significance, little is known about the mechanism underlying the anti-angiogenic activity of K5 and other fragments of plasminogen. The present study reports that K5 down-regulates endogenous VEGF while up-regulating PEDF in cultured retinal vascular cells and in the retina. The results herein support the idea that the regulation of endogenous angiogenic factors may be responsible for the anti-angiogenic activity of K5. Brown Norway rats were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). Care, use, and treatment of all animals in this study were in strict agreement with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research, as well as the guidelines set forth in the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by the Medical University of South Carolina. HRCEC and pericytes were isolated from donor eyes obtained through the South Carolina Lion's Eye Bank Association, as described by Grant and Guay (17Grant M.B. Guay C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1991; 32: 53-64PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. At passage 3 or 4, the purity of the cells in culture was determined. The identity of HRCEC was confirmed by a characteristic cobblestone morphology and the incorporation of acetylated low-density lipoprotein labeled with a fluorescent probe, DiI (1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate) (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA). Purity of the pericyte culture was determined by immunostaining using an fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody specific to α-smooth muscle actin (Sigma). Human K5 was expressed, purified, and analyzed as described previously (16Zhang D. Kaufman P.L. Gao G. Saunders R.A. Ma J.X. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). HRCEC were grown to ∼80% confluence in 100-mm cell culture dishes and shifted to an endothelial cell serum-free medium containing bFGF, EGF, and human plasma fibronectin (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) plus different concentrations of K5. Pericytes were grown to 80% confluence and shifted to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 2% fetal bovine serum and different concentrations of K5. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 or 48 h in normoxia or hypoxia (cells kept in a chamber that was perfused with a mixture of 95% N2 + 5% CO2 for 15 min) and harvested for Western or Northern blot analysis. For Western blot analysis of MAP kinase activity, cells were grown to confluence in 100-mm cell culture dishes, and the culture medium was replaced by the endothelial serum-free medium without bFGF, EGF, and human plasma fibronectin for 24 h to suppress baseline MAP kinase activation. The medium was then replaced with the endothelial cell serum-free medium containing bFGF, EGF, and human plasma fibronectin in the presence or absence of 160 nm K5. After 5 min of incubation, the cells were lysed for analysis of phosphorylation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Induction of retinal neovascularization was performed as described by Smith et al. (18Smith L.E. Wesolowski E. McLellan A. Kostyk S.K. D'Amato R. Sullivan R. D'Amore P.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 101-111PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Pigmented Brown Norway rats were used for this study as they are more susceptible to hyperoxia-induced retinal neovascularization (16Zhang D. Kaufman P.L. Gao G. Saunders R.A. Ma J.X. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). K5 was injected intravitreously, and retinal vasculature analyzed by fluorescein angiography as described previously (16Zhang D. Kaufman P.L. Gao G. Saunders R.A. Ma J.X. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A polyclonal anti-PEDF antibody was raised, affinity purified with a PEDF epitope column, and characterized as described (19Gao G.Q. Li Y. Zhang D.C. Gee S. Crosson C. Ma J.X. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). VEGF and PEDF levels were analyzed by Western blot analysis using the anti-PEDF (2.4 μg/ml) antibody and an anti-VEGF antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Phosphorylation of p42/p44 was measured using a phosphorylation-specific antibody (1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The retina was dissected 24 h after intravitreal injection of K5 or PBS (control). Nuclear proteins were prepared as described (20Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). The same amount of nuclear proteins was applied to Western blot analysis using an anti-HIF-1α antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:500 dilution. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagents (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Total RNA was hybridized with a cDNA probe of PEDF in the Ultrahyb Solution (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) following the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA blot was stripped and re-probed with the rat VEGF cDNA and then probed with a labeled oligonucleotide specific for 18 S RNA. The RNA levels were semiquantified by densitometry and normalized by 18 S RNA levels. Each analysis was repeated at least twice, and results averaged. The purity of primary HRCEC was demonstrated by the uptake of low density lipoprotein, and the nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. More than 95% of the cells in the HRCEC culture were low density lipoprotein receptor positive, indicating their identity as endothelial cells (Fig.1 A). Similarly, the purity of the pericyte cultures was demonstrated by immunostaining with an fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-α-smooth muscle actin antibody (Fig. 1 B). In primary HRCEC, K5 decreased VEGF level in a concentration-dependent manner from 40 to 640 nm(Fig. 2). At 640 nm, K5 showed a maximal inhibition of VEGF expression by 3.5-fold after normalization with β-actin levels (p < 0.01,n = 3) (Fig. 2 A). The effect of K5 on VEGF expression was also examined in HRCEC under hypoxia as VEGF expression is known to be induced by hypoxia, and this induction plays a key role in the development of retinal neovascularization (21Aiello L.P.

Arch. Ophthalmol. 1996; 114: 1252-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous observations, Western blot analysis showed that hypoxia increased the cellular VEGF level by ∼2.3-fold in HRCEC (Fig. 2 B). Under hypoxic conditions, K5 showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of VEGF expression with a maximal inhibition of 13-fold at 640 nm after normalization with β-actin levels, compared with the VEGF level under hypoxia without K5 (p < 0.01,n = 3). VEGF was undetectable in pericytes by Western blot analysis under hypoxia or normoxia (data not shown), indicating a low-expression level of VEGF in pericytes from human retinal capillaries. Under normoxia, K5 (40–320 nm for 24 h) did not significantly change PEDF at the protein level. At 640 nm, K5 only elevated PEDF by 20% (Fig.3 A). Hypoxia down-regulated PEDF expression by 60% in HRCEC (Fig. 3 B). Under hypoxia, K5 increased PEDF protein levels in a concentration-dependent manner from 40 to 160 nm in HRCEC (Fig. 3 B). At 160 nm, K5 treatment produced a 10-fold increase in PEDF levels over the hypoxic control (under hypoxia, no K5) (p < 0.01,n = 3). In pericytes cultured under normoxia, K5 treatment for 24 h increased PEDF levels only at high concentrations, with 32 and 55% increases at 160 and 320 nm K5, respectively (Fig.3 C). Similar to that in HRCEC, hypoxia down-regulated PEDF expression by 55% in pericytes (Fig. 3 D). Under hypoxia, K5 treatment caused significant increases in PEDF expression in a concentration-dependent manner within the range of 40–160 nm (Fig. 3 D). Densitometry analysis showed that K5 at 160 nm up-regulated PEDF by 14-fold over the hypoxic control, at 160 nm after normalization by β-actin (p < 0.01, n = 3). A single-dose intravitreal injection of K5 has been shown to inhibit ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization in rats (16Zhang D. Kaufman P.L. Gao G. Saunders R.A. Ma J.X. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To determine whether this effect correlates with the regulation of VEGF and PEDF expression, retinal VEGF and PEDF levels were measured after K5 injection. K5 was injected intravitreally into the right eye of retinopathy rats at P13 (1 day after the animals were returned from hyperoxia to normoxia), and to age-matched normal rats. The left eye of each animal received the same volume of PBS as a control. Retinal VEGF and PEDF were measured at the RNA and protein levels at 48 or 72 h after K5 injection, respectively. Consistent with our previous observations (16Zhang D. Kaufman P.L. Gao G. Saunders R.A. Ma J.X. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), K5 injection substantially reduced neovascularization (Fig.4, A-C). Correlated with the anti-angiogenic effect, K5 injection resulted in a 15-fold decrease in retinal VEGF levels (p < 0.01, n = 3) and a 2.5-fold increase in PEDF levels, when compared with the control retinas injected with PBS (p < 0.01, n= 3) (Fig. 4 E). In age-matched normal controls (kept in constant normoxia), the K5 injection resulted in only a 2-fold decrease in retinal VEGF levels and a 20% increase in PEDF levels (Fig. 4,D and E). Northern blot analysis demonstrated that K5 decreased the VEGF mRNA level by 2-fold in the retinas with retinopathy (p < 0.01,n = 4), but not in the retinas of age-matched normal animals (Fig. 5 A). Similar to the changes at the protein level, the PEDF mRNA was increased slightly in normal retina, but increased by 1.5-fold in the retina with retinopathy after K5 injection (p < 0.05,n = 4) (Fig. 5 B). The changes at the RNA levels of VEGF and PEDF occurred at 48 h after the injection, 24 h prior to the protein changes. Serum-deprived HRCEC were stimulated with bFGF, and phosphorylation of p42/p44 was measured. A 5-min challenge with bFGF resulted in a 2-fold increase in p42/p44 phosphorylation when compared with those in the unchallenged cells (Fig. 6 A). The difference between challenged and unchallenged cells was considered to reflect the activation of p42/p44 by bFGF, as reported previously (23Hata Y. Rook S.L. Aiello L.P. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). K5 decreased the bFGF-induced p42/p44 phosphorylation by 2-fold in HRCEC (Fig. 6 A). Since VEGF also regulates MAP kinase activity, we determined whether or not K5 inhibition of MAP kinase activity occurred prior to the VEGF change by measuring the time course of the K5 effect on VEGF. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the earliest VEGF decrease was detected at 3 h after the K5 treatment, while decreased p42/p44 phosphorylation appeared 5 min after the K5 addition (Fig.6 A), suggesting that the MAP kinase changes are upstream of the VEGF decrease. The retinas from rats with retinopathy and age-matched normal rats were dissected and pooled for MAP kinase activity assay 48 h after the K5 injection. Consistent with the results in HRCEC, K5 decreased p42/p44 phosphorylation by 2.5-fold in the retina of the retinopathy model, but not in the age-matched normal control (Fig.6 C). Nuclear HIF-1α levels were measured in the retinas with neovascularization and in the retinas of age-matched normal rats, after PBS or K5 injection. Nuclear HIF-1α levels were 4 times higher in the retina with neovascularization than that in the normal retina. Intravitreal injection of K5 significantly decreased nuclear HIF-1α level in the retinas with neovascularization (p < 0.05,n = 3) but not in the age-matched normal rats (Fig.7). K5 is a potent angiogenic inhibitor and is believed to have therapeutic potential in the treatment of solid tumors (13Cao Y. Chen A. An S.S.A. Ji R.-W. Davidson D. Cao Y. Llinas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22924-22928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that intravitreal injection of K5 prevents the development and stops the progression of ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization in rats (16Zhang D. Kaufman P.L. Gao G. Saunders R.A. Ma J.X. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Toward the understanding of its mechanism, the present study demonstrates that K5 down-regulates the expression of an endogenous angiogenic stimulator, VEGF, through inhibiting HIF-1 and p42/p44 MAP kinase activation, while enhancing the expression of an angiogenic inhibitor, PEDF. This regulation leads to the restoration of a normal balance between angiogenic stimulators and inhibitors. These results reveal a link between angiogenic inhibitors and angiogenic stimulators. It is evident that there exists a delicate balance between angiogenic stimulators and angiogenic inhibitors, and this balance plays a key role in maintaining the homeostasis of angiogenesis (6Dawson D.W. Volpert O.V. Gillis P. Crawford S.E. Xu H. Benedict W. Bouck N.P. Science. 1999; 285: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar, 7Jimenez B. Volpert O.V. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 78: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Gao G.Q. Li Y. Zhang D.C. Gee S. Crosson C. Ma J.X. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Under certain hypoxic conditions in the retina as found in proliferative diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity, the angiogenic stimulators are overproduced while the angiogenic inhibitors are decreased (7Jimenez B. Volpert O.V. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 78: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Gao G.Q. Li Y. Zhang D.C. Gee S. Crosson C. Ma J.X. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The consequent disruption in the balance between these factors results in retinal neovascularization. VEGF is a major angiogenic stimulator in the retina, and increased VEGF levels have been shown to be a common pathologic factor in neovascularizing ocular diseases of humans, as well as in the animal model of ischemia-induced retinopathy (21Aiello L.P. Avery R.L. Arrigg P.G. Keyt B.A. Jampel H.D. Shah S.T. Pasquale L.R. Thieme H. Iwamoto M.A. Park J.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1480-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (3436) Google Scholar, 24Pe'er J.

Ophthalmol. 1994; 118: 445-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). PEDF has been identified as a major angiogenic inhibitor in the vitreous (6Dawson D.W. Volpert O.V. Gillis P. Crawford S.E. Xu H. Benedict W. Bouck N.P. Science. 1999; 285: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Decreased PEDF levels have been associated with ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization and proliferative diabetic retinopathy in patients (19Gao G.Q. Li Y. Zhang D.C. Gee S. Crosson C. Ma J.X. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 27Yamamoto H. Hayashi H. Umeda N. Miyajima-Uchida H. Ozaki H. Tombran-Tink K. Oshima K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 2001; 42: S244Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that the ratio between angiogenic stimulators and inhibitors is crucial for the control of angiogenesis in the retina. Elevated retinal angiogenic stimulators such as VEGF and decreased angiogenic inhibitors such as PEDF, resulting in an increased ratio of angiogenic stimulators to angiogenic inhibitors, contribute to retinal neovascularization in the ischemia-induced retinopathy rat model (19Gao G.Q. Li Y. Zhang D.C. Gee S. Crosson C. Ma J.X. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The down-regulation of VEGF and the up-regulation of PEDF by K5 can decrease the VEGF/PEDF ratio to near normal levels, restoring the balance between angiogenic stimulators and inhibitors. Therefore, the regulation of endogenous angiogenic stimulators and inhibitors may be responsible for the anti-angiogenic effect of K5. Multiple angiogenic stimulators and inhibitors are expressed in the retina and vascular cells (28Jacobson B. Basu P.K. Hasany S.M. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1984; 102: 1543-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 29Glaser B.M. Campochiaro P.A. Davis J.L. Sato M. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1985; 103: 1870-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Insulin-like growth factor-1 has been shown to regulate the expression of VEGF in RPE cells (30Punglia R.S. Lu M. Hsu J. Kuroki M. Tolentino M.J. Keough K. Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. D'Amato R.J. Adamis A.P. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1619-1626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that regulatory interactions exist among angiogenic stimulators. However, the regulatory interactions between the two counter-balancing systems, angiogenic stimulators and inhibitors, have not been reported previously. The present study demonstrates for the first time that an angiogenic inhibitor can suppress the expression of angiogenic stimulators while enhancing the expression of other endogenous angiogenic inhibitors. These regulatory interactions accelerate the restoration of the balance between angiogenic stimulators and inhibitors and thus, may represent a mechanism of angiogenic control. HIF-1 is a major positive regulator of VEGF expression under hypoxia (31Morwenna S. Ratcliffe W.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 32Ferrara N. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 527-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Nuclear translocation of HIF-1α is a critical step in the induction of VEGF expression. The present study demonstrated that the nuclear HIF-1α level was elevated significantly in the retina with neovascularization, correlating with increased VEGF expression (19Gao G.Q. Li Y. Zhang D.C. Gee S. Crosson C. Ma J.X. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). K5 injection significantly reduced the nuclear HIF-1α levels in the retina of the retinopathy model, suggesting a decreased HIF-1α nuclear translocation. These results suggest that inhibiting HIF-1 activation is responsible, at least partially, for the decreased VEGF expression by K5. The p42/p44 MAP kinase pathway has been suggested to play a role in the regulation of VEGF expression (33Milanini J. Vinals F. Pouyssegur J. Pages G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18165-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 34Pages G. Milanini J. Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Vinals F. Pouyssegur J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 902: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 35Sodhi A. Montaner S. Patel V. Zohar M. Bais C. Mesri E.A. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4873-4880PubMed Google Scholar). Our results show that K5 inhibits the activation of p42/p44. As VEGF itself is an activator of this pathway through its interactions with VEGF receptors (36Seko Y. Takahashi N. Tobe K. Ueki K. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 37Takahashi T. Ueno H. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2221-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), we have also determined if the decreased MAP kinase activation by K5 is a cause, or a consequence, of decreased VEGF levels. In endothelial cells, K5 displayed a fast inhibition of p42/p44 activation, and this effect occurred as early as 5 min after the addition of K5, while the earliest change in VEGF levels occurred at 3 h after the addition of K5, suggesting that the MAP kinase inhibition occurs prior to the down-regulation of VEGF and is unlikely a consequence of the decreased VEGF levels. Interestingly, angiostatin has recently been shown to reduce the activation of MAP kinase ERK-1/ERK-2 (p42/p44) in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (38Redlitz A. Daum G. Sage E.H. J. Vasc. Res. 1999; 36: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, angiostatin and K5 may have similar anti-angiogenic mechanisms. The MAP kinase pathway is a well studied intracellular signal transduction pathway mediating biological effects of many activated receptors (39Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 40Terada Y. Nakashima O. Inoshita S. Kuwahara M. Sasaki S. Marumo F. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1999; 14: 45-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The finding that K5 specifically inhibits the activation of p42/p44 raises the question of how K5 interacts with this intracellular pathway. Recently, we have performed a receptor-binding assay using 125I-labeled K5 and cultured endothelial cells. No specific binding of K5 with endothelial cells was detected (data not shown), suggesting that K5 does not have a specific receptor on endothelial cells. As VEGF can also activate the MAP kinase pathway through its receptor (36Seko Y. Takahashi N. Tobe K. Ueki K. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), blocking the VEGF receptor may also result in the inhibition of MAP kinase pathway. Therefore, we have also measured the effect of K5 on VEGF binding with VEGF receptor, and the results showed that K5 does not interfere with VEGF binding to its receptor (data not shown). These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of K5 on MAP kinase is neither through binding to a specific receptor on the endothelial cells nor through blocking the VEGF binding. It is possible that K5 may block the binding of other factors to their receptors and subsequently inhibit certain signal transduction pathways. It is also possible that the K5 effect is mediated by molecules in the extracellular matrix such as integrin that is essential for the sustained activation of MAP kinase by angiogenic stimulators (41Eliceiri B.P. Klemke R. Stromblad S. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 42Tarui T. Miles L.A. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39562-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It remains a future challenge to determine how K5 inhibits the MAP kinase pathway. In contrast to VEGF, little is known about the regulation of PEDF expression. Dawson et al. (6Dawson D.W. Volpert O.V. Gillis P. Crawford S.E. Xu H. Benedict W. Bouck N.P. Science. 1999; 285: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar) showed that PEDF is regulated by oxygen concentration in a retinoblastoma cell line only at the protein level. However, Coljee et al. (43Coljee V.W. Rotenberg M.O. Tresini M. Francis M.K. Cristofalo V.J. Sell C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 442-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the mRNA level of PEDF (EPC-1/PEDF) is regulated by serum stimulation in fibroblasts. Their studies demonstrated that the decreased PEDF mRNA level by serum stimulation results from a reduced RNA stability and changed hnRNA processing. Recently, we have shown that the PEDF mRNA is decreased in the retina of the rat model of ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization (19Gao G.Q. Li Y. Zhang D.C. Gee S. Crosson C. Ma J.X. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The discrepancy between these observations suggests that PEDF expression may be regulated at different levels depending on cell types and regulators. Regulation of PEDF expression by other growth factors and transcription factors has not been reported previously. Herein we show that K5 up-regulates PEDF expression in vascular cells and in the retina. As PEDF has been shown to induce apoptosis (44Stellmach V. Crawford S.E. Zhou W. Bouck N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2593-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), the up-regulation of PEDF expression by K5 may be responsible for K5's effect on the induction of apoptosis in endothelial cells. The present study demonstrates that K5 has more significant regulation of VEGF and PEDF expression under hypoxia than under normoxia. This may be explained by the fact that the basal level of VEGF is elevated, while that of PEDF is decreased by hypoxia in the absence of K5. In newborn rats, exposure to hyperoxia for 5 days followed by exposure to normoxia results in local hypoxia in the retina. The retinal hypoxia elevates VEGF, but reduces PEDF levels. Consistent with the findings in cultured vascular cells, the K5 regulation on VEGF and PEDF is more significant in the retinopathy animal model than in normal retinas. As increased retinal VEGF expression and decreased PEDF are believed to be the cause of retinal neovascularization (19Gao G.Q. Li Y. Zhang D.C. Gee S. Crosson C. Ma J.X. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), the more significant regulation of VEGF and PEDF by K5 in the retinopathy model than in normal controls may explain our previous observation that K5 has anti-angiogenic activity only in the retina with neovascularization, but not in the normal retina (16Zhang D. Kaufman P.L. Gao G. Saunders R.A. Ma J.X. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).

Compared with the vector control (GM1−) cell lines, GM1+ cells exhibited reduced cell proliferation by stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF).

Gangliosides, sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids are ubiquitously expressed in embryonal and adult tissues of mammals and birds (1.Wiegandt H. Glycolipids. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1985: 199-260Google Scholar). In particular, they are enriched in nervous tissues, and the structures of the carbohydrate moiety are strictly regulated according to the developmental stages and tissue differentiation (1.Wiegandt H.

A clear demonstration of the interaction between gangliosides and other receptor molecules has never been reported except for the binding of nerve growth factor receptor with GM1 (11.Mutoh T.

This receptor exerts roles through multiple phosphorylation cascades, each of which begins with the phosphorylation of the receptor itself. Recently, many of the participating molecules and substrates of PDGF/PDGFR effects have been identified, and their sites of interaction were mapped (12.DeMali K.A. Whiteford C.C. Ulug E.T.

Physiol. 1998; 275: L843-L851PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that caveolae fractions from unstimulated fibroblasts contained PDGFR, Ras, Raf-1, MAP kinase kinase 1, and MAPK, and PDGF stimulation activated MAP kinase in the caveolae fraction, indicating that these components are functional in vivo. platelet-derived growth factor platelet-derived growth factor receptor mitogen-activated protein kinase (meaning ERK1/2) glycosphingolipid(s) glycolipid-enriched microdomain monoclonal antibody 4-GalNAc-T, β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase or GM2/GD2 synthase 3-Gal-T, β1,3-galactosyltransferase or GM1 synthase fluorescein isothiocyanate 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.

The nomenclature of gangliosides is based on that of Svennerholm (54.Svennerholm L. J. Neurochem. 1963; 10: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar) Caveolae have been thought to be specialized plasmalemmal microdomains originally studied in numerous cell types for their involvement in the transcytosis of macromolecules (14.Anderson R.G. Kamen B.A. Rothberg K.G. Lacey S.W. Science. 1992; 255: 410-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). They are enriched in glycosphingolipids (GSLs), cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and lipid-anchored membrane proteins, and they are characterized by a light buoyant density and resistance to solubilization by Triton X-100 at 4 °C. GSLs are enriched in this detergent-insoluble microdomain, that is almost equal to GEM (15.Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 16.Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2549) Google Scholar). (GEM was used in this article for this microdomain.) In particular, GM1 has been suggested to be a useful marker of GEM as well as a main structural protein, caveolin. If gangliosides play roles in the modulation of various receptor molecules as described above, it may be possible that gangliosides such as GM1 are involved in the regulation of signaling as a functional component of GEM, being more than an indicator of the microdomain. In fact, Bremer et al. (17.Bremer E.G. Hakomori S. Bowen-Pope D.F. Raines E. Ross R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6818-6825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Bremer E.G. Schlessinger J. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2434-2440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that GM3 and/or GM1 added to the culture medium of cells suppressed the cell growth and/or phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor and PDGFR. Exogenous GM1, in turn, enhanced the phosphorylation of nerve growth factor receptor TrkA, resulting in neurite extension of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (11.Mutoh T. Tokuda A. Miyadai T. Hamaguchi M. Fujiki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5087-5091Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In this study, we have established transfectant cells of mouse fibroblast line Swiss 3T3 highly expressing GM1 using cloned cDNAs of GM2/GD2 synthase (19.Nagata Y. Yamashiro S. Yodoi J. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12082-12089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and GM1 synthase (20.Miyazaki H. Fukumoto S. Okada M. Hasegawa T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24794-24799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Then, we analyzed the effects of GM1 expression on the cell proliferation, phosphorylation of PDGFR/MAPK after PDGF stimulation, and also on the intracellular localization of PDGFR. The neo-expression of GM1 suppressed both cell proliferation and phosphorylation levels of PDGFR and MAPK in response to PDGF as reported in the experiments with exogenous GM1 (17.Bremer E.G. Hakomori S. Bowen-Pope D.F. Raines E. Ross R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6818-6825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the majority of PDGFR has moved from GEM to the non-GEM fraction, which appeared to be a major mechanism for the reduced PDGF/PDGFR signals in GM1+ cells. Moreover, it appeared that GM1 bound PDGFR in GEM, indicating that GM1 is not only a marker of the GEM microdomain, but an important functional component probably modulating both GEM structure and PDGFR activity. PDGF-BB was purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Anti-PDGF receptor β (rabbit IgG, 958; goat IgG M-20), anti-caveolin-1 (rabbit IgG), anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (PY20), donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-MAPK rabbit IgG, anti-phospho MAPK rabbit IgG, anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Cholera toxin B subunit conjugated with biotin was from LIST Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA). ECL detection reagent was from Invitrogen (Boston, MA). Protein A-Sepharose CL4B beads were from Amersham Bioscience Inc. (Buckinghamshire, UK). Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Swiss 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's essential medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For cell growth assay, cells were cultured in 48-well plates (Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ), and serum-starved for 24 h before PDGF (50 ng/ml) treatment. After treatment for the indicated time, MTT assay was performed. Human β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (β1,4-GalNAc-T, GM2/GD2 synthase) cDNA pM2T1–1 and β1,3-galactosyltransferase (β1,3-Gal-T, GM1 synthase) cDNA pM1T9 were digested by XhoI and the fragments containing the coding regions were inserted into the XhoI site of pMIKneo to obtain the pMIKneo/β1,4-GalNAc-T and pMIKneo/β1,3-Gal-T, respectively. pMIKneo is a mammalian expression vector with SRα promoter and was provided by Dr. Maruyama of Tokyo Medical and Dental University. Swiss 3T3 cells used for cDNA transfection were plated in a 60-mm plastic tissue culture plate (Falcon). Two kinds of cDNAs were transfected into cells with LipofectAMINETM (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfectants were selected in the presence of 250 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). The cell surface expression of gangliosides was analyzed by flow cytometry (Beckton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA), using the anti-ganglioside monoclonal antibodies (mAb); M2590 (anti-GM3), mAb10-11 (anti-GM2), mAb92-22 (anti-GD1a), mAbR24 (anti-GD3), mAb3F8 (anti-GD2), mAb370 (anti-GD1b), and mAb549 (anti-GT1b). The cells were incubated with mAbs for 45 min on ice and then stained with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM or IgG (Cappel, Durham, NC). To analyze GM1, cells were incubated with the cholera toxin B subunit-biotin conjugates for 45 min on ice, and then stained with FITC-conjugated avidin (EY Laboratories, San Mateo, CA). Control cells were prepared using the second antibody alone. Two × 104 cells were seeded in 48-well plates. After serum deprivation for 24 h, they were cultured in the presence of PDGF (50 ng/ml) and 1% fetal calf serum. At day 0, 1, and 2 of culture, MTT assay was performed. Growth of cells was quantitated by assessing the reduction of MTT to formazan, measured as the absorbance at 590 nm using an enzyme-linkd immunosorbent assay reader (System Instruments, Japan). Cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/12 ml in two 10-cm plates, and serum-starved for 6 h before PDGF treatment. After treatment, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 units/ml aprotinin). Lysed cells were centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 10 min. For MAPK phosphorylation assay, lysates were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotted with antibodies reactive with MAPK (ERK1/2) or phospho-MAPK. For PDGF receptor phosphorylation assay, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PDGFR antibody (958) before immunoblotting. Briefly, precleared samples were incubated with antibody for 1 h, and then incubated with protein A-Sepharose CL4B beads overnight. The beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer. The precipitates were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted, and then immunoblotted with anti-PDGFR antibody or PY20. The bands were detected by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and the ECL detection system (PerkinElmer Life Science) in both assays. Five × 107 cells were plated in five 15-cm dishes, and cultured up to 90% confluency. Then the cells were serum-starved for 6 h, and treated with PDGF (50 ng/ml) for 10 min. After treatment, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmNa3VO4, collected, suspended in 1 ml of MNE buffer (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) containing 1% Triton X-100, then Dounce homogenized 20 times, and mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose (w/v) in MNE buffer. Then, samples were placed on the bottom of Ultra-Clear Centrifuge Tubes (Beckman Instruments). Two ml of 30% sucrose in MNE buffer was overlaid, and 1 ml of 5% sucrose in MNE buffer was layered on the top. These samples were centrifuged for 16 h at 20,000 × g. The entire procedure was performed at 4 °C. Five hundred ml each was fractionated from the top. An opaque band located immediately above the 5% interface (fraction 3) was collected and designated the GEM fraction. A sample from the bottom fraction (fraction 10) was collected and designated the non-GEM fraction. Sample fractions isolated as described above were 500 μl each. Fifty μl of each sample fraction was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone 3 times, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. The remaining samples were dialyzed twice for 4 h against the dialysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mmNa pyrophosphate, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EDTA) before immunoprecipitation with anti-PDGFR antibody. After immunoprecipitation, beads were washed 4 times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40/0.1% SDS), and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 107/15 ml in five 15-cm plates, and serum starved for 6 h before PDGF treatment. Then, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmNa2VO4, and cross-linked at room temperature using 8.7 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3; Pierce, Rockford, IL) in 25 mm HEPES (pH 8.5), 120 mmNaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm EGTA. The reaction was terminated after 30 min. Cells were then subjected to GEM isolation. Lipid fractions were extracted from about 200 μl of packed cells using chloroform/methanol (2:1, 1:1, 1:2) sequentially. After desalting, gangliosides were isolated by anion exchange column chromatography with DEAE-Sephadex A-50 (Amersham Biosciences Inc.). Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed with high performance TLC plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) using a solvent system of chloroform, methanol, 0.2% CaCl2 (55:45:10). GEM fraction was isolated from V1 cells and served for immunoprecipitation with anti-PDGFR antibody. The precipitates were mixed with 20 μl of tyrosine kinase assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mmMnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μm Na3VO4). Then, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and GM1 were added before incubation at 30 °C for 10 min. Then, samples were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE, and relative kinase activity was measured with autoradiography. Intracelular localization of GM1 and PDGFR was analyzed by antibody staining. Cells were cultured on a cover glass and fixed with cold acetone containing 10% phosphate-buffered saline at −20 °C for 10 min. PDGFR was stained with anti-PDGFR antibody (958) and FITC anti-rabbit antibody (BIOSOURCE Int., Camarillo, CA). GM1 was stained with rhodamine-conjugated choleratoxin B (LIST Biological Laboratories Inc.). Staining pattern was analyzed with confocal microscopy (μRadianceTM, Bio-Rad Microscience Lab, Tokyo). After the transfection of Swiss 3T3 cells with β1,4-GalNAc-T expression vector (pMIKneo/β1,4-GalNAc-T) and β1,3-Gal-T expression vector (pMIKneo/β1,3-Gal-T), or pMIKneo alone, two transfectants (M1 and M3) and two vector control lines (V1 and V2) were established. Expression profiles of gangliosides were examined by flow cytometry (Fig. 1). Among the gangliosides examined, expression levels of GM1 markedly increased in the transfectants (M3 and M6). Expression levels of other gangliosides showed no change compared with those in the vector control lines (V1 and V2). The proliferation of the GM1 transfectants (M3 and M6) and the vector control lines (V1 and V2) were compared by MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 2, the GM1 transfectants showed a reduced growth rate in the presence of PDGF. The absorbance (590 nm) of transfectants (M3 and M6) in MTT assay was about 30–40% of that of vector control lines (V1 and V2). In the absence of PDGF, the growth of the transfectants was similar to that of vector control cells (data not shown). Consequently, we found endogenously expressed GM1 suppressed PDGF-dependent growth of Swiss 3T3 cells. To analyze the alteration of PDGF receptor (PDGFR) and its downstream signaling molecules, the activation of MAPK was examined by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 3A). After 6 h of serum deprivation, 50 ng/ml PDGF was added and incubated for 5, 10, 30, 60, or 120 min. Then cells were lysed, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-MAPK antibody. After that, the membrane was reblotted with anti-phosphorylated MAPK antibody. The intensity of MAPK bands was almost equivalent between transfectants (M3 and M6) and control lines (V1 and V2) and no apparent change in the intensity was observed during the incubation. For 5–10 min after PDGF addition, the phosphorylation level of MAPK was equivalent between the two groups. However, after 30–120 min, the transfectants showed earlier reduction in the activation levels of MAPK than those of vector control lines (Fig. 3B). After analysis of the phosphorylation level of MAPK, the activation of PDGFR was examined by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (Fig. 4). After 6 h of serum deprivation, 50 ng/ml PDGF was added and incubated for 5 or 60 min. Then, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PDGFR antibody. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20), (Fig. 4A, upper). Subsequently, the membrane was reblotted with anti-PDGFR antibody (Fig. 4A, lower). Phosphorylation levels of PDGFR in the transfectants were generally lower than those in vector control lines (Fig. 4B). It is well known that GM1 localizes in GEM and has been used as a marker of GEM. PDGFR was found in caveolae by Anderson and co-workers (21.Liu P. Ying Y. Ko Y.G. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10299-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Therefore, we isolated GEM to compare the phosphorylation levels of PDGFR in GEM and non-GEM. To confirm the technique for the isolation of GEM, we isolated GEM of transfectant cells (M3) and immunoblotting was performed with anti-caveolin-1 antibody and cholera toxin B subunit to identify GM1. As shown in Fig. 5, both caveolin-1 and GM1 were detected mainly in fraction 3. Both were present only in the low density fractions, and not in high density fractions such as fractions 9 and 10 in which soluble proteins were present. Therefore, we used fraction 3 as the GEM, and fraction 10 as the non-GEM fraction in the following experiments. We isolated the GEM fraction and the non-GEM fraction from each cell line. In all cell lines, the isolated GEM fraction contained 0.05 mg of total protein, and the non-GEM fraction contained 0.5 mg of total protein. They were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PDGFR antibody. Immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with anti-PDGFR antibody (Fig. 6A, top). Surprisingly, PDGFR in GEM of the transfectants (M3 and M6) was clearly and significantly reduced compared with that in non-GEM, although the vector control lines (V1 and V2) showed an almost equal distribution of PDGFR between GEM and non-GEM (Fig. 6, A and B, and Table I). Then, the membrane was reblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) to determine the phosphorylation of PDGFR (Fig. 6A). The phosphorylation of PDGFR was detected only in PDGF-treated samples in both the transfectants and vector controls, and the intensity of the phosphorylated bands was almost proportional to that of PDGFR bands stained with anti-PDGFR antibody (Fig. 6, A and C, and Table I). A part of GEM and the non-GEM fractions was trichloroacetic acid precipitated, separated on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-caveolin-1 antibody or the cholera toxin B subunit (Fig. 6A, bottom), confirming that caveolin-1 was present in GEM in both transfectants and vector controls, and that GM1 was enriched in the GEM fraction of the transfectants.Table IPDGFR was dispersed from GEM/DIM in GM1+transfectant cells−PDGFR+PDGFRM3M6M3M6V10.006ap values obtained with paired t test.0.0070.0130.009V20.0230.0130.0090.030GEMGEM + non-GEMM3M6M3M6V10.008ap values obtained with paired t test.0.0220.0120.010V20.0060.0080.0150.011A.

Significant differences in the ratio of PDGFR as GEM/non-GEM shown in Fig. 6B B. Significant differences in the relative intensity of phospho-PDGFR bands shown in Fig. 6C Cross-linking of PDGFR revealed that dimer bands could be detected in GEM fractions of control cells after PDGF treatment, but not in GEM fractions of the transfectant cells. Only a faint dimer band appeared in non-GEM of M6, but not in that of M3 (Fig. 7). To analyze the complex formation of PDGFR with GM1, the GEM fraction and non-GEM fraction were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PDGFR antibody. Then, immunoprecipitates were extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:1), and the extracted samples were subjected to TLC immunostaining. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was blotted with cholera toxin B subunit, resulting in the detection of definite GM1 bands in the GEM fraction and faint bands in the non-GEM fraction (Fig. 8A). There was no significant difference in the intensity of GM1 bands between transfectants and vector controls (Fig. 8B), suggesting that the majority of the increased GM1 in the transfectants existed in GEM, but it was difficult for them to bind to PDGFR. The ratio of immunoprecipitated GM1 to PDGFR in GEM was markedly and significantly high in GM2+ cells (Fig. 8C). The immunoprecipitates were also subjected to immunoblotting with anti-caveolin-1 antibody. Caveolin-1 could not be detected (data not shown). To analyze the effects of GM1 on the PDGFR kinase activity, immunoprecipitated PDGFR served for kinase assay in the presence of various amounts of GM1. As shown in Fig. 9, a low concentration of GM1 rather enhanced the kinase activity, while relatively high concentration of GM1 (higher than 100 μm) suppressed the kinase in a dose-dependent manner. To confirm the dispersion of PDGFR from GEM in the transfectants, cytostaining of GM1 and PDGFR was performed. GM1 was stained mainly on the cell membrane in both vector controls and transfectants, whereas the intensity was much stronger in the transfectant cells as expected (Fig. 10, left column). As for PDGFR, it was stained in membrane and cytoplasm as a granular pattern (Fig. 10, middle column). Merge of these two staining patterns revealed contrasting results between GM1− cells and GM1+ cells. The majority of GM1 was overlapped with PDGFR showing yellow color mainly around the cell membrane in the control cells (Fig. 10, right column). The faint green color seemed to represent PDGFR in the non-GEM fraction. In contrast, the yellow color indicating co-localizing GM1 and PDGFR was scarcely detected in the transfectants, and either the single red color (GM1/GEM) or single green color (PDGFR/non-GEM) was prominently detectable. These results as shown with higher magnification at the bottom were in good accordance with the results of the biochemical fractionation experiments as summarized in Fig. 11.Figure 11A scheme to present the change in PDGFR localization by the overexpression of GM1 in GEM. Overexpressed GM1 might alter the GEM organization resulting in the dispersion of PDGFR to the non-GEM fraction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cellular events regulated with signals via PDGF/PDGFR include cytoskeletal rearrangement and migration (22.Seppa H.

https://openalex.org/W2097336990,"Huntington's disease (HD) is one of eight established triplet repeat neurodegenerative disorders, which are collectively caused by the genetic expansion of polyglutamine repeats. While the mechanism(s) by which polyglutamine expansion causes neurodegeneration in each of these disorders is being intensely investigated, the underlying cause of polyglutamine toxicity has not been fully elucidated. A number of studies have focused on the potential role of protein aggregation and disruption of the proteasome proteolytic pathway in polyglutamine-mediated neurodegeneration. However, at present it is not clear whether polyglutamine-mediated protein aggregation is sufficient to induce cell death, nor has it been clearly determined whether proteasome inhibition precedes, coincides, or occurs as the result of the formation of polyglutamine-associated protein aggregation. To address these important components of polyglutamine toxicity, in the present study we utilized neural SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with polyglutamine-green fluorescent protein constructs to examine the effects of polyglutamine expansion on protein aggregation, proteasome activity, and neural cell survival. Data from the present study demonstrate that polyglutamine expansion does not dramatically impair proteasome activity or elevate protein aggregate formation under basal conditions, but does significantly impair the ability of the proteasome to respond to stress, and increases stress-induced protein aggregation following stress, all in the absence of neural cell death.

The proteasome is a large intracellular multicatalytic protease that is responsible for the majority of overall protein degradation, including the degradation of most oxidized, misfolded, and aggregated proteins (16.Ding Q.

However, at present the characterization of proteasome inhibition, and role of proteasome inhibition in polyglutamine disorders, has not been fully elucidated. Protein aggregation is increased in polyglutamine disorders (1.Orr H.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 2.Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev.

Szweda L.I. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that elevated levels of protein aggregates in polyglutamine disorders may ultimately inhibit proteasome activity (14.Waelter S.

Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). In the present study we analyzed polyglutamine aggregation, proteasome activity, and cell death in neural SH-SY5Y cells that were stably transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) containing 19, 56, or 80 glutamine repeats. Data presented in this report indicate that the ability to elevate proteasome activity is impaired in 56- and 80-glutamine GFP-transfected cells and precedes formation of stable GFP aggregates, all in the absence of neural cell death. Neural SH-SY5Y cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection and grown in minimal essential medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Neural SH-SY5Y cells in 60-mm dishes, at 60–70% confluence, were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent, following manufacturer's instructions (37.Ding Q. Keller J.N. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1010-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with 2 μg of empty pcDNA3.1 vector or pcDNA3.1 containing 19, 56, or 80 glutamines, which have been ligated to GFP, resulting in 19-, 56-, and 80-glutamine GFP, respectively. Following 24 h transfection, cells were placed under selection using G418 (800 μg/ml) and individual clones of each cell line selected. Heat shock was induced by placing cells in a 43 °C CO2 incubator for the indicated period of time, with cells then immediately placed in adjacent 37 °C incubator. For analysis of cellular proliferation cells were plated at 40% confluence (5 × 104) and incubated overnight in minimal essential medium containing 1% serum (v/v). The following day the medium was replaced with normal growth medium, and following 96-h incubation cells were removed by mild trypsinization and counted. The percent increase in proliferation was then calculated by dividing the number of trypan blue-negative cells collected from the initial seeding concentration. Cell viability was determined by MTT conversion and propidium iodide staining as described previously (8.Moulder K.L. Onodera O. Burke J.R. Strittmatter W.J. Johnson E.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 705-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Satyal S.H. Schmidt E. Kitagawa K. Sondheimer N. Lindquist S. Kramer J.M. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 687-697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viable cells contain an intact membrane that is impermeable to propidium iodide, thus allowing for the identification of viable cells. At least six cultures were utilized for each time point. Visible aggregate formation was determined using a Ziess fluorescence microscope equipped with a digital camera and Attofluor software. Living GFP-positive cells were counted in randomly chosen fields and the percentage of cells exhibiting aggregates calculated. In each experiment at least 30 cells were counted per dish, with a minimum of four dishes utilized for each time point. Nuclear aggregation was assessed by co-localization of aggregates with propidium iodide as described previously (9.Satyal S.H. Schmidt E. Kitagawa K. Sondheimer N. Lindquist S. Kramer J.M. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5750-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated with Triton X-100 prior to the addition of propidium iodide, to allow propidium iodide to stain all nuclei. Analysis of protein aggregation by electron microscopy was conducted as described previously (14.Waelter S. Boeddrich A. Lurz R. Scherzinger E. Lueder G. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1393-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), with some minor modifications. Briefly, following experimental treatment cells were rinsed in ice-cold 0.1m Sorenson's buffer (pH 7.4), followed by 30-min fixation in 3.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m Sorenson's solution (v/v), followed by a 30-min incubation in 1% osmium tetroxide. Cells were then subject to dehydration via incubations in increasing concentrations of ethanol and embedded in Eponate 12 resin. The tissue was then sectioned (60 nm), placed into copper grids, and imaged using a Philips CM100 EM (Philips Electron Optics, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). For analysis of protein aggregation in nondenaturing gels, cells were collected in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline-containing protease inhibitor mixture (Invitrogen), following experimental treatment. Cells were then homogenized on ice and protein aliquots (50 μg) separated within a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel using electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions. Proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and immunoreacted with α-GFP antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and developed using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). For determinations of aggregate stability protein aliquots were incubated for 1 h in 1% SDS (v/v) and placed for 10 min in boiling water prior to Western blot analysis. Proteasome activity was determined as described previously (16.Ding Q. Keller J.N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 574-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 25.Keller J.N. Hanni K.B.

Blood Flow Metab. 2000; 20: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were collected and aliquots (1 μg/μl) generated in proteasome activity buffer (10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 0.5 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 2 mmol/liter ATP, and 5 mmol/liter MgCl2). Chyomotrypsin-like and postglutamyl peptidase activities of the proteasome were determined by measuring the rate of succinyl-leucine-leucine-valine-tyrosine-MCA and succinyl-leucine-leucine-glutamic acid-MCA, respectively. Fluorescence was monitored at 340 nm excitation and 440 nm emission. Northern blot analysis was conducted as described previously (26.Keller J.N. Huang F.F. Zhu H. Yu J. Ho Y.S. Kindy M.S. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2000; 20: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 38.Keller J.N. Kindy M.S. Holtsberg F.W. St. Clair D.K. Yen H.C. Germeyer A. Steiner S.M. Bruce-Keller A.J.

The integrity and quality of RNA were confirmed for each sample by gel analysis prior to beginning Northern procedure. A total of 8 μg of RNA for each sample was size-fractioned by electrophoresis in a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel. The RNA was then transferred to a Hybond+ nylon membrane, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled probe, and imaged using a Fuji Phosphoimager. Statistical significance was determined using a t test, with a maximum p value of < 0.05 required for significance. In the present report we conducted studies in neural SH-SY5Y cells that have been stably transfected with GFP containing 19, 56, or 80 glutamines as described previously (8.Moulder K.L. Onodera O. Burke J.R. Strittmatter W.J. Johnson E.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 705-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells transfected with 19-, 56- or 80-glutamine GFP demonstrated GFP fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm and had a similar shape (Fig. 1). All cell lines proliferated at similar rates (Fig. 1), and based on Western blot analysis, expressed similar levels of GFP (data not shown). Under basal conditions the 19-glutamine GFP-transfected cells presented almost no GFP aggregates (<1%), while 56- and 80-glutamine GFP both exhibited low level aggregate formation (∼1–3% of cells). In contrast to basal conditions, following increasing durations of heat shock (43 °C), there was observed to be a significant increase in GFP aggregate formation in 56- and 80-glutamine GFP, but not 19-glutamine GFP-transfected cells (Fig. 1). Aggregates appeared to be primarily cytosolic, with multiple aggregates present in individual cells (Fig. 1). The effect of heat shock on protein aggregation was observed to be dependent on both the severity of heat shock and the amount of time cells were allowed to recover from heat shock. For example, short term heat shock (5 min) caused a rapid and reversible form of aggregate formation in 80-glutamine GFP-transfected cells, without inducing aggregation in 19-glutamine GFP-transfected cells (Fig. 2). Following heat shock of greater that 5 min, no early transitory elevations in protein aggregation was observed in 80-glutamine GFP-transfected cells (Fig. 2). Almost no aggregation was ever detected in 19-glutamine GFP-transfected cells under basal conditions or following heat shock, except for a slight transitory elevation observed 3 h following the most severe heat shock (120 min) (Fig. 2). While no significant elevations in aggregates were detected in 80-glutamine GFP within the first 3 h of either 60 or 120 min of heat shock, significant elevations in protein aggregates were detected 24 h post-heat shock (Fig. 2). In contrast to the rapidly forming and transitory aggregates, aggregates present at 24 h were apparently sustained, with aggregation levels remaining elevated for at least 48 h following heat shock (Fig. 2). Results using 56-glutamine GFP were similar to that observed for 80-glutamine GFP (data not shown). Less than 6% of cells exhibited nuclear aggregates 48 h following even the most severe heat shock (Fig. 2). To better elucidate the characteristics of aggregates formed following heat shock, we conducted electron microscopy and nondenaturing electrophoresis analysis. While most aggregates analyzed were less than 2 μm in diameter, some of the aggregates formed following heat shock achieved sizes of 4–6 μm (Fig. 3). In most cases aggregates exhibited an irregular shape and appeared to have at least some fibrillar component. Analysis of aggregation using nondenaturing electrophoresis revealed the presence of a nonmigrating aggregate species in 80-glutamine GFP-transfected cells following heat shock (Fig. 3). This nonmigrating aggregate species appears highly stable, based on the inability of SDS and heat treatment to disrupt aggregate (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained using 56-glutamine GFP-transfected cells (data not shown). Under no circumstances, during basal conditions or following heat shock, was a nonmigrating aggregate species detected in 19-glutamine GFP-transfected cells (data not shown). Because no obvious increase in the level of GFP (summing of aggregated and nonaggregating species) is observed, these data suggest that increased aggregation of GFP following heat shock is likely not due to a gross elevation in the level of GFP protein. The ability of aggregates to persist up to 48 h following heat shock suggested that cells may still be viable following heat shock. To elucidate whether heat shock induces neural cell death, we conducted cell survival analysis following the most severe heat shock conditions utilized in the present study (120-min heat shock). No significant elevation in cell death was observed between 19-glutamine GFP and 80-glutamine GFP-transfected cells, even up to 72 h following heat shock (Fig. 4). Previous studies have suggested that polyglutamine expansion may impair the proteasome proteolytic pathway (13.Cummings C.J. Mancini M.A. Antalffy B. DeFranco D.B. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 14.Waelter S. Boeddrich A. Lurz R. Scherzinger E. Lueder G. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1393-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 15.Wyttenbach A. Carmichael J. Swartz J. Furlong R.A. Narain Y. Rankin J. Rubinsztein D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2898-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We analyzed proteasome proteolytic activity in 19-glutamine and 80-glutamine GFP-transfected cells under basal conditions. Under normal growth conditions there was no significant impairment in either chymotrypsin-like or postglutamyl peptidase activities of the proteasome (Fig. 5). Following heat shock there was observed to be a significant elevation in chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity in 19-glutamine GFP-expressing cells, which was significantly blunted in 80-glutamine GFP-expressing cells (Fig. 5). Interestingly, no significant elevations in post-glutamyl peptidase activity was evident following heat shock (Fig. 5). Results using 56-glutamine GFP were similar to 80-glutamine GFP (data not shown). Because previous studies have suggested that impairments in proteasome activity may contribute to aggregate formation in polyglutamine disorders, we next sought to determine the effects of proteasome inhibition on protein aggregation. Application of low, nontoxic concentrations of the proteasome inhibitor MG-115, induced a slight time-dependent increase in GFP aggregation in 80-glutamine GFP-transfected cells, but not 19-glutamine GFP-expressing cells (Fig. 6). Increased levels of aggregation were evident within 3 h following administration of proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 6). Application of toxic concentrations of proteasome inhibitors induced higher levels of aggregate formation at 24 h (Fig. 6). Similar results were obtained with the proteasome inhibitor epoxomycin (data not shown). Because the response of 56-glutamine and 80-glutamine GFP to heat shock and proteasome inhibitors was so different from 19-glutamine GFP-transfected cells, we next sought to determine whether these observations could be due in part to altered levels of heat shock proteins (Hsp) or proteasome subunits. No significant difference in Hsp70 expression was evident between 19-glutamine, 56-glutamine, and 80-glutamine GFP-transfected cells under basal conditions or following heat shock (Fig. 7). In contrast to Hsp70, Northern blot analysis revealed that 80-glutamine GFP had higher basal levels of Hsp40 than 19-glutamine GFP (Fig. 7). Interestingly, while 19-glutamine GFP-transfected cells exhibited increased Hsp40 expression following 120-min heat shock, 80-glutamine GFP exhibited no elevation in Hsp40 expression (Fig. 7). No difference in the expression of the C2 α-subunit of the 20 S proteasome was evident between 19-glutamine, 56-glutamine, or 80-glutamine GFP-transfected cells under basal conditions or following heat shock (Fig. 7). In contrast to expression of C2, cells expressing 56-glutamine and 80-glutamine GFP exhibited increased expression of the LMP2 β-subunit of the 20 S proteasome, as compared with 19-glutamine GFP-transfected cells (Fig. 7). Increased LMP2 expression in 56-glutamine and 80-glutamine GFP-transfected cells was evident under basal conditions as well as following heat shock. In the present study we utilized neural SH-SY5Y cells that have been stably transfected with polyglutamine expansion constructs, to analyze aggregate formation and its effect on the proteasomal proteolytic pathway. Previous studies have demonstrated that neural cell lines stably transfected to express polyglutamine expansion can be established (42.Li S.H. Cheng A.L. Li H. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5159-5172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to transient transfection or inducible polyglutamine expression (8.Moulder K.L. Onodera O. Burke J.R. Strittmatter W.J. Johnson E.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 705-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Saudou, F., Finkbeiner, S., Devys, D., and Greenberg, M. E.Cell 95, 55–66Google Scholar, 34.Kim M. Lee H.S. LaForet G. McIntyre C. Martin E.J. Chang P. Kim T.W. Williams M. Reddy P.H. Tagle D. Boyce F.M. Won L. Heller A. Aronin N. DiFiglia M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 964-973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cells in the present study do not undergo a rapid form of cell death under basal conditions and thus have likely undergone genetic or biochemical changes, which allow them to cope with polyglutamine expansion. It is interesting to note that no known embryonic defects occur in humans or mice expressing mutant huntingtin (1.Orr H.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 2.Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 3.Paulson H.L. Brain Pathol. 2000; 10: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), while additional studies have demonstrated that mutant huntingtin is capable of suppressing embryonic lethality in huntingtin knock-out mice (1.Orr H.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 2.Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 3.Paulson H.L. Brain Pathol. 2000; 10: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), consistent with the ability of neuronal cells to withstand the existence of polyglutamine expansion for prolonged periods without apparent adverse effects. However, it is also important to note that cells stably expressing polyglutamine expansion have been demonstrated to be more vulnerable to stress (43.Zeron M.M. Chen N. Moshaver A. Lee A.T. Wellington C.L. Hayden M.R. Raymond L.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and were more prone to aggregate formation in the present study. Data from the present study demonstrate that heat shock can induce an apparently reversible form of aggregate formation in cells expressing polyglutamine expansion. Cells expressing longer polyglutamine stretches (56-glutamine and 80-glutamine GFP) underwent apparently reversible increases in visible aggregate formation following very mild stress (5-min heat shock), while cells with 19-glutamine GFP underwent slight elevations in visible protein aggregation following the most severe stress (120 min heat shock), with aggregation in both paradigms being apparently reversible. It is likely that these rapidly forming visible aggregates are caused by heat shock-induced protein denaturing and protein misfolding, which increase the levels of nonspecific protein-protein interactions (39.Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that heat shock induced aggregation in GFP-expressing cells is due to intrinsic protein instabilities within the GFP protein, based on the fact that the majority of GFP remained functional, with GFP fluorescence detected throughout 19-glutamine, 56-glutamine, and 80-glutamine GFP-expressing cells following even the most severe heat shock (Fig. 1). Our data suggest that 19-glutamine GFP may be less promiscuous in forming nonspecific interactions than either 56-glutamine or 80-glutamine GFP, consistent with previous reports demonstrating the existence of a polyglutamine length-dependent propensity for protein binding (1.Orr H.T.

In future studies it will be important to determine via immunohistochemical analysis exactly what proteins are present within heat shock-induced aggregates. It is interesting to note that the reversible mode of visible aggregate formation occurs more rapidly (<3 h) than the formation of stable visible aggregates (which are not evident until 24 h post-heat shock). These data raise the possibility that different processes may be involved in the formation of visible aggregates which are reversible, as compared with those that are stable. For example, the formation of visible aggregates that are stable may require protein synthesis or a heterogeneous mixture of proteins to form and thereby is more dependent on time than reversible aggregate formation, which may form as the result of more spontaneous protein-protein interactions. However, it is important to point out that the apparent reversibility in visible aggregate formation may not necessarily reflect an actual decrease in aggregates, but may simply indicate that the type of aggregate created has been altered in some way. For example, analysis of aggregate formation using nondenaturing electrophoresis revealed that an SDS and heat-insoluble aggregate species is present (Fig. 3D) when no visible aggregates are detectable (Fig. 2B). In the present study, cells remained viable following the formation of aggregates. In most cases multiple aggregates were present in individual cells, and in some cases even large aggregates (4–6 μm) were observed, without an apparent induction of cytotoxicity. These data indicate that the presence of intracellular aggregates, and even large intracellular aggregates, do not necessarily serve as an indicator of cytotoxicity, consistent with previous reports (1.Orr H.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 2.Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 3.Paulson H.L.

Very few of the cells in the present study demonstrated nuclear aggregates (Fig. 2E), possibly indicating that aggregation within the nucleus may be particularly important in the initiation of cytotoxicity. Although no increase in cell death was observed following heat shock, data in the present study do not rule out the possibility that cells may have compromised viability. It will be important in future studies to determine whether protein aggregation in this paradigm alters gene expression or signal transduction pathways that may be important in the neurotoxicity observed in polyglutamine disorders. To survive in response to genetic and environmental stressors, cells rely on the function Hsp family members, which function in a coordinated manner to aid in protein degradation, protein folding, and protein trafficking. Previous studies have demonstrated that increased levels of Hsp family members can attenuate polyglutamine toxicity (1.Orr H.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 2.Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 3.Paulson H.L. Brain Pathol. 2000; 10: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting that alterations in the expression of Hsp family members may play a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis in our cells stably transfected with polyglutamine expression. In the present study no differences in the expression levels of Hsp70 were evident by Northern blot analysis, or Western blot analysis (data not shown), between the 19-glutamine, 56-glutamine, and 80-glutamine GFP-transfected cells (Fig. 7). However, 19-glutamine GFP-expressing cells demonstrated an enhanced up-regulation of Hsp40 following heat shock than 80-glutamine GFP-transfected cells (Fig. 7). It is interesting to note that 19-glutamine, 56-glutamine, and 80-glutamine GFP all had higher levels of Hsp expression than wild-type SH-SY5Y cells (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that the presence of polyglutamine expansion may have a direct effect on the intracellular Hsp pathway and affect Hsp function in such a manner that is potentially of direct importance to polyglutamine neuropathology. For example, the presence of polyglutamine expansion alone may place such a burden on the Hsp pathway that cells are ultimately unable to up-regulate the Hsp pathway further in response to subsequent stressors. A dramatic finding in the present study is the increased expression of the LMP2 β-subunit of the 20 S proteasome (Fig. 7), which is one of the proteasome subunits responsible for proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity (16.Ding Q. Keller J.N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 574-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), in 56-glutamine and 80-glutamine GFP-transfected cells. No alteration in the C2 α-subunit of the 20 S proteasome was observed between 19-glutamine, 56-glutamine, or 80-glutamine GFP-transfected cells in the present study (Fig. 7). These data are consistent with recent reports and strongly suggest that cells can undergo specific alterations in proteasome subunit expression in response to polyglutamine expansion. For example, recent studies have demonstrated polyglutamine expansion can up-regulate specific components of the lysosomal proteolytic pathway (44.Kegel K.B. Kim M. Sapp E. McIntyre C. Castano J.G. Aronin N. DiFiglia M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7268-7278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alterations in proteasome subunits expression are likely responsible for mediating the ability of the proteasome to exhibit normal levels of activity, even in the presence of polyglutamine expansion. Additionally, these data indicate that LMP2 may be a particularly important proteasome subunit in conditions where protein aggregation occurs. Because there are over 20 individual genes encoding for the subunits for the core 20 S proteasome, and an additional 30+ genes encoding for subunits of the 19 S and 11 S caps of the 20 S proteasome (16.Ding Q. Keller J.N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 574-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), these data highlight the importance of elucidating the specific effects of polyglutamine expansion on proteasome subunit expression. Such basic information is critical for the understanding of how alterations in proteasome biology contribute to polyglutamine neurotoxicity. The greatest effect of polyglutamine expansion on proteasome activity was not on basal proteasome activity, but on the activity of the proteasome following stress. Following heat shock, cells expressing longer lengths of polyglutamine expansion (80-glutamine GFP) were unable to increase proteasome activity as well as 19-glutamine GFP-transfected cells (Fig. 5). These data suggest that the deleterious effect of polyglutamine expansion on the proteasome-proteolytic pathway may ultimately be on its ability to suppress elevations in proteasome activity in response to stress and not because of the impairment of basal levels of proteasome activity per se. Additionally, polyglutamine expansion may have important effects on proteasome localization. For example, only 10–15% of proteasome activity in the brain is nuclear (16.Ding Q. Keller J.N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 574-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar); therefore small changes in the localization or function of the proteasome in the nucleus may have profound effects on cellular homeostasis. It is likely that proteasome activity is up-regulated in response to the presence of increased levels of damaged and misfolded proteins following heat shock (39.Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). Consistent with such a paradigm, previous studies have demonstrated that proteasome activity can be rapidly elevated in reponse to mild oxidative stress (45.Reinheckel T. Ullrich O. Sitte N. Grune T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar,46.Grune T. Reinheckel T. Joshi M. Davies K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2344-2351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Application of proteasome inhibitors increased protein aggregation similar to heat shock, in that it occurred only in 80-glutamine GFP-expressing cells (Fig. 6). At least 20% proteasome inhibition was required for the formation of protein aggregates (data not shown), which was not overtly toxic with 24 h of application (Fig. 6D). It is important to note that application of proteasome inhibitors induces aggregates rapidly (∼ 3 h) (Fig. 6), as compared with heat shock (Fig. 2). Previous studies have utilized proteasome inhibitors to elucidate the role of the proteasome in degradation of various substrates, including GFP-and polyglutamine-containing proteins (14.Waelter S.

However, it is important to point out that proteasome inhibitors are highly toxic to many cells, including neurons and neural cell lines (22.Pasquini L.A. Besio Moreno M. Adamo A.M. Pasquini J.M.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 259-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that the effects of proteasome inhibition may ultimately be due to induction of cell death process and not proteasome inhibition per se. Previous studies have demonstrated a gross loss of proteasome activity in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ischemia-reperfusion injury (25.Keller J.N. Hanni K.B. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 26.Keller J.N. Huang F.F. Zhu H. Yu J. Ho Y.S. Kindy M.S. J. Cereb.

Data from the present study suggest that while basal levels of proteasome activity may only be slightly impaired in polyglutamine disorders, the ability of the proteasome to respond to stress may be significantly compromised. Such a compromise may contribute to protein aggregation and a loss of neuronal homeostasis. It is likely that developing a better understanding of the role of proteasome activity and aggregate formation in polyglutamine disorders may enhance our understanding of neurotoxicity in general and ultimately lead to the discovery of effective interventions.

Zyxin co-localizes with integrins at sites of cell-substratum adhesion and is postulated to serve as a docking site for the assembly of multimeric protein complexes involved in regulating cell motility. Recently, we identified a new member of the zyxin family called TRIP6. TRIP6 is localized at focal adhesions and overexpression of TRIP6 slows cell migration. In an effort to define the molecular mechanism by which TRIP6 affects cell migration, the yeast two-hybrid assay was employed to identify proteins that directly bind to TRIP6. This assay revealed that both TRIP6 and zyxin interact with CasL/HEF1, a member of the Cas family. This association is mediated by the LIM region of the zyxin family members and the SH2 domain-binding region of CasL/HEF1. Furthermore, the association between p130Cas and the two zyxin family members was demonstrated to occur in vivoby co-immunoprecipitation.

Upon binding to the substratum, integrins recruit many cytoskeletal components to the sites of cell adhesion and establish a structural link between the elements of the ECM and actin filaments. In addition to contributing to the physical link between the extracellular and intracellular environments, integrin engagement also regulates several signaling pathways (2Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E.

Zyxin, the founding member of the family, is a phosphoprotein that is localized at focal adhesions and along actin filaments (37Crawford A.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol.

Cell. 1994; 79: 211-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Thus far, two protein binding partners for the triplet LIM series in zyxin have been identified. The most NH2-terminal LIM domain (LIM1) of zyxin interacts with members of the cysteine-rich protein family that play important roles in muscle (40Sadler I. Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 51Arber S. Halder G. Caroni P. Cell. 1994; 79: 221-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). A second binding partner of the LIM domains, the serine/threonine kinase h-warts/LATS1, was recently reported to interact with LIM1–2 of zyxin during mitosis (52Hirota T. Morisaki T. Nishiyama Y. Marumoto T. Tada K. Hara T. Masuko N. Inagaki M. Hatakeyama K. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1073-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). H-wart/LATS1 is a component of mitotic apparatus and negatively regulates Cdc2 activity (52Hirota T. Morisaki T. Nishiyama Y. Marumoto T. Tada K. Hara T. Masuko N. Inagaki M. Hatakeyama K. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1073-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Evidence of an association between zyxin and a regulator of mitotic progression is consistent with the postulated role of zyxin in signaling. Moreover, although zyxin is found at focal adhesions and faintly in the leading edge, it also has the capacity to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (36Beckerle M.C. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 39Nix D.A. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that zyxin may relay information between these two compartments. Several years ago, a cDNA sequence that encoded two LIM domains with a high degree of similarity to those in zyxin was identified in a screen for proteins that interacted with the thyroid hormone receptor (53Lee J.W. Choi H.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the physiological significance of the interaction between the thyroid hormone receptor and TRIP6 (thyroid receptor interacting protein 6) has yet to be confirmed, we became interested in the protein because of its potential relationship to zyxin. Further characterization of TRIP6 revealed a similar domain structure to that of zyxin (54Yi J. Beckerle M.C. Genomics. 1998; 49: 314-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Additionally, the subcellular distribution of exogenous TRIP6 was comparable with zyxin (55Zhao M.K. Wang Y. Murphy K. Yi J. Beckerle M.C. Gilmore T.D. Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 207-217PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that TRIP6 is a member of the zyxin family. In an effort to learn more about the function of TRIP6 and its relationship to zyxin, we examined the subcellular distribution of endogenous TRIP6, studied the effect of TRIP6 overexpression on cell migration, and performed a two-hybrid screen to identify potential TRIP6-binding partners. Here we report that both TRIP6 and zyxin interact with p130Cas and CasL/HEF1, two members of the Cas family. Cas family members, p130Cas (56Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), CasL/HEF1 (human enhancer of filamentation 1 (57Law S.F. Estojak J. Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2331-2338PubMed Google Scholar, 60Alexandropoulos K. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1341-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar)), are adaptor proteins that play a role in cell motility. Co-expression of p130Cas and FAK in Chinese hamster ovary cells increases cell migration as compared with FAK expression alone (61Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Cell migration is also enhanced by co-expression of p130Cas and Crk (62Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). This Cas-Crk mediated stimulation of cell migration is blocked by expression of p130Cas lacking the Crk-binding site or by expression of Crk lacking a functional SH2 domain. Targeted gene disruption studies have also demonstrated that Cas is involved in the regulation of cell locomotion (63Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Ishikawa T. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 64Honda H. Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Hirai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The assembly of signaling complexes involving Cas family members has been shown to be crucial for normal cellular responses to integrin engagement (65O'Neill G.M. Fashena S.J. Golemis E.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 111-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The demonstration that zyxin and Cas family members are present in the same molecular complex provides a direct connection between zyxin family members and Cas-dependent motility. Anti-TRIP6 antibody was generated in New Zealand White rabbits against a peptide sequence deduced from TRIP6 cDNA sequence analysis (54Yi J. Beckerle M.C. Genomics. 1998; 49: 314-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence10KQPEPARAPQGRAIPR25 conjugated to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) was immunized three times by subcutaneous injections and subsequent intravenous injections at 4-week intervals. The anti-TRIP6 antiserum was affinity purified using the immunogen peptide linked to Sulfolink gel (Pierce) according to a method described elsewhere (66Harlow A. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 313-315Google Scholar). Briefly, the polyclonal antiserum diluted 1:10 in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, was passed through the column, washed extensively with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and the bound antibodies were eluted with 100 mmglycine, pH 2.5. Fractions were collected in tubes containing 1m Tris, pH 8. The antiserum was characterized by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled IMR-90 cell lysates prepared under denaturing conditions. IMR-90 cells were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (Tran35S-label; ICN Biochemicals Inc.) for immunoprecipitation under denaturing conditions. Metabolic labeling of cells was carried out as described elsewhere (67Pomies P. Louis H.A. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Metabolically labeled cells were washed three times with PBS, lysed in 250 μl of Laemmli sample buffer with protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mmbenzamidine, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml phenanthroline) and scraped from the dishes. Cell lysates were boiled for 5 min to denature the proteins and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Immunoprecipitation was carried out after dilution of the supernatants in 4 volumes of modified RIPA buffer without SDS (50 mmTris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with protease inhibitors. The lysates were precleared with protein A-agarose beads. The precleared lysates were then incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C with either 5 μl of anti-TRIP6 antiserum or 5 μl of corresponding preimmune serum and further incubated for 1 h with protein A-agarose beads. The beads were washed four times with modified RIPA buffer containing 0.2% SDS and boiled for 5 min in 2 × Laemmli sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates were resolved on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. For co-immunoprecipitation of interacting proteins from adherent cell lysates, IMR-90 cells grown on tissue culture dishes in DME supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum were washed two times with PBS and lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.02% SDS, 0.5 mmEDTA, protease inhibitors). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min and the soluble fractions were recovered for immunoprecipitation. Lysates from non-adherent cells were prepared as described elsewhere with a slight modification (68Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5501-5509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, adherent cells were detached by trypsinization and washed twice with DME containing 1% fetal bovine serum. Detached cells were held in suspension for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then collected by centrifugation, washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and then lysed in buffer A. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min and supernatants were collected for immunoprecipitation. The lysates were incubated with protein A-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C and precleared supernatants were collected after centrifugation. For the zyxin immunoprecipitation, precleared lysates containing 0.5 mg of protein were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 5 μl of zyxin-specific antisera or preimmune sera. For the TRIP6 immunoprecipitation, 1.0 mg of precleared lysates were similarly incubated with 40 μl of affinity-purified TRIP6 antibody or rabbit IgG as a negative control. Protein A-agarose beads were added to the mixture and incubated for an additional hour. The beads were washed four times with 1 ml of buffer A and the immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling the beads in 2 × Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min. The immunoprecipitates were resolved on 7.5 or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose paper for immunoblotting. Zyxin and p130Caswere detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection method using horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse immunoglobulins as a secondary reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The blots were then stripped in stripping solution (100 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8) for 1 h at 50 °C and washed three times in TBS, 0.1% Tween. After stripping, the blots were reprobed with anti-vinculin antibody (Sigma) and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (69Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1679-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on glass coverslips coated with 100 μg/ml fibronectin (Invitrogen) in DME supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Coverslips were washed in PBS, fixed for 15 min with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS, and permeabilized for 4 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. After washing in Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl), the coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies at 37 °C for 60 to 120 min, washed for 15 min in TBS, and subsequently incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies. The coverslips were mounted with gelvatol after washing for 15 min in TBS. Primary antibodies used in this study included the following: an affinity purified rabbit polyclonal anti-TRIP6 antibody B59, a rabbit polyclonal anti-zyxin antibody B38 (1:400), the anti-vinculin monoclonal antibody hVIN-1 (1:200; Sigma), monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (1:600; Sigma), and a rabbit polyclonal anti-β-galactosidase antibody (1:1000; Cappel). Secondary antibodies included fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-mouse IgG (1:250), fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; Cappel), and Texas Red-goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Molecular Probes). Cell images were visualized on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. The 5′ end of the human TRIP6 sequence was used to search the expressed sequence tag data base with the BLAST protocol. One highly homologous murine cDNA clone (W58878) was obtained from Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO) and sequenced in its entirety. A FLAG epitope was engineered on the amino terminus of TRIP6 and subsequently subcloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). The construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Mouse fibroblasts (10T1/2) were plated at 3.0 × 105 cells/60-mm dish ∼22 h prior to transfection. The cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of a reporter construct encoding β-galactosidase and 2 μg of empty expression vector or vector containing FLAG-TRIP6 cDNA. The transient transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE Plus (16 μl Plus reagent and 10 μl of LipofectAMINE, Invitrogen) and cells were allowed to incorporate cDNA constructs for 4 h. Forty h post-transfection, cells were prepared for the cell migration assay or harvested in 2 × Laemmli sample buffer to examine TRIP6 expression by Western analysis. A polyclonal TRIP6 antibody directed against the murine sequence (CKQPEPSRLPQGRSLPR) was utilized as the primary antibody. TRIP6 was visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection method. The relative amount of TRIP6 expression was quantified by using the Kodak Image Station 440 CF and Kodak Digital Science 1D 3.0.2 software. Transfection efficiency was ∼35% as measured by X-gal staining. Haptotaxis migration assays were performed as previously described (62Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell migration assays were executed using modified Boyden chambers (24-well cell culture inserts containing polyethylene terephthalate membranes, 8-μm pores). The underside of the membrane was coated overnight at 4 °C with bovine serum albumin or fibronectin (20 μg/ml). The inserts were rinsed one time with PBS and then placed into the lower chamber containing 750 μl of DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA, washed twice using serum-free DMEM, and resuspended to 5.0 × 105 cells/ml. Approximately 125,000 cells were added to the top of each migration chamber and allowed to migrate to the underside of the membrane for 6 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Nonmigratory cells on the upper surface of the membrane were mechanically removed with a cotton swab. Cells attached to the underside of the membrane were stained with X-gal substrate. Stained cells were photographed and counted (per field) with an inverted phase-contrast microscope using a ×10 objective. Background migration was determined by counting the number of β-galactosidase-expressing cells migrating on bovine serum albumin. These values were subtracted from the number of transfected cells migrating on fibronectin. Each determination represents the average of three individual wells and error bars represent the standard error of the mean. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae reporter strain L40 (MATa his3–200 trp1–901 leu2–3,112 ade2 lys2–801am URA3::(lexAop)8-lacZ LYS2::(lexAop)4-HIS3 (70Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar)) was used for screening and measurement of reporter gene expression. The yeast strain DY151 (also known as W303-1B, MATα ade2-1 can1–100 his3–11 leu2-3 trp1-1 ura3-1; (71Thomas B.J. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 56: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar)) was used in mating assays and to perform specificity test. The prey plasmid pVP16 and mouse embryo cDNA library cloned into pVP16 have been described elsewhere (70Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). pVP16 contains a selectable marker LEU2. The bait vector plasmid pBTM116/ADE2 that contains the ADE2 gene and a selectable marker TRP1 has been described elsewhere (72McCright B. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26123-26128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The bait plasmid pBTM116/ADE2-TRIP6LIM(1–2) was constructed by subcloning a PCR-amplified DNA sequence encoding the first and second LIM domains of TRIP6 (amino acid residues 276–393) intoEcoRI site of pBTM116/ADE2. Other bait constructs containing each individual LIM domain, LIM(1–2), LIM(2–3), and LIM(1–3) of human zyxin were constructed by subcloning into EcoRI site of pBTM116/ADE2. p130Cas DNA fragments (the full-length p130Cas cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. T. Parsons) encoding a part (amino acid residues 319–471) or all of the SH2 domain-binding substrate region (amino acid residues 212–525) of p130Cas were subcloned into the NotI site of pVP16 and BamHI site of pBTM116/ADE2. The yeast strain L40 was first transformed with pBTM116/ADE2-TRIP6LIM(1–2) and isolated on selective medium lacking tryptophan. The yeast strain was then transformed with mouse cDNA library by electroporation. An estimated 5 × 106 independent transformants were plated on medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, uracil, and histidine with 45 mm3-aminotriazole to select for cells that transactiv"
https://openalex.org/W2041714098,"Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic. To characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence. As a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures. After 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence. Temporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal). Levels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures. The induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype. pRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types. We find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence. Analysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells. These results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization."
https://openalex.org/W2075746219,"Conformational changes of bovine α-lactalbumin induced by adsorption on a hydrophobic interface are studied by fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Adsorption of bovine α-lactalbumin on hydrophobic polystyrene nanospheres induces a non-native state of the protein, which is characterized by preserved secondary structure, lost tertiary structure, and release of calcium. This partially denatured state therefore resembles a molten globule state, which is an intermediate in the folding of bovine α-lactalbumin. Stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy reveals two kinetic phases during adsorption with rate constants k1 ∼ 50 s−1 and k2 ∼ 8 s−1. The rate of partial unfolding is remarkably fast and even faster than unfolding induced by the addition of 5.4 mguanidinium hydrochloride to native α-lactalbumin. The large unfolding rates exclude the possibility that unfolding of bovine α-lactalbumin to the intermediate state occurs before adsorption takes place. Stopped-flow fluorescence anisotropy experiments show that adsorption of bovine α-lactalbumin on polystyrene nanospheres occurs within the dead time (15 ms) of the experiment. This shows that the kinetic processes as determined by stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy are not affected by diffusion or association processes but are solely caused by unfolding of bovine α-lactalbumin induced by adsorption on the polystyrene surface.

A scheme is presented that incorporates the results obtained and describes the adsorption of bovine α-lactalbumin. Adsorption of proteins on solid/liquid interfaces is a generally occurring phenomenon both in nature and in man-made systems. It is well recognized that proteins undergo conformational changes upon adsorption on solid/liquid interfaces (1.Haynes C.A. Norde W. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1995; 169: 313-328Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 2.Andrade J.D. Hlady V. Adv. Polym. Sci. 1986; 79: 1-63Crossref Google Scholar, 3.Baszkin A. Norde W. Physical Chemistry of Biological Interfaces. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York2000Google Scholar). Because unfolding of proteins can have a large effect on their function or properties, it is important to increase the knowledge about protein adsorption and about the resulting conformational changes. It is necessary to study not only the conformation of a protein in the adsorbed state but also the kinetics of the adsorption-induced conformational changes. This knowledge will help in controlling wanted or unwanted conformational changes of adsorbed proteins. In this work we focus on the kinetics of adsorption-induced conformational changes of bovine α-lactalbumin (BLA) 1The abbreviations used are: BLAbovine α-lactalbuminGdnHClguanidinium hydrochlorideMGmolten globuleCDcircular dichroismICP-OESinductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry 1The abbreviations used are: BLAbovine α-lactalbuminGdnHClguanidinium hydrochlorideMGmolten globuleCDcircular dichroismICP-OESinductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry upon interaction with colloidal polystyrene nanospheres. Detailed information on adsorption-induced conformational changes and especially on the kinetics of adsorption-induced conformational changes is sparse. An important reason for this is the experimental difficulty of the presence of an adsorbent, which is usually a solid phase. A few routes have been designed to remove this difficulty. A macroscopic solid/water interface can be used in combination with a reflective technique like ellipsometry or total internal reflection fluorescence (4.Wahlgren M.C. Arnebrant T. Paulsson M.A. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1993; 158: 46-53Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 5.van Wagenen R. Rockhold S. Andrade J. Cooper S.L. Peppas N.A. Biomaterials: Interfacial Phenomena and Applications. 199. American Chemical Society, Washington D.C.1982: 351-370Google Scholar). In other cases a microscopic system has been used that consists of small particles with diameters ranging from nanometers to micrometers in size (6.Maste M.C.L. Pap E.H.W. van Hoek A. Norde W. Visser A.J.W.G. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1996; 180: 632-633Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7.Norde W. Favier J.P. Colloids Surf. 1992; 64: 87-93Crossref Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The latter system has the advantage of providing a large interface, however, light scattering and light absorbance often interfere with several spectroscopic techniques. Here, we use a suspension of polystyrene nanospheres with a diameter of ∼50 nm. The large surface area per gram of polystyrene and therefore the high binding capacity allows a reduction of the nanosphere concentration. As a result, light scattering and absorption are reduced and thus the use of spectroscopic methods like stopped-flow fluorescence is feasible. bovine α-lactalbumin guanidinium hydrochloride molten globule circular dichroism inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry bovine α-lactalbumin guanidinium hydrochloride molten globule circular dichroism inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry Bovine α-lactalbumin is a small protein (14 kDa), containing four tryptophan residues and four disulfide bonds. It can bind calcium, which plays an important role in the stability and folding behavior of the protein (8.Troullier A. Reinstadler D. Dupont Y. Naumann D. Forge V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). BLA is chosen in this study for several reasons. First, the structure, stability, and folding behavior of BLA have been thoroughly studied (9.Chrysina E.D. Brew K. Acharya K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37021-37029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 10.Greene L.H. Grobler J.A. Malinovskii V.A. Tian J. Acharya K.R. Brew K.

Second, BLA is a protein that is applied at solid/water interfaces, for example in food applications. Finally, the folding pathway of BLA includes a stable intermediate, the so-called molten globule state, which has been studied in detail previously (12.Vanderheeren G. Hanssens I. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1194-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) emerged that describe the kinetics of conformational changes induced by adsorption on an interface or interaction with lipid vesicles. Unfortunately, still little is known about the altered conformation in the adsorbed state and about the kinetics of the conformational changes that take place upon adsorption. Further knowledge on these matters is of particular relevance for the understanding of protein-membrane interactions and in the field of synthetic biomaterials used for medical applications. Regarding protein-membrane interactions, it is hypothesized that, when proteins are translocated across the membrane, they must be in a non-native or molten globule (MG) state (21.Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work has indicated that, upon interaction with model membranes, BLA indeed can adopt an MG state (17.Banuelos S. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29910-29915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, the interaction of proteins with model membranes can occur via two mechanisms: (a) adsorption on the membrane interface and (b) combined adsorption and insertion/penetration into the membrane bilayer (22.Hanssens I. Houthuys C. Herreman W. van Cauwelaert F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 602: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the study presented here, BLA is adsorbed on a solid interface, so insertion or penetration cannot occur. The results show that adsorption itself suffices to cause a conformational change of BLA to an adsorbed state with molten globule properties. Although the polystyrene nanospheres used are not a biological system, they are, at the moment, the only solid/liquid interface system that allows the study of the effect of adsorption (excluding penetration) on protein conformation with kinetic spectroscopic methods. We believe that the results obtained widen the biological view of protein-membrane interactions. Furthermore, our study is relevant in the field of synthetic biomaterials. Synthetic polymer biomaterials are used in medical applications, for example as implants in the human body. Contact between these biomaterials and tissue or blood gives rise to all kinds of complex and mostly unwanted phenomena. Upon implantation of foreign material in the human body, proteins adsorb on the biomaterial. Knowledge of this process is relevant in the search for new and better biomaterials that can reduce adverse reactions of the human body. In this report, the adsorption-induced unfolding of bovine α-lactalbumin (BLA) is studied by intrinsic fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Both the nature and the kinetics of conformational changes of BLA upon adsorption on a polystyrene/water interface are characterized. Several theoretical models exist that describe the kinetics of adsorption as well as the kinetics of adsorption-induced conformational changes (2.Andrade J.D. Hlady V. Adv. Polym. Sci. 1986; 79: 1-63Crossref Google Scholar). The experimental difficulty of discriminating between both kinetic processes has hampered the experimental verification of these models. Here we show that the kinetics of adsorption and the kinetics of adsorption-induced conformational changes can be distinguished. In fact, it is demonstrated that the kinetics of both the diffusion and the adsorption processes do not need to be taken into account to enable analysis of the kinetics of the conformational change of the adsorbed protein as observed in stopped-flow experiments. Bovine α-lactalbumin (l-5385, Sigma Chemical Co.) was used without further purification. Polystyrene nanospheres, supplied as a colloidal suspension in water, were obtained from Polymer Laboratories (Heerlen, The Netherlands). Nanosphere suspensions were diluted with buffer before use. All experiments were done in a 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer of pH 7.50 containing 1 mmCaCl2. The added calcium ensures a constant calcium concentration during the adsorption and unfolding experiments, because calcium has a drastic effect on the stability and folding behavior of BLA. Nanopure water was used in all experiments (Sybron Barnstead NANOpure II). Dynamic light scattering was performed on an experimental setup composed of a Lexal 150-milliwatt laser operating at a wavelength of 514.5 nm, a photomultiplier, and a personal computer containing an ALV5000 correlation card. Scattered intensities were recorded at a 90° scattering angle and at 20 °C. A total of 10 measurements of each 10 s were averaged. The data were analyzed by the ALV5000 software. Samples were diluted in the buffer mentioned above. The nanosphere concentration ranged from 0.05 to 0.25 mg/ml. The electrophoretic mobility of the polystyrene nanospheres (3 mg/ml) suspended in a 10 mmTris/HCl buffer at pH 7.5 with 1 mm CaCl2 was determined by microelectrophoresis (Malvern Zetasizer III). The Malvern computer program was used to calculate the zeta-potential from the electrophoretic mobility. The adsorption isotherm was determined according to the depletion method. The amount of free protein after adsorption was measured spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient of 28,540 m−1 cm−1for BLA at 280 nm. The polystyrene nanospheres were separated from free α-lactalbumin by using Centricon 100 ultrafiltration devices (Millipore Corp.). Protein adsorption on the filter was checked and found to be negligible. The filter retained more than 99.8% of the polystyrene nanospheres. In a typical adsorption experiment 2.5 ml of protein solution was added to 2.5 ml of nanosphere suspension in a 10-ml polysulfone centrifuge tube (Nalgene, Oak Ridge, TN). The tubes were then placed on a rocking table and gently shaken at room temperature. Adsorption isotherms were determined after 30 min of adsorption and after 24 h of adsorption. Different protein concentrations were used to construct an adsorption isotherm. The resulting adsorption isotherm was used to determine the molar protein-to-nanosphere ratio (n) that gave maximal protein monolayer adsorption and minimal free protein. This ratio was used in all adsorption experiments, unless mentioned otherwise. For determination of the desorbed amount of BLA, the nanospheres covered with BLA where separated from the solution with Centricon 100 ultrafiltration devices. Separation was done at 4 °C without calcium or at 20 °C and in the presence of either 10 or 100 mmCaCl2. Subsequently the concentration of BLA in solution was determined spectrophotometrically. Polystyrene nanospheres (80 nm) were incubated with different amounts of CaCl2 (0, 5, 10, 40, 100, 200, and 400 μm) for 20 h at room temperature in a calcium-free 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer at pH 7.5. The nanospheres covered with calcium were separated from the calcium containing solution by ultrafiltration (Amicon, YM50 membrane, Millipore Corp.). The filtrate was analyzed for calcium content by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The amount of adsorbed calcium was calculated from the original amount and the amount of free calcium after filtration. An adsorption isotherm was constructed and fitted with a Langmuir isotherm: [Ca]adsorbed = (B*[Ca]free)/(Kd + [Ca]free). In this equation, B is the plateau value of adsorption, and Kd is the dissociation constant. The concentration of CaCl2 stock solutions was determined with ICP-OES. Fluorescence spectra and time-dependent fluorescence traces were measured in a quartz cuvette (10 × 4 mm) on a Fluorolog 2 (SPEX). The temperature of the cuvette holder was maintained at 20 °C with a water bath in all experiments. Excitation was at 300 nm, with excitation slits at 3 nm and emission slits at 5 nm. A blank, containing all components except protein, was subtracted from each sample. Nanosphere concentrations ranged up to 0.05 mg/ml. The total absorbance of the samples at 300 nm was kept below 0.1 to minimize the inner filter effect. To ensure a molar protein to nanosphere ratio of 500, the maximum protein concentration was about 0.5 μm. In the manual mixing adsorption experiments the nanospheres were added to the stirred protein solution with an automatic pipette. Typically, an amount of 100 μl of nanosphere suspension was added to 1.5 ml of protein solution. In time-dependent fluorescence measurements, care was taken to avoid photobleaching of the fluorophore, by ensuring discontinuous illumination with enough (dark) time between data points. Fluorescence anisotropy was measured on a home-built fluorometer equipped with two photomultipliers arranged in T-format (Thorn EMI 9863QA/350, operating in photon-counting detection mode). The light was generated by a 150-watt short arc xenon lamp, and the excitation wavelength of 300 nm was selected in a monochromator (Bausch and Lomb) with a bandpass of 3.2 nm. Polarizers were used in both the excitation light path (rotatable Glan Taylor polarizer) and the emission light path (Polaroid, sheet). The emission light was selected with a 335-nm cut off filter and a UG1 filter (Schott). A blank measurement, containing all components except BLA, was subtracted from each sample, and five measurements were averaged for each sample. Stopped-flow fluorescence and stopped-flow fluorescence anisotropy were measured on a BioLogic SFM4 equipped with a 2- × 2-mm cuvette (FC-20). Excitation was at 300 nm, and excitation slits were set at 0.5 mm, resulting in a bandpass of 4 nm. A cut-off filter of 335 nm (335FG01–25, Andover Corp.) and a 330wb60 bandpass filter (XF3000–25, Omega Optical Inc.) were used together to select the emission light. The temperature was kept constant at 20 °C with a thermostatic water bath. Ten measurements were averaged for each sample. In a typical run 150 μl of a 5 μm protein solution was mixed with 150 μl of a 10 nm nanosphere suspension in 75 ms. A flow speed of 4 ml/s resulted in a dead time of 15 ms. Faster flow speeds were not used, because this resulted in signal distortion and bad reproducibility, probably due to cavitation. Results from the stopped-flow fluorescence experiments were analyzed and fitted with the Padé-Laplace algorithm in the Bio-Kine software (Bio-Logic), using a minimum number of exponential phases. Prior to fitting the data, the signal of the polystyrene nanospheres was subtracted from the sample, and the time axis was adjusted, resulting in a shift of the first data point to t = 0 s. A fit was evaluated and judged to be correct when random noise around a horizontal line centered at zero was observed for the residual values. Stopped-flow fluorescence anisotropy was measured with a single photomultiplier and no polarizer in the emission light path. A similar set up has been reported recently in a study on protein folding in solution (23.Canet D. Doering K. Dobson C.M. Dupont Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1996-2003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the anisotropy set-up the excitation light is modulated with a photoelastic modulator to give alternating horizontally and vertically polarized light with a frequency of 100 kHz. The synchronized electronics connected to the photomultiplier simultaneously record the fluorescence emission intensity at vertical excitation (Iv) and at horizontal excitation (Ih). A blank, containing all components except BLA, was subtracted from the sample resulting in the corrected values Iv* and Ih*. The anisotropy (A) for each data point was then calculated in a spreadsheet application according to the equation: A = (Iv* − Ih*)/(Iv* + Ih*/2). CD measurements were performed on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter, equipped with a Peltier temperature control system set at 20 °C. Calibration was performed with an ammonium d-10-camphorsulfonate solution in nanopure water for which the concentration was checked spectrophotometrically. Typical protein concentrations used were 1.5 μm in a 0.1-cm cuvette for far-UV CD and 4.5 μm in a 1-cm cuvette for near-UV CD measurements. Eight scans were averaged for each sample. The CD spectra of BLA adsorbed on the nanospheres were averaged from 160 and 128 scans for the far-UV region and near-UV region, respectively. In the case of adsorbed BLA, sample and blank spectra were recorded alternately in sets of 32 scans, to avoid disturbances due to instrumental drift. For each set of 32 scans, a fresh sample of BLA adsorbed on the nanospheres was used. The response time was 1 s, and the spectral bandwidth was 1.0 nm. Before analysis of the spectra, a blank, containing all components except BLA, was subtracted from the sample. The radius of the nanospheres diluted in a 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer at pH 7.50 with 1 mm CaCl2 is 47 ± 1 nm as determined by dynamic light scattering. Based on this value a surface area of 122 ± 3 m2/g is calculated. Investigation by transmission electron microscopy shows that the nanospheres are spherical and that possible irregularities at the surface are smaller than 2 nm in size (results not shown). The zeta-potential for the nanospheres as determined by electrophoretic mobility is −38 ± 1 mV in a 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer with 1 mmCaCl2 at pH 7.5. This value indicates a negative surface charge of the polystyrene nanospheres in this particular buffer. The diameter of the nanospheres after adsorption of a monolayer of BLA is 49 ± 1 nm and remains the same during 24 h. No aggregation of the nanospheres occurs after adsorption of BLA. The adsorption isotherm of BLA on polystyrene nanospheres is shown in Fig. 1. The plateau value of 3 ± 0.2 mg/m2 agrees well with previously reported values. Adsorption of BLA on a platinum surface resulted in a value of 2.9 mg/m2 (24.Cabilio N.R. Omanovic S. Roscoe S.G. Langmuir. 2000; 16: 8480-8488Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and a value of 3.3 mg/m2 was found for adsorption of BLA on a hydrophobic silicon surface (25.Suttiprasit P. Krisdhasima V. McGuire J. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1992; 154: 316-326Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The steep part in the region of low BLA concentration is an indication for high affinity behavior. In the initial, steep part of the adsorption isotherm, all protein present in the system is adsorbed on the surface of the polystyrene nanospheres and virtually no free BLA is present in solution. If a molar nanosphere-to-protein ratio of 1:500 is chosen, then all BLA added is adsorbed and there is no free BLA present in the solution. This ratio corresponds with the region in the adsorption isotherm of the initial steep part, before a coverage of 3 mg/m2 is reached. This ratio is used in the adsorption experiments presented below, assuming that all added protein is adsorbed on the nanospheres. The polystyrene nanospheres and the BLA molecules both have a net negative charge under the conditions used. The fact that adsorption occurs means that the electrostatic repulsion has to be overcome. Hydrophobic interactions therefore contribute the most to the adsorption process, as was found for the adsorption of BLA on hydrophobic interfaces (15.Haynes C.A. Sliwinsky E. Norde W. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1994; 164: 394-409Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 26.Larsericsdotter H. Oscarsson S. Buijs J. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 2001; 237: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, minor contributions of electrostatic interactions cannot be excluded. They may play a role in the orientation of the adsorbed BLA molecules (see “Discussion”). Desorption of BLA from the polystyrene nanospheres is tested with different methods. Washing the BLA-covered nanospheres with buffer does not result in protein desorption, even after 24 h. Hardly any desorption of BLA from the polystyrene nanospheres takes place when the calcium concentration is increased. Only 12% of the adsorbed BLA molecules is desorbed when the calcium concentration is increased to 10 mm, whereas only 14% is desorbed at a calcium concentration of 100 mm after 24 h of incubation. In an attempt to decrease the hydrophobic interactions and enable BLA desorption the temperature was decreased. However, storage during 24 h at 4 °C and in the presence of 1 mmCaCl2 gave no desorption of BLA molecules. Fluorescence spectra of BLA in solution and of BLA adsorbed on nanospheres after 5 and 75 min of adsorption are shown in Fig. 2. The spectrum of BLA in solution shows a fluorescence emission maximum at 325 nm, which indicates that the Trp residues are buried in the hydrophobic interior of the protein. The adsorbed BLA shows a maximum at 335 nm and an intensity increase at maximum wavelength of about 100% compared with the spectrum of BLA in solution. The shift of the fluorescence maximum indicates that the tryptophan residues of BLA in the adsorbed state are in a more exposed environment. The intensity increase is related to a reduction in quenching that results from a different position of the tryptophan residues compared with their original position in the three-dimensional structure of native BLA. For native BLA it is suggested that energy transfer occurs from Trp26 and Trp104 to Trp60 and, furthermore, the fluorescence is quenched by two disulfide bonds near Trp60(Cys73-Cys91 and Cys61-Cys77) (27.Arai M. Kuwajima K. Fold. Des. 1996; 1: 275-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It has also been observed that unfolding of BLA results in a red shift of the fluorescence emission maximum and an accompanied increase in fluorescence intensity (28.Ostrovsky A.V. Kalinichenko L.P. Emelyanenko V.I. Klimanov A.V. Permyakov E.A. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 30: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Complete unfolding of α-lactalbumin by 5.4 mguanidinium hydrochloride results in a fluorescence emission maximum of 350 nm indicating complete exposure of the Trp residues (results not shown). A measured fluorescence emission maximum of 335 nm would thus indicate that the adsorption-induced unfolding is not complete, leaving one or more Trp residues in the hydrophobic core of BLA. Circular dichroism spectra of free and of adsorbed BLA in the far-UV region and in the near-UV region are shown in Figs.3 (A and B, respectively). The far-UV CD spectrum of adsorbed BLA shows that a considerable amount of secondary structure remains after adsorption. Although the spectrum of adsorbed BLA contains a lot of noise, the characteristic ellipticity minimum at 208 nm is visible. This indicates that the secondary structure of native BLA and of adsorbed BLA is similar. The near-UV CD spectra show a clear difference between native BLA and adsorbed BLA. The spectrum of BLA in solution has a characteristic profile that includes a broad Tyr minimum around 270 nm and a local Trp minimum at 297 nm. The spectrum of adsorbed BLA does not show these characteristics and has a decreased molar ellipticity over the entire near-UV CD spectrum, which indicates disruption of tertiary structure elements. The latter is in agreement with the changes seen in the fluorescence emission spectrum upon protein adsorption (see above). The difficulty of working with polystyrene nanospheres in suspensions emerges in particular when working with far-UV light in CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3A). The CD measurements in the far-UV region were performed with a nanosphere concentration that results in a UV absorption of 0.5 at 220 nm in a 0.1-cm light path cuvette, whereas in the near-UV a concentration of nanospheres is used, which results in a UV absorption of 0.5 at 280 nm in a 1-cm light path cuvette. The protein concentration was adjusted to obtain a ratio of 500 protein molecules to 1 nanosphere particle, as is used throughout this work. The loss of light intensity in the CD measurements of the adsorbed protein, which is due to both light scattering of the polystyrene nanospheres and light absorption of the polystyrene molecules in the nanospheres, leaves only half of the original intensity for the characterization of the protein structure. Consequently, a significant increase of noise in the data is observed. Despite the difference in the noise level between the spectra shown in Fig. 3, it is clear that upon BLA adsorption a disruption of tertiary structure elements occurs without significant loss of secondary structure. Stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy is used to investigate the kinetics of the adsorption process. To our knowledge, we demonstrate here for the first time protein adsorption on solid spheres in the stopped-flow technique. The small size of the nanospheres allows the use of this technique, without the risk of blocking the small mixing channels in a stopped-flow apparatus. A typical example of a stopped-flow trace is shown in Fig. 4. The experiments are performed with different BLA/nanosphere ratios ranging from about 1100 to 160 BLA molecules for each nanosphere. This ratio covers the steep part of the adsorption isotherm as desc"

Here, we tested whether chemokine receptor internalization could account for cell type differences in the effectiveness of chemokines. Infection of CEM T cells expressing stably transduced wild-type CCR5 was much more readily inhibited by chemokine than were transduced HOS cells. This response correlated with the efficiency of CCR5 internalization. A mutated CCR5, termed M7-CCR5, in which the Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic tail were changed to Ala, did not internalize in response to MIP-1α. M7-CCR5 was expressed at slightly higher levels than wild-type on stably transduced cell lines and was somewhat more potent as an HIV-1 coreceptor. The mutated receptor mobilized intracellular Ca2+ in response to chemokine to a level 4-fold higher than did the wild type CCR5. Unexpectedly, the receptor was desensitized as efficiently as wild type, suggesting that desensitization does not require cytoplasmic tail phosphorylation. Entry of R5 HIV-1 reporter virus into cells stably expressing M7-CCR5 was largely resistant to blocking by MIP-1α. As much as 80% of entry inhibition was attributed to receptor internalization. Aminooxypentane (AOP)-MIP-1α was able to induce a low level of M7-CCR5 internalization in HOS and to weakly inhibit HIV-1 entry.

The potency of these derivatives results from their ability to induce CCR5 internalization and to prevent the recycling of the endocytosed chemokine receptor to the cell surface (24.Mack M. Luckow B.

Antiviral Res. 1997; 35: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), are potent inhibitors of CCR5 and CXCR4 HIV-1 entry, respectively. For GPCRs in general, binding of ligand activates the coupled heterotrimeric G proteins, which mobilize intracellular second messengers such as inositol trisphosphates, cAMP, and intracellular [Ca2+] (29.Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Signaling is rapidly terminated as a result of receptor desensitization and internalization. These processes are mediated by cytoplasmic tail phosphorylation by a family of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and/or protein kinase C. The phosphorylated receptor then becomes a target for arrestin binding, which promotes dissociation of the G proteins and links the receptor to the endocytic machinery via adaptor proteins such as adaptor protein 2, leading to its association with clathrin-coated pits (29.Carman C.V.

Some cell types appear to be more susceptible to the blocking effects of chemokines than others. Infection of primary CD4+T-cells is generally inhibited by low concentrations of chemokine (<1 ng/ml), whereas macrophages are much less susceptible and require as much as 1 μg/ml of chemokine to prevent virus entry (20.Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Picard L. Offord R.E. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Buser R. Wells T.N.C. Proudfoot A.E. Science. 1997; 276: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 41.Dragic T. Litwin V.

At 100–500 ng/ml, RANTES completely protected peripheral blood leukocytes from infection with non-syncytium-inducing virus, yet macrophage infection was not blocked and in some cases was slightly enhanced (20.Simmons G.

Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. Nature. 1996; 382: 767Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The effectiveness of chemokines on macrophages is also influenced by their differentiation state (43.Amzazi S. Ylisastigui L. Bakri Y. Rabehi L. Gattegno L. Parmentier M. Gluckman J.C. Benjouad A. Virology. 1998; 252: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Monocyte-derived macrophages cultured without cytokines are 5 times less susceptible to HIV infection in the presence of RANTES than monocytes stimulated with macrophage colony-stimulating factor. This might be explained by the fact that monocytes are susceptible to modulation of CCR5 by chemokines (24.Mack M. Luckow B. Nelson P.J. Cihak J. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Signoret N. Marsh M. Stangassinger M. Borlat F. Wells T.N. Schlondorff D. Proudfoot A.E. J. Exp.

Virology. 2000; 278: 412-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested whether cell type differences in chemokine receptor internalization efficiency might account for the differential ability of chemokines to inhibit HIV infection. To investigate the mechanisms by which chemokines inhibit HIV-1 entry, we used an internalization-deficient mutant CCR5 termed M7-CCR5, in which seven cytoplasmic tail domain phosphorylation sites were changed to Ala. M7-CCR5 was deficient for chemokine-induced internalization, but its coreceptor activity was comparable with or slightly better than wild type. Importantly, entry was only slightly inhibited by chemokine. The ability of chemokines to block HIV entry could also be reduced by introducing a dominant negative dynamin into target cells, which interferes with receptor endocytosis. In addition, the susceptibility of two model cell lines to the inhibitory effects of chemokines correlated with the efficiency with which the receptor internalized in response to chemokine. Taken together, these findings suggest that internalization is a major mechanism by which chemokines prevent HIV infection and that the differential sensitivity of various cell types to the blocking effects of chemokines may be due to the efficiency with which they internalize CCR5 in response to ligand. M7-CCR5 (Ser336/Ser337/Tyr339/Thr340/Ser342/Thr343/Ser349) → Ala was generated by two rounds of PCR mutagenesis of a CCR5 cDNA (45.Deng D. Liu R. Ellmeier W. Choe S. Unutmaz D. Burkhart M.

The first round used the oligonucleotide primers 5′-CTC GGA TCC GGT GGA ACA AGA TGG ATT AT (5′ CCR5-BamHI) and 5′-TCA CAA GCC CAC AGC TAT TTC CTG CTC CCC AGC GGC TCG GGC GGC AAC TGC ACT GCT CG (C5M60). The second round used the oligonucleotides 5′-CCR5-BamHI and 5′-CCG TCG ACG AGT CCG TGT CAC AAG CCC ACA GCT AT (C5M34-SalI). Wild-type and M7-CCR5 cDNAs were fused in frame to EGFP in pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) by SalI andBamHI digestion after amplification with the oligonucleotides 5′-CTC GTC GAC GGT GGA ACA AGA TGG ATT AT (CCR5–1) and 5′-CTC GGA TCC GCC AAG CCC ACA GAT ATT TCC TG (CCR5–2).

The adherent human osteosarcoma cell line, HOS, and human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK-293T, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. Nonadherent cell lines derived from CEM.SS (CEM) were cultured in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum. Cultures were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. CCR5.EGFP and M7-CCR5.EGFP were stably transduced into HOS.CD4 (45.Deng D. Liu R. Ellmeier W. Choe S. Unutmaz D. Burkhart M. DiMarzio P. Marmon S. Sutton R.E. Hill C.M. Davis C.B. Peiper S.C.

Friedmann T. Yee J.K. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1202-1207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Retrovirus-containing supernatants were harvested 48 h post-transfection, filtered, and stored at −80 °C. Cells were infected with 1.0 ml of virus and selected 2 days later in medium containing 1 μg/ml or 0.5 μg/ml puromycin for HOS.CD4 or CEM, respectively. HOS.CD4 cell clones were isolated with glass cloning cylinders and expanded. For CEM, single cells were deposited using a FACStar® (Becton Dickinson; Franklin Lakes, NJ) into 96-well plates and expanded. Individual cell clones were evaluated for CCR5 cell surface expression by staining with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibody 2D7 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Single clones were chosen based upon CCR5 staining. MIP-1α (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA) and AOP-MIP-1α (a gift from G. Graham (Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Glasgow, United Kingdom)) were diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to 100 ng/μl stocks. TAK-779 was dissolved at 20 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide. Cells (5 × 105) in six-well plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with various concentrations of chemokine. Cells were harvested and stained in PBS, 1% fetal calf serum, 0.1% sodium azide for 30 min at 4 °C with 2D7-phycoerythrin. Cells were washed twice with PBS, 1% fetal calf serum, 0.1% sodium azide; fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde; and analyzed on a FACScan (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Falls, NJ). Cells were cultured overnight on 0.1% gelatin-treated glass coverslips in 24-well tissue culture dishes. Internalized chemokine receptor in cells was visualized by incubating them with chemokine for 4 h at 37 °C and then fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS. Cells were permeabilized with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, and nuclei were stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature. Coverslips were washed twice with PBS and mounted with Gel/Mount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA). Slides were photographed using SlideBook 2.1 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc., Denver, CO). To visualize the process of internalization in real time, cells were plated on fibronectin-treated 40-mm number 1.5 glass coverslips (Bioptechs, Butler, PA) in CO2-independent medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. The coverslips were mounted in a closed live cell micro-observation system (Bioptechs) kept at 37 °C connected to a microperfusion pump (Bioptechs) via Tygon high purity tubing (Bioptechs) used to administer agonist. The chamber was placed on an Olympus IX70 microscope and observed with a ×100 oil immersion objective equipped with an objective warmer. Images were deconvoluted using a Silicon Graphics O2 computer and Deltavision software. Cells were monitored for 30 min under initial chamber conditions to establish base-line conditions. The chamber was then infused with medium containing 200 ng/ml AOP-MIP-1α for 1 h. Images were recorded at a rate of one/min. The coverslip was then scanned to ensure that the final images were representative of the cells on the entire coverslip. Cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum for 30 min at 37 °C with 2 μm Indo-1 AM, 0.01% pluronic F-127 and were then exposed to 100 ng/ml MIP-1α. Fluorescence was monitored at 402 and 468 nm using a PTI bench top dual emission continuous spectrofluorimeter (Photon Technologies International, Inc., Lawrenceville, NJ). Intracellular [Ca2+] was calculated by the formula [Ca2+] = K d (F −F min)/(F max −F), where K d is the dissociation constant (250 nm) and F represents arbitrary fluorescent units. F min was considered as base-line fluorescence; F max was calculated as the fluorescence after stimulation with 1 μm ionomycin. HOS cells stably expressing CD4/CCR5.EGFP (2.0 × 106) were transfected with 20 μg of plasmid DNA by calcium phosphate transfection (50.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). The next morning, the cells were washed with medium and then harvested by trypsinization and plated in the afternoon for infection on the following day. Transfection efficiency was 60–75% in each experiment as measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of parallel transfections of HOS.CD4 with EGFP expression vector. Luciferase reporter viruses were produced by cotransfecting 293T cells with NL-Luc-E−R− (51.Connor R.I. Chen B.K. Choe S. Landau N.R.

Culture supernatants were harvested 48 h postinfection, filtered, and frozen at −80 °C in aliquots. Viruses were quantitated by p24gag enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Reporter assays were performed in triplicate with 1.0 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates. Cells were incubated with chemokine or TAK-779 for 30 min at 37 °C. JR.FL-pseudotyped NL-Luc-E−R− luciferase reporter virus (1 ng of p24) was added to a final volume of 100 μl and removed after a 4-h incubation at 37 °C. Luciferase activity was measured 3 days postinfection using the Luc-lite Plus reagent (Packard Bioscience Company). Light emission was quantitated using a Packard TopCount and expressed as counts per second (cps). Virus entry into primary T cells and T cell lines is effectively blocked by 1 ng/ml concentrations of inhibitory chemokines, whereas entry into 293 or HeLa cells transiently transfected with expression vectors for CD4/CCR5 was not detectably diminished by concentrations of MIP-1α, MIP-1β, or RANTES as high as 1 μg/ml (20.Simmons G.

Because CCR5 conformation is not known to be affected by cell type and because chemokine receptor internalization has been shown to play a role in mediating the effects of chemokines on HIV entry (23.Alkhatib G. Locati M. Kennedy P.E. Murphy P.M. Berger E.A. Virology. 1997; 234: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), we speculated that the efficiency of CCR5 internalization in response to ligand might be the cause of the observed cell type differences in susceptibility to inhibition of virus entry. To test this hypothesis, we used two model cell lines, an adherent cell line derived from a human osteosarcoma, HOS, and the transformed CD4+ T cell line, CEM. The HOS cells were stably transfected with a CD4 expression vector to generate HOS.CD4, and both cell lines were then stably transduced with a retroviral vector expressing CCR5 fused at its carboxyl terminus to EGFP. The EGFP did not interfere with coreceptor or chemokine receptor function, as shown below. To compare the efficiency of ligand-induced internalization by the HOS and CEM cell lines, the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with MIP-1α or the more potent AOP-MIP-1α at two different concentrations. The cells were analyzed for cell surface CCR5 by flow cytometry and for total cellular CCR5 by EGFP fluorescence. MIP-1α induced efficient internalization of CCR5 on CEM at 10 and 100 ng/ml. On the HOS cells, CCR5 was not affected by the lower concentration of chemokine, and at the higher concentration the receptor was reduced by only 25% (Fig. 1 A). AOP-MIP-1α, which is a potent inducer of CCR5 internalization (24.Mack M. Luckow B. Nelson P.J. Cihak J. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Signoret N. Marsh M. Stangassinger M. Borlat F. Wells T.N.

https://openalex.org/W2322609072,"Dlk/ZIP kinase is a serine/threonine kinase highly homologous to DAP kinase. We have reported that HeLa ZIP kinase (hZIPK) phosphorylated the regulatory light chain of myosin II (MRLC) at both Ser19 and Thr18 in vitro. In this study, we demonstrate that hZIPK also induces the diphosphorylation of MRLC in nonmuscle cells. Peptide mapping revealed that transient transfection of hZIPK into HeLa cells caused diphosphorylation of MRLC. In contrast, transfection of the kinase inactive mutant of hZIPK did not induce any phosphorylation of MRLC. Using antibodies specific for mono- or diphosphorylated MRLC, we showed that diphosphorylated MRLC induced by the overexpression of hZIPK was concentrated in striking aggregates or bundles of actin filaments in HeLa cells, while monophosphorylated MRLC showed no prominent localization to these aggregates. Overexpression of hZIPK also induced dramatic changes in cell shape and disruption of nuclear morphology reminiscent of changes during apoptosis. These effects of hZIPK were suppressed by the coexpression of a mutant MRLC where both phosphorylation sites were replaced with alanine, indicating that the changes in actin organization were a consequence of MRLC diphosphorylation. These results suggested that hZIPK plays a role in regulating actin organization and cell morphology in non-muscles and at least part of its effects are mediated through the diphosphorylation of MRLC."
https://openalex.org/W2040688097,"The development of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), which is characterized by a block of myeloid differentiation, is a multi-step process that involves several genetic abnormalities, but the molecular mechanisms by which these genetic alterations cooperate in leukemogenesis are poorly understood. The human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a model for multi-step leukemogenesis. BCR-ABL, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, is a fusion protein generated by the t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation found in the vast majority of CML patients. BCR-ABL efficiently induces a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) in mice, but progression to CML blast phase requires additional mutations. The AML1/MDS1/EVI1 (AME) transcription factor fusion protein, is a product of the human t(3;21)(q26;q22) translocation found as a secondary mutation in some cases of CML during the blast phase. We have previously shown that AME can induce an AML in mice but with a greatly extended latency, suggesting a requirement for additional mutations. Here we demonstrate that AME alone does not block myeloid differentiation in vivo during the 4-month pre-leukemia stage, yet co-expression of BCR-ABL and AME in mice can block myeloid differentiation and rapidly induce an AML. Our results suggest that block of myeloid differentiation and induction of AML involves cooperation between mutations that dysregulate protein tyrosine kinase signaling and those that disrupt hematopoietic gene transcription."

Cell surface biotinylated MPR and125I-labeled transferrin are accumulated in cellugyrin-positive vesicles and to a lesser extent in cellugyrin-negative vesicles. An average cellugyrin-positive vesicle carries not more than one molecule of either Glut4, insulin-responsive aminopeptidase (IRAP), or transferrin receptor (TfR), whereas cellugyrin-negative vesicles contain five to six molecules of Glut4, more than 10 molecules of IRAP, and still one molecule of TfR per vesicle. Cellugyrin-negative vesicles are translocated to the cell surface after insulin stimulation, whereas cellugyrin-positive vesicles maintain intracellular localization both in the absence and in the presence of insulin and, therefore, may be involved in interendosomal protein transport. Both cellugyrin-positive and cellugyrin-negative vesicles are present in extracts of non-homogenized cells and therefore may represent the major form of Glut4 storage in vivo. In rat adipose cells, intracellular Glut4 resides in two distinct vesicular populations one of which contains cellugyrin whereas another lacks this protein (Kupriyanova, T. A., and Kandror, K. V. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 36263–36268).

Pilch P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E1-E14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, insulin causes dramatic redistribution of glucose transporter isoform 4 (Glut4) and insulin-responsive aminopeptidase (IRAP)1/placental leucine aminopeptidase from intracellular compartment(s) to the plasma membrane. Recent studies have shown that in adipocytes, Glut4 and IRAP are not targeted to the regulated secretory pathway (2Bogan J.S. Lodish H.F. J.

In adipocytes, other recycling endosomal proteins, such as the transferrin receptor (TfR) and the IGFII/mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR), demonstrate the same response to insulin as Glut4 and IRAP but to a significantly lesser degree (6Wardzala L.J.

It has been suggested, therefore, that Glut4 and IRAP are sequestered into specialized post-endosomal insulin-sensitive vesicles, or IRVs with much higher insulin responsiveness than endosomes and non-specialized endosome-derived transport vesicles (10Birnbaum M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 11Rea S. James D.E. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Simpson F. Whitehead J.P. James D.E.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), a post-endosomal insulin-responsive compartment has been postulated but never isolated and characterized. This may be attributed to significant technical difficulties in the biochemical separation of the intracellular Glut4-containing membranes. In addition, it is not clear to what extent cell homogenization contributes to heterogeneity of intracellular “Glut4-containing vesicles” since large membrane structures may be artificially fragmented into smaller vesicles upon cell homogenization. So, at present, it is not known whether a translocatable pool of Glut4 is accumulated in small insulin-responsive vesicles or in a large endocytic recycling compartment. Correspondingly, it is not yet clear whether insulin stimulates translocation of pre-existing vesicles, stimulates budding of new vesicles from endosomes, or both. Recently, we identified a novel protein, cellugyrin, in intracellular Glut4-containing membranes and prepared a monoclonal antibody against this protein (20Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36263-36268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cellugyrin, a four-transmembrane protein, represents a homologue of synaptogyrin, a major constituent of synaptic vesicles (21Janz R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2851-2857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In adipose cells, cellugyrin is co-localized with Glut4 (20Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36263-36268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, it is present only in the population of Glut4 vesicles, which is not recruited to the plasma membrane by insulin and permanently maintains its intracellular localization. Glut4 vesicles capable of cell surface translocation do not contain this protein (20Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36263-36268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that cellugyrin-positive Glut4 vesicles rapidly accumulate cell surface biotinylated MPR and can be readily loaded with radioactive transferrin. We suggest, therefore, that these vesicles originate from early endosomes. Cellugyrin-negative vesicles contain significantly less of both biotinylated MPR and radioactive transferrin and show dramatic insulin-stimulated translocation to the cell surface. Thus, cellugyrin-negative Glut4 vesicles are likely to represent the long sought post-endosomal IRVs. We found that an average cellugyrin-positive vesicle carries not more than one molecule of either Glut4, IRAP, or TfR, whereas cellugyrin-negative IRVs compartmentalize five to six molecules of Glut4, more than 10 molecules of IRAP, and still one molecule of TfR per vesicle. Thus, there is a stringent sorting step in the “Glut4 pathway” that results in the specific enrichment of Glut4 and IRAP, but not TfR in the specialized insulin-responsive compartment. Finally, we describe an experimental approach that allows us to obtain adipocyte extracts without cell homogenization. Under these conditions, the major fraction of Glut4 is still found in small cellugyrin-positive and cellugyrin-negative vesicles. We suggest that these vesicles may thus represent the major compartments of Glut4 storage and translocation in the living cell. In the present study, we used monoclonal anti-Glut4 antibody 1F8 (22James D.E. Brown R. Navarro J. Pilch P.F. Nature. 1988; 333: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar).

Rabbit anti-serum against sortilin was prepared by Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc., Hopkinton, MA using the peptide ac-CFGQSKLYRSEDYGKNFKD-amide (amino acids 17–34) as antigen. Monoclonal anti-TfR antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Monoclonal anti-cellugyrin antibody was described previously (20Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36263-36268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Adipocytes were isolated from the epididymal fat pads of male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–175 g) by collagenase digestion and transferred to KRP buffer (12.5 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 6 mmKCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.6 mm Na2HPO4, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 2.5 mmd-glucose, 2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Insulin was administered to cells (where indicated) to a final concentration of 10 nm for 15 min. After that, KCN was added to cells to final concentration 2 mm for 5 min., cells were washed three to four times with HES buffer cooled to 14–16 °C (20 mmHEPES, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, pH 7.4), and homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem Teflon pestle. Subcellular fractions were prepared as previously described (23Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Isolated fractions were resuspended in PBS, which contained all of the protease inhibitors listed above. Alternatively, non-homogenized cells were washed with HES and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min, which represents the first step of differential centrifugation in (23Simpson I.A. Yver D.R.

Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). 125I-transferrin (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to rat adipocytes to 1 μCi per 1 ml of packed cells alone or together with 75 nmnon-radioactive transferrin (Sigma). Cells were then treated with 2 mm KCN for 2 min at room temperature, washed, and homogenized as described above. Protein A-purified 1F8 antibody, anti-cellugyrin antibody, and nonspecific mouse IgG were each coupled to acrylic beads (Reacti-gel GF 2000, Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Before usage, the beads were saturated with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for at least 1 h and washed with PBS. The light microsomes (LM) from rat adipocytes were incubated separately with each of the specific and nonspecific antibody-coupled beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with PBS, and the adsorbed material was subsequently eluted with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS and Laemmli sample buffer without reductants in order to avoid dissociation of the coupled antibodies. Samples (0.2 ml) were loaded onto a 4.6-ml continuous 10–30% sucrose gradient and centrifuged for 55 min in a Beckman SW-50.1 rotor at 48,000 rpm. Each gradient was collected into 25 fractions starting from the bottom of the tube. Cell surface biotinylation was performed as described in detail earlier (24Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 138-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25210-25217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) was added to cells to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. To stop the reaction, 1 m Tris, pH 8.0, and 0.2 m KCN were added to final concentrations of 50 mm and 2 mm, respectively, for 2 min. After that, cells were immediately washed three times with HES buffer and cooled to 14–16 °C, and subcellular fractions were prepared as described above. Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar) but without reducing agents and were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) in 25 mmTris and 192 mm glycine. Following transfer, the membrane was blocked with 10% non-fat dry milk in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C. Proteins were visualized with specific antibodies, HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma), and an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Protein content was determined with the BCA kit (Pierce) according to manufacturer's instructions. Previously, we described the preparation of the monoclonal anti-cellugyrin antibody and anti-cellugyrin immunobeads (20Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36263-36268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Using these tools, we can readily separate cellugyrin-containing Glut4 vesicles from Glut4 vesicles that do not have this protein. For that, we first immunoadsorb cellugyrin-positive vesicles using anti-cellugyrin beads and then collect cellugyrin-negative vesicles that stay in the supernatant with the help of 1F8 beads. Fig. 1 shows the prominent “cargo” proteins of cellugyrin-positive and cellugyrin-negative Glut4 vesicles. Major pools of the receptors for mannose 6-phosphate/IGFII and transferrin as well as Glut4 and IRAP are localized in cellugyrin-positive vesicles. In basal adipocytes, cellugyrin-negative vesicles compartmentalize significant fractions of Glut4 and IRAP (30–50%) and small, but readily detectable amounts of MPR and TfR. Upon insulin administration, the amount of all recycling proteins is decreased in both cellugyrin-positive and -negative vesicles. The latter compartment, however, demonstrates a much more pronounced insulin response. These results along with previously published data (20Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36263-36268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) are consistent with the hypothesis that the cellugyrin-positive compartment represents early/sorting endosome-derived vesicles, and the cellugyrin-negative compartment represents post-endosomal IRVs. However, we were unable to detect endosomal marker proteins, such as rab4, rab11, or EEA1, in either cellugyrin-positive or -negative vesicles. We suggest, therefore, that these peripheral membrane proteins dissociate from membranes upon vesicle formation from endosomes. It is also possible that these proteins are removed from immunoadsorbed vesicles by several stringent washes required for sufficient purity. In any case, we were not able to reproduce an earlier report that showed the presence of rab4 in immunopurified Glut4 vesicles (27Cormont M. Tanti J.-F. Zahraoui A. VanObberghen E. Tavitian A. LeMarchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19491-19497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the nature of cellugyrin-positive and cellugyrin-negative Glut4 vesicles, we studied internalization of125I-transferrin into insulin-treated and not treated adipocytes. We have shown earlier that about 50% of the internalized transferrin is recovered in Glut4 vesicles (28Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We now confirm this result and demonstrate that, after 15 min of incubation with125I-transferrin, practically all radioactivity in Glut4 vesicles is recovered in the cellugyrin-positive Glut4 population (Fig.2). Addition of excess cold transferrin (75 nm) decreased the amount of internalized radioactivity to background (not shown). This result suggests that cellugyrin-positive vesicles account for virtually all early endosomal material in the total population of Glut4-containing membranes. To determine whether or not recycling receptors can be delivered to a cellugyrin-negative Glut4-containing compartment, we carried out two types of experiments. First, we studied the distribution of the cell surface-biotinylated MPR between cellugyrin-positive and cellugyrin negative Glut4 vesicles (Fig.3 A). We found that this receptor is rapidly internalized into cellugyrin-positive vesicles and only 30 min later does it become detectable in the cellugyrin-negative vesicles. Also, 125I-transferrin is internalized mostly into cellugyrin-positive vesicles but is also detectable in cellugyrin-negative vesicles after prolonged incubations (Fig.3 B). We believe that these results are consistent with Fig.1 and with our previous observations (25Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25210-25217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21703-21708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) showing that a certain fraction of TfR and MPR follows the Glut4 pathway in adipocytes. Thus recycling proteins, such as Glut4, IRAP, MPR, and TfR are present in both cellugyrin-positive endosomes and cellugyrin-negative post-endosomal IRVs. To more accurately compare the protein composition of these compartments, we used the following approach that we call an “antibody decoration technique”. The intracellular membrane fraction that contains the mixture of cellugyrin-positive and cellugyrin-negative Glut4 vesicles is incubated with nonspecific IgG or with antibodies against the cytoplasmic domains of Glut4, IRAP, or TfR. This material is fractionated in a velocity sucrose gradient, and the position of cellugyrin-positive vesicles is determined by Western blotting of the gradient fractions with anti-cellugyrin antibody (Fig.4 A). In a parallel experiment, the cellugyrin-positive compartment is removed from the membrane preparation by immunoadsorption as shown in Fig. 1, and cellugyrin-negative Glut4 vesicles are analyzed by the same technique. This time, however, anti-Glut4 antibody is used for Western blotting (Fig. 4 B). Binding of antibodies to vesicles makes them heavier and causes a shift in the gradient. This shift is proportional to the number of antibody molecules bound to the vesicle. Knowing that the sedimentation coefficient of the IgG molecule is 4 S, it is possible to estimate the average number of Glut4, IRAP, and TfR molecules in cellugyrin-positive and -negative vesicles. Using this approach, we have shown that, although Glut4, IRAP, and TfR are certainly present in cellugyrin-positive vesicles (Fig. 1 and Ref.20Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36263-36268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)), binding of specific antibodies does not induce significant shifts in the sedimentation coefficient of this compartment (Fig.4 A). This means that cellugyrin-positive vesicles contain not more than one molecule of either Glut4, IRAP, or TfR per vesicle (a shift of 5 S is readily detectable under these conditions). The same results were obtained when we used anti-cellugyrin and anti-VAMP2 antibodies for these experiments (results not shown). On the contrary, an average post-endosomal cellugyrin-negative Glut4 vesicle (IRV) carries approximately five to six Glut4 molecules (shift 22 S), more than 10 molecules of IRAP (shift >40 S), and still not more than one TfR molecule (Fig. 4 B). Thus, Glut4 and IRAP, but not TfR, are specifically accumulated in cellugyrin-negative vesicles. These data clearly illustrate that there is a sorting step in the Glut4 pathway, which functions to specifically “gather” Glut4 and IRAP, but not TfR, and to pack them into post-endosomal vesicles, IRVs. In these experiments, we were not able to analyze cellugyrin-negative vesicles from insulin-treated cells, since their amount is very low due, most likely, to almost complete fusion with the plasma membrane upon insulin stimulation. In control experiments, we incubated LM with 1F8 antibody for different times (1, 2, and 5 h) and also used different amounts of 1F8 (5 and 25 μg) for the same amount of LM (150 μg). In all these cases, we obtained similar results (not shown). Thus, the shift in the sedimentational distribution of Glut4 vesicles caused by binding to 1F8 does not depend on experimental conditions. Our data described here, as well as in our previous paper (20Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36263-36268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), indicate that the cellugyrin-positive Glut4-compartment represent intracellular transport vesicles that originate from early endosomes and cellugyrin-negative Glut4-compartment may be the IRVs. As it is seen in Fig. 4, A and B, the sedimentation coefficient of cellugyrin-positive vesicles is somewhat smaller than that of cellugyrin-negative vesicles (see also Ref. 20Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36263-36268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This suggests that cellugyrin-positive vesicles do not represent intact endosomes, since these organelles are known to be large structures that should have a much higher sedimentation coefficient than small membrane vesicles (30Verges M. Havel R.J. Mostov K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10146-10151Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). It is quite possible, however, that upon cell homogenization endosomes are artificially fragmented into small vesicles of roughly the same size as vesicles formed in vivo. To determine whether or not cellugyrin-positive and -negative vesicles represent an artifact of cell homogenization, we omitted the homogenization step during subcellular fractionation of rat adipocytes. It turns out that traditional homogenization with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer is absolutely not necessary for further manipulations of adipose cells. In the experiment shown in Fig.5, the cell homogenate (panel A) or not homogenized, washed adipocytes (panel B) were placed in centrifuged tubes and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 20 min (the first step of the “classical” protocol of Simpson et al.Ref. 23Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Such centrifugation appears to be quite sufficient to break open primary adipocytes. The crude fractions resulting from the centrifugation (the lipid cake, the liquid phase, and the pellet) look identical regardless of whether or not the cells have been homogenized. The total amount of protein (the liquid phase and the pellet together) obtained was 2042 ± 250.4 μg per rat for homogenized and 2003 ± 34 μg per rat for non-homogenized cells. In both cases, the pellet accounts for 20–25% of the total protein recovered. Note, that presence of intact cells in the pellet is highly unlikely, since primary rat adipocytes float upon centrifugation. As it was shown previously for the standard protocol (23Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and confirmed in numerous laboratories including ours, the pellet of this centrifugation is composed of heavy subcellular structures, such as nuclei, mitochondria, lysosomes, the plasma membrane, etc. Microscopic evaluation showed that all of these organelles were also present in the first pellet of our procedure (results not shown). However, as is seen in Fig. 5, homogenization dramatically changes the distribution of fragile subcellular structures, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and intermediate filaments, between the pellet and the supernatant. In non-homogenized cells, both ER and intermediate filaments were found almost exclusively in the pellet, while homogenization lead to visible fragmentation of these structures into smaller particles that could not be pelleted at 16,000 × g. Cell homogenization did not significantly affect the distribution of Glut4, cellugyrin, and the endosomal markers between the pellet and in the supernatant of the 16,000 × g centrifugation (Fig.5). We thus suggest that, unlike endoplasmic reticulum and intermediate filaments, endosomes are not likely to be fragmented by homogenization and are actually pelleted under these conditions along with the plasma membrane, lysosomes, and other heavy intracellular organelles. This hypothesis is consistent with the sedimentational properties of endosomes obtained from homogenized PC12 cells (32Herman G.A. Bonzelius F. Cieutat A.-M. Kelly R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12750-12754Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and Chines hamster ovary (33Lim S.-N. Bonzelius F. Low S.H. Wille H. Weimbs T. Herman G.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) cells. In the following experiment we compared the sedimentational distribution of Glut4- and cellugyrin-containing membranes obtained in the standard subcellular fractionation protocol (23Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) with those isolated from not homogenized cells. For that, we centrifuged LM (200 μg) along with the supernatant of the low-speed centrifugation (2 mg) shown in Fig. 5 B in a continuous 10–30% sucrose gradient. For these experiments, we used 10 times more of the supernatant than pelleted LM, because 90% of the total protein in the supernatant is accounted for by cytoplasm that does not contain proteins of interest. Note that unlike LM, membranes in the supernatant have never been pelleted and resuspended before gradient centrifugation. Nonetheless, Fig. 6 demonstrates that the distribution of Glut4, cellugyrin, IRAP, sortilin, TfR, and MPR is identical regardless of the protocol used for membrane isolation. On the contrary, fragments of ER and intermediate filaments were present only in LM, probably due to artificial fragmentation during homogenization. These structures were completely absent from the material prepared from non-homogenized cells. Thus, cell homogenization results in the artificial fragmentation of ER and cytoskeleton, but does not affect the size of cellugyrin-positive and cellugyrin-negative Glut4 vesicles. We show here that the intracellular Glut4-containing membranes can be separated into two distinct compartments: cellugyrin-positive and cellugyrin-negative vesicles. The first compartment has low specific content of recycling proteins and moderate insulin sensitivity. On the contrary, cellugyrin-negative vesicles have high specific content of Glut4 and IRAP and show a profound response to insulin (Fig. 1). Moreover, we present evidence that both types of vesicles are present in extracts of non-homogenized cells and, therefore, may represent the major Glut4 compartments in vivo. Such a conclusion is consistent with the results of electron microscopy demonstrating that in adipocytes, Glut4 resides in vesicles and short tubules rather than in typical endosomes (13Slot S.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 16Malide D. Ramm G. Cushman S.W. Slot J.W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4203-4210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tubulo-vesicular Glut4-containing structures revealed by electron microscopy are 50–80 nm in diameter (13Slot S.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 16Malide D. Ramm G. Cushman S.W. Slot J.W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4203-4210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This size corresponds very well to the sedimentation coefficient of Glut4 vesicles determined in our experiments (50–80 S, Fig. 4). Thus, small Glut4 vesicles recovered in vitro upon subcellular fractionation may also exist in vivo. This indicates that the translocatable pool of Glut4 is retained in adipocytes in a form of small vesicles and not in a large endocytic recycling compartment. Based on this conclusion, we suggest that the primary effect of insulin should be translocation of pre-existing vesicles, rather than stimulation of the budding reaction, although these effects are not incompatible (see below). Cellugyrin-positive vesicles carry both plasma membrane markers, such as 125I-transferrin-bound TfR and biotinylated MPR, and cellugyrin, a protein that, according to our previous studies, is not present at the plasma membrane (20Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36263-36268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We think, therefore, that this compartment represents early endosome-derived vesicles. This explanation is totally consistent with the recent results of Limet al., who showed that in Chines hamster ovary cells, endosome-derived small vesicles represent a major cellular pool for recycling membrane proteins including ectopically expressed Glut4 and endogenous IRAP (33Lim S.-N. Bonzelius F. Low S.H. Wille H. Weimbs T. Herman G.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We suggest, furthermore, that cellugyrin-positive vesicles carry recycling proteins from early endosomes to recycling endosomes that function as a major sorting station in the cell (31Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar,34Robinson M.S. Watts C. Zerial M. Cell. 1996; 84: 13-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It was shown previously that transition from early to recycling endosomes represents a default pathway that does not require any specific targeting sequences (35Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In agreement with these data, we found that several recycling proteins, such as Glut4, IRAP, and TfR, are represented in cellugyrin-positive transport vesicles in a random fashion. Sorting in recycling endosomes by an as yet unknown mechanism results in the formation of insulin-responsive cellugyrin-negative Glut4 vesicles or IRVs with much a higher content of specific recycling proteins such as Glut4 and IRAP. Cellugyrin is not allowed entry into IRVs and is probably returned back to early endosomes by rapid retrograde transport (36Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cellugyrin-positive and cellugyrin-negative Glut4 vesicles demonstrate different responses to insulin stimulation. There is a small but consistent insulin-induced decrease in the amount of recycling proteins in cellugyrin-positive vesicles (Fig. 1). We think that insulin may stimulate to some degree their fusion with recycling endosomes. This hypothesis is consistent with recent report showing, by immunofluorescence microscopy, that insulin accelerates interendosomal Glut4 traffic in L6 myoblasts (37Foster L.J. Li D. Randhawa V.K. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44212-44221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). At the same time, the amount of cellugyrin-negative vesicles in insulin-treated cells is decreased to a much higher extent indicating that virtually all IRVs are translocated to the plasma membrane in response to insulin stimulation. Thus, given that Glut4 and associated proteins recycle constantly in stimulated adipocytes (25Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25210-25217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 38Satoh S. Nishimura H. Clark A.E. Kozka I.J. Vanucci S.J. Simpson I.A. Quon M.J. Cushman S.W.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), insulin may up-regulate several if not all steps of the Glut4 pathway in order to maintain high levels of Glut4 at the plasma membrane. It is known that glucose uptake in adipocytes can be activated by multiple signaling pathways (40Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1865-1868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel PI 3-kinase-independent signaling pathway for Glut4 translocation has been discovered (41Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3968) Google Scholar). At present, it is not very clear how all these signaling pathways including the novel CAP-mediated pathway are related to traditional PI 3-kinase-mediated insulin signaling. One attractive hypothesis is that different insulin signaling pathways work in concert but signal to different intracellular Glut4 compartments. For example, the novel Cbl/CAP-mediated pathway may trigger exocytosis of the preformed IRVs, whereas the traditional PI 3-kinase/Akt-mediated pathway may accelerate the transition of Glut4 from early/sorting endosomes to recycling endosomes or vice versa. Yet another interesting observation is the following. Small cellugyrin-positive vesicles have not more than one molecule of either Glut4 or IRAP per vesicle. Larger cellugyrin-negative vesicles have a much higher specific content of these proteins (Fig. 4). At the same time, the total amount of Glut4 and IRAP found in the former compartment is the same or even greater than in the latter (Fig. 1). This suggests that, in the cell, there are several times more of the smaller, early endosome-derived cellugyrin-positive vesicles than the larger cellugyrin-negative IRVs. Finally, our results may explain why insulin stimulates recycling of TfR and MPR in adipocytes as described previously in detail by several research groups (6Wardzala L.J. Simpson I.A. Rechler M.M. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8378-8383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Oka Y. Mottola C. Oppenheimer C.L. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8975-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We suggest that, unlike Glut4 and IRAP, these receptors are not actively sorted into IRVs, but a fraction of both TfR and MPR can still penetrate into this insulin-responsive compartment (Figs. 1 and 3). Thus, in adipose cells, TfR and MPR may recycle through both Glut4-committed and non-committed, ubiquitous endosomal pathways (see also Refs. 25Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25210-25217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This may explain the fact that overall recycling of TfR and MPR in adipocytes demonstrate some insulin responsiveness, which is, however, less than the insulin responsiveness of Glut4 and IRAP that recycle exclusively via the regulated “specialized” pathway.

Thoidis for helpful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript, and Hongwu Zheng and Zhao Xu for help with several experiments."

https://openalex.org/W1973318395,"Vav proteins are GDP/GTP exchange factors for Rho/Rac GTPases that are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation. These proteins activate Rac1, RhoG, and RhoA but not the highly related Cdc42 protein. At present, there is no available information to explain this substrate selectivity at the structural level. Here we show that the selection of Vav proteins substrates is achieved at two different levels. On one hand, Vav proteins utilize some residues of the beta2/beta3 region of Rho/Rac GTPases (D49 and E54) to assure the specific binding to its substrate. In addition, these exchange factors need a second structural signal located in the beta5 region of Rho/Rac proteins (residue K118) to promote proper GDP/GTP exchange. These results identify the amino acid residues that allow the discrimination of the Vav family substrates from Cdc42 and, in addition, demonstrate that the activation of specific Rho/Rac GTPases by these GEFs requires two concatenated events, binding and subsequent enzyme reaction, whose specificities are determined by two separate regions of Rho proteins."

The x-ray structure of the C2 domain of βPKC shows that three Ca2+ions can be coordinated by two opposing loops at one end of the domain. Starting from this x-ray structure, we have performed molecular dynamics (MD) calculations on the C2 domain of βPKC bound to three Ca2+ ions, to two Ca2+ ions, and in the Ca2+-free state, in order to analyze the effect of calcium on the RACK-binding sites and the pseudo-RACK sites, as well as on the loops that constitute the binding site for the Ca2+ ions. The results show that calcium stabilizes the β-sandwich structure of the C2 domain and thus affects two of the three RACK-binding sites within the C2 domain. Also, the interactions between the third RACK-binding site and the pseudo-RACK site are not notably modified by the removal of Ca2+ ions. On that basis, we predict that the pseudo-RACK site within the C2 domain masks a RACK-binding site in another domain of βPKC, possibly the V5 domain. Finally, the MD modeling shows that two Ca2+ ions are able to interact with two molecules of O-phospho-l-serine.

Most members of this family are activated by phosphatidylserine (PS), diacylglycerol (DG), and, to different extents, by other lipid second messengers and Ca2+ ions (1.Parker P.J. Kour G. Marais R.M. Mitchell F. Pears C. Schaap D. Stabel S. Webster C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1989; 65: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 2.Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar). There are at least three subfamilies of PKCs, classified according to their homology and sensitivity to activators (2.Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 3.Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 4.Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). βPKC belongs to the so-called classic PKC subfamily, or cPKC (α, βI, βII, and γ kinases). The members of this class contain four conserved domains (C1, C2, C3, and C4) inter-spaced with isozyme-unique (variable or V) domains. The βI and βII PKC isozymes are splice products of the same gene and therefore differ only in their C-terminal V5 domain (5.Coussens L. Parker P.J. Rhee L. Yang-Feng T.L. Chen E. Waterfield M.D. Francke U. Ullrich A. Science. 1986; 233: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). The C2 domain is found also in proteins other than PKC (4.Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Because many of these proteins bind lipids and particularly PS in a calcium-dependent manner, it was obvious to suggest that the calcium- and PS-binding sites reside within this domain (6.Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 806-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment studies (4.Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) revealed that the C2 domains exhibit two types of topologies (type I and II), but all have a β-sandwich fold composed of four β-strands in each face of the structure (7.Rizo J. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Based on this homology, the C2 domain was suggested to contain the calcium switch required for localization to the membrane (8.Shao X. Li C. Fernandez I. Zhang X. Rizo J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, immunofluorescence studies did not agree with simple localization of the activated PKC isozymes to the plasma membrane. We found that activated PKC isozymes are each localized to unique intracellular sites and, therefore, suggested that this unique localization is mediated by their selective interactions with specific anchoring proteins, termed Receptors for Activated C-Kinase (RACKs, see Fig. 1) (9.Hyatt S.L.

We subsequently demonstrated that the unique cellular functions of PKC isozymes are indeed dependent on the binding of each isozyme to its corresponding RACK, bringing the active PKC within a close proximity to particular subsets of substrates and away from others (3.Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). We found that the C2 domain of cPKC mediates at least some of the direct protein-protein interactions between cPKC and RACKs (15.Mochly-Rosen D. Miller K.G. Scheller R.H. Khaner H. Lopez J. Smith B.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8120-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The RACK1-binding site of βPKC-C2 domain (Fig. 2) was identified by sequence homology analysis with synaptotagmin, another C2 domain-containing and calcium-dependent PS-binding protein, also called p65 (15.Mochly-Rosen D. Miller K.G. Scheller R.H. Khaner H. Lopez J. Smith B.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8120-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We reasoned that, because the C2 domain of synaptotagmin also binds to RACK1 (albeit with a 100-fold lower affinity) (15.Mochly-Rosen D. Miller K.G. Scheller R.H. Khaner H. Lopez J. Smith B.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8120-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), sequences most conserved between the two domains in the βPKC-C2 domain would contain the RACK1-binding sites. Peptides corresponding to amino acids 186–198 (MDPNGLSDPYVKL, βC2-2 site;red in Fig. 2), 209–216 (KQKTKTIK, βC2-1 site;orange in Fig. 2), and 218–226 (SLNPEWNET, βC2-4 site;blue in Fig. 2) were predicted to contain the RACK-binding sites (16.Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 17.Souroujon M.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Structures of the C2 domain obtained by x-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy (18.Shao X. Davletov B.A. Sutton R.B. Rizo J. Science. 1996; 273: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 19.Sutton R.B. Sprang S.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1395-1405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) demonstrate that these RACK-binding sequences in βPKC-C2 are located on three exposed β-strands in the domain (Fig. 2B). Peptides corresponding to these three β-strands specifically inhibit activation-induced translocation of the C2-containing cPKC isozymes and their functions in cells (16.Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 20.Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). As predicted, a peptide derived from a non-conserved region of the C2 domain (βC2-3, amino acids 201–207, IPDPKSE; yellow in Fig. 2), which is not adjacent to the RACK-binding strands, had no effect on PKC binding to RACK, or βPKC translocation and function in cells (16.Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). It therefore appears that the C2 domain of PKC has a dual role. Upon activation, the domain binds PS in a calcium-dependent manner, which results in membrane binding of the enzyme. In addition, this domain participates in specific protein-protein interactions with the corresponding RACK, bringing the activated isozyme to a close proximity with a subset of substrates and away from others, thus mediating functional specificity of this family of enzymes. Using the same logic, we suggested that translocation activators should be agonists of PKC function, independent of the amount of second messengers that normally activate PKC (21.Ron D. Chen C.-H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). We predicted that such peptide agonists would bind the unstable transition state between inactive and activated PKC, causing exposure of the catalytic site and the RACK-binding site and thus enabling the anchoring of the enzyme to RACKs (Fig. 1). Indeed, a βPKC-derived peptide, termed pseudo-RACK1 peptide or ψβRACK because of its homology to RACK1 (amino acids 241–246 within the C2 domain, SVEIWD, green in Fig. 2), binds to βPKC, activates it in the absence of PS and calcium in vitro, and acts as a selective agonist of βPKC function in vivo (22.Ron D. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). We proposed that the ψβRACK site in βPKC is an autoregulatory site (17.Souroujon M.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 21.Ron D. Chen C.-H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). When βPKC is in an inactive conformation, the ψβRACK site interacts with the RACK1-binding site; activation of PKC exposes the RACK1-binding site, enabling the association of the enzyme with its anchoring RACK (22.Ron D. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). A model for this interaction is shown in Fig. 1, and the relative position of the RACK1-binding sites within C2 and the ψβRACK site are indicated in the primary structure and in the secondary structure (Fig. 2A) as well as in the tertiary structure of the domain (Fig. 2B). Because βPKC binds to RACK1 upon activation with calcium and PS, we studied the conformational changes in the C2 RACK-binding sites in the absence and presence of these factors using computer simulation techniques of molecular dynamics (MD). MD can provide an insight into the structure and dynamics of proteins. Although such simulations are limited by the number of conformational spaces that can be sampled, these techniques are quite effective in monitoring even subtle structural changes and variations in residue-residue interactions, also when the comparison of very similar systems is concerned (23.McCammon J.A.

Biol. 1993; 3: 277-281Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar); in particular, the effect of calcium ions on protein structure was successfully evaluated on peroxidases (28.Banci L. Carloni P. Diaz A. Gori Savellini G. JBIC. 1996; 1: 264-272Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Here, using MD simulations of the C2 domain of βPKC, we examined the effects of calcium binding on the RACK1-binding sites and ψβRACK site within the C2 domain. Activated βPKC has been reported to bind two (18.Shao X. Davletov B.A. Sutton R.B. Rizo J. Science. 1996; 273: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) or three (19.Sutton R.B. Sprang S.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1395-1405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) Ca2+ ions in the C2 domain. Therefore, MD calculations were performed on the C2 domain of βPKC with three Ca2+ ions (hereafter referred to as βPKC-3Ca), with two Ca2+ ions (βPKC-2Ca hereafter), and with no Ca2+ ions (βPKC hereafter), using the available x-ray structure as the starting model (19.Sutton R.B. Sprang S.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1395-1405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Because a direct correlation between calcium and PS binding has also been demonstrated, a simple model was built to examine the possibility that Ca2+ ions bound to the domain are directly involved in PS binding. Three molecules of O-phospho-l-serine, which mimic the headgroup of PS, were positioned near the Ca2+ ions in the MD structure of βPKC-3Ca. An MD simulation was also performed on this complex (βPKC-3Ca·PS hereafter). Our MD studies suggest that, although conformational changes occur within the C2 domain due to calcium and PS binding, they are unlikely to mediate the disruption of interaction of the ψβRACK site with a RACK-binding site within the C2 domain. All calculations were carried out using AMBER 5.0 (29.Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham T.E. Ferguson D.M. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. AMBER 5.0.

The x-ray structure of the C2 domain of rat βPKC complexed with three Ca2+ ions (2.7-Å resolution, PDB entry 1A25) was used to model the starting structures (19.Sutton R.B. Sprang S.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1395-1405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although the crystal structure contains two molecules of βPKC-C2 related by a dyad axis in the asymmetric unit (19.Sutton R.B. Sprang S.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1395-1405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the modeling was conducted on a single molecule. This domain contains 132 residues (157–288 of the complete sequence), corresponding to 1088 heavy atoms. The water molecules found in the crystal structure were excluded, following the standard procedure for protein simulations in explicit water described in the AMBER manual (29.Pearlman D.A. Case D.A.

Hydrogen atoms, which are missing in the 1A25 PDB file, were added through the EDIT module of AMBER, resulting in 2173 atoms in the native structure. The Ca2+ ions were added to the standard AMBER residue data base by the PREP module of AMBER: They were treated as divalent cations, with a van der Waals radius of 1.60 Å, and ε (i.e. 6–12 potential well depth) of 0.1 kcal mol−1, based on previous MD calculations dealing with the effect of calcium ions on the structure of peroxidases (28.Banci L. Carloni P. Diaz A. Gori Savellini G. JBIC. 1996; 1: 264-272Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The starting positions of the Ca2+ ions were set according to their coordinates in the x-ray structure and were labeled II, III, and IV, following Sutton and Sprang notation (19.Sutton R.B. Sprang S.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1395-1405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). For βPKC-2Ca, calcium II and III were chosen, on the basis of the model of Ca2+binding by C2 domains depicted by Shao et al. in Ref. 18.Shao X. Davletov B.A. Sutton R.B. Rizo J. Science. 1996; 273: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar: In that work, two calcium ions were found to be bound to the C2 domain through NMR spectroscopy. No direct bond was set between the calcium ions and any protein groups, and no distance constraints were introduced to prevent a bias in the modeling, i.e. the calcium ions are free to leave the protein. A shell of TIP3P (36.Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (30557) Google Scholar) water molecules extending 10 Å in every direction from the protein surface was created using the SOL option of the EDIT module of AMBER, resulting in the introduction of about 2100 water molecules for all the model systems. Proper counterions were generated by the CION program of AMBER and positioned near free charged surface residues of the protein to achieve an overall charge of zero on each system, ensuring that electrostatic interactions were not broken. A 10-Å cut-off for the evaluation of the non-bonded interactions was used, resulting in the evaluation of 2.5–2.6 × 106 pair interactions. Because proteins are systems where long-range electrostatics are expected to play an important role in determining molecular conformational energies and structures, the choice of the cut-off for non-bonded interactions is significantly important for the quality of the simulation. The value of 10 Å adopted here was shown (28.Banci L. Carloni P. Diaz A. Gori Savellini G. JBIC. 1996; 1: 264-272Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 32.Wang W. Lim W.A. Jakalian A. Wang J. Wang J.

The solvent molecules were equilibrated initially by energy minimization and subsequently by performing 15 ps of MD. After energy minimization of the whole system (protein + water + counterions), MD trajectories were calculated. Temperature was initially increased from 0 to 300 K (performing three MD runs of 3 ps each at 100, 200, and 300 K, respectively) and then maintained constant for the whole simulation time, coupling the protein to a thermal bath (40.Berendsen H.J.C.

Comput. Phys. 1983; 52: 24-34Crossref Scopus (2375) Google Scholar) was applied on all bonds during all the MD runs. However, a time-step of 1.5 fs could be used only in the calculation of the trajectory for βPKC, whereas a time-step of 1.0 fs was used both for βPKC-3Ca and βPKC-2Ca, due to instability of the trajectory in the initial steps of the simulations. The pair list was updated every 20 steps, and coordinates and energy values were collected every 100 steps for further analysis. The simulations were performed for 1060 ps, and the final 1000 ps were taken for the analysis. This time frame was chosen because βPKC system reached stabilization, i.e. the structure reached an average constant r.m.s.d. 2r.m.s.d. (root mean square deviation) is defined as (ΣiΔri2/i)½, where Δri is the displacement of an atom in a structure with respect to a reference structure, and the sum is performed over the atoms of the backbone, or over the heavy atoms,i.e. all the atoms excluding hydrogen. with respect to the starting structure, after the initial 60 ps (Fig. 3). βPKC-3Ca and βPKC-2Ca equilibrated faster, in about 10 ps (Fig. 3). The average structures were calculated by averaging the coordinates at the various steps of the trajectories. The average structures were then subjected to energy minimization and subsequently analyzed by the program PROCHECK (44.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) to confirm the stereochemical quality of the model structures. In the βPKC-3Ca·PS model, three molecules of O-phospho-l-serine were built by the PREP module of AMBER and initially positioned in proximity of the Ca2+ions of βPKC-3Ca average structure, to evaluate the possibility of a direct calcium·PS interaction (45.Perisic O. Fong S. Lynch D.E. Bycroft M. Williams R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1596-1604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the initial calcium·PS distance was set larger than coordination distance, to prevent a bias in the modeling of such interaction. The internal coordinates and the parameters for O-phospho-l-serine were obtained from data for serine and PO2 groups already present in AMBER libraries. The procedure for MD modeling of this complex was performed as described above, consisting of solvation, energy minimization, heating, and dynamics. The simulation time was 600 ps, with 1.0 fs as the time-step. The MD average structure, which is shown in Fig. 4A, is very similar to the original x-ray structure (19.Sutton R.B. Sprang S.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1395-1405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), with average r.m.s.d. values of 0.85 Å for the backbone and 1.46 Å for the heavy atoms. The r.m.s.d. values per residue are shown in Fig. 5A. All the secondary structure elements found in the crystal structure are also present after MD, as shown in Fig. 6 (top scheme). The average fluctuation is 0.45 ± 0.05 Å for the backbone and 0.52 ± 0.21 Å for the heavy atoms. These values, which indicate the range of fluctuations of the protein over the time of simulation, are rather low and suggest that the molecule is quite rigid. The plot in Fig. 6 reports the average heavy atom fluctuation per residue; the residues with the highest relative mobility correspond to the main loops of the domain, i.e. loop 2–3 (residues 182–193), loop 3–4 (residues 202–209), loop 4–5 (residues 212–221), and loop 6–7 (residues 247–253). α-Helix 2 (residues 280–283) also shows relatively large fluctuations.Figure 5r.m.s.d. per residue of the MD structure of βPKC-3Ca (A), βPKC-2Ca (B), and βPKC (C) with respect to the x-ray structure.

That coordination is maintained during the whole βPKC-3Ca simulation. Because neither direct bonds nor distance constraints were set between Ca2+ ions and any protein groups, we infer that these binding sites for calcium are highly stable. The coordination sphere is completed with water molecules. Site IV, which is hexacoordinate in the crystal structure (19.Sutton R.B. Sprang S.R.

Phosphatidylserine (PS) is an acidic lipid located exclusively on the cytoplasmic face of biological membranes and is required for PKC activation (1.Parker P.J. Kour G. Marais R.M. Mitchell F.

https://openalex.org/W2333263033,"Heregulins are a group of growth factors that play diverse and critical roles in the signaling network of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER or EGFR) superfamily. Our earlier studies have shown that recombinant heregulinβ1 (HRG) induces apoptosis in SKBr3 breast cancer cells that overexpress HER2. Here we report molecular mechanisms of HRG-induced apoptosis. HRG treatment of SKBr3 cells for 72 h decreased the level of Bcl-2 protein. HRG treatment led to degradation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and activated both caspase-9 and caspase-7. No significant activation of caspase-3, -6, or -8 was detected. Expression of exogenous caspase-7 by adenovirus-caspase-7 (Ad-casp-7) in SKBr3 cells resulted in apoptosis, which mimicked the effect of HRG treatment. Expression of exogenous caspase-7 had no impact on Bcl-2 expression, but promoted PARP degradation. Two highly selective inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), GF109203X (GF) and Ro318425 (Ro), significantly enhanced HRG-induced apoptosis as determined by flow cytometric analysis and DNA fragmentation assay. Accordingly, the PKC inhibitor GF further decreased the level of Bcl-2 protein and further degraded PARP in HRG-treated cells. Assay of PKC activity indicated that HRG activated PKC in SKBr3 cells, predominantly affecting the PKCα isoform. To confirm which PKC isoform(s) mediated potentiation of HRG-induced apoptosis, the profile of PKC isoforms was measured in SKBr3 cells. Five PKC isoforms, PKCα, PKCι, PKCζ, PKCλ, and PKCδ as well as their receptors (RACK1) were expressed in this cell line. Treatment with PKC inhibitors GF and Ro decreased protein levels of both PKCα and PKCδ at 24 h. PKCα levels were still depressed at 72 h. GF and Ro had little effect on the expression of other PKC isoforms. An inhibitor of classical PKC isoforms (Go6976) enhanced HRG-induced apoptosis, whereas the PKCδ selective inhibitor rottlerin did not. As PKCα was the only classical isoform expressed in SKBr3 cells, the effect of Go6976 on HRG-induced apoptosis largely related to inhibition of PKCα. Constitutive expression of wild-type PKCα attenuated the apoptosis produced by HRG and GF. Consequently, HRG-induced apoptosis in SKBr3 cells appeared to involve down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein, activation of caspase-9 and caspase-7, and degradation of PARP. Inhibition of PKC function enhanced HRG-induced apoptosis, leading to synergistic down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression. Impairment of the PKCα isoform alone was sufficient to potentiate HRG-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2059836202,"MEKK1, a 196-kDa mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase, generates anti-apoptotic signaling as a full-length protein but induces apoptosis when cleaved by caspases. Here, we show that caspase-dependent cleavage of MEKK1 relocalizes the protease-generated 91-kDa kinase fragment from a particulate fraction to a soluble cytoplasmic fraction. Relocalization of MEKK1 catalytic activity is necessary for the pro-apoptotic function of MEKK1. The addition of a membrane-targeting signal to the 91-kDa fragment inhibits caspase activation and the induction of apoptosis but does not change the activation of JNK, ERK, NFκB, or p300. These results identify the caspase cleavage of MEKK1 as a dynamic regulatory mechanism that alters the subcellular distribution of MEKK1, changing its function to pro-apoptotic signaling, which does not depend on the currently described MEKK1 effectors."

We hypothesized that hereditary and/or acquired mutations in apoptosis-associated genes, such as p53 and caspases, may protect NPCs from DNA damage-induced death and predispose them to subsequent neoplastic transformation. To test this hypothesis, we exposed NPCs from wild-type and targeted gene-disrupted mouse embryos (p53, caspase-9, caspase-3, and bax mutants) to ethyl-nitrosourea (ENU), a known DNA mutagen and neural carcinogen, and measured NPC viability. We found that ENU produced caspase-3 activation and apoptotic NPC death 6-24 h after administration both in vivo and in vitro. This effect was critically dependent on p53 and caspase-9 expression. The long-term effect of intrauterine ENU exposure was examined in control and p53-deficient mice. High grade glial tumors were found in 60% of p53(-/-) young adult mice exposed to ENU on gestational day 12.5 but not in p53(+/-) or p53(+/+) littermates or in untreated p53-deficient mice. All the tumors were located supratentorially and possessed strong immunoreactivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein and the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-X(L). These results suggest that intrauterine exposure of NPCs to certain DNA damaging agents may synergistically interact with specific genetic abnormalities (e.g. p53 deficiency) to produce glial neoplasms in the adult brain."

https://openalex.org/W2032905613,"PARP is a multifunctional protein that can affect genome stability, transcription control, telomere length and cell death. Recently we have reported that PARP binds to and enhances B-MYB transactivating potential. B-MYB is a potentially oncogenic transcription factor involved in mammalian cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. B-MYB gene expression is growth regulated and B-MYB protein is phosphorylated during S phase by cyclin A or E/cdk2 kinase, resulting in augmented transactivating potential. Here we show that PARP induces phosphorylation of B-MYB protein at cdk2 phosphorylation sites, since a B-MYB protein with mutated cdk2 phosphorylation sites is refractory to PARP-induced phosphorylation and co-activation in mammalian cells. We propose that PARP functions as a B-MYB co-factor by promoting cyclin/cdk2-dependent B-MYB phosphorylation. These results highlight a novel role for PARP as a factor that integrates cyclin-dependent kinases signaling with gene transcription."

https://openalex.org/W2317573066,"The interferon (IFN)-induced, double stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated serine/threonine kinase, PKR, is a potent negative regulator of cell growth when overexpressed in yeast or mammalian cells. Paradoxically, while it can function as a tumor suppressor and inducer of apoptosis, it is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers. To resolve this enigma, we established cell-lines that overexpress PKR in non-transformed and in v-mos transformed CHO cells. Overexpression of PKR suppressed the proliferation of CHO cells by inducing a transient G0/G1 arrest, followed by a delayed G2/M arrest, which attenuated cell cycle progression. These effects were accompanied by early induction of p21/WAF-1 and delayed downregulation of CDC2 and cyclin B1. Induction of proapoptotic activity of the ectopic PKR paralleled the onset of G2/M arrest in CHO cells. However, while transiently inducing p21/WAF-1, PKR did not impose G2/M arrest or apoptosis in v-mos-transformed cells, nor was CDC2 or cyclin B1 down-regulated in those cells. These findings link the proapoptotic activity of PKR to the arrest of cell cycle at the G2/M phase. Consequently, the apoptotic activity of PKR could be counter-acted by an oncogene-like v-mos that overrides the G2/M arrest induced by PKR."

Because membrane receptors are the targets of pharmaceutical products, membrane receptor-ligand interactions are also of particular interest to the pharmaceutical industry. Unfortunately, the modern physical methodologies commonly used to probe the structural features responsible for receptor-ligand interactions are still limited in their application to membrane-imbedded receptors. The chemical nature of receptor-ligand interactions at the post-synaptic membrane have been studied intensively for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR1) fromTorpedo. Each of the two acetylcholine (ACh) binding sites on the nAChR consists of two subsites, an esterophilic subsite that binds the ester functional group of ACh and an anionic subsite that binds the quaternary ammonium cation (1Michelson M.J.

The difference spectra also contain vibrational information pertaining to the physical interactions that occur between Carb and nAChR binding site residues. Extensive band overlap, however, has thus far limited interpretation of the latter in terms of either the types of amino acid side chains involved or the precise nature of the physical interactions that occur between protein side chains and Carb. In this report we present the first analysis of nAChR-ligand interactions as studied by infrared difference spectroscopy. To circumvent the problems of extensive band overlap, we developed a new “double ligand difference” method that can be used to isolate the vibrational features from protein side chains that interact directly with individual functional groups on a small molecule ligand. This new double ligand approach allows one to map individual ligand-receptor contacts and simplifies the difference spectra allowing for a more detailed interpretation of the data. We show here that the frequencies of two main protein vibrations are altered when the nAChR interacts with the carbonyl oxygen of Carb. The frequencies of the detected vibrational bands suggest that a side chain in the esterophilic subsite, possibly an arginine, forms a hydrogen bond with the ester carbonyl. The results provide new insight into the nature of nAChR-ligand interactions and demonstrate the potential of infrared difference spectroscopy for dissecting the physical interactions that occur between a membrane receptor and its bound ligand. The nAChR from frozen Torpedo californica electric tissue (Marinus) was affinity-purified on a bromoacetylcholine bromide-derivatized Bio-Rad Affi-Gel 201 column and reconstituted into membranes composed of either 3:1:1 egg phosphatidyl-choline/dioleoylphosphatidic acid/cholesterol or asolectin (18McCarthy M.P. Moore M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7655-7663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both lipid compositions stabilize the nAChR in a conformation that conducts cations across the membrane and undergoes agonist-induced desensitization (16Ryan S.E. Demers C.N. Chew J.P. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24590-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). FTIR spectra were recorded using the attenuated total reflection technique on either an FTS-40 or an FTS-575 spectrometer (Bio-Rad), both equipped with a DTGS detector. A schematic diagram of the attenuated total reflectance cell used to record the spectra is shown in Fig. 1. For Carb resting-to-desensitized (R→D) difference spectra, two consecutive spectra of the resting nAChR were recorded while flowing wash buffer (250 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 3 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0) past the nAChR film present on the surface of a germanium internal reflection element. The flowing solution was switched to an identical one containing 50 μm Carb (trigger buffer) and, after 1 min, a spectrum was recorded of the desensitized state. The differences between both the two resting state spectra and the consecutive resting and desensitized state spectra were calculated, stored, and the flowing solution switched back to the wash buffer without Carb. After a 20-min washing period to remove Carb from the film, the process was repeated many times. Each spectrum was recorded at 8-cm−1 resolution using 512 scans. The presented spectra are averages of greater than 30 difference spectra recorded from at least two separate films. All difference spectra were baseline-corrected between 1800 and 1000 cm−1 and were interpolated to an effective resolution of 4 cm−1. Tetramethylamine (TMA) R→D difference spectra were recorded as described above, except that the trigger buffer contained 1 mm TMA instead of 50 μm Carb. Carb desensitized-to-desensitized (D→D) difference spectra were recorded as described above for the Carb R→D difference spectra, except that the wash and trigger buffers both contained 200 μmdibucaine so that the nAChR was bathed continuously with dibucaine and thus maintained throughout the experiment in the desensitized state. The double ligand difference spectra were recorded as described above for the Carb R→D difference spectra except that one ligand (either Carb or ACh) was included in the trigger buffer while the other ligand (either TMA or choline) was included in both the wash and trigger buffers. In the Carb-minus-TMA difference spectrum, for example, the trigger buffer contained 50 μm Carb and both the wash and trigger buffers contained 1 mm TMA. Two spectra of the nAChR with TMA bound to the neurotransmitter site were recorded. The flowing wash buffer was then switched to the trigger buffer, which contains sufficient Carb to displace TMA from the neurotransmitter binding site. The differences between both the two spectra recorded with TMA bound and the consecutive spectra recorded with first TMA and then Carb bound to the nAChR were calculated and stored, and the process was repeated many times. For the Carb-minus-choline difference, the trigger buffer contained both 50 μm Carb and 10 mm choline, and the wash buffer contained 10 mm choline. For the ACh-minus-TMA difference, the trigger buffer contained both 100 μm ACh and 1 mm TMA, and the wash buffer contained 1 mm TMA. For the ACh-minus-choline difference, the trigger buffer contained both 100 μm ACh and 10 mm choline, and the wash buffer 10 mmcholine. The difference between spectra of the nAChR recorded in the presence and absence of the agonist Carb (referred to as a Carb R→D difference spectrum) exhibits a pattern of positive and negative bands (Fig. 2, middle trace) that is absent in control difference spectra recorded from α-bungarotoxin-treated nAChR membranes (13Baenziger J.E. Miller K.W. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5448-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These bands reflect three related phenomena: 1) vibrations of Carb bound to the nAChR, 2) vibrational changes in the nAChR that occur upon the formation of physical interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, cation-π electron interactions, etc., between Carb and neurotransmitter binding site residues, and 3) vibrational changes in the nAChR that result from the Carb-induced R→D conformational transition. To interpret the Carb R→D difference spectrum, bands were first assigned to each of the three related phenomena noted above. Bands due to nAChR-bound Carb were identified by comparing band frequencies in the difference spectrum with those observed in solution spectra of Carb (light shading in Fig. 2), as well as by similar comparisons of difference and solution spectra recorded using ACh and an isotopically labeled derivative (13Baenziger J.E. Miller K.W. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5448-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Bands that reflect the structural changes associated with the R→D conformational change were identified by recording Carb difference spectra from nAChR membranes that were maintained continuously in the desensitized state prior to (and after) Carb addition (referred to as a Carb D→D difference spectrum; Fig. 2,bottom trace). The resulting Carb D→D difference spectra consistently lack positive intensity centered near 1668, 1655, 1547, 1430, and 1059 cm−1 that is observed in the Carb R→D difference spectrum (14Ryan S.E. Baenziger J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 15Ryan S.E. Blanton M.P. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4796-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Ryan S.E. Demers C.N. Chew J.P. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 777-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These five positive bands in the Carb R→D difference spectrum thus reflect the main vibrational changes associated with transition of the nAChR from a resting to the desensitized state (hatched shading in Fig. 2, middle trace). In contrast, bands that are not affected by desensitization and that are not attributable to nAChR-bound Carb must reflect vibrational changes in protein residues that occur upon the formation of physical interactions between Carb and the desensitized nAChR. These features are not shaded in Fig. 2. The large number of bands not attributable to either nAChR-bound Carb or the R→D conformational transition highlights the fact that the Carb R→D difference spectrum contains substantial vibrational information regarding the nature of Carb-nAChR interactions. Several vibrational features are observed at frequencies consistent with the expected frequencies of side chains known to be located in the neurotransmitter binding site (see Fig.3). The most notable is a relatively intense band near 1516 cm−1 that is characteristic of tyrosine (19Barth A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 141-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). The relative intensity of the band is indicative of a strong interaction, consistent with mutagenesis data that highlight the importance of tyrosines in agonist binding (5Tomaselli G.F. McLaughlin J.T. Jurman M.E. Hawrot E. Yellen G. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 721-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 6Aylwin M.L. White M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1149-1155PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, weak bands are observed in regions of the spectrum normally associated with the vibrations of tryptophan (near 1334 and 1455 cm−1) and carboxylate (near 1580 cm−1 and between 1300 and 1400 cm−1) residues. A number of other vibrations, most notably near 1620 cm−1, could reflect interactions between Carb and additional binding site residues (19Barth A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 141-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). The difference spectra thus suggest a rich complexity of interactions between Carb and the nAChR. To determine which vibrational features reflect interactions that occur between binding site residues and the quaternary amine of Carb, the difference between spectra recorded in the presence and absence of the agonist analog TMA, which lacks the alkyl carbamylester functional moiety, was calculated (third from top trace in Fig. 3). The TMA difference spectrum exhibits many of the same vibrational features observed in the Carb R→D difference spectrum, including bands near 1580, 1516, 1455, 1334, and between 1300 and 1400 cm−1that are potentially attributable to the aromatic side chains of tyrosine and tryptophan and the carboxylate side chains of aspartic/glutamic acid. In fact, most of the bands in the Carb R→D difference spectrum that are potentially attributable to vibrational changes in residues interacting with Carb are also present in the TMA difference spectrum. This result provides direct experimental evidence that tyrosine and possibly both tryptophan and carboxylate residues interact in some manner with the quaternary amine. The result also shows that the interactions between the nAChR and Carb are dominated by interactions with the quaternary amine functional group. The TMA difference spectrum also exhibits positive intensity at each of the five frequencies centered near 1668, 1655, 1547, 1430, and 1059 cm−1 that serve as markers of the R→D conformational transition. The positive intensity at each frequency suggests that exposure to TMA leads to a shift of the nAChR from a predominantly resting to a predominantly desensitized state. The ability of TMA to desensitize the nAChR is not surprising given that TMA is an agonist of the receptor (20Sine S.M. Quiram P. Papanikolaou F. Kreienkamp H.J. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8808-8816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21O'Leary M.E. White M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8360-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The desensitizing capability of TMA was also confirmed in a separate fluorescence spectroscopic study of the interactions between the conformationally sensitive probe, ethidium bromide, and the nAChR. 2J. E. Baenziger, unpublished observations. The difference between spectra of the nAChR recorded in the presence and absence of TMA is thus referred to as a TMA R→D difference spectrum. In contrast to the similarities above noted, band intensity variations are evident near 1720, 1485, 1420, 1395, 1345, 1138, 1104, and 1069 cm−1 and between both 1690 and 1668 cm−1 and 1635 and 1630 cm−1. The former reflect the different intrinsic vibrational frequencies and/or intensities of TMAversus Carb. The latter reflect differences in how the two ligands interact with the nAChR. Specifically, bands in the Carb R→D difference spectrum that are absent in the TMA R→D difference spectrum can be assigned to the vibrational changes that occur as a result of interactions between the alkyl carbamylester portion of Carb and residues in the esterophilic subsite. A complete interpretation of both the Carb and TMA R→D difference spectra in terms of both the identities of the amino acids involved and the nature of the individual Carb-nAChR contacts is hampered by the extensive band overlap. Band overlap does not allow for visualization of many individual difference bands that serve as fingerprints of amino acid side chains. The downshifts in frequency of individual bands that occur upon exposure to 2H2O, which are diagnostic of specific side chains, are also lost in the overlapping band shifts that occur in Carb R→D difference spectra recorded in2H2O versus 1H2O (27Baenziger J.E. Chew J.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3617-3624Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, the individual shifts in frequency that occur upon Carb binding to the nAChR, which are directly related to the nature of Carb-nAChR contacts, cannot be defined because of the spectral complexity. To simplify the difference spectrum and thus permit a definitive interpretation of the data, we devised a novel double ligand difference method (illustrated schematically in Fig.4). The idea was to calculate the difference between spectra of the nAChR recorded consecutively with TMA and then Carb bound to the neurotransmitter binding sites. Because both Carb and TMA stabilize the nAChR in a desensitized conformation, the difference between spectra of the nAChR recorded with either TMA or Carb bound to the neurotransmitter binding sites (referred to as a Carb-minus-TMA difference spectrum) should not exhibit vibrational bands reflecting the R→D conformational change. The vibrational features resulting from the formation of physical interactions between the quaternary amine of Carb and the anionic subsite should also be absent from the Carb-minus-TMA difference spectrum, because these interactions are already formed in the TMA-bound state. In fact, the Carb-minus-TMA difference spectrum should only exhibit positive and negative vibrational bands due to the intrinsic vibrations of bound Carb and competitively displaced TMA, respectively, as well as bands from esterophilic subsite residues whose structures and/or environments are altered upon interaction with the alkyl carbamylester portion of Carb (Fig. 4). As expected, the Carb-minus-TMA difference spectrum exhibits very few difference bands compared with either the Carb or TMA R→D difference spectra (Fig. 5). Clearly defined positive and negative bands due to nAChR-bound Carb and competitively displaced TMA are observed throughout the 1800–1000 cm−1region (Fig. 4, light shading). In contrast, relatively intense protein vibrations are only observed in the 1600–1700 cm−1 region near 1690, 1668, 1635, 1620, and 1605 cm−1. Other weak bands are difficult to assess at the signal-to-noise ratio of these spectra. The lack of protein vibrational features attributable to tyrosine, tryptophan, and carboxylic acid containing residues, etc. confirms that the majority of the strong physical contacts that occur between Carb and the nAChR take place at the anionic subsite. This result further highlights the importance of the quaternary amine in agonist binding. Two sets of positive/negative protein vibrations located near 1690/1668 cm−1 and 1620/1605 cm−1, as well as a weak positive vibration near 1635 cm−1 reflect vibrational changes in esterophilic subsite residues that occur upon interaction with the alkyl carbamylester portion of Carb. To further define the functional group on Carb that interacts with the esterophilic subsite residues leading to the noted band shifts, we recorded a series of double ligand difference spectra using Carb, TMA, ACh, and/or choline as ligands (Fig. 6). The ACh-minus-TMA difference spectrum is similar to the Carb-minus-TMA difference spectrum exhibiting the same difference peaks at 1690, 1668, 1635, 1620, and 1605 cm−1. The similarity of the difference spectra suggests that both Carb and ACh interact with the nAChR at the esterophilic subsite in a similar manner. In other words, the NH2 group of Carb does not appear to make strong physical contacts with residues in the esterophilic binding and is not involved in the physical interactions that lead to the vibrational shifts noted at 1690, 1668, 1635, 1620, and 1605 cm−1. Both the Carb-minus-choline and ACh-minus-choline also exhibit the two major positive and negative difference couples located at 1690/1668 cm−1 and 1620/2605 cm−1. There may be a subtle change in intensity near 1635 cm−1. The bands in the double ligand difference spectra located near 1690/1668 cm−1 and 1620/2605 cm−1 thus cannot be attributed to interactions between esterophilic subsite residues and either the methylene carbons or ester oxygen atom of Carb/ACh. The main vibrational changes detected in the double ligand difference spectra thus reflect interactions between esterophilic subsite residues and the carbonyl oxygen of Carb/ACh. Although definitive assignments of the bands observed in the double ligand difference spectra is not yet possible, the frequencies of the vibrations suggest possible candidate residues for mutagenesis studies. The main vibrations detected in the double ligand difference spectra occur in the amide I (peptide C=O stretch coupled to C–N stretching and N–H bending) frequency region (1600–1700 cm−1) of the infrared spectrum and could reflect vibrational changes resulting from the formation of hydrogen bonds with polypeptide carbonyl oxygens, possibly through a water molecule. Note that the formation of a hydrogen bond between peptide amide protons and the carbonyl oxygen seems unlikely given the absence of band shifts in the amide II (mainly N–H bending and C–N stretch) region of the spectrum (1520–1580 cm−1). Several side chains are also located in the ACh binding pocket of the homologous ACh binding protein that could interact with the carbonyl of Carb (10Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar), although the precise location of agonist binding to the neurotransmitter site has not yet been determined. These residues in the ACh binding protein include tyrosine 192, glutamine 55, arginine 104, valine 106, leucine 112, and methionine 114. The homologousTorpedo nAChR residues are α tyrosine 198, γ glutamate 57 and δ aspartate 59, γ leucine 109 and δ leucine 111, γ tyrosine 111 and δ arginine 113, γ tyrosine 117 and δ threonine 119, and γ leucine 119 and δ leucine 121, respectively (28Noda M. Takahashi H. Tanabe T. Toyosato M. Furutani Y. Hirose T. Asai M. Inayama S. Miyata T. Numa S. Nature. 1982; 299: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The side chains of tyrosine, glutamate, aspartate, leucine, and threonine do not normally contribute strong vibrational intensity exclusively in the 1600–1700 cm−1 region of the infrared spectrum and thus are not likely responsible for the vibrations detected in the Carb-minus-TMA difference spectrum (19Barth A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 141-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). In contrast, the asymmetric and symmetric CN3H5+ stretching vibrations of arginine are expected near 1670 and 1630 cm−1, frequencies consistent with the two sets of positive and negative couples near 1690/1668 cm−1 and 1620/1605 cm−1. Although other assignments are possible, a preliminary interpretation of our data is that the ester carbonyl of Carb interacts with an arginine side chain when binding to the desensitized state of the nAChR. Note, however, that the binding affinity of the ACh binding protein for ACh is 4.2 μm(29Smit A.B. Syed N.I. Schaap D. van Minnen J. Klumperman J. Kits K.S. Lodder H. van der Schors R.C. van Elk R. Sorgedrager B. Brejc K. Sixma T.K. Geraerts W.P.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In contrast, the desensitized nAChR binds ACh with an affinity of ∼2 nm (22Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5344-5353Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) suggesting conformational differences between the binding sites of the ACh binding protein and the desensitized nAChR. Additional candidate residues may thus be possible. Shifts in vibrational band frequencies are typically observed upon a change in strength of hydrogen bonding. For a stretching vibration, an increase in hydrogen bond strength typically leads to a downshift in vibrational frequency to lower wavenumbers. Surprisingly, the interaction of Carb with the esterophilic subsite leads to shifts from 1668 and 1605 cm−1 to 1690 and 1620 cm−1, respectively. This could imply either the formation of a hydrogen bond with the ester carbonyl of Carb that is weaker than that observed when the esterophilic subsite is unoccupied or the displacement of a counter ion upon Carb binding. The former interpretation of the data seems unlikely given that the nAChR has a stronger affinity for Carb than TMA. Alternatively, the shifts to higher frequency may reflect more complex vibrational couplings. Model compound studies are required to fully interpret the nature of the band shifts that occur upon the binding of Carb to the esterophilic subsite. FTIR difference spectroscopy provides a spectral map of the vibrational changes that occur in the nAChR upon Carb binding. This map has been used extensively to investigate the conformational states of the nAChR stabilized by a variety of different ligands and upon reconstitution of the receptor into lipid bilayers of varying lipid compositions (14Ryan S.E. Baenziger J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 15Ryan S.E. Blanton M.P. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 777-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that features in the Carb R→D difference spectrum also provide a vibrational map of the physical interactions that occur between the nAChR and Carb. The difference spectrum exhibits bands at frequencies potentially attributable to tyrosine, tryptophan, and carboxylic acid residues, which are all thought to play a role in agonist binding (see below). Several other protein vibrations suggest additional complexity to Carb-nAChR interactions. We have developed a novel double ligand difference method that can be used to isolate the vibrational features from those residues in a large integral membrane receptor that interact physically either directly or indirectly with specific functional groups on a small molecule ligand. The difference between spectra of the nAChR recorded with either Carb or TMA bound to the neurotransmitter binding sites exhibits protein vibrations from only those residues in the esterophilic subsite that interact with the alkyl carbamylester portion of Carb (see below). Additional double ligand difference spectra show that these vibrations reflect residues that interact either directly or indirectly with the ester carbonyl functional group. Two main band shifts from 1690 and 1620 cm−1 to 1668 and 1605 cm−1, respectively, are consistent with the formation of a hydrogen bond between the ester carbonyl of Carb and an arginine side chain. Significantly, these data highlight the utility of the double ligand difference method for dissecting the physical interactions that occur between a large integral membrane receptor and a bound ligand. The relative simplicity of the resulting double ligand difference spectra is significant from a technical perspective. Band overlap in the Carb R→D difference spectrum prevents interpretation of the data in terms of both the identities of the amino acid side chains that are involved in Carb binding and the nature of the Carb-nAChR contacts. In fact, the two main band shifts observed from 1690 and 1620 cm−1 to 1668 and 1605 cm−1, respectively, that occur upon interaction of the ester carbonyl of Carb with the esterophilic subsite are not discernable in either the Carb or TMA R→D difference spectra. The lack of band overlap in the double ligand difference spectrum permits a precise determination of the band frequencies of the protein side chains that interact with the ester carbonyl in both the Carb bound and TMA bound states. The relative simplicity of the spectrum greatly improves the possibility that Carb-minus-TMA difference spectra recorded in2H2O and at different pH values will lead to a definitive assignment of the protein vibrations tentatively attributed here to an arginine residue. The main conclusions regarding the nature of Carb-nAChR interactions derived from this study are the following: 1) The data show that the main physical interactions between Carb and the nAChR arise from interactions between the quaternary amine and the anionic subsite. This conclusion is based on the observation that the majority of features in the Carb R→D difference spectrum attributable to vibrational changes in residues that interact with Carb are also observed in the TMA R→D difference spectrum. Both the FTIR and fluorescence data show that TMA is capable of stabilizing the nAChR in the desensitized state (see “Results”). The demonstrated importance of the quaternary amine in both agonist-nAChR interactions and agonist-induced conformational change is in agreement with electrophysiological studies, which show that TMA is an agonist of the receptor (20Sine S.M. Quiram P. Papanikolaou F. Kreienkamp H.J. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8808-8816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21O'Leary M.E. White M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8360-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2) The difference spectra provide direct evidence that the quaternary amine of Carb interacts with tyrosine residues in the agonist-binding pocket. Carb binding to the nAChR leads to an increase in the vibrational intensity of a band near 1516 cm−1 indicating a change in the structure and/or local environment surrounding one or more tyrosine residues. This increase in tyrosine vibrational intensity is observed upon Carb binding to a desensitized nAChR suggesting that it reflects Carb-tyrosine physical interactions as opposed to a vibrational perturbation associated with the R→D conformational transition. The increase in intensity near 1516 cm−1 is also observed upon TMA binding supporting the assignment of the band to one or more interactions between one or more tyrosines and the quaternary amine functional group. The relative strong intensity of the 1516 cm−1 band firmly establishes a key role for tyrosines in agonist binding in agreement with extensive data obtained using both chemical labeling and site-directed mutagenesis (4Changeux J.P.

Bands potentially attributable to tryptophan and the carboxylate groups of aspartate and/or glutamate may reflect changes in structure and/or local environment surrounding both types of residues upon interaction with Carb, as has been proposed elsewhere (9Czajkowski C.

Other vibrational features, most notably near 1620 cm−1, suggest the involvement of additional amino acid side chains. 4) Finally, positive and negative bands near 1690/1668 cm−1and 1620/1605 cm−1 detected in the Carb-minus-TMA, the Carb-minus-choline, the ACh-minus-TMA, and ACh-minus-choline difference spectra suggest the formation of a hydrogen bond between an esterophilic subsite residue and the ester carbonyl of Carb while the nAChR is in the desensitized state. Although other band assignments are possible, the frequencies are consistent with an arginine side chain interacting directly with the ester carbonyl. An arginine residue is likely located close to the agonist binding pocket (10Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). The ability of the double ligand difference technique to detect specific ligand-receptor contacts highlights the potential of the technique for mapping subtle structural variations that exist between the binding sites of homologous ligand binding proteins. For example, Carb-minus-TMA difference spectra recorded from both the nAChR and the homologous ACh binding protein would reveal similarities and/or differences in amino acid side chains located in the esterophilic subsite. Given that the crystal structure of the ACh binding protein has been solved, such information could prove valuable for modeling the binding site of the nAChR. A similar approach could also be used to investigate the structural basis for the different neuronal nAChR receptor pharmacologies. The experimental approach used here is readily adaptable to almost any membrane-bound receptor. The main requirement is the ability to form a membrane film that adheres to the surface of an internal reflection element in the presence of flowing buffer. In our experience, most biological membranes adhere to germanium internal reflection elements (see also Refs. 24Fahmy K. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W2316795794,"Cells that lack PARP-1 activity are limited in their ability to repair DNA single strand breaks and respond to DNA damage with a strong accumulation of p53 and enhanced rates of apoptotic cell death. We have generated combinatorial mutant mice that both lack p53 and PARP-1 activity due to the expression of a dominant negative PARP-1 allele targeted to T-cells by the lck promoter. Here we report that these double mutant mice develop T-cell lymphoma at a significantly reduced latency period compared to single p53 null mice that are already cancer prone. We demonstrate that the absence of p53 does not only protect T-cells from lck-PARP-DBD transgenic mice from apoptosis but also abrogates the DNA damage induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. T-cells from double mutant mice continue to proliferate after the induction of DNA strand breaks, are limited in their DNA repair capacity and cannot be eliminated by apoptosis. These results indicate that PARP-1 and p53 cooperate in the suppression of tumorigenesis by maintaining genomic integrity after DNA damage through the activation of a G1/S cell cycle checkpoint the initiation of DNA repair and the induction of cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2026425919,"It has been suggested that angiogenin binds to an actin-like molecule present on the surface of endothelial cells. Actin inhibits plasmin activity, but the angiogenin-actin complex is not active. In this report, we found that plasmin inhibits the interaction between angiogenin and actin suggesting a possibility that both angiogenin and plasmin may bind to a similar site on actin. Here we report that chANG, an antiangiogenin peptide that binds to the actin-binding site of angiogenin, inhibits the proteolytic activity of plasmin without any apparent effect on the activities of plasminogen activators and matrix metalloproteases. Its antiplasmin activity is comparable with that of actin. chANG inhibits plasmin activity via its binding to plasmin kringle domains while scrambled chANG does not bind to plasmin. chANG also inhibits the invasion of angiogenin-secreting human fibrosarcoma and colorectal carcinoma cells without effecting migration. Furthermore, chANG blocks angiogenesis induced by fibrosarcoma cells and metastasis of colorectal carcinoma cells to the liver. Therefore, the 11-amino acid peptide chANG has both antiangiogenin and antiplasmin activity, and could be useful in the development of anticancer agents."
https://openalex.org/W2022193577,"As part of an effort to understand the interactions in HbS polymerization, we have produced and studied a recombinant triple mutant, D6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E121R(β), and a quadruple mutant comprising the preceding mutation plus the natural genetic mutation of sickle hemoglobin, E6V(β). These recombinant hemoglobins expressed in yeast were extensively characterized, and their structure and oxygen binding cooperativity were found to be normal. Their tetramer-dimer dissociation constants were within a factor of 2 of HbA and HbS. Polymerization of these mutants mixed with HbS was investigated by a micromethod based on volume exclusion by dextran. The elevated solubility of mixtures of HbS with HbA and HbF in dextran could be accurately predicted without any variable parameters. Relative to HbS, the copolymerization probability of the quadruple mutant/HbS hybrid was found to be 6.2, and the copolymerization probability for the triple mutant/HbS hybrid was 0.52. The pure quadruple mutant had a solubility slightly above that of its hybrid with HbS. One way to explain these results is to require significant cis-trans differences in the polymer and that HbA assemble above 42.5 g/dl. A second way to explain these data is by the modification of motional freedom, thereby changing vibrational entropy in the polymer.

A second way to explain these data is by the modification of motional freedom, thereby changing vibrational entropy in the polymer. Sickle cell disease is due to a single DNA base change encoding for the amino acid at the 6th position of the two β-globin chains of the hemoglobin tetramer. This surface mutation of glutamic acid to valine does not affect the oxygen carrying ability of hemoglobin. However, either one of the valines resulting from this mutation can dock in a strong hydrophobic pocket in the region of Phe-85/Leu-88(β) of an adjacent tetramer. Additional interactions from many other contact sites lead to aggregation of deoxy-Hb tetramers and to eventual sickling of the red cells in the circulation. The aggregates responsible for this pathology are long 14-stranded helical polymers whose structure has been deduced from electron microscopy coupled with model building. These models are based on the linear double strands whose x-ray structure has been determined (1.Wishner B.C. Ward K.B. Lattman E.E. Love W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 179-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 2.Padlan E.A. Love W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8272-8279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Harrington D.L. Adachi K. Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and that have been shown to be constituents of the 14-stranded polymers (4.Nagel R.L. Johnson J. Bookchin R.M. Garel M.C. Rosa J. Schiliro G. Wajcman H. Labie D. Moo-Penn W. Castro O. Nature. 1980; 283: 832-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 5.Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 63-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Interactions of molecules within the 14-stranded structure are complex in many ways. First of all, the existence of two β and two α subunits means that there are two possible regions of interaction for each α or β amino acid when polymers form. Such differences are known as cis-trans differences and were first proposed to explain the unusual behavior of HbC-Harlem (6.Bookchin R.M. Nagel R.L. Ranney H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 248-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, because there are so many different interactions possible within a 14-stranded polymer it is also possible that the interactions are different for the same amino acid in different strands. A proposal utilizing both of the above features has recently been put forward as a way to explain quantitatively the polymerization of HbS/HbA mixtures by having four molecules use the second β6 in a favorable contact (7.Roufberg A. Ferrone F.A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1031-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Third, even when an interaction is identified, the effect of a given amino acid on polymer stability may depend not only on its identity but also on the local environment. For example, it has recently been proposed that the mutation of β88 Leu → Ala increases solubility because of the tightness of fit of the mutation rather than the intrinsic hydrophobicity of the group (8.Cao Z. Liao D. Mirchev R. Martin de Llano J.J. Himanen J.-P. Manning J.M. Ferrone F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Finally, interactions at separate sites may not provide additive stability, even when the sites are physically well separated, as has been seen in a triple mutant involving the β6 sickle mutation plus β88 Leu → Ala and β95 Lys → Ile (9.Himanen J.-P. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Boookchin R.M. Manning J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25152-25156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In short, the interactions within the fiber are sufficiently subtle that it is of paramount importance to learn how different sites are able to contribute to polymer stability to have any hope of a rational approach to designing drugs for the treatment of this disease. In disentangling such issues many strategies are possible, and no single approach is assured of success. In addition to pursuing the known contact sites within the double strand, another fruitful avenue is to expand upon previously known mutants to develop further the detailed knowledge of regions in which some understanding already exists. Recently the systematic study of a series of recombinant sickle hemoglobin tetramers with substitution at one to three sites in addition to β6 has been reported (10.Li X. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Manning J.M. Blood. 1997; 90: 4620-4627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These three mutations (E121R(β), D75Y(α), and D6A(α)) were all chosen because they are known to enhance polymerization (10.Li X. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Manning J.M. Blood. 1997; 90: 4620-4627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Benesch R.E. Kwong S. Edalji R. Benesch R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8169-8172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Milner P.F. Miller C. Grey R. Seakins M. DeJong W.W. Went L.N. N. Eng. J. Med. 1970; 283: 1417-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and yet the locations of the mutations were well separated to attempt to avoid concerted interaction among the sites. Given the enhanced polymer stability brought about by the three mutation sites (E121R(β)/D75Y(α)/D6A(α)), the immediate question was whether the enhancement could overcome the resistance to assembly posed by the presence of Glu at β6. The study of these mutants is all the more interesting because the structural basis of their enhancement is somewhat obscure, using presently accepted models for the HbS polymer (13.Watowich S.J. Gross L.J. Josephs R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14.Watowich S.J. Gross L.J. Josephs R. J. Struct. Biol. 1993; 111: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), despite the fact that some of the mutants have been previously studied. To probe gelation strength in these experiments, solubility was measured in a newly developed assay that replaces an amount of scarce mutant Hb with dextran, thereby crowding the solution and promoting assembly using only small quantities of the hemoglobin mutant (15.Bookchin R. Balazs T. Wang Z. Josephs R. Lew V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6689-6697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). With 12 g/dl dextran, HbS has a solubility of 35.3 mg/ml, the mutant HbS/E121R(β) gels at 24.3 mg/ml, the mutant HbS/E121R(β)/D75Y(α) gels at 11.8 mg/ml, and the quadruple mutant HbS/E121R(β)/D75Y(α)/D6A(α) gels at a mere 7.0 mg/ml. This enhancement of polymerization is consonant with the behavior of these sites in the SAD mouse construct in which the combination of HbS, Hb-Antilles (E23I(β)), and HbD Punjab (E121Q(β)) are expressed to produce an important research tool, i.e. a sickling mouse model (16.Trudel M. Saadane N. Garel M. Bardakdjian-Michau J. Blouquit Y. Guerquin-Kern J. Rouyer-Fessard P. Vidaud D. Pachnis A. Romeo P.H. Beuzard Y. Costantini F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3157-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In previous studies it was found that the solubility of the above quadruple mutant was quite close to the solubility of HbSAD, which is 6.1 mg/ml. A fruitful approach in understanding the behavior of natural mutants has been to study their polymerization when mixed with HbS. This permits their hybridization by the spontaneous dissociation of the hemoglobin tetramer into its constituent dimers (4.Nagel R.L. Johnson J. Bookchin R.M. Garel M.C. Rosa J. Schiliro G. Wajcman H. Labie D. Moo-Penn W. Castro O. Nature. 1980; 283: 832-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This approach is applicable here since, as we show, the tetramer-dimer dissociation constants of the recombinant mutants are close to that of HbS. Particularly when the hybrids can be compared with the simultaneous presence of all the sites, the important cis-trans issues can be explored. In this work we report the polymerization of a triple mutant (α6, α75, and β121) in hybrids with HbS. We contrast this with the polymerization of a quadruple mutant (the triple mutant plus the β6 mutation of HbS) mixed with HbS. By determining solubilities at a variety of fractional mixtures, the adequacy of the description of the mixtures can be tested, and the relative probability of copolymerization can be determined. The latter is directly related to the free energy difference of the hybrid relative to HbS.

The DNA sequencing kit and the PCR reagent kit were obtained from United States Biochemical Corp. The Geneclean kit was from BIO 101, Inc. The plasmid kit was from Qiagen.

DNA sequence analysis established that the resulting recombinant plasmid had the three desired mutations. The base changes encoding the Asp-6(α)→ Ala, Asp-75(α) → Tyr, and Glu-121(β) → Arg were the only mutations of the α- and β-globin gene for each mutant. The α and β cassette was then excised as a NotI fragment and inserted into the NotI site of pGS389 to give the recombinant plasmid pGS389D6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E121R(β). Recombinant pGS389D6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E121R(β) was transformed intoSaccharomyces cerevisiae GSY112 ciro strain using the lithium acetate method described previously (17.Martin de Llano J.J. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1206-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The transformants were selected using a complete medium first without uracil and then without uracil and leucine. To express the D6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E121R(β) triple mutant, the yeast strain was grown in 12 liters of yeast extract plus peptone medium in a New Brunswick Fermentor Bioflo IV for 3 days using ethanol as a carbon source. The promoter controlling the transcription of the globin genes was induced for 20 h by adding galactose (Pfanstiehl or United States Biochemical Corp., containing <0.1% glucose) to a final concentration of 3%. The collection and breakage of the cells after bubbling with CO gas and purification have been described previously (17.Martin de Llano J.J. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1206-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE of the recombinant mutants was performed on the Phast System from Amersham Biosciences. The protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Isoelectric focusing was performed on the pH 7–10 Hb-Resolve system from Isolab. The α- and β-globin chains from recombinant hemoglobins were separated by reverse phase HPLC on a Vydac C4 column with a gradient of 20–60% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Amino acid analysis of globin chains isolated by this procedure was performed on a Beckman 6300 instrument with a System Gold data handling system. The spectrum of each mutant was recorded on a Shimadzu 1601 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Electrospray mass spectrometric analysis of the purified recombinant mutant Hb tetramers was performed with a Finnigan-MAT TSQ-700 triple quadruple mass spectrometer as described previously (10.Li X. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Manning J.M. Blood. 1997; 90: 4620-4627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oxygen binding curves of the hemoglobins were determined at 37 °C on a modified Hem-O-Scan instrument (Aminco). Before the measurements, the purified Hb sample was dialyzed in 50 mm bis-Tris, pH 7. 5, and converted to the oxy form. These samples were concentrated using CentriPrep, Centricon, and MicroCon ultrafiltration devices (10,000 molecular weight cut-off, Amicon) to a final concentration of 0.6 mm. To measure the effect of anions on the oxygen affinity of these hemoglobin mutants, an aliquot of a solution of 5.6 mm DPG or 2.5 m NaCl in 50 mm bis-Tris, pH 7.5, was added to the Hb sample to achieve the desired final concentration. The gelation concentration of the hemoglobin mutants or hemoglobin mixtures was determined by the “Dextran-Csat” micromethod as described previously (15.Bookchin R. Balazs T. Wang Z. Josephs R. Lew V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6689-6697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The concentrated hemoglobin sample in the oxy form in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, was mixed with dextran at a final concentration of 120 mg/ml. Mineral oil was layered on top, and fresh sodium dithionite solution (50 mm final concentration) was added anaerobically below the Hb/dextran mixture using a gas-tight syringe. After stirring and incubation for 30 min in a 37 °C water bath, the resulting gel under the oil layer was disrupted with a narrow wire loop, and the tubes were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 30 min. The clear supernatant was carefully separated from the aggregated Hb, and the hemoglobin concentration was measured spectrophotometrically and verified by amino acid analysis after acid hydrolysis of an aliquot. The analysis uses a small modification of the extensively used copolymerization theory (5.Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 63-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 18.Minton A.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 100: 519-542Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The solubility observed, cs, is related to the solubility of pure HbS, denoted cso. Because of reproportionation among the subunits, if the additive species is a fraction X of total molecules, then, (1 −X)2 are pure HbS molecules, 2X(1 − X) are hybrids, and X2 are pure tetramers of the additive species. These fractions are denotedX1, X2, andX3, respectively. Each of these species copolymerizes with a probability denoted ei, which is related to the free energy difference between having HbS polymerized and the ith species polymerized. By this definition, copolymerization probability e2 is identically 1 for the case of hypothetical “hybrids” of HbS with HbS, i.e. HbS mixed with itself. Then using Equations 22–25 of Eaton and Hofrichter (5.Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 63-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) it is straightforward to show that if co is the initial concentration,cp is the concentration of the pure polymer,v is the specific volume of the monomer,cx is the concentration of the dextran, andvx is the specific volume of the dextran, then(cp−cs)co ∑i=13 Xieiei(co−cs)cp+Γcso(cp−co)=1Equation 1 in which Γ is an activity coefficient ratio given byΓ=γsoγs exp∫csocs 1/cp−v1−vxcx−vc1+∂lnγ∂lncdcEquation 2 where γs is the activity coefficient of the monomers at solubility, and γsois the activity coefficient of monomers at cso. The expression for Γ has been modified from that used in the footnote to Table III.2 of Eaton and Hofrichter (5.Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 63-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) to include the volume exclusion due to the dextran in which the solubility is measured. The volume of the dextran molecules has been taken here as 0.664 ml/mg as measured directly by Bookchinet al. (15.Bookchin R. Balazs T. Wang Z. Josephs R. Lew V. J. Biol.

Activity coefficients are calculated based on scaled particle theory, described by Minton (19.Minton A.P. Biopolymers. 1981; 20: 2093-2120Crossref Scopus (468) Google Scholar), using the volumes described above and assuming spherical particles. Because the first equation cannot be simply inverted to give an expression ofcs, it is solved numerically.Table IIIFunctional properties of natural HbS and recombinant hemoglobin mutantsHbAdditiveP50nD6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E6V(β)/E121R(β)3-aValues from Ref.10.052.81.2 mm DPG92.80.5 mNaCl72.8D6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E121R(β)062.81.2 mm DPG112.70.5 mNaCl82.73-a Values from Ref.10.Li X.

Blood. 1997; 90: 4620-4627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This measurement was performed on the CO-liganded recombinant hemoglobins on a Superose-12:HR 10/30 column using an Amersham Biosciences FPLC system (20.Manning L. Jenkins W.T. Hess J.R. Vandegriff K. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The absorbance of the eluent was measured at 405 nm with the Amersham Biosciences on-line mercury lamp detection system with a 5-mm flow cell. For the double mutant E6V(β)/E121R(β),Kd was calculated as described previously using the parameters (Vd and Vt) that were determined from the standard dimeric Hb Rothschild and tetrameric cross-linked Hb (20.Manning L. Jenkins W.T. Hess J.R. Vandegriff K. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For recombinant mutants D75Y(α)/E6V(β)/E121R(β), D6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E6V(β)/E12lR(β), and D6A(α)ID75Y(α)/E121R(β), the elution volume (V) at low or high concentrations was not within the standards presumably due to the interaction of their strong positive charges with Superose-12 column. Thus, their Kd values were calculated by curve fitting the experimental volume data allowingVd/Vt to vary (10.Li X. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Manning J.M. Blood. 1997; 90: 4620-4627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant mutant D6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E121R(β) lacking the sickle mutation was expressed in yeast and purified by CM-cellulose 52 chromatography (9.Himanen J.-P. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Boookchin R.M.

Its purity was verified by chromatography on an Amersham Biosciences FPLC Mono S column. It showed one band upon isoelectric focusing in the pH 6–8 Hb-Resolve system from Isolab, and its migration was consistent with the loss of four negative charges per αβ subunit compared with HbA (Asp → Ala and Asp → Tyr) and a substitution equivalent to the loss of two negative charges (Glu → Arg) (Fig. 1). By SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, it showed a single band at 16 kDa in the same position as the denatured subunits of HbA and HbS. The purified recombinant HbS mutants were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC using a denaturing solvent to separate the globin chains (Fig. 2). The β-chain containing a substitution of Arg for Glu at β121 eluted at 30.5 min ahead of the normal β-chain from HbA (35.0 min). The elution position of the α-chain from D6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E121R(β) coincided with the α-chain from natural HbA (43.2 and 42.7 min, respectively), indicating that the replacement of the hydrophilic residue Asp at the α-chain by nonpolar amino acids Ala and Tyr does not alter their chromatographic behavior significantly on the reverse phase C4 column. Amino acid analysis of each isolated subunit gave the expected composition (Table I). For the mutated β-chain containing Glu-121(β) → Arg and mutated α-chain containing Asp-6(α) → Ala and Asp-75(α) → Tyr, the values for Arg, Glu, Asp, and Ala were in reasonable accord with theoretical values. The values for the other amino acids were also in good agreement with the known composition of this mutant.Table IAmino acid analysis of the α- and β-globin chains of non-HbS triple mutant D6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E121R(β)Amino acidFoundTheoryα-Chainβ-Chainα-Chainβ-ChainAsx9.412.31013Thr8.07.497Ser9.15.4115Glx6.211.1510Gly8.413.6713Ala20.715.12215Cys0.30.312Val13.917.11318Met0021Ile0.30.400Leu18.018.01818Tyr0.20.743Phe7.07.978His10.18.7109Lys11.511.51010Trp0012Arg2.53.234Pro8.08.077The value found for Leu was set at the theoretical value of 18.0 and used to normalize the values for the other amino acids.

For amino acids underlined, there are significant differences between the amounts in the α- and β-chains. Mass spectrometric analysis of the mutant D6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E121R(β) by the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry method gave the expected mass for both α and β subunits. The molecular mass of the β-chain containing Glu-121(β) → Arg agreed with the expected mass. The mass difference from the sickle β-chain was within experimental error of the expected difference of 27 Da between a Glu (129 mass units) and an Arg (156 mass units). The measured molecular mass for the α-chain of D6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E121R(β) was also consistent with the calculated value within experimental error. The circular dichroism spectra of the recombinant hemoglobins including natural HbA, E6V(β)/E121R(β), D6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E6V(β)/E121R(β), and D6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E121R(β) in liganded forms were analyzed and compared with that of HbA (Fig. 3). In the far ultraviolet region from 200 to 250 nm, comparison of all five spectra indicated that their CD profiles were practically identical showing that no change occurred in helical content and showing that there were no adverse effects of the mutations on their secondary structures. In the Soret region, the maximum ellipticity at 414 nm was identical to that of HbA. The minor differences at 412 nm observed between the individual Hbs were no greater than the differences between the natural HbA and HbS. Thus, the overall features of these CD curves are identical to those of native HbA, indicating no adverse effects on the heme pocket by the amino acid replacements. Since these recombinant hemoglobin mutants have quite different surface charges than HbA and HbS, their tetramer-dimer dissociation was investigated. The two other previously reported recombinant HbS hemoglobins, E6V(β)/E121R(β) and D75Y(α)/E6V(β)/E121R(β), were also included for comparison. For the double mutant E6V(β)/E121R(β),Kd was calculated using the GraFit program as described previously (20.Manning L. Jenkins W.T. Hess J.R. Vandegriff K. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) using the parameters (Vdand Vt) that were determined from the standard dimeric Hb Rothschild and tetrameric cross-linked Hb (Fig. 4A). The Kd values of the double and triple mutants were calculated by curve fitting the experimental volume data, allowing Vd/Vt to vary (Fig. 4, B–D) (20.Manning L. Jenkins W.T. Hess J.R. Vandegriff K. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As shown in Table II, the tetramer-dimer dissociation constants for the liganded recombinants were in the range of 0.3–1.0 μm, which are the same within experimental error for native HbS (Kd = 0.4 μm) (Table II). These results show that the amino acid replacements in all these recombinants have no significant effect on the dissociation behaviors at the α1β2 interfaces in the liganded hemoglobins.Table IITetramer-dimer dissociation constantsHemoglobinKdHbA0.68 ± 0.052-aValues from Ref.28.E6V(β) (HbS)0.42 ± 0.032-bValues from Ref.20.E6V(β)/E121R(β)1.04 ± 0.112-cCalculated using the parameters (Vd and Vt) that were determined from the standard dimeric Hb Rothschild and tetrameric cross-linked Hb.D75Y(α)/E6V(β)/E121R(β)0.31 ± 0.072-dCalculated by curve fitting the experimental volume data withVd/Vt allowed to vary.D6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E6V(β)/E121R(β)0.35 ± 0.042-dCalculated by curve fitting the experimental volume data withVd/Vt allowed to vary.D6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E121R(β)0.69 ± 0.242-dCalculated by curve fitting the experimental volume data withVd/Vt allowed to vary.2-a Values from Ref.28.Dumoulin A.

Open table in a new tab The oxygen binding properties of the mutant D6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E121R(β) were determined at a hemoglobin concentration of 0.6 mm (Table III). Its P50 is 6 mm Hg with a Hill's coefficient (n) value of 2.8 compared with a value of 5 mm Hg and n = 2.8 for D6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E6V(β)/E121R(β). The effect of DPG (at a 2:1 ratio to Hb) on D6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E121R(β) was comparable to that on D6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E6V(β)/E121R(β) under the same conditions with a 2-fold higher value of P50. The D6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E121R(β) shows a somewhat decreased response to chloride similar to that of D6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E6V(β)/E121R(β). These results suggest that the replacement of the amino acid from Glu to Val at β6 of D6A(α)/D75Y(α)/E6V(β)/E121R(β) does not affect the oxygen affinity. The mixtures of HbS with HbF and HbA provide valuable control experiments for analysis using the dextran assay as employed here. HbF does not polymerize of its own (i.e. e3 = 0) nor does it copolymerize (i.e. e2= 0). This allows the solubility data for the HbS/HbF mixtures to be compared with a prediction from the theory since there are no unknown paramet"
https://openalex.org/W1966859761,"Cytokine oncostatin M (OM) exerts growth-inhibitory and differentiative effects on breast cancer cells. Previously we showed that the transcription from the p53 gene in breast cancer cells was down regulated by OM. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the OM effect on p53 transcription, in this study, we dissected the p53 promoter region and analysed the p53 promoter activity in breast tumor cells. We showed that treatment of MCF-7 cells with OM induced a dose- and time-dependent suppression of p53 promoter activity. The p53 promoter activity was decreased to 35% of control at 24 h and further decreased to 20% at 48 h by OM at concentrations of 5 ng/ml and higher. Deletion of the 5'-flanking region of the p53 promoter from -426 to -97 did not affect the OM effect. However, further deletion to -40 completely abolished the repressive effect of OM. The p53 promoter region -96 to -41 contains NF-kappaB and c-myc binding sites, and a newly identified UV-inducible element PE21. Mutations to disrupt NF-kappaB binding or c-myc binding to the p53 promoter decreased the basal promoter activity without affecting the OM-mediated suppression, whereas mutation at the PE21 motif totally abolished the OM effect. We further demonstrated that insertion of PE21 element upstream of the thymidine kinase minimal promoter generated an OM response analogous to that of the p53 promoter. Finally, we detected the specific binding of a nuclear protein with a molecular mass of 87 kDa to the PE21 motif. Taken together, we demonstrate that OM inhibits the transcription of the p53 gene through the PE21 element. Thus, the PE21 element is functionally involved in p53 transcription regulated by UV-induction and OM suppression."
