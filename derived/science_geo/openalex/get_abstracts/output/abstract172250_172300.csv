https://openalex.org/W2009077913,"Light synchronizes mammalian circadian rhythms with environmental time by modulating retinal input to the circadian pacemaker-the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Such photic entrainment requires neither rods nor cones, the only known retinal photoreceptors. Here, we show that retinal ganglion cells innervating the SCN are intrinsically photosensitive. Unlike other ganglion cells, they depolarized in response to light even when all synaptic input from rods and cones was blocked. The sensitivity, spectral tuning, and slow kinetics of this light response matched those of the photic entrainment mechanism, suggesting that these ganglion cells may be the primary photoreceptors for this system."
https://openalex.org/W2035853180,"The primary circadian pacemaker, in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the mammalian brain, is photoentrained by light signals from the eyes through the retinohypothalamic tract. Retinal rod and cone cells are not required for photoentrainment. Recent evidence suggests that the entraining photoreceptors are retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that project to the SCN. The visual pigment for this photoreceptor may be melanopsin, an opsin-like protein whose coding messenger RNA is found in a subset of mammalian RGCs. By cloning rat melanopsin and generating specific antibodies, we show that melanopsin is present in cell bodies, dendrites, and proximal axonal segments of a subset of rat RGCs. In mice heterozygous for tau-lacZ targeted to the melanopsin gene locus, β-galactosidase–positive RGC axons projected to the SCN and other brain nuclei involved in circadian photoentrainment or the pupillary light reflex. Rat RGCs that exhibited intrinsic photosensitivity invariably expressed melanopsin. Hence, melanopsin is most likely the visual pigment of phototransducing RGCs that set the circadian clock and initiate other non–image-forming visual functions."

It is now clear that HSP can and do exit mammalian cells, interact with cells of the immune system, and exert immunoregulatory effects. We recently demonstrated that exogenously added HSP70 possesses potent cytokine activity, with the ability to bind with high affinity to the plasma membrane, elicit a rapid intracellular Ca2+ flux, activate NF-κB, and up-regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in human monocytes. Here for the first time, we report that HSP70-induced proinflammatory cytokine production is mediated via the MyD88/IRAK/NF-κB signal transduction pathway and that HSP70 utilizes both TLR2 (receptor for Gram-positive bacteria) and TLR4 (receptor for Gram-negative bacteria) to transduce its proinflammatory signal in a CD14-dependent fashion. These studies now pave the way for the development of highly effective pharmacological or molecular tools that will either up-regulate or suppress HSP70-induced functions in conditions where HSP70 effects are desirable (cancer) or disorders where HSP70 effects are undesirable (arthritis and arteriosclerosis).

Innate immunity is the first line of host defense against infection and malignant transformation and has a profound effect on the establishment of adaptive immunity (1.Fearon D.T. Locksley R.M. Science. 1996; 272: 50-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar, 2.Medzhitov R. Janeway C.A.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). Cells of the innate immune system are adorned with recognition structures called pattern recognition receptors (2.Medzhitov R. Janeway C.A.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar, 3.Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4458) Google Scholar). Pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), 1The abbreviations used are: TLRToll-like receptorIRAKIL-1R-associated kinaseLPSlipopolysaccharideHSPheat shock proteinILinterleukinDNdominant negativeTNF-αtumor necrosis factor-α[3H]TdR[3H]methylthymidineOVAovalbuminDCdendritic cell CD14, β2-integrins (CD11/CD18), complement receptors (CR1/CD35), and C-type lectins are expressed either as soluble proteins or plasma membrane-bound proteins that recognize invariant molecular structures called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (e.g. LPS, peptidoglycan, unmethylated CpG DNA, bacterial lipoprotein, and mannans of yeast), that are shared by numerous pathogens but are not normally expressed on host tissues (2.Medzhitov R. Janeway C.A.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). Recent studies on the recognition of microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns have highlighted the central role played by one group of pattern recognition receptors, the TLR, in pathogen recognition and host defense (see review in Refs. 4.Anderson K.V. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 5.Janeway C.A.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R879-R882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Zhang G. Ghosh S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). TLRs are similar in sequence and structure to the Drosophila Toll protein and they share a conserved extracellular leucine-rich region important for ligand binding. Both Toll and TLRs are type 1 transmembrane proteins whose intracellular signaling domains have a Toll/IL-lR homology motif (7.Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2632) Google Scholar, 8.Kopp E.B. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 9.Rock F.L.

Toll was originally identified as an essential component of dorsal-ventral development in flies, and has since been linked to an immune response against fungal infection in adult flies (10.Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3020) Google Scholar, 11.Muzio M. Mantovani A. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The mammalian homologues of Toll also control innate immune responses through conserved signaling pathways. An adapter protein, MyD88, binds to a receptor Toll/IL-lR-domain through its own Toll/IL-lR motif, while a death domain on its C terminus recruits IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK) to the complex. IRAK is then autophosphorylated, and released from the complex to bind TRAF6, which can then activate either the NF-κB pathway or the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (8.Kopp E.B. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The TLR family is a fast growing family whose ligands have not all been identified. The most well characterized TLRs are TLR2 and TLR4. TLR4 initiates signaling cascades in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the abundant glycolipid of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, Taxol, or HSP60, while TLR2 initiates the signal cascade in response to Gram-positive bacteria, Mycoplasma, Yeast, and Spirochetes. Toll-like receptor IL-1R-associated kinase lipopolysaccharide heat shock protein interleukin dominant negative tumor necrosis factor-α [3H]methylthymidine ovalbumin dendritic cell Heat shock proteins (HSP) are highly conserved proteins found in all prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Under normal physiological conditions HSP are expressed at low levels (12.Craig E.A. Gross C.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). However, a wide variety of stressful stimuli including environmental (UV radiation, heat shock, heavy metals, and amino acids), pathological (viral, bacterial, parasitic infections or fever, inflammation, malignancy, or autoimmunity), or physiological stimuli (growth factors, cell differentiation, hormonal stimulation, or tissue development), induce a marked increase in intracellular HSP synthesis (13.Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4438) Google Scholar), known as the stress response. The primary function ascribed to HSP is as intracellular molecular chaperones of naı̈ve, aberrantly folded, or mutated proteins as well as in cytoprotection following the kinds of stressful stimuli mentioned above. Recent findings showing that both HSP60 (14.Ohashi K. Burkart V. Flohe S. Kolb H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar) and HSP70 (15.Asea A. Kraeft S.K.

In addition, we show that TLR2 and TLR4 synergize to greatly augment HSP70-induced cytokine production. The physiological relevance of extracellular HSP70s ability to synergistically activate proinflammatory cytokine production helps elucidate recent findings indicating that HSP70 is a potent adjuvant for eliciting immune responses and a powerful inducer of anti-tumor immunity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from freshly drawn peripheral venous blood (Kraft Family Blood Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute) using the Ficoll-Paque separation technique as described in detail elsewhere (17.Asea A. The Role of Histamine in the Regulation of Natural Killer Cells Doctoral dissertation. University of Göteborg, Göteborg, Sweden1995Google Scholar). Monocytes were enriched from the peripheral blood mononuclear cell fraction by negative depletion using magnetic beads coated with appropriate monoclonal antibodies. Briefly, using a monocyte isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Aubum, CA), peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with FcR blocking agent followed by hapten-antibody mixture containing monoclonal hapten-conjugated CD3 (mouse Ig2A), CD7 (mouse Ig2A), CD19 (mouse IgG1), CD45RA (mouse IgG1), CD56 (mouse IgG2b), and anti-IgE (mouse IgG2A) antibodies and incubated for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in FcR blocking buffer and MACs anti-hapten microbeads. After a 5-min incubation at 4 °C, cells were washed and passed through a column attached to a magnet. Unlabeled monocytes (CD45+CD14+) eluted from the column were >98% pure, as judged by flow cytometry. Cell viability was measured by Trypan blue exclusion. CD45+CD14+ monocytes were cultured for 8 days in RPMI (supplemented with 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% autologous serum). To generate DC, cells were treated with granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (500 units/ml) and IL-4 (800 units/ml) on day 0. On day 4 of culture, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor was added to the cells. HEK293 cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine, and 2% sodium bicarbonate. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air humidified incubator. At ∼70–90% confluence, cells were harvested using trypsin-EDTA, washed, and counted using a hemocytometer. Cells were grown in this fashion for no more than 10 passages. Mutations corresponding to the dominant negative TLR4 (P712H substitution) in C3H/HeJ-mice were introduced into hemaggultinin-tagged cDNAs of human TLR2 and TLR4 (kindly provided by Felix Randow) by PCR-directed mutagenesis, sequenced, and subcloned into the expression plasmid pRc/CMV (Invitrogen). Transient transfection of HEK293 (293 wild type), 293-TLR2, 293-TLR4, or 293-TLR2+4 cells was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) transfection reagent following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were incubated with plasmids containing 1 μg of NF-κB reporter luciferase plasmid and, to correct for differences in transfection efficiency, each group of cells was transfected with 90 ng of pSV40/LACZ and co-transfected with either 1 μg of CD14 or 1 μg of TLR2DN or 1 μg of TLR4DN or 3 μg of MyD88DN or 3 μg of empty vector and incubated overnight. The ratio of luciferase activity to β-galactosidase activity in each sample served as a measure of normalized luciferase activity. Following the various treatment protocols, cell extracts were prepared for determination of luciferase activity using enhanced luciferase assay reagents (Analytical Luminescence) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase assays were performed on a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence) for 20 s and results are expressed as the ratio of luciferase to β-galactosidase and are the mean ± S.D. of experiments performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Following treatment, 2 × 106 cells were simultaneously fixed and permeabilized using 2 ml of PermeaFix (OrthoDiagnostics, Raritan, NJ) for 40 min at room temperature in the dark, as previously described. Cells were then washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline. Nonspecific binding was inhibited by treating cells with 5.5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for an additional 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking. For the measurement of co-stimulatory molecule expression, cells were treated with anti-human CD86-α-PE or anti-human MHCII (1 μl/106 cells; BD PharMingen, Mountain View, CA) for 40 min at room temperature in the dark. Cells were then washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed by flow cytometry. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a FACScan with Lysis II software program (BD PharMingen). Individual cells were gated on the basis of forward (FSC) and orthogonal scatter (SSC). The photomultiplier for fluorescein isothiocyanate (FL1-height) or PE (FL2-height) was set on a logarithmic scale. Cell debris was excluded by raising the FSC-height PMT threshold. The flow rate was adjusted to <200 cells/s and at least 10,000 cells were analyzed for each sample. To determine the amount of proliferation, following the various treatment protocols the cells were pulsed with [3H]methylthymidine ([3H]TdR; specific activity 2 Ci/mol; PerkinElmer Life Science, Beverly, MA) for 8 h. When incubated with rapidly proliferating cells, [3H]TdR incorporates into the DNA. The amount of cellular incorporation of [3H]TdR is then estimated by liquid scintillography. We (15.Asea A.

Among the proinflammatory cytokines induced by HSP70 interaction with human monocytes, we identified IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α (15.Asea A. Kraeft S.K. Kurt-Jones E.A. Stevenson M.A. Chen L.B.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). IL-1β has been shown to be produced following interaction at the surface membrane by complex formation between extracellular IL-1 and the transmembrane IL-1R type I (IL-1R1) and IL-1R accessory proteins (IL-1RAcP) (reviewed in Ref. 20.Auron P.E. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The resulting intracellular signaling cascade recruits two IRAK, IRAK1 and IRAK2, and an adapter protein MyD88 (21.Jensen L.E. Muzio M. Mantovani A. Whitehead A.S. J.

Cell. 1998; 2: 253-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar), signal through the MyD88/IRAK-NF-κB signal transduction pathway. To test whether recombinant HSP70-induced signaling cascade occurs via a similar pathway, THP1 monocytic cells were treated with various concentrations of HSP70 and NF-κB promoter activity was measured using a κB-luciferase reporter construct after 2 h incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 1). HSP70 dose dependently increased NF-κB promoter activity in THP1 monocytic cells (Fig. 1). Control protein OVA used at equimolar concentrations did not up-regulate NF-κB promoter activity significantly above background levels (Fig. 1). HSP70 at a concentration of 0.1 μg/ml resulted in submaximal activation of NF-κB promoter activity, and unless otherwise stated, was the concentration we used in subsequent experiments. Luciferase activity was observed at Hsp70 concentrations as low as 0.01 μg/ml (0.14 nm). To determine the mechanism by which HSP70 activates the signal cascade that results in the activation of NF-κB promoter activity, we used HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells do not express IL-1R, CD14, or TLR. For these studies, we generated HEK293 cells that stably express IL-1R (293-IL-1R), TLR2 (293-TLR2), and TLR4 (293-TLR4). LPS (0.1 μg/ml) but not Hsp70 (0.1 μg/ml) activated NF-κB promoter activity in 293-TLR4 cells (Fig. 2). However, HSP70-induced NF-κB promoter activity was strongly restored in 293-TLR4 cells transiently transfected with CD14 to a level comparable with LPS-induced NF-κB promoter activation (Fig. 2). This is in line with our previous findings in which we demonstrated that HSP70 stimulates proinflammatory cytokine production in a CD14-dependant fashion (15.Asea A. Kraeft S.K. Kurt-Jones E.A. Stevenson M.A. Chen L.B. Finberg R.W. Koo G.C. Calderwood S.K. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of 293-TLR4 cells with CD14 and the dominant negative MyD88 (MyD88DN) completely abrogated HSP70-induced and LPS-induced NF-κB promoter activity (Fig. 2). To rule out bacterial contamination of HSP70, we preincubated 293-TLR4 cells with Polymyxin B, a potent LPS inhibitor (28.Golenbock D.T. Hampton R.Y. Qureshi N. Takayama K. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19490-19498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Duff G.W. Atkins E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1982; 52: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Preincubation of 293-TLR4 cells with Polymyxin B (10 μm) 30–60 min before activation abrogated LPS-induced but not HSP70-induced NF-κB promoter activity (Fig. 2). As an additional control, boiling HSP70 at 100 °C for 1 h completely abrogated HSP70-induced, but not LPS-induced NF-κB promoter activity (data not shown). Furthermore, HSP70 but not LPS induced a rapid intracellular Ca2+ flux in monocytes (15.Asea A. Kraeft S.K. Kurt-Jones E.A. Stevenson M.A. Chen L.B. Finberg R.W. Koo G.C. Calderwood S.K. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that HSP70-induced NF-κB activity is dependant on CD14 to signal through TLR4, which initiates a signal cascade that is transduced via MyD88 (Fig. 2). As an additional control to demonstrate that HSP70-induced signaling specifically occurs through TLR4 and CD14, we used HEK293 cells stably transfected with IL-1R (293-IL-1R). We hypothesized that if the HSP70 signaling cascade is specific, HSP70 will not activate NF-κB promoter activity in 293-IL-1R. This is because, although both IL-1β and TLR transduce signals via the Toll/IL-lR domain in a MyD88/IRAK/TRAF6-NF-κB signaling pathway, the external surface receptors for IL-1R and TLR are different. As expected, IL-1β but not HSP70 activated NF-κB promoter activity in 293-IL-1R cells (Fig. 3). For additional specificity, IL-1β-induced NF-κB promoter activity was abrogated in 293-IL1R cells transiently transfected with MyD88DN (Fig. 3). Taken together these results show that the external receptor for HSP70 is not the IL-1R and that extracellular HSP70 cannot directly interact with molecules downstream of TLR or IL-1R.Figure 3Extracellular HSP70 does not signal through IL-1R. HEK293 wild type (open bars) or HEK293-IL-1R cells (filled bars) were transfected with 1 μg of IL-1 reporter luciferase plasmid alone or co-transfected with 3 μg of MyD88DN or CD14 or empty vector.

To our surprise, stimulation of 293-TLR2 cells co-transfected with CD14 with HSP70 (0.1 μg/ml) induced potent NF-κB promoter activity to a level equivalent to 293-TLR4 cells co-transfected with CD14 (Fig. 4). To confirm that HSP70 was indeed signaling through TLR2 and CD14, we pretreated 293-TLR2 cells with anti-TLR2 before stimulation with HSP70. Pretreatment of 293-TLR2 cells with anti-TLR2 completely abrogated HSP70-induced NF-κB promoter activity in HEK293-TLR2, but not HEK293-TLR4 cells (Fig. 4). We then asked the question as to what kind of signaling would occur if both TLR2 and TLR4 were expressed on the surface of HEK293 cells. Therefore, HEK293 cells were generated that stably expressed both TLR2 and TLR4 (293-TLR2+4). Treatment of 293-TLR2+4 with HSP70 resulted in the synergistic activation of NF-κB promoter activity in a CD14-dependant fashion (Fig. 5). The HSP70-induced NF-κB promoter activity was only partially inhibited by co-transfection of 293-TLR2+4 with dominant negative TLR2 (TLR2DN) or dominant negative TLR4 (TLR4DN) (Fig. 5). Co-transfection of 293-TLR2+4 with both TLR2DN and TLR4DN completely abrogated HSP70-induced CD14-dependent NF-κB promoter activity (Fig. 5). On the other hand, co-transfection of 293-TLR2+4 with CD14 plus MyD88DN only partially inhibited HSP70-induced NF-κB promoter activity (Fig. 6). It has recently been suggested that although TLR4 might act as a homodimer, TLR2 cannot form functional homodimers and acts only in combination with selected TLR proteins, forming heterodimers with, for example, TLR1 and TLR6 (30.Heldwein K.A. Goldenbock D.T. Fenton M.J. Mod. Asp. Immunobiol. 2001; 1: 249-252Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that a combination of TLR2 and TLR4 plus CD14 triggers HSP70-induced MyD88-independent signaling and implies that TRL2 can form functional homodimers as well as functional heterodimers with TLR4 for HSP70-induced signaling.Figure 5Exogenous HSP70 synergistically augments NF-κB promoter activity in HEK293 cells expressing both TLR2 and TLR4.

Rothman J.E. Houghton A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3485-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that extracellular HSP70 induces potent cytokine production in human monocytes via interaction with CD14. These findings suggest that HSPs may not only serve as a vehicle for antigenic peptides but also as a “danger signal” to the innate and specific immune system as suggested for other endogenous activators of antigen presenting cells (31.Matzinger P. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Once activated, mature antigen presenting cells display their full co-stimulatory potential and are able to communicate very effectively with naive T-helper lymphocytes and prime cytotoxic T lymphocytes to mount potent and effective adaptive immune responses. Therefore, we investigated whether HSP70 was able to deliver a maturation signal to DCs. Human DCs were generated in vitro from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from freshly drawn peripheral venous blood and incubated with granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor as previously described (32.Inaba K. Witmer-Pack M. Inaba M. Hathcock K.S. Sakuta H. Azuma M. Yagita H. Okumura K. Linsley P.S. Ikehara S. Muramatsu S. Hodes R.J. Steinman R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1849-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Treatment of human DCs with HSP70 and LPS augmented pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1β, IL-12, and TNF-α production, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Table I). To exclude the possibility that this effect was due to contamination of the protein preparation by endotoxins such as LPS, boiling (100 °C, 1 h) HSP70 abrogated cytokine production, whereas LPS-induced cytokine production was not significantly abrogated by boiling (Table I). The ability of antigen presenting cells to induce an immune response depends both on the regulated expression of cytokines, which act directly on T lymphocytes and on the up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules on DCs (32.Inaba K. Witmer-Pack M. Inaba M. Hathcock K.S. Sakuta H. Azuma M. Yagita H. Okumura K. Linsley P.S. Ikehara S. Muramatsu S. Hodes R.J. Steinman R.M. J. Exp.

In line with these findings, intact HSP70 and LPS, but not boiled HSP70, up-regulated the expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD86 (B7.2) and myosin heavy chain class II on human DCs, as determined by flow cytometric analysis (Table I). Treatment of irradiated immature DCs with HSP70 resulted in augmentation in proliferation of T lymphocytes 7–8-fold greater than in T lymphocytes incubated with irradiated immature DCs treated with either boiled HSP70 or control protein OVA, as determined after 5 days by incorporation of [3H]TdR (data not shown). Proliferation of mature DCs was significantly lower as compared with immature DCs in response to stimulation with intact HSP70 and LPS or boiled LPS (Table I). T"

In a study of 54 families with autosomal dominantly inherited adult-onset POAG, we identified the causative gene on chromosome 10p14 and designated it OPTN (for ""optineurin""). Sequence alterations in OPTN were found in 16.7% of families with hereditary POAG, including individuals with normal intraocular pressure. The OPTN gene codes for a conserved 66-kilodalton protein of unknown function that has been implicated in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha signaling pathway and that interacts with diverse proteins including Huntingtin, Ras-associated protein RAB8, and transcription factor IIIA. Optineurin is expressed in trabecular meshwork, nonpigmented ciliary epithelium, retina, and brain, and we speculate that it plays a neuroprotective role."

The molecular mechanisms underlying the specificity of methylation are unknown. We report here that the leukemia-promoting PML-RAR fusion protein induces gene hypermethylation and silencing by recruiting DNA methyltransferases to target promoters and that hypermethylation contributes to its leukemogenic potential. Retinoic acid treatment induces promoter demethylation, gene reexpression, and reversion of the transformed phenotype. These results establish a mechanistic link between genetic and epigenetic changes during transformation and suggest that hypermethylation contributes to the early steps of carcinogenesis."

We describe an approach for analyzing spatial regulation of actin polymerization and depolymerization in vivo in which we tracked single molecules of actin fused to the green fluorescent protein. Polymerization and the lifetime of actin filaments in lamellipodia were measured with high spatial precision. Basal polymerization and depolymerization occurred throughout lamellipodia with largely constant kinetics, and polymerization was promoted within one micron of the lamellipodium tip. Most of the actin filaments in the lamellipodium were generated by polymerization away from the tip."

We show that most birds wintering on western Caribbean islands come from the northern portion of the species' North American breeding range, whereas those on more easterly islands are primarily from southern breeding areas. Although segregated by breeding latitude, birds within local wintering areas derive from a wide range of breeding longitudes, indicating considerable population mixing with respect to breeding longitude. These results are useful for assessing the effects of wintering habitat loss on breeding population abundances and for predicting whether the demographic consequences will be concentrated or diffuse."

https://openalex.org/W2006936902,"The human cofactor complexes ARC (activator-recruited cofactor) and CRSP (cofactor required for Sp1 activation) mediate activator-dependent transcription in vitro. Although these complexes share several common subunits, their structural and functional relationships remain unknown. Here, we report that affinity-purified ARC consists of two distinct multisubunit complexes: a larger complex, denoted ARC-L, and a smaller coactivator, CRSP. Reconstituted in vitro transcription with biochemically separated ARC-L and CRSP reveals differential cofactor functions. The ARC-L complex is transcriptionally inactive, whereas the CRSP complex is highly active. Structural determination by electron microscopy (EM) and three-dimensional reconstruction indicate substantial differences in size and shape between ARC-L and CRSP. Moreover, EM analysis of independently derived CRSP complexes reveals distinct conformations induced by different activators. These results suggest that CRSP may potentiate transcription via specific activator-induced conformational changes."

The activated JAK kinases regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins and the formation of different STAT complexes that translocate to the nucleus to initiate gene transcription via binding to distinct elements in the promoters of IFN-activated genes. There is strong evidence that, in addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphorylation on serine is required for the transcriptional properties of Stat1 and Stat3 (reviewed in Ref. 17.Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Stat1 has a phosphorylation site in its C terminus, serine 727, which plays a critical role in the induction of gene transcription. Previous studies have established that phosphorylation of Ser-727 in Stat1 is essential for Type II IFN (IFNγ)-dependent transcriptional activation (18.Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1995; 28: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1742) Google Scholar, 19.Zhu X. wen Z. Xu L.Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2062-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 22.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Similarly, phosphorylation of Stat3 on Ser-727 is required for the full transcriptional activity of this protein without modifying its DNA-binding properties (21.Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2062-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The functional relevance of serine phosphorylation of Stat1 has been demonstrated in studies in which it was shown that complementation of Stat1-deficient cells with a Ser-727 mutant fails to restore induction of the antiproliferative and antiviral properties of IFNγ, whereas re-expression of the wild type protein restores such defects (23.Bromberg J.F.

Virol. 1996; 70: 647-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the studies evaluating the functional relevance of serine phosphorylation of Stat1 have been performed in the Type II IFN-system. However, there is evidence that Stat1 is also phosphorylated on serine during engagement of the Type I IFN (IFNα) receptor (16.Uddin S. Lekmine F. Sharma N. Majchrzak B. Mayer I. Young P.R. Bokoch G.M. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27634-27640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 25.Su L. David M. J. Biol.

The mechanisms regulating Type I IFN-inducible phosphorylation of Stat1 on serine 727 have not been elucidated, and the serine kinase regulating such phosphorylation remains unknown. A good candidate kinase would have been the p38 MAP kinase, as the STAT-serine phosphorylation site is in a conserved motif, which is a potential site for phosphorylation by proline-directed kinases of the MAP kinase family (17.Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Furthermore, previous studies had shown that pharmacological or molecular inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase pathway blocks interferon-dependent gene transcription (14.Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J.

Lekmine F. Sharma N. Majchrzak B. Mayer I. Young P.R. Bokoch G.M. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27634-27640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In the present study we provide evidence that a member of the PKC family of proteins, PKC-δ, is phosphorylated during engagement of the Type I IFN receptor, and its kinase domain is induced. Our data demonstrate that PKC-δ interacts with Stat1 in an IFNα-dependent manner and regulates its phosphorylation on serine 727. In addition, specific pharmacological inhibitors of PKC-δ, or a dominant-negative PKC-δ mutant, inhibit IFNα-dependent gene transcription in luciferase reporter assays. Interestingly, engagement of PKC-δ also appears to be required for downstream activation of the p38 MAP kinase, suggesting the existence of a dual mechanism by which this PKC isoform participates in the regulation of IFN-dependent responses.

Immune complex kinase assays to detect PKC-δ activation were performed as described previously (14.Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J. Arunkumar P. Alsayed Y. Pine R. Young P.R. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C.

Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-PKC-δ antibody, and immunoprecipitates were washed three times with phosphorylation lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg of phosphatidylserine, 20 μm ATP) and were resuspended in 30 ml of kinase buffer containing 5 μg of histone H1 as an exogenous substrate, to which 20–30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was added. The reaction was incubated for 15–30 min at room temperature and was terminated by the addition of SDS-sample buffer. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated form of histone H1 was detected by autoradiography. In some experiments recombinant active PKC-δ kinase (obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) was added directly in the kinase buffer together with Stat1 immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of U-266 cells, and after completion of the in vitro kinase assay reaction, the phosphorylation of Stat1 was detected by SDS-PAGE analysis followed by immunoblotting with an anti-Ser-727 Stat1 antibody. The activation of the p38 kinase in response to IFNα was evaluated by in vitro kinase assays as described previously (14.Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J. Arunkumar P. Alsayed Y. Pine R. Young P.R.

The Stat1 wild type cDNA (provided by Dr. James Darnell, Rockefeller University, New York, NY) was amplified by PCR. The primers that were used were: N terminus, 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGATGTCTCAGTGGTACGAACTTC-3′; C terminus, 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGCTATACTGTGTTCATCATACTGTC-3′. A BamHI restriction site was attached in both sites of the primers. The amplified product was digested with BamHI and cloned inBamHI-digested PGEX 4T1 vector. The orientation of the open reading frame was then determined by restriction digestion analysis. The correct orientation of the open reading frame containing the clone was subsequently selected and used to produce the GST-Stat1 fusion by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction (6.Uddin S.

The GST-Stat1 fusion protein was subsequently used as an exogenous substrate in in vitro kinase assays using anti-PKC-δ immunoprecipitates from lysates of IFNα-treated cells. Cells were transfected with a β-galactosidase expression vector and either an ISRE luciferase construct or a luciferase reporter gene containing eight GAS elements linked to a minimal prolactin promoter (8X-GAS) using the Superfect transfection reagent in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended procedure (Qiagen). The ISRE-luciferase construct (14.Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J. Arunkumar P. Alsayed Y. Pine R. Young P.R. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, triplicate cultures were either left untreated or treated with 5 × 103 units/ml IFNα or IFNβ as indicated. In the experiments in which the effects of overexpression of a kinase-defective PKC-δ mutant were determined, the cells were transfected with a PKC-δ mutant in which arginine 376 was replaced with lysine, therefore lacking a functional catalytic domain (29.Soh J.-W.

Bernard Weinstein, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY). The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and after cell lysis, luciferase activity was measured using the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). The measured luciferase activities were normalized for β-galactosidase activity for each sample. We first determined whether during IFNα treatment of sensitive cells, PKC-δ is phosphorylated/activated. U-266 or Molt-4 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of IFNα, and cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against the phosphorylated form of PKC-δ on threonine 505. As shown in Fig. 1, treatment of cells with IFNα resulted in strong phosphorylation of the protein, whereas there was no change in the amount of protein detected prior to and after IFNα treatment (Fig. 1, A–D). Similarly, treatment of cells with IFNβ also resulted in strong phosphorylation of PKC-δ (Fig. 2), suggesting that this kinase is a common element in the signaling pathways of all different Type I IFNs.Figure 2IFN β-dependent phosphorylation of PKC -δ. A, Molt-4 cells were treated with IFNβ for the indicated times.

Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of IFNα, and after cell lysis and immunoprecipitation with an anti-PKC-δ antibody, in vitro kinase assays were carried out on the immunoprecipitates using histone H1 as an exogenous substrate. IFNα treatment resulted in strong induction of the kinase activity of PKC-δ as evidenced by the phosphorylation of histone H1 (Fig. 3). Such phosphorylation of histone H1 in the kinase assay was blocked by pretreatment of cells with rottlerin, a pharmacological inhibitor that selectively blocks activation of PKC-δ (30.Jain N.

On the other hand, pretreatment of cells with SB203580 (an inhibitor of the p38 MAP kinase) or LY379196 (a selective inhibitor of PKC-β) had no effects on the activation of PKC-δ and phosphorylation of histone H1 in the kinase assays (data not shown), further demonstrating the specificity of the process. Thus, during engagement of the Type I IFN receptor, PKC-δ is phosphorylated and its kinase activity is induced, strongly suggesting that this member of the PKC family of proteins plays a role in the generation of signals by the Type I IFN receptor. It is well known that PKC-δ exhibits serine kinase activity in other systems. Our data that this serine kinase is activated during engagement of the Type I IFN receptor raised the possibility that it may function as a STAT kinase and regulate phosphorylation of Stat1 on serine 727. To investigate such a hypothesis, experiments were performed in which cells were pretreated in the presence or absence of PKC inhibitors, and the IFNα-inducible phosphorylation of Stat1 on serine 727 was examined by immunoblotting with an antibody against the phosphorylated form of Stat1 on serine 727. We first used H7, a pan-PKC pharmacological inhibitor, which in addition to PKC-δ, inhibits activation of the various other PKC isoforms. Molt-4 or U-266 cells were preincubated in the presence or absence of H7, and the IFNα-dependent phosphorylation of Stat1 on Ser727 was examined in the continuous presence or absence of the inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 4, pretreatment of cells with H7 diminished the serine phosphorylation of Stat1, suggesting that PKC activity is required for such an event (Fig. 4). We subsequently performed similar experiments, using the PKC-δ-specific inhibitor rottlerin (27.Rahman A. Anwar K.N. Uddin S. Xu N. Ye R. Platanias L.C. Malik A.B. Mol. Cell.

Pretreatment of cells with rottlerin also blocked the IFNα-induced Stat1 serine phosphorylation (Fig. 5 A, B, D, and E), whereas it had no effects on the IFN-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 on Tyr-701 (Fig. 5, C andF).Figure 5IFN α-dependent phosphorylation of Stat1 on serine 727 is PKC -δ-dependent.

https://openalex.org/W2004054097,"Neurotrophins are essential to the normal development and maintenance of the nervous system. Neurotrophin signaling is mediated by Trk family tyrosine kinases such as TrkA, TrkB and TrkC, as well as by the pan-neurotrophin receptor p75NTR. Here we have deleted the trkB gene in cerebellar precursors by Wnt1-driven Cre--mediated recombination to study the function of the TrkB in the cerebellum. Despite the absence of TrkB, the mature cerebellum of mutant mice appears similar to that of wild type, with all types of cell present in normal numbers and positions. Granule and Purkinje cell dendrites appear normal and the former have typical numbers of excitatory synapses. By contrast, inhibitory interneurons are strongly affected: although present in normal numbers, they express reduced amounts of GABAergic markers and develop reduced numbers of GABAergic boutons and synaptic specializations. Thus, TrkB is essential to the development of GABAergic neurons and regulates synapse formation in addition to its role in the development of axon terminals."
https://openalex.org/W2062453241,"Evolution is based on genetic variability and subsequent phenotypic selection. Mechanisms that modulate the rate of mutation according to environmental cues, and thus control the balance between genetic stability and flexibility, might provide a distinct evolutionary advantage. Stress-induced mutations stimulated by unfavorable environments, and possible mechanisms for their induction, have been described for several organisms, but research in this area has mainly focused on microorganisms. We have analyzed the influence of adverse environmental conditions on the genetic stability of the higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Here we show that a biotic stress factor-attack by the oomycete pathogen Peronospora parasitica-can stimulate somatic recombination in Arabidopsis. The same effect was observed when plant pathogen-defense mechanisms were activated by the chemicals 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid (INA) or benzothiadiazole (BTH), or by a mutation (cim3). Together with previous studies of recombination induced by abiotic factors, these findings suggest that increased somatic recombination is a general stress response in plants. The increased genetic flexibility might facilitate evolutionary adaptation of plant populations to stressful environments."

We assessed the ability of primary baby mouse kidney (BMK) epithelial cells frombax−/−, bak−/−, andbax−/−bak−/− mice to be transformed by E1A alone or in conjunction with dominant-negative p53 (p53DD). Although E1A alone transformed BMK cells from p53-deficient mice, E1A alone did not transform BMK cells frombax−/−, bak−/−, orbax−/−bak−/− mice. Thus, the loss of both Bax and Bak was not sufficient to relieve p53-dependent suppression of transformation in epithelial cells. To test the requirement for Bax and Bak in other death signaling pathways, stable E1A plus p53DD-transformed BMK cell lines were derived from the bax−/−,bak−/−, and bax−/−bak−/− mice and characterized for their response to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-mediated apoptosis. The loss of both Bax and Bak severely impaired TNF-α-mediated apoptosis, but the presence of either Bax or Bak alone was sufficient for cell death. Cytochrome c was released from mitochondria, and caspase-9 was activated in Bax- or Bak-deficient cells in response to TNF-α but not in cells deficient in both.

Mice deficient for both Bax and Bak die perinatally and have multiple developmental defects including webbing between the digits, imperforated vaginal canal, and accumulation of excess cells in the hematopoietic and central nervous systems (29.Lindsten T. Ross A.J. King A. Zong W.-X. Rathmell J.C. Shiels H.A. Ulrich E. Waymire K.G. Mahar P. Frauwirth K. Chen Y. Wei M. Eng V.M. Adelman D.M. Simon M.C. Ma A. Golden J.A. Evan G. Korsmeyer S.J.

Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) from these mice show that Bax and Bak are necessary for apoptosis induced by staurosporin, UV radiation, etoposide, thapsigargin, and tunicamycin in the short term (30.Wei M. Zong W.-X. Cheng E. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A. Roth K. MacGregor G. Thompson C. Korsmeyer S. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3354) Google Scholar). The release of cytochrome c in response to the overexpression of tBid is also inhibited in bax−/−bak−/− cells (30.Wei M. Zong W.-X. Cheng E. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A. Roth K. MacGregor G. Thompson C. Korsmeyer S. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3354) Google Scholar), suggesting that these proteins are essential regulators of apoptotic mitochondrial function in response multiple stimuli. Whether these findings can be extrapolated to other cell types and additional death stimuli was not known. Here we determined that Bax and/or Bak were not essential for p53 to suppress oncogenic transformation which is likely mediated in all or in part by apoptosis. E1A expression in primary kidney epithelial cells induces p53-dependent apoptosis that must be inhibited for transformation to occur (1.Debbas M. White E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 31.Sabbatini P. Lin J. Levine A.J. White E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2184-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 32.Chiou S.-K. Tseng C.C. Rao L. White E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6553-6566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show that E1A alone transformed primary baby mouse kidney epithelial cells (BMK) fromp53−/− mice but not from wild-type,bax−/−, bak−/−, orbax−/−bak−/− mice. However, wild-type, bax−/−,bak−/−, andbax−/−bak−/− BMK cells were efficiently transformed by E1A and dominant-negative p53 (p53DD). Thus, the loss of Bax, Bak, or both did not abrogate the requirement for loss of p53 function during E1A-induced epithelial cell transformation. Stable E1A plus p53DD-transformed BMK cell lines were derived from the foci from bax−/−,bak−/−, and bax−/−bak−/− mice in the BMK cell transformation assay and were characterized for their ability to undergo apoptosis by death receptor signaling pathways. The loss of either Bax or Bak did not abrogate TNF-α-induced apoptosis; however, the loss of both Bax and Bak conferred resistance to apoptosis. The absence of either Bax or Bak did not affect the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol in response to TNF-α; however, the loss of both dramatically prevented the release of cytochrome cand caspase-9 activation. These findings indicate that Bax and Bak function redundantly to release cytochrome c from the mitochondria to implement apoptosis in response to death receptor signaling, but both are dispensable for p53-mediated suppression of oncogenic transformation. Three matings were performed as follows: mice were bred by crossing mice that werebax+/−bak−/− withbax+/−bak−/−;bax+/−bak+/− withbax+/−bak−/−; andbax+/−bak+/+ withbax+/−bak+/+. Newly born litters of pups (less than 48 h) were collected and numbered. Tail snips from each pup were collected and processed for DNA preparation, and PCR genotyping was performed as described for Bak (29.Lindsten T. Ross A.J. King A. Zong W.-X. Rathmell J.C. Shiels H.A.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3112-3119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of BMK cells from primary kidneys from murine pups was based on the BRK preparation protocol (34.Ruley H.E. Nature. 1983; 304: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Kidneys from each pup were removed and processed separately under sterile conditions. Each pair of kidneys was washed with PBS, placed into 10 ml of PBS containing 2.5 mg/ml dispase II (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 2.5 μg/ml collagenase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), mechanically disrupted, and then stirred at 37 °C for 30 min. Following the incubation, 5 ml of DMEM plus 5% FBS was added and mixed by pipetting, and clumps were allowed to settle for 5 min, and the BMK were collected from the supernatant by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min. The BMK cells were resuspended in 550 μl of DMEM plus 5% FBS, divided into two portions of 250 μl each, and electroporated in the presence of 10 μg of linearized pCMVE1A plasmid DNA (35.White E. Cipriani R. Sabbatini P. Denton A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2968-2978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 110 μg of salmon sperm carrier DNA or 10 μg of linearized pCMVE1A plasmid DNA and 10 μg of linearized p53DD plasmid DNA (36.Shaulian E. Zauberman A. Ginsberg D. Oren M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5581-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and 100 μg of salmon sperm carrier DNA. Post-transfection each condition was plated into three 6-cm tissue culture dishes. The culture medium was changed 1–2 times per week for 6 weeks to allow colonies to form. Colonies were ring-cloned from two plates to ensure that clones derived would be independent using standard tissue culture techniques. Giemsa stain (Sigma) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to visualize colonies on culture plates. The following antibodies were used for indirect immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting analysis; the mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against the native and denatured forms of the cytochrome c protein were purchased from PharMingen; the rabbit N-20 polyclonal antibody directed against amino acids 11–30 of human Bax was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); the rabbit polyclonal antibody (NT) against amino acids 1–21 of human Bax, which recognizes a conformation-specific form of Bax, and the rabbit polyclonal antibody (NT) raised against amino acids 23–37 of human Bak were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); the mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against p53 (pAB421), the anti-adenovirus 2 E1A (M73), and actin were purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Boston, MA); the mouse monoclonal antibody directed against caspase-9 was purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada); and the rhodamine-conjugated, goat-anti-mouse antibody was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). BMK cells were prepared for immunoprecipitation as described previously (18.Sundararajan R. Cuconati A. Nelson D. White E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45120-45127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, the immunoprecipitation was carried out in 2% CHAPS lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, and 2% CHAPS). The Sepharose was washed three times in a 0.5% CHAPS wash buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% CHAPS). Cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by Western blotting with the Bax NT antibody. BMK cell lines were untreated, treated with CHX alone (0.05 μg/ml CHX) (Sigma), or treated with both TNF-α (100 units/ml mTNF-α) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and CHX (0.05 μg/ml). After 16 h of treatment cells were harvested by trypsinization, centrifuged, and resuspended in PBS. Cells were diluted 1:100 in 0.25% trypan blue solution (Invitrogen) and counted in a hemocytometer to assess the number of dead blue cells from the total number of cells counted. For fluorescence-activated cytometry BMK cells were treated with TNF/CHX or CHX alone for 16 h. After treatment cells were harvested by trypsinization, centrifuged, and resuspended in PBS. The cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) and RNase A (50 μg/ml) and incubated overnight. The cells were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur system (San Jose, CA). Wild-type and Bax- and Bak-deficient BMK cells were harvested, counted, and plated at specific dilutions, as indicated in the figure. Twenty four hours after plating the cells were treated with or without TNF/CHX for 16 h, as described above. Following treatment with TNF/CHX, the plates were washed once with PBS and normal growth medium (DMEM + 5% FBS) was restored. After 4 days the plates were Giemsa-stained as described above, and colonies of cells were counted. Cell extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and blotted semidry as described previously (13.Perez D. White E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Proteins were detected by antibody as indicated and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's specifications (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were treated with TNF/CHX for 0 and 4 h. Subcellular fractionation was performed as described (37.Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, washed in PBS, and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 42 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A). Cells were incubated in lysis buffer for 20 min on ice. Sucrose (2 m in lysis buffer) was added to adjust to a final concentration of 0.32 m sucrose and passed through a 30-gauge syringed needle 10 times. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to eliminate nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000 × g to remove the mitochondrial pellet and then at 100,000 × g to yield the cytosolic soluble fraction (S-100). The S-100 was subjected to Western blot analysis by probing with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the denatured form of the cytochrome c. Cells were untreated or treated with TNF/CHX for 4 h. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed essentially as described (38.Perez D. White E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1255-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed at room temperature with 4.0% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with ice-cold PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were labeled with the antibodies that recognize native cytochrome c and visualized with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. Digital photography was performed using a Nikon FXA microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics (Nikon Inc., Garden City, NY). The p53 tumor suppressor protein is crucial in preventing E1A-mediated transformation in primary baby rat kidney (BRK) epithelial cells (1.Debbas M. White E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar,2.White E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7836-7846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BRK cells transfected with E1A alone fail to form foci due to the onset of apoptosis. However, BRK cells transfected with E1A and dominant-negative p53 efficiently form transformed foci and have been cloned into stable cell lines (1.Debbas M. White E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 31.Sabbatini P. Lin J. Levine A.J. White E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2184-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 32.Chiou S.-K. Tseng C.C. Rao L. White E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6553-6566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The utility of this strategy was expanded by adapting it to primary mouse cells where many apoptotic and tumor suppressor genes have been targeted for gene disruption. To explore the requirement of Bax and Bak in p53-mediated apoptosis, we transfected primary BMK cells with E1A or E1A plus p53DD and assayed for transformation. Wild-type BMK cells were not transformed by E1A alone (Fig. 1). Transformation by E1A requires inactivation of p53 with a dominant-negative p53 mutant in wild-type cells or the use of BMK cells from p53-deficient mice to abolish p53 function (Fig. 1). Expression of E1A alone does not promote transformation of BMK cells from mice lacking Bax, Bak, or both Bax and Bak, indicating that both Bax and Bak may be dispensable for p53-dependent apoptosis (Fig. 1). No transformants were obtained with E1A alone (Fig. 1), and all E1A plus p53DD-derived cell lines expressed E1A and high levels of the mutant p53 (see below). Interestingly, overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 or the adenovirus Bcl-2 homologue E1B 19K inhibits p53-mediated apoptosis (39.Chiou S.-K. Rao L. White E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2556-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 40.Han J. Sabbatini P. Perez D. Rao L. Modha D. White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 461-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 41.Sabbatini P. Chiou S.-K. Rao L. White E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1060-1070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and enables transformation by E1A (42.Rao L. Debbas M. Sabbatini P. Hockenberry D. Korsmeyer S. White E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7742-7746Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 43.White E. Sabbatini P. Debbas M. Wold W.S.M. Kusher D.I. Gooding L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the loss of Bax and Bak function may not be equivalent to the gain of an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 function. The formation of transformed foci by E1A plus p53DD in the wild-type, Bax, Bak, and Bax/Bak-deficient BMK cells allowed us to establish stable transformed cell lines, with defined deficiency in these apoptotic regulators. Although these cell lines are not suitable for studies on p53-mediated apoptosis due to the constitutive inactivation of endogenous p53, they can be used to define the roles of Bax and Bak in other apoptotic pathways. In order to study molecular events of apoptosis affected by Bax and Bak expression, stable BMK cell lines, transformed with E1A plus p53DD, were derived from the wild-type (W),bax−/− (X), bak−/−(K), and bax−/−bak−/− (D) mice. Individual foci from the transformation assay, as in Fig. 1, were cloned and grown into cell lines. Multiple independently cloned cell lines from each genotype were analyzed (W1–3, X1–3, K1–3, and D1–3), and expression of E1A, p53DD, Bax, and Bak was assessed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2A). The expression of E1A was similar in all of the cell lines tested, as were the levels of p53DD (Fig. 2A). Because all of the cell lines examined expressed both E1A and p53DD, this indicated that expression of both was required for transformation. The immunoblots for Bax and Bak matched genotyping of the parental mouse; however, the wild-type and Bak-deficient cell lines were derived from mice heterozygous for Bax (Bax−/+), and two Bax-deficient cell lines (X2, X3) were derived from mice heterozygous for Bak (Bak−/+) (Fig. 2B). The generation of these cell lines provides a renewable source of BMK epithelial cells with specific gene deficiencies inbax and/or bak. This strategy can be utilized to obtain epithelial cell lines deficient in nearly any gene for which a mouse with a targeted gene disruption has been developed and survives to birth. To test the requirement for Bax and Bak in extrinsic death signaling pathways, the Bax, Bak, and Bax plus Bak-deficient BMK cell lines were characterized for their apoptotic response induced by TNF-α. The BMK cell lines were untreated, treated with cycloheximide alone (CHX), or TNF-α and cycloheximide (TNF/CHX) for 16 h, photographed (Fig. 3A), and analyzed by trypan blue exclusion (Fig. 3B). Cell viability following cycloheximide treatment of all the cell lines was very similar to the untreated control (Fig. 3B). When treated with TNF/CHX the viability of the wild-type, bax−/−, andbak−/− BMK cells dropped dramatically (Fig. 3B), indicating that the presence of either Bax or Bak is sufficient for TNF/CHX to exert its apoptotic effect. In contrast, the absence of both Bax and Bak caused the BMK cells to be resistant to TNF/CHX-mediated killing (Fig. 3B). Viability was also assessed by fluorescence-activated cytometry for DNA content, and these results show the same trends as trypan blue exclusion with the exception that the relative resistance of D2 was slightly greater than D1 (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that the presence of either Bax or Bak is sufficient for TNF/CHX to mediate apoptosis. Because the absence of both Bax and Bak prevents TNF-α-mediated killing, this suggests that Bax and Bak are functionally redundant. To address whether the protection to TNF-α-mediated death signaling conferred by deficiency of both Bax and Bak in short term survival assays was sufficient to produce long term clonogenic survival, wild-type (bax+/−bak+/+; W3) and Bax plus Bak-deficient (bax−/−bak−/−; D3) BMK cell lines were untreated or treated with TNF/CHX for 16 h and assessed for colony formation ability 4–7 days later.

Here, we report on the transfer of the contiguous, nonlinear epitope of ICAM-1, responsible for its association with LFA-1, to a small-molecule framework. These LFA-1 antagonists bound LFA-1, blocked binding of ICAM-1, and inhibited a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) with potency significantly greater than that of cyclosporine A. Furthermore, in comparison to an antibody to LFA-1, they exhibited significant anti-inflammatory effects in vivo.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 525-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 19.Jacobs T. Darji A. Frahm N. Rohde M. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. Weiss S. Mol.

These rafts function as platforms to recruit proteins from distinct classes, such as GPI-anchored proteins and palmitoylated or diacylated transmembrane proteins (21.Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 22.Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8052) Google Scholar, 23.Galbiati F. Razani B. Lisanti M.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 403-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). For example, the pore-forming toxin lysenin binds sphingomyelin in raft membranes (24.Nakai Y. Sakurai Y. Yamaji A. Asou H. Umeda M. Uyemura K. Itoh K. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 62: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), whereas cholera toxin requires both cholesterols and sphingolipids in rafts for its action (25.Orlandi P.A. Fishman P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Binding to cholesterol by listerolysin O, another pore-forming toxin, is important in triggering a conformational change required for toxin oligomerization and channel formation (19.Jacobs T. Darji A. Frahm N. Rohde M. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. Weiss S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Moreover, aerolysin ofAeromonas hydrophila, one of the more widely studied pore-forming toxins, functions via a GPI-anchored protein present in lipid rafts (18.Abrami L. Fivaz M. Glauser P.E. Parton R.G. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 525-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In regard to Cry toxins, phospholipase C treatment ofTrichoplusia ni brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) cleaved GPI-anchored membrane proteins and reduced pore formation by Cry1Ac toxin (26.Lorence A. Darszon A. Bravo A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Binding of these toxins to their respective membrane receptors, which are preferentially associated with lipid rafts, promotes an increase in local toxin concentration within the cell membrane favoring toxin oligomerization required for pore formation, a key step in toxin action. Lipid rafts are detergent-insoluble microdomains enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids, and GPI-anchored proteins (22.Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8052) Google Scholar, 27.Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Nature. 1998; 394: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 31.Jacobson K. Dietrich C.

In fact, the formation of the liquid ordered phase results in membrane insolubility in the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 (22.Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8052) Google Scholar, 27.Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2546) Google Scholar). Hence, insolubility in Triton X-100 has been widely used as a criterion for isolation of rafts from cellular membranes (28.Hooper N.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 35.London E. Brown D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Although lipid rafts have been widely studied in mammalian cells (27.Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2546) Google Scholar,29.Brown D.A.

J. 1997; 323: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), andDrosophila melanogaster (39.Rietveld A. Neutz S. Simons K. Eaton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12049-12054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), their constituents differ widely between species. Currently there are no data on the nature of lipid rafts from any other insect species, including lepidopterans. In this study, we isolated and characterized lipid rafts from the midgut epithelium of two lepidopteran insects, H. virescens andM. sexta. Additionally, we investigated the role of lipid rafts in the toxicity of Cry toxins to H. virescens andM. sexta. We demonstrated that Cry1A toxin-binding molecules, including aminopeptidases and some higher molecular weight bands, and the toxin molecules themselves show differential localization in lipid rafts isolated from these insects. We also showed lipid rafts play an important role in pore formation. This is the first study that suggests a role for lipid rafts in the mechanism of action of Cry toxins. Cry1Ac was produced from wild-type B. thuringiensis strain HD73 grown in nutrient broth sporulation medium for 72 h at 30 °C. Cry1Ab was produced from the acrystalliferous strain 4Q7cry transformed with pHT315-cry1Ab and grown in HCO medium (40.Lecadet M.M. Blondel M.O. Ribier J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1980; 121: 203-212PubMed Google Scholar) for 96 h at 30 °C. Both H. virescens and M. sexta were reared on artificial diet (Southland Bioproducts and Ref. 41.Bell R.A. Joachim F.G. Ann. Entomol. Soc. Am. 1976; 69: 365-373Crossref Google Scholar, respectively). Spores and crystals were harvested and washed with buffer containing 0.01% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Crystals were isolated by NaBr gradients as previously described (42.Cowles E.A. Yunovitz H. Charles J.F. Gill S.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 2738-2744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), solubilized in 10 mm Na2CO3, pH 10, at 37 °C for 1 h, and then activated with trypsin (1:5 w/w) at 18 °C for 6 h. The proteins were further purified by anion exchange chromatography (SMART, Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (8.Oltean D.I. Pullikuth A.K. Lee H.K. Gill S.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 4760-4766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the purified toxins were dialyzed against appropriate buffers. Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac toxins, 100 μg, were biotinylated using the protein biotinylation module kit (Amersham Biosciences) and then purified with Sephadex G25 columns. Protein concentration in the collected fractions was determined by BCA (Pierce). The biotinylated toxins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin and ECL™ (Amersham Bioscience). BBMV were prepared from early (day 1–2) 5th instar H. virescens andM. sexta midguts as described (43.Wolfersberger M. Luethy P. Maurer A. Parenti P. Sacchi F.V. Giordana B. Hanozet G.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 86A: 301-308Crossref Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Purified BBMV were suspended in TNE buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2 mm EGTA). An equal volume of BBMV (100 μg) and pre-chilled 2% Triton X-100 were aliquoted into a SW41 tube and mixed. After solubilization for 30 min on ice, the mixture was brought to a final concentration of 60% sucrose and then overlaid with 2 ml each of 50, 40, 30, and 15% sucrose in TNE buffer. The samples were then centrifuged at 2 °C for 18 h at 80,000 × g. Insoluble lipid rafts, present in the middle of the sucrose gradients, were collected from the top of the tube, washed twice with TNE buffer, and centrifuged at 2 °C for 30 min at 150,000 × g. Soluble fractions were collected from the bottom of the tubes. BBMV pretreatments with detergents were performed with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min or with 0.2% saponin (Sigma) on ice for 30 min, with subsequent addition of an equal volume of 2% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Direct treatment of isolated lipid rafts was done using the same conditions. Isolated lipid rafts were treated with MβCD or saponin and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants and pellets were collected respectively, without subsequent Triton X-100 addition. Toxin association experiments were performed using different concentrations of biotinylated toxins, which were pre-incubated with BBMV at 4 °C for 1 h with subsequent isolation of lipid rafts by Triton X-100 treatment and separated by the sucrose gradient mentioned above. Proteins were electrotransferred to Immobilon membranes (Amersham Biosciences), which were then blocked with 5% powdered milk in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma) for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibody diluted in 3% milk, phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.05% Tween 20. Dilutions of antibodies used were: anti-M. sexta fasciclin II, 1:2000 (44.Wright J.W. Copenhaver P.F. Dev. Biol. 2000; 225: 59-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); anti-H. virescens-APN120 (6.Gill S.S. Cowles E.A. Francis V. J. Biol.

Blots were subsequently incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences) or goat anti-guinea pig (Jackson)), and the signal was detected by ECL™ (Amersham Biosciences). Toxin overlay assays (TOAs) for Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac were performed as described (8.Oltean D.I. Pullikuth A.K. Lee H.K. Gill S.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 4760-4766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 1:3,000 diluted Cry1A antibodies (47.de Maagd R.A. Kwa M.S. van der Klei H. Yamamoto T. Schipper B. Vlak J.M. Stiekema W.J. Bosch D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 1537-1543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins prepared as above were transferred to Immobilon membranes, which were then digested with phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (Glyko, 1.5 units/10 ml) according to Guther et al. (48.Guther M.L. de Almeida M.L. Rosenberry T.L. Ferguson M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The presence of a cleaved GPI anchor was detected with anti-CRD antibody (Glyko). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA. Leucine aminopeptidase activities were assayed as previously described (43.Wolfersberger M. Luethy P. Maurer A. Parenti P. Sacchi F.V. Giordana B. Hanozet G.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 86A: 301-308Crossref Scopus (544) Google Scholar) using leucine-p-nitroanilide as substrate (Sigma). BBMV samples were treated with 10 mm MβCD at 37 °C for 30 min, with 0.2% saponin on ice for 30 min, or with 1% Triton X-100 on ice for 30 min. These detergent-treated samples were then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min, the supernatants (S) and pellets (P) were collected, and both fractions were used for quantification of total cholesterols and phospholipids. Cholesterol quantification was performed with the Infinity cholesterol reagent from Sigma using the manufacturer's protocol. Cholesterol standards were purchased from Sigma. Total phospholipid quantification was performed using Barlett's method (49.Barlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, samples and standards were hydrolyzed in 0.2 ml of perchloric acid for 2 h at 180 °C, cooled to room temperature, and subsequently mixed with 1.25 ml of reducing reagent (1% sodium bisulfite, 0.2% sodium sulfite, and 0.017% 1-amino-2-naphthol-4-sulfonic acid) and 1.25 ml of molybdate reagent (0.44% ammonium molybdate, 1.4% sulfide acid). The mixtures were then treated in boiling water bath for 10 min. The absorbance determined at 820 nm represents the amount of phospho groups, which indicates the amount of phospholipids present in the sample. Lipid extractions were performed as described (50.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 194: 497-508Google Scholar). Briefly, total lipids were extracted from the isolated lipid rafts with chloroform:methanol (2:1), purified with chloroform:methanol:H2O (3:48:47), and subsequently dried. Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry was performed as described (51.Kerwin J.L. Tuininga A.R. Ericsson L.H. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1102-1114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid samples were infused into the source via a 50-μm fused silica transfer line at 3 μl/min. Spectra from samples containing 5 ng/μl lipid or more were acquired in less than 10 s of total acquisition time. Negative ion ms/ms was run with an orifice voltage from −60 to −80 V. Samples were scanned between 500 and 900 atomic mass units in the negative ionization mode. Spectra were subsequently collected and analyzed using proprietary software from Sciex Corp. Because the total area of the spectra (St) represents the total amount of lipids, the area of an individual peak (Si) represents the relative amount of a specific lipid; the relative ratio of a specific lipid was thus determined asSi/St, and the data obtained are given in Fig. 3. Membrane potentials were monitored with the fluorescent positively charged dye, 3,3′-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine (Molecular Probes; 1.5 μm final, 1 mm stock in Me2SO). Lipid raft vesicles were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, suspended in 150 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, buffer, and sonicated with six pulses of 30 s each at 25 °C (Branson 1200 sonic bath) in the same solution. Fluorescence was recorded at the 620/670 nm excitation/emission wavelength pair using an Aminco SLM spectrofluorometer (26.Lorence A. Darszon A. Bravo A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Hyperpolarization causes dye internalization into the membrane vesicles and a fluorescence decrease, whereas depolarization has the opposite effect. Dye calibration and determinations of the resting membrane potentials were performed in the presence of valinomycin (2 μm) by successive additions of KCl to raft vesicles (10 μg) suspended in 150 mmN-methyl-d-glucamine chloride (MeGluCl), 10 mm HEPES-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer (1.8 ml). All measurements were made at 25 °C with constant stirring. Time 0 (t) was when raft vesicles were added, and subsequently toxin (50 nm) was added after 2 min. After the first hyperpolarization produced, successive additions of KCl (4, 8, 12, 16, 32, and 64 mm, final concentration) to the raft vesicles were performed. The slope (m) of the curves ΔF(%) versus K+ equilibrium potential ( EK+) (mV) orversus external K+ concentration was determined. EK+ was calculated using the Nernst equation. Changes in fluorescence determinations were repeated three times. Pore formation activity was also analyzed in raft vesicles that were treated with 10 mm MβCD (for H. virescens) or 20 mm MβCD (for M. sexta) at 37 °C for 30 min. Excess MβCD was removed from the membranes by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and raft vesicles were resuspended in 150 mm KCl, 10 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, buffer. Plasma membranes of numerous cell types contain microdomains commonly referred to as lipid rafts, which are biochemically distinct from the bulk plasma membranes (22.Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8052) Google Scholar, 27.Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2546) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are resistant to solubilization at low temperature by nonionic detergents, such as Triton X-100 and, because of their low buoyant density, can be isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation (22.Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8052) Google Scholar,27.Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2546) Google Scholar, 28.Hooper N.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In this study, we isolated Triton X-100-insoluble lipid rafts from H. virescens and M. sexta BBMV. After Triton X-100 treatment and overnight centrifugation, the H. virescens insoluble band (I) was collected from the interface of 50 and 40% sucrose layers, whereas the soluble fraction (S) was collected from the bottom sucrose layer. The M. sextainsoluble band was collected from the interface of 40 and 30% sucrose layers. H. virescens and M. sexta Triton X-100-insoluble lipid rafts migrated to different positions in the sucrose gradient suggesting the lipid components or lipid-protein ratios of these rafts were different. Subsequent lipid analysis supported these observations (see below, and Fig. 3). BBMV subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation alone were apparently unchanged and consistently isolated in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 1, panels A and B,lanes 2–4). However, addition of Triton X-100 solubilized some proteins, whereas others remained in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 1, panels A and B, lanes 5and 6). The protein profiles of BBMV from H. virescens (HB) and M. sexta (MB), soluble fractions (S), and insoluble fractions (I) obtained upon Triton X-100 treatment were significantly different. Two isotypes of M. sexta fasciclin, a lipid raft-marker protein (39.Rietveld A. Neutz S. Simons K. Eaton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12049-12054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), were recognized by the M. sextaanti-fasciclin antibody and were present exclusively in the insoluble fractions (Fig. 1, panel C, d). Similar results were obtained with H. virescens (Fig. 1,panel C, a). These data confirmed that the Triton X-100-insoluble fractions isolated from sucrose gradients were lipid rafts. In contrast, the 57-kDa V-ATPase B subunit and the 84-kDa NSF homolog were exclusively partitioned into the soluble fraction (Fig. 1, panel C, b–f). InM. sexta, another 97-kDa protein, which is likely the p97/CDC48 homolog (53.Latterich M. Frohlich K.U. Schekman R. Cell. 1995; 82: 885-893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), was detected exclusively in lipid rafts (Fig. 1, panel C, f). Collectively, these data show that proteins are not uniformly distributed within the plasma membrane, but some are selectively localized into lipid raft microdomains. Both MβCD and saponin are cholesterol-depleting reagents. MβCD is an effective extracellular cholesterol acceptor that extracts cholesterol from membranes (54.Kilsdonk E.P. Yancey P.G. Stoudt G.W. Bangerter F.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17250-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), whereas saponin binds cholesterol and sequesters it from other interactions, but does not extract it from the membrane (55.Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In our study, pretreatment of the BBMV sample with MβCD and saponin before lipid rafts isolation differentially affected the resultant lipid rafts (Fig. 2,panels A and B). Addition of MβCD resulted in BBMV becoming resistant to detergent solubilization. In addition, the protein profile of the isolated Triton X-100-insoluble fraction from MβCD-treated BBMV was similar to that of the control BBMV (without Triton X-100 treatment), but not to the profile of typical lipid rafts (Fig. 2, panels A and B, lanes 8 and2, and lane 4). However, pretreatment of membranes with saponin disrupted lipid rafts. Most raft-associated proteins became Triton X-100-soluble upon saponin p"
https://openalex.org/W2013402314,"Although motions at the surface of tectonic plates are well determined, the accompanying horizontal mantle flow is not. We have combined observations of surface deformation and upper mantle seismic anisotropy to estimate this flow field for western North America. We find that the mantle velocity is 5.5 +/- 1.5 centimeters per year due east in a hot spot reference frame, nearly opposite to the direction of North American plate motion (west-southwest). The flow is only weakly coupled to the motion of the surface plate, producing a small drag force. This flow field is probably due to heterogeneity in mantle density associated with the former Farallon oceanic plate beneath North America."
https://openalex.org/W2081211846,"The localizations of three members of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) family were studied in HeLa cells. Using hippocalcin-EYFP and NCS-1-ECFP, it was found that their localization differed dramatically in resting cells. NCS-1 had a distinct predominantly perinuclear localization (similar to trans-Golgi markers), whereas hippocalcin was present diffusely throughout the cell. Upon the elevation of intracellular Ca2+, hippocalcin rapidly translocated to the same perinuclear compartment as NCS-1. Another member of the family, neurocalcin δ, also translocated to this region after a rise in Ca2+ concentration. Permeabilization of transfected cells using digitonin caused loss of hippocalcin and neurocalcin δ in the absence of calcium, but in the presence of 10 μm Ca2+, both proteins translocated to and were retained in the perinuclear region. NCS-1 localization was unchanged in permeabilized cells regardless of calcium concentration. The localization of NCS-1 was unaffected by mutations in all functional EF hands, indicating that its localization was independent of Ca2+. A minimal myristoylation motif (hippocalcin-(1–14)) fused to EGFP resulted in similar perinuclear targeting, showing that localization of these proteins is because of the exposure of the myristoyl group. This was confirmed by mutation of the myristoyl motif of NCS-1 and hippocalcin that resulted in both proteins remaining cytosolic, even at elevated Ca2+concentration. Dual imaging of hippocalcin-EYFP and cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in Fura Red-loaded cells demonstrated the kinetics of the Ca2+/myristoyl switch in living cells and showed that hippocalcin rapidly translocated with a half-time of ∼12 s after a short lag period when Ca2+ was elevated. These results demonstrate that closely related Ca2+sensor proteins use their myristoyl groups in distinct ways in vivo in a manner that will determine the time course of Ca2+ signal transduction.

Calcium is a widely used intracellular signal that regulates many different cellular processes in a very specific manner.

Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4395) Google Scholar). The existence of highly localized changes in Ca2+ concentration in addition to global Ca2+ changes has been increasingly highlighted, and these local Ca2+ signals are likely to contribute to the specificity of Ca2+ actions (2.Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Berridge M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2213-2222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of Ca2+ signaling is also the result, in part, of the existence of many different Ca2+-binding proteins, which act as Ca2+ sensors in the transduction of Ca2+ signals. Localization of Ca2+ sensors could be a significant factor, and the effect of localization of Ca2+ sensors on signal transduction has been examined for two such proteins. Calmodulin responds to global Ca2+changes by binding Ca2+ and then subsequently to target proteins; it can also translocate into the nucleus (3.Teruel M.N. Chen W. Persechini A. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 86-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 4.Craske H. Takeo T. Gerasimenko O. Vaillant C. Torok K. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Protein kinase C isoforms also show specific patterns of translocation to the plasma membrane (6.Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Analysis of the factors that determine the localization of other Ca2+ sensors is likely to be crucial for further understanding of Ca2+ signal transduction, but has so far been little studied. The neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) 1The abbreviations used are: NCSneuronal calcium sensorGCAPguanylyl cyclase-activating proteinVILIPvisinin-like proteinPIphosphatidylinositolGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidPBSphosphate-buffered saline1The abbreviations used are: NCSneuronal calcium sensorGCAPguanylyl cyclase-activating proteinVILIPvisinin-like proteinPIphosphatidylinositolGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidPBSphosphate-buffered salineproteins are a family of high affinity Ca2+-binding proteins that can sense Ca2+ elevations above resting Ca2+concentration in the range of 0.1–1.0 μm (7.Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The NCS family includes proteins expressed only in retinal photoreceptors (recoverin (Ref. 8.Ray S. Zozulya S. Niemi G.A. Flaherty K.M. Brolley D. Dizhoor A.M. Mckay D.B. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Takamatsu K. Saitoh S. Miura M. Noguchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), neurocalcins/VILIPs (Ref. 11.Okazaki K. Watanabe M. Ando Y. Hagiwara M. Terasawa M. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)) or with more widespread expression (NCS-1/frequenin (Refs. 12.Pongs O. Lindemeier J. Zhu X.R. Theil T. Endelkamp D. Krah-Jentgens I. Lambrecht H.-G. Koch K.W. Schwemer J. Rivosecchi R. Mallart A. Galceran J. Canal I. Barbas J.A. Ferrus A.

Receptor Signal Trans. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)). All the NCS family members share four characteristic EF hands and a myristoylated N terminus. In the NCS proteins, three (or only two in some family members) of the four EF hands are capable of binding calcium and the EF hand nearest the N terminus (EF1) is altered so that it cannot bind Ca2+ (7.Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The myristoyl tail is a fatty acid post-translationally added to the NCS protein. Its function has been extensively studied in recoverin (14.Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In recoverin, the myristoyl group is buried in a nonpolar pocket formed by EF1 and the surrounding region in the Ca2+-free state (15.Tanaka T. Ames J.B. Harvey T.S. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1995; 376: 444-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). When recoverin binds calcium, there is a large conformational change that ejects the myristoyl group from its pocket (16.Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). This exposed hydrophobic tail is then free to interact with the nonpolar cell membranes or hydrophobic protein domains. This exposure of the myristoyl tail on calcium binding is referred to as a “calcium/myristoyl switch” and considered to be primarily a mechanism by which the protein can translocate from the cytosol to intracellular membranes (14.Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 16.Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The structural features required for the Ca2+/myristoyl switch are apparently conserved in all NCS proteins. The presence of this Ca2+-mediated membrane-association process was, therefore, suggested for the other members of the neuronal calcium sensor protein family (16.Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). There are biochemical data from disrupted cells for some of the family members in support of this mechanism (17.Kobayashi M. Takamatsu K. Saitoh S. Noguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18898-18904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3179-3185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A clear understanding of the localization and translocation of these proteins in response to calcium will allow the generation of models of how these proteins modulate and integrate calcium signals. There has, however, been little in vivo work to demonstrate the Ca2+/myristoyl switch during elevation of Ca2+ concentration within live cells, and so kinetic aspects of the proposed membrane translocation are unknown. neuronal calcium sensor guanylyl cyclase-activating protein visinin-like protein phosphatidylinositol green fluorescent protein 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid phosphate-buffered saline neuronal calcium sensor guanylyl cyclase-activating protein visinin-like protein phosphatidylinositol green fluorescent protein 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid phosphate-buffered saline In this study we have examined the potential Ca2+-myristoyl switch in three NCS proteins. Hippocalcin is expressed most highly in hippocampal neurons (19.Saitoh S. Takamatsu K. Kobayashi M. Noguchi T. Dev. Brain Res. 1994; 80: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and the closely related neurocalcin δ (VILIP-3) in cerebellar Purkinje cells (20.Spilker C. Richter K. Smalla K.H.

Neuroscience. 2000; 99: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies with these proteins suggest Ca2+-dependent membrane interactions (17.Kobayashi M. Takamatsu K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3179-3185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this has not been examined within intact cells. The functions of these two proteins are unknown. In contrast, NCS-1 has been shown to play crucial roles in learning and memory in Caenorhabditis elegans (22.Gomez M. De Castro E. Guarin E. Sasakura H. Kuhara A. Mori I. Bartfai T. Bargmann C.I. Nef P. Neuron. 2001; 30: 241-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), in the release of neurotransmitters (12.Pongs O. Lindemeier J. Zhu X.R. Theil T. Endelkamp D.

In addition, the yeast orthologue of NCS-1 is essential for survival as a regulator of the PI 4-kinase, Pik1 (27.Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Unlike the other NCS proteins, NCS-1 is found outside of the nervous system (23.McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J.

Varnai P. Tuymetovna G. Balla A. Toth Z.E. Oker-Blom C. Roder J. Jeromin A. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40183-40189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Biochemical data suggest that, in contrast to other NCS proteins, NCS-1 can bind to isolated membranes in the absence of Ca2+ (24.McFerran B.W. Weiss J.L. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30258-30265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We have prepared enhanced GFP-variant constructs of these proteins to compare their Ca2+/myristoyl switch mechanisms. We demonstrate different uses of N-terminal myristoylation, which would generate distinct spatio-temporal Ca2+ sensing by members of the NCS family and have assessed the kinetics of the Ca2+/myristoyl switch-dependent membrane translocation in living cells. The EYFP-tagged hippocalcin fusion construct (pHippo-EYFP) was made by the in-frame insertion of a hippocalcin sequence, amplified from rat brain cDNA, into the pEYFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH). The primers contained endonuclease sites (underlined) to facilitate this cloning. The primers were based on the rat nucleotide sequence (GenBank™ accession no. NM017122). The sense primer was designed to the 5′-untranslated region from −165 to −135 (5′-GGCCGGCTAGCTCTTTTTGGGTCAAATGAG-3′;NheI) and the antisense primer with a mutated stop codon to the region +735 to +765 (5′-CCTCTCACTCGAGAACTGGGAAGCGCTGCT-3′; XhoI). The amplified sequence digested with the endonucleasesNheI/XhoI was cloned into the vector pEYFP-N1 digested with the endonucleases NheI/SalI using standard methods. The ECFP-tagged NCS-1 fusion construct (pNCS-1-ECFP) was made by the in-frame insertion of a NCS-1 sequence, amplified from the pNCS-1 plasmid (23.McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), into the pECFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH). The primers contained endonuclease sites (underlined). The sense primer was designed to the region from 0 to +30 (5′-ATACGGTACCATGGGGAAATCCAACAGCAAG-3′;KpnI) and the antisense primer to the region from +492 to +522 (5′-ATGCGGTACCAATACCAGCCCGTCGTAGAGGG-3′;KpnI). The amplified sequence digested with KpnI was inserted into the vector pEYFP-N1 digested with KpnI using standard methods. The pHippo-(1–14)-EGFP construct was made by the endonuclease digestion of pHippo-EYFP using PstI/NotI. This removed all the hippocalcin and EYFP sequences except for the first 14 codons of the hippocalcin sequence, including the 10 codons required for myristoylation. Into this construct was ligated the coding sequence for EGFP. The nonmyristoylatable hippocalcin and NCS-1 fusion constructs (pHippo(G2A)-EYFP and pNCS-(1(G2A)-ECFP) were both made using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Europe, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The primers used for hippocalcin were 5′-TTGGCTCTTCTGCCATGGCCAAGCAGAATAGCAAGCTGCG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGCAGCTTGTATTCTGCTTGGCCATGGCAGAAGAGCCAA-3′ (antisense). The primers used for pNCS were 5′-CTGCAGTCGACGGTACCATGGCGAAATCCAACAGCAAGTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AACTTGCTGTTGGATTTCGCCATGGTACCGTCGACTGCAG-3′ (antisense). The neurocalcin δ plasmid (pNeurocalcin δ) was made by the insertion of the bovine neurocalcin δ sequence, amplified from the pDL1312 vector (18.Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3179-3185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Daniel Ladant, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France), into the pcDNA 3.1(−) vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). The primers contained endonuclease sites (underlined) to facilitate this cloning. The sense primer used was 5′-CCAGGATCCATGGGCAAGCAGAACAGCAA-3′ (BamHI), and the antisense primer was 5′-CCGAAGCTTTCAGAACTGGCTAGCACT-3′ (HindIII). The NCS-1 EF hand mutant construct, pNCS-1EF2–4, was made using pNCS-1 as a template and the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Europe). Three pairs of primers were used sequentially, one pair for each EF hand. The primers used for EF2 were 5′-GCAGGATCGAGTTCTCCCAATTCATCCAGGCTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAGCCTGGATGAATTGGGAGAACTCGATCCTGC-3′ (antisense). The primer pair used for EF3 were 5′-CACCAGAAACCAGATGCTGGACATAGTCGACGCCATTTACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGTAAATGGCGTCGACTATGTCCAGCATCTGGTTTCTGGTG-3′ (antisense). The primer pair used for EF4 were 5′-AACTCTTCAGCAGTTCCAGGAAGGATCCAAGGCCG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGGCCTTGGATCCTTCCTGGAACTGCTGAAGAGTAG-3′ (antisense). The sequence of all these constructs were confirmed by automated sequencing by Oswel (Southampton, United Kingdom (UK)). HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) containing 5% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and plated onto glass coverslips in a 24-well plate at 40,000 cells/well. The cells were allowed 4–24 h to adhere before they were transfected. The transfection reaction mixture contained 93 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), 3 μl of FuGENE™ (Roche), and 4 μl of plasmid DNA (250 μg/μl). This was incubated at room temperature for 30 min before being added dropwise to HeLa cells in a 24-well plate. The cells were maintained for 8–96 h before being used in experiments. Anti-NCS-1 was prepared in rabbits as described previously (23.McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Anti-neurocalcin δ was prepared as a rabbit antiserum using a similar protocol in which rabbits were immunized with purified recombinant neurocalcin δ expressed inEscherichia coli and affinity-purified on immobilized recombinant neurocalcin δ. Anti-γ-adaptin was from Sigma (Poole, UK), anti-GFP from CLONTECH (Basingstoke, UK), and anti-transferrin receptor from Roche (East Sussex, UK). Cells attached to coverslips were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mmNaH2PO4), and fixed in PBS containing 4% formaldehyde for 30 min. The cells were washed twice in PBS and incubated in blocking buffer (0.3% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 h. The blocking buffer was removed and the primary antibody added at the appropriate dilution (anti-γ-adaptin 1 in 100, anti-GFP 1 in 400, anti-transferrin receptor 1 in 400, anti NCS-1 1 in 1,000, and anti neurocalcin δ 1 in 100). The primary antibody was incubated for 1–2 h and removed, and the cells were washed three times in blocking buffer. The cells were then incubated for an additional 1 h with the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody diluted to 1 in 100, (anti-rabbit for anti-NCS-1 and anti-neurocalcin δ primary antibodies and anti-mouse for the other primary antibodies; Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). The cells were washed three times and then incubated in streptavidin-Texas Red (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1 in 50 for 30 min. The cells were washed three times, and the coverslips were dried and mounted on antifade glycerol (glycerol/PBS 9:1, 0.25% diazabicyclo(2-2-2)octane, 0.002% p-phenyldiamine). The cells were examined on a Zeiss Universal microscope and fluorescence imaged using the following standard Zeiss filter sets: ECFP BG3+LP400, FT460, LP495; EYFP, BP450–490, FT510, BP515–565; Texas Red, BP546/12, FT850, LP590. The cells of each well in a 24-well plate were lysed using 100 μl of Laemmli buffer (Sigma, Dorset, UK)/well and boiled for 10 min. The samples were loaded onto and separated using a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then blotted onto nitrocellulose by transverse electrophoresis. The nitrocellulose membranes were washed twice in PBS and placed in blocking buffer (PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin, 5% fetal calf serum, 5% Marvel™ milk powder, 0.5% Tween 20™) for 1 h. The PBT was removed and the primary antibody added at the appropriate dilution in PBS, 3% Marvel™ milk powder (anti-NCS-1 at 1in 1000, affinity-purified anti-neurocalcin δ at 1 in 400, and anti-GFP at 1 in 400 from CLONTECH, Basingstoke, UK). The primary antibody was incubated for 1–2 h and removed, and the membranes were washed three times. The membranes were then incubated for an additional 1 h with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted to 1 in 400 with PBT, (anti-rabbit for anti-NCS-1 and anti-neurocalcin δ primary antibodies and anti-mouse for anti-GFP primary antibodies; Sigma). The membranes were washed once in PBT, three times in PBS, and once with distilled water. The signal was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Transfected HeLa cells were washed three times in Krebs-Ringer buffer (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). The cells were then incubated for 10 min in 1 μm ionomycin in Krebs-Ringer buffer in the presence or absence of 3 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C. The Krebs-Ringer buffer was removed, and the cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for immunofluorescence staining and imaged using a Zeiss Universal microscope fitted with a Nikon Coolpix 995 digital camera. For confocal laser scanning microscopy, live transfected HeLa cells were examined with a Leica TCS-SP-MP microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) using a 166.27-μm pin-hole and a 63× water immersion objective with a 1.2 numerical aperture. For optimal imaging of the spatial distribution of hippocalcin-EYFP, the cells were excited at 514 nm and light collected at 545–625 nm and fluorescence images were collected every 1.86 s with alternate phase-contrast images to check for changes in cell morphology. For dual imaging of hippocalcin-EYFP and NCS-1-ECFP, the cells were excited at 514 nm with light collected at 560–600 nm for EYFP or excited at 458 nm for and light collected at 465–500 nm for ECFP detection. In experiments on the kinetics of Ca2+-dependent translocation, cells were loaded with Fura Red (Molecular Probes) by incubation in 5 μm Fura Red in growth medium for 30 min. The cells were then excited at 488 nm and light collected at 625–725 nm for Fura Red emission and at 525–590 for hippocalcin-EYFP emission and images collected every 137 ms. Ionomycin was added to the bath solution a final concentration of 3 μm. Transfected HeLa cells were washed three times in Krebs-Ringer buffer and incubated for 15 min in 10 μm digitonin in 300 μl of permeabilization buffer (139 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm PIPES, 5 mm EGTA, pH 6.5) in the presence or absence of 10 μm free calcium at 37 °C. If the cells were to be fixed, the buffer was removed and 500 μl of 4% formaldehyde was added per well. For the leakage experiments, the permeabilization buffer was removed and centrifuged briefly at 12,000 rpm to sediment any detached cells. The proteins were concentrated by precipitation with cold methanol (30.Chamberlain L.H. Roth D. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1063-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 100 μl of Laemmli buffer (Sigma). The cells remaining in the wells were solubilized in Laemmli buffer. All samples were boiled for 10 min and then used for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. To determine the localization of the neuronal calcium sensing proteins NCS-1 and hippocalcin in living cells, constructs were made that fused the C terminus of these proteins to the fluorescent proteins ECFP and EYFP to produce the plasmids pNCS-1-ECFP and pHippo-EYFP, respectively. Vector-derived sequence produced a 10- or 13-amino acid linker between the NCS-1 protein and hippocalcin, respectively, and the fluorescent protein. These constructs were transfected into HeLa cells, which do not express detectable levels of the proteins endogenously, and the expressed proteins observed in living and fixed cells. HeLa cells were chosen as a convenient cell type to allow examination of the basic localization and translocation mechanism of these proteins within a cellular environment. To demonstrate their correct expression, Western blots were carried out on samples from transfected cells. Fig. 1 shows that the expressed fusion proteins were of the expected size (∼60 kDa) and recognized by both anti-GFP and specific antibodies. Anti-NCS-1 was used for cells transfected with pNCS-1-ECFP. Expression of Hippo-EYFP could be demonstrated using an antiserum prepared against the closely related protein neurocalcin δ (96% identical (Ref. 7.Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar)). The 60-kDa band representing the fusion proteins was not seen in samples from cells transfected with the control vectors pEYFP-N1 and pECFP-N1 but instead a polypeptide band corresponding to the free fluorescent proteins. Fig. 2 shows the localization of proteins encoded by pNCS-1-ECFP, pHippo-EYFP, and constructs expressing the free fluorescent proteins ECFP and EYFP. The location patterns were not dependent upon expression levels of the proteins and were indistinguishable in cells transfected for between 8 and 96 h and with varying levels of fluorescence intensity at each time point. The free fluorescent proteins were found in the cytoplasm but were particularly concentrated in the nucleus (Fig. 2, A andB). The hippocalcin-EYFP fusion protein was present in the cytoplasm and also in the nucleus but to a lesser extent than ECFP or EYFP (Fig. 2C). The NCS-1 fusion protein, in contrast, had a radically different distribution. The fluorescence of NCS-1-ECFP was at its most intense in a perinuclear region to one side of the nucleus, whereas the nucleus was devoid of fluorescence (Fig. 2D). Additionally, NCS-1 ECFP was also associated with plasma membrane, usually in a patchy distribution. The presence of the ECFP and EYFP tags did not influence the localization of the NCS proteins, as similar localization patterns were seen with wild-type protein detected by immunofluorescence (shown below). In addition, similar localization patterns were seen in living and fixed cells. Previous work has shown that endogenous NCS-1 in COS cells is also localized to a perinuclear compartment that overlaps partially with the trans-Golgi network marker γ-adaptin (28.Bourne Y. Dannenberg J. Pollmann V. Marchot P. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11949-11955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Fig. 3(A–C) shows that ECFP-NCS-1 also partially co-localizes with γ-adaptin. In contrast, ECFP-NCS-1 did not significantly co-localize with the transferrin receptor used as a marker of endosomal compartments (Fig. 3, D–F).Figure 3Comparison of the intracellular localization of NCS-1-ECFP (B and E) with the trans-Golgi marker γ-adaptin (A) and the endosomal marker transferrin receptor (D). Partial co-localization can be seen between the γ-adaptin and NCS-1-ECFP, shown by the yellow in the overlay (C). The cell on the left in Ais a nontransfected cell in which the γ-adaptin localization was similar to those cells expressing NCS-1-ECFP. There was little co-localization between NCS-1-ECFP expression and the transferrin receptor (F), showing that NCS-1 was not present at significant levels on early endosomes.

https://openalex.org/W2136055108,"Metastasis-associated protein S100A4 (Mts1) induces invasiveness of primary tumors and promotes metastasis. S100A4 belongs to the family of small calcium-binding S100 proteins that are involved in different cellular processes as transducers of calcium signal. S100A4 modulates properties of tumor cells via interaction with its intracellular targets, heavy chain of non-muscle myosin and p53. Here we report identification of a new molecular target of the S100A4 protein, liprin β1. Liprin β1 belongs to the family of leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase-interacting proteins that may regulate LAR protein properties via interaction with another member of the family, liprin α1. We showed by the immunoprecipitation analysis that S100A4 interacts specifically with liprin β1 in vivo.Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated the co-localization of S100A4 and liprin β1 in the cytoplasm and particularly at the protrusion sites of the plasma membrane. We mapped the S100A4 binding site at the C terminus of the liprin β1 molecule between amino acid residues 938 and 1005. The S100A4-binding region contains two putative phosphorylation sites by protein kinase C and protein kinase CK2. S100A4-liprin β1 interaction resulted in the inhibition of liprin β1 phosphorylation by both kinases in vitro. Metastasis-associated protein S100A4 (Mts1) induces invasiveness of primary tumors and promotes metastasis. S100A4 belongs to the family of small calcium-binding S100 proteins that are involved in different cellular processes as transducers of calcium signal.

In addition, S100A4 is secreted from cells, and its extracellular activity as an angiogenic factor has been described previously (14Watanabe Y. Usuda N. Tsugane S. Kobayashi R. Hidaka H. J. Biol.

S100A4 belongs to the S100 family of small calcium-binding proteins that possess common EF-hand structures (for review, see Ref. 16Donato R. Int. J. Biochem.

S100 proteins may exist in different forms such as monomer, homodimer, or heterodimer, whereas the prevailing form is antiparallelly noncovalently packed homodimer. Recombinant and secreted forms of S100A4 adopt all these conformations including an oligomeric form (15Ambartsumian N. Klingelhofer J. Grigorian M. Christensen C. Kriajevska M. Tulchinsky E.

Calcium ions induce conformational changes in the S100 protein structures, allowing interaction with target proteins. Conformational plasticity and structural variations explain the unique ability of members of the S100 family to participate in multiple cellular processes via interaction with different targets (16Donato R.

The binding of S100A4 to its targets was characterized as a calcium-dependent interaction, which was blocked in the presence of EGTA. Recently, using the yeast two-hybrid system, the interaction of S100A4 with another S100A4 family member, S100A1, has been demonstrated (17Wang G. Rudland P.S. White M.R. Barraclough R. J. Biol.

Using mass spectrometry-based sequencing analysis, we identified liprin β1 as a protein co-immunoprecipitated in a complex with S100A4. Liprin β1 is a 105-kDa cytosolic protein that belongs to the liprin family of transmembrane tyrosine-phosphatase LAR-interacting proteins (24Serra-Pegas C. Medley Q.G. Tang M. Hart A. Streuli M. J.

Although the involvement of LAR in neuron guidance and mammary gland development has been well documented and its function in tumorigenesis was suggested, the exact biological role of liprin β1 remains unclear (25Krueger N.X.

Liprins have high sequence homology, especially at C termini, where liprin homology (LH) domains are localized. However, only α-liprins interact with LAR and regulate its cellular distribution (28Serra-Peges C. Kedersha N.L. Fazikas L. Medley Q. Debant A. Streuli M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Liprins form homodimers via the N-terminal coiled-coil region and heterodimers via three sterile α motif (SAM) domains localized at the C-terminal part of the proteins (24Serra-Pegas C. Medley Q.G.

We demonstrated interaction between S100A4 and liprin β1 in vitro andin vivo. Using blot overlay analysis, we mapped the S100A4-binding region between 938 and 1005 aa at the C terminus of liprin β1.

The Tet-on-S100A4 inducible clone of VMR-Liv cells was obtained after simultaneous transfection of cells with two plasmids, pUHD 17-2-neo and pUHD 10-3/S100A4 (32Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2034) Google Scholar), followed by the selection of clones in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418. pUHD 10-3/S100A4 contained S100A4 cDNA excised from the plasmid p271 (1Ebralidze A.

The clones were maintained in the absence or presence of doxycycline (DOX) for 24 h and screened for the inducible expression of S100A4. To create a retroviral vector expressing S100A4, the insert from plasmid p271 (1Ebralidze A. Tulchinsky E. Grigorian M. Afanasyeva A. Senin V. Revazova E. Lukanidin E.

Bank A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GP+E cells were transfected with pMV-S100A4 retroviral vector DNA harboring cDNA of S100A4 or with an empty vector, pMV-7. Successfully transfected GP+E cells were selected in the presence of 800 μg/ml G418. Virus-containing supernatants of virus-producing cell lines were used to infect VMR-Liv cells (34Markowitz D. Goff S. Bank A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Infected cells were selected on 10-cm-diameter dishes for 10 days in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418. For metabolic labeling, cells growing on tissue culture flasks (25 cm2; Nunc Inc.) were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in 2 ml of sodium phosphate-free medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and containing 5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (40 mCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.).

Polyclonal antiserum to the N-terminal peptide of liprin β1 was generated by immunization of chickens and purification on the N-liprin affinity column. CSML100 cells were grown on glass slides (Nunc Inc.) and fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. 0.2% Triton X-100 solution was used to permeabilize the cells. Antibodies were applied in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h at room temperature. For double staining, the cells were first incubated with rabbit anti-S100A4 antibodies, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG from donkey (A-21207; Molecular Probes). Next, chicken anti-N-liprin β1 antibodies were applied, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken IgG (F-4137; Sigma). Slides were mounted in Fluormount-G (Southern Biotechnology Assoc.), dried overnight, and analyzed with confocal scanning laser microscope LSM510 (Zeiss). Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and washing steps were carried out in a buffer (0.5% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma), 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3V04, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C. Cell extracts were precleared on protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). mAb HM-4 and chicken anti-liprin β1 antibodies were used as a sandwich with rabbit anti-mouse or rabbit anti-chicken antibodies. Immunoprecipitated proteins were collected on protein G-Sepharose, washed, eluted in gel loading buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed, or proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) and analyzed by standard Western blotting procedure with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL+Plus; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Bands corresponding to the labeled proteins co-immunoprecipitated with S100A4 were excised from the dried gels, and mass spectrometry analysis was performed as described previously (35Behrendt N.

Total RNA from human OHS cells was isolated as described previously (36Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63147) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription-PCR was conducted using SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Antisense primer (CTACGGTCAAACGTTTGAGTC) corresponding to the liprin β1 sequence (+3244 to +3264) (24Serra-Pegas C. Medley Q.G. Tang M. Hart A. Streuli M. J. Biol.

A full-size and two overlapping liprin β1fragments were PCR-amplified using the following sets of primers: (a) liprin β1 full size (FL-lip), CGCGGATCCATGATGAGTGATGCAAGTGACATG (+241 to +264) and CTACGGTCAAACGTTTGAGTC (+3244 to +3264), (b)N-terminal fragment (N-lip), CGCGGATCCATGATGAGTGATGCAAGTGACATG (+241 to +264) and AGTGCCGAAGGGGTTGTC (+1726 to +1743), and (c) C-terminal fragment (C-lip), CGCGGATCCTTTGGGACCCTTCCTCCC (+1678 to +1695) and CTACGGTCAAACGTTTGAGTC (+3244 to +3264). Truncated subfragments of the C-terminal fragment or fragments with internal deletions were synthesized by PCR using plasmid containingC-lip as a template. For subfragments, primers were designed as follows: (a) A-lip, CGCGGATCCTTTGGGACCCTTCCTCCC (+1678 to +1695) and ATATTGAGGGAGGCCAAT (+2413 to +2430), (b)B-lip, CGCGGATCCAACTGGGTCACTAGATGGTTG (+2386 to +2406) and CTACGGTCAAACGTTTGAGTC (+3244 to +3264), (c)Ba-lip, CGCGGATCCAACTGGGTCACTAGATGGTTG (+2386 to +2406) and GGCGATGGTATTCTCATC (+2605 to +2622), (d)Bb-lip, CGCGGATCCGAACCAAACTGTCTACGG (+2575 to +2592) and CTGTCCCAATTCCATTGG (+3001 to +3018), and (e)Bc-lip, CGCGGATCCACAGCTACTGCCAAAGTG (+2905 to +2922) and CTACGGTCAAACGTTTGAGTC (+3244 to +3264).

All synthesized fragments were cloned into pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen) and partially sequenced. Induction and purification of recombinant 6-His-tagged proteins were done according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Blot overlay was carried out as described previously (23Kriajevska M.V. Cardenas M.N. Grigorian M.S. Ambartsumian N.S. Geogiev G.P. Lukanidin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19679-19682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA. Reactions were performed in a mixture (25 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm CaCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 7.5 μg of phosphatidylserine (PKC assay), 50 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP (5,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and 1 μm Bc-lip with or without 5 μm S100A4 for 15 min at 30 °C. PKC was purchased from Roche, and 0.025 μg of PKC was applied per reaction. CK2 was purchased from New England BioLabs, and 50 units of CK2 were applied per reaction. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 25 μl of 2× SDS-gel sample buffer, and proteins were separated in 15% SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed in 5% trichloroacetic acid, dried, and exposed. To further investigate the mechanism underlying S100A4 function, we performed a search for proteins interacting with S100A4in vivo. For this purpose, we generated a S100A4-expressing DOX-inducible clone of the mouse mammary adenocarcinoma cell line VMR-Liv. Cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in the absence or presence of DOX (24 or 48 h). Immunoprecipitation was performed with polyclonal antibodies against S100A4 and non-muscle myosin. To control for the specificity of the S100A4-target interactions detected in immunoprecipitation, we used lysates from original VMR-Liv cells. After 24 h of induction, we already observed several phosphoproteins including MHC co-immunoprecipitated with S100A4 (Fig.1, lanes 8 and 9). These complexes were specific and also detectable in cells maintained in the presence of DOX for 48 h (Fig. 1, lanes 12 and13). Without DOX stimulation, we observed hardly detectable bands corresponding to the S100A4 co-immunoprecipitated proteins that were absent in lysates from parental VMR-Liv cells (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 5). That was likely due to the traces of S100A4 present in DOX-untreated VMR-Liv-Tet-on-S100A4 cells. Bands corresponding to the S100A4 co-immunoprecipitated proteins were excised from the gel, and the proteins were studied by mass spectrometry. Protein masses were determined by MALDI mass spectrometry, and final protein identification was achieved by partial sequencing using MS/MS techniques. One of the phosphoproteins with a molecular mass of 113.191 kDa was highly homologous to human liprin β1. To clone human liprin β1, we amplified liprin β1 sequences by reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA from human osteosarcoma cells. We cloned a fragment corresponding to the full-length protein (1–1005 aa) as well as two overlapping fragments matching the N-terminal coiled-coil region (N-lip, 1–501 aa) and C-terminal region (C-lip, 480–1005 aa) that contains a LH domain (24Serra-Pegas C. Medley Q.G. Tang M. Hart A. Streuli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15611-15620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed N-lip was used for the immunization of chickens. Because human and mouse liprin β1 proteins are highly homologous, affinity-purified antibodies against N terminus of human liprin β1 specifically recognized liprin β1 of both mouse and human origin (data not shown). To verify the interaction between S100A4 and liprin β1 in vivo, we performed immunoprecipitation of S100A4 and liprin β1 from two different cell systems. We chose CSML100 cells, highly metastatic mouse adenocarcinoma cells that expressed a high level of S100A4, and VMR-Liv cells infected with either control retroviral vector or the same vector harboring S100A4. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against either S100A4 or liprin β1, resolved in gel, blotted, and analyzed with both antibodies. Anti-S100A4 antibodies immunoprecipitated S100A4- liprin β1 complex from CSML100 and VMR-Liv/S100A4 cells, but not from S100A4-negative cells (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and4). Antibody against liprin β1 could precipitate the complex less efficiently and only from CSML100 cells, where the level of S100A4 expression is higher than that in VMR-Liv/S100A4 cells (Fig.2, lane 6). A previously identified S100A4 target, MHC, was co-immunoprecipitated with S100A4 (Fig. 1, lanes 8,9, 12, and 13). However, we could not detect the presence of the MHC in the liprin β1 precipitation, and, vice versa, liprin β1 was not present in the MHC-containing complexes (data not shown). To determine whether S100A4 and liprin β1 are co-localized in cells, double immunofluorescence staining of CSML100 cells with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies was performed. Both proteins appeared to be diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and displayed enhanced staining in the perinuclear region and at the protrusion sites of the plasma membrane (Fig. 3,A and B). S100A4 and liprin β1 were predominantly co-localized to the lamellipodia-like sites on plasma membrane (Fig. 3 C). Incubation with the antigen liprin β1-N completely abolished liprin β1 staining (Fig. 3 E), confirming the specificity of the generated anti-liprin β1 antibody. The specificity of anti-S100A4 staining has been confirmed previously (15Ambartsumian N. Klingelhofer J. Grigorian M. Christensen C. Kriajevska M. Tulchinsky E. Georgiev G. Berezin V. Bock E. Rygaard J. Cao R. Cao Y. Lukanidin E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4685-4695Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus, we considered these data an indication of the direct interaction between S100A4 and liprin β1 in vivo. To verify this conclusion and to confirm the direct interaction between the two proteins in vitro, we applied blot overlay analysis. Bacterial lysates containing either recombinant full-length liprin β1 or its N- or C-terminal peptides (Fig. 4) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted. Membranes were incubated with S100A4 in the presence of calcium or EGTA and stained with the anti-S100A4 antibodies. Recombinant proteins were synthesized as fused proteins containing His tag at their N termini, and the amount of the liprin β1-derived peptides on the membrane was controlled by staining with the anti-His antibodies (Fig.5 A, lanes 1–3). S100A4 interacted with full-length liprin β1 or its C-terminal fragment in calcium-dependent mode (Fig. 5 B,lanes 1–3). Interaction was completely abolished in the presence of EGTA (data not shown).Figure 5Localization of the S100A4 binding site on the C terminus of liprin β1. Equimolar amounts of recombinant liprin β1 protein fragments in bacterial lysates were run on a 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE. The gels were blotted and stained with anti-His mAb (A).

Balan I. Pawson T. Sicheri F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar and CD alignment RPS-BLAST) (Fig. 4). To map the S100A4 binding site on liprin β1, we synthesized two overlapping recombinant fragments of the C-terminal region of liprin β1 containing one or two SAM domains, A-lip and B-lip (480–730 and 716–1005 aa) (Fig. 4). Cloning of the recombinant fragments was performed by PCR by using a plasmid containing a C-terminal fragment of liprin β1 as a template (see “Experimental Procedures”). Bacterial lysates expressing A-lip or B-lip were used for blot overlay analysis. Because the all recombinant protein fragments were expressed as 6-His-fused proteins, we could control the amount of loaded peptides in bacterial lysates by Western staining with anti-His antibodies (Fig. 5 A). S100A4 interacted with the B-lip peptide containing two SAM domains, but not with A-lip, in a calcium-dependent manner (Fig. 5 B, lanes 4 and 5). To further narrow the S100A4-binding region of liprin β1, we generated three new overlapping peptides (Ba-lip, Bb-lip, and Bc-lip) containing sequences corresponding either to the second or third SAM domains or to the C-terminal tip of liprin β1 (716–794, 779–926, and 889–1005 aa, respectively) (Fig. 4). It is clear from Fig. 5 B that S100A4 interacted only with the C-terminal tip of liprin β1 (lanes 6–8). We concluded that the S100A4 binding site is localized between 889 and 1005 aa on the liprin β1 molecule. To confirm this conclusion, we prepared four derivatives of the C-terminal fragment of liprin β1 containing internal deletions between 854 and 880, 878 and 917, 916 and 938, and 936 and 1003 aa (see the schema in Fig. 4). Blot overlay analysis with these recombinant proteins confirmed the localization of the S100A4 binding site between 938 and 1005 aa of liprin β1 (F"

Particularly important is the development of novel anti-anthrax vaccines, devoid of the current side effects. A novel class of immunogenic bacterial proteins consists of dodecamers homologous to the DNA-binding protein of Escherichia coli (Dps). Two Dps homologous genes are present in the B. anthracis genome. The crystal structures of these two proteins (Dlp-1 and Dlp-2) have been determined and are presented here. They are sphere-like proteins with an internal cavity. We also show that they act as ferritins and are thus involved in iron uptake and regulation, a fundamental function during bacterial growth."

This negative feedback regulation of DnaA activity is proposed to play a crucial role in the replication cycle. We here report that the mutant protein DnaA R334A is inert to hydrolysis of bound ATP, although its affinities for ATP and ADP remain unaffected.

Chromosomal duplication occurs only once during the cell cycle and is regulated mainly by ingenious controls that act during the initiation of replication (1.Diffley J.F.X.

The Escherichia coliinitiator protein, DnaA, binds to the chromosomal origin of replication (oriC) and promotes a series of reactions leading to the formation of a replication fork (4.Kornberg A.

This protein has high affinity for ATP and ADP, but only the ATP-bound form (ATP-DnaA) can initiate replication at oriC. ATP-DnaA (but not ADP-DnaA) causes local unwinding of the oriC DNA duplex, which creates a site of entry for the DnaB helicase. DnaB helicase loaded on the unwound site forms a complex with DnaG primase and expands the single-stranded region.

E. coli DNA is modified at the adenine residue of the palindromic sequence GATC by DNA-adenine methyltransferase, but newly replicated DNA remains hemimethylated until acted upon by DNA-adenine methyltransferase (9.Campbell J.L. Kleckner N. Cell. 1990; 62: 967-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The hemimethylated oriC locus is bound by the protein SeqA, which likely inhibits the initiation of replication until full methylation is re-established (10.Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N.

Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In vitro, ATP hydrolysis is promoted by the pol III β subunit that is loaded onto DNA (the so-called sliding clamp) and by the protein IdaB (13.Katayama T. Crooke E. J. Biol.

During processive DNA synthesis driven by the pol III holoenzyme, the ring-shaped pol III β subunit dimer encircles the post-replicated DNA duplex or the heteroduplex formed by an RNA primer on a DNA template (6.Kelman Z.

The requirement of the DNA-bound form of the sliding clamp for DnaA-ATP hydrolysis ensures the timely coupling between DnaA inactivation and the replication cycle (14.Katayama T. Kubota T.

Crooke E. Sekimizu K. Cell. 1998; 94: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and more recently has been associated with a new protein, Hda (16.Kato J. Katayama T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4253-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The inactivation of DnaA has been termed RIDA (for regulatoryinactivation of DnaA) (14.Katayama T. Kubota T. Kurokawa K. Crooke E. Sekimizu K. Cell. 1998; 94: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), which is characterized by a decrease in the level of ATP-DnaA following initiation (14.Katayama T. Kubota T. Kurokawa K. Crooke E. Sekimizu K. Cell. 1998; 94: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 17.Kurokawa K. Nishida S. Emoto A. Sekimizu K. Katayama T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6642-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In a synchronized culture, it takes ∼15–20 min for ATP-DnaA levels (representing 80–90% of the total amount of ATP- and ADP-bound DnaA) to decrease to the basal level (∼40% in the strain background examined). Thus, the sequestration of oriCby SeqA and the RIDA system presumably complement each other in defining the inter-initiation time of the cell cycle (3.Katayama T. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18.Katayama T. Sekimizu K. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19.Boye E. Løbner-Olesen A. Skarstad K. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition, DnaA is titrated by the datA locus, which is a site at 94.7 min that contains a DnaA box cluster, providing another means to repress DnaA activity and to prevent overinitiation (3.Katayama T. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20.Kitagawa R. Ozaki T. Moriya S. Ogawa T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3032-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,21.Katayama T. Fujimitsu K. Ogawa T. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Some dnaA mutants that lack a tight affinity for adenine nucleotides exhibit overinitiation of replication (3.Katayama T. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Based on an assumption that the control of DnaA activity by bound nucleotides plays a crucial role in controlling initiation, an explanation for overinitiation is that the mutant DnaA does not undergo inactivation by RIDA and continues to promote initiation. If this is the case, a prediction that follows is that overinitiation could also be caused by a mutant DnaA that has high affinity for adenine nucleotides but is defective for the hydrolysis of bound ATP by RIDA. Such a mutant, however, has not yet been reported. Recently, we found that the arginine 334 residue of DnaA (Arg-334) is required for ATP hydrolysis, because substitution of arginine by histidine (the R334H mutation) inhibits RIDA and the intrinsic ATPase activity of DnaA (15.Su'etsugu M. Kawakami H. Kurokawa K. Kubota T. Takata M. Katayama T. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, this mutant protein is unstable in its ability to promote initiation (15.Su'etsugu M. Kawakami H. Kurokawa K. Kubota T. Takata M. Katayama T. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22.Guo L. Katayama T. Seyama Y. Sekimizu K. Miki T. FEMS Microbiol.

Microbiol. 2000; 35: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the R334A substitution also inhibits RIDA and the intrinsic ATPase activity of DnaA and that the expression of the DnaA R334A protein causes the overinitiation of chromosomal replication. These findings emphasize the importance of the Arg-334 residue in ATP hydrolysis and the significance of bound nucleotides in the control of DnaA activity by RIDA, and hence in the regulation of replication in E. coli. Arginine 334 is a conserved basic residue found in the Box VIII motif of members of the AAA+ protein family, which includes chaperone-like ATPases (24.Neuwald A.F. Aravid L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the motifs conserved among AAA+ proteins and the structure of one such protein (25.Liu J. Smith C.L. DeRyckere D. DeAngelis K. Martin G.S. Berger J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), the archaeal Pyrobaculum aerophilum Cdc6 protein, we constructed a model of the tertiary structure of the DnaA ATP-binding domain (domain III) by the homology-modeling method. This model provides an explanation for the possible role of the Arg-334 residue in ATP hydrolysis. Previously, the intrinsic ATPase activity of another DnaA mutant protein, DnaA E204Q, was reported to be only one-third that of the wild-type DnaA (26.Mizuzhima T. Nishida S. Kurokawa K. Katayama T.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6642-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) except that 0.2% glycerol was used instead of glucose. For the selection of plasmids, tetracycline (15 μg/ml) and/or ampicillin (100 μg/ml) were included in these media unless otherwise noted. Other media and plasmids have been described (34.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Site-specific mutagenesis was performed using the method described (29.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). Briefly, using M13mp19 DNA that carries the dnaA-coding region flanked by the BamHI and HindIII sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively (22.Guo L. Katayama T. Seyama Y. Sekimizu K. Miki T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 176: 357-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), uracil-containing single-stranded DNA was prepared with BW313 (ung-1) cells. For introduction of the R334A mutation, the resulting DNA was hybridized with a primer, 5′-GATCTAACGTAGCTGAGCTGGAAG-3′, the complementary DNA strand was synthesized in vitro, and the resulting double-stranded DNA was introduced into JM109 cells. The mutation was confirmed by sequencing. DNA fragments isolated by digestion with BamHI and HindIII were used for the plasmid constructions described above. All procedures were essentially the same as those for purification of the DnaA R334H protein, as previously described by Takata et al. (23.Takata M. Guo L. Katayama T. Hase M. Seyama Y. Miki T. Sekimizu K. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, KA450 cells carrying pHS284-2 were grown in 15 liter of LB medium at 37 °C, expression of the mutant dnaA gene was induced by adding 1% d-arabinose to log phase cells, and incubation was continued for 1.5 h. Ammonium sulfate at a final concentration of 0.22 g/ml was added to cleared lysates, and the resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in buffer C (35.Sekimizu K. Yung B.Y.-M. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7136-7140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and dialyzed against the same buffer. Insoluble materials were collected by centrifugation, washed with 0.6m ammonium sulfate, and dissolved with buffer C containing 0.6 m ammonium sulfate and 4 m guanidine HCl. A monomer fraction (fraction IV) of DnaA R334A protein was obtained by gel filtration chromatography using Superose 12 (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer D (35.Sekimizu K. Yung B.Y.-M. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7136-7140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A protein extract (fraction II) prepared from WM433 (dnaA204) was used to monitor in vitro DnaA-dependent minichromosomal replication, as described (28.Fuller R.S. Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7370-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The buffer consisted of 40 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 40 mm phosphocreatine, 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm each of GTP, CTP, and UTP, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 100 μg/ml creatine kinase, and 7% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol (molecular weight 30,000–70,000). Reactions (25 μl) prepared in the above buffer contained 240 μg of fraction II, 200 ng (600 pmol) of minichromosome M13E10 RFI DNA, dNTPs at 0.1 mm each, and DnaA proteins as indicated. [α-32P]dTTP (50–150 cpm/pmol) was included to enable the subsequent measurement of DNA synthesis by liquid scintillation counting of acid-insoluble materials. The ATP or ADP binding activity of DnaA proteins was determined by a nitrocellulose filter-retention assay (36.Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). DnaA protein (2 pmol) was incubated with [α-32P]ATP or [3H]ADP at 0 °C for 15 min in 40 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tricine-KOH, pH 8.3, 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.3 mm EDTA, 7 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.007% Triton X-100, and 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Samples were passed through nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore HA, 0.45 μm). After washing, radioactivity retained on the filters was counted in a liquid scintillation counter as described (36.Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). RIDA-active fractions II and III were prepared from WM433 as described (14.Katayama T. Kubota T. Kurokawa K. Crooke E. Sekimizu K. Cell. 1998; 94: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Briefly, fraction II was prepared by ammonium sulfate precipitation (0.24 g/ml) of fraction I proteins, and the activity was further concentrated as fraction III by the separation of proteins by DE52 column chromatography. These fractions were incubated with [α-32P]ATP-bound DnaA protein and the oriC plasmid M13E10 in the same buffer as that used for in vitro replication with WM433 extracts. DnaA protein with bound nucleotides was isolated by immunoprecipitation, and radiolabeled nucleotides were separated by polyethylenimine (PEI) cellulose thin layer chromatography and quantified as described (14.Katayama T. Kubota T. Kurokawa K. Crooke E. Sekimizu K. Cell. 1998; 94: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This assay was done as described (23.Takata M. Guo L. Katayama T. Hase M. Seyama Y. Miki T. Sekimizu K. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar,36.Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Briefly, buffer (50 μl) containing 60 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 8 mm magnesium acetate, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 400 ng of the pBS oriC minichromosome (3.7 kb), 0.32 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm ATP was preincubated at 38 or 28 °C for 1 min. ATP-bound DnaA protein was then added and incubation was continued for 3 min at 38 °C or 6 min at 28 °C, followed by incubation with P1 nuclease (10 units; Yamasa Co.) for 25 s at the same temperature. After the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.3% SDS, DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, digested in buffer with ScaI, and analyzed by agarose (1%) gel electrophoresis. DNA fragments of 2.1 and 1.6 kb are generated by this restriction enzyme when open complexes are formed, and thus the oriC site is digested with P1 nuclease (23.Takata M. Guo L. Katayama T. Hase M. Seyama Y. Miki T. Sekimizu K. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The extent of open complex is indicated by the percentage of these fragments. Gels were stained with GelStar (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), and DNA band intensities were quantified by densitometric scanning of photographic negatives (Polaroid, Cambridge, MA). Cells were exponentially grown in supplemented TG medium and harvested by centrifugation of 1.5-ml aliquots. Total DNA was prepared by the method described by Atlung and Hansen (37.Atlung T. Hansen F. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6537-6545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets stored at −20 °C were thawed, resuspended in 270 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 150 μg of lysozyme and 150 μg of proteinase K. The lysate was heated at 65 °C for 2 h, and nucleic acids were precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 100 μl of TE buffer. DNA (2 μg) was digested withEcoRI and PstI, and the fragments were separated by electrophoresis (50 V) on a 20-cm 0.7% agarose gel. The gel was soaked in 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 40 min, photographed, soaked in 0.37% HCl for 10 min, washed twice in deionized water, and soaked for 40 min in 0.5 m NaOH, 1.5 m NaCl solution and for 60 min in 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 3 mNaCl solution. DNA was then transferred to a GeneScreen Plus filter (DuPont, Wilmington, DE) by the capillary method (34.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After transfer, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed again to verify a complete transfer of the DNA. The filter was hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes for the oriC andterC regions. After washing, the filter was exposed on an imaging plate (Fuji Film, Japan) and the intensity of the bands was quantified by using BAS2500 (Fuji Film). Each gel also included DNA samples prepared from KA413 (dnaA46) cells incubated for 2 h at 42 °C, which allows sufficient time for replication of the entire chromosome, to normalize the hybridization signals. For preparation of the oriC or terC probes, M13mpRE85 was digested with EcoRI and PstI and pKA58 withEcoRI and HindIII. Restriction fragments (0.5 kb from M13mpRE85 and 1.0 kb from pKA58) were isolated from 0.7% agarose with the QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and resuspended in TE buffer. Approximately 25 ng of oriC andterC fragments were labeled with the Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Total counts of 108 cpm were obtained for both probes. Cells were cultured in tryptone medium with 3 μCi of [3H]thymine (Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA) at a concentration of 25 μg/ml (38.Katayama T. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12698-12703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acid-insoluble materials were prepared with chilled 5% trichloroacetic acid, and radioactivity was measured with a scintillation counter. Cells were labeled by growth in supplemented TG medium containing 0.4 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate as described (17.Kurokawa K. Nishida S. Emoto A. Sekimizu K. Katayama T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6642-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Briefly, cleared lysates (750 μl) from aliquots (2 ml) of the culture were prepared and mixed with anti-DnaA antiserum (5 μl) that had been pre-incubated in 100 μl of a cleared lysate (30 mg/ml protein) of KP7364 (ΔdnaA::spec) for 30 min at 0 °C. Protein A-Sepharose (60 μl; 50% slurry) was added, suspended for 30 min at 2 °C, and washed repeatedly in chilled buffers. After removal of the final washing solution, immunoprecipitates were extracted in a solution (20 μl) of 1 m HCOOH and 5 mm each of ATP, ADP, and AMP. Radiolabeled nucleotides were separated by PEI-cellulose thin layer chromatography and quantified as described (14.Katayama T. Kubota T. Kurokawa K. Crooke E. Sekimizu K. Cell. 1998; 94: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The homology study was performed using the homology module of the INSIGHT II molecular modeling package (MSI/Biosym, San Diego, CA). Because the AAA+ modules of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc6 protein are similar to that of DnaA (24.Neuwald A.F. Aravid L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the atomic coordinates for the P. aerophilum Cdc6 homolog, whose structure has been solved by x-ray crystallography (25.Liu J. Smith C.L. DeRyckere D. DeAngelis K. Martin G.S. Berger J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), were obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank. For structurally conserved regions (SCRs), which are located in α-helices and β-strands common to DnaA domain III and P. aerophilum Cdc6 domains I and II, the corresponding coordinates in the P. aerophilum Cdc6 protein were used as a structural template. Loop structures connecting SCRs were selected from ten loop coordinates in the homology module. The initial DnaA"

The inactivation of multiple pathways that positively regulate senescence are required for immortalization. To identify these pathways in an unbiased manner, we performed DNA microarray analyses to assess the expression of 20,000 genes in human prostate epithelial cells (HPECs) passaged to senescence. These gene expression patterns were then compared with those of HPECs immortalized with the humanPapillomavirus 16 E7 oncoprotein. Senescent cells display gene expression patterns that reflect their nonproliferative, differentiated phenotype and express secretory proteases and extracellular matrix components. A comparison of genes transcriptionally up-regulated in senescence to those in which expression is significantly down-regulated in immortalized HPECs identified three genes: the chemokine BRAK,DOC1, and a member of the insulin-like growth factor axis,IGFBP-3. Expression of these genes is found to be uniformly lost in human prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts, and previously, their inactivation was documented in tumor samples. Thus, these genes may function in novel pathways that regulate senescence and are inactivated during immortalization. These changes may be critical not only in allowing cells to bypass senescence in vitrobut in the progression of prostate cancer in vivo.

Normal primary cells proliferate in culture for a limited number of population doublings prior to undergoing terminal growth arrest and acquiring a senescent phenotype (1.Hayflick L. Exp. Cell Res. 1965; 25: 585-621Crossref Scopus (5489) Google Scholar). Senescent cells are resistant to mitogen-induced proliferation, express senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), 1The abbreviations used are: SA-β-galsenescence-associated β-galactosidaseHPEChuman prostate epithelial cellESTexpressed sequence tagqRT-PCRquantitative reverse transcriptase PCRHPVhuman papillomavirusSAMsignificance analysis of microarraysIGFinsulin-like growth factorIGFBPIGF-binding proteinECMextracellular matrix1The abbreviations used are: SA-β-galsenescence-associated β-galactosidaseHPEChuman prostate epithelial cellESTexpressed sequence tagqRT-PCRquantitative reverse transcriptase PCRHPVhuman papillomavirusSAMsignificance analysis of microarraysIGFinsulin-like growth factorIGFBPIGF-binding proteinECMextracellular matrix and assume a characteristic enlarged, flattened morphology (reviewed in Ref. 2.Campisi J.

With progressive cell divisions, errors in DNA replication, oxidative metabolism, and environmental insults generate somatic mutations and place cells at risk for oncogenic transformation. Accumulating data suggest that the terminal arrest associated with cellular senescence represents a major barrier, analogous to apoptosis, that cells must circumvent to become malignant (3.Campisi J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: S27-S31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar).

Kim S. Lim C.S. Rubio M. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1619-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Cellular senescence also can be induced prematurely by a variety of stimuli including DNA damage, perturbations of chromatin structure, and overexpression of mitogenic signals including E2F1, oncogenic Ha-ras, Raf, or MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) (5.Dimri G.P. Itahana K. Acosta M. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 6.Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W.

Two genes implicated in and critical for the induction and maintenance of senescence are pRb and p53 (3.Campisi J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: S27-S31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Overexpression of downstream members of these pathways including p16, the p53 effector molecule p21, and p14ARF can elicit cell cycle arrest and senescence (5.Dimri G.P. Itahana K. Acosta M. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 9.Vogt M. Haggblom C. Yeargin J. Christiansen-Weber T. Haas M.

These gain of function experiments demonstrating that senescence can be prematurely induced, however, do not directly address the complex pathways regulating senescence in unmanipulated, serially passaged, normal primary cells. These mechanisms may significantly differ. For example in fibroblasts, the overexpression of E2F1 leads to senescence; however, E2F1 expression is actually repressed as unmanipulated cells senesce (11.Dimri G.P. Hara E. Campisi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16180-16186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of the p16/pRb and p53 pathways is necessary to bypass senescence; however, this is insufficient for immortalization. Telomerase activation is also required, although the overexpression of telomerase alone is not sufficient to confer immortalization in epithelial cells (12.Kiyono T. Foster S.A. Koop J.I. McDougall J.K. Galloway D.A. Klingelhutz A.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). In addition, genetic analyses of immortalized prostate epithelial and other cell types reveal that a number of consistent genetic alterations are required, including the amplification of chromosome 20q and 8q (13.Jarrard D.F. Sarkar S. Shi Y. Yeager T.R. Magrane G. Kinoshita H. Nassif N. Meisner L. Newton M.A. Waldman F.M. Reznikoff C.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2957-2964PubMed Google Scholar, 14.El Gedaily A. Bubendorf L. Willi N. Fu W. Richter J. Moch H. Mihatsch M.J. Sauter G. Gasser T.C. Prostate. 2001; 46: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Based on these findings and other microcell transfer experiments, it has been proposed that alterations in multiple pathways are required for the acquisition of the immortal phenotype (15.Sasaki M. Honda T. Yamada H. Wake N. Barrett J.C. Oshimura M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6090-6093PubMed Google Scholar). In a series of classical experiments the fusion of different immortalized cell lines were shown to restore senescence, and these cell lines could be sorted into four complementation groups. This work implies that there are a limited number of pathways critical to senescence, that these pathways must be activated to initiate senescence, and that they can override other transforming genetic events to yield a senescent phenotype (16.Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6042-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Genes that have been implicated in senescence are also targeted in the development and progression of human prostate and bladder cancer. The alteration of the p16/pRb pathway in 85% of primary prostate cancers is a predictor of adverse clinical outcome. 2D. F. Jarrard, J. Modder, C. Sandefur, Y. Shi, D. Heisey, S. Schwarze, and A. Friedl, submitted for publication.2D. F. Jarrard, J. Modder, C. Sandefur, Y. Shi, D. Heisey, S. Schwarze, and A. Friedl, submitted for publication. The tumor suppressor p53 is one of the most commonly mutated genes in human cancer and is altered frequently in advanced prostate and bladder cancers (18.Heidenberg H.B. Sesterhenn I.A.

Several lines of evidence suggest that bypassing senescence may also be important in cancer progression in vivo. Immortalized colon cancer cell lines can only be established from large, pathologically advanced lesions (20.Newbold R.F. Cuthbert A.P. Themis M. Trott D.A. Blair A.L. Li W. Toxicol. Lett. 1993; 67: 211-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). When noninvasive papillary bladder neoplasms are grown in culture, they uniformly senesce and maintain an intact p16/pRb pathway (19.Yeager T.R. DeVries S. Jarrard D.F. Kao C. Nakada S.Y. Moon T.D.

In contrast, cells cultured from myoinvasive, aggressive transitional cell bladder carcinomas do not senesce, have alterations of the p53 pathway, and inactivate either p16 or pRb. Furthermore, prostate tumors that grow as xenografts have been generated solely from advanced, metastatic cancers (22.Klein K.A. Reiter R.E. Redula J. Moradi H. Zhu X.L. Brothman A.R. Lamb D.J. Marcelli M. Belldegrun A. Witte O.N. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). These results suggest that bypassing senescence is important in cancer progression and occurs late in the progression of cancers in vivo. To gain insight into novel pathways involved in bypassing senescence, we developed a model in which transcript levels for more than 20,000 unique sequences were tracked in replicate cultures as human prostate epithelial cells senesced or were immortalized. A major advantage of this approach is that it avoids exogenous gene expression for the induction of premature senescence that can result in biased or aberrant results. Using this strategy, we have identified several genes,BRAK, DOC1, and IGFBP-3, that are up-regulated in senescence and inactivated during immortalization. We found, utilizing quantitative RT-PCR, that these genes are significantly down-regulated in human prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts. Interestingly, all of these genes have been previously implicated in the tumorigenic phenotype (23.Frederick M.J. Henderson Y. Xu X. Deavers M.T. Sahin A.A. Wu H. Lewis D.E. El-Naggar A.K.

These data support the concept that pathways activated at senescence and selectively inactivated with immortalization are important in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Furthermore, these results provide an important effort in cataloging genes altered in senescence, a biologically relevant model of aging. Prostate tissue was obtained under an approved Internal Review Board protocol from men (ages 44–66) undergoing cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics. Histology confirmed that no bladder or prostate cancer was present in the tissues harvested for our studies. Prostate epithelial cultures were established as described previously (13.Jarrard D.F.

Prostate tissues were minced with a scalpel, digested in a solution containing 500 units/ml collagenase (Sigma), and plated on collagen-coated plates. Cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with regular insulin, 0.25 units/ml; hydrocortisone, 1 μg/ml; human transferrin, 5 μg/ml; dextrose, 2.7 mg/ml; nonessential amino acids, 0.1 mm; penicillin, 100 units/ml; streptomycin,100 μg/ml; l-glutamine, 2 mm; cholera toxin, 10 ng/ml; bovine pituitary extract, 25 μg/ml; and 1% fetal bovine serum (26.Reznikoff C.A.

Cells were passaged when confluent after incubation with trypsin-EDTA. Proliferating cells were harvested 2 days following the first passage. Pre-senescent cells were harvested when cell growth ceased, 1–5% of all cells appeared morphologically circular, flattened and enlarged, and SA-β-gal expression was negative. Terminally senescent cells were harvested when >60% appeared morphologically senescent and expressed high levels of SA-β-gal. Infections and characterization of HPEC cell lines was carried out as described (13.Jarrard D.F. Sarkar S. Shi Y. Yeager T.R. Magrane G. Kinoshita H. Nassif N. Meisner L. Newton M.A. Waldman F.M. Reznikoff C.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2957-2964PubMed Google Scholar). We used a retrovirus construct carrying either the HPV16 E6 and/or E7 gene(s) as well as a gentamicin resistance cassette (received from Dr. D. Galloway, Seattle, WA) (27.Halbert C.L. Demers G.W. Galloway D.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 473-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subconfluent proliferating HPECs were infected with 103-105 infectious viral units at pre-passage (∼5 × 105 cells/100-mm dish) in 3 ml of 1% fetal bovine serum, F-12+ containing 4 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma). After 6 h, the virus-containing medium was exchanged, and infected cells were selected with 50 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for a minimum of 7 days. Immortalized cell lines were screened for HPV16 E6 and/or E7 protein expression and loss of p53 and pRB by Western blot analysis. All immortalized lines were passaged in 1% fetal bovine serum F-12+ for well over 20 times to confirm their immortality. Microarray manufacture and hybridizations were carried out in accordance with previously published methods available at (28.DeRisi J. Penland L. Brown P.O. Bittner M.L. Meltzer P.S. Ray M. Chen Y. Su Y.A. Trent J.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 457-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). For this set of experiments we used DNA microarrays with either 41,000 or 47,000 spots representing over 20,000 unique human genes and ESTs. For each hybridization, 2 μg of poly(A) mRNA from each sample was reverse-transcribed and labeled with fluorescence-tagged nucleotides (Cy3 for the reference sample, Cy5 for the experimental sample). Samples were hybridized against a common reference pool of mRNA derived from a panel of human cell lines as described previously (29.Ross D.T. Scherf U. Eisen M.B. Perou C.M. Rees C. Spellman P. Iyer V. Jeffrey S.S. Van de Rijn M. Waltham M. Pergamenschikov A. Lee J.C. Lashkari D. Shalon D. Myers T.G. Weinstein J.N. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). Hybridizations were carried out for 16 to 18 h at 65 °C, and the arrays were washed. After drying, the microarrays were scanned with a confocal laser GenePix microarray scanner (Axon Instruments) and analyzed with GenePix software. After visual inspection, spots of poor quality were flagged and excluded from analysis. Data files containing fluorescence ratios were entered into the Stanford Microarray Data Base, and compiled experiments were further analyzed with hierarchical clustering software and visualized with Treeview software (30.Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13204) Google Scholar). Prior to cluster analysis, gene entries were filtered to select those with >2.5-fold changes in signal intensity when comparing proliferating cells to pre-senescent, terminally senescent, and immortalized cell lines on at least one-third of the array samples, with fluorescent intensity in each channel that was greater than 1.6 times the local background. The identities of spotted cDNAs are based on information available in UniGene cluster Build 137 (June, 2001). 3Website is ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/repository/unigene. Genes with significant expression changes in response to senescence and immortalization in normal prostate epithelial cells were identified using the significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) procedure (31.Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9751) Google Scholar). The changes in gene expression for any single gene as measured in several array experiments provide a statistically testable measure of robustness, regardless of the magnitude of change in expression. The SAM procedure computes a two-sample T-statistic (e.g.proliferating versus senescent HPECs) for the normalized log ratios of gene expression levels for each gene. It thresholds the T-statistics to provide a “significant” gene list and provides an estimate of the false discovery rate (the percent of genes identified by chance alone) from randomly permuted data. For the experiments described in our study, the raw expression ratio data set was filtered, using the program Cluster, for genes in which transcript levels differ from their median value by at least 1.5-fold in androgen-treated cells compared with controls in at least two experiments (with not more than 30% of measurements discarded because of poor data quality for each entry). We selected a data set in which 0.5 is the median number of likely false positive genes (false detection rate of 0.088%) for further analysis. We selected this value because it provided statistical assurance that most genes in the set were significantly altered but was not so stringent as to exclude genes of biological interest. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) and treated with DNase, and 1 μg was used to prepare cDNA. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed by monitoring in real time the increase in fluorescence of the SYBR green dye as described using a iCycler detection system (Bio-Rad) (32.Wittwer C.T. Herrmann M.G. Moss A.A. Rasmussen R.P. BioTechniques. 1997; 22 (134–138): 130-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 33.Morrison T.B. Weis J.J. Wittwer C.T. BioTechniques. 1998; 24 (960, 962): 954-958PubMed Google Scholar). For comparison of transcript levels between samples, a standard curve of cycle thresholds for several serial dilutions of a cDNA sample was established. This value was then used to calculate the relative abundance of each gene. These values were then normalized to the relative amounts of 18S cDNA. All PCR reactions were performed in duplicate. The sequences of the primers used for PCR analysis are available upon request. Genome-wide RNA expression analysis of serially passaged primary human prostate epithelial cells (HPECs) and HPV16 E7 immortalized HPECs was performed with DNA microarrays representing over 20,000 distinct human genes and ESTs. To identify genes induced at senescence and inactivated at immortalization, HPEC cultures derived from three separate patients were analyzed at three defined stages in each patient's life span. Cells harvested in their first passage and growing exponentially were defined as proliferating. Pre-senescent cells were harvested when growth was halted, but the cells had not yet expressed the morphologic characteristics of senescence and were not yet SA-β-gal positive. We have previously shown that this is a distinct point at which cells transiently elevate the protein levels of selected cell cycle inhibitory genes, and it appears critical in signaling the onset of senescence (34.Schwarze S.R. Shi Y. Jarrard D.F. Oncogene. 2002; 20: 8184-8192Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). At terminal senescence, >60% of HPECs expressed SA-β-gal and had acquired an enlarged, flattened morphology (13.Jarrard D.F. Sarkar S. Shi Y. Yeager T.R. Magrane G. Kinoshita H. Nassif N. Meisner L. Newton M.A. Waldman F.M. Reznikoff C.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2957-2964PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Schwarze S.R. Shi Y. Jarrard D.F. Oncogene. 2002; 20: 8184-8192Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Three independently proliferating HPEC cultures were then immortalized utilizing HPV16 E7 retrovirus. We have used this molecular tool previously to dissect the genetic events involved in bypassing senescence (13.Jarrard D.F. Sarkar S. Shi Y. Yeager T.R. Magrane G. Kinoshita H. Nassif N. Meisner L. Newton M.A. Waldman F.M. Reznikoff C.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2957-2964PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Reznikoff C.A. Belair C. Savelieva E. Zhai Y. Pfeifer K. Yeager T. Thompson K.J. DeVries S. Bindley C. Newton M.A. Sekhon G. Waldman F. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2227-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The E7 oncoprotein acts, in part, by inactivating the pRb/p16 pathway and, via the binding of p21, the p53 pathway, thus recapitulating several genetic alterations commonly observed in prostate tumors (13.Jarrard D.F. Sarkar S. Shi Y. Yeager T.R. Magrane G. Kinoshita H. Nassif N. Meisner L. Newton M.A. Waldman F.M. Reznikoff C.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2957-2964PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Heidenberg H.B. Sesterhenn I.A. Gaddipati J.P. Weghorst C.M. Buzard G.S. Moul J.W. Srivastava S. J. Urol. 1995; 154: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). HPV E7 immortalized cells are non-tumorigenic (36.Puthenveettil J.A. Frederickson S.M. Reznikoff C.A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1123-1131PubMed Google Scholar), making them an applicable model with which to isolate genes associated with the immortalization phenotype. However, because of some of the diverse activities of the HPV oncoproteins, we note that not all targets relevant to bypassing senescence will be identified utilizing this approach. Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from each of these experimental samples, reverse-transcribed, labeled with Cy-5, and hybridized in comparison with a common reference pool of cDNA (labeled with Cy-3) (29.Ross D.T. Scherf U. Eisen M.B. Perou C.M. Rees C. Spellman P. Iyer V. Jeffrey S.S. Van de Rijn M. Waltham M. Pergamenschikov A. Lee J.C. Lashkari D. Shalon D. Myers T.G. Weinstein J.N. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). The determination of genes that significantly differed in expression levels between cellular phenotypes was made utilizing the analytical tool SAM (31.Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9751) Google Scholar). A comparison of proliferating to terminally senescent HPECs generated 262 unique entries using SAM, of which 93 were induced at senescence (51 of known function) and 159 were repressed (77 of known function). Complete details and transcript identities for all outputs can be accessed in the supplemental data (Supplemental Figs. 1 and 2). SAM outputs comparing proliferating to pre-senescent cells identified no genes with significant induction in expression in pre-senescent cultures but did find 101 genes in which expression levels were repressed. These 101 genes also displayed repressed transcript levels in terminally senescent cultures. The results generated by SAM were filtered to remove ESTs and genes of unknown function. The remaining genes were then classified based on their cellular function and placed into one or more related groups. Consistent with a nonproliferative senescent state, 28 of the 77 known genes that were repressed at senescence are positive growth regulators or transcription factors involved in promoting cell cycle progression. An additional 28 repressed genes are directly involved in DNA replication, repair or mitosis. Of greater interest to us were those genes induced as cells progressed to terminal senescence as these genes may lend insights into the induction of senescence. It has been postulated that p16 and p53 function as tumor suppressors, in part, by inducing senescence pathways (37.Reznikoff C.A. Yeager T.R. Belair C.D. Savelieva E. Puthenveettil J.A. Stadler W.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2886-2890PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported at the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p16 protein level, a known marker of senescent cells, is elevated at senescence (34.Schwarze S.R. Shi Y. Jarrard D.F. Oncogene. 2002; 20: 8184-8192Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this study, we found an ∼50-fold increase in p16 mRNA at senescence, suggesting that p16 protein increases are due, at least in part, to increased transcription. Transcript levels of other negative growth regulators were also increased including the p53-regulated targets BTG2, p21, IGFBP-3, and mdm2 (Fig. 1 A), suggesting elevated p53 activity at senescence. Overexpression of BTG2 (38.Guardavaccaro D. Corrente G. Covone F. Micheli L. D'Agnano I. Starace G. Caruso M. Tirone F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1797-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), p21 (39.McConnell B.B. Starborg M. Brookes S. Peters G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 351-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), IGFBP-3 (25.Grimberg A. Cohen P. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), and even mdm2 in normal diploid cells (40.Brown D.R. Thomas C.A. Deb S.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2513-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) can result in G0/1 cell cycle arrest. These p53-inducible genes may reflect the participation of p53 in regulating the onset of senescence, lending further insight into senescence-associated p53 targets. Senescent cells show permanent growth arrest and express markers associated with terminal differentiation. Consistent with this phenotype, 15 of 51 genes induced in senescent cells are associated with differentiation, 10 of which are commonly expressed in neuronal tissue (Fig. 1 A). These genes may be indicative of the terminally differentiated phenotype rather than the induction of a neuronal phenotype as senescent HPECs do not resemble the elongated, spindle-shaped cells characteristic of neuronal cells in culture (13.Jarrard D.F. Sarkar S. Shi Y. Yeager T.R. Magrane G. Kinoshita H. Nassif N. Meisner L. Newton M.A. Waldman F.M. Reznikoff C.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2957-2964PubMed Google Scholar). Senescent HPECs also acquire a phenotype in which extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading proteases, growth factors, and other inflammatory cytokines are produced (41.Krtolica A. Parrinello S. Lockett S. Desprez P.Y. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12072-12077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). 16 of the 51 genes induced at senescence code for ECM proteins and matrix proteases (Supplemental Fig. 1). This group includes transcripts for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 2, matrix metalloproteinase 2, and microfibrillar-associated protein 2, and their respective increases (5.3-, 4.9-, and 4.3-fold increase by cDNA array, respectively) are among the highest we observed. Several other transcripts encoding ECM proteins (CSPG3, COL1A1, and fibronectin) and proteases (PAPPA and cathepsin F) are also induced (2.3- and 4.3-fold by cDNA array, respectively). Senescent cells produce extracellular proteases that promote matrix and basement membrane degradation, changes that are thought to contribute to the aging process in vivo (42.Campisi J. J. Am. Geriatr. Soc. 1997; 45: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that senescence is associated with significant alterations"

Here we assess the significance of the Arg-95 to Trp gain-of-function mutation in the v-Src SH3 domain through comparisons of Src−/− fibroblasts transformed with either Prague C v-Src or a point mutant (v-Src-RT) containing a normal (Arg-95) SH3 domain. Both v-Src isoforms exhibited equivalent kinase activity, enhanced Src−/− cell motility, and stimulated cell growth in both low serum and soft agar. The stability of a v-Src·FAK signaling complex and FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-861 and Tyr-925 were reduced in v-Src-RT- compared with v-Src-transformed cells. v-Src but not v-Src-RT promoted Src−/− cell invasion through a reconstituted Matrigel basement membrane barrier and v-Src co-localized with FAK and β1 integrin at invadopodia. In contrast, v-Src-RT exhibited a partial perinuclear and focal contact distribution in Src−/− cells. Adenovirus-mediated FAK overexpression promoted v-Src-RT recruitment to invadopodia, the formation of a v-Src-RT·FAK signaling complex, and reversed the v-Src-RT invasion deficit. Adenovirus-mediated inhibition of FAK blocked v-Src-stimulated cell invasion.

Highly transforming strains of Rous sarcoma virus contain v-Src isoforms with C-terminal truncations (1.Stehelin D. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. Vogt P.K. Nature. 1976; 260: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar) and activating mutations within the kinase or SH3 domains (2.Schwartz D.E. Tizard R. Gilbert W. Cell. 1983; 32: 853-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 3.Lerner T.L. Hanafusa H. J. Virol. 1984; 49: 549-556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, v-Src SH3 domain substitutions (Trp at Arg-95 and Ile at Thr-96) introduced into normal c-Src, converted c-Src into a transforming protein (4.Kato J.-Y. Takeya T. Grandori C. Iba H. Levy J.B. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4155-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Crystal structure analyses revealed that the v-Src SH3 domain mutations were within the RT loop and were near the surface ligand binding groove (5.Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Substitution of murine c-Src RT loop residues (Trp at Arg-97 and Ile at Thr-98) did not disrupt the binding of normal c-Src SH3 targets such as p130Cas (6.Hauck C.R. Hunter T. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17653-17662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Instead, RT loop residue changes at Trp-97 promoted the binding of proteins such as connexin 43 and FAK to the c-Src SH3 domain (6.Hauck C.R. Hunter T. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17653-17662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 7.Kanemitsu M.Y. Loo L.W. Simon S. Lau A.F. Eckhart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22824-22831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In FAK, the v-Src SH3 domain binding sites were mapped to three proline-rich motifs conforming to a P XXP XXφ consensus where φ is a hydrophobic residue (6.Hauck C.R. Hunter T. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17653-17662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This extended P XXP XXφ motif differs from c-Src class I or class II SH3 binding motifs (5.Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar) and is conserved in other v-Src SH3 domain-binding proteins (7.Kanemitsu M.Y. Loo L.W. Simon S. Lau A.F. Eckhart W. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 13: 5225-5232Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Since the v-Src SH3 domain binds to additional targets compared with the c-Src SH3 domain, the RT loop substitutions can be considered gain-of-function mutations. FAK is a non-receptor PTK that associates with transmembrane integrins to promote matrix-initiated signaling. In normal cells, a transient c-Src·FAK PTK signaling complex is formed by c-Src SH2 binding to FAK in an integrin-stimulated manner (9.Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar, 10.Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). This PTK complex is linked to increased cell motility, cell cycle progression, and cell survival signals (for reviews, see Refs. 11.Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 12.Parsons J.T. Martin K.H. Slack J.K. Taylor J.M. Weed S.A.

Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2000; 25: 37-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). FAK was first identified as a v-Src substrate (15.Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar), and combined v-Src SH2 and SH3 binding to FAK stabilizes an integrin-independent signaling complex (6.Hauck C.R. Hunter T.

Within this complex, v-Src promotes elevated FAK kinase activity, the SH2-mediated binding of Grb2 to phosphorylated FAK Tyr-925, and the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK-associated proteins such as p130Cas and paxillin (9.Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). Although p130Cas-null cells are refractory to transformation by activated Src (17.Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Ishikawa T. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), the role of the FAK in a v-Src signaling complex remains undefined. Here we show that a v-Src SH3 domain-stabilized signaling complex with FAK is localized to β1 integrin-containing invadopodia and promotes cell invasion. Large T immortalized Src−/− fibroblasts were maintained as described (10.Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was used to change the codon for Trp-95 to Arg-95 within v-Src Prague C to create v-Src-RT and this construct was subcloned into pRetroOff (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). 293 Phoenix-Eco packaging cells (G. Nolan, Stanford) were transfected, and the retrovirus-containing media was collected after 72 h. Src−/− cells were infected for 24 h and selected for growth in 3 μg/ml puromycin. Pooled populations of cells were used in all assays. Anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(p), 4G10) monoclonal antibody (mAb), avian-specific mAb to v-Src (EC10), and anti-paxillin mAb were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag mAb (16B12) was from Covance Research (Berkeley, CA). Anti-c-Src mAb (2–17), anti-HA epitope tag mAb (12CA5), and affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to the N- and C-terminal domains of FAK were used (18.Sieg D.J. Ilic D. Jones K.C. Damsky C.H.

Polyclonal phosphospecific antibodies to FAK (Tyr(p)-397, Tyr(p)-861, and Tyr(p)-925) were from BIOSOURCE International (Hopkinton, MA). Immunoprecipitations (IPs), blotting, and sequential polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) reprobing were performed as described (18.Sieg D.J. Ilic D. Jones K.C. Damsky C.H.

Ordinary one-way analysis of variance the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons t test were used to determine significance. For haptotaxis assays, the membrane underside of Millicell (12-mm diameter with 8-μm pores) chambers (Millipore) was coated with 10 μg/ml FN (Sigma). For invasion assays, diluted (30 μg in 100 μl of H2O) growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD PharMingen) was used as described (19.Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Hsia D.A. Loftus J.C. Gaarde W.A. Monia B.P. Schlaepfer D.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7079-7090PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were performed on immunoisolated proteins at 32 °C for 15 min as described (19.Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Hsia D.A. Loftus J.C. Gaarde W.A. Monia B.P. Schlaepfer D.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7079-7090PubMed Google Scholar). Cells plated onto FN-coated slides in the presence of serum for 2 h were incubated with a mixture of 5 μg/ml anti-β1 integrin 9EG7 rat mAb (BD PharMingen) and 280 μg/ml ChromPure donkey IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 1 h; fixed in 3.8% paraformaldehyde, PBS; and permeabilized in cold acetone. Slides were blocked (Vector Laboratories, San Francisco, CA) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml mouse anti-v-Src (EC10) 4 μg/ml rabbit anti-FAK and 140 μg/ml donkey IgG. After washing in PBS, slides were incubated (40 min) with FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse, TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-rat, and biotinylated anti-rabbit. Cells were washed in PBS, incubated (15 min) with 1 μg/ml AMCA-avidin D conjugate (Vector Laboratories), washed in PBS, mounted, and visualized using a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope. Staining of invadopodia on the Millicell membrane lower surface was performed as described previously (20.Ilic D. Genbacev O. Jin F. Caceres E. Almeida E.A.C. Bellingard-Dubouchaud V. Schaefer E.M. Damsky C.H. Fisher S.J. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 93-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase- (LacZ) and FRNK-expressing adenoviruses were used as described (19.Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Hsia D.A. Loftus J.C. Gaarde W.A. Monia B.P. Schlaepfer D.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7079-7090PubMed Google Scholar). HA-tagged murine FAK was subcloned into pShuttle-CMV to prepare recombinant E1-deleted adenovirus (Stratagene). Src−/− cells were infected at a matched multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) between 30 and 100 plaque-forming units/cell and analyzed after 2 days. To test the biological significance of gain-of-function v-Src SH3 binding interactions, comparisons were made between Src−/− fibroblasts stably reconstituted with murine c-Src, Prague C v-Src with a Trp-95-containing SH3 domain, and Prague C v-Src-RT with a normal c-Src-like Arg-95-containing SH3 domain (Fig. 1A). Pooled Src−/− cell populations equally expressed either c-Src, v-Src, or v-Src-RT (Fig. 1A). Analyses of Src-associated IVK activity from serum-starved cells revealed that both v-Src and v-Src-RT possessed higher activity compared with normal c-Src (Fig. 1B). Cell proliferation analyses were performed. When plated onto FN in 0.5% serum, Src−/− cells did not proliferate and c-Src-reconstituted cells underwent one round of cell division within 6 days, whereas v-Src and v-Src-RT readily proliferated and formed foci after 6 days (Fig. 1C). Src−/− and c-Src-reconstituted cells showed increased growth in 10% serum-containing media (Fig. 1D). However, v-Src- and v-Src-RT-expressing cells exhibited a similar growth rate in 10% serum that was not significantly different (p > 0.05) from cell proliferation in 0.5% serum (Fig. 1, C and D). Comparisons between v-Src- and v-Src-RT-reconstituted Src−/− cells revealed no significant growth differences (p > 0.1). Further, both v-Src and v-Src-RT promoted the anchorage-independent growth of Src−/− cells in soft agar (Fig. 1E). No differences in either the size or number of soft agar colonies were observed (data not shown). Together these results show that v-Src and v-Src-RT promote equivalent serum- and anchorage-independent Src−/− cell growth. Since Src−/− cells exhibit integrin-stimulated cell spreading and motility defects (21.Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), FN haptotaxis motility assays were performed with the reconstituted Src−/− cells. Normal c-Src expression enhanced cell motility 3-fold compared with Src−/− cells (Fig. 2A). Both v-Src and v-Src-RT equally enhanced FN-stimulated Src−/− cell motility but at levels less than c-Src (Fig. 1D). This lower level of v-Src-stimulated haptotaxis is consistent with studies showing that v-Src phosphorylation of integrins inhibited in vitro cell migration compared with normal cells (22.Sakai T. Jove R. Fassler R. Mosher D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3808-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Since a fully transformed cell phenotype encompasses changes in the growth, motility, and invasive property of cells, the reconstituted Src−/− cells were analyzed for the acquisition of an invasive phenotype. c-Src-reconstituted cells did not penetrate through a Matrigel basement membrane barrier (Fig. 2B). Src−/− cells transformed by v-Src but not v-Src-RT possessed invasive activity in 24-h assays (Fig. 2B). Although v-Src-RT was able to penetrate the Matrigel barrier at low numbers after 48 h (data not shown), our results support the conclusion that gain-of-function v-Src SH3 domain binding interactions promote enhanced cell invasion activity that is independent of changes in cell growth. To determine whether the stability of the v-Src·FAK signaling complex was altered in v-Src-RT-expressing cells, FAK IP analyses were performed (Fig. 2C). In lysates from suspended cells, FAK exhibited high phosphorylation levels and strong association with v-Src compared with reduced autophosphorylation and weak association with v-Src-RT, respectively (Fig. 2C). To analyze whether the Arg-95 reversion mutation in v-Src-RT was associated with reduced FAK phosphorylation in adherent cells, FAK IPs were analyzed with phosphospecific FAK antibodies (Fig. 2D). Consistent with previous studies (10.Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-397 is reduced in Src−/− cells, and this is rescued by c-Src re-expression (Fig. 2D). v-Src promoted increased FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-861 and Tyr-925 but not at FAK Tyr-397 compared with c-Src-expressing cells. FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-861 and Tyr-925 were reduced in v-Src-RT- compared with v-Src-transformed Src−/− cells (Fig. 2D), and these results are consistent with the reduced association of v-Src-RT with FAK (Fig. 2C). To evaluate whether differences in v-Src-stimulated cell invasion and FAK phosphorylation were associated with either altered cell morphology or v-Src-RT localization, Src−/− cells expressing v-Src or v-Src-RT were triple stained for v-Src, FAK, and β1 integrin (Fig. 3). When plated onto FN-coated slides, v-Src-expressing cells formed fine cell extensions that were enriched with v-Src (Fig. 3A,arrowheads). Staining for FAK revealed a co-localization with v-Src at cell extensions (Fig. 3B) and with v-Src in ventral focal contact sites (data not shown). v-Src-RT-expressing cells formed reduced numbers of long cell extensions and instead formed short pointed projections around the cell periphery (Fig. 3A). v-Src-RT and FAK co-localized at pointed cell projections (Fig. 3B); however, v-Src-RT also exhibited strong perinuclear staining that was not detected in v-Src-expressing cells (Fig. 3A). When plated onto FN, c-Src-reconstituted Src−/− cells exhibited a morphology similar to v-Src-RT cells, and c-Src had a cellular distribution similar to v-Src-RT (data not shown). Previous studies have shown that Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chicken fibroblasts and human melanoma cells form β1integrin-enriched peripheral and ventral cell extensions termed invadopodia (23.Mueller S.C. Chen W.T. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 213-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Nakahara H. Mueller S.C. Nomizu M. Yamada Y. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Strong co-localization of β1integrin with v-Src at both perimeter and ventral invadopodia sites were observed in v-Src-transformed Src−/− cells (Fig. 3C). β1 integrin staining of v-Src-RT cells showed a strong perimeter distribution with minimal staining in the central or ventral region of cells (Fig. 3C). v-Src-RT was co-localized with β1 integrin only in a subset of cell perimeter pointed projections. Whereas SH3 domain integrity is important for targeting both c-Src and v-Src to focal contact sites (25.Kaplan K.B. Bibbins K.B. Swedlow J.R. Arnaud M. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4745-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 26.Fincham V.J. Brunton V.G. Frame M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6518-6536Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), our studies suggest that specific gain-of-function v-Src SH3 interactions with targets such as FAK may enhance the formation of invadopodia. To assess the importance of FAK in v-Src-stimulated cell invasion and invadopodia formation, recombinant adenovirus infection was used to overexpress HA epitope-tagged FAK in either Src−/− or v-Src-RT-transformed cells (Fig. 4). Use of a recombinant adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase (LacZ) showed >90% infectivity of v-Src- and v-Src-RT-transformed Src−/− cells (Fig. 4A). FAK overexpression in Src−/− cells did not promote Matrigel invasion, whereas equivalent FAK overexpression in v-Src-RT-transformed Src−/− cells promoted a 9-fold increase in Matrigel invasion (Fig. 4,B and C). This level of FAK-enhanced v-Src-RT cell invasion exceeded that of v-Src-transformed Src−/− cells (Fig. 4C). When expressed in v-Src-RT cells, HA-FAK was phosphorylated at Tyr-397, Tyr-861, and Tyr-925 as opposed to being weakly phosphorylated only at Tyr-397 when expressed in Src−/− cells (data not shown). To determine the mechanism of increased HA-FAK phosphorylation, v-Src-RT-associated in vitro kinase assays were performed (Fig. 4D). Compared with noninfected cells, HA-FAK overexpression facilitated the formation of an active signaling complex with v-Src-RT and also promoted the co-immunoprecipitation of the integrin-associated protein paxillin with v-Src-RT (Fig. 4D). Since FAK overexpression promoted increased v-Src-RT but not control Src−/− cell invasion through Matrigel, indirect immunofluorescence staining of Millicell membranes was used to evaluate whether FAK functioned to recruit v-Src-RT to invadopodia during Matrigel invasion (Fig. 5). In the absence of FAK overexpression, no v-Src-RT cell protrusions were present at 12 h, and after 18 h, partial co-localization of v-Src and endogenous FAK were detected at the low numbers of emerging invadopodia (Fig. 5). In v-Src-RT cells infected with HA-FAK adenovirus, strong co-localization of v-Src-RT and HA-FAK were detected in invadopodia projections at 12 h (Fig. 5). After 18 h, the adenovirus-infected v-Src-RT cells had fully emerged from the Millicell pores, and at this point, v-Src-RT and HA-FAK were not significantly co-localized. These results suggest that FAK activation and connections to integrins potentially through the binding of integrin-associated proteins such as paxillin (Fig. 4D) are important in stabilizing the localization of a v-Src-RT signaling complex targeted to invadopodia. To support the importance of FAK in mediating v-Src-stimulated cell invasion, the FAK C-terminal domain termed FRNK, which functions as a specific inhibitor of FAK activity (11.Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 12.Parsons J.T. Martin K.H. Slack J.K. Taylor J.M. Weed S.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5606-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 13.Schaller M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1540: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), was expressed in v-Src-transformed Src−/− cells by recombinant adenovirus infection (Fig. 4, B and C). FRNK potently blocked v-Src-stimulated cell invasion (Fig. 4B), and FRNK inhibited v-Src-stimulated endogenous FAK tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). In summary, our results show that the introduction of a gain-of-function v-Src SH3 domain point mutation results in the activation of an invasion-promoting signaling pathway in Src−/− cells. This cell invasion activity was independent of changes in either v-Src-stimulated haptotaxis motility or v-Src-stimulated cell growth in low serum and soft agar. Instead this cell invasion activity was connected to the SH3-mediated stabilization of a v-Src·FAK signaling complex, increased FAK tyrosine phosphorylation, and the co-localization of v-Src with FAK and β1 integrin at invadopodia cell projections. Our results support the hypothesis that FAK acts to promote invadopodia formation and to increase cell invasion through the recruitment of v-Src into an activated signaling complex. Since FAK functions to promote normal cytotrophoblast-mediated invasion of the uterus during placental formation (20.Ilic D. Genbacev O. Jin F. Caceres E. Almeida E.A.C. Bellingard-Dubouchaud V.

This requires that the gas in the nebular region where these grains condensed was 16O-rich. This contrasts with an 16O-poor gas present during the formation of chondrules, suggesting that CAIs and AOAs formed in a spatially restricted region of the solar nebula containing 16O-rich gas. The 16O-rich gas composition may have resulted either from mass-independent isotopic chemistry or from evaporation of regions with enhanced dust/gas ratios, possibly in an X-wind environment near the young Sun."

Gene disruption studies demonstrate that RALDH2 is essential for catalyzing the second step of RA synthesis during development as Raldh2−/− embryos die at mid-gestation and almost totally lack RA (11.Niederreither K.

Several enzymes capable of catalyzing the first step of RA synthesis, oxidation of retinol to retinal, have been identified within the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) families (1.Duester G.

RDH5 functions in vivo as an 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase to generate the visual pigment 11-cis-retinal (25.Yamamoto H. Simon A. Eriksson U. Harris E. Berson E. Dryja T.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 26.Driessen C.A.G.G. Winkens H.J. Hoffmann K. Kuhlmann L.D. Janssen B.P.M. Van Vugt A.H.M. Van Hooser J.P. Wieringa B.E.

Thus, microsomal oxidation of retinol to retinal by SDRs may have functions distinct from RA synthesis such as the one revealed for vision, whereas cytosolic oxidation of retinol to retinal by ADH or aldo-keto reductase may contribute to RA synthesis by cytosolic RALDHs. Gene disruption studies have also provided evidence of a physiological function for ADH in RA production. Adh4−/−mice are viable but suffer increased postnatal lethality during gestational vitamin A deficiency (VAD) compared with wild-type mice (27.Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. Dev. Genet. 1999; 25: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, ADH4 can be considered essential for RA production to ensure postnatal survival during VAD, a condition commonly encountered by animals in natural environments. Studies onAdh3−/− mice have shown that ADH3 also minimizes the effect of gestational VAD but is also needed to maintain growth on a standard diet (20.Molotkov, A., Fan, X., Deltour, L., Foglio, M. H., Martras, S., Farrés, J., Parés, X., and Duester, G. (2002)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in pressGoogle Scholar). In addition,Adh1−/− mice are viable and behave no worse than wild-type mice during gestational VAD (20.Molotkov, A., Fan, X., Deltour, L., Foglio, M. H., Martras, S., Farrés, J., Parés, X., and Duester, G. (2002)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16796-16801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas ADH3- and ADH4-catalyzed RA production is necessary for supplying the ligand for nuclear receptors to fulfill the function of vitamin A in development, it is possible that ADH1-catalyzed RA synthesis functions in another fashion, perhaps the oxidative elimination of excess retinol to prevent vitamin A toxicity. That excess vitamin A is toxic has been well established (29.Kamm J.J. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1982; 6: 652-659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 30.Biesalski H.K. Toxicology. 1989; 57: 117-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 31.Armstrong R.B. Ashenfelter K.O. Eckhoff C. Levin A.A. Shapiro S.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 545-572Google Scholar) and has resulted in the recommendation that consumption of vitamin A-rich foods or vitamin A supplements be limited, particularly during pregnancy as fetal development is most sensitive (32.Nelson M. Br. Med. J. 1990; 301: 1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The main oxidative pathway for retinol turnover is the oxidation of retinol to retinal and then oxidation of retinal to RA followed by glucuronide conjugation of the acid and/or 4-hydroxylation of RA (3.Frolik C.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. 2. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1984: 177-208Crossref Google Scholar). The enzyme responsible for oxidizing excess retinol to retinal to initiate this catabolic pathway has not been identified. To examine the physiological roles of ADH1 and ADH4 in retinoid metabolism we report here the generation of an Adh1/4 double null mutant mouse line and its comparison to single null mutants when challenged by vitamin A deficiency or toxicity. These genetic findings demonstrate that ADH1 and ADH4 have evolved to perform largely non-overlapping roles in retinoid metabolism, ADH1 in minimizing vitamin A toxicity and ADH4 in survival during VAD. A gene replacement targeting vector for Adh1 carrying a hygromycin-positive selection marker (PGK-hygro) was produced by alteration of an Adh1 targeting vector containing a neomycin-positive selection marker (PGK-neo) as well as a thymidine kinase-negative selection marker (PGK-TK) as previously described (28.Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16796-16801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A portion of the neomycin resistance gene was removed from this vector withBamHI and XhoI and replaced with a 2.2-kbBamHI-XhoI fragment containing the hygromycin resistance gene controlled by the PGK promoter (33.Mortensen R.M. Zubiaur M. Neer E.J. Seidman J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. . 1991; 88: 7036-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this vector, exons 7–9 plus the polyadenylation signal of Adh1are replaced by PGK-hygro. TheAdh1-hygro gene targeting vector described above was linearized with NotI and introduced by electroporation using standard methodology (34.Joyner A.L. Gene Targeting: a Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993Google Scholar) into Adh4+/− mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells that were previously targeted forAdh4 with a neomycin resistance marker (27.Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. Dev. Genet. 1999; 25: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To enrich for Adh4+/− ES cells incorporating theAdh1-hygro construct by homologous recombination, positive selection was with 125 μg/ml hygromycin B and negative selection was with 2 μm gancyclovir. Identification ofAdh4+/− ES cells carrying also a deletion inAdh1 was accomplished by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA isolated from ∼200 surviving cell clones (35.Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor1994Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was digested with HindIII, and an external DNA probe for Southern blot analysis consisted of a 0.2-kbEcoRV-HindIII fragment from the 3′-flanking region of Adh1 (36.Zhang K. Bosron W.F. Edenberg H.J. Gene. 1987; 57: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutantAdh1 alleles were identified by 2.8- and 5.7-kbHindIII fragments, respectively. As it was desired to obtain an ES cell clone in which the Adh1 targeting event had occurred on the same copy of chromosome 3 already targeted forAdh4 as opposed to the wild-type chromosome 3, several independently isolated double-targeted clones were isolated. Several Adh1+/−Adh4+/−double heterozygous ES cell clones were subjected to karyotype analysis to identify those having a normal karyotype for blastocyst injection.Adh1+/−Adh4+/− ES cell clones (clones 9 and 64) were microinjected into C57Bl/6 blastocysts, which were then implanted into pseudopregnant females resulting in chimeric mice identified by partial agouti coat color (34.Joyner A.L. Gene Targeting: a Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993Google Scholar). Male chimeric mice derived from each ES cell line were mated to wild-type female Black Swiss mice, and germ line transmission was identified by agouti coat color. Agouti offspring were subjected to Southern blot analysis of tail DNA (35.Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor1994Google Scholar) to identifyAdh1+/−Adh4+/−individuals heterozygous for mutations in both Adh1 andAdh4 using the probe described above for Adh1 as well as an Adh4 probe described previously in which the wild-type and mutant Adh4 alleles are identified by 4.0-kb and 5.8-kb HindIII fragments, respectively (27.Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. Dev. Genet. 1999; 25: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Mice derived from ES cell clone 9 were found to possess mutations in bothAdh1 and Adh4 and hence carry a copy of chromosome 3 in which both genes are mutated. HeterozygousAdh1+/− Adh4+/−matings were performed to produce homozygousAdh1−/− Adh4−/− mice and wild-type mice identified by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA.Adh1−/−Adh4−/− mice (referred to as Adh1/4 null mutant mice orAdh1/4−/− mice) and wild-type mice were then expanded to form permanent mouse lines maintained under standard laboratory conditions. Other mice used in this study are the originalAdh1−/− and Adh4−/−null mutant lines previously described (27.Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. Dev. Genet. 1999; 25: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28.Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16796-16801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) both of which have the same genetic background as the Adh1/4 and wild-type mice described here. For verification of a null mutant phenotype, polyclonal antibodies against mouse ADH1 and ADH4 were used to probe Western blots of mouse liver and stomach using 20 μg of total protein per lane as reported (37.Haselbeck R.J. Duester G. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1997; 21: 1484-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Gestational VAD was induced by a modification of previous methods (27.Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. Dev. Genet. 1999; 25: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For each mouse strain, original parental mice (three mating pairs each) were placed on Purina VAD diet 5822 (vitamin A <0.22 IU/g) at the beginning of mating, and resulting offspring were maintained on this diet. Congenitally VAD F1generation females were mated at 6-weeks-old (to males maintained on standard mouse chow to remain fertile), thus producing congenitally VAD F2 generation offspring. For both rounds of matings, females were separated from males before birth to ensure that they did not again become pregnant during postnatal development of their offspring. Blood was collected and serum all-trans-retinol was quantitated by HPLC analysis as indicated below. For analysis of retinoic acid production following a single acute retinol dose, retinol was administered essentially as described (38.Collins M.D. Eckhoff C. Chahoud I. Bochert G. Nau H. Arch. Toxicol. 1992; 66: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). All-trans-retinol (Sigma) was dissolved in acetone-Tween 20-water (0.25:5:4.75 v/v/v) and was administered at a dose of 50 mg/kg by oral injection to female mice (age- and weight-matched). After 2 h, liver and blood were collected and stored at −20 °C until HPLC analysis as described below. For determination of the retinol lethal dose, mice were given a single oral dose of retinol as previously reported (29.Kamm J.J. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1982; 6: 652-659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Male 14-week-old mice were used for all strains examined. All-trans-retinol (Sigma) was dissolved in corn oil and administered by oral intubation at 0.2 ml/10 g of body weight. Doses ranged from 0.5 to 3.5 g/kg. Lethality was monitored daily during 14 days after retinol administration. A dose resulting in the death of 50% of the mice (LD50) by day 14, plus the 95% confidence limits for the LD50 dose, were calculated using the methods of Litchfield and Wilcoxon (39.Litchfield Jr., J.T. Wilcoxon F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1949; 96: 99-117PubMed Google Scholar). Liver (250 mg) was homogenized on ice in 2 ml of methanol-acetone (50:50 v/v), whereas serum (200 μl) was extracted with 2 ml of methanol-acetone (50:50 v/v). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the organic phase was evaporated under vacuum, and the residue was dissolved in 200 μl of methanol-dimethyl sulfoxide (50:50 v/v). Samples were analyzed by HPLC to quantitate retinoid levels using standards for all-trans-RA and all-trans-retinol (Sigma). Reversed-phase HPLC analysis was performed using a Microsorb-MVTM 100 C18 column (4.5 × 250 mm) (Varian) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Mobile phase consisted of 0.5 m ammonium acetate-methanol-acetonitrile (25:65:10 v/v) (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B). The A:B (v/v) gradient composition was 100:0 at the time of injection, 70:30 at 1 min, 65:35 at 14 min, and 0:100 at 16 min. UV detection was carried out at 340 nm. Statistical significance was determined for raw data with Statistica version 5.0 software using the unpaired Student's t test (two-tailed). Mice were propagated on either Purina 5015 standard mouse chow, which contains the standard amount of vitamin A (30 IU/g) or Purina 5755 basal diet supplemented with additional retinyl acetate to bring the total vitamin A concentration to 300 IU/g all in the form of retinyl acetate, which is quickly hydrolyzed to retinol in the digestive tract. Two groups of adult female mice, which had been placed on one or the other of these diets for 2 weeks, were mated with males while being maintained on their respective diets to generate offspring, which were also maintained, respectively, on the same diet after weaning. Mice carrying single null mutants for either Adh1 orAdh4 have been previously described (27.Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. Dev. Genet. 1999; 25: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28.Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16796-16801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Analysis of the mouse Adh gene complex (15.Szalai G. Duester G. Friedman R. Jia H. Lin S. Roe B.A. Felder M.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) has shown thatAdh1 and Adh4 are closely linked on mouse chromosome 3 along with four other functional Adh genes and a pseudogene (Fig. 1B). Thus, a double null mutant would not be able to be obtained by simple matings of the two single mutants unless a rare crossing-over event occurred between the two mutant genes on homologous chromosomes to produce a single copy of chromosome 3 carrying both mutations. Instead, double null mutants were obtained by sequential gene targeting of ES cells starting with Adh4+/− ES cells, i.e.the cell line used to generate Adh4−/− mice targeted with an Adh4-neo vector providing G418 selection (27.Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. Dev. Genet. 1999; 25: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As Adh4+/− ES cells already possess G418 resistance, they were electroporated with an Adh1-hygro gene targeting vector that carries the hygromycin selectable marker (Fig. 1A). Incorporation of this vector deletes exons 7–9 plus the polyadenylation site, thus producing the same type of mutation previously reported for Adh1−/− mice that were targeted with an Adh1-neo vector (28.Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16796-16801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As this gene targeting event could occur either on the copy of chromosome 3 containing the null mutant allele of Adh4 (which was desired) or on the other copy containing the wild-type allele ofAdh4 (not desired), this was sorted out when targeted ES cells were introduced into mice and screened by Southern blot analysis for mutations in both Adh1 and Adh4 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” One ES cell line (clone 9) produced the desired result, thus generatingAdh1+/− Adh4+/−(Adh1/4+/−) double heterozygous mice in which the two mutant alleles segregated essentially as a single trait. Mating of Adh1/4+/− mice resulted in the production of Adh1/4−/− double homozygous mice that were viable and that were generated at the normal Mendelian ratio (10 litters from double heterozygous parents resulted in −/−, 26%,n = 21; −/+, 46%, n = 36; +/+, 28%,n = 22). This is similar to the results reported for each single mutant (27.Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. Dev. Genet. 1999; 25: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28.Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16796-16801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Also, Adh1/4−/−mice were fertile and a homozygous line was established. Western blot analysis verified that Adh1/4−/− mice lacked both ADH1 and ADH4 proteins (data not shown). To determine whether the loss of ADH1 or ADH4 or both enzymes negatively impacts viability and growth when maintained under normal laboratory conditions, we examined the generation, survival, and growth of each of the mouse strains on standard mouse chow.Adh1−/−, Adh4−/−, andAdh1/4−/− mice showed no significant difference with wild-type (WT) with respect to reproductive ability, survival, or body weight at maturity (Table I). As Adh1/4−/−mice were able to reproduce and develop similar toAdh1−/− andAdh4−/−single mutants, this indicates that a third retinol-metabolizing enzyme must exist for production of RA needed during development.Table ISurvival and growth of mice lacking ADH1 or ADH4 or bothGenotypeLittersPups bornPups/litterPostnatal mortality% Survival/no.Weight at 14 weeksgWild-type171448.47 ± 0.47199.3 (143)M 34.3 ± 1.2F 26.3 ± 0.7Adh1−/−171518.88 ± 0.49795.4 (144)M 34.4 ± 3.2F 27.8 ± 1.1Adh4−/−171669.76 ± 0.63398.2 (163)M 38.2 ± 3.4F 26.2 ± 1.1Adh1/4−/−171418.31 ± 0.50695.7 (136)M 35.1 ± 2.6F 27.3 ± 2.2% survival refers to mice alive at weaning.

For determination of body weight at 14-weeks-old: M (male), n = 14; F (female),n = 7; values are mean ± S.E. We previously reported that Adh4−/− mice exposed to gestational VAD suffer increased postnatal lethality compared with WT mice (27.Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. Dev. Genet. 1999; 25: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here we compared Adh4−/− and WT mice with Adh1−/− andAdh1/4−/− mice for survival and growth during gestational VAD. Mice were mated for two generations on a VAD diet in order to induce severe deficiency in the F2generation during development. As expected from previous studies (27.Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. Dev. Genet. 1999; 25: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar),Adh4−/− F2 generation mice were severely effected by VAD, displaying 100% lethality by postnatal day 15 (P15) (Fig. 2, A andB). In contrast, WT and Adh1−/−mice both exhibited ∼60% survival at P40.Adh1/4−/− mice did not perform worse thanAdh4−/− mice, but instead survived a little longer, with 100% lethality by P24 (Fig. 2, A andB) Adh4−/− and Adh1/4−/−VAD mice exhibited severe growth deficiency in the F2generation compared with WT and Adh1−/− mice. Whereas WT and Adh1−/− mice had comparable body weights from birth to P40 and achieved weights of 16–18 g, growth of Adh4−/− mice began to deviate downward from WT at P4, and body weights beyond 3 g were not achieved before death; growth of Adh1/4−/− mice began to deviate downward from WT at P8, and body weights beyond 6 g were not achieved before death (Fig. 2C) Measurement of serum retinol in the female mice used to generate the VAD F2 generation offspring verified that each mouse strain had become essentially equally deficient (Fig. 3). Values for serum all-trans-retinol in control females maintained on standard mouse chow ranged from 0.3–0.4 μg/ml among the strains, and this fell to 0.1–0.17 μg/ml for the original female parents maintained on the VAD diet for 8 weeks and fell further to ∼0.03 μg/ml for each strain of congenitally VAD F1 generation females that served as parents for the F2 generation described above. Thus, the completely penetrant postnatal lethality observed inAdh4−/− and Adh1/4−/−mice subjected to VAD was not due to significant differences in the level of serum all-trans-retinol in these strains relative to WT and Adh1−/− mice. As Adh1−/− mice and WT had similar survival and growth during VAD, there is no evidence that ADH1 provides protection against VAD. Also, there is no additive effect on VAD when both ADH1 and ADH4 are missing. Instead, these experiments show that when mice lacking both ADH1 and ADH4 are exposed to VAD, they will survive longer and experience more growth than mice lacking only ADH4. This interesting relationship between ADH1 and ADH4 is discussed further below. To examine oxidative turnover of retinol, mice were treated ora"

We find that onconase enters living mammalian cells and selectively cleaves tRNA with no detectable degradation of rRNA. The RNA specificity of onconase in vitro using reticulocyte lysate and purified RNA substrates indicates that proteins associated with rRNA protect the rRNA from the onconase ribonucleolytic action contributing to the cellular tRNA selectivity of onconase. The onconase-mediated tRNA degradation in cells appears to be accompanied by increased levels of tRNA turnover and induction of tRNA synthesis perhaps in response to the selective toxin-induced loss of tRNA. Degradation products of tRNA3Lys, which acts as a primer for HIV-1 replication, were clearly detected in cells infected with HIV-1 and treated with sublethal concentrations of onconase. However, a new synthesis of tRNA3Lys also seemed to occur in these cells resulting in plateauing of the steady-state levels of this tRNA. We conclude that the degradation of tRNAs may be a primary factor in the cytotoxic activity of onconase.

Onconase is a ribonuclease found in eggs and early embryos of the leopard frog, Rana pipiens(1.Ardelt W. Mikulski S.M. Shogen K. J. Biol.

Carter S.P. Mikulski S.M. Ardelt W.J. Shogen K. Cell Tissue Kinet. 1988; 21: 169-182PubMed Google Scholar) unlike homologous mammalian members of the RNase A family. The protein expresses RNase activity that appears essential for its biological activities and is insensitive to inhibition by the ribonuclease inhibitor (1.Ardelt W. Mikulski S.M. Shogen K. J. Biol.

Mikulski S.M. Shogen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to mammalian RNase A family members including bovine pancreatic RNase, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, and angiogenin (7.Youle R.J. Newton D. Wu Y.N. Gadina M. Rybak S.M. Crit. Rev. Ther.

Onconase at concentrations nontoxic to H9 cells has been found to specifically inhibit HIV-1 replication in HIV-1-infected human H9 leukemia cells without necessarily killing the virus-infected cell (12.Youle R.J.

An examination of the mechanism of this inhibition reveals that onconase enters the infected cells and degrades HIV-1 RNA without degrading ribosomal RNA or the three different cellular messenger RNAs analyzed. The primary molecular substrates and molecular mechanism of RNA selectivity for onconase anticancer and antiviral activity remain unclear. Here we describe the mechanism of a very specific elimination of tRNA and activation of tRNA synthesis by onconase in cells. Onconase was prepared at Alfacell Corporation from R. pipiens oocytes by a modification of the previously published method (1.Ardelt W. Mikulski S.M. Shogen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme was first isolated from the cell extract on SP-Sepharose and then further purified by re-chromatography on the same exchanger followed by the size-exclusion on Sephacryl S-100 in 75 mm ammonium bicarbonate and lyophilized. The final preparation was homogenous on SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate (nuclease-treated) was from Promega. All-trans-retinoic acid was purchased from Calbiochem. CD4-positive H9 lymphocyte cells uninfected and persistently infected with HIV-1 IIIB strain were obtained from Dr. Robert Gallo (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). PurifiedEscherichia coli 23 S and 16 S ribosomal RNA and 5 S ribosomal RNA were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Purified tRNAPhe and 0.1–1.0-kb RNA marker were purchased from Sigma. Three DNA oligonucleotide probes for detecting the tRNA3Lys, tRNA1,2Lys (14.Jiang M. Mak J. Ladha A. Cohen E. Klein M. Rovinski B. Kleiman L. J.

Each probe was 18-nucleotides long and complementary to the last 18 nucleotides at the 3′ end of their respective tRNA. The probe oligonucleotide sequences were 5′-TGGCGCCCGAACAGGGAC-3′ (for tRNA3Lys), 5′- TGGCGCCCAACGTGGGGC-3′ (for tRNA1,2Lys), and 5′-TGGTGCCGAAACCCGGGA-3′ (for tRNAPhe). H9 lymphocyte cells uninfected or persistently infected with HIV-1 were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamycin (12.Youle R.J. Wu Y.-N.

After 20-h incubation, cells were processed to isolate total cellular RNA. Persistently infected H9 cells were washed extensively to reduce levels of free virus and resuspended at 2 × 105 cells/ml for further use. Onconase at 5 × 10−8m was added to washed cells, and cultures were sampled daily over a 4-day period. At the end of each incubation, cells were harvested by centrifuging the culture at 400 × g for 10 min. Cell pellets were processed to isolate total cellular RNA. Total RNA was analyzed on 1.4% agarose gel and 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 7.5 m urea. 9L rat glioma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 10 μg/ml gentamycin (4.Wu Y.N. Saxena S.K. Ardelt W. Gadina M. Mikulski S.M. Lorenzo C.D. D'Alessio G. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17476-17481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Retinoic acid stock solution (15 mm in Me2SO) was diluted into leucine-free RPMI 1640 medium without fetal calf serum to 10 μm. The same dilution of Me2SO was added in the control solutions. After removing the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, cells were incubated in the above leucine-free RPMI 1640 medium containing increasing concentrations of onconase with or without retinoic acid for 20 h followed by isolation of total cellular RNA. Total RNA was analyzed on 1.4% agarose gel and 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 7.5 m urea. RNA specificity of onconase was also tested in rabbit reticulocyte lysate using phosphate-buffered saline as a reaction buffer. The reaction mixture (50 μl) containing rabbit reticulocyte lysate and onconase at 1 × 10−9 to 1 × 10−7m concentrations were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. At the end of the incubation, the total RNA was isolated from the reaction mixture using RNAzol™, and the RNA pellet was dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA. Approximately 1.5 μg of total RNA was analyzed in either 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 7.5m urea or 1.4% agarose gel. The RNA was visualized after staining the gel with ethidium bromide. In the experiment shown in Fig. 3, purified E. coli rRNA was added to the lysate, and the onconase action was studied. The reaction mixture (50 μl) containing purified RNA from rabbit reticulocyte lysate and onconase at 1 × 10−9 to 1 × 10−7mconcentrations were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C in phosphate-buffered saline as reaction buffer. At the end of the incubation, the total RNA from the reaction mixture was isolated using RNAzol. The RNA pellet was dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA. Approximately 1.5 μg of total RNA was analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 7.5m urea. Total RNA from H9 and 9L cells and rabbit reticulocyte lysate was extracted using RNAzol, according to the protocol supplied by Tel-Test Inc. (Friendswood, TX). Cells were homogenized in RNAzol (2 ml RNAzol/1 × 107 cells). RNA was then extracted with 0.1 volume of chloroform, precipitated with 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol, and finally washed with 75% ethanol. The RNA pellet was dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA. Electrophoresis of RNA samples was carried out in 1.4% agarose gel using a horizontal gel electrophoresis apparatus model H5 (Invitrogen) or in 10% polyacrylamide gel (19:1, acrylamide:bis-acrylamide) containing 7.5 m urea using a vertical gel electrophoresis apparatus model V16 (Invitrogen). In both cases, 1× TBE (89 mm Tris, 89 mmborate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) was used as a running buffer (16.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was carried out according to the protocols described previously (16.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Approximately, 1.5 μg of the total RNA from each set was denatured by heating at 70 °C for 15 min in 1× formamide gel-loading buffer (10% formamide, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) followed by a quick chill in icy water. The gel was pre-run for 30 min at 25 watts before samples were loaded. These samples were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 7.5m urea at 20 watts for 2 h using 1× TBE (89 mm Tris, 89 mm borate, and 2 mmEDTA, pH 8.3) as a running buffer. After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed in 7% acetic acid for 30 min. The gel was photographed after staining with ethidium bromide in the 1× TBE for 10 min. The gel was electroblotted at 200 mA for 16 h onto Nytran Plus membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) using the 1× TBE as a running buffer. RNA was fixed onto filters by UV cross-linking (UV Stratalinker, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Pre-hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 6 h in the hybridization buffer (0.2% polyvinyl-pyrrolidone (M r = 40,000), 0.2% Ficoll (M r = 400,000), 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m sodium chloride, 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate (M r = 500,000), and 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA). Following pre-hybridization, hybridization was carried out for 20 h at 42 °C using the 32P-5′-end-labeled ([γ-32P]ATP, catalog number NEG-002Z, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) DNA probes for tRNA3Lys, tRNA1,2Lys (14.Jiang M.

The blot was washed twice in the 2× SSC (0.3 m NaCl, 0.03 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0)/1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min each and once with the 0.2× SSC/1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min. Autoradiography was carried out with intensifying screens at −70 °C and developed by X-Omat (Eastman Kodak Company). Onconase is known to be cytotoxic to mammalian cells by virtue of its RNase activity (3.Wu Y.-N. Mikulski S.M. Ardelt W. Rybak S.M. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10686-10693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In H9 cells, onconase is cytotoxic above 1 × 10−7m (12.Youle R.J. Wu Y.-N. Mikulski S.M. Shogen K. Hamilton R.S. Newton D. D'Alessio G. Gravell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6012-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), whereas at 5 × 10−8m concentrations, it slightly inhibits cell growth but does not degrade either cellular 28 S and 18 S rRNA or certain mRNA species (13.Saxena S.

We examined the effect of extracellular onconase on cultured H9 cells at concentrations ranging from noncytotoxic (1 × 10−9m) to cytotoxic (1 × 10−5m) and examined the degradation of different species of cellular RNA in intact cells (Fig. 1). The gel analysis of total RNA obtained from H9 cells showed that onconase from 10−7 to 10−5m concentrations decreased tRNA levels (Fig. 1 A), whereas even at the cytotoxic concentration of 1 × 10−5m, onconase did not degrade 28 S and 18 S rRNA (Fig. 1 B). This tRNA specificity is also observed when reticulocyte lysate is treated with onconase (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2–4). Specific tRNA degradation products (30–40 residues long) are visible even at 1 × 10−9m onconase concentration (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). It appears that at least 10-fold higher concentrations of onconase are required outside cells to see tRNase activity inside the cells compared with that in the reticulocyte lysate.Figure 2tRNA specificity of onconase in reticulocyte lysate. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate (35 μl) or equivalent amount of purified rabbit reticulocyte lysate RNA was incubated with the specified concentration of onconase (from 1 × 10−9to 1 × 10−7m) in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing phosphate-buffered saline. After incubation at 30 °C for 15 min, the total RNA was isolated using RNAzol, and the RNA pellet was dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA.

In fact, perhaps because of its large size, rRNA is more susceptible to onconase than tRNA (Fig. 2 A, lane 8). One possible explanation for the different RNA specificities of onconase observed in cells and in cell lysates from that of purified RNAs could be that cellular rRNA is bound to proteins and thus protected from onconase in cells and cell lysates, whereas the tRNA is more exposed. Purified rRNA, protein-depleted and more accessible perhaps because of its large size, could engage the ribonuclease at several susceptible sites and thus could be degraded faster than tRNA (Fig. 2 A, lane 8), and this abundance of rRNA substrate may also compete for the degradation of purified tRNA. The protein-RNA complex could also be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent protection of several intracellular mRNAs against the ribonucleolytic activity of onconase, whereas the tRNA species being relatively protein-free remain accessible to onconase catalytic action. To examine whether the association with proteins limits the accessibility of rRNA to onconase, we carried out a spiking experiment in which purified E. coli ribosomal 23 S and 16 S RNA was added to rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The E. coli 23 S and 16 S ribosomal RNAs migrate at different positions than 28 S and 18 S rRNA, allowing protein bound and unbound rRNAs to be assayed in the same reaction milieu. The incubation of the rabbit reticulocyte lysate containing E. coli rRNAs with 1 × 10−8 and 1 × 10−7monconase resulted in clear degradation of the exogenously addedE. coli 23 S and 16 S ribosomal RNA and no degradation of the 28 S and 18 S rRNA in ribosomes (Fig. 3). This finding is consistent with the model that the onconase specificity for tRNA seen in our experiments stems from the shielding of the substrate by associated proteins. Inside the cell, ribonucleases appear to route into the cytosol through the Golgi apparatus. Retinoic acid appears to disrupt the Golgi apparatus (17.Wu Y.N. Gadina M. Tao-Cheng J.H. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and thus facilitates the transport of onconase into the cytosol. Onconase alone was shown to have an IC50 of 1 × 10−6m in 9L rat glioma cells, whereas in the presence of 10 μm retinoic acid, the cytotoxicity was increased 100-fold to an IC50 of ∼1 × 10−8m (4.Wu Y.N. Saxena S.K. Ardelt W. Gadina M. Mikulski S.M. Lorenzo C.D. D'Alessio G. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17476-17481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). An analysis of total RNA obtained from 9L cells treated with onconase at 1 × 10−7 and 1 × 10−5mconcentrations for 20 h with and without all-trans-retinoic acid demonstrated that onconase selectively degraded tRNA, and this activity was potentiated by the presence of retinoic acid (Fig. 4 A). The loss of tRNA at 1 × 10−7m onconase with retinoic acid (Fig. 4 A, lane 5) was the same or greater than the loss of tRNA at 1 × 10−5m onconase alone (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). These results show that the cytotoxic effects of the enzyme correlate well with the degradation of cellular tRNA. Onconase has anti-HIV activity in tissue culture cells (12.Youle R.J. Wu Y.-N.

Although we previously observed degradation of viral RNA and inhibition of viral replication in HIV-1-infected H9 cells exposed to onconase at nontoxic doses, the primary molecular targets of onconase were not well understood. On the basis of the results presented above, the susceptibility of HIV mRNA to degradation by onconase described earlier may stem from relatively less protection by proteins. An initial step in the replication of the HIV-1 is the conversion of the HIV-1 RNA genome into DNA by reverse transcriptase (RT). RT requires a primer for initiation of DNA synthesis, which in the case of HIV-1 is a cellular tRNA3Lys species. This primer tRNA found in HIV-1 particles is selected from the host cell tRNA population during virus assembly. The 3′-terminal 18 nucleotides of the primer tRNA bind to a complementary region of the 5′-U5 region in the long terminal repeat termed as a primer binding site of the HIV-1 RNA genome. Although we have found that onconase inhibits HIV-1 replication at nontoxic doses, its molecular mechanism of antiviral activity remains unknown. HIV-1 mRNA seems to be particularly sensitive to onconase and, based on the results shown here, may stem from a lack of protection by native cellular proteins. However, considering that onconase selectively degrades tRNA, the priming of RT may be inhibited by onconase. Therefore, we examined the tRNA levels in HIV-1-infected cells treated with onconase. Polyacrylamide gel analysis of the total cellular RNA isolated from H9 cells uninfected and persistently infected with HIV-1 incubated with a noncytotoxic concentration of onconase (5 × 10−8m) showed degradation of tRNA only after 4 days (Fig. 5 A, lane 6). It is hard to see any appreciable difference in total tRNA levels on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd day of incubation. Examining certain individual tRNAs yielded a distinctly different result. Probing specifically for tRNA3Lys (Fig. 5 B) by Northern blot analysis of the same gel with a tRNA3Lys specific32P-5′-end-labeled DNA probe revealed that levels of tRNA3Lys in the H9 cells uninfected and persistently infected with the HIV-1 increased within 1 day of treatment with onconase (Fig. 5 B). The increased level of total tRNA3Lys continued through days 2 and 3 and fell back to control levels at day 4. Thus, as total tRNA levels stayed constant, there appeared to be a mixture of tRNA degradation and stimulated tRNA synthesis to maintain constant total levels. A tRNA3Lys precursor band is also seen running above the tRNA3Lysband at days 2 and 3. In addition, degraded forms of tRNA3Lys running at lower molecular weights can be seen as early as day 1 after onconase treatment, consistent with the model of onconase-induced degradation and accelerated resynthesis of tRNA. The tRNAs range from 74 to 96 nucleotides in length and have a cloverleaf-like secondary structure. The tRNAs comprise ∼15% total cellular RNA. Lysine-tRNA has three isoaccepting forms, and all three forms are 76 nucleotides long. The lysine isoacceptor tRNAs differ from the majority of the other tRNA species in containing 2′-O-methylribosylthymine in place of ribosylthymine in loop IV. The tRNA1Lys species differs from tRNA2Lys species by one base pair in the center of the anticodon stem. The anticodon sequence CUU is followed byN-threonyladenosine (18.Raba M. Limburg K. Burghagen M. Katze J.R. Simsek M. Heckman J.E. Rajbhandary U.L. Gross H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 97: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The tRNA3Lys has the anticodon SUU and contains two highly modified thionucleosides where S is 2-thio-5-carboxymethyl-uridine methyl ester, and a further modified derivative of N-threonyladenosine (2-methylthio-N 6-threonyladenosine) is on the 3′ side of the anticodon. The tRNA3Lys differs in positions 14 and 16, respectively, from the other two isoacceptors (18.Raba M. Limburg K. Burghagen M. Katze J.R. Simsek M. Heckman J.E. Rajbhandary U.L. Gross H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 97: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The human tRNAPhe is also 76 nucleotides long and was tested and compared with tRNA1,2Lys and tRNA3Lys for sensitivity to onconase ribonuclease activity. Probing the total RNA isolated from uninfected H9 cells treated with onconase for 24 h with tRNA1,2Lys, tRNA3Lys, and tRNAPhe-specific DNA probes showed that onconase does degrade all three isoacceptor forms of tRNALys as well as tRNAPhe. The different degradation product patterns of the tRNALys isoacceptors and the tRNAPhe suggest that onconase cleaves these tRNA species at different sites (Fig. 6). Because all these species have the same number of nucleotides, onconase may recognize a target sequence located at a different position in the tRNALys and the tRNAPhe species, or onconase catalyzes cleavage of phosphodiester bond(s) at a different nucleotide sequence in these two species. However, the tRNAs may be cleaved at the same site, and differences in secondary structure may contribute to differences in gel mobility. tRNA synthesis is increased upon onconase treatment of cells, and in some cases the level of individual tRNAs may decrease, increase, or stay the same. At high onconase levels, the overall level of tRNA drops, and cells eventually die. We thank Pat Johnson, Joan Barrick, Karen Sanders, and Dr. Motoshi Suzuki for technical assistance in this work.

To clarify the connections among these events, we have evaluated the effect of Ca2+mobilizing agents thapsigargin (Tg), econazole (Ec), and the growth factor Steel Factor (SLF) on bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). BMMC Ca2+ stores were found to consist of a Tg-sensitive ER compartment, the Tg-insensitive SIC store, and mitochondrial stores. Low levels of Ec interfered with Tg-stimulated mitochondrial loading while promoting progressive leakage of Ca2+ from the ER. Low levels of Ec completely reversed Tg toxicity while higher levels blocked store-operated influx and induced cell death in a SLF-enhanced manner. Both Ec and Tg inhibited protein synthesis, however, only SLF plus Tg or very high levels of Ec were able to significantly stimulate EIF-2α phosphorylation. Cycloheximide only partially protected BMMCs from Tg toxicity yet strongly synergized with Ec to induce cell death. These results therefore indicate that although both Tg and Ec deplete ER Ca2+ levels, Ec-induced cell death results from sustained protein synthesis inhibition while Tg toxicity results primarily from mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and secondarily from ER stress associated with Ca2+ depletion.

Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 427-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). ER Ca2+ release stimulates the opening of store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOCs) in the plasma membrane (2.Putney Jr., J.W. McKay R.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), leading to sustained increases in [Ca2+]cwhich can last for several minutes after the initiating signal. In parallel, Ca2+-ATPases located on the ER (SERCA) and plasma membrane actively remove Ca2+ from the cytosol, promoting the return of [Ca2+]c to resting levels. In addition, mitochondrial uptake of Ca2+ can decrease peak [Ca2+]c. As Ca2+-ATPase-induced efflux of Ca2+ decreases [Ca2+]c, mitochondrial Ca2+ is released, thereby extending the total time of the Ca2+ transient (3.Boitier E. Rea R. Duchen M.R. J.

The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive ER compartment can be emptied by exposure to thapsigargin (Tg), which is an irreversible SERCA inhibitor (5.Golovina V.A. Blaustein M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-insensitive compartments of the ER can be further distinguished into ryanodine (ryanodine)/caffeine-sensitive stores and ryanodine/caffeine-insensitive Ca2+ stores (SIC store) (6.Pizzo P. Fasolato C. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Tg is toxic to a variety of cell types and its mechanism of toxicity has been the subject of considerable investigation. One model proposes that the large increase in [Ca2+]c stimulated by Tg is primarily responsible for its toxicity (7.Kass G.E.N. Orrenius S. Environmen. Health Perspect. 1999; 107: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Increased cytosolic Ca2+ content leading to concomitant increases in mitochondrial [Ca2+] can stimulate the mitochondrial permeability transition, initiation of the caspase cascade, and apoptosis (7.Kass G.E.N. Orrenius S. Environmen. Health Perspect. 1999; 107: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). An alternate model proposes that depletion of ER Ca2+ content is a major contributing factor in Tg toxicity. Ca2+-dependent ER-resident chaperones are required to promote protein folding. ER Ca2+ depletion therefore produces unfolded proteins, which tend to self-aggregate, leading to the immobilization of the ER-Golgi transport system (8.Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). It has been documented that Tg-mediated ER Ca2+ depletion can suppress protein synthesis as part of the unfolded protein response. This response is effected through the kinases PKR and PERK which phosphorylate translation initiation factor EIF2α (8.Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar, 9.Corbett E.F. Michalak M. Trends Biochem.

Sci. 1998; 23: 10-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Shutdown of protein synthesis may lead to the induction of apoptosis (11.Bian X. Hughes Jr., F.M. Huang Y. Cidlowski J.A. Putney Jr., J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1241-C1249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar). However, a recent study by Harding et al. (13.Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar) suggested that the inhibition of protein synthesis observed following ER stress was protective under conditions of ER Ca2+ depletion. Similarly, PKR-induced EIF-2α phosphorylation is well accepted as a viral defense mechanism (14.Williams B.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar), supporting the concept that suppression of protein synthesis can be beneficial to the cell. The precise role of protein synthesis regulation in mediating Ca2+depletion-associated stress and anti-viral responses therefore remains undetermined. Since many biological agonists stimulate Ca2+ release from the ER, such signals may also modulate ER stress due to Ca2+ depletion. To clarify the connection between ER Ca2+ depletion, protein synthesis, and cell viability, we have evaluated the effect of Ca2+ mobilizing agent Tg, SOC antagonist Ec, and the growth factor Steel Factor (SLF) on bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). Econazole, like Tg, depletes ER Ca2+ (15.Jan C.R. Ho C.M. Wu S.N. Tseng C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1448: 533-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but unlike Tg also blocks SOC-mediated Ca2+ influx (16.Franzius D. Hoth M. Penner R. Pflugers Arch. 1994; 428: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The ability to decouple ER depletion from influx therefore makes Ec a useful pharmacological tool. BMMCs areex vivo non-adhering mast cells morphologically similar to mucosal mast cells. Ca2+ signals play important roles in a variety of mast cell functions including degranulation (17.Lawson D.

Sittaro D. Klebasz N.Z. Williams D.A. Berger S.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 3734-3742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SLF, the ligand for the c-Kit receptor tyrosine kinase, is one of the primary regulators of mast cell survival, growth, and differentiation (23.Broudy V.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 1345-1364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As with many growth factors and their receptors, one of the key signal transduction events resulting from the binding of SLF to c-Kit is activation of phospholipase C-γ leading to the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ (24.Columbo M. Botana L.M. Horowitz E.M. Lichtenstein L.M. MacGlashan D.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Using the 32D murine myelomonocytic cell line model, we recently demonstrated that phospholipase C-γ activation was essential for the membrane-bound form of SLF to support c-Kit-positive 32D cells in vitro andin vivo (22.Gommerman J.L. Sittaro D. Klebasz N.Z. Williams D.A. Berger S.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 3734-3742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown that inhibition of store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOCs) using Ec, ketotifen, or Ni2+, while concurrently stimulating cells with SLF, results in the induction of activation enhanced cell death (21.Gommerman J.L. Berger S.A. Blood. 1998; 91: 1891-1900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in both BMMCs and 32D-Kit leukemia cells. In the current study, we have established the physiological identities of BMMC Ca2+stores and characterized Ec-induced changes in ER Ca2+content and mitochondrial loading. We further show that in BMMCs depleted of ER Ca2+, suppression of protein synthesis can be either partially protective or profoundly lethal, depending upon the extent and the duration of suppression. BMMCs were generated from C57/Bl6 mice as previously described (25.Berger S.A. Mak T.W. Paige C.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 471Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 4% WEHI-3 supernatant (source of IL-3) for 5 to 10 weeks prior to use in these experiments. All cultures contained 55 μmol/liters β-mercaptoethanol and antibiotics (Sigma). The clonogenicity of treated cells was determined by measuring colony forming ability in semi-solid medium. BMMCs (5 × 104) were incubated in 100 μl of ITS-RPMI in 96-well plates in the presence of treatments for the indicated time periods. At the end of the culture period, BMMCs (104 cells) were transferred into RPMI containing fetal bovine serum (10%), IL-3 (4% WEHI-3 supernatant), SLF (1 μg/ml; produced as previously described (21.Gommerman J.L. Berger S.A. Blood. 1998; 91: 1891-1900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), IL-4 (1.5 ng/ml; R&D Systems, MI), and 0.9% methylcellulose (4000 centipoises; Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver) for 8 to 10 days. At the end of the incubation period, the number of colony forming units was determined. [Ca2+]cmeasurements were performed by flow cytometry. BMMCs (5 × 105 cells/ml) were growth factor-deprived for ∼2 h in Tyrode's buffer (HEPES (10 mm), NaCl (100 mm), KCl (5 mm), CaCl2 (1.4 mm), MgCl2 (1 mm), glucose (5.6 mm), and BSA (0.05%)). Subsequently, cells were incubated in loading buffer (30 min; 5 μm indo-1AM, 0.03% pluronic F-127 in Tyrode's buffer), washed (2 times), and incubated (greater than 15 min; 4 °C) to allow for the complete removal and/or conversion of indo-1AM to Ca2+-sensitive indo-1. Measurements were performed using a laser tuned to 338 nm while monitoring emissions at 405 and 450 nm. The concentration of intracellular free Ca2+ was calculated according to the following formula (26.Grynkiewcz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [Ca2+] i=Kd×(Fmin/Fmax)×(R−Rmin)/(Rmax−R)Equation 1 Where R is the ratio of the fluorescence intensities measured at 405 and 450 nm during the experiments and F is the fluorescence intensity measured at 450 nm.Rmin, Rmax,Fmin, and Fmax were determined from in situ calibration of unlysed cells using 4 μm ionomycin in the absence (Rminand Fmin; 10 mm EGTA) and presence (Rmax and Fmax) of Ca2+. Kd (250 nm) is the dissociation constant for indo-1 at 37 °C.Rmin, Rmax,Fmin, and Fmax varied depending upon settings and were determined at the beginning of each experimental procedure. To quantify the Ca2+content of the SIC store, indo-1-loaded BMMCs were treated with FCCP and Tg to deplete the Ca2+ content of the mitochondria and ER, respectively, in the presence of Ni2+, an inhibitor of transmembrane Ca2+ influx (EGTA caused excessive nonspecific loss of Ca2+ in BMMCs over extended incubation; data not shown). The Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin was then added in the presence of EGTA, which will release all of the remaining Ca2+ from the cell. Based upon the findings of Pizzoet al. (6.Pizzo P. Fasolato C. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), this Ca2+ comes from the SIC store. The magnitude of the ionomycin-induced Ca2+ transient was compared qualitatively between BMMCs under different conditions. Assays for EIF-2α phosphorylation were performed in BMMC cells in the presence of SLF (500 ng/ml) or IL-3 (10% WEHI). Cells were treated with Ec (0, 4, 8, and 12 μm) in the absence or presence of Tg (30 nm) for 30 min or 6 h. After centrifugation (1250 rpm), the cells were lysed in chilled RIPA buffer (Nonidet P-40 (1% v/v), sodium deoxycholate (0.05% w/v), SDS (0.1% w/v)) containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 μg/ml), and protease inhibitor mixture I (Sigma)) by sonication (30 s) followed by an incubation period (30 min; 4 °C). The supernatants (18,000 ×g; 20 min; 4 °C) were stored in aliquots (−20 °C) for subsequent analysis. Proteins were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. After transfer, the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to verify even sample loading. After transfer, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked (1 h, room temperature in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (TBST; Tris (10 mm), NaCl (150 mm), Tween 20 (0.1%), pH 8.0)) containing powdered skim milk (2%; Carnation) and subsequently incubated (overnight, 4 °C) with rabbit anti-mouse EIF-2α (phosphoserine 51 specific; BIOSOURCE International) in 2% blocking solution (1:1000). Membranes were then washed (2 × 7 min) in TBST and incubated with secondary antibody (30 min; goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase; 1:2500 in 2% blocking solution). Membranes were then washed in TBST (3 × 5 min) followed by Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 1 × 5 min; Tris (10 mm), NaCl (150 mm), pH 8.0). Peroxidase activity was visualized using the ECL kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells (5 × 105/sample) were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then re-suspended in ITS-RPMI (RPMI supplemented with insulin (10 μg/ml)-transferrin (5.5 μg/ml)-selenite (5 ng/ml; Sigma) and fatty acid-free BSA (0.05%; Sigma)). Cells were treated with Ec (0, 4, 8, and 12 μm) and/or Tg (30 nm) for 15 min or 5.5 h. After centrifugation (2500 rpm; 5 min), cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]leucine (50 μCi/ml) for 10 min (37 °C; 5% CO2) in leucine-free ITS-RPMI. After two washes in RPMI, pellets were lysed with Triton (50 μl; 0.5% in phosphate-buffered saline) followed by trichloroacetic acid (50 μl, 10% w/v; 4 °C). Samples were washed in trichloroacetic acid (5% w/v), and the protein pellets were re-suspended in microscintillant (Packard, Meriden, CT) and measured using a microplate scintillation counter (Packard). Colony data was analyzed by two-way analysis of variance, with differences between individual means determined by Bonferroni's post-tests. Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. [Ca2+]c was monitored in indo-1-loaded BMMCs by flow cytometry. We found that basal [Ca2+]c in BMMCs was 93 ± 5.8 nm (n = 25). Preliminary studies were performed to assess the identity of ER Ca2+ stores in BMMCs. Exposure to ryanodine did not result in significant increases in [Ca2+]c (Fig. 1A), suggesting that no ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores are present in this cell type. In contrast, exposure of BMMCs to Tg resulted in a large increase in [Ca2+]c even in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1B), consistent with the presence of Tg-sensitive Ca2+ stores. The SIC store is not fully characterized but can be detected by treating cells with Ca2+ ionophore after other stores (i.e.mitochondria and Tg-sensitive stores) have been depleted. We therefore pretreated cells with FCCP and Tg to release Ca2+ from mitochondria and Tg-sensitive stores, respectively, and also incubated cells in Ni2+ to block influx. As shown in Fig. 1B, exposure of these cells to ionomycin/EGTA reveals a pool of Ca2+ indicating the existence of the SIC store (Fig. 1B). Consequently, BMMCs contain three intracellular Ca2+ stores, the mitochondria and two functionally distinguishable ER compartments based upon Tg sensitivity. To determine the direct effects of Ec on Ca2+ stores in BMMCs, a preliminary dose response was performed to determine the effective concentration. In the presence of 0.05% BSA, we observed instantaneous Ec-induced increases in [Ca2+]c at concentrations above 30 μm. Based upon the findings of Gamberucci et al. (27.Gamberucci A. Fulceri R. Benedetti A. Bygrave F.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and our own observations, the presence of BSA decreases free Ec concentrations, thereby accounting for the difference in dose requirement compared with previous studies in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (15.Jan C.R. Ho C.M. Wu S.N. Tseng C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1448: 533-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Under the conditions of the current study, 115 ± 8.4 nm (n = 8) increases in [Ca2+]c which maintained themselves for several minutes after the addition of Ec were observed (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the subsequent addition of Tg (2 μm) failed to stimulate further increases in [Ca2+]c (n = 3), suggesting that Ec induces the release of Ca2+ from Tg-sensitive stores. To determine whether the SIC store is similarly emptied by Ec, residual Ca2+ content following exposure to FCCP and Ec (30 μm) was measured using ionomycin/EGTA. As shown in Fig. 2B, the SIC store was not emptied following Ec exposure (n = 3), suggesting that Tg-sensitive stores are the primary Ec targets. Although no instantaneous Ec-induced changes in [Ca2+]c were observed at concentrations less than 30 μm, the imidazole has potent effects on BMMC viability at much lower concentrations. However, this may be the result of cumulative effects over longer incubation. To assess this possibility, cells were incubated for 3 h with Ec (0, 4, 8, 12, and 15 μm) in the presence of SLF, a Ca2+-mobilizing growth factor or IL-3, a growth-promoting cytokine that does not mobilize Ca2+. Tg was used to release ER Ca2+. We observed that Tg-induced changes in [Ca2+]c were increased in SLF-stimulated cells (Fig. 3A) in comparison with IL-3-stimulated cells (Fig. 3B). However, this difference was lost in the presence of Ec at concentrations greater than 8 μm. Second, the peak Tg-induced [Ca2+]c increased as Ec concentrations increased up to 8 μm, after which point Tg-induced [Ca2+]c began to decrease, with highly significant attenuation of Tg-induced Ca2+ release observed at 15 μm Ec (Fig. 3C). Finally, while Tg-induced changes in [Ca2+]c normally stabilize at a [Ca2+]c well above normal, Ec dose dependently decreased steady state Tg-induced [Ca2+]c between 8 and 15 μm, at which point Tg-induced [Ca2+]c returned to basal levels indicating inhibition of SOC-mediated influx. Two-way ANOVA analysis of the data in Fig. 3C revealed that the differences observed between SLF and IL-3 were significant (p < 0.05), as was the variation due to Ec (p < 0.0001). In the presence of Ni2+, Tg-induced increases in [Ca2+]c come only from internal Ca2+stores. Consequently, comparison of the amount of Tg-releasable Ca2+ can be used to estimate the relative amount of Ca2+ in the Tg-sensitive Ca2+ store. In this case, an acceleration in the rate of [Ca2+]cincrease in the presence of SLF was noted although no overall difference in total Tg releasable Ca2+ was observed between SLF (Fig. 3D) and IL-3 (Fig. 3E). A linear dose-dependent decrease in ER Ca2+ content was observed for Ec between 4 and 15 μm (Fig. 3F). Therefore, Ec induces dose-dependent decreases in ER Ca2+ content which led to enhanced Ca2+ release after the addition of Tg and was enhanced by the presence of SLF. Finally, at the highest doses studied (between 12 and 15 μm) Ec-induced inhibition of Ca2+ influx was observed. BMMCs treated with 2 μm Tg typically displayed a two-step increase in [Ca2+]c (see Fig. 3, A andB, insets). The first step is characterized by a slow, ∼2-fold increase in [Ca2+]c, and is followed by a more rapid and extensive second step with [Ca2+]c peaking between 600 and 1,000 nm. We observed that Ec concentrations as low as 4 μm eliminated the first step of the Tg-induced Ca2+ transient. We also observed that FCCP, the protonophore that collapses the mitochondrial membrane potential preventing Ca2+ entry into the mitochondria, also eliminated the first step of the Tg-induced Ca2+ rise (not shown). These observations therefore suggested that the slower nature of the first step of the Ca2+ rise was due to mitochondrial buffering, and that Ec could interfere with this process. To test this possibility, we pretreated cells with Ec, exposed them to Tg, and then probed mitochondrial Ca2+ content by adding FCCP, which releases mitochondrial Ca2+ into the cytoplasm. As shown in Fig. 4, in the absence of Ec, Tg pretreatment followed by FCCP results in a large increase in [Ca2+]c. In contrast, cells pretreated with Ec failed to release any Ca2+ into the cytoplasm following FCCP treatment. These results therefore suggest that Ec pretreatment interferes with the ability of mitochondria to load Ca2+following release from Tg-sensitive stores. This conclusion is also consistent with the observed rise in peak Tg-induced [Ca2+]c in the presence of 4 or 8 μm Ec (Fig. 3), since Ca2+ that would normally load the mitochondria remains in the cytoplasm. To study the effect of ER Ca2+depletion on mast cell viability, we incubated BMMCs with Tg and Ec and measured their effect on clonogenicity. Preliminary studies showed that incubation of BMMCs with as little as 30 nm Tg was sufficient to reduce clonogenicity by 1 order of magnitude. Surprisingly, we observed that in the presence of SLF, Ec (2 to 4 μm) completely protected mast cells from 30 nm Tg, resulting in an approximate 10-fold increase in colony forming ability (Fig. 5A; p < 0.001). This protection was lost when 8 μm Ec was used, while 12 μm Ec reduced BMMC clonogenicity by greater than 3 orders of magnitude. When BMMCs were treated with Tg (30 nm) and maintained by IL-3 (10% WEHI-3 conditioned medium), protection from Tg toxicity was also observed from 2 to 8 μm Ec (p < 0.001). In addition, colonies (2.Putney Jr., J.W. McKay R.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) were observed in the presence of 12 μm Ec alone, but not in the presence of Tg (Fig. 5B), suggesting that at high concentrations, this antagonism is reversed. Therefore, Ec protected cells from Tg at concentrations where loss of Ca2+ from the ER occurs and mitochondria are blocked from filling with Ca2+, but these compounds synergized to promote cell death at concentrations where Ec also blocks Ca2+ influx. Furthermore, cell death at high Ec concentrations was enhanced by SLF compared with IL-3. As demonstrated above, Tg becomes highly toxic to BMMCs at concentrations which are considerably lower than those typically used to probe ER [Ca2+]. However, at 30 nm, Tg-induced increases in [Ca2+]c (Fig. 6A) were similar in magnitude to Tg (2 μm; Fig. 3)-induced [Ca2+]c, although the rate of [Ca2+]c increase was significantly slower at the lower concentration. Moreover, unlike in response to 2 μmTg, there was little decline in peak [Ca2+]c over the time course of the measurement. Since the clonogenicity studies demonstrated that SLF enhanced cell death in the presence of high Ec concentrations, we measured Tg (30 nm)-induced Ca2+ release in the presence of SLF (Fig. 6A). This resulted in an extremely rapid increase in [Ca2+]c which reached a magnitude higher than in the absence of the growth factor, followed by a slow decline until typical Tg (30 nm)-induced [Ca2+]cwas reached. To assess the ER [Ca2+] independent of influx, these experiments were repeated in the presence of Ni2+ which blocks all Ca2+ influx (Fig. 6B). Unlike in response to 2 μm Tg, [Ca2+]c did not return to normal even 30 min after challenge with the 30 nm concentration of the drug, suggesting only partial emptying of Ca2+ in the ER. In the presence of SLF, however, Tg (30 nm)-induced [Ca2+]c returned to basal levels in under 10 min, supporting the interpretation that SLF enhances Tg-induced emptying of ER Ca2+ content but does not affect cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels. Tg has previously been shown to stimulate EIF-2α phosphorylation resulting in decreases in the rate of protein synthesis. Although some controversy exists regarding the identity of the protein kinase which initiates the unfolded protein response (PERKversus PKR), the target protein for both molecules is EIF-2α. We therefore measured the effect of Tg and Ec on EIF-2α phosphorylation and protein synthesis. As shown in Fig. 7 (panels A and B), 30 nm Tg plus SLF stimulated EIF-2α phosphorylation in BMMCs, correlating with the ER depleting effects of this combination (Fig. 6B). In the presence of SLF, Ec alone also stimulated EIF2α phosphorylation, however, only at the highest concentration tested. In contrast, in the presence of IL-3, 30 nm Tg was insufficient to stimulate significant levels of EIF2α phosphorylation. In fact, in the presence of IL-3, significant EIF2α phosphorylation was only observed following treatment with both 30 nm Tg plus 12 μm Ec. When protein synthesis rates were measured, we observed that both Tg and Ec were able to suppress protein synthesis both alone and in combination (Fig. 7C). However, additive effects of the two compounds were only observed at the higher Ec concentrations. Previous studies have reported that Tg-induced loss of protein synthesis is reversible and that its toxicity can be attenuated by blocking protein synthesis through other means (13.Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar, 28.Aktas H. Fluckiger R. Acosta J.A. Savage J.M. Palakurthi S.S. Halperin J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8280-8285Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ec-induced EIF-2α phosphorylation and protein synthesis inhibition is similarly reversible, EIF-2α phosphorylation and protein synthesis rates were evaluated following a 6-h incubation. As shown in Fig. 8 (panels A and B), both Ec- and Tg-induced EIF2α phosphorylation levels were reduced in all treated cells compared with the 30-min end point. When protein synthesis was measured, we observed that all treated cells showed some degree of recovery, however, significant suppression of protein synthesis was maintained for all cells exposed to toxic levels of Ec alone or Ec plus Tg. These results therefore indicate that sustained suppression of protein synthesis correlates with Ec-mediated toxicity. However, the ability of Ec to protect Tg-treated cells does not correlate with either enhancement or suppression of protein synthesis. To further investigate the role of protein synthesis in mediating ER-associated toxicity, we determined the effect of cycloheximide on both Tg and Ec-induced cell death. As shown in Fig. 9, cycloheximide partially protected BMMCs from 30 nm Tg between 150 ng/ml and 1.5 μg/ml irrespective of the presence of SLF (Fig. 9A) or IL-3 (Fig. 9B). However, at higher concentrations of cycloheximide, this protection was reversed. In contrast, we observed that cycloheximide profoundly enhanced BMMC cell death induced by Ec beginning at 500 ng/ml. Moreover, SLF-induced enhancement of this interaction was observed at 500 ng/ml and 1.5 μg/ml. Since these concentrations of cycloheximide are considerably lower than those typically used in previous studies, we confirmed that protein synthesis inhibition occurs at these concentrations. We observed a 74.2 ± 8.2% decrease in the rate of protein synthesis following a 30-min incubation with 500 ng/ml cycloheximide in the presence of SLF and a comparable 72.5 ± 4.9% decrease in the presence of IL-3. These observations therefore confirm that modest suppression of protein synthesis can partially protect cells from Tg. In contrast, Ec-induced cell death is strongly enhanced by protein synthesis suppression. In this study, we have investigated the relationship between ER Ca2+ depletion, inhibition of protein synthesis, and the induction of cell death in bone marrow-derived mast cells. We found that mast cell Ca2+ stores consist of a Tg-sensitive ER compartment, the Tg-insensitive SIC store and FCCP-sensitive mitochondrial stores. We observed that low levels of Ec interfered with Tg-stimulated mitochondrial Ca2+ loading while promoting progressive leakage of Ca2+ from the ER. Low levels of Ec completely reversed Tg toxicity while higher levels blocked store-operated influx and induced cell death. Both Ec and Tg inhibited protein synthesis, however, only SLF plus Tg or very high levels of Ec were able to significantly stimulate EIF-2α phosphorylation. In addition, we observed that cycloheximide provided only partial protection against Tg toxicity yet profoundly synergized with Ec to induce cell death. These results therefore indicate that although both Tg and Ec deplete ER Ca2+ levels, their mechanism of toxicity in BMMCs is different. Tg's mechanism of toxicity involves primarily mitochondrial loading with Ca2+ and secondarily from ER stress associated with Ca2+ depletion while Ec induces mast cell death through profound, sustained suppression of protein synthesis. Tg induces ER Ca2+ depletion, sustained increases in [Ca2+]c and loading of mitochondria with Ca2+. Several previous studies have attempted to determine which of these events is key to Tg toxicity. Decreased ER Ca2+ content has been shown to prevent normal protein synthesis and trafficking, which can contribute to cell death while sustained increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations can lead to Ca2+ overload-induced apoptosis (7.Kass G.E.N. Orrenius S. Environmen. Health Perspect. 1999; 107: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 29.Orrenius S. Burkitt M.J. Kass G.E.N. Dypbukt J.M. Nicotera P. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 32: S33-S42Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In distinguishing among these mechanisms, the current study provides some insight. First, we observed no difference in steady-state [Ca2+]c (∼500 nm) following the addition of either 30 nm or 2 μm Tg, despite the fact that exposure to these two concentrations leads to a several order of magnitude difference in BMMC clonogenicity. Second, we found that 4 μm Ec could completely protect against 30 nm Tg-induced loss of clonogenicity, although this concentration of Ec had no effect on steady-state Tg-induced [Ca2+]c and in fact increased peak cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels. These two observations both suggest that a large increase in [Ca2+]c does not inevitably lead to toxicity. However, Ec concentrations observed to be completely protective for Tg were found to block loading of mitochondria with Ca2+ with little effect on mitochondrial membrane polarization (data not shown). In addition, under the conditions of the current study, low concentrations of cycloheximide provided only partial protection from the toxic effects of Tg. Taken together, these results suggest that the ER stress associated with Ca2+depletion plays only a partial role, while mitochondrial events play a greater role in mediating Tg toxicity. As shown in Figs. 7 and 8, both Tg and Ec stimulated EIF-2α phosphorylation and suppressed protein synthesis. However, the relationship between these end points, Ca2+ depletion, and mast cell viability is complex. Conditions resulting in enhanced Ca2+ depletion from the ER in general led to increased EIF-2α phosphorylation and enhanced suppression of protein synthesis. However, by 6 h, EIF-2α phosphorylation was lost, even in conditions where significant suppression of protein synthesis was maintained. Furthermore, by the 6-h time point, significant Ec-induced suppression of protein synthesis was only observed at concentrations where it is lethal to mast cells. These observations provide additional support for the interpretation that Ec does not protect Tg-exposed BMMCs through protein synthesis suppression. However, sustained inhibition of protein synthesis does correlate with loss of clonogenicity. The fact that cycloheximide strongly synergized with Ec to promote mast cell death further suggests that profound, sustained protein synthesis inhibition is the major mechanism by which Ec kills mast cells. Protein synthesis inhibition was also identified as a likely cause of growth arrest observed with the related compound clotrimazole (28.Aktas H. Fluckiger R. Acosta J.A. Savage J.M. Palakurthi S.S. Halperin J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8280-8285Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The fact that both Ec and Tg were found to inhibit protein synthesis at concentrations where EIF-2α phosphorylation was not observed may indicate that small, undetectable changes in EIF-2α phosphorylation are sufficient to effect substantial changes in the rate of protein synthesis. Alternatively, ER Ca2+ depletion caused by these compounds may simply block protein synthesis through other pathways (8.Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar,30.Iwawaki T. Hosoda A. Okuda T. Kamigori Y. Nomura-Furuwatari C. Kimata Y. Tsuru A. Kohno K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) or in a nonspecific manner. Future studies may help to clarify the mechanism by which Ec and Tg inhibit protein synthesis. Nevertheless, our observations indicate that ER depletion through the combination of Ca2+ influx blockade with mobilizing agents and biological agonists such as SLF, represents a potent approach for inducing ER-based cell death. A role for mitochondria as Ca2+ buffers has been recognized for many years. It has been reported that mitochondria can accumulate in the immediate vicinities of the ER (5.Golovina V.A. Blaustein M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) or SOCs (31.Hoth M. Fanger C.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Since it is well established that local [Ca2+]c at the site of Ca2+ entry far exceeds global [Ca2+]c and mitochondria cannot fill with Ca2+ at concentrations less than 300–500 nm, it is likely that the cytosolic locations of mitochondria play a key role in their ability to buffer [Ca2+]c. Given our observation that Ec could disrupt mitochondrial Ca2+filling without affecting mitochondrial membrane polarization, it is possible that the imidazole disupts ER-mitochondrial junctions, perhaps by initiating cytoplasmic remodeling systems. Alternatively, Ec may have direct effects on mitochondrial Ca2+ loading via the electrophoretic uniporter. Ec's unique ability to deplete ER Ca2+ stores while preventing mitochondrial loading may prove to be a useful tool in clarifying the role of mitochondria as buffers of Ca2+ transients. Several recent studies have provided evidence that Tg can activate caspases. In particular, the ER-resident cysteine protease caspase 12 is thought to play a pivotal role as an inducer of apoptosis in response to ER stress (12.Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J.

Since caspase 9 is activated upon stimulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition, which can occur in response to mitochondrial loading with Ca2+ (34.Gunter T.E. Buntinas L. Sparagna G. Eliseev R. Gunter K. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), it is possible that the caspase 9-caspase 12 pathway is a major effector of Tg-induced apoptosis. In this context, it is interesting to note that following treatment with Ec that result in greater than 99.9% decreases in BMMC clonogenicity, we observed that only a relatively small percentage of cells display apoptotic phenotypes detectable by Hoechst assays. 2J. Soboloff and S. A. Berger, unpublished data. These results therefore suggest that loss of clonogenicity induced by Ec may occur independent of full caspase activation. In conclusion, we have found that inhibition of protein synthesis associated with the depletion of the Tg-sensitive ER compartment can be partially protective or toxic depending upon the extent and duration of the Ca2+ depletion. Moreover, our observations support a role for both ER Ca2+ depletion and mitochondrial filling rather than cytosolic Ca2+ overload as key inducers of cell death. Since biological agonists such as SLF can enhance the effects of ER Ca2+-depleting agents, our results highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting ER Ca2+ stores, particularly in highly stimulated or activated cells.

While the mechanism of strand exchange remains enigmatic, ATP-induced cooperativity between RecA protomers is critical for its function. A human RecA homolog, human RAD51 protein (hRAD51), facilitates eukaryotic recombination/repair, although its ability to hydrolyze ATP and/or promote strand exchange appears distinct from the bacterial RecA. We have quantitatively examined the hRAD51 ATPase. The catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) of the hRAD51 ATPase was ∼50-fold lower than the RecA ATPase. Altering the ratio of DNA/hRAD51 and including salts that stimulate DNA strand exchange (ammonium sulfate and spermidine) were found to affect the catalytic efficiency of hRAD51. The average site size of hRAD51 was determined to be ∼3 nt (bp) for both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. Importantly, hRAD51 lacks the magnitude of ATP-induced cooperativity that is a hallmark of RecA. Together, these results suggest that hRAD51 may be unable to coordinate ATP hydrolysis between neighboring protomers.

Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All members of the RecA family, including the human RAD51 protein (hRAD51), contain classic Walker A/B motifs, which are fundamentally required for ATP hydrolysis (1.Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Brocchieri L. Karlin S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These motifs are generally conserved among proteins that bind and hydrolyze NTPs (3.Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4248) Google Scholar). RecA proteins mutated at the Walker A/B motifs lack the ability to bind and/or hydrolyze ATP in vitro (4.Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 289-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). While cells expressing these RecA Walker A/B mutants remain viable, they display dramatically reduced levels of recombination and increased radiation sensitivity (5.Konola J.T. Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 20-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).

Each of these homologs is likely to have distinct requirements for ATP binding and/or hydrolysis in recombination/repair. For example, four nonessential RecA homologs have been identified inSaccharomyces cerevisiae: RAD51, RAD55, RAD57, and DMC1 (6.Lovett S.T. Mortimer R.K. Genetics. 1987; 116: 547-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Kans J.A. Mortimer R.K. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 105: 139-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 8.Bishop D.K. Park D. Xu L.

Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Mutation of the Walker A/B motifs of RAD51 and RAD55 results in radiation sensitivity as well as meiotic recombination deficiency (9.Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar,10.Johnson R.D. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4843-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Mutation of the DMC1 Walker A motif results in a dominant meiotic null mutant (11.Dresser M.E. Ewing D.J. Conrad M.N. Dominguez A.M. Barstead R. Jiang H. Kodadek T. Genetics. 1997; 147: 533-544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, similar mutations of RAD57 do not display radiation sensitivity and are only modestly deficient for meiotic recombination (9.Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 10.Johnson R.D. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4843-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The complexity of the recombination/repair system is further amplified in higher eukaryotes, since eight vertebrate RecA homologs have been identified (12.Thacker J. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 166-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In contrast to RecA or the yeast homologs, the vertebrate RAD51 gene appears to be required for cellular viability, since Rad51 −/− mice display early embryo lethality and embryo-derived cell lines could not be established (13.Lim D.S. Hasty P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7133-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 14.Tsuzuki T. Fujii Y. Sakumi K. Tominaga Y. Nakao K. Sekiguchi M. Matsushiro A. Yoshimura Y. Morita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6236-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Similarly, chicken DT40 B-cells lacking endogenous RAD51 were not viable (15.Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Buerstedde J.M. Bezzubova O. Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Takata M. Yamaguchiiwai Y. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results are consistent with the notion that the RecA homologs of higher eukaryotes are not redundant. Interestingly, the chicken DT40 RAD51-deficient cells could be rescued by the overexpression of an hRAD51 Walker A/B mutant protein that was able to bind but not hydrolyze ATP (16.Morrison C. Shinohara A. Sonoda E. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takata M. Weichselbaum R.R. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6891-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, these rescued cells displayed no increase in radiation sensitivity compared with wild type cells but were less efficient at facilitating recombination-dependent gene targeting at several loci (16.Morrison C. Shinohara A. Sonoda E. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takata M. Weichselbaum R.R. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6891-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This data suggests that the contributions of hRAD51 ATP binding and hydrolysis to viability and recombination/repair may be distinct. Biochemical analysis has proven useful in elucidating the role of ATP hydrolysis in the recombination functions of the RecA protein. It has been suggested that cycles of ATP hydrolysis allow protomers within the RecA nucleoprotein filament to alternate between distinct ATP- and ADP-bound conformational states (1.Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Kowalczykowski S.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 539-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The cycling between conformational states appears to drive directional strand exchange during recombination. Historically, these alternating conformations were suspected to facilitate strand exchange by redistributing protomers within the nucleoprotein filament. This assumption was based upon the differential affinities of RecA for DNA in the presence of ATPγS (high affinity) versus in the presence of ADP (low affinity) (1.Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Kowalczykowski S.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 539-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). An alternative model suggested that strand exchange is facilitated by ATP hydrolysis-dependent rotation of the RecA nucleoprotein filament (18.Cox M.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 217-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Time lapse electron microscopy of RecA nucleoprotein filaments formed in the presence of ATPγS appeared consistent with this latter proposal (19.Yu X. Jacobs S.A. West S.C. Ogawa T. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8419-8424Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These slowly hydrolyzing nucleoprotein filaments remained in an extended yet dynamic state, where the protomers appeared to rotate. The coupling of ATP binding/hydrolysis to recombination by hRAD51 is less certain. In comparison with electron microscopy images of RecA, the hRAD51·ssDNA nucleoprotein filaments formed in the presence of ATPγS appeared less extended, suggesting a diminished response to ATP (20.Benson F.E. Stasiak A. West S.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Yet, ATP was required for hRAD51 to extend the helical pitch (DNA-unwinding) of dsDNA (20.Benson F.E. Stasiak A. West S.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) as well as to promote strand exchange between homologous DNA substrates (21.Baumann P. Benson F.E. West S.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 22.Gupta R.C. Bazemore L.R. Golub E.I. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1248-1256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Several recent studies suggest that hRAD51 can be induced to resemble RecA, both structurally and functionally. hRAD51 forms an extended nucleoprotein filament with the transition state mimetic ADP-AlF4− that appears analogous to activated RecA (19.Yu X. Jacobs S.A. West S.C. Ogawa T. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8419-8424Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Two additional reports indicated that yeast and human RAD51-mediated DNA strand exchange is greatly enhanced by ammonium sulfate and/or spermidine (25.Sigurdsson S. Trujillo K. Song B. Stratton S. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8798-8806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 26.Rice K.P. Eggler A.L. Sung P. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38570-38581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The mechanistic basis for ammonium sulfate and spermidine stimulation of RAD51 function is unknown. It is important to note that the rate of RAD51 strand exchange remains 3–5-fold lower than RecA (25.Sigurdsson S. Trujillo K. Song B. Stratton S. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8798-8806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 26.Rice K.P. Eggler A.L. Sung P. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38570-38581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RAD51 converts a maximum of 30–60% of ssDNA to form II products in 60 min, whereas RecA converts 100% ssDNA to form II in 15 min (25.Sigurdsson S. Trujillo K. Song B. Stratton S. Sung P.

Chem. 2001; 276: 38570-38581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Strand exchange by RecA has been shown to be largely independent of ATP hydrolysis (27.Menetski J.P. Bear D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 28.Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, RecA-dependent bypass of heterologous DNA absolutely requires ATP hydrolysis (30.Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 31.Rosselli W. Stasiak A.

ATP hydrolysis-dependent bypass of heterologous DNA has been argued to require the generation of rotory torque and/or recycling of the RecA protomers during the strand exchange reaction (30.Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33.Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17675-17685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). RAD51 displays a dramatically reduced capacity to bypass heterologous DNA during strand exchange (26.Rice K.P. Eggler A.L. Sung P. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38570-38581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 35.Holmes V.F. Benjamin K.R. Crisona N.J. Cozzarelli N.R.

Taken together, these observations suggest that altered ATP processing might account for the disparities between hRAD51 and bacterial RecA activities. To understand the ATP-dependent recombination functions of hRAD51, we have performed the first quantitative examination of the hRAD51 ATPase. Our results allow a detailed comparison with the bacterial RecA protein, the only other homolog in this family in which similar studies have been performed. Of particular importance is our observation that hRAD51 appears to lack the magnitude of ATP-induced cooperativity displayed by RecA. Our results suggest that other regulatory factors or RecA homologs may be required to assemble and control an hRAD51 nucleoprotein filament. Chemicals of the highest grade were obtained from Amresco (Solon, OH) or Sigma. Phosphoric/sulfuric acid-washed charcoal was obtained from Sigma (catalog no. C-5510). ATP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, dissolved in water, and adjusted for pH. ATP concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm with ε = 1.54 × 104. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Bacteriophage φX174 DNA was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Linear, blunt-ended dsDNA (RFIII) was prepared by treatment of bacteriophage φX174 dsDNA (RFI) with endonuclease StuI (New England Biolabs) followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The DNA was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The concentration of DNA is expressed as mol of nt (ssDNA) or bp (dsDNA). hRAD51 was purified as previously described (38.Baumann P. Benson F.E. Hajibagheri N. West S.C. Mutat. Res. DNA Repair. 1997; 384: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with several modifications. Briefly, hRAD51 cDNA was subcloned into pET24d (Novagen), and induction was performed in theE. coli strain BLR21pLysS. Cells were lysed by three freeze/thaw cycles and centrifuged at ∼160,000 × gfor 1 h. The supernatant was dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of 100 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, and 7 mm spermidine HCl. The hRAD51 precipitate was collected by centrifugation and resuspended (∼10 mg/ml) in P buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol) (fraction I). Fraction I was separated by chromatography through Reactive Blue-4-agarose (Sigma). Protein was eluted with a 750 mm step of NaCl and dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of H buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) (fraction II). Fraction II was loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column and eluted with a 750 mm NaCl step (fraction III). Fraction III was dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of H buffer (fraction IV), loaded onto a Mono-Q column (HR5/5 prepacked from Amersham Biosciences), and eluted with a gradient of 150–750 mm NaCl over 20 ml (fraction V). hRAD51 was dialyzed twice against 2 liters of modified H buffer (containing 0.1 mm EDTA) and was stored on ice. Occasionally, an additional purification step was necessary to remove trace contaminants. In this case, the protein was dialyzed against modified P buffer (P buffer containing 100 mm NaCl) after Mono-Q, chromatographed on a Mono-S column equilibrated with modified P buffer, and eluted with a 15-ml gradient of 100–750 mmNaCl. This was followed by dialysis against modified H buffer (0.1 mm EDTA). Purified hRAD51 can be stored in modified H buffer at 0 or −80 °C for several months without appreciable loss of ATPase activity. Protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis (Keck Facility, Yale University). Preparations were found to be nuclease-free by incubation with both single- and double-stranded phage DNA as well as small oligonucleotides. Unless otherwise indicated, the 10-μl reactions contained 1 μm hRAD51 and 6 μmDNA (nt or bp). All reactions were performed in an A buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm magnesium acetate). In addition to the indicated amounts of ATP, 1 μCi of γ-[32P]ATP was included in each reaction. To achieve consistency in such small reactions, mixes containing either DNA/ATP or hRAD51 were added separately using a repeat pipettor (Eppendorf). Reactions were initiated by adding the hRAD51 mix last and incubated at 37 °C for 30–60 min in an Ericomp thermal cycler with a heated lid to prevent evaporation. 400 μl of ice cold 10% activated charcoal (Norit) in 10 mm EDTA was added to terminate the reactions. Tubes were vortexed and placed on ice for a minimum of 3 h to allow maximal binding of free ATP to the charcoal. After centrifugation for 30 min, two 50-μl aliquots were counted by the Cerenkov method. hRAD51 was omitted from two additional reactions, which contained either the lowest or highest amount of ATP. After processing with Norit, background hydrolysis determined for these reactions was averaged and subtracted from reactions containing hRAD51. In general, there was no significant difference in background between lowest and highest ATP reactions. Total counts in each reaction were determined by the Cerenkov method for duplicate reactions that had not been processed with Norit. The average of at least three such duplicates was taken for the total cpm/reaction. Specific activity of ATP (cpm/mol; [γ-32P]ATP/ATP) in each was calculated by dividing the total counts in each reaction by the amount of total ATP. The amount of ATP hydrolyzed (mol) in each reaction was determined by dividing the adjusted hydrolysis value (cpm) by the specific activity of ATP in each reaction. Molar ratios were varied by adjustment of the DNA or hRAD51 concentrations in otherwise identical reactions. In all reactions, conditions were normalized for the DNA or hRAD51 storage buffers. The pH was varied using similar reaction buffers except that MES was used for the range between pH 6.2 and pH 7.2, and HEPES was varied between pH 7.2 and 8.2. For ATPase reactions containing additional salts, 0.5 μl of 2 m (NH4)2SO4(pH 8.0) and/or 0.5 μl of 80 mm spermidine HCl were added to reactions with a final volume of 10 μl, yielding final concentrations of 100 mm and/or 4 mm, respectively. These reactions were processed as above. Using a modification of a previously published method (38.Baumann P. Benson F.E. Hajibagheri N. West S.C. Mutat. Res. DNA Repair. 1997; 384: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we purified hRAD51 to near homogeneity (Fig. 1). The ATPase activity of hRAD51 was measured by the Norit method (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the unique conversion of ATP to ADP was confirmed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) (39.Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We found the Norit method to be superior to TLC or PAGE analysis because of the ease of data acquisition, reduced expense, and the large number of analyses that could be performed in tandem. Past experience has suggested that the separation efficiency of Norit exceeds 90% and can be increased by prolonged incubation of the terminated reactions at 0 °C (39.Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar,40.Adzuma K. Mizuuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6159-6167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While a previous report indicated that ATP hydrolysis by hRAD51 was very inefficient (k cat(ssDNA) = 0.2 min−1, k cat(dsDNA) = 0.1 min−1, k cat = 0.03 min−1), these values were based on a single ATP concentration (200 μm) (21.Baumann P. Benson F.E. West S.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). To confirm and extend these studies and to examine the rate-limiting step(s) within the hydrolysis cycle, we performed classic Michealis-Menten analysis to define theK m and k cat(V max/[hRAD51]o). We determined these values for the hRAD51 ATPase activity in the presence of ssDNA, supercoiled dsDNA (RFI), linear dsDNA (RFIII), and in the absence of DNA. The k cat values (k cat(ssDNA) = 0.21 min−1;k cat(dsRFI) = 0.1 min−1;k cat(dsRFIII) = 0.07 min−1;k cat = 0.07 min−1; Fig. 2, A and B, and Table I) agreed with values previously reported (21.Baumann P. Benson F.E. West S.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). These data indicate that thek cat(ssDNA) for hRAD51 is ∼150-fold lower than bacterial RecA (k cat(ssDNA) = 28 min−1), and the k cat(dsDNA) is ∼220-fold lower than bacterial RecA (k cat(dsDNA) = 22 min−1 at pH 6.2) (41.Weinstock G.M.

In addition, hRAD51 displays an equal or higher apparent affinity for ATP (K m(ssDNA) = 23 ± 3 μm; K m(dsDNA(RFI)) = 27 ± 4 μm;K m(dsDNA(RFIII)) = 26 ± 5 μm; K m = 110 ± 22 μm) compared with bacterial RecA (S0.5(ssDNA)≈ 20–60 μm; S0.5(dsDNA(RFI)) ≈ 100 μm at pH 6.2; S0.5 ≈ 100 μm) (17.Kowalczykowski S.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 539-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 41.Weinstock G.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8845-8849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the substrate concentration where half-maximal activity occurs is S0.5 in a cooperative system and equalsK m in a noncooperative system (44.Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1976: 309-317Google Scholar). In general, DNA appears to decrease the hRAD51 K m equivalently (Fig. 2, A and B, and Table I). Calculation of the hRAD51 ATPase catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) suggests that ssDNA (150 s−1m−1) induces the ATPase no more than 2–3-fold more than dsDNA (∼68 s−1m−1) and at least 5-fold more than in the absence of DNA (11 s−1m−1). The catalytic efficiency of hRAD51 is ∼50-fold less than bacterial RecA (8300 s−1m−1).Table ISummary of hRAD51 ATPase data (see Figs. 2 and 5)ConditionK mV maxk catk cat/K mn Hμmμm · min−1min−1s−1 · m−1ssDNA23 ± 30.211 ± 0.0050.211500.79dsDNA (RFI)27 ± 40.114 ± 0.0030.11680.76dsDNA (RFIII)26 ± 50.071 ± 0.0020.07450.74No DNA110 ± 220.073 ± 0.0060.07110.701.5M NaCl16.9 ± 20.197 ± 0.0060.201900.81 Open table in a new tab A commonly used method for determining ATP-induced cooperativity is by calculating the Hill coefficient (44.Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1976: 309-317Google Scholar). The Hill coefficient was originally developed for the analysis of cooperative fractional saturation for a ligand binding to multiple interdependent sites (45.Dahlquist F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 48: 270-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). If one assumes that the rate of an enzymatic reaction is proportional to the fractional saturation of the enzyme, then a slope (Hill coefficient) greater than one derived from a plot of the fractional rate [v/(V max− v)] versus the substrate concentration ([S]) indicates positive cooperativity (44.Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1976: 309-317Google Scholar). In general, the largest value for cooperativity occurs at half-maximal fractional saturation. As the fractional saturation approaches unity, the Hill coefficient also approaches 1. This appears to be the case for the RecA ATPase (41.Weinstock G.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8845-8849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,46.Mikawa T. Masui R. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The Hill coefficient (n H) of RecA varies from n H = 3 to n H = 11 at ATP concentrations below or slightly above the S0.5. At ATP concentrations above the S0.5 (>100 μm), ATP-induced cooperativity becomes less apparent, since the Hill coefficient equals 1. Three methods of analysis of hRAD51 ATPase data indicate that hRAD51 lacks ATP-induced cooperativity. First, in the absence or presence of DNA, the rate of ATP hydrolysis was easily fit to a simple hyperbolic curve (the Michaelis-Menten equation; Fig. 2 A). Second, the slope of the same ATPase data plotted by the double-reciprocal method is linear (not concave upward; Fig. 2 B). Third, the slope of hRAD51 ATPase data plotted as a fractional rate versus ATP concentration (Hill coefficient) was ∼1 in all conditions (ssDNAn H = 0.79; dsDNA (RFI) n H= 0.76; dsDNA (RFIII) n H = 0.74; absence of DNAn H = 0.70; Fig. 2 C and Table I). hRAD51 also failed to display ATP-induced cooperativity in the range of ATP concentrations below the K m (Fig. 3). These data contrast with the cooperativity shown by RecA. RecA can efficiently utilize dsDNA as a cofactor for hydrolysis at pH 6.2. However, at pH 8.0, the dsDNA-dependent ATPase can only be measured after a lag of several hours (1.Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Kowalczykowski S.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 539-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 42.Weinstock G.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8829-8834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This lag at higher pH is absent when the carboxyl-terminal domain of bacterial RecA is deleted or when purified unwound dsDNA (form X) is used as a cofactor (43.Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1572212276,"Amino acid homology searches of the human genome revealed three members of the metallocarboxypeptidase (metallo-CP) family that had not been described in the literature in addition to the 14 known genes. One of these three, named CPA5, is present in a gene cluster with CPA1, CPA2, and CPA4on chromosome 7. The cDNA encoding a mouse homolog of humanCPA5 was isolated from a testis library and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of human CPA5 has highest amino acid sequence identity (60%) to CPA1. Modeling analysis shows the overall structure to be very similar to that of other members of the A/B subfamily of metallocarboxypeptidases. The active site of CPA5 is predicted to cleave substrates with C-terminal hydrophobic residues, as do CPA1, -2, and -3. Using Northern blot analysis, CPA5 mRNA is detected in testis but not in kidney, liver, brain, or lung. In situ hybridization analysis shows that CPA5 is localized to testis germ cells. Mouse pro-CPA5 protein expressed in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus system was retained in the particulate fraction of the cells and was not secreted into the media. Pro-CPA5 was not enzymatically active toward standard CPA substrates, but after incubation with prohormone convertase 4 the resulting protein was able to cleave furylacryloyl-Gly-Leu, with 3–4-fold greater activity at pH 7.4 than at 5.6. Two additional members of the human CP gene family were also studied. Modeling analysis indicates that both contain the necessary amino acids required for enzymatic activity. The CP on chromosome 8 is predicted to have a CPA-like specificity for C-terminal hydrophobic residues and was named CPA6. The CP on chromosome 2 is predicted to cleave substrates with C-terminal acidic residues and was named CPO.

All metallo-CPs, including those from bacteria and plants, can be divided into one of two subfamilies based on consideration of the overall domain structure as well as on amino acid sequence similarities. One subfamily, which includes the digestive enzymes CPA1, CPA2, and CPB1 has been previously referred to as the “pancreatic” subfamily but is more appropriately referred to as the “A/B” subfamily. All members of the A/B subfamily contain an ∼90 amino acid-long N-terminal “pro” region that functions as a chaperone to assist with the folding of the active CP domain. In addition, this pro domain also functions as an inhibitor of the CP, with full activity requiring endopeptidase cleavage of the pro domain in one or more places. Cleavage releases the active CP domain, which is ∼300 residues long and does not contain any additional domains. carboxypeptidase furylacryloyl prohormone convertase 4 and 7, respectively root mean square reverse transcription expressed sequence tag 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol carboxypeptidase furylacryloyl prohormone convertase 4 and 7, respectively root mean square reverse transcription expressed sequence tag 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol The other subfamily of metallo-CPs includes CPN, CPE, CPM, CPD, and others (1.Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998: 1318-1320Google Scholar, 11.Reznik S.E. Fricker L.D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1790-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although this subfamily has been referred to as “regulatory” CPs, this name is not ideal, because most of these enzymes are poorly regulated, whereas one of the members of the A/B subfamily, CPB2 or CPU, is highly regulated (4.Hendriks D.F. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998: 1328-1330Google Scholar). Thus, this second subfamily has been recently renamed the N/E subfamily to reflect the first two members that were discovered (11.Reznik S.E. Fricker L.D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1790-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In contrast to the A/B subfamily members, all members of the N/E subfamily contain several domains in addition to the active CP domain and the signal peptide (11.Reznik S.E. Fricker L.D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1790-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Also, members of the N/E subfamily lack pro domains that function as enzyme inhibitors; some lack this region entirely (CPM, CPN, CPD), whereas another member (CPE) contains a short pro domain that has an unknown function (7.Fricker L.D. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998: 1341-1344Google Scholar, 8.Skidgel R.A. Erdos E.G. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D.

A domain common to all members of the N/E subfamily is a transthyretin-like folding domain that is immediately C-terminal to the active CP domain (13.Gomis-Ruth F.X. Companys V. Qian Y. Fricker L.D. Vendrell J. Aviles F.X. Coll M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5817-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14.Aloy P. Companys V. Vendrell J. Aviles F.X. Fricker L.D. Coll M. Gomis-Ruth F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16177-16184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The function of this domain is not yet clear. In addition to the transthyretin-like domain, members of the N/E subfamily contain domains that are thought to function in protein-protein and/or protein-membrane interactions and that target the protein to specific compartments within the secretory pathway or outside the cell (11.Reznik S.E. Fricker L.D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1790-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence identities within members of each subfamily (typically 35–65%) are higher than between subfamilies (15–25%). The three-dimensional structures of members of each subfamily show many similarities within the core, although there are major differences within several of the loops near the active site cleft (14.Aloy P. Companys V. Vendrell J. Aviles F.X. Fricker L.D. Coll M. Gomis-Ruth F.X. J. Biol.

The active site and substrate-binding residues are generally conserved among all members of the two subfamilies that display enzymatic activity; one or more critical residues are missing in some members of the N/E subfamily that do not appear to encode active carboxypeptidases such as CPX1, CPX2, AEBP1, and the third CP-like domain of CPD (11.Reznik S.E.

The objective of the present study was to determine whether additional metallo-CP genes exist in the human genome. Homology searches were used to identify three novel human CP-like genes. One of these is related to the sequence of a mouse testis cDNA clone of unknown function (GenBank™ accession number AK015256), which we have named CPA5. The GenBank™ sequence does not contain a long open reading frame due to a frameshift with respect to the predicted human genomic sequence; the quality of the mouse sequence data was not reported. Another of the novel human CP-like genes was identical within exons 1–8 to a cDNA sequence previously found in human hematopoietic stem cells (GenBank™accession number AF221594). However, this putative stem cell protein would not encode an active CP due to the absence of exons 9–11, which contain critical residues for enzyme activity. The present search revealed these missing exons downstream of exon 8, and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was used to confirm the predicted exon splicing of this region of the gene. Finally, a third completely novel CP-like gene was identified. Although related to cDNA sequences found in several nonmammalian species, no mammalian cDNAs representing this gene have been described. Modeling of the three novel CPs was performed to determine whether these gene products were likely to encode active CPs and, if so, to predict their substrate preference for aliphatic, basic, or other amino acids. In addition, the tissue distribution of pro-CPA5 mRNA and the preliminary characterization of CPA5 enzymatic activity was performed. The NCBI Web site was used to search the public human genome data base with various human CP sequences using the tblast-n program and the default parameters. To identify additional exons and to determine the nucleotide sequence of the exon/intron junctions, the genomic sequences that corresponded to the novel CP-like genes on chromosomes 7, 8, and 2 were downloaded from the NCBI site. These sequences were translated in all three reading frames, and the deduced amino acid sequences were searched for homology to various CPs using the GenePro program (Hoeffer Scientific). Because the amino acid sequence similarity within the N-terminal precursor regions of the CPs is low, these regions could not be identified from this homology-based approach. Searches of the expressed sequence tag (EST) data base on the NCBI Web site using the blast-n program revealed matches to the 5′ region of the novel CP-like genes on chromosomes 7 and 8. Several of these EST sequences extended in the 5′ region into the putative signal peptide and pro region, so they were used to search the human genome data base and obtain the 5′ exons for this N-terminal region. Predictions on the presence of N-terminal signal peptides and putative cleavage sites of these peptides were performed using the Signal-P Web site (20.Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar). The set of template structures used for modeling the target sequences was chosen in every case based on closest sequence similarity. The following templates were used: bovine pro-CPA1, porcine pro-CPA1, and human pro-CPA2 for the proenzyme sequence of CPA5 and human pro-CPB1, porcine pro-CPB1, human pro-CPA1, and human pro-CPA2 for the proenzyme sequence of CPA6 and CPO. All of the proteins were extracted from the Protein Data Bank (Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ) except human pro-CPB1. 2P. J. Pereira, S. Segura-Martin, C. Ferrer-Orta, J. Vendrell, F. X. Aviles, M. Coll, and F. X. Gomis-Ruth, manuscript in preparation. A preliminary multiple alignment was performed for the three sets of template proteins plus the target sequence using the program ClustalW (21.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar) and a BLOSUM 62 matrix for weighting. To correctly align the target and the template sequences, data on the secondary and tertiary structures for this set of proteins were added. The secondary structure of the target proteins was predicted with the program PHD (22.Rost B. Sander C. Schneider S. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 53-60PubMed Google Scholar), and the real secondary structure of the templates was calculated with the program DSSP (23.Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (11986) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of the chosen templates were structurally superimposed by use of the program SSAP (24.Orengo C.A. Brown N.P. Taylor W.R. Proteins. 1992; 14: 139-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and the multiple alignments of the templates were modified according to the three-dimensional superimposition of the templates. Subsequently, the sequence of each target sequence was used to obtain a final multiple alignment accounting for the structure of the templates, which was manually refined to account again for the structural information obtained from the template superimposed structures plus the predicted and real secondary structure. A method of comparative modeling by satisfaction of spatial constraints was used to build the three-dimensional structure of pro-CPA5, pro-CPA6, and CPO. This method was implemented using the program MODELLER (25.Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10294) Google Scholar). The spatial constraints were derived by transferring the spatial features from the structures of the known proteins to the sequence of the unknown one. Idealization of bond geometry and removal of unfavorable nonbonded contacts were performed by energy minimization with the GROMOS force field for unsolvated systems (26.van Gunsteren W.F. Berendsen H.J.C. Groningen Molecular Simulation (GROMOS) Library Manual. Groningen, The Netherlands1987Google Scholar, 27.Oliva B. Wastlund M. Nilsson O. Cardenas R. Querol E. Aviles F.X. Tapia O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The model was refined using 1000 steps of steepest descent. Root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation calculations and superimposition of the modeled structures with respect to the crystallographic ones were obtained by means of the program SSAP. Secondary structure calculations of the crystallographic structures and the model were performed with DSSP (23.Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (11986) Google Scholar) and compared with the predicted secondary structure. The program PROSA-II (28.Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar) was used to check the quality of the models. This program allows identification of regions with non-near-native fold by the high positive values of pseudo-potential energy. The model showing the smallest pseudoenergy was taken for the final modeled structure. Mouse full-length CPA5 cDNA was generated by performing high fidelity PCR using thermostable Taq and the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity ofPwo (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with a mouse BALB/c testis cDNA library (CLONTECH). The forward primer ATA AGA ATG CGG CCG CTT GTC TGG AAG GAG AAG C included aNotI site at its 5′-end. The reverse primer GGG GTA CCG AAT TCT AGT GAT GAT GAT GAT GAT GAT AGG GGT GAT TCA GGG TGT G includedKpnI and EcoRI sites and a His tag sequence at its 5′ end. The PCR product was purified (PCR purification kit; Qiagen), digested with NotI and EcoRI, and subcloned into the baculovirus expression vector pVL1392 (Invitrogen). To generate a probe for Northern blotting analysis, the purified PCR product was digested with NotI and HincII and subcloned into pBluescript KS vector (Stratagene). All positive clones were confirmed by sequencing. Total RNA was prepared using the lithium chloride method (29.Auffray C. Rougeon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar), and ∼20 μg was fractionated on an agarose gel containing 2% formaldehyde. Following photography of the ethidium bromide-stained gel, the RNA was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with CPA5 riboprobe. The 500-nucleotide-long probe was produced using theHindIII-linearized mouse CPA5 vector described above, T3 RNA polymerase, and [32P]UTP. Approximately 4 × 107 cpm of probe was hybridized with the blot in 5× saline-sodium phosphate-EDTA buffer, 5× Denhardt's solution, 50% (v/v) formamide, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 64 °C overnight. Following the hybridization, the blot was washed with 1× standard saline citrate (SSC) and 0.1% SDS, 0.5× SSC plus 0.1% SDS, and then 0.1× SSC plus 0.1% SDS buffer at 72 °C. After washing, the blot was dried and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 3 days at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. RT-PCR was performed using the Titan one tube RT-PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). RNA was extracted using the lithium chloride method (29.Auffray C. Rougeon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar) from various mouse tissues, AtT-20 cells, or human mononuclear cells prepared from fetal cord blood as described (30.Robinson J.P. Darzynkiewicz Z. Dean P.N. Dressler L.G. Rabinovitch P.S. Stewart C.C. Taube H.J. Wheeless L.L. Current Protocols in Cytometry. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 5.1.1Google Scholar). For mouse CPA5, the forward and reverse primers were the same as used for the isolation of CPA5 cDNA from the testis library (above). For human CPA6, the forward primer was TGG ATG CAT CAT CTG AAT AAA ACT CAC, and the reverse primer was TCC ATT TTT GTA GGC CCA ATC CAT. For mouse CPA6, the same forward primer was used, but the reverse primer was chosen from a region with lower degeneracy: CTT CAC TTT CCA GTT TCT ATT GGC ATC. The PCR products were purified (PCR purification kit; Qiagen) and subcloned into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmids were sequenced in both directions. All experiments carried out in this study used antisense cRNA probes and sense probes for controls. Probes were synthesized by in vitro transcription of linearized plasmid DNA (CPA5 in pBluescript, described above), and labeling was done by incorporation of radioactive [35S]UTP and [35S]CTP nucleotides (Amersham Biosciences) as described (31.Schafer M.K.H. Day R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 23: 16-44Google Scholar). The in situ hybridization studies were carried out using antisense and sense [35S]UTP/[35S]CTP-labeled cRNA probes. Radioactive probes were diluted to 33 × 103 dpm/μl and in situ hybridization was performed as previously described (31.Schafer M.K.H. Day R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 23: 16-44Google Scholar). CD1 mice were sacrificed by rapid decapitation, and tissues were rapidly removed and frozen in isopentane cooled to −35 °C. The extracted tissues were stored at −80 °C until cryosectioning. Frozen 10-μm sections were cut on a Reichert cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Depew, NY), thaw-mounted on polylysine-coated glass slides, and stored at −80 °C until processing. These sections were submitted to the standard in situ hybridization procedure (31.Schafer M.K.H. Day R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 23: 16-44Google Scholar) followed by x-ray film autoradiography for 4 days to obtain low resolution images. These slides were subsequently dipped in NTB-2 nuclear emulsion (Eastman Kodak Co.) to obtain cellular resolution. The sections were counterstained with cresyl violet, cleared in xylene, and mounted with Permount histological mounting medium (Fisher). Recombinant baculovirus expressing mouse pro-CPA5 was generated using Baculoplatinum DNA (Orbigen). Approximately one million Sf9 cells growing in Sf900-II serum-free medium (Invitrogen) were co-transfected with 5 μg of the pro-CPA5 pVL1392 vector along with 0.5 μg of Baculoplatinum DNA using the standard calcium phosphate procedure (18.Xin X. Day R. Dong W. Lei Y. Fricker L.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 897-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Amplifications of the virus were performed as previously described (18.Xin X. Day R. Dong W. Lei Y. Fricker L.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 897-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells from 450 ml of culture were recovered by centrifugation at 50,000 × gat 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were homogenized (Polytron; Brinkman) in 100 ml of 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was homogenized in 0.1 m Tris-Cl containing 1 m NaCl and centrifuged at 50,000 × g. This pellet was homogenized in 0.1 m Tris-Cl containing both 1 m NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged again as above. The final pellet was resuspended in Tris buffer, and aliquots of each supernatant and the final pellet were analyzed on two denaturing polyacrylamide gels. One gel was stained with Coomassie while the other was transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody to the His6 epitope (Invitrogen). The supernatant from the 1 m NaCl extract was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, overnight and centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Both supernatant and pellet were analyzed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (both protein and Western blot analysis, as above). The major protein bands in the precipitate fraction were cut from the gel, digested with trypsin (Promega), and subjected to mass spectrometry as previously described (32.Varlamov O. Kalinina E. Che F. Fricker L.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 311-322PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting fragments were compared with the theoretical masses of pro-CPA5 tryptic fragments predicted using the Paws computer program. Because the gel analysis revealed the size of the expressed protein to be that of pro-CPA5 and not the predicted active form, attempts were made to process the pro-CPA5 using a variety of endopeptidases. The pro-CPA5 could not be purified using the Talon His6 purification procedure (CLONTECH). Because the pellet after the dialysis of the 1 m NaCl cell extracts contained pro-CPA5 as one of the major components (based on the tryptic fingerprinting results), this material was used for subsequent studies on pro-CPA5. Approximately 5–10 μg of pro-CPA5 (estimated from the Coomassie-stained protein gel) was incubated with a variety of endoproteases in the following buffer: porcine trypsin (Promega), 0.1m Tris, pH 7.4; purified baculovirus-expressed human furin (33.Fugère M.

Toure B.B. Lazure C. Mbikay M. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.0, with 2 mm CaCl2. For furin and the PCs, enzyme activity was verified with the standard substrate pyro-Glu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (34.Basak A. Toure B.B. Lazure C. Mbikay M. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To measure CP activity, 5–10 μl of each sample (corresponding to 125–250 ng of pro-CPA5 prior to incubation with PC4) was added to 0.5 ml of 500 μm furylacryloyl-Gly-Leu (FA-Gly-Leu) in either 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, or 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, at 25 °C. The enzyme reaction was followed by measuring the decrease in absorption at 336 nm; controls with bovine CPA1 (Sigma) showed a maximal change of 0.6 absorption units for the batch of substrate used. When CPE was used to search the public human genome data base using the tblast-n program, each known member of the N/E subfamily was detected, but no additional genes were found (Table I). None of the N/E subfamily genes appeared to be present as a cluster; although chromosome 4 contains both CPE and CPZ, and chromosome 10 contains both CPN and CPX2, these genes are located at a considerable distance from each other within the chromosome. Similarly, none of the members of the N/E subfamily were located in close proximity to members of the A/B subfamily. Searches with CPE produced a limited number of hits to members of the A/B subfamily, as expected due to the generally low amino acid sequence identity between subfamilies.Table IGenomic location of human metallocarboxypeptidase-related genesGeneChromosomeCommentsA/B subfamily CPA17 CPA27 CPA33Previously “mast cell CPA,” now CPA3 in GenBank™.

https://openalex.org/W1968047991,"Leishmania was found deficient in at least five and most likely seven of the eight enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway, accounting for their growth requirement for heme compounds. The xenotransfection of this trypanosomatid protozoan led to their expression of the mammalian genes encoding δ-aminolevulinate (ALA) dehydratase and porphobilinogen deaminase, the second and the third enzymes of the pathway, respectively. These transfectants still require hemin or protoporphyrin IX for growth but produce porphyrin when ALA was supplied exogenously. Leishmania is thus deficient in all first three enzymes of the pathway. Uroporphyrin I was produced as the sole intermediate by these transfectants, further indicating that they are also deficient in at least two porphyrinogen-metabolizing enzymes downstream of porphobilinogen deaminase, i.e. uroporphyrinogen III co-synthase and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. Pulsing the transfectants with ALA induced their transition from aporphyria to uroporphyria. Uroporphyrin I emerged in these cells initially as diffused throughout the cytosol, rendering them sensitive to UV irradiation. The porphyrin was subsequently sequestered in cytoplasmic vacuoles followed by its release and accumulation in the extracellular milieu, concomitant with a reduced photosensitivity of the cells. These events may represent cellular mechanisms for disposing soluble toxic waste from the cytosol. Monocytic tumor cells were rendered photosensitive by infection with uroporphyric Leishmania, suggestive of their potential application for photodynamic therapy.

Monocytic tumor cells were rendered photosensitive by infection with uroporphyric Leishmania, suggestive of their potential application for photodynamic therapy. Leishmania, like other trypanosomatid protozoa, are among the rare examples of aerobic organisms, which depend on oxidative phosphorylation (for Leishmania mexicana andLeishmania amazonensis, see Refs. 1.Hart D.T. Coombs G.H. Exp. Parasitol. 1982; 54: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar and 2.Bermúdez R. Dagger F. D'Aquino J.A. Benaim G. Dawidowicz K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but are defective in the synthesis of heme (3.Chang C.S. Chang K.-P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) required for electron transport respiratory complexes. This peculiar defect in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis is manifested as a nutritional requirement for hemin by these organisms in chemically defined medium (for review, see Ref. 3.Chang C.S. Chang K.-P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In nature, these parasitic protozoa must acquire protoporphyrin IX or heme exogenously from their hosts as a nutritional factor (3.Chang C.S. Chang K.-P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Exceptional are several entomophilic nonpathogenic Crithidiaspecies that harbor β-proteobacteria as endosymbionts presumably to help them complete the heme biosynthetic pathway, thereby sparing their nutritional requirement for hemin as an essential growth factor (4.Du Y. Maslov D.A. Chang K.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8437-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Earlier biochemical studies of trypanosomatid protozoa have shown that they are deficient in heme biosynthesis (3.Chang C.S. Chang K.-P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 5.Chang K.-P. Chang C.S. Sassa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This was examined according to the following conventional pathway: glycine + succinyl-CoA or 4,5-dioxovalerate + alanine → δ-aminolevulinate (ALA) 1The abbreviations used are: ALAδ-aminolevulinateALADδ-aminolevulinate dehydratasePBGDporphobilinogen deaminase1The abbreviations used are: ALAδ-aminolevulinateALADδ-aminolevulinate dehydratasePBGDporphobilinogen deaminase → porphobilinogen → hydroxymethylbilane (by-product = uroporphyrinogen I) →uroporphyrinogen III → co-proporphyrinogen III→ protoporphyrinogen IX→ protoporphyrin IX→ heme (9.Sassa S. Beutler E. Lichtman M.A. Coller B.S. Kipps T.J. William's Hematology. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 726-746Google Scholar). Table I lists the eight enzymes, which are known to catalyze this pathway. The activities of these enzymes are often undetectable or negligible in trypanosomatid protozoa. Reported previously in these organisms were the activities of ALA-synthase/dioxovalerate transaminase and ferrochelatase (7.Srivastava P. Sharma G.D. Kamboj K.K. Rastogi A.K. Pandey V.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 171: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 8.Sagar R. Salotra P. Bhatnagar R. Datta K. Microbiol.

Lichtman M.A. Coller B.S. Kipps T.J. William's Hematology. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 726-746Google Scholar). Much less or absent are activities of the second and the third enzymes, i.e. δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase (ALAD, EC 4.2.1.24) and porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD, EC4.3.1.8) (3.Chang C.S. Chang K.-P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 5.Chang K.-P. Chang C.S. Sassa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1997; 171: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The pathway thus appears to be incomplete in this group of organisms (3.Chang C.S. Chang K.-P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 6.Salzman T.A. Stella A.M. De Xifra E.A.W. Batlle A.M.D.C. Docampo R. Stoppani A.O.M. Comp. Biochem.

Endosymbionts are thought to complement this incomplete pathway in their Crithidia host by supplying the missing enzymes, i.e. PBGD (5.Chang K.-P. Chang C.S. Sassa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These organisms normally infect mammalian macrophages as intracellular parasites and acquire heme via the activity of their host cells (3.Chang C.S. Chang K.-P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We report here that transgenicLeishmania with alad and pbgd became highly porphyric when supplied with ALA, indicative of their deficiencies in δ-aminolevulinate synthase in addition to ALAD and PBGD. The production of uroporphyrin I as the sole intermediate under these conditions also indicates the deficiency of porphyrinogen-modifying enzymes further downstream of the pathway. Supplying the transfectants with exogenous ALA caused cellular accumulation of uroporphyrin I followed by its release. The infection of monocytic tumor cells in vitro with these porphyricLeishmania followed by UV irradiation resulted in their cytolysis, suggestive of its potential application for photodynamic therapy of various diseases. Wild type L. amazonensis (LV78) promastigotes (clone 12-1) were grown at 25 °C in Hepes-buffered Medium199 to pH 7.4 and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Transfectants were grown under similar conditions with different concentrations of selective pressure, i.e.G418 and/or tunicamycin. Cells were also adapted to grow in a chemically defined medium (11.Steiger R.F. Steiger E. J. Parasitol. 1976; 62: 1010-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To initiate such cultures, cells were washed twice with the defined medium by centrifugation at 3500 ×g for seeding at 2–5 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were counted using a hemacytometer. Macrophages (J774A1) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium-supplemented with 10 or 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 35 °C. Cultures of all cells rendered porphyric were kept in the dark to avoid cytolysis because of photosensitivity. For all microscopic examinations of Leishmania, living cell suspension in 5–10 μl aliquots was placed on a glass slide and then covered with an 18 mm2 glass coverslip. For routine examinations, the preparations were viewed under phase contrast for cellular structures in conjunction with epifluorescence for porphyrins using a filter set consisting of D405/10X (405 nm exciter), 485DCXR (485 nm dichroic) and RG610LP (610 nm emitter) (Chroma Tech Co., Brattleboro, VT) in a Zeiss standard microscope with super pressure mercury lamp (HBO 50 W, Osram). Images were obtained by confocal microscopy using an Olympus FluoView confocal microscope equipped with a krypton/argon-mixed gas laser. Specimens were illuminated with the 488 nm excitation line. The specific fluorescent emission of the porphyrin was collected by a photomultiplier tube after passing through a 605 nm bandpass emission filter. Differential interference contrast images were simultaneously collected using a transmission field detector coupled to a photomultiplier tube. Detection settings were determined using a negative control by adjusting the gain and offset settings to eliminate background. Images were collected using a ×100 oil immersion objective (NA 1.40) with an electronic zoom of ×3. The confocal aperture was set to 5 mm to maximize the depth of field within the specimen. Digital image acquisition took ∼7 s/frame, resulting in movement-induced blurring of the flagella in viable specimens. Images were composed in Adobe Photoshop. Only differential interference contrast images were adjusted for brightness. The cDNA of rat pbgd(1038 bp) (GenBank™ accession number X06827) (12.Stubnicer A.C. Picat C. Grandchamp B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was obtained by digesting the plasmids with BamHI. The humanalad (993 bp) (GenBank™ accession numberM13928) (13.Beaumont C. Porcher C. Picat C. Nordmann Y. Grandchamp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14829-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified from a cDNA cloned in pGEM vector using a high fidelity Taq polymerase (Expand Hi Fi, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The forward and reverse primers used were 5′-TGCCCACTGGATCCCCGCCATG-3′ and 5′-CACTGGGATCCATCATTCCTCC-3′. To facilitate cloning into the Leishmania expression vectors, the primer sequences were designed to include BamHl sites (underlined) flanking the PCR products. The amplified products of alad was first cloned in pGEM-T for expansion and then gel-purified afterBamHI digestion for cloning intoLeishmania-specific vector, pX-neo (14.Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The ratpbgd was cloned into p6.5 withN-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase gene for tunicamycin-resistance (15.Liu X. Chang K.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4112-4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16.Kawazu S.-I. Lu H.G. Chang K.P. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 196: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 17.Chen D.Q. Kolli B.K. Yadava N. Lu H.G. Gilman-Sachs A. Peterson D.A. Chang K.-P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The clones with the inserts in correct orientation were identified by restriction mapping. Promastigotes were transfected with pX-alad and/or p6.5-pbgd (see Fig. 1) by electroporation as described earlier (18.McGwire B. Chang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7903-7909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and selected initially for resistance of up to 10 μg of tunicamycin/ml or 20 μg of G418/ml or a combination of both. Stable transfectants emerged in 8–10 days and were subsequently passaged continuously in media with appropriate drug pressures. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 3500 × g, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and lysed by three cycles of freezing-thawing in dry ice/acetone bath. Cell lysates equivalent to 20–50 × l06 cells and to 2–5 × 106 cells were used for ALAD and PBGD assays, respectively. The activity of ALAD was assayed by monitoring the absorption at 553 nm of the color salt of porphobilinogen using the modified Ehrlich reagent as described previously (19.Sassa S. Enzyme (Basel). 1982; 28: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). PBGD activities were assayed by a microfluorometric method (20.Sassa S. Granick S. Bickers D.R. Bradlow H.L. Kappas A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Porphyrin levels were determined fluorometrically using 5 μl of cell suspensions (2–5 × 106 cells/ml) and 0.5 ml of 1 m perchloric acid/methanol (1:1, v/v) as described previously (21.Kappas A. Song C.S. Sassa S. Levere R.D. Granick S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 64: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Samples were assayed for proteins using Coomassie Blue R-250 binding dye. The type of porphyrins produced was determined by thin-layer chromatography of relevant samples using porphyrin ester chromatographic marker kit as the standard (Porphyrin Products Co., Logan, UT). Cells were grown in porphyrin-free chemically defined medium to 3–4 × 108 cells. Porphyrins were extracted from the cell pellets, methylated, and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography as described previously (22.Anderson W.L. Shechter Y. Parikh I. Anal.

Stable transfectants grown in Medium199 supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and selected with appropriate drugs were assessed for the presence of ALAD and PBGD by Western blot analysis. Protein samples each equivalent to 20 × l06 cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE using MiniProtean II (Bio-Rad) and blotted to nitrocellulose. The primary anti-PBGD and anti-ALAD antisera were generated by immunization of rabbits with purified enzymes (23.Sassa S. J. Exp. Med. 1976; 143: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Both were used at 1:105dilution. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) was used as the secondary antibody. Immunoblots were subsequently developed with the ECL reagent and exposed to x-ray films. For these experiments, transfectants with alad and pbgd and those with pbgdalone were grown in chemically defined medium supplemented with up to 1.6 mm ALA to generate different levels of porphyria. Cell suspensions in 24-well microtiter plates (107promastigotes/ml/well or 5 × 106 promastigotes + 5 × 105 J774A1 macrophages/ml/well) were irradiated after infection or immediately at room temperature under a long wave UV lamp (254–366 nm multi-bands, Mineralight Lamp, Model UVSL-58, Ultraviolet Products, Inc, San Gabriel, CA) placed ∼5 cm above the cell layers. Porphyric Leishmania prepared under other conditions and their spent media with different concentrations of released porphyrins were also examined for their effects on J774A1 cells. After illumination for variable time periods, cells were microscopically examined immediately. Cells of the monocytic tumor line were counted using a hemacytometer 1–2 days after irradiation. All experiments were repeated at least twice. Western blot analysis of various cell lysates revealed that both enzymes were undetectable in the wild type (Fig. 2, lane 1) and appeared as specific protein bands of the expected size (Fig. 2, lanes 2–5) in the transfectants. Probing the blots with anti-ALAD antiserum alone revealed a single band of ∼36 kDa in the transfectants with pX-alad (panel A, lane 2) and those with this plasmid in combination with p6.5-pbgd (panel A, lane 5) but not in those with p6.5-pbgd and p6.5-pbgd + pX (panel A, lanes 3 and 4). Reprobing the same blot with anti-PBGD antiserum showed that transfectants with pX-alad (panel B, lane 2), p6.5-pbgd (lane 3), and p6.5-pbgd + pX (lane 4) each contained a single band of the expected size,i.e. ∼36 or ∼42 kDa, respectively, whereas those with both genes (lane 5) contained both protein bands. The results thus indicate that both genes are expressed at the protein level individually in different transfectants and simultaneously in the same one using different vectors. Both ALAD and PBGD activities are absent in wild type cells (data not shown) and present only in transfectants with the genes of relevance (Table II). The specific activities in pmol products/mg protein/h fall within the range of ∼2500 to ∼9500 and ∼400 to ∼1400 for ALAD and PBGD, respectively. The variations in the specific activities among different experiments seen may be accounted for by differences introduced inadvertently in the culture and selective conditions used. Clearly, both enzymes are fully functional alone or in combination in the transgenic Leishmania cells.Table IIALAD- and PBGD-specific activities in Leishmania transfectantsALAD activityPBGD activityExpt.

Open table in a new tab Whereas both ALAD and PBGD were expressed and fully active in Leishmania transfected with the respective gene, the transfectants produced no detectable porphyrins (see Figs.3, lanes 3 and 6, and 4, panel N, 0 μm ALA) unless ALA was provided to those with both transgenes (Figs. 3, lanes 2 and 5, and 4,panel N, 125–1000 μm ALA). However, this porphyric Leishmania along with all other transfectants resembled nontransfected wild type cells in that they grew continuously only in the defined medium supplemented with either hemin or protoporphyrin IX (data not shown). Deletion of the heme compound from this medium resulted in the eventual cessation of their growth in all cases after several passages. Heme biosynthesis pathway thus remains incomplete in these transgenicLeishmania clearly because of additional enzymatic defect(s) downstream of PBGD.Figure 4Cellular localization and ALA dose-dependent release of porphyrin from porphyric L. amazonensis. Panels A–L, cells transfected with p6.5-pbgd/pX-alad and p6.5-pbgd/pX were examined by confocal microscopy for the presence of cellular porphyrins after exposure to 1 mm ALA for 2 days. See “Experimental Procedures” for the settings used for differential interference (DIC) (panels A, D,G, and J), porphyrin fluorescence (Porphyrin) (panels B, E,H, and K), and merged images of DIC and porphyrin (Merged) (panels C, F, I, and L). Panels A–F, cells transfected with the control P6.5-pbgd/pX; panels G–L, cells transfected with P6.5-pbgd/pX-alad. Note that the porphyrin signals diffused in the cytosol and localized more intensely to cytoplasmic vacuoles (panels H, I,K, and L) in some cells and in the cytosol as a diffused pattern (panel I) in others. Panels Mand N, transfectants with P6.5-pbgd/pX-alad (PBGD+ ALAD) and the control with P6.5-pbgd/pX (PBGD only) were exposed to 0–1 mm ALA for 4 days. The cultures in 200 μl aliquots were centrifuged to sediment cells for photography with (panel N) and without (panel M) long wave UV illumination. Note: porphyrin fluorescence appears only in the spent medium of PBGD+ALAD increasing with ALA concentrations (125–1000 μm) but not in the controls, i.e. cells with PBGD alone, PBGD+ALAD cells without ALA induction (panel N), and in the absence of UV illumination (panel M).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This finding was originally suggested by the fluorescence emission spectra of porphyrins extracted from porphyricLeishmania observed (data not shown) and confirmed by thin-layer chromatography analysis of these samples (Fig. 3). Thin-layer chromatography of porphyrins extracted by standard procedures from porphyric Leishmania and their spent medium revealed only a single UV-fluorescent species (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 5), which co-migrated with uroporphyrin I octamethyl esters (lanes 1, 4, and7). This finding indicates that only uroporphyrin I was produced by these cells. No porphyrin bands were visible in samples prepared simultaneously from controls, e.g. transfectants with one or the other gene and their culture supernatants (Fig. 3,lanes 3 and 6). The cells used for sample extraction were grown in porphyrin-free defined medium, eliminating the possibility that the porphyrin species detected may have derived from an exogenous source. The porphyrins emerged only in the double transfectants after the addition of ALA into their culture media. Porphyrin-specific signals were followed by epifluorescent microscopy and imaged by confocal fluorescent microcopy (see “Experimental Procedures” for the settings used). By differential interference contrast microscopy, living cells under all conditions used appeared granulated with anterior flagella (Fig. 4,panels A, D, G, and J). Under the settings for confocal microscopy used for porphyrin, fluorescence signals emerged only in the double transfectants (Fig. 4,panels H and K) but not in the control cells,e.g. the single transfectants with pbgd alone (panels B and E). When the two sets of images from the same preparations were merged, porphyrin fluorescent signals appeared to be diffused in the cytosol (Fig. 4, panel I) as well as localized in cytoplasmic vacuoles (panels I andL). Porphyric Leishmania released uroporphyrin I into the medium, independent of cytolysis. This was demonstrated under two different conditions to generate modest and high levels of uroporphyria. Cells were handled gently to avoid inadvertent cytolysis. The kinetics of uroporphyrin accumulation in and release from porphyric Leishmania was quantitatively assessed fluorometrically. Initially used were cells grown in a chemically defined medium with a modest selective pressure of 2 μg of tunicamycin and 10 μg of G418/ml in conjunction with increasing but low concentrations of ALA from 0 to 200 μm (Fig. 5). Under all these conditions, cells grew from 2.5 × 106 to ∼107/ml in a period of 3 days (Fig. 5, left panels), except the one with the highest ALA concentration of 200 μm in which case the cell density decreased on day 3 (Fig. 5, bottom left panel). In the absence of ALA, porphyrin was detected neither in cells nor in their spent media throughout the period of cell growth (Fig. 5,top middle and right panels). In the presence of ALA, the cells produced uroporphyrin in an ALA dose-dependent manner, namely an increase from ∼3 to ∼8 pmol uroporphyrin/106 cells in the presence of 25 to 200 μm ALA during the first day (Fig. 5, middle panels). The cellular levels of uroporphyrin declined in these cells from days 2 to 3, concomitant with its release also in an ALA dose-dependent manner from 5 to 28 pmol uroporphyrin/ml in the culture medium (Fig. 5, right panels). In a separate set of experiments, cells were grown in Medium199 plus heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum under the optimal conditions for uroporphyria, i.e. a 10-fold increase of the selective pressure (20 μg of tunicamycin and 100 μg of G418/ml) and a 5- to 8-fold increase of the substrate (up to 1.0–1.6 mm ALA provided exogenously). Under these conditions, both cellular and released uroporphyrin levels were considerably enhanced (Fig. 4,panels N, 125–1000 μ m ALA), the latter reaching a level as much as ∼2 μm. Cytolysis was observed in <1% of these cells that did not account for the level of porphyrin release seen. The results from both sets of the experiments indicate that uroporphyria is induced in an ALA dose-dependent fashion, which is marked by initial cellular accumulation of uroporphyrin followed by its release and accumulation in the culture medium. PorphyricLeishmania remained motile and thus viable under all culture and selective conditions used, except when they were subjected to UV irradiation. This sensitivity was indicated by the immediate cessation of the motility of the early porphyric cells after exposure to illumination under the setting for epifluorescent microscopy or with the long wave UV lamp. Late porphyric cells exposed to ALA 2 days or longer were less sensitive, whereas nonporphyric cells were totally insensitive to UV irradiation under these conditions as indicated by their motility. The monocytic tumor cells, J774A1, were also rendered sensitive to long wave UV irradiation after infection with porphyricLeishmania. Used for these experiments were double transfectants with both alad and pbgd and single transfectants with only pbgd grown under the same conditions. Uroporphyria was generated only in the double transfectants. The results (Fig. 6) showed that UV irradiation lysed only the macrophages infected with porphyric Leishmania and that the cytolysis was proportional to the porphyric levels of the latter modulated by prior exposure to different ALA concentrations (Fig. 6, PBGD/ALAD). The nonporphyricLeishmania produced no such effect (Fig. 6, PBGD) regardless of their exposure to ALA and UV irradiation under the same conditions. There was also no cytolysis of the tumor cells when irradiated immediately after mixing them with the porphyricLeishmania or in the presence of their spent media containing uroporphyrin I. The results obtained from these experiments were similar to the control in Fig. 6 (data not shown). In this study, both alad and pbgd from mammalian sources were successfully expressed in Leishmaniaby transfection (Fig. 1), yielding products of expected size (Fig. 2) with enzymatic activities (Table II). Significantly, the episomal transgenes in two different vectors can be selected appropriately to co-express both enzymes with activities. These activities are at least 10 times higher than those normally found in the mammalian cells,e.g. macrophages (3.Chang C.S. Chang K.-P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and more comparable to those in murine Friend virus-transformed leukemia cells induced for erythroid differentiation with a heightened level of heme biosynthesis (23.Sassa S.

Genetic evidence from Drosophilahas shown that spalt (sal) can alter gene expression in a cell autonomous fashion, but Sal proteins have never been directly analyzed for their ability to activate or repress transcription.

When fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain, Sall1 represses transcription of a luciferase reporter by over 100-fold. Expression of the N terminus alone is sufficient for dose-responsive repression that, as shown by deletion analysis, requires the extreme N-terminal amino acids of the protein. The N terminus of Sall1 can repress at both short and long range relative to the promoter, and treatment with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, trichostatin A, alleviates repression by 3-fold. The same regions of the protein that are required for repression physically interact with components of chromatin remodeling complexes, HDAC1, HDAC2, RbAp46/48, MTA-1, and MTA-2. Finally, we demonstrate that Sall1 is localized to discrete nuclear foci and this localization depends on the N-terminal repression domain.

Together, these results suggest that the N terminus of mouse Sall1 can recruit HDAC complexes to mediate transcriptional repression. The transcriptional regulators of the spalt(sal) gene family play an important role in regulating developmental processes of many organisms. The most well studiedsal family members, Drosophila spalt-major(salm) and spalt-related(salr), specify cell fate decisions of chordontonal precursors in the peripheral nervous system (1.Elstob P.R. Brodu V. Gould A.P. Development. 2001; 128: 723-732PubMed Google Scholar), regulate tracheal development (2.Boube M. Llimargas M. Casanova J. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), control terminal differentiation of photoreceptors (3.Mollereau B. Dominguez M. Webel R. Colley N.J. Keung B. de Celis J.F. Desplan C. Nature. 2001; 412: 911-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and determine proper placement of wing veins (4.de Celis J.F. Barrio R. Kafatos F.C. Nature. 1996; 381: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Mutations in the human sal ortholog, SALL1, cause an autosomal dominant disorder, Townes-Brocks Syndrome, and result in ear, limb, anal, renal, and heart anomalies (5.Kohlhase J. Wischermann A. Reichenbach H. Froster U. Engel W. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Targeted deletion of mouse Sall1 results in severe renal dysplasia or complete agenesis, indicating that Sall1 has an essential role in kidney development (6.Nishinakamura R. Matsumoto Y. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Sato A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Scully S. Lacey D.L. Katsuki M. Asashima M. Yokota T. Development. 2001; 128: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sal proteins are postulated to be transcriptional regulators because their sequence contains multiple DNA-binding zinc finger motifs. Mouse Sall1 has 10 zinc fingers (Fig. 1 A). Nine are the C2H2-type (shaded gray) and are arranged as doublets with a third finger associated with the second pair. The second finger of each pair contains the conserved sequence F(T/S)TKGNLK that has been termed the SAL-box (7.Kuhnlein R.P. Frommer G. Friedrich M. Gonzalez-Gaitan M. Weber A. Wagner-Bernholz J.F. Gehring W.J. Jackle H. Schuh R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 168-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This sequence is located in the predicted α-helical region of the zinc finger that specifies the nucleotide consensus binding sequence and is thought to bind A/T-rich sequences (8.Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1053-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 9.Barrio R. Shea M.J. Carulli J. Lipkow K. Gaul U. Frommer G. Schuh R.J.H. Kafatos F.C. Dev. Genes Evol. 1996; 206: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the native DNA-binding site and direct target genes regulated by Sal proteins have not yet been determined. The most N-terminal zinc finger is of the C2HC-type (solid gray) and may mediate protein-protein interactions rather than DNA binding (reviewed in Ref.10.Laity J.H. Lee B.M. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Sal proteins may act as transcriptional repressors in a variety of developmental contexts in Drosophila. sal inhibits expression of trachealess(trh), ventral veinless (vvl), andknirps (kni) in the developing trachea (2.Boube M. Llimargas M. Casanova J. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar),rhodopsin 1 (rh1) in differentiating photoreceptors (3.Mollereau B. Dominguez M. Webel R. Colley N.J. Keung B. de Celis J.F. Desplan C. Nature. 2001; 412: 911-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and iriquois (iro) andkni during development of the longitudinal veins (11.de Celis J.F. Barrio R. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These genetic experiments also indicate that sal-mediated repression is cell autonomous, raising the possibility that Sal may directly inhibit expression of these downsteam targets inDrosophila. Despite this considerable genetic evidence supporting a role for sal family members in the regulation of gene expression, there is currently no evidence that Sal proteins can directly mediate transcriptional repression. Here we test whether mouse Sall1 is capable of directly affecting transcriptional activity and provide the first direct evidence that Sal proteins may act as transcriptional repressors. When linked to a heterologous DNA-binding domain, the Sall1 protein is capable of repressing transcription over 100-fold. We localize repressor activity within the N terminus of the protein and suggest that histone modification by HDACs 1The abbreviations used are: HDAChistone deacetylaseTSAtrichostatin AGAL4DBGAL4 DNA-binding domainGSTglutathione S-transferaseAdMLPadenovirus major late promoter is involved in repression by Sall1. The dependence of Sall1-mediated repression on histone deacetylation is further confirmed by demonstrating a physical association between HDAC complex components and the N-terminal Sall1 repression domain. In addition, the ability of Sall1 to repress transcription correlates with localization of Sall1 in focal nuclear subdomains that may be involved in recruiting Sall1 to specific HDAC complexes within the nucleus. histone deacetylase trichostatin A GAL4 DNA-binding domain glutathione S-transferase adenovirus major late promoter Mouse Sall1 cDNA was isolated by screening a mouse 129/SvJ kidney cDNA library with aSall1 EST clone (GenBank™ accession numberAA117993) by Incyte Genomics. Sequencing of the largest cDNA clone (5.4 kb) showed that this clone encoded all but the initial ATG and 386 bases of the coding region of the mouse ortholog of humanSALL1. The remaining 5′-sequence was obtained by performing 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends on E17 RNA from mouse kidney using the 5′/3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The full cDNA clone was reconstructed by PCR amplification using Sall1-specific primers designed from the subsequently published mouse Sall1 sequence (Ref. 12.Buck A. Archangelo L. Dixkens C. Kohlhase J. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2000; 89: 150-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, GenBank™ accession number AJ271914) and an internalKpnI site. COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well and transfected using FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's directions. The GAL4DB expression plasmid, BXG-I, and the eukaryotic GST fusion plasmid, pEBG, were graciously provided by R. Maas (Brigham and Women's Hospital) and S. Stefani (McGill University) and used to construct the GAL4DB-Sall1 and GST-Sall1 fusions by PCR and restriction fragment subcloning. The following Sall1 fusion constructs were confirmed by sequencing and detection of the expressed fusion proteins by anti-GAL4DB or anti-GST Western blotting: full-length (amino acids 1–1322), N-terminal (2–435), C-terminal (1104–1322), Zn-finger (436–1103), and the N-terminal deletion constructs encoding amino acids 77–435, 130–435, 204–435, 266–435, and 399–435. The luciferase reporters were generous gifts from J. Milbrandt (SV40Luc, pG5SV40Luc, pG5–450bp-SV40Luc, pG5–2900bp-SV40Luc, and pG5AdMLPLuc, Washington University), R. Davis (pG5E1bLuc, University of Massachusetts), and D. Moore (GAL4tkLuc, Baylor). MTA1-T7 and MTA2-FLAG (PCIN4) were provided by R. Kumar (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center) and W. Gu (Columbia University), respectively. The Sall1-FLAG constructs were made using a p300-FLAG-pcDNA3 plasmid obtained from J. Merchant (University of Michigan) by removing p300 and replacing it with the full-length Sall1 sequence. The FLAG-tagged N-terminal deletion constructs Sall1-(77–1322), Sall1-(130–1322), Sall1-(204–1322) were generated by excising a 5′-fragment of Sall1-FLAG with HindIII (5′ end of cDNA) andNheI (nucleotide 913) and replacing it with aHindIII-NheI cut PCR fragment. These constructs encode a full-length protein beginning with nucleotide 77, nucleotide 130, or nucleotide 204 and are FLAG-tagged at their C termini. Cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of GAL4DB fusion plasmid, 2 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid, and 0.05 μg of cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase control plasmid per well. pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was used to normalize the DNA content of the transfection. When appropriate, cells were treated with 200 nm trichostatin (TSA, Calbiochem) or an equivalent volume of Me2SO vehicle for 24 h prior to harvesting for reporter assays. After 48 h, the transfected cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with reporter assay lysis buffer (Promega), and spun at 10,000 × g to pellet cell debris. The supernatant was then assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity using the manufacturer's suggested protocols (luciferase, BD PharMingen; β-galactosidase, PE Biosystems) with 15 or 2.5% of the total lysate, respectively. Luminescent reporter activity was measured using a Monolight Luminometer (BD PharMingen). All transfections were normalized to β-galactosidase activity and performed in triplicate. Statistical significance of TSA-versus Me2SO-treated samples was determined by one-tailed Student's t test. Transfected cells were allowed to express GST-Sall1 fusion proteins for 48–72 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed for 1 h on ice with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 200 mm sucrose, 50 mmTris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 24 μg/ml Pefabloc, 20 mm NaF, and 2 mm sodium molybdate)). Cells were scraped off the dishes and the cell suspension was sonicated (3 × 20 s). After removal of particulate cell debris by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, GST-Sall1 fusion protein complexes were isolated by precipitation of 50 μg of total protein (or 200 μg for the full-length GST fusion) with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Bioscience) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 10 volumes of lysis buffer and eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. GST-Sall1 fusions and Sall1-interacting proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 7.5% gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked in 3% nonfat dry milk, and incubated with appropriate antibodies. Antibody reactivity was detected using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase anti-mouse (KPL) and horseradish peroxidase anti-rabbit (Sigma)) and ECL detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were transfected on glass coverslips and allowed to express for 48–72 h. The coverslips were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 mm glycine, permeablized in cold methanol, and blocked in 10% normal goat serum (Sigma). Primary antibodies were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin (anti-FLAG 1:200, anti-GAL4DB 1:50, and anti-Sall1 1:500) and detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-mouse (ICN) secondary antibodies. All coverslips were incubated with 100 ng/ml Hoechst dye to detect cell nuclei and mounted with Miowiol 4–88 (Polysciences, Inc.). Images were visualized with a fluorescence (Nikon Eclipse E800) or confocal (MRC1024 Bio-Rad) microscope. Greater than 200 cells from at least 3 independent transfections were scored for each pattern of nuclear staining (punctate, reticular, diffuse, see text). Polyclonal antisera were raised against an N-terminal peptide of mouse Sall1, RRDGDTEKGQPSRPTKS (Strategic Biosolutions). Anti-GAL4DB (RK5C1), anti-GST (B14), anti-HDAC2 (H-54), and anti-Sin3A (AK-11) (Santa Cruz); anti-FLAG (M2) and anti-HDAC1 (Sigma); anti-T7 (Novagen); and anti-RbAp46/48 (15G12) (Genetex) were all obtained from commercial sources. The ability of mouse Sall1 to affect transcription was analyzed by fusing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4DB) to mouse Sall1. As depicted in Fig. 1 A, the full-length protein (1–1322), a N-terminal construct containing the C2HC zinc finger (2–435), a C-terminal region containing one double zinc finger pair (1104–1322), and a zinc finger domain containing seven C2H2 zinc fingers (436–1103) were expressed as GAL4DB fusion proteins and transfected with a GAL4-responsive luciferase reporter. When assayed for its ability to activate or repress a GAL4-responsive reporter, full-length mouse Sall1 was a very strong transcriptional repressor (>100-fold). This repression activity appears to be largely mediated by the N-terminal domain because it alone is capable of potent repression. The C-terminal domain does not have the ability to repress or activate transcription and the zinc finger domain containing the remaining seven C2H2 zinc fingers represses transcription to a lesser extent. DNA binding is required for Sall1 repression because expression of full-length Sall1 that lacks the GAL4 DNA-binding domain does not repress transcription (data not shown). Because the N terminus alone was shown to be a particularly powerful repressor, it was analyzed in more detail to determine whether transcriptional repression was dependent on Sall1 dosage. Increasing amounts of the GAL4DB-Sall1-N fusion construct were transfected into cells to test for their ability to repress luciferase expression. Increasing doses of Sall1-N repressed luciferase activity in a dose-responsive manner (Fig. 1 B). At the lowest amount of Sall1-N transfected (10 ng), the luciferase activity was identical to the activity produced by GAL4DB alone while at the highest amount of Sall1-N transfected (1 μg), the luciferase activity measured was less than 3% of the GAL4DB control. The Sall1 N terminus was capable of repressing transcription from two additional GAL4-responsive reporters containing the adenovirus E1b promoter or the thymidine kinase promoter and in two different cell lines (data not shown). To localize the repression domain within the N terminus, a series of Sall1-N deletion constructs were coexpressed with the GAL4-responsive SV40-luciferase reporter. As depicted in Fig. 2, these deletion constructs sequentially removed the C2HC zinc finger and regions rich in threonine, glutamine, and serine. Interestingly, removal of the extreme N-terminal 76 amino acids including the C2HC zinc finger, Sall1-N-(77–435), significantly reduced the ability to repress transcription from over 100-fold to only 10-fold. A further deletion of the first 129 amino acids, Sall1-N-(130–435), removes all of the repression activity of the Sall1 N terminus and none of the smaller constructs regained this ability to repress transcription. Our assay was able to detect both transcriptional activation and repression because the GAL4 transactivation domain consistently increased luciferase activity more than 10-fold (data not shown). Yet, despite the resemblance between the glutamine-rich region of Sall1 and the activator domain of the transcription factor Sp1 (7.Kuhnlein R.P. Frommer G. Friedrich M. Gonzalez-Gaitan M. Weber A. Wagner-Bernholz J.F. Gehring W.J. Jackle H. Schuh R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 168-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), none of the Sall1 N-terminal constructs unmasked a region capable of activating transcription. To determine whether repression was dependent on the distance of the binding sites from the promoter region, Sall1-N was targeted to GAL4-binding sites at different distances from the SV40 promoter. The SV40 reporter used in the previous experiments contained five GAL4-binding sites separated from the SV40 promoter by 50 bp. This reporter, two additional constructs that included intervening sequences of 450 and 2900 bp between the GAL4-binding sites and the SV40 promoter, and a control plasmid that removed all of the GAL4-binding sites upstream of the SV40 promoter were tested for repression by co-transfection with Sall1-N. As shown in Fig. 3 A, all of the reporters containing GAL4-binding sites (50, 450, and 2900 bp) were repressed by Sall1-N to less than 3% of GAL4DB-transfected control (gray bar) regardless of the length of the intervening sequence. This repression was significantly different (p < 0.05) from Sall1-N repression of a luciferase reporter with no GAL4-binding sites (SV40, 25%) and the activity of the GAL4DB control was identical using each of the three reporters (data not shown). Thus, Sall1-N is able to repress transcription both close to and at a distance from the promoter. Repression of transcription by many proteins close to and at a distance from a promoter region has been shown to involve HDAC activity, therefore we tested whether Sall1-N repression required HDAC activity using the HDAC inhibitor, TSA. Because TSA had a repressive effect on the baseline activity of the SV40 reporter in the absence of Sall1, we utilized a GAL4-responsive luciferase reporter driven by a different promoter for these assays. The adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP) is a well characterized promoter that is sensitive to repression by HDACs and was not repressed by TSA in the absence of Sall1 (13.Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 14.Laherty C.D. Yang W.M. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N.

Cell. 1997; 89: 341-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Similar to the SV40-luciferase reporter, transfection of Sall1-N fused to GAL4DB (Fig. 3 B,black bar) repressed the activity of the AdMLP luciferase reporter to 8% of GAL4DB-transfected controls (gray bar). TSA treatment (stippled bars) increased this activity to over 24% of GAL4-DB TSA-treated controls (p < 0.05). This 3-fold relief of repression by an HDAC inhibitor suggests that Sall1-N repression is, at least in part, HDAC dependent. HDAC-dependent repression utilizes multiprotein complexes. Therefore we next tested whether Sall1 could physically interact with HDAC complex components. Two well characterized HDAC-containing complexes, NuRD and Sin3, have been shown to interact with sequence specific DNA-binding transcription factors, such as Ikaros (16.Kim J. Sif S. Jones B. Jackson A. Koipally J. Heller E. Winandy S. Viel A. Sawyer A. Ikeda T. Kingston R. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) and nuclear hormone receptors (reviewed in Ref. 17.Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar), and thereby mediate transcriptional repression. Two HDAC enzymes, HDAC1 and HDAC2, and two associated proteins, RbAp46 and RbAp48, are core components common to both the NuRD and Sin3 repression complexes. NuRD and Sin3 differ by the inclusion of NuRD-specific (MTA1, MTA2, Mi2, and MBD3) and Sin3-specific (Sin3A, SAP18, and SAP30) factors to alter chromatin structure and repress transcription via distinct DNA-binding transcription factors (reviewed in Ref. 18.Ahringer J. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 351-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). To test for a physical interaction between Sall1 and HDAC complexes, the same regions of Sall1 that were expressed as GAL4DB fusion proteins were subcloned into a GST fusion expression vector, pEBG, and overexpressed in COS-1 cells. GST-Sall1 fusion proteins were isolated on glutathione-Sepharose beads and analyzed by Western blotting. All GST-Sall1 proteins were expressed at similar levels except for the largest fusion, full-length Sall1, which was at least 4-fold less well expressed (data not shown) and required 4-fold more of the cell lysate to be used in the precipitation (see “Experimental Procedures”). When the GST-Sall1 precipitates were analyzed for the ability to directly or indirectly bind HDAC repression complex proteins, the same regions of Sall1 that mediated strong repression, the full-length protein (1–1322) and the N terminus (2–435), interacted with repression components (Fig. 4 A). Endogenous HDAC1, HDAC2, and RbAp46/48, core components of all HDAC repression complexes, bound to N-terminal and full-length GST fusion proteins, but not to the C-terminal or zinc finger proteins or to GST alone. To discern whether Sall1 interacted with the Sin3 or NuRD repression complex, we next tested whether these GST-Sall1 proteins could bind to Sin3A or to the NuRD-specific components, MTA1 and MTA2. MTA1-T7 and MTA2-FLAG were coexpressed with GST-Sall1 fusions and, like HDAC1/2 and RbAp46/48, were able to bind full-length and N-terminal Sall1 fusion proteins, but not the C-terminal or zinc finger regions. Interestingly, another NuRD complex component, Mi2, was not detectable in the GST-Sall1 precipitates (data not shown), suggesting that not all NuRD components were present in the active Sall1 repression complex. However, since Sin3A does not bind any GST-Sall1 fusion proteins, the active Sall1 repressor complex likely resembles NuRD and not Sin3. The correlation between strong transcriptional repression and NuRD complex interaction was evident for the N-terminal deletions of Sall1 (Fig. 4 B). When the N terminus and the three longest deletion constructs (77–435, 130–435, and 204–435) were expressed as GST fusion proteins in COS-1 cells and purified on glutathione-Sepharose, only Sall1-N was able to interact with HDAC1, HDAC2, RbAp46/48, MTA1-T7, and MTA2-FLAG. Since this region was also capable of the most potent repression, this suggests that the first 76 amino acids of Sall1 are required for repression through their interaction with components of the NuRD complex. Because transcriptional regulators have been shown to localize in discrete subdomains within the nucleus (19.Hendzel M.J. Kruhlak M.J. MacLean N.A. Boisvert F. Lever M.A. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 76: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we next examined the cellular localization of the Sall1 protein. Immunofluorescence of cells overexpressing a full-length FLAG-tagged Sall1 protein demonstrated that Sall1 is found in the nucleus in discrete punctate foci (Fig. 5 A, top panels). This pattern was evident in ∼70% of transfected cells using a monoclonal antibody that recognized the C-terminal FLAG epitope and the anti-Sall1 polyclonal antisera directed against an N-terminal peptide (data not shown) indicating that this punctate localization was easily detectable by multiple reagents. Similar punctate nuclear foci were also detected in cells expressing GAL4DB-Sall1-N (Fig. 5 A, bottom panel) demonstrating that the N-terminal domain of Sall1 was sufficient for localization to these discrete nuclear subdomains. Notably, the presence of the canonical nuclear localization sequence in GAL4DB was also required because GST-Sall1-N was not localized to the nucleus (data not shown). Thus, while the N-terminal domain of Sall1 does not appear to contain a functional nuclear localization signal, it does contain a domain that targets Sall1 to discrete nuclear foci once Sall1 has entered the nucleus. Since Sall1-N was an active repressor, bound to HDAC complexes, and was sufficient to localize Sall1 to discrete nuclear foci, we next sought to determine whether the presence of Sall1 in nuclear foci correlated with its ability to repress. In contrast to the punctate staining observed for most cells expressing Sall1-N, N-terminal deletions that significantly reduced or abolished repression by Sall1 altered the subnuclear localization. Three different patterns of Sall1 nuclear staining were observed and are represented in Fig. 5 B: punctate (top panels), reticular (middle panels), and diffuse (bottom panels). Deletion of the first 76 amino acids from the N terminus resulted in a 10-fold reduction in repression (Fig. 2) and reduced the number of cells exhibiting punctate nuclear staining (16%) compared with Sall1-N (66%, top left panel). The remainder of the Sall1-N-(77–435) expressing cells exhibited a reticular (32%, middle left panel) or diffuse (52%) nuclear staining pattern and were clearly distinct from the discrete punctate pattern. A larger N-terminal deletion that removed 129 amino acids and completely abrogated repression (Fig. 2) exhibited a predominantly diffuse nuclear pattern of staining (83%, bottom left panel). Thus, deletion of a region of the N-terminal of Sall1 that is required for transcriptional repression alters the nuclear localization of Sall1 from a predominantly punctate nuclear distribution to a diffuse or reticular pattern of nuclear staining. To confirm these results in the context of the intact Sall1 protein and its native nuclear localization sequence, the same deletion constructs that were expressed as N-terminal Sall1 GAL4DB and GST fusion proteins for the repression and interaction studies were made as FLAG-tagged proteins containing the zinc finger and C-terminal domains. Similar to the results observed with the GAL4DB N-terminal fusion proteins, Sall1-(77–1322) exhibited a punctate pattern of nuclear staining in only 18% of cells compared with 67% for full-length Sall1 (Fig. 5 B, top right panel). The remainder of the Sall1-(77–1322) expressing cells exhibited either diffuse nuclear staining (56%) or a reticular pattern of nuclear staining (26%,middle right panel). Sall1-(130–1322), the deletion analogous to the N-terminal construct that completely abrogated Sall1-mediated repression (Fig. 2), exhibited diffuse nuclear staining in the majority of expressing cells (79%, bottom right panel). Sall1-N-(204–435), a larger N-terminal deletion construct that also does not repress transcription (Fig. 2) displayed a predominantly diffuse nuclear staining pattern that was indistinguishable from Sall1-(130–1322) (data not shown). Together, these results strongly suggest that localization to discrete, punctate nuclear foci is necessary for full transcriptional repression by Sall1. In this report we provide the first direct evidence that the multi-zinc finger protein mouse Sall1 is a potent repressor of transcription. This conclusion is consistent with the genetic evidence in Drosophila that sal inhibits expression of multiple genes in a cell autonomous manner (2.Boube M. Llimargas M. Casanova J. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 3.Mollereau B. Dominguez M. Webel R. Colley N.J. Keung B. de Celis J.F. Desplan C.

The demonstration that Sall1 is a strong transcriptional repressor does not exclude the possibility that it could also function as a transcriptional activator in some contexts. In patterningDrosophila wing veins, the two sal family members, salm and salr, repress genes when they are highly expressed, but also can activate gene transcription at lower expression levels (11.de Celis J.F. Barrio R. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This study examined the ability of Sall1 to control transcription in an overexpression system and thereby highlighted a role for Sall1 in transcriptional repression. However, to date our analysis of Sall1 in vitro has not uncovered a domain that activates transcription. 2S. Kiefer and M. Rauchman, unpublished observations. The Sall1 N terminus alone is capable of strong transcriptional repression. This region contains a C2HC zinc finger and domains rich in threonine, glutamine, and serine. The C2HC zinc finger region, and not the threonine, glutamine, or serine-rich domains, is necessary for potent repression because truncation of the extreme N terminus reduces repression activity by 10-fold. The glutamine-rich domain has been postulated to mediate transcriptional activation (7.Kuhnlein R.P. Frommer G. Friedrich M. Gonzalez-Gaitan M. Weber A. Wagner-Bernholz J.F. Gehring W.J. Jackle H. Schuh R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 168-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), but this domain did not contribute to activation or repression in the experiments presented here. Within the region required for repression, all vertebrate Sal proteins contain a homologous C2HC zinc finger and a 20-amino acid region at their extreme N termini. Further studies are underway to test whether these regions are sufficient to repress transcription or whether additional regions cooperate to achieve full transcriptional repression by the N terminus of mouse Sall1. The Drosophila Sal family members do not encode a C2HC zinc finger domain and do not share any apparent homology with vertebrate Sal proteins at their N termini. However, although not investigated in detail in this report, our data also demonstrate that Sall1 contains another repression domain in a region of the protein that includes the DNA-binding C2H2 zinc fingers and this domain appears to repress independently of HDAC (Figs. 1 A and 4 A). Since the C2H2 zinc fingers are highly conserved between fly and vertebrate Sal, one possibility is thatDrosophila Sal mediates repression via this region of the protein. The N-terminal repression domain identified in this study may have been recruited later in evolution and may serve a unique function in vertebrate development. The presence of multiple independent repression domains in transcription factors, in some cases overlapping with the DNA-binding domain, has been demonstrated for other factors, such as Brinker, Hesx1, and ZEB (20.Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7961-7971Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 21.Dasen J.S. Barbera J.P. Herman T.S. Connell S.O. Olson L. Ju B. Tollkuhn J. Baek S.H. Rose D.W.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5725-5736Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the case of Brinker, the two domains employ different co-repressor molecules to mediate transcriptional repression. These domains can function independently or cooperatively to repress dpp-responsive genes (22.Hasson P. Muller B. Basler K. Paroush Z. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5725-5736Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Whether a similar paradigm applies to Sall1 remains to be established. The role of the mouse Sall1 N terminus in transcriptional repression has a potential implication for patients with human SALL1mutations. A hotspot for mutations that cause Townes-Brocks Syndrome birth defects occurs in the region before the first set of double zinc fingers (6.Nishinakamura R. Matsumoto Y. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Sato A.

Some of these mutations cause premature stop codons and, if a truncated protein were expressed from these mutated alleles, that protein would encode only the N-terminal domain. Because the region of mouse Sall1 required for repression (amino acids 1–130) are 99% identical to human SALL1, the experiments presented here suggest that this truncated protein would be an extremely powerful transcriptional repressor. The repression domain would be untethered from the DNA-binding region of SALL1 but, according to our results, could still interact with repression complexes. This unregulated repressor could be a major factor in the phenotype of Townes-Brocks Syndrome possibly by conferring dominant negative activity as a nonspecific transcriptional regulator. Because murine Sall1 can repress transcription close to and at a distance from the promoter and the HDAC-inhibitor TSA can alleviate some of the repression, HDAC complexes may mediate transcriptional inhibition by Sall1. This hypothesis is further substantiated by the fact that the same Sall1 constructs that repress, the full-length protein and the first 435 N-terminal amino acids can also interact with HDAC complex components. However, since Sall1 repression is only partially relieved by HDAC inhibitors, it is likely that deacetylase enzyme activity is augmented by other repression mechanisms to mediate strong inhibition of gene transcription in the Sall1 repressor complex. It also remains to be determined which, if any, of the HDAC complex components interact with Sall1 directly. The protein directly responsible for Sall1 association with HDAC complexes requires the first 76 amino acids of Sall1 for binding and could be HDAC itself. Regardless of the identity of the direct Sall1-binding protein(s), the strict association between strong repression and HDAC complex interaction suggests that a large multiprotein complex is responsible for Sall1 repression of target genes. Such a model is similar to that proposed for other transcription factors, such as the zinc finger protein Ikaros (16.Kim J. Sif S. Jones B. Jackson A. Koipally J. Heller E. Winandy S. Viel A. Sawyer A. Ikeda T. Kingston R. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). However, while Ikaros-containing complexes display both ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling and histone deacetylation activities, we were unable to detect the NuRD-associated DNA-dependent ATPase Mi2 in a complex with Sall1. Thus, either Sall1 does not recruit chromatin remodeling ATPase activity or alternatively it recruits a chromatin-remodeling complex independent of NuRD, such as SWI/SNF. It is also possible that Sall1 assembles a unique HDAC-containing complex related to NuRD, similar to that identified for nuclear receptors in matrix-associated deacetylase bodies (24.Downes M. Ordentlich P. Kao H.Y. Alvarez J.G. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10330-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A definitive characterization of the active Sall1 repression complex will require analysis using an endogenous target gene. The N-terminal region of Sall1 that also contains the repression domain is required for cellular localization of Sall1 in discrete, punctate nuclear foci. Transcriptional modulators are often found in this type of localization pattern and have been described as components of nuclear subdomains termed splicing factor speckles, coiled bodies, PML oncogenic domains (reviewed in Ref. 25.Lamond A.I. Earnshaw W.C. Science. 1998; 280: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar), or matrix-associated deacetylase bodies (24.Downes M. Ordentlich P. Kao H.Y. Alvarez J.G. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10330-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Localization of the transcriptional repressors Ikaros and the Kruppel-associated box-containing zinc finger proteins to heterochromatin is implicated as a mechanism of heritable gene silencing and these proteins also display a punctate nuclear staining pattern (26.Cobb B.S.

Our data strongly suggest that localization to punctate nuclear foci is important for Sall1 to function as a potent repressor. While we have determined that Sall1 does not co-localize with SC-35 (data not shown), a protein that is found in a speckled nuclear subdomain enriched for splicing factors, it remains to be determined if Sall1 foci correspond to the subdomains described for repressor complexes such as PML or matrix-associated deacetylase bodies. In summary, we provide the first evidence that mouse Sall1 is a direct transcriptional repressor. This repression is dependent, at least in part, on HDAC activity and likely involves a large multiprotein complex that includes factors associated with NuRD. The extreme N-terminal domain mediates repression and is necessary for Sall1 localization to nuclear foci that are likely essential for repressor function. It will be important to identify in vivo target genes regulated by Sall1 to determine the biochemical mechanism of Sall1 repression. During submission of this manuscript, human SALL1 was also shown to repress transcription and localize to pericentromeric heterochromatin foci by another group (Netzer, C., Rieger, L., Brero, A., Zhang, C-D., Hinzke, M., Kohlhase, J., and Bohlander, S.

These crystals are mitogenic and induce oncogene expression and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) synthesis and secretion in human fibroblasts. To date, BCP crystal-elicited signal transduction pathways have not been completely studied. Because protein kinase C (PKC) is known to play an important role in signal transduction, we investigated the participation of this pathway in the BCP crystal induction of MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA and protein expressions in human fibroblasts. Using reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Northern and Western blotting techniques, we show here that BCP crystal stimulation of MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA and protein expressions in human fibroblasts is dependent upon the calcium-dependent PKC signal transduction pathway and that the PKCα isozyme is specifically involved in the pathway. We have previously shown that BCP crystal induction of MMP-1 and MMP-3 is also dependent on the p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p44/42 MAPK) signal transduction pathway. We now show that these two pathways operate independently and seem to complement each other. This leads to our hypothesis that the two pathways initially function independently, ultimately leading to an increase in mitogenesis and MMP synthesis, and may converge downstream of PKC and p44/42 MAPK to mediate BCP crystal-induced cellular responses."

Isolation in the presence of EDTA produced only the H subunits, indicating that the latter two are formed by metalloprotease cleavage of the intact H subunit.

The MAP kinase subsequently phosphorylates and activates various transcription factors, among other substrates. In mammals, the best characterized MAPK pathways are defined by the four main classes of MAPK they activate: extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK-1 and -2), Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK-1, -2, and -3), p38 proteins (p38α, -β, -γ, and -δ), and ERK5 (4.Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4334) Google Scholar). The MAPKKK family consists of at least 14 members that include the MEKK group (MEKK1–4), the mixed lineage kinase group (MLK1–3, DLK, and LZK), the ASK proteins (ASK1 and -2), TAK1, TAO, and Tpl2/Cot. Although members within each group are highly homologous, with identity ranging between 50 and more than 90%, the homology between groups is significantly reduced and is restricted to the kinase domain. The large number of structurally diverse MAPKKKs may reflect tissue specificity or stimulus-specific signaling. Although substantial progress has been made in linking each of the known MAPKKK proteins to specific MAP kinase pathways, their precise contribution has not been clearly defined. For instance, MEKK1–3, DLK, MLK, and Tpl2 have been reported to activate preferentially JNK or ERK, rather than the p38 MAPK (5.Blank J.L. Gerwins P. Elliott E.M. Sather S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

The link between individual MAPKKKs and specific upstream control molecules has only been identified for some family members and remains to be firmly established for most. Despite our growing knowledge of the signaling elements involved in each cascade, no upstream MAPKKKs have yet been described for some MAP kinases, such as ERK3 (15.Zhu A.X. Zhao Y. Moller D.E. Flier J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8202-8211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ERK6/p38γ (16.Wang X.S. Diener K. Manthey C.L. Wang S. Rosenzweig B. Bray J. Delaney J. Cole C.N. Chan-Hui P.Y.

Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). In this system, Ste11 is the MAPKKK that activates Ste7, the MEK counterpart, which in turn activates the MAPK, Fus3 (18.Elion E.A. Grisafi P.L. Fink G.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 649-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We and others (19.Freed E. Symons M. Macdonald S.G. McCormick F. Ruggieri R.

Science. 1994; 265: 1716-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) have shown that loss of Ste11 by gene knock out can be functionally complemented in this system by an active mammalian Raf protein and its substrate MEK. In the present study we conducted a functional screen in this system to identify novel components of MAPK pathways, and we discovered a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase, designated MRK forMLK-related kinase. Here we describe the characterization of the structure of the MRKgene and the effect of the MRK protein on the known mammalian MAP kinase cascades. We found that MRK expression preferentially activated the ERK6/p38γ and JNK pathways, both in transiently transfected and stable cell lines, whereas it had a marginal effect on p38α and no significant effect on ERK. The activation of these pathways is accompanied by stimulation of their respective MKKs, in particular MKK3/MKK6 and MKK4. We also report that expression of wild type MRK induces an increase in the G2/M cell population. Conversely, γ-radiation-mediated G1 and G2arrest are decreased in cells expressing the dominant negative allele of MRK. The effect of γ-radiation is accompanied by activation of endogenous MRK. These findings suggest a role for MRK in the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we describe the identification of a human serine/threonine kinase, MRK, discovered as an activator of S. cerevisiae Ste7, the yeast MEK homolog that mediates the mating pheromone response. We also characterize MRK-β as a member of the MAPKKK family and show that MRK-β preferentially activates the ERK6/p38γ and the JNK MAP kinase pathways. In addition, we provide evidence that the MRK-β-mediated pathway is activated by γ-radiation and is necessary for the G1 and G2 arrest induced by DNA damage.We identified two splice variants of the MRK gene, as supported by the characterization of the genomic structure of the MRK locus. The gene is spread over more than 200 kb, a rather long stretch of genomic sequence. Interestingly, the MRK-β mRNA has an unusually long 5.6-kb 3′-UTR that could be involved in post-transcriptional regulation. Although rare, a long 3′-UTR has been reported for other mRNAs, such as one of the FGF-2 mRNA species (40.Prats H. Kaghad M. Prats A.C. Klagsbrun M. Lelias J.M. Liauzun P. Chalon P. Tauber J.P. Amalric F. Smith J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1836-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) where it has been implicated in modulating translation (41.Touriol C. Roussigne M. Gensac M.C. Prats H. Prats A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19361-19367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The role of this region in MRK mRNA stability or in protein expression remains to be investigated. It is also possible that the transcript length may control splicing, yielding a much less abundant mRNA encoding the alternative splice form, MRK-α. This form is, in fact, expressed at much lower levels than MRK-β in all tissues with the exception of liver, where it appears to be the major species.The MRK proteins share significant homology in the kinase domain with proteins of the MAPKKK family. The most closely related members are those in the MLK subfamily. However, the homology is restricted to the kinase domain and remains in the 50% similarity range. There is a single leucine zipper domain in the MRK proteins, whereas this is found as a double domain in the MLK family members.The functional identification and the primary sequence suggest that MRK-β is a member of the MAPKKK family. This was confirmed by its activation of specific MAP kinase pathways. Although activation of the three major MAP kinase pathways was observed when MRK was greatly overexpressed with the respective MAP kinases in cells, we found that the effects of relatively low levels of MRK on endogenous MAP kinases were more specific. Of the pathways tested, the ERK6/p38γ and JNK cascades were predominantly activated, whereas the ERK and the p38α pathways were marginally affected. In vitro phosphorylation studies demonstrated that the effect on ERK is indirect, as shown by the inability of MRK-β to phosphorylate MEK directly. Therefore, the activation of MEK, when co-transfected with MRK in cells, is likely to be secondary to new gene expression of autocrine factors. In line with this interpretation, we did not observe any effect on the activation of endogenous ERK1 and -2 in MRK-expressing MDCK cells (Fig. 6). In contrast, the MKK proteins upstream of JNK and p38, MKK4 and MKK3/MKK6, respectively, were found to be good substrates in vitro as well as in cells. Remarkably, the activation of endogenous MKK3/MKK6 and ERK6/p38γ proteins was already obvious at a time when recombinant MRK is expressed at relatively low levels, 8 h after induction, underlining the preferential stimulation of this pathway. The activation of these stress-activated kinases did not appear to be the result of cellular stress caused by overexpression of proteins in cells, because expression of similar levels of the catalytically inactive MRK kinase did not elicit any of the responses observed with the expression of the wild type protein. This observation, therefore, supports the specificity of the MRK-induced effects.While this work was in progress, Gotoh et al. (42.Gotoh I. Adachi M. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4276-4286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) reported the isolation of two mouse clones orthologous to the MRKgenes, called MLTK. However, they reported indiscriminate activation of the ERK, JNK, p38, and ERK5 pathways. It is possible that the experimental approach used in their study, namely co-expression of the kinases with each of the potential substrates in cells, could explain the lack of discrimination observed among these signaling pathways. As discussed above, autocrine factors induced by the recombinant proteins may account for the observed effects on some of the pathways tested.Members of the p38 pathway, such as MKK3, MKK6, and ERK6/p38γ, are preferentially expressed in heart or skeletal muscle (16.Wang X.S.

It will be of interest to explore the possibility that MRK-β, via the ERK6/p38γ pathway, plays an important role in the physiology of these tissues.This work also identifies a role for MRK in the cell cycle checkpoint regulation in response to DNA damage-inducing radiation. In the MDCK cell system, the effect on the cell cycle caused by wild type MRK suggests that this kinase mediates signals leading to G2arrest. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that dominant negative MRK reduces the effects of γ-radiation on the G1and G2 phases of the cell cycle. This observation is consistent with a physiological function of MRK in the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints. These data were supported by the finding that endogenous MRK is activated by γ-irradiation shortly after treatment. How does MRK affect checkpoint regulation? The ERK6/p38γ cascade has been implicated in γ-radiation-induced cell cycle arrest (35.Wang X. McGowan C.H. Zhao M. He L. Downey J.S. Fearns C. Wang Y. Huang S. Han J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 4543-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Given the prominent activation of ERK6/p38γ by MRK, this member of the p38 family was expected to be a good candidate. Surprisingly, no activation of ERK6/p38γ was detected in response to γ-irradiation (data not shown). Therefore, at this time we cannot implicate ERK6/p38γ in the observed cell cycle effects of γ-radiation in this system. It is possible that cell type differences are responsible for this discrepancy.In conclusion, we have shown that MRK, a member of the MAPKKK family, preferentially activates the ERK6/p38γ and JNK pathways and plays a role in the regulation of DNA damage-induced checkpoints. Future studies will address the identification of the elements that relay the signals initiated by γ-radiation to MRK and those that act downstream of MRK in response to DNA damage.

It will be of interest to explore the possibility that MRK-β, via the ERK6/p38γ pathway, plays an important role in the physiology of these tissues.This work also identifies a role for MRK in the cell cycle checkpoint regulation in response to DNA damage-inducing radiation. In the MDCK cell system, the effect on the cell cycle caused by wild type MRK suggests that this kinase mediates signals leading to G2arrest. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that dominant negative MRK reduces the effects of γ-radiation on the G1and G2 phases of the cell cycle. This observation is consistent with a physiological function of MRK in the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints. These data were supported by the finding that endogenous MRK is activated by γ-irradiation shortly after treatment. How does MRK affect checkpoint regulation? The ERK6/p38γ cascade has been implicated in γ-radiation-induced cell cycle arrest (35.Wang X. McGowan C.H. Zhao M. He L. Downey J.S. Fearns C. Wang Y. Huang S. Han J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 4543-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Given the prominent activation of ERK6/p38γ by MRK, this member of the p38 family was expected to be a good candidate. Surprisingly, no activation of ERK6/p38γ was detected in response to γ-irradiation (data not shown). Therefore, at this time we cannot implicate ERK6/p38γ in the observed cell cycle effects of γ-radiation in this system. It is possible that cell type differences are responsible for this discrepancy.In conclusion, we have shown that MRK, a member of the MAPKKK family, preferentially activates the ERK6/p38γ and JNK pathways and plays a role in the regulation of DNA damage-induced checkpoints. Future studies will address the identification of the elements that relay the signals initiated by γ-radiation to MRK and those that act downstream of MRK in response to DNA damage. In this study, we describe the identification of a human serine/threonine kinase, MRK, discovered as an activator of S. cerevisiae Ste7, the yeast MEK homolog that mediates the mating pheromone response. We also characterize MRK-β as a member of the MAPKKK family and show that MRK-β preferentially activates the ERK6/p38γ and the JNK MAP kinase pathways. In addition, we provide evidence that the MRK-β-mediated pathway is activated by γ-radiation and is necessary for the G1 and G2 arrest induced by DNA damage. We identified two splice variants of the MRK gene, as supported by the characterization of the genomic structure of the MRK locus. The gene is spread over more than 200 kb, a rather long stretch of genomic sequence. Interestingly, the MRK-β mRNA has an unusually long 5.6-kb 3′-UTR that could be involved in post-transcriptional regulation. Although rare, a long 3′-UTR has been reported for other mRNAs, such as one of the FGF-2 mRNA species (40.Prats H. Kaghad M. Prats A.C. Klagsbrun M. Lelias J.M. Liauzun P. Chalon P. Tauber J.P. Amalric F. Smith J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1836-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) where it has been implicated in modulating translation (41.Touriol C. Roussigne M. Gensac M.C. Prats H. Prats A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19361-19367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The role of this region in MRK mRNA stability or in protein expression remains to be investigated. It is also possible that the transcript length may control splicing, yielding a much less abundant mRNA encoding the alternative splice form, MRK-α. This form is, in fact, expressed at much lower levels than MRK-β in all tissues with the exception of liver, where it appears to be the major species. The MRK proteins share significant homology in the kinase domain with proteins of the MAPKKK family. The most closely related members are those in the MLK subfamily. However, the homology is restricted to the kinase domain and remains in the 50% similarity range. There is a single leucine zipper domain in the MRK proteins, whereas this is found as a double domain in the MLK family members. The functional identification and the primary sequence suggest that MRK-β is a member of the MAPKKK family. This was confirmed by its activation of specific MAP kinase pathways. Although activation of the three major MAP kinase pathways was observed when MRK was greatly overexpressed with the respective MAP kinases in cells, we found that the effects of relatively low levels of MRK on endogenous MAP kinases were more specific. Of the pathways tested, the ERK6/p38γ and JNK cascades were predominantly activated, whereas the ERK and the p38α pathways were marginally affected. In vitro phosphorylation studies demonstrated that the effect on ERK is indirect, as shown by the inability of MRK-β to phosphorylate MEK directly. Therefore, the activation of MEK, when co-transfected with MRK in cells, is likely to be secondary to new gene expression of autocrine factors. In line with this interpretation, we did not observe any effect on the activation of endogenous ERK1 and -2 in MRK-expressing MDCK cells (Fig. 6). In contrast, the MKK proteins upstream of JNK and p38, MKK4 and MKK3/MKK6, respectively, were found to be good substrates in vitro as well as in cells. Remarkably, the activation of endogenous MKK3/MKK6 and ERK6/p38γ proteins was already obvious at a time when recombinant MRK is expressed at relatively low levels, 8 h after induction, underlining the preferential stimulation of this pathway. The activation of these stress-activated kinases did not appear to be the result of cellular stress caused by overexpression of proteins in cells, because expression of similar levels of the catalytically inactive MRK kinase did not elicit any of the responses observed with the expression of the wild type protein. This observation, therefore, supports the specificity of the MRK-induced effects. While this work was in progress, Gotoh et al. (42.Gotoh I. Adachi M. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4276-4286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) reported the isolation of two mouse clones orthologous to the MRKgenes, called MLTK. However, they reported indiscriminate activation of the ERK, JNK, p38, and ERK5 pathways. It is possible that the experimental approach used in their study, namely co-expression of the kinases with each of the potential substrates in cells, could explain the lack of discrimination observed among these signaling pathways. As discussed above, autocrine factors induced by the recombinant proteins may account for the observed effects on some of the pathways tested. Members of the p38 pathway, such as MKK3, MKK6, and ERK6/p38γ, are preferentially expressed in heart or skeletal muscle (16.Wang X.S. Diener K. Manthey C.L. Wang S. Rosenzweig B. Bray J. Delaney J.

Overexpression and purification of the two proteins shows that DRTase I is specific for purines with a preference for deoxyinosine (dI) > deoxyadenosine > deoxyguanosine as donor substrates whereas DRTase II has a strong preference for pyrimidines as donor substrates and purines as base acceptors. Purine analogues were substrates as acceptor bases for both enzymes.

Lactobacilli can be empirically divided into two categories depending on whether or not they require deoxyribonucleosides for growth. The Lactobacillus species having an absolute requirement for one deoxyribonucleoside, a purine, and a pyrimidine base have evolved salvage pathways to scavenge exogenous deoxyribonucleosides for their DNA synthesis. These species do not contain nucleoside phosphorylases butN-deoxyribosyltransferase and deoxyribonucleoside kinases (1.Hammer-Jespersen K. Munch-Petersen A. Metabolism of Nucleotides, Nucleosides and Nucleobases in Microorganisms. Academic Press Inc, London1983: 244-245Google Scholar). N-Deoxyribosyltransferase, also calledtrans-N-deoxyribosylase, was first discovered by McNutt (2.MacNutt W.S. Biochem.

Cardinaud R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 54: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These transfer reactions, catalyzed by either DRTase I or DRTase II, follow a ping pong bi-bi mechanism in which the cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond of a β2′-deoxyribonucleoside results in the formation of a covalent deoxyribosyl-enzyme intermediate (5.Danzin C.

The PCR reaction contained 100 pmol of each nucleotide, 100 ng of DNA template, 200 μm dNTPs, 2.5 units ofTaq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 2.5 units of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) in a volume of 100 μl. The parameters used were 1 cycle of 5 min at 95 °C, 25 cycles with three steps (30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, 3 min at 72 °C), and 1 cycle of 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was cloned into plasmid pCR2.1-T0P0 (Invitrogen), and the mixture was used to transform strain TOP10F′ (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA from several transformants was prepared and used as DNA template in a PCR reaction with oligonucleotides gua2 (5′-NNNNCCCGGGCAATATCTCGACCAGAGTGG-3′) and gua3 (5′-NNNNCCCGGGTTTGACCCTGCACTATGAATG-3′). The parameters were 1 cycle of 5 min at 95 °C, 30 cycles with three steps (30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 62 °C, 4 min at 72 °C), and 1 cycle of 10 min at 72 °C.

The PAK26 strain was obtained after transduction of the ΔguaBA deletion with a P1 stock prepared from strain PAK6. Strain PAK26 was auxotrophic for methionine, guanine, and thymidine. L. helveticus CNRZ32 DNA was prepared from an exponential phase culture. Cells were lysed in TES buffer (Tris, 50 mm (pH 8); EDTA, 10 mm (pH 8); saccharose, 250 mm) containing 20 μg/ml lysozyme and 50 units/ml mutanolysine (Sigma Chemical Co.). After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, SDS to a final concentration to 2% was added and the mixture was extracted three times with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. After precipitation, the DNA was resuspended in RNase A (500 μg/ml) containing water and partially digested with the AluI restriction enzyme.

Bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and the appropriate nucleosides and bases depending on the strain used. Cells were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min, washed once with a 100 mm phosphate buffer (NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4), pH 7.5, and resuspended in the same buffer at one-tenth of the original volume. Bacteria were disrupted by sonication, and the extracts were cleared by two successive centrifugations at 13000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysate activity was determined by incubation of different amounts of lysate in 20 mm of citrate buffer at pH 6.0 in the presence of a deoxyribonucleoside (3 mm) and a base (1 mm). The reaction was followed by applying 2-μl aliquots to a thin-layer chromatography plate for separation of substrates and products in 80% CH2Cl2/20% methanol. The R F of the different nucleosides and bases was measured after visualization under UV at 254 nm. Plates were revealed after pulverization in ethanol/p-anisaldehyde/sulfuric acid/acetic acid (90/5/5/1) and heated at 150 °C. Oligonucleotides PAK2, 5′-NGATATACATATGAAAGCAGTAGTTCCAACAGG and PAK3, 5′-NNGGATCCTTAATAGATACCGTAACCGCG; PAK9, 5′-NGATATACATATGAACAAGAAAAAGACTTTATATTTTGG and PAK10, 5′-NNGGATCCTTAATATACAGCTCCGTCGTAG were used to amplify the ptd and the ntd genes in a standard PCR reaction using plasmids pLH2 or pLH4, respectively, as DNA template. The parameters used were 1 cycle of 5 min at 95 °C; 25 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C; and 1 cycle of 10 min at 72 °C. Each PCR product was purified by using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) then digested with NdeI and BamHI enzymes (underlined in the oligonucleotide sequences) over 2 h at 37 °C and purified again with the QIAquick PCR purification kit. Each PCR product was ligated with plasmid pET24a digested with the same restriction enzymes. The ligation mixtures were used to transform strain β2033. Plasmids containing an insert of the correct size were sequenced by MWG-Biotech. Those with the correct sequence, pETLH2 and pETLH4, were used to transform strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). 500 ml of LB medium inoculated with an overnight culture of BL21(DE3)pLysS containing either pETLH2 or pETLH4 was grown under agitation at 37 °C until A 600 = 0.6. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and the cultures were incubated for 2.5 h. Bacteria were centrifuged, washed once with a 100 mm phosphate buffer (NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.5). Pellets were frozen at −20 °C. Cells were resuspended in 20 ml of phosphate buffer and broken by one passage through a French press at 14000 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 1 h, and the supernatant was precipitated by addition of solid ammonium sulfate to 55% saturation. Proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 30 min and resuspended in phosphate buffer. Each protein was further purified by filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 column previously equilibrated with 0.1 m NaCl. The elution was followed by UV absorption at 280 nm, and each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and by following the transfer activity. The most pure and active fractions were dialyzed against 100 mmcitrate, pH 6.0, buffer. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The mass spectrometry was performed by the PT3 proteomique of the Pasteur Institute. Ion spray mass spectra were recorded on an API 365 mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences-Sciex, Thornhill, Canada). Samples dissolved in water/methanol/formic acid (50/50/5) were introduced at 5 μl/min with a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, South Natick, MA). The mass spectrometer was scanned continuously from m/z 1100 to 1700 with a scan step of 0.1 and a dwell time per step of 2.0 ms, resulting in a scan duration of 16.0 s. Data were collected on a Power Macintosh 8600/200 and processed through the Biotoolbox 2.2 software from Sciex. The standard reaction mixture contained 3 μmol of the deoxyribonucleoside donor and 1 μmol of the base acceptor in 20 mm of citrate buffer, pH 6.0, and the appropriate number of enzyme units to hydrolyze 1 μmol of the deoxyribonucleoside donor per minute. Reactions were incubated at 40 °C. After 15 and 30 min, 15-μl aliquots were added to 30 μl ethanol, and the mixture was heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were then diluted with water and frozen before lyophilization The products of the reactions were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography using a reverse-phase column (100–5C18) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min and a linear gradient of 5–25% CH3CN (or 5–15% CH3CN in the case of purine exchange) in 10 mm triethylammonium acetate, pH 7.5, buffer for 20 min. A functional screen allowing selection for the production of guanine was established in E. coli. The two genes of the guaBA operon code for IMP dehydrogenase and for GMP synthetase, respectively, which govern the conversion of IMP to xanthosine 5′-phosphate and to GMP. These genes were deleted along with the genes of the deoCABD operon involved in the catabolism of nucleosides. In the resulting strain, designated PAK6, GMP can only be synthesized from guanine by the product of thegpt gene coding for the guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, because the purine nucleoside phosphorylase coded by thedeoD gene of the deoCABD operon was deleted (Fig. 1 A). The PAK6 strain is auxotrophic for guanine (G) and this requirement cannot be satisfied by deoxyguanosine (dR-G); only a residual growth was observed (Fig. 2). This could be due to the xanthosine phosphorylase (coded by xapA) activity, which, like other purine nucleoside phosphorylases, is able to carry out both phosphorolysis and synthesis of purine deoxy- and ribonucleosides (22.Hammer-Jespersen K. Buxton R.S. Hansen T.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 179: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Deoxyguanosine (dR-G) will be a source of guanine only if a N-deoxyribosyltransferase activity is expressed in strain PAK6. Because both class I and class IIN-deoxyribosyltransferase catalyze the transfer of deoxyribose between two purine bases, deoxyguanosine and adenine (A) were chosen as substrates expecting the reaction, dR-G + A ↔ dR-A + G.Figure 2Requirement of a deoxyribosyl hydrolase activity for PAK6 (ΔguaBA::gm, Δdeo-11) growth. Colonies were first isolated on glucose mineral medium supplemented with chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) and guanine (0.3 mm) and then streaked on either the same medium (A) or on glucose mineral medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), deoxyguanosine (0.3 mm), and adenine (0.3 mm) (B).

The ligation mixture was then transformed into strain PAK6. Colonies expressing a deoxyribosyltransferase activity were selected by their ability to grow on glucose mineral medium supplemented with deoxyguanosine (dR-G) and adenine. Fig. 2 illustrates the growth differences for PAK6 transformants expressing a DRTase activity (Fig. 2, A and B, parts b, c, and d) compared with the parent (part a). To distinguish the two deoxyribosyltransferase activities, plasmid DNA from different selected colonies was extracted and used to transform the thymidine and guanine auxotrophic strain PAK26. In strain PAK26, dTMP cannot be synthesized from dUMP, because the thymidylate synthase coded by thyA gene has been inactivated. In addition, thymine cannot be a source of thymidine, because the thymidine phosphorylase coded by deoA and the uridine phosphorylase coded by udp genes have been deleted (Fig. 1 B) (22.Hammer-Jespersen K. Buxton R.S. Hansen T.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 179: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Deoxyguanosine (dR-G) and thymine (T) will be sources of guanine and thymidine only if a DRTase II activity is expressed in strain PAK26 to catalyze the exchange reaction dG + T ↔ dT + G. Only colonies expressing a DRTase II activity can grow on glucose mineral medium supplemented with deoxyguanosine and thymine as sources of guanine and thymidine (Fig. 3, A and B,parts b and d). This second screening allowed the correlation of DRTase II activity with plasmid pLH2 and DRTase I with plasmid pLH4. To confirm the in vivo activities, in vitro, cell-free extracts from strains PAK6, PAK6 pLH2, and PAK6 pLH4 were prepared. As expected from the in vivo selection, extracts from strain PAK6 pLH4 could transfer the 2′-deoxyribose between guanine and adenine but not between cytosine and thymine or cytosine and adenine (Table II). This was in contrast to extracts of PAK6 pLH2 and PAK6 pLL (pLL contains theL. leichmannii ntd gene under the control of thelac promoter) clearly indicating that pLH4 codes for DRTase I. The inserts of plasmids pLH2 and pLH4 were sequenced. Plasmid pLH2 contained a 1286-bp insert. A 474-bp open reading frame (GenBank™ accession number AY064167) beginning at position 209 relative to the insertion site was identified. This open reading frame coded for a 158-amino acid polypeptide of 18,148 Da, designated NTD Lh with 83 and 81% identity with the correspondingN-deoxyribosyltransferase from L. helveticus ATCC 8018 (23.Okuyama K.

Open table in a new tab Plasmid pLH4 contained a 1465-bp insert with two open reading frames (GenBank™ accession number AY064166). The first one was incomplete but displayed 38% identity with E. coliadenosine deaminase. In particular, the His-197, Cys-245, Asp-278, and Asp-279 residues that may participate to the catalytic site of the E. coli deaminase (24.Chang Z.Y. Nygaard P. Chinault A.C. Kellems R.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2273-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) were also conserved in theL. helveticus ADD-like sequence. The second open reading frame separated by 52 bp from the first and located in the same orientation was 501 bp long and coded for a 167-amino acids polypeptide, designated PTD (for purinetrans-deoxyribosylase), with an apparent molecular mass of 18,713 Da. PTD displayed 25% identity with NTD Lh. Alignments of the four amino acid sequences with ClustalW 1.7 (Fig. 4) shows that the active site nucleophile Glu-98 is conserved in the four sequences as well as residues Asp-72 and Asn-123, however, Asp-92 and Gln-46, involved in substrate binding, are only found in three of the four sequences. This conservation suggests a similar active site for the four proteins, although structural differences must exist because pyrimidine is not a substrate for PTD. To further characterize the PTD and NTD enzymes, the two genes were amplified asNdeI-BamHI fragments and cloned into the pET24a, which has a T7 promoter inducible by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Theptd gene was expressed at a high level and purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation (Fig. 5 A, lane 2) and gel filtration (Fig. 5 A, lane 3) to homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE. By comparison, the ntd gene seemed to be expressed at a lower level. The purification was not as homogenous as for PTD, because a polypeptide of about 32 kDa was still present (Fig. 5 B). Homogeneity could be obtained after a short incubation at 65 °C, which denatured the 32-kDa polypeptide without affecting the NTD activity (data not shown). Both PTD and NTD have a similar apparent molecular mass of 24 kDa, a higher value than the deduced 18-kDa molecular mass. However their molecular mass estimated by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (18,712.91 ± 0.84 and 18,149.10 ± 1.58) was in agreement with that calculated from the sequence (18,713.18 and 18,148.57). As estimated by their elution volume during the gel filtration both proteins should be hexameric,"

C., Mostafapour, K., and Goldstein, I. J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 14996–15001). Here we describe the cloning, characterization, and expression of MOA. MOA was digested with trypsin and endoproteinase Asp-N, and the peptide fragments were purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Amino acid sequence data were obtained for eight peptides. Using oligonucleotides deduced from the peptide sequences for a reverse transcriptase-PCR, a 41-base pair cDNA was obtained. The 41-base pair fragment allowed the generation a full-length cDNA using 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends. MOA cDNA encodes a protein of 293 amino acids that contains a ricin domain. These carbohydrate binding domains were first described in subunits of bacterial toxins and are also commonly found in polysaccharide-degrading enzymes. Whereas these proteins are known to display a variety of sugar binding specificities, none to date are known to share MOA's high affinity for Galα1,3Gal and Galα1,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc. Recombinantly expressed and purified MOA retains the specificity and affinity observed with the native protein. This study provides the basis for analyzing the underlying cause for the unusual binding specificity of MOA."

To ascertain whether the TMD sequence of the substrate determines where γ-secretase cleaves and whether the region just before the TMD participates in recognition by the enzyme, we expressed chimeric human APP molecules containing either the TMD or pre-TMD regions of Notch or other transmembrane proteins. APP chimeras bearing either the Notch or the amyloid precursor-like protein-2 TMD released similar amounts of ∼4-kDa amyloid β-peptide (Aβ)-like peptides as did intact APP. Mass spectrometry revealed that the principal Aβ-like peptide ended at residue 40, indicating cleavage at the middle of the Notch TMD in the chimera. Generation of Aβ-like peptides was significantly decreased when the APP TMD was replaced by those of SREBP-1 or human epithelial growth factor receptor 3. Replacement of the APP pre-TMD region (Aβ 10–28) with that of SREBP-1 increased generation of Aβ-like peptides, while those of human epithelial growth factor receptor 3 or amyloid precursor-like protein-2 decreased it. We conclude that γ-secretase can cleave near the middle of the Notch TMD, that Aβ-like peptides may arise during Notch processing, and that the pre-TMD sequence of the substrate influences recognition or binding by the enzyme. γ-Secretase is an unusual intramembranous protease that has been reported to cleave the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) near the middle of its transmembrane domain (TMD) but cleave Notch near the cytoplasmic end of its TMD.

For example, single amino acid substitutions in the TM domain (TMD) of APP only altered the cleavage location within the TMD and did not inhibit the cleavage by γ-secretase (16.Lichtenthaler S.F. Ida N. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15396-15403Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17.Lichtenthaler S.F. Wang R. Grimm H. Uljon S.N. Masters C.L.

A serial mutation, deletion, and insertion study of the APP TMD indicated that γ-secretase cleavage specificity is primarily determined by the location of the cleavage site with respect to the membrane boundaries rather than by the specific sequence (18.Murphy M.P.

Substituting residues 38–47 or 39–56 of the Aβ domain with a TM sequence from the epidermal growth factor receptor, human epithelial growth factor receptor (HER)-3, still yielded a ∼4-kDa Aβ peptide (19.Tischer E. Cordell B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21914-21919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), reflecting loose sequence specificity in the region carboxyl-terminal to the γ-secretase cleavage. It is possible that substrate recognition and/or cleavage by γ-secretase also require sequences not immediately adjacent to the cleavage site. For example, γ-secretase cleavage was not abrogated by removing the entire region of APP following the TMD (20.Citron M. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), suggesting that the APP sequence immediately before (luminal to) the TMD might help direct cleavage specificity. Moreover, discrete amino acid substitutions 4 residues C-terminal to the Aβ42 cleavage site (but still within the TMD) were shown in recombinant and native systems to increase cleavage at residue 42 over that at residue 40, thus demonstrating effects of regions downstream of the actual cleavage site (18.Murphy M.P.

To elucidate further the structural requirements for γ-secretase recognition and cleavage of substrates such as Notch, APP, and an APP homologue, amyloid precursor-like protein (APLP)-2 (21.Slunt H.H. Thinakaran G. Von Koch C. Lo A.C.Y. Tanzi R.E. Sisodia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2637-2644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we performed domain-swapping experiments using membrane-inserted chimeric substrates rather than site-directed mutants of APP. Our results indicate that the Notch TMD within an APP milieu is a good γ-secretase substrate, as expected from studies demonstrating that Notch itself is a good γ-secretase substrate. Surprisingly, the principal cleavage site when in the context of APP is near the middle of the Notch TMD, similar to that of APP itself, rather than at the reported Notch cleavage site (22.Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar), suggesting that cleavage specificity may be influenced by surrounding sequences within the substrate. In support of this conclusion, we show that the sequence just N-terminal to the TMD plays a role in the recognition or binding of substrate by γ-secretase. Human APP695 cDNA containing the “Swedish” mutations K596N/M597L (SW-APP), which enhance β-secretase cleavage at Aβ Asp-1, was used as a template, and replacement sequences were generated by PCR (Fig. 1). The entire TMD of SW-APP695 (i.e. residues 626–648) was replaced by the TMD of APLP-2 (aa 694–716) (yielding SW-m-APLP-2), HER-3 (aa 642–664) (SW-m-HER-3), SREBP-1 (aa 488–509) (SW-m-SREBP-1), or human Notch-1 (aa 1735–1757) (SW-m-Notch). In another set of chimeras, the 19–20-aa region just N-terminal to the TMD of SW-APP695 (aa 606–625), including the α-secretase cleavage site, was replaced by the corresponding region of either APLP-2 (aa 674–693) (yielding SW-α-APLP-2), HER-3 (aa 622–641) (SW-α-HER-3), SREBP-1 (aa 469–487) (SW-α-SREBP-1), or human Notch1 (aa 1716–1734) (SW-α-Notch). The chimeric DNAs were then subcloned into PCI-neo vector (Promega). Certain point mutations within the Notch TMD (SW-m-NotchV40A, L41G, L42A, V49L, and 29G+) were generated from the SW-m-Notch chimeric cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis. The 29G+ construct contains the Notch TMD with a glycine at its N terminus, thus increasing the length of the Notch TMD by 1 residue to match precisely that of the APP TMD. The fidelity of all mutant genes was confirmed by DNA sequencing. For clarity, all Aβ or Aβ-like peptides generated from SW-APP and its various chimeras are numbered from the first N-terminal residue (Asp-1) of the Aβ peptide. Transfection of COS cells was performed according to instructions for the LipofectAMINE transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Plasmids encoding SW-APP or the chimeric DNAs (9 μg for each 10-cm dish, 3 μg for each 6-cm dish, and 1 μg for each well of a six-well plate) were introduced into COS cells. After transfection, cells were changed to fresh medium (5 ml for each 10-cm dish, 2.5 ml for each 6-cm dish, and 1.5 ml for each well of a six-well plate) and conditioned for 48–60 h for Aβ ELISA or immunoprecipitation (IP)/Western blotting (WB). The well characterized difluoroketone peptidomimetic γ-secretase inhibitor MW115 or an inactive control compound (MW124) of closely similar structure (compounds 11 and 12, respectively, in Ref. 23.Wolfe M.S.

The inhibitors were added to the COS cultures after transfection to final concentrations as noted throughout, and these were then cultured for ≤48 h. The final Me2SO percentage in the media was ≤0.2%. Polyclonal antibodies C7 to the last 20 residues of APP (4.Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J.

Monoclonal antibodies 3D6 (specific to Aβ 1–5), 266 (specific to Aβ 13–28), 2G3 (specific to Aβ 33–40), and 21F12 (specific to Aβ 30–42), used for Aβ ELISA, were kindly provided by P. Seubert and D. Schenk (Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) (26.Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R. Khan K. Gordon M. Tan H. Games D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Seubert P. McConlogue L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1550-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Aβ peptides secreted into media were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C overnight with 3D6 monoclonal antibody (1:800) and protein G plus A-agarose (Calbiochem). Immunoprecipitates were washed for 20 min at 4 °C in a lysis buffer of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor mixture (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma)) and then washed in lysis buffer containing 0.1% SDS. The samples were washed again in lysis buffer, eluted in Laemmli sample buffer, heated at 70 °C for 5 min, separated by 16% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was heated to 98 °C for 5 min in PBS, blotted with the 3D6 antibody, and detected with a Supersignal kit (Pierce) according to the instructions of the supplier. COS cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (see above) and centrifuged at maximum speed in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 2 min to remove cellular debris. The samples were mixed with Laemmli buffer, heated at 70 °C for 5 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% or 4–20% Tris-glycine or Tris-Tricine gels (Novex), transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with C7 antibody. After transfection, COS cells were allowed to recover in normal medium containing 10% serum overnight and then changed to reduced serum medium (Opti-MEM (Invitrogen)) and conditioned for 48 h. Conditioned media were collected, and Aβ-like peptides were immunoprecipitated from 1.5 ml of conditioned medium using monoclonal Aβ antibody, 3D6, and protein G plus A-agarose beads (Oncogene Science, Inc., Cambridge, MA) and analyzed using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Voyager-DE STR BioSpectrometry work station; PerSeptive Biosystems), as described (27.Wang R. Sweeney D. Gandy S.E. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31894-31902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Spectra were calibrated using bovine insulin as an internal mass calibrant. Aβ in conditioned medium was quantified by sandwich ELISA (see Fig. 1) using monoclonal 266 as capture antibody for all TMD replacements or either monoclonal antibodies 2G3 or 21F12 as capture antibody for all of the α-secretase region (pre-TM) replacements. In both cases, antibody 3D6 was used for detection (26.Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R. Khan K. Gordon M. Tan H. Games D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Seubert P. McConlogue L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1550-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase/presenilin is required for intramembranous proteolytic processing of Notch to release its cytoplasmic domain (NICD), which is then involved in crucial cell fate decisions during development in all metazoans (6.De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar, 7.Struhl G. Greenwald I. Nature. 1999; 398: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). The reported Notch cleavage site is near the C-terminal end of its TMD (22.Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar), while APP releases Aβ peptides by γ-secretase cleavages at or near the middle of its TMD, mainly after position 40 or 42 of the Aβ peptide (Fig. 1 A). To assess further the cleavage site in the Notch TMD and whether the Notch TMD gives rise to Aβ-like peptides, chimeric SW-APP expression constructs containing the wild-type human Notch TMD were made (Fig. 1 B), either without or with certain point mutations (see below) and then transiently expressed in COS cells. SW-APP was chosen, because this isoform undergoes increased β-secretase cleavage, yielding more C99 as a substrate for γ-secretase and thus substantially enhancing the detection of any Aβ peptides generated (28.Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). Conditioned media were collected, immunoprecipitated with an N-terminal specific Aβ antibody (3D6), and Western blotted with the same antibody, which recognizes Aβ 1–5, an epitope not altered by the mutants created in this study. We replaced the 24-residue TMD of SW-APP with the 23-residue Notch TMD, unless indicated otherwise. SW-APP and chimeric SW-APP containing either wild-type (SW-m-Notch) or mutant (SW-m-NotchV40A, L41G, L42A, V49L, and 29G+) Notch TMDs were all cleaved, and the resultant Aβ-like peptides were secreted into the media and detected by IP/WB using the Aβ N-terminal antibody, 3D6 (Fig. 2, A and B). The amounts of Aβ-like peptides generated from the various chimeras differed modestly, as determined by a sensitive sandwich ELISA using antibodies 266 (against Aβ 13–28) and 3D6 (against Aβ 1–5) (Fig. 2 C). The immunoreactive epitopes of these Aβ-like peptides are outside of the APP segments that had been replaced. A mutation in the Notch TMD reported to inhibit Notch cleavage markedly (i.e. Val49 to Leu (SW-m-NotchV49L) (22.Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 29.Huppert S.S. Le A. Schroeler E.H. Mumm J.S. Saxena M.T. Milner L.A. Kopan R. Nature. 2000; 405: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) did not prevent cleavage by γ-secretase. The amounts of Aβ-like peptides released from SW-m-Notch- and SW-m-NotchV49L-transfected cells were about the same and only modestly (but statistically significantly) lower than those from SW-APP (Fig. 2 C). By Aβ ELISA, the amount of Aβ-like peptides secreted from SW-m-Notch transfected cells (1068 ± 125 pg/ml) was about 70% of that from the SW-APP transfectants (1565 ± 148 pg/ml) (n = 17,p < 0.05). The apparent sizes of the derived Aβ-like peptides were all closely similar, migrating at ∼4 kDa by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2, A and B). These results suggest that the Notch TMD, placed within the context of APP, can be cleaved at or near the middle of the TMD, like wild-type SW-APP. Inserting certain point mutations within the Notch TMD or increasing its length by one residue (29G+) changed the cleavage efficiency of the chimeras but not the apparent size of the Aβ-like product on SDS gels (Fig. 2 B). For example, the V40A and L42A mutants (near the middle of the TMD in SW-m-Notch) led to release of more Aβ-like peptides than occurred from SW-m-Notch itself (Fig. 2 B), while total APP levels and the amount of C99 were not changed significantly (Fig. 2 D). When the first residue (Gly) of the 24-residue APP TMD was followed by the 23-residue Notch TMD, yielding a chimera (APP-m-NotchG+) with a TMD of the same length as SW-APP (Fig. 2 A), Aβ-like peptide secretion was about 64% of SW-m-Notch itself (n = 5, p < 0.05) (Fig. 2 C). To determine the exact cleavage sites of the SW-m-Notch chimeric protein by γ-secretase, Aβ-like peptides secreted from COS transfectants expressing SW-APP, SW-m-Notch, or SW-m-NotchV49G were collected by IP and analyzed by mass spectrometry (27.Wang R. Sweeney D. Gandy S.E. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31894-31902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The Aβ N-terminal specific monoclonal antibody, 3D6, was used to immunoprecipitate Aβ-like peptides (see “Materials and Methods”). The molecular masses of various Aβ-like peptides were measured by using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer. These masses were then used to identify the Aβ-like peptides produced from each chimera (Fig. 3). The relative peak intensity was used to determine the relative abundance of Aβ-like peptides. All Aβ-like peptides are numbered from the first N-terminal residue (Asp-1), known to result from β-secretase cleavage of the SW-APP molecule (30.Citron M. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Teplow D.B. Miller C. Schenk D. Johnston J. Winblad B. Venizelos N. Lannfelt L. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11993-11997Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The mass spectra of Aβ peptides produced from SW-APP showed that Aβ1–40 was the major Aβ species, as expected, and that minor species included 1–38 > 1–37 > 1–39 = 1–42 > 1–34 = 1–33, as ranked by relative peak intensity (Fig. 3 B). The mass spectral patterns of the Aβ-like peptides released from SW-m-Notch- and SW-m-NotchV49G-transfected cells were very similar (Fig. 3, C and D). The major Aβ-like peptide species was again 1–40, closely followed by 1–39, 1–38, 1–28, 1–32, and 1–37 in that order of intensity. Unlike with SW-APP, we detected no species corresponding to Aβ1–42 in the conditioned media of SW-m-Notch and SW-m-NotchV49G transfectants (Fig. 3). The Val to Gly mutation near the C terminus of the Notch TMD did not prevent the cleavage, despite the reported observation that this mutation prevents the cleavage of Notch that generates the NICD (29.Huppert S.S. Le A. Schroeler E.H. Mumm J.S. Saxena M.T. Milner L.A. Kopan R. Nature. 2000; 405: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The major cleavage site determined by mass spectrometry occurred just C-terminal to residue 40, the same as that seen for SW-APP. However, the relative amounts of the minor γ-secretase cleavages seen in SW-APP and its Notch TMD chimera were somewhat different; the ratio of major to minor peaks was reduced, Aβ 1–39 was the second most common cleavage site, and there was some cleavage at 1–28. These results indicate that the sequence specificity of the cleavage in the SW-m-Notch TMD is subtly altered, although the main cleavage still occurs at or near the middle of the TMD. We performed experiments with a γ-secretase inhibitor to determine whether the cleavages of APP and APP-Notch chimeras share a similar pharmacological profile. After transfection with SW-APP or SW-m-Notch cDNAs, COS cells were treated for 48 h with compound 115, a well characterized difluoroketone peptidomimetic γ-secretase inhibitor (6.De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4720-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), at a dose near its reported IC50 for Aβ inhibition (25 μm) or else with an inactive analogue (compound 124) having a closely similar structure. Aβ-like peptides in the conditioned media were detected by Aβ ELISA (Fig. 4 A). Compound 115 produced ∼50% inhibition of Aβ generation in both SW-APP and SW-m-Notch transfectants. In four dose-response experiments, the concentrations of inhibitor needed for 50% inhibition were similar (∼25 μm), although the IC50 for SW-m-Notch was slightly higher (33.83 ± 8.47 μm) than for SW-APP (23.43 ± 4.44 μm) (Fig. 4 B). The average inhibition at 25 μm is 57 ± 6% (S.E.) for SW-APP and 32 ± 14% (S.E.) for SW-m-Notch. This difference is not significant (p > 0.05, n = 4). Single amino acid substitutions placed into the APP TMD have been reported to change the efficiency and precise location of cleavage within the TMD but not block cleavage per se (16.Lichtenthaler S.F. Ida N. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15396-15403Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,17.Lichtenthaler S.F. Wang R. Grimm H. Uljon S.N. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Moreover, the locations of the cleavage sites were found to be near the middle of the TMDs in a serial mutation, deletion, and insertion study of the APP TMD (18.Murphy M.P. Hickman L. Eckman C.B. Uljon S.N. Wang R. Golde T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11914-11923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the luminal and cytosolic domains of APP are not absolutely required for γ-secretase processing (20.Citron M. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 31.Bunnell W. Pham H.V. Glabe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31947-31955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As described above, SW-m-Notch chimeric protein is cleaved by γ-secretase despite substantial sequence differences between the APP and Notch TMDs. To understand whether the specific TM region (m) sequence or the region just N-terminal to the TM (α secretase cleavage region) plays any role in γ-secretase recognition and cleavage, we carried out domain replacements using the corresponding regions of several integral membrane proteins (APLP-2, SREBP-1, HER-3, and Notch-1) (Fig. 1 B). Levels of Aβ-like peptides released from SW-m-APLP-2- and SW-α-SREBP-1-transfected cells were similar or higher than in the SW-APP transfectant (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, levels of Aβ-like peptide released from SW-α-Notch (not shown), SW-α-APLP-2, SW-α-HER-3, SW-m-HER-3, and SW-m-SREBP-1 cells were all substantially decreased (Fig. 5 A). The expression levels of full-length SW-APP and these various chimeras were roughly similar in multiple experiments, except for SW-m-SREBP-1, which consistently yielded very little holoprotein (Fig. 5 B). Thus, any small differences in the amounts of the expressed holoproteins could not account for the substantial differences in the amounts of the derived Aβ-like peptides. Differences in the general protein turnover of the C-terminal fragments generated by the various chimeras could affect availability of these substrates for γ-secretase processing. However, close inspection of the steady-state levels of C99 derived from the chimeras (Fig. 5 B) revealed that they were in reasonable agreement with the respective amounts of Aβ (Fig. 5 A), except for"

Activated phagocytes generate a variety of reactive halogenating species that damage adjacent cells as a part of the normal physiological defense function of phagocytes (1Weiss S.J. N. Engl. J.

Activation of neutrophil NADPH oxidase during the respiratory burst results in the production of superoxide anions that dismutate to produce hydrogen peroxide. Myeloperoxidase amplifies the oxidizing potential of hydrogen peroxide by using it as a substrate in the presence of physiological concentrations of halides to produce hypohalous acids and their conjugate bases, which are the predominant oxygen-derived free radicals produced by activated neutrophils (3Harrison J.E. Schultz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1371-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two of the hypohalous acids produced by the myeloperoxidase system in the presence of chlorine and bromine are hypochlorous and hypobromous acids, respectively (4Thomas E.L. Bozeman P.M.

Lipids are major targets of the reactive halogenating species produced by activated phagocytes. Reactive chlorinating species released by activated neutrophils attack unsaturated –C=C– bonds within the aliphatic chains of phospholipids and form chlorohydrins, which ultimately disrupt normal membrane fluid molecular dynamics (5Winterbourn C.C. van den Berg J.J.

Additionally, reactive chlorinating species produced by myeloperoxidase chlorinate lipoprotein-associated cholesterol, leading to the production of a family of chlorinated cholesterol species including chlorohydrins and dichlorinated products (8Hazen S.L.

We have recently demonstrated that plasmalogens may represent accessible molecular targets of the membrane-permeable, reactive chlorinating species generated by activated phagocytes, resulting in the production of α-chloro fatty aldehydes (22Albert C.J.

The present study was designed to test whether the vinyl ether bond of the sn-1 aliphatic chain of plasmalogens is susceptible to bromination by reactive brominating species produced by myeloperoxidase and to compare this putative halogenation to that mediated by reactive chlorinating species. The results demonstrate for the first time that myeloperoxidase utilizes micromolar concentrations of bromine at neutral pH, resulting in the production of reactive brominating species that attack the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens, leading to the production of lysophospholipids and α-bromo fatty aldehydes. Furthermore, these α-bromo fatty aldehydes are produced by PMA 1The abbreviations used are:PMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyGPCsn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholineGC-MSgas chromatography-mass spectrometryPFBpentafluorobenzyl2-BrHDA2-bromohexadecanal2-BrODA2-bromooctadecanal2-ClHDA2-chlorohexadecanalHBSSHanks' balanced salt solutionMPOmyeloperoxidaseFIDflame ionization detector 1The abbreviations used are:PMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyGPCsn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholineGC-MSgas chromatography-mass spectrometryPFBpentafluorobenzyl2-BrHDA2-bromohexadecanal2-BrODA2-bromooctadecanal2-ClHDA2-chlorohexadecanalHBSSHanks' balanced salt solutionMPOmyeloperoxidaseFIDflame ionization detector-stimulated neutrophils and thus represent a previously uncharacterized product of activated neutrophils. phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate high pressure liquid chromatography sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine gas chromatography-mass spectrometry pentafluorobenzyl 2-bromohexadecanal 2-bromooctadecanal 2-chlorohexadecanal Hanks' balanced salt solution myeloperoxidase flame ionization detector phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate high pressure liquid chromatography sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine gas chromatography-mass spectrometry pentafluorobenzyl 2-bromohexadecanal 2-bromooctadecanal 2-chlorohexadecanal Hanks' balanced salt solution myeloperoxidase flame ionization detector Bromide-free hypobromous acid was prepared as previously described (23Wajon J.E.

Hexadecanoyl chloride was purchased from Nu-Chek Prep. All other reagents and chemicals were purchased from either Aldrich, Sigma, or Fisher. 2-Br-[7,7,8,8-d4 ]-hexadecanal (2-Br-[d4 ]-HDA) was synthesized by the following scheme: 1) synthesis of [7,7,8,8-d4 ]-hexadecanol from [7,7,8,8-d4 ]-hexadecanoic acid (Medical Isotopes, Inc.), using sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminum hydride; 2) synthesis of [7,7,8,8-d4 ]-hexadecanal by partial oxidation at −50 °C, utilizing oxalyl chloride-activated dimethyl sulfoxide as a catalyst (27Mancuso A.J. Huang S.-L. Swern D. J. Org. Chem. 1978; 43: 2480-2482Crossref Scopus (2048) Google Scholar); and 3) synthesis of 2-Br-[d4 ]-HDA utilizingt-butylbromide dimethyl sulfoxide (28Armani E. Dossena R. Marchelli R. Casnati G. Tetrahedron. 1984; 40: 2035-2039Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The synthetic 2-Br-[d4 ]-HDA was purified by HPLC utilizing a Dynamax Si column (21.4 × 250 mm, 8 μm) and isocratic elution with hexane at a flow rate of 6 ml/min. Utilizing this system, 2-Br-[d4 ]-HDA eluted with an RT = 25 min, and the purity was confirmed by TLC, as well as by GC-MS of its PFB oxime derivative (see below). The lysoplasmenylcholine molecular species, 1-O-hexadec-1′-enyl-GPC, was prepared from bovine heart lecithin and purified as previously described (29Han X.L. Zupan L.A. Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Plasmenylcholine was synthesized by an anhydrous reaction utilizing 1-O-hexadec-1′-enyl-GPC and hexadecanoyl chloride as precursors with dimethylaminopyridine as a catalyst and was purified as previously described (29Han X.L. Zupan L.A. Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Synthetically prepared plasmenylcholine and lysoplasmenylcholine were determined to be greater than 95% pure by thin layer chromatography, straight phase HPLC, reversed-phase HPLC, and capillary gas chromatography of the aliphatic constituents. Lysoplasmenylcholine and 16:0-16:0 plasmenylcholine were quantified by capillary gas chromatography. In a typical assay 200 or 300 nmol of either lysoplasmenylcholine or plasmenylcholine was incubated in 300 μl of phosphate buffer supplemented with 100 mm NaBr (or selected concentrations of NaBr and/or NaCl), 20 mm NaPO4, 0.1 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, pH 4–7, in the presence or absence of indicated amounts of myeloperoxidase, H2O2, bromine, or hypobromous acid for indicated intervals at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of methanol, and reaction products were extracted into chloroform by the method of Bligh and Dyer (30Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42790) Google Scholar). Reaction products were separated by TLC utilizing silica gel 60 Å plates (Whatman) and a mobile phase comprised of petroleum ether/ethyl ether/acetic acid (90:10:1, v/v/v) for the separation of neutral lipids. Alternatively, polar lipid reaction products were separated by TLC utilizing silica gel 60Å plates (Whatman) and a mobile phase comprised of chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (6:8:2:2:1, v/v/v/v/v). Reaction products on TLC plates containing an aldehyde or a masked aldehyde were visualized by charring concentrated sulfuric acid-treated plates. In some cases, reaction products or TLC-purified reaction products were extracted from silica by a modified Bligh and Dyer technique (30Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42790) Google Scholar). TLC-purified reaction products were then either subjected to inorganic phosphate analysis (31Dittmer J.C. Wells M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 14: 482-530Crossref Scopus (434) Google Scholar) or capillary gas chromatography following their derivatization with pentafluorobenzyl hydroxylamine (see below) or methanolic HCl (70 °C for 30 min). In some cases, acid methanolysis-derivatized products were subjected to capillary gas chromatography utilizing a Supelco SP-2330 column and detected by FID under conditions previously described (32Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1662-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Alternatively, acid methanolysis-derivatized products were subjected to GC-MS with electron impact ionization. GC-MS was performed on reaction products or TLC-purified reaction products either directly or following derivatization with acidic methanol or pentafluorobenzyl hydroxylamine. In brief, derivatization with pentafluorobenzyl hydroxylamine was performed by resuspending the reaction products in 300 μl of ethanol followed by the addition of 300 μl of 6 mg/ml pentafluorobenzyl hydroxylamine in water. The ethanolic/water mixture was vortexed for 5 min at room temperature and allowed to further incubate at room temperature for an additional 25 min. Reaction products were diluted with 1.2 ml of water, extracted into cyclohexane/diethyl ether (4:1, v/v), and resuspended in 30–100 μl of petroleum ether prior to GC-MS analysis. Samples were analyzed on a DB-1 column (12.5 m, 0.2-mm inner diameter, 0.33-μm methyl silicone film coating, from P.J. Cobert, St. Louis, MO), utilizing a Hewlett Packard 5890 gas chromatograph. The injector temperature and the transfer lines were maintained at 250 °C. The GC oven was maintained at 150 °C for 3.5 min and increased at a rate of 30 °C/min to 270 °C. The oven temperature was held at 270 °C for an additional 2 min. All spectra were acquired on a Hewlett Packard 5988A mass spectrometer (Palo Alto, CA) and operated in the negative chemical ionization mode with methane as the reagent gas. The source temperature was set at 150 °C. The electron energy was 240 eV, and the emission current was 300 μA. Proton NMR spectrometry and analyses were performed at ambient temperature in CDCl3using a Varian Unity 300 spectrometer (7.05T). 1H shifts were referenced to tetramethylsilane. Whole blood (50 ml) was taken from healthy volunteers and anticoagulated with EDTA (final concentration 5.4 mm) prior to the isolation of neutrophils using a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient, as previously described (33Ferrante A. Thong Y. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 36: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Pelleted neutrophils were resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), pH 7.3, supplemented with either 100 μm, 500 μm, or 5 mm NaBr and immediately subjected to experimental protocols. Neutrophils (0.5 × 106cells/ml) were treated with or without (control) 200 nm PMA for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of methanol containing the internal standard (200 pmol of 2-Br-[d4 ]-HDA for a total of 4 × 107 cells extracted). Following Bligh and Dyer (30Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42790) Google Scholar) extraction of neutrophil lipids, 2-BrHDA was purified by thin layer chromatography utilizing the petroleum ether/ethyl ether/acetic acid mobile phase (see above) and quantitated following derivatization to its PFB oxime by GC-MS. The vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens has recently been shown to be a target of the reactive chlorinating species produced by myeloperoxidase (22Albert C.J. Crowley J.R. Hsu F-F. Thukkani A.K. Ford D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23733-23741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The present studies were directed at determining whether the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens is preferentially targeted by reactive brominating species, compared with reactive chlorinating species. As a first step, lysoplasmenylcholine (1-O-hexadec-1′-enyl-GPC) was incubated with myeloperoxidase in phosphate buffer containing hydrogen peroxide and sodium bromide. TLC analysis of the reaction products revealed the loss of lysoplasmenylcholine in the presence of myeloperoxidase, hydrogen peroxide, and sodium bromide at both pH 4 and pH 7 (Fig.1, Solvent System 2). Concomitant with lysoplasmenylcholine loss, a neutral lipid was produced that migrated with an Rf ≅ 0.58 in a solvent system that resolves neutral lipids (Fig. 1, Solvent System 1). This neutral lipid did not co-migrate with either 2-chlorohexadecanal (2-ClHDA)(Rf = 0.46) or multiple molecular species of fatty acid (Rf range for palmitic, palmitoleic, and arachidonic acid = 0.18–0.20) in this TLC system. The loss of lysoplasmenylcholine was dependent on the presence of a complete reaction mixture comprised of active myeloperoxidase (thermal treatment of myeloperoxidase-ablated lysoplasmenylcholine loss), hydrogen peroxide, and sodium bromide (Fig. 1). Similar studies were performed utilizing the plasmenylcholine molecular species, 1-O-hexadec-1′-enyl-2-hexadecanoyl-GPC, as the target phospholipid of the reactive brominating species generated by myeloperoxidase. TLC analysis of the reaction products of this reaction demonstrated plasmenylcholine loss in the presence of the complete myeloperoxidase reactive brominating species system at both pH 4 and pH 7 (Fig. 2, Solvent System 2), concomitant with the production of a neutral lipid, which again migrated with an Rf ≅ 0.58 (Fig. 2, Solvent System 1). Because the sulfuric acid-charring detection method employed in these TLC analyses detects aldehydes and masked aldehydes but does not readily detect lysophosphatidylcholine, further analyses were performed to determine that lysophosphatidylcholine was also produced by the action of reactive brominating species attacking plasmalogens containing an ester-linked sn-2 aliphatic group. Silica corresponding to the region to which lysophosphatidylcholine migrates on the TLC plates that were developed in Solvent System 2 (as well as the remaining silica on the plate) was zonally scraped and extracted (Fig. 3, inset A). The presence of lysophosphatidylcholine in the extract from this silica was confirmed by the presence of inorganic phosphate (Fig. 3) and a palmitic acid residue, as determined by the detection of palmitic acid methyl ester by capillary GC analysis following acid methanolysis (Fig. 3, inset B).Figure 3Analysis of TLC-purified lysophosphatidylcholine produced by myeloperoxidase treatment of plasmenylcholine. 200 nmol of plasmenylcholine was incubated in the presence of the MPO/HOBr generating reagents, including MPO (2.5 units), H2O2 (1 mm), and NaBr (100 mm) in 500 μl of 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 4.0, at 37 °C for 5 min. Incubations were terminated by the addition of methanol, and reaction products were sequentially extracted into chloroform and subjected to TLC with chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water, 6:8:2:2:1, v/v/v/v/v as mobile phase. Reaction products on developed TLC plates were visualized by sulfuric acid treatment and charring (Inset B). In parallel studies, silica from the developed TLC plate was zonally scraped, as indicated (Inset B), and TLC-resolved reaction products were analyzed for inorganic phosphate and aliphatic groups (Inset A), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For capillary GC analysis, the indicated peak, fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) of palmitic acid, had an identical retention time with that of authentic FAME of palmitic acid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The neutral lipid reaction product from the myeloperoxidase-mediated degradation of plasmalogens was further characterized by capillary gas chromatography. Capillary gas chromatography of the acid methanolysis derivatives of the reaction products from lysoplasmenylcholine treatment with reactive brominating species generated by myeloperoxidase resulted in the production of a unique acid methanolysis derivative product with an RT = 12.3 min (Fig.4, panel B, peak 3). In contrast, the dimethyl acetal of hexadecanal (RT = 5.6 min; Fig. 4, panel A, peak 2,) was the only acid methanolysis derivative of untreated lysoplasmenylcholine (i.e. not treated with the myeloperoxidase-generated reactive brominating species). Furthermore, acid methanolysis and subsequent capillary gas chromatography of the TLC-purified neutral lipid (e.g.Rf = 0.58 in Fig. 1, Solvent System 1) demonstrated that this lipid gave rise to the acid methanolysis product with an RT = 12.3 min (Fig. 4, panel C, peak 3). Further studies demonstrated that this product of the myeloperoxidase reaction was only produced from vinyl ether-containing lipids (i.e. plasmenylcholine and lysoplasmenylcholine) and was not produced from lysophosphatidylcholine or hexadecanal (data not shown). Both the neutral lipid produced from lysoplasmenylcholine treatment with the myeloperoxidase reactive brominating species generating system and the acid methanolysis product of the neutral lipid were subjected to GC-MS utilizing electron impact ionization. The ionization spectrum of the underivatized compound included the putative parent ions that would be expected of 2-bromohexadecanal (2-BrHDA) (Fig.5). These ions atm/z 318 and 320 are present at a 1:1 ratio characteristic of monobrominated molecules (due to the ratio of the natural isotopic abundance of 79Br and 81Br at 1:1). The ionization spectrum of the acid methanolysis product of the neutral lipid showed a predominant base ion atm/z 75 that is a signature ion of dimethylacetals, which are acid methanolysis products of masked aldehydes (i.e. the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens) and free aldehydes (data not shown).Figure 5Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the lysoplasmenylcholine/myeloperoxidase reaction product.Lysoplasmenylcholine (200 nmol) was incubated in the presence of the MPO/HOBr generating system, which includes MPO (0.6 unit), H2O2 (1 mm), and NaBr (100 mm) in 300 μl of 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 4.0, at 37 °C for 5 min. Incubations were terminated by the addition of methanol, and reaction products were sequentially extracted into chloroform and subjected to TLC, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The TLC-purified material having an Rf = 0.58 was dried and resuspended in petroleum ether prior to GC-MS with electron impact ionization detection, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Ions and ion fragments (the mass spectrum) are shown of the major peak eluting at 6.55 min (seeinset A for total ion current chromatogram).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Further structural information of the putative monobrominated hexadecanal species produced from plasmalogens by reactive brominating species was obtained by further GC-MS analyses as well as proton NMR analyses. Because the likely brominated reaction product of the myeloperoxidase reaction with plasmalogens contains an aldehyde carbonyl, the carbonyl-reactive derivatization agent, pentafluorobenzyl hydroxylamine, was used to produce the pentafluorobenzyl oxime of the aldehyde for GC-MS analyses utilizing negative chemical ionization. GC-MS analyses on a DB-1 column in the negative ion mode of the PFB oxime derivative of the reaction product from incubations of lysoplasmenylcholine (1-O-hexadec-1′-enyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) with myeloperoxidase, H2O2, and NaBr resulted in the production of two peaks consistent with the production of thesyn and anti isomers of the PFB oxime derivative of 2-BrHDA (Fig. 6, inset A). The fragmentation pattern of the second peak is shown in Fig. 6. The molecular ion (M−) of the PFB oxime of 2-BrHDA is observed at m/z 513 (Fig. 6). Again, monobromination of this compound was confirmed by identifying the isotopic cluster (M−/M− +2 of 1/1 at m/z513 and 515). One of the major fragments at m/z332 is also monobrominated, because an ion of equal intensity was also observed at m/z 334. It should be recognized that the remaining fragmentation pattern is completely consistent with the structure of the PFB oxime of 2-BrHDA shown in Fig. 6, inset B. Additionally, NMR data further supported the most likely structure of the TLC-purified reaction product as 2-BrHDA. In particular, the aldehyde proton is both split by its sole neighboring proton on the α-carbon and shifted downfield because of the neighboring bromine (9.43 parts/million). Also, there is a downfield shift of the brominated methylene of the α-carbon that is split by three neighboring protons. Taken together, this NMR data in conjunction with the GC-MS analysis of both the nonderivatized and derivatized neutral lipid product support the neutral lipid product as 2-BrHDA. The specificity of the degradation of plasmalogens by myeloperoxidase-generated reactive brominating species was further assessed in reactions that included the myeloperoxidase inhibitors sodium azide, catalase, and 3-aminotriazole. Sodium azide, catalase, and 3-aminotriazole inhibited myeloperoxidase-mediated degradation of the vinyl ether bond (Fig. 7). Additionally, the specificity of the reaction of the myeloperoxidase-generated reactive bromine species toward the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens was demonstrated because destruction of the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens by treatment with hydrochloric acid fumes for 10 min ablated the production of the myeloperoxidase-mediated neutral lipid product, 2-BrHDA (Fig. 7). Hypobromous acid is the initial product of the myeloperoxidase reaction in the presence of bromide, and molecular bromine can be produced from hypobromous acid (34Weiss S.J. Test S.T. Eckmann C.M. Roos D. Regiani S. Science. 1986; 234: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Accordingly, further experiments were performed that demonstrate that molar equivalents of either hypobromous acid or molecular bromine mimic the degradation of lysoplasmenylcholine by the reactive-brominating species generated by myeloperoxidase. Data shown in Fig. 8 demonstrate that at neutral pH hypobromous acid and molecular bromine both degrade plasmalogens, resulting in the production of 2-BrHDA. Because data shown in Figs. 1 and 2 demonstrated that 2-BrHDA was produced under both acidic and neutral conditions, the pH dependence of this reaction was further characterized utilizing lysoplasmen"

Here, we examined hRAD51 binding and ATPase inhibition pattern by ADP and ATP/adenosine 5′-<i>O</i>-(thiotriphosphate) (ATPγS). hRAD51 fully saturates with ATP/ATPγS regardless of DNA cofactor (<i>K</i> <sub>D</sub> ≈ 5 μm; 1 ATP/1 hRAD51). The binding of ADP to hRAD51 appeared bimodal. The first mode was identical to ATP/ATPγS binding (<i>K</i> <sub>app1</sub> ≈ 3 μm; 1 ADP/1 hRAD51), while a second mode occurred at elevated ADP concentrations (<i>K</i> <sub>app2</sub> ≥ 125 μm; >1 ADP/1 hRAD51). We could detect ADP → ATP exchange in the high affinity ADP binding mode (<i>K</i> <sub>app1</sub>) but not the low affinity binding mode (<i>K</i> <sub>app2</sub>). At low ATP concentrations (<0.3 mm), ADP and ATPγS competitively inhibit the hRAD51 ATPase (<i>K</i> <sub>m</sub><sub>(app)</sub> ><i>K</i> <sub>m</sub>). However, at high ATP (>0.3 mm), the hRAD51 ATPase was stimulated by concentrations of ATPγS that were 20-fold above the <i>K</i> <sub>D</sub>. Ammonium sulfate plus spermidine decreased the affinity of hRAD51 for ADP substantially (∼10-fold) and ATP modestly (∼3-fold). Our results suggest that ATP binding is not rate-limiting but that the inability to sustain an active nucleoprotein filament probably restricts the hRAD51 ATPase."

These proteins may serve as intracellular storage facilities for molybdate, which they bind with high specificity. High resolution structures of MopII in a number of states, including the first structure of an apo-molbindin, together with calorimetric data, allow us to describe ligand binding and provide support for the proposed storage function of the protein. MopII assembles as a trimer of dimers and binds eight oxyanions at two types of binding sites located at intersubunit interfaces. Two type 1 sites are on the molecular 3-fold axis and three pairs of type 2 sites occur on the molecular 2-fold axes. The hexamer is largely unaffected by the binding of ligand. Molybdate is admitted to the otherwise inaccessible type 2 binding sites by the movement of the N-terminal residues of each protein chain. This contrasts with the structurally related molybdate-dependent transcriptional regulator ModE, which undergoes extensive conformational rearrangements on ligand binding. Despite similarities between the binding sites of ModE and the type 2 sites of MopII the molbindin has a significantly reduced ligand affinity, due, in part, to the high density of negative charges at the center of the hexamer. In the absence of ligand this effects the movement of an important lysine side chain, thereby partially inactivating the binding sites. The differences are consistent with a biological role in molybdate storage/buffering. MopII from Clostridium pasteurianumis a molbindin family member.

Functional ModE is a homodimeric protein, which folds into two distinct domains, an N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal molybdate-binding domain. The latter consists of four mop domains (two from each chain). The structure of the mono-mop molbindin from Sporomusa ovatain complex with tungstate (12.Wagner U.G. Stupperich E. Kratky C. Structure. 2000; 8: 1127-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) shows Mop subunits assembled into a trimer of dimers forming eight oxyanion binding sites. A similar arrangement was found for ModG from Azotobacter vinelandii, a di-mop molbindin. The crystal structure of this protein shows a trimeric arrangement where one ModG molecule takes the place of each Mop dimer (13.Delarbre L. Stevenson C.E.M. White D.J. Mitchenall L.A. Pau R.N.

The protein binds two molybdate anions per dimer. The quaternary structure adopted by the four mop domains of the dimer superimposes on two Mop dimers or two di-mops from the molbindins. The nitrogen-fixing bacterium Clostridium pasteurianumpossesses three distinct genes encoding molbindins (15.Hinton S.M. Freyer G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9371-9380Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar); the three proteins, Mop I through III, are ≈7 kDa in size and show a high degree of amino acid sequence conservation (>86% identity). They consist of a single mop domain and thus belong to the mono-mop molbindin family. We report a number of high resolution crystal structures for C. pasteurianum MopII: two different structures of the apoprotein (Apo1 and Apo2), one structure of the tungstate complex, and two structures of Mop-molybdate complexes (Moo1 and Moo2, named after the Protein Data Bank name for molybdate). The apoprotein and the ligand-bound protein crystallized in different monoclinic crystal forms, both with six Mop molecules per asymmetric unit. In the case of the apoprotein they form a complete hexamer, whereas the ligand-bound structures contain two separate Mop trimers, which are complemented to hexamers by crystallographic symmetry. The structures provide the first view of an apo-molbindin and allow us to characterize the mechanism by which Mop acquires ligands and to compare this mechanism to that described for ModE (2.Gourley D.G.

Calorimetric studies complement the crystallographic analysis, further characterizing molybdate binding to Mop and enabling us to compare ligand affinities with those of ModE. The cloning, expression, and purification of MopII as well as crystallization conditions and data collection procedures for the tungstate, Moo1, and Apo1 complexes are as previously described (16.Harrison J.A. Schüttelkopf A.W. Boxer D.H. Hunter W.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1715-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). After it was determined that the Moo1 structure contained only partially loaded binding sites, more crystals were grown, but this time with the addition of 1 μl of 8 mmNa2MoO4 directly to the drop. Data from these crystals were collected in-house using a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode x-ray source (Cu Kα, λ = 1.5418 Å) and an R-Axis IV image plate detector. The resulting data set (Moo2) was processed and scaled to 2.4 Å using DENZO/SCALEPACK (17.Otwinowski Z. Minor V. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). In the hope of improving the resolution limit of the apo-structure (Apo1: 1.8 Å) a second data set was collected in-house from a crystal grown under the same conditions as described before (16.Harrison J.A. Schüttelkopf A.W. Boxer D.H. Hunter W.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1715-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The experimental setup, scaling, and processing were as for the Moo2 data; the high resolution limit for the new data set (Apo2) is 1.5 Å. Phases were obtained by single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS) using the tungsten anomalous signal from the tungstate data and the isomorphous differences between the tungstate and the Moo1 data. We note that the partial occupancy of the MoO42− sites was fortuitous for the phasing calculations. SOLVE (18.Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

MopII was used as a 1 mg/ml solution in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, with and without addition of a 5-fold molar excess of Na2MoO4. Calorimetric measurements were performed using a VP-ITC instrument (Microcal, Inc.). All experiments were carried out at 25 °C. The concentration of the MopII solutions was determined by the Bradford method (30.Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar), a necessity due to the absence of a (UV) chromophore in the protein. A 100 μm solution of MopII in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, in the calorimetric cell was titrated with sodium molybdate (concentrations between 0.5 and 1.5 mm in the injection syringe) dissolved in the same buffer. The syringe was refilled with titrate during the measurements. As a dilution correction a titration of buffer with sodium molybdate solution in buffer was carried out. After integration, the determined heat of dilution was subtracted from the heat of reaction. The data were integrated and analyzed using Origin 5 (Microcal, Inc.). The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ (www.rcsb.org). Accession codes are given in Table I. The 68-amino acid Mop polypeptide consists predominantly of β-strands (52% of the residues in six strands), most of which (β2–β5) form a twisted antiparallel β-sheet. There is also a short α-helix (10% of residues) between β4 and β5 and two 310-helical segments (η1 and η2; 8% of residues) between β3 and β4 and between β5 and β6, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). In all crystal structures six Mop subunits form a compact hexamer with 32-point group symmetry and a diameter of about 60 Å (Fig. 2, A and B). An area of approximately 17,400 Å2 (≈55% of the accessible monomer surface) is buried upon oligomerization. The previous structures of S. ovata Mop and ModG show a similar quaternary structure. The Mop hexamer is observed by mass spectrometry and by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Moreover, considering that all ligand binding sites are formed through the interaction of two or more subunits, it is likely that the hexamer represents the functional unit. We are furthermore confident that the reported hexameric apo-structures are physiologically meaningful, because the mass spectra show the hexamer peak even in the absence of ligand. For the following discussion the six chains have been assigned chain identifiers A through F as shown in Fig. 2 C. We use these chain names to differentiate between the two trimers and more generally the two poles of the molecule (ABC and DEF). In the case of the two apo-structures, the chain names used are identical to those in the deposited coordinate sets. The crystallographic symmetry in the ligand-bound structures means that the chain identifiers A–F as used here are actually chains A, B, C, A*, B*, C* or D*, E*, F*, D, E, F (where X* is symmetry-related to X). The hexamer possesses three unique intersubunit interfaces (Fig. 2 C), one between subunits from the same trimer (yellow edges in Fig. 2 C) and two interfaces between subunits from opposite trimers (both with internal 2-fold symmetry;red and green edges). The most extensive interaction occurs at the “red” interface, which contributes ∼3 × 2950 Å2 of the buried accessible surface and involves 29 residues on each side. The main feature of this interface is the interaction between β5 from either subunit and β6 from the other subunit. This results in the extension of the central β-sheets to two Greek-key β-barrels, which display structural similarity to the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding fold (31.Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). The interaction between β5 and β6′ (primes are used to denote a different chain) accounts for eight of the sixteen direct hydrogen bonds formed across the red interface, the remaining hydrogen bonds are formed between strand β4 and side chains from β2′ as well as backbone atoms from η2′. In addition to these direct interactions, this interface also includes 16 water-bridged hydrogen-bonding contacts. Contacts across the green interface (about 3 × 1180 Å2 of buried surface) are formed by 13 residues from helix α1, strands β1 and β4, and the 310-helix η2 on either side; interactions include a salt bridge between Arg6 and Glu46′ and 10 direct hydrogen bonds. Six of the eight oxyanion binding sites are formed at this interface (see below). The yellow interface buries 6 × 1040 Å2of solvent-accessible surface area with about 70% of this surface being hydrophobic in nature. Its principal feature is the antiparallel alignment of β6 with β1′, which is stabilized by three direct hydrogen bonds and two bridging waters and further extends the central β-sheet. Strands β3 and β4 as well as η2 from both sides participate in further contacts, providing three more direct hydrogen bonds. With the exception of Apo2 (see below) the backbone conformations are remarkably similar between subunits both within any structure (root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) values for Cα atoms after pairwise alignment less than 0.4 Å) and between different structures (r.m.s.d. values for Cα atoms less than 0.5 Å). In the case of the two apo-structures, an even higher degree of similarity is observed between subunits from the same trimer (r.m.s.d. less than 0.08 Å). The observed similarity is not an artifact of refinement, because only weak restraints on non-crystallographic symmetry were applied or, in the case of Apo2, none at all. C. pasteurianum MopII possesses eight oxyanion binding sites per hexamer, all of which make use of the oligomeric assembly: two sites lie on the molecular 3-fold axis at the centers of the two trimers, whereas the remaining six are located at the green interfaces (Fig. 2, A andB). In accordance with Wagner et al. (12.Wagner U.G. Stupperich E. Kratky C. Structure. 2000; 8: 1127-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) these anion binding positions are referred to as type 1 and type 2 sites, respectively. Type 1 sites are formed by the bend between β2 and β3 from three Mop chains related by the molecular 3-fold axis (Figs. 1 A,2, and 3 A). The symmetry of the binding site is mirrored by the ligand binding mode: The central metal atom and one of the oxygen atoms lie on the 3-fold axis. This axial oxygen points into the hexamer, whereas the other three oxygens face outwards and each one toward a different subunit (cf. Fig. 2 B). The bound oxyanion forms twelve hydrogen bonds with the protein, three of them at the axial oxygen, which is contacted by the side-chain hydroxyl of Thr22 from all three Mop chains. The other oxygen atoms each accept three hydrogen bonds from the backbone amides of Val20, Val21, and Thr22 of one protein molecule, although the latter is relatively weak at an average distance of 3.3 Å. It is noteworthy that no positively charged groups are involved in binding of the oxyanion at this site, in fact no such groups exist within a radius of 9 Å from the oxyanion. With the exception of a hydrogen bond from the Thr22 side chain, interactions with the ligand are limited to the protein backbone. The lack of sequence conservation for the residues involved (Fig. 1 B) is consistent with this observation. Type 2 sites occur in pairs at the three green interfaces and are created by β1 as well as η2 from one subunit and the α1′ helix from the other subunit. The protein donates eight hydrogen bonds to the ligand, five from β1/η2, and three from α1′. Two of the ligand oxygens accept only one hydrogen bond (from the Ser4hydroxyl and the Lys60 amine, respectively), the third oxygen forms the remaining three hydrogen bonds with the same subunit (with the Arg6 backbone amide and both the amide and the side chain hydroxyl from Ser61). The fourth oxygen accepts all three hydrogen bonds from the other subunit (amide and hydroxyl of Ser40′ and hydroxyl of Ser43′ from consecutive turns of the helix, Fig. 3 B). In this case partial compensation for the negative charge of the ligand is afforded by the side chain of Lys60. Most of the residues participating in the formation of type 2 sites are at least functionally conserved, as should be expected given that most of them contact the oxyanion with their side chains. Only Ser43 and Ser61 are replaced by alanine or glycine in some molbindins (Fig. 1 B). Arg6 is conserved in almost all mop proteins, despite the fact that its side chain does not contribute to molybdate binding, instead forming an important salt bridge with Glu46′ as described above. Aside from a few exceptions that will be described, the similarity in backbone conformation between the various MopII structures can be extended to the side-chain conformations, with subunit-subunit alignments typically resulting in r.m.s.d. values below 0.7 Å for ≈480 atoms. Most of the ligand binding sites in the apo-structures are also similar to the corresponding ligand-filled sites. In the absence of ligand, the positions of its oxygen atoms are populated by solvent atoms. The best correspondence between apo- and ligand-bound structures is observed for type 1 sites (Fig. 4 A), alignment of Apo1 with the tungstate complex puts solvent molecules within 0.7 Å of all tungstate oxygens. However, a noticeable difference lies in the position of Val20: Its side chains, which limit access to the site from the bulk solvent, move slightly outwards in the apo forms compared with ligand-bound structures, thereby widening the access bore from an average diameter of 5.6 Å (ligand-bound) to ∼7.5 Å (apo) and thus facilitating ligand access. The slightly increased space requirements of the solvent structure compared with the oxyanion may account for this. The three type 2 sites located closer toward the DEF pole of Apo1 are also structurally similar to their liganded counterparts (Fig. 4 B). One minor difference concerns the side chain of Ser61, which appears in two alternate conformations in Apo1. Again ligand oxygen equivalent positions are occupied by solvent molecules. Only the solvent molecule hydrogen-bonding to the Lys60 side chain is about 1.1 Å from the ideal position, which allows it to form an additional hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl of Ser61 in its alternate conformation (asterisk in Fig. 4 B). A more prominent difference is observed for the type 2 sites closer to the ABC poles of both apo-structures (Fig. 4 C): The side chain of Lys60 adopts a completely different conformation pointing away from the binding site. Subsequently, the solvent molecule that accepted a hydrogen bond from Lys60 in the other sites has moved even further (up to 2.0 Å from the closest aligned oxyanion oxo position, not shown). The largest difference from the ligand-bound structures can be observed in the DEF half of Apo2 (Fig. 5): The N-terminal six residues of chains A, B, and C (chain B in Fig. 5) move up to 6 Å outwards, thereby partly exposing the type 2 site underneath. Concomitantly minor movements of surrounding residues, including the C terminus of a neighboring chain (chain A in Fig. 5) and residues 46–48 from another chain (chain D in Fig. 5), can be observed. This more open conformation demonstrates how the otherwise solvent-inaccessible type 2 sites may acquire ligand molecules. Initial refinement of the Moo1 complex resulted in the eight molybdenum atoms having unexpectedly high temperature factors compared with their oxo ligands. Given the solvent arrangement in the apo-structures, coupled with the absence of lower-mass oxyanions from the crystallization conditions, we interpret the observed electron density as resulting from partially molybdate-occupied sites. The superposition of actual oxyanion oxygens and solvent molecules (both with partial occupancy) mimics fully occupied oxo ligands. The occupancies for the molybdenum atoms were reduced to 0.5 and 0.25 for type 1 and type 2 sites, respectively, which brought the temperature factors more in line with those of the surrounding protein atoms. A further indication of the partial ligand occupancy in this structure is the observation that the side chain of Lys60 exhibits a dual conformation in two of the protein chains, pointing both toward the nearby type 2 site (as in the fully loaded structures) and toward the center of the oligomer as in the apo-subunits. The partially occupied binding sites in Moo1 also underline the lack of structural differences between apo- and ligand-bound Mop. In addition, the oxyanions in the two type 1 sites of Moo1 adopt a different orientation from the one seen in the other loaded structures: The ligand is again oriented along the 3-fold axis, only now the axial oxygen points outwards. The three equatorial oxygens are in approximately the same position as in the other structures (Fig. 4 D). The hydrogen bond donors and the number"

These experiments identified an amino-terminal sequence of corticosteroid binding globulin (residues 1–19) that is sufficient to direct a chimera with antithrombin mainly to the apical side. A deletion/mutagenesis analysis showed that no individual amino acid is absolutely required for the apical targeting ability of amino acids 1–30 of corticosteroid binding globulin. The corresponding amino-terminal sequences of α1-antitrypsin and C1 inhibitor were also sufficient to confer apical sorting.

Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). There is evidence that basolateral sorting of the receptors for transferrin and low density lipoproteins is mediated by AP-1 clathrin adaptors with an epithelia-specific isoform of subunit μ1 (μ1B; Ref. 5.Folsch H.

Apical signals appear to be localized to the noncytosolic segments of membrane proteins, since truncation mutants lacking the cytosolic and transmembrane portions were generally found to retain apical polarity (6.Vogel L.K.

With respect to polarized secretion of secretory proteins, it has been shown, for example, that Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) 1The abbreviations used are: MDCKMadin-Darby canine kidneyATantithrombinα1α1-antitrypsinCBGcorticosteroid binding globulinC1C1 inhibitorPAI-1plasminogen activator inhibitor-11The abbreviations used are: MDCKMadin-Darby canine kidneyATantithrombinα1α1-antitrypsinCBGcorticosteroid binding globulinC1C1 inhibitorPAI-1plasminogen activator inhibitor-1cells secrete gp80/clusterin (17.Urban J.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), are secreted equally from both plasma membrane domains. It was shown that N-linked glycans can act as apical targeting signals for secretory proteins, based on the observation that growth hormone, normally secreted in a nonpolarized manner from MDCK cells, is secreted mainly from the apical side after insertion of one or twoN-linked glycosylation sites (22.Scheiffele P. Peranen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In addition, erythropoietin, which is normally secreted at the apical side of MDCK cells, is secreted in a nonpolarized manner after mutation of two distinct N-linked glycosylation consensus sequences (18.Kitagawa Y. Sano Y. Ueda M. Higashio K. Narita H. Okano M. Matsumoto S.-I. Sasaki R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, N-linked glycosylation is not the only apical targeting signal for secretory proteins, since mutagenesis of the sixN-glycosylation sites of CBG, individually or together, did not affect its apical secretion from MDCK cells (23.Larsen J.E. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Vogel L.K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Other examples where mutation of the only N-glycosylation site did not affect the polarity of secretion are the Hepatitis B surface antigen (24.Marzolo M.P. Bull P. Gonzalez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1834-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and a soluble form of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (25.Yeaman C. Le Gall A.H. Baldwin A.N. Monlauzeur L. Le Bivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In addition, chromogranin A is not N-glycosylated but nevertheless is secreted mainly from the apical side of MDCK cells (26.Kuhn U. Cohn D.V. Gorr S.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, there seem to be at least two mechanisms of apical sorting of secretory proteins, either dependent or independent ofN-glycans. Madin-Darby canine kidney antithrombin α1-antitrypsin corticosteroid binding globulin C1 inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 Madin-Darby canine kidney antithrombin α1-antitrypsin corticosteroid binding globulin C1 inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 To characterize N-glycan-independent apical sorting, we studied members of the serpin family as model proteins. Some of them, including CBG (19.Musto N.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) α1-antitrypsin (α1) and C1 inhibitor (C1), were found to be secreted apically from MDCK cells, whereas other members, including antithrombin (AT) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), are secreted in a nonsorted manner (27.Vogel L.K. Larsen J.E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The structural similarity allowed the construction of chimeras to identify the sequence requirements for apical sorting. In the present study we have shown that amino-terminal segments of the three serpins, CBG, α1, and C1, are sufficient to direct AT to the apical side of MDCK cells. A combined deletion and mutagenesis analysis showed that no individual amino acid is essential for the ability of residues 1–30 of CBG to direct AT mainly apically from MDCK cells. MDCK cells (strain II), a kind gift from K. Mostov (University of California), were maintained and transfected as described previously (6.Vogel L.K. Spiess M. Sjostrom H. Noren O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2794-2797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were grown in modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. COS-1 cells were transfected using FuGENETM (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For sorting experiments, 106 cells per well were seeded onto Transwell filters (Costar Europe Ltd., Badhoevedorp, The Nederlands; pore size, 0.4 μm; diameter, 24.5 mm) allowing separate access to the apical and basolateral membranes. Filters were used for experiments 1–2 days after confluence as judged by assessing the tightness of the monolayer (28.Wessels H.P. Geffen I. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions the monolayers have a transepithelial resistance of ∼450 ohms cm2 measured by a Millicell®-ERS voltohmmeter (Millipore Continental Water Systems, Bedford, MA). The pRc/CMV vector was used for recombinant expression of all constructs. cDNAs encoding human CBG (29.Hammond G.L. Smith C.L. Goping I.S. Underhill D.A. Harley M.J. Reventos J. Musto N.A.

Huber R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4292-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) were used. Chimeras were generated using standard DNA techniques. The rat enkephalin signal sequence (33.Cescato R. Dumermuth E. Spiess M. Paganetti P.A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was used in the following constructs: ΔAT36–419, ΔAT41–419, ΔCBG6–30AT, and ΔCBG12–30AT. ΔCBG6–30AT and ΔAT41–419 were constructed so they contain the same 3′- and 5′-untranslated regions, the same cleavable signal peptide, and apart from the amino-terminal 25 amino acids, the same coding sequence. All cDNA constructs were verified by sequencing. Numbers in construct names refer to amino acid number of the mature protein after signal peptidase cleavage. Confluent MDCK cells seeded on filters were preincubated for 30 min in methionine-free medium and thereafter pulse-labeled with 500 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine in methionine-free minimal essential medium added to the basolateral chamber. After a 20-min pulse, the medium was removed, and 1 ml of chase medium was added to both the apical and basolateral chambers. After a 4-h chase, the apical and basolateral media were collected and used for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (34.Vogel L.K. Noren O. Sjostrom H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22933-22938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed using NuPAGE gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). A rabbit anti-human CBG-antiserum (35.Robinson P.A. Hammond G.L. J. Endocrinol. 1985; 104: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was used for immunoprecipitation of wild-type CBG and AT·CBG20–383. Affinity-purified sheep anti-rabbit antithrombin IgG (a kind gift from Dr. Sheffield and Dr. Blajchman, McMaster University, Ontario, Canada) was used for immunoprecipitation of rabbit antithrombin and all chimeras except AT·CBG20–383. To ensure that the immunoprecipitations were quantitative, each sample was subjected to a series of 2-fold dilutions. An equal volume of each dilution was immunoprecipitated separately with a fixed amount of antibody, analyzed on NuPAGE gels, and quantified using a phosphorimager. Linearity of the signal confirmed that immunoprecipitation was quantitative (as shown previously (23.Larsen J.E. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Vogel L.K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)). Three members of the serpin family (CBG, α1, C1) are secreted apically from MDCK cells, whereas AT and PAI-1 are secreted in a nonpolarized manner (19.Musto N.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 27.Vogel L.K. Larsen J.E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To identify the apical targeting determinant we generated chimeras between an apically targeted member of the family and a nonsorted member. We first chose CBG and AT, which have 33% identity and 45% similarity, and for which good antibodies were available. It has previously been observed that stable transfected clonal cell lines expressing CBG showed some variation in the efficiency of apical secretion in the range of 69–83% apical (19.Musto N.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To eliminate clonal variation, transfected G418-resistant cells expressing CBG (approximately 200 independent clones) were pooled. The cells were grown to confluence on filters, pulse-labeled for 20 min with [35S]methionine, and chased for 4 h. The apical and basolateral media were collected, subjected to immunoprecipitation, and analyzed by NuPAGE-gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 1, wild-type CBG was secreted in a polarized manner from a pool of MDCK clones with an apical/basolateral ratio of 78/22. Wild-type CBG (and some of the chimeras, see below) runs as multiple bands due to partial utilization of three of its sixN-glycosylation sites (36.Avvakumov G.V. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 53: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Essentially the same results were obtained in three independent transfections. This is very similar to what had been obtained for individually isolated clones of MDCK cells expressing the protein (19.Musto N.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 23.Larsen J.E. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Vogel L.K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recombinantly expressed AT was secreted from a pool of clones at an apical/basolateral ratio of 44/56 (Fig. 1), which is similar to the result obtained when individual isolated clones were analyzed (27.Vogel L.K. Larsen J.E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). On this basis we decided to analyze pools of clones instead of individual clones throughout this study. Initially a series of eight chimeras was generated between CBG and AT. The first chimera consisted of the amino terminus of CBG, including the signal peptide and amino acids 1–43 of the mature protein fused in-frame with the complementary carboxyl terminus of AT (amino acids 80–419) Fig. 2. This construct was named CBG1–43AT. The reverse construct containing the signal peptide and the amino-terminal part of AT up to amino acid 79 (Fig. 2) followed by the complementary carboxyl terminus portion of CBG was correspondingly named AT·CBG44–383. CBG1–43AT and AT·CBG44–383 thus are each others inverted chimera. We also constructed CBG1–113AT, AT·CBG114–383, CBG1–215AT, AT·CBG216–383, CBG1–297AT, and AT·CBG298–383, a total of four pairs of inverted chimeras. As a first test of expression and secretion, the eight chimeras and wild-type CBG and AT were transiently transfected into COS-1 cells. All constructs were expressed. However, after a 20-min pulse and a 4-h chase, only wild-type AT, wild-type CBG, and the chimera CBG1–43AT were efficiently secreted (data not shown), indicating that the other seven chimeras were not efficiently folded in the endoplasmic reticulum. We did not study these seven chimeras further. All constructs described in this study were tested for expression and secretion efficiency in COS-1 cells and/or MDCK cells in this manner. Only constructs with expression and secretion efficiency between the two wild-type proteins were analyzed further unless otherwise stated. When expressed in MDCK cells and analyzed on filters as described above, CBG1–43AT was secreted predominantly from the apical surface, with an apical/basolateral ratio of 79/21 (Fig. 1). The amino-terminal 43 amino acids of CBG are thus sufficient to confer apical targeting to the chimeric protein. To further define the peptide sufficient for apical targeting, we constructed three new chimeras, CBG1–34AT, CBG1–30AT, and CBG1–19AT (Fig. 2). In MDCK cells, all three chimeric proteins were secreted mainly from the apical side (Fig. 1) with apical/basolateral ratios of 81/19, 85/15, and 75/25 for CBG1–34AT, CBG1–30AT, and CBG1–19AT, respectively. These experiments narrowed the sequence sufficient to confer apical targeting down to residues 1–19 of CBG. The chimeric constructs described so far are all shorter at the amino terminus than AT, which has an amino-terminal extension compared with CBG. To investigate whether the apical secretion of the chimeric molecules is due to the peptide sequence transferred from CBG or to the truncation of the molecule, the 35 amino-terminal residues of AT were deleted by fusing a cleavable signal peptide in front of amino acids 36–419 of AT. The resulting construct was named ΔAT36–419 (Fig. 2). In a second version of this construct, ΔAT41–419, an additional 5 amino acids were deleted at the amino terminus (Fig. 2). Upon expression in filter-grown MDCK cells ΔAT36–419 was secreted with an apical/basolateral ratio of 50/50 and ΔAT41–419 with an apical/basolateral ratio of 52/48 (data not shown). As a control, the secretion of gp80/clusterin, an endogenous apical secretory protein, was also examined and found to be secreted mainly apically from the cells expressing ΔAT36–419 and ΔAT41–419(data not shown). These cells thus have not lost their ability to target proteins to the apical side. Truncation of the amino terminus of AT alone is therefore not enough to induce apical targeting of the molecule. Like CBG, the serpins α1 and C1 are also secreted mainly apically from MDCK cells (27.Vogel L.K. Larsen J.E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). An alignment of the amino-terminal sequences of these three serpins and the two nonsorted serpins, AT and PAI-1 (Fig. 3A), shows a big diversity in length and sequence, also when only the apically secreted serpins are compared. To determine whether the amino terminus of α1 or C1 can, like that of CBG, direct a chimera with AT into the apical pathway, we constructed the two chimeras, α11–39AT and C11–132AT, consisting of amino acids 1–39 of α1 and 1–132 of C1, respectively, fused to their corresponding carboxyl terminus of AT. α11–39AT was fused at the same point as CBG1–30AT, whereas the fusion point of C11–132AT was one amino acid further toward the amino terminus. Both constructs were secreted mainly to the apical side with an apical/basolateral ratio of 71/29 for α11–39AT and of 75/25 for C11–132AT (Fig. 3B). The amino-terminal portions of α1 and C1 are thus equally capable of conferring apical targeting to AT as that of CBG. We investigated the significance of residues 1–30 of CBG for apical targeting more in detail. To test whether amino acids 1–5 of CBG are important, we made a construct containing a cleavable signal peptide and amino acids 6–30 of CBG followed by the complementary carboxyl-terminal end of AT (ΔCBG6–30AT) (Fig. 2). ΔCBG6–30AT is secreted from MDCK cells at an apical/basolateral ratio of 67/33 Fig. 4. This shows that amino acids 1–5 of CBG are not necessary for apical targeting. Deletion of an additional 6 residues (ΔCBG12–30AT) resulted in a chimeric protein that was hardly secreted (not shown), suggesting that residues 6–11 are important for efficient folding of the protein. To investigate the importance of each individual amino acid in the sequence 6–30 of CBG for the apical targeting ability, we mutated individual amino acids in the CBG1–30AT construct to the amino acid present at the corresponding position in AT according to our alignment shown in Fig. 3. When comparing the sequence 6–30 of CBG and the corresponding sequence of AT, there are 7 positions where the two proteins have identical amino acids. Thus a total of 18 mutants were constructed. Upon expression in MDCK cells all but one of the mutant proteins (CBG1–30AT H14V) were efficiently secreted into the media and all of them with essentially the same polarity as CBG1–30AT (Fig. 5). The mutation H14V was instead constructed in the context of CBG1–19AT, and the resulting protein (CBG1–19AT H14V) was efficiently expressed and secreted predominantly into the apical medium essentially like CBG1–19AT. These results show that no single amino acid is absolutely required for apical targeting of the amino acids 1–30 of CBG. Our results show that the amino-terminal 19 residues of CBG are sufficient for apical targeting of a chimera with AT. To test whether the amino-terminal sequence is the only determinant of polarity, AT·CBG20–383,i.e. the inverted chimera of CBG1–19AT, was constructed. AT·CBG20–383 was secreted apically from MDCK cells at an apical/basolateral ratio of 70/30 (Fig. 4). This result shows that the carboxyl terminus of CBG contains additional determinants conferring apical targeting to a chimeric protein. Similarly, AT·CBG31–383, the inverted chimera of CBG1–30AT, was secreted mainly to the apical side of MDCK cells, but at a lower rate than wild-type CBG (data not shown). Polarized secretion might be generated by signal-mediated delivery to one surface and a default pathway to the other. Alternatively, delivery to both destinations may be signal-mediated. It was recently shown that the apical sorting machinery in RPE-J cells could be saturated by overexpression (37.Marmorstein A.D. Csaky K.G. Baffi J. Lam L. Rahaal F. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3248-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that apical secretion is signal-mediated at least in this cell line. In the present study, we analyzed the sorting of members of the serpin family that are either targeted predominantly to the apical side of MDCK monolayers (CBG, α1, and C1) or secreted in a nonpolarized manner (AT and PAI-1). Analyzing chimeras between CBG and AT, we found that a short peptide derived from the amino-terminal end of CBG is able to confer apical targeting to the recombinant proteins. Apical secretion was not due to truncation of the 35-amino acid amino-terminal extension present in AT and lacking in CBG, since its deletion did not result in apical targeting. The amino-terminal extension of AT thus does not carry basolateral sorting information or hide apical sorting information. Amino acids 1–19 or 6–30 of CBG are able to confer apical targeting, suggesting that the determinant is contained within residues 6–19 of CBG. The amino-terminal sequences of α1 (residues 1–39) and of C1 (residues 1–132) are also able to confer apical targeting to the corresponding AT fusion proteins. Comparison of these sequences reveals hardly any conservation on the amino acid level. There is only one conserved position, a hydrophobic residue at the position corresponding to residue 17 of CBG. However, the two nonsorted serpins also have a hydrophobic amino acid at this position (Leu in AT and Val in PAI-1). The presence of a nonpolar side chain at this position is thus likely to be preferred in the serpin fold, but unlikely to be crucial for apical targeting. We are thus unable to identify a peptide motif putatively responsible for apical targeting. A combined deletion and mutagenesis analysis showed that no single amino acid in residues 1–30 of CBG is absolutely required for apical targeting. However, as both residues 1–19 and 20–383 of CBG are able to confer apical targeting ability, it is formally possible, albeit not very likely, that residues 1–30 of CBG contain two apical determinants, and consequently the mutagenesis analysis would miss identifying them. However, the lack of conservation between the amino-terminals of CBG, α1, and C1 suggest that apical targeting is not mediated by a conserved linear amino acid sequence. This situation is reminiscent of that recently described for the apical sorting of the α-subunit of the gastric H,K-ATPase. Analysis of chimeras between the α-subunits of the apical H,K-ATPase and of the homologous basolateral Na,K-ATPase identified the predicted fourth transmembrane domain (TM4) of the H,K-ATPase as sufficient for apical sorting in LLC-PK1 cells (13.Dunbar L.A. Aronson P. Caplan M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the two flanking regions of TM4 were also able to redirect the protein to the apical side of the cells, whereas either one of the flanking sequences alone was not (13.Dunbar L.A. Aronson P. Caplan M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The flanking sequences were proposed to induce a conformational change in TM4 of the Na,K-ATPase, mimicking the conformation of TM4 of the H,K-ATPase. Alternatively, TM4 or the flanking sequences of the H,K-ATPase may impose certain conformations on other parts of the protein, which could then be recognized by components of the apical sorting machinery. In a similar manner the serpins analyzed here may carry a conformation-dependent apical sorting signal either in the amino terminus or elsewhere in the protein. In the present study we have shown that not only amino acids 1–19 of CBG carry apical targeting information, but also amino acids 20–383. Redundant signals thus appear to ensure correct cellular localization of CBG, comparable with the low density lipoprotein receptor and CD1d, which was shown to have multiple basolateral sorting signals (38.Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar,39.Rodionov D.G. Nordeng T.W. Kongsvik T.L. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8279-8282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Also influenza virus neuraminidase, a transmembrane protein, possesses two apical determinants: one in the ectodomain (10.Kundu A. Nayak D.P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1812-1818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the other in the transmembrane domain (40.Kundu A. Avalos R.T. Sanderson C.M. Nayak D.P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6508-6515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Residues 1–30 of CBG contain one consensus sequence forN-glycosylation at Asn9, but mutation of this site in the context of wild-type CBG (23.Larsen J.E. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Vogel L.K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) or in the context of CBG1–30AT (CBG1–30AT N9A or CBG1–30AT S11N) did not disturb apical targeting of the recombinant product. As CBG may have redundant apical targeting information, even within residues 1–30, N-glycosylation alone is not the apical determinant, but it cannot be excluded thatN-glycosylation serves as an apical targeting determinant in addition to a determinant of a different nature. CBG does not carryO-linked glycosylation, which had been suggested to act as an apical determinant for the neurotrophin receptor (25.Yeaman C. Le Gall A.H. Baldwin A.N. Monlauzeur L. Le Bivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It cannot be formally excluded that the effect of the amino-terminal sequence of CBG on sorting is not due to the introduction of an apical sorting determinant, but is instead attributable to the disruption of a weak basolateral localization signal in AT. However, we consider this unlikely, since a number of exogenous proteins from diverse sources lacking polarized sorting are secreted in a nonpolarized manner from MDCK cells (6.Vogel L.K. Spiess M. Sjostrom H. Noren O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2794-2797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Gottlieb T.A. Beaudry G. Rizzolo L. Colman A. Rindler M. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2100-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21.Vogel L.K. Suske G. Beato M. Noren O. Sjostrom H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We envision that the apical targeting of serpins is a receptor-mediated process and that the receptors in turn have a regulated intracellular traffic. It has been suggested that detergent-resistant membranes function as apical targeting platforms (41.Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7941) Google Scholar). In addition it was recently shown that the apically targeted, secretory protein thyroglobulin associates with detergent-resistant membranes during transport to the cell membrane (42.Martin-Belmonte F. Alonso M.A. Zhang X. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41074-41081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, a correlation between apical targeting and association to the detergent-resistant membrane could not be observed when wild-type serpins and chimeras of serpins were investigated. 2J. E. Larsen, H. Sjöström, O. Norén, and L. K. Vogel, submitted for publication. It is thus unlikely that detergent-resistant membranes are involved in the apical transport of serpins. In this paper we have shown that the exchange of a short NH2-terminal peptide of the nonsorted serpin AT by the nonconserved NH2-terminal peptides derived from three apical members of the serpin family is able to confer apical targeting. On this basis we suggest that polarized sorting of the apically secreted serpins does not depend on a strictly conserved linear sequence but may depend on the protein's conformation.
