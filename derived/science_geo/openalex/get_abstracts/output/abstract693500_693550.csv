https://openalex.org/W4280563114,"Enhancer sequences control gene expression and comprise binding sites (motifs) for different transcription factors (TFs). Despite extensive genetic and computational studies, the relationship between DNA sequence and regulatory activity is poorly understood, and de novo enhancer design has been challenging. Here, we built a deep-learning model, DeepSTARR, to quantitatively predict the activities of thousands of developmental and housekeeping enhancers directly from DNA sequence in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. The model learned relevant TF motifs and higher-order syntax rules, including functionally nonequivalent instances of the same TF motif that are determined by motif-flanking sequence and intermotif distances. We validated these rules experimentally and demonstrated that they can be generalized to humans by testing more than 40,000 wildtype and mutant Drosophila and human enhancers. Finally, we designed and functionally validated synthetic enhancers with desired activities de novo. A deep-learning model called DeepSTARR quantitatively predicts enhancer activity on the basis of DNA sequence. The model learns relevant motifs and syntax rules, allowing for the design of synthetic enhancers with specific strengths."
https://openalex.org/W4280506645,"SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, builds a membrane-bound replication organelle to enable RNA replication1. The SARS-CoV-2 replication organelle is composed of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) that are tethered to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by thin membrane connectors2, but the viral proteins and the host factors involved remain unknown. Here we identify the viral non-structural proteins (NSPs) that generate the SARS-CoV-2 replication organelle. NSP3 and NSP4 generate the DMVs, whereas NSP6, through oligomerization and an amphipathic helix, zippers ER membranes and establishes the connectors. The NSP6(ΔSGF) mutant, which arose independently in the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Eta, Iota and Lambda variants of SARS-CoV-2, behaves as a gain-of-function mutant with a higher ER-zippering activity. We identified three main roles for NSP6: first, to act as a filter in communication between the replication organelle and the ER, by allowing lipid flow but restricting the access of ER luminal proteins to the DMVs; second, to position and organize DMV clusters; and third, to mediate contact with lipid droplets (LDs) through the LD-tethering complex DFCP1-RAB18. NSP6 thus acts as an organizer of DMV clusters and can provide a selective means of refurbishing them with LD-derived lipids. Notably, both properly formed NSP6 connectors and LDs are required for the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings provide insight into the biological activity of NSP6 of SARS-CoV-2 and of other coronaviruses, and have the potential to fuel the search for broad antiviral agents."

https://openalex.org/W4280512834,"To learn how genomic sequence influences multiscale three-dimensional (3D) genome architecture, this manuscript presents a sequence-based deep-learning approach, Orca, that predicts directly from sequence the 3D genome architecture from kilobase to whole-chromosome scale. Orca captures the sequence dependencies of structures including chromatin compartments and topologically associating domains, as well as diverse types of interactions from CTCF-mediated to enhancer-promoter interactions and Polycomb-mediated interactions with cell-type specificity. Orca enables various applications including predicting structural variant effects on multiscale genome organization and it recapitulated effects of experimentally studied variants at varying sizes (300 bp to 90 Mb). Moreover, Orca enables in silico virtual screens to probe the sequence basis of 3D genome organization at different scales. At the submegabase scale, it predicted specific transcription factor motifs underlying cell-type-specific genome interactions. At the compartment scale, virtual screens of sequence activities suggest a model for the sequence basis of chromatin compartments with a prominent role of transcription start sites."

Dorzagliatin is a dual-acting, orally bioavailable glucokinase activator that enhances glucokinase activity in a glucose-dependent manner, improves glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and demonstrates effects on glycemic control in patients with T2D. We report the findings of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dorzagliatin in patients with T2D. Eligible drug-naïve patients with T2D (n = 463) were randomly assigned to the dorzagliatin or placebo group at a ratio of 2:1 for 24 weeks of double-blind treatment, followed by 28 weeks of open-label treatment with dorzagliatin for all patients. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in glycated hemoglobin from baseline to week 24. Safety was assessed throughout the trial. At week 24, the least-squares mean change in glycated hemoglobin from baseline (95% confidence interval) was -1.07% (-1.19%, -0.95%) in the dorzagliatin group and -0.50% (-0.68%, -0.32%) in the placebo group (estimated treatment difference, -0.57%; 95% confidence interval: -0.79%, -0.36%; P < 0.001). The incidence of adverse events was similar between the two groups. There were no severe hypoglycemia events or drug-related serious adverse events in the dorzagliatin group. In summary, dorzagliatin improved glycemic control in drug-naïve patients with T2D and showed a good tolerability and safety profile."
https://openalex.org/W4280561770,"HIV-1 therapy with single or dual broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) has shown viral escape, indicating that at least a triple bNAb therapy may be needed for robust suppression of viremia. We performed a two-part study consisting of a single-center, randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation, placebo-controlled first-in-human trial of the HIV-1 V2-glycan-specific antibody PGDM1400 alone or in combination with the V3-glycan-specific antibody PGT121 in 24 adults without HIV in part 1, as well as a multi-center, open-label trial of the combination of PGDM1400, PGT121 and the CD4-binding-site antibody VRC07-523LS in five viremic adults living with HIV not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in part 2 ( NCT03205917 ). The primary endpoints were safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics for both parts and antiviral activity among viremic adults living with HIV and not on ART for part 2 of the study. The secondary endpoints were changes in CD4+ T cell counts and development of HIV-1 sequence variations associated with PGDM1400, PGT121 and VRC07-523LS resistance in part 2. Intravenously administered PGDM1400 was safe and well-tolerated at doses up to 30 mg kg-1 and when given in combination with PGT121 and VRC07-523LS. A single intravenous infusion of 20 mg kg-1 of each of the three antibodies reduced plasma HIV RNA levels in viremic individuals by a maximum mean of 2.04 log10 copies per ml; however, viral rebound occurred in all participants within a median of 20 days after nadir. Rebound viruses demonstrated partial to complete resistance to PGDM1400 and PGT121 in vitro, whereas susceptibility to VRC07-523LS was preserved. Viral rebound occurred despite mean VRC07-523LS serum concentrations of 93 µg ml-1. The trial met the pre-specified endpoints. Our data suggest that future bNAb combinations likely need to achieve broad antiviral activity, while also maintaining high serum concentrations, to mediate viral control."
https://openalex.org/W4280562645,"Abstract Metformin, the first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes (T2D), decreases hepatic glucose production and reduces fasting plasma glucose levels. Dorzagliatin, a dual-acting orally bioavailable glucokinase activator targeting both the pancreas and liver glucokinase, decreases postprandial glucose in patients with T2D. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, the efficacy and safety of dorzagliatin as an add-on therapy to metformin were assessed in patients with T2D who had inadequate glycemic control using metformin alone. Eligible patients with T2D ( n = 767) were randomly assigned to receive dorzagliatin or placebo (1:1 ratio) as an add-on to metformin (1,500 mg per day) for 24 weeks of double-blind treatment, followed by 28 weeks of open-label treatment with dorzagliatin for all patients. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels from baseline to week 24, and safety was assessed throughout the trial. At week 24, the least-squares mean change from baseline in HbA1c (95% confidence interval (CI)) was −1.02% (−1.11, −0.93) in the dorzagliatin group and −0.36% (−0.45, −0.26) in the placebo group (estimated treatment difference, −0.66%; 95% CI: −0.79, −0.53; P &lt; 0.0001). The incidence of adverse events was similar between groups. There were no severe hypoglycemia events or drug-related serious adverse events in the dorzagliatin and metformin combined therapy group. In patients with T2D who experienced inadequate glycemic control with metformin alone, dorzagliatin resulted in effective glycemic control with good tolerability and safety profile ( NCT03141073 )."

https://openalex.org/W4280580357,"There is a need to optimize closed-loop automated insulin delivery in type 1 diabetes. We assessed the glycemic efficacy and safety of empagliflozin 25 mg d-1 as add-on therapy to insulin delivery with a closed-loop system. We performed a 2 × 2 factorial randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover two-center trial in adults, assessing 4 weeks of closed-loop delivery versus sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy and empagliflozin versus placebo. The primary outcome was time spent in the glucose target range (3.9-10.0 mmol l-1). Primary comparisons were empagliflozin versus placebo in each of closed-loop or SAP therapy; the remaining comparisons were conditional on its significance. Twenty-four of 27 randomized participants were included in the final analysis. Compared to placebo, empagliflozin improved time in target range with closed-loop therapy by 7.2% and in SAP therapy by 11.4%. Closed-loop therapy plus empagliflozin improved time in target range compared to SAP therapy plus empagliflozin by 6.1% but by 17.5% for the combination of closed-loop therapy and empagliflozin compared to SAP therapy plus placebo. While no diabetic ketoacidosis or severe hypoglycemia occurred during any intervention, uncomplicated ketosis events were more common on empagliflozin. Empagliflozin 25 mg d-1 added to automated insulin delivery improves glycemic control but increases ketone concentration and ketosis compared to placebo."
https://openalex.org/W4280539527,"Cis-regulatory changes are key drivers of adaptative evolution. However, their contribution to the metabolic adaptation of organisms is not well understood. Here, we used a unique vertebrate model, Astyanax mexicanus-different morphotypes of which survive in nutrient-rich surface and nutrient-deprived cave waters-to uncover gene regulatory networks underlying metabolic adaptation. We performed genome-wide epigenetic profiling in the liver tissues of Astyanax and found that many of the identified cis-regulatory elements (CREs) have genetically diverged and have differential chromatin features between surface and cave morphotypes, while retaining remarkably similar regulatory signatures between independently derived cave populations. One such CRE in the hpdb gene harbors a genomic deletion in cavefish that abolishes IRF2 repressor binding and derepresses enhancer activity in reporter assays. Selection of this mutation in multiple independent cave populations supports its importance in cave adaptation, and provides novel molecular insights into the evolutionary trade-off between loss of pigmentation and adaptation to food-deprived caves."
https://openalex.org/W4280528310,"Ingestion of alkaloid metabolites from the bark of Galbulimima (GB) sp. leads to psychotropic and excitatory effects in humans1–4. Limited, variable supply of GB alkaloids5, however, has impeded their biological exploration and clinical development6. Here we report a solution to the supply of GB18, a structural outlier and putative psychotropic principle of Galbulimima bark. Efficient access to its challenging tetrahedral attached-ring motif required the development of a ligand-controlled endo-selective cross-electrophile coupling and a diastereoselective hydrogenation of a rotationally dynamic pyridine. Reliable, gram-scale access to GB18 enabled its assignment as a potent antagonist of κ- and μ-opioid receptors—the first new targets in 35 years—and lays the foundation to navigate and understand the biological activity of Galbulimima metabolites. A synthetic route to GB18, an alkaloid from the bark of hallucinogenic Galbulimima sp., is developed, enabling its identification as an antagonist of κ- and μ-opioid receptors."
https://openalex.org/W4280540825,"Background HIV Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has demonstrated efficacy and effectiveness among high-risk populations. In Thailand, PrEP has been included in the National Guidelines on HIV/AIDS Treatment and Prevention since 2014. As a part of the national monitoring and evaluation framework for Thailand’s universal coverage inclusion, this cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess knowledge of, attitudes to and practice (KAP) of PrEP service providers in Thailand. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey to explore knowledge of, and attitudes towards PrEP among providers from hospital and Key Population Led Health Services (KPLHS) settings. The questionnaire was distributed online in July 2020. Descriptive and univariate analysis using an independent-sample t-test were applied in the analyses. Attitudes were ranked from the most negative (score of 1) to the most positive (score of 5). Results Overall, there were 196 respondents (158 from hospitals and 38 from KPLHS) in which most hospital providers are female nurse practitioners while half of those from KPLHS report current gender as gay. Most respondents report a high level of PrEP knowledge and support provision in all high-risk groups with residual concern regarding anti-retroviral drugs resistance. Over two-fifths of providers from both settings perceive that PrEP would result in risk compensation and half of KPLHS providers are concerned regarding risk of sexual transmitted infections. Limited PrEP counselling time is a challenge for hospital providers. Conclusions Service integration between both settings, more involvement and distribution of KPLHS in reaching key populations would be essential in optimizing PrEP uptake and retention. Continuing support particularly in raising awareness about PrEP among healthcare providers and key populations, facilities and manpower, unlimited quota of patient recruitment and PrEP training to strengthen providers’ confidence and knowledge would be essential for successful PrEP implementation."

The possibility to reliably determine the number of truly infected persons, enabled us to study initial drivers for exposure risk in the absence of routine testing. Numerous activities or circumstances can accelerate virus spread, here defined as exposure factors. Hence, we aimed to evaluate a wide variety of demographic, behavioural and social exposure factors associated with seropositivity during the first eight months of the pandemic in Limburg, The Netherlands.SARS-CoV-2 point-seroprevalence was determined cross-sectionally to indicate previous infection in a convenience sample of minimal 10,000 inhabitants of the study province. All adult (18+ years) inhabitants of the study province were eligible to register themselves for participation. Once the initial 10,000 registrations were reached, a reserve list was kept to ensure sufficient participants. Possible exposure factors were mapped by means of an extensive questionnaire. Associated exposure factors were determined using univariable and multivariable logistic regression models.Seropositivity was established in 19.5% (n = 1,948) of the 10,001 participants (on average 49 years old (SD = 15; range 18-90 years), majority women (n = 5,829; 58.3%). Exposure factors associated with seropositivity included current education, working in healthcare and not working from home, and being a member of three or four associations or clubs. Specifically for February-March 2020, visiting an après-ski bar during winter sports in Austria, travelling to Spain, celebrating carnival, and participating in a singing activity or ball sport were associated with seropositivity.Our results confirm that relevant COVID-19 exposure factors generally reflected circumstances where social distancing was impossible, and the number and duration of contacts was high, in particular for indoor activities."
https://openalex.org/W4280583841,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects more than 6 million people in Germany. Monitoring the vital parameters of COPD patients remotely through telemonitoring may help doctors and patients prevent and treat acute exacerbations of COPD, improving patients' quality of life and saving costs for the statutory health insurance system.To evaluate the effects from October 2012 until December 2015 of a structured home telemonitoring program implemented by a statutory health insurer in Germany.We conducted a retrospective cohort study using administrative data. After building a balanced control group using Entropy Balancing, we calculated difference-in-difference estimators to account for time-invariant heterogeneity. We estimated differences in mortality rates using Cox regression and conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses to check the robustness of the base case results. We observed each patient in the program for up to 3 years depending on his or her time of enrolment.Among patients in the telemonitoring cohort, we observed significantly higher inpatient costs due to COPD (€524.2, p<0,05; €434.6, p<0.05) and outpatient costs (102.5, p<0.01; 78.8 p<0.05) during the first two years of the program. Additional cost categories were significantly increased during the first year of telemonitoring. We also observed a significantly higher number of drug prescriptions during all three years of the observation period (2.0500, p < 0.05; 0.7260, p < 0.05; 3.3170, p < 0.01) and a higher number of outpatient contacts during the first two years (0.945, p<0.01, 0.683, p<0.05). Furthermore, we found significantly improved survival rates for participants in the telemonitoring program (HR 0.68, p<0.001).On one hand, telemonitoring was associated with higher health care expenditures, especially in the first year of the program. For example, we were able to identify a statistically significant increase in inpatient costs due to COPD, outpatient contacts and drug prescriptions among individuals participating in the telemonitoring program. On the other hand, the telemonitoring program was accompanied by a survival benefit, which might be related to higher adherence rates, more intense treatment, or an improved understanding of COPD among these patients."
https://openalex.org/W4280629306,"The COVID-19 pandemic is far from over, in part due to poor adoption of public health mitigation measures in the U.S. and the continued spread of the Delta and Omicron variants. Current public health messaging used in the U.S. could be improved to better combat mistrust about COVID-19 and its mitigation measures, especially vaccines. We propose that a disgust-inducing public health campaign will be more effective than current approaches, primarily among conservatives, who are both sensitive to moralized disgust and are less compliant with U.S. public health guidelines. Using a convenience sample across two studies (n = 1610), we found that presenting disgusting images related to the COVID-19 pandemic increased public health compliance more among conservatives than among liberals. Among unvaccinated conservative participants, disgusting images significantly increased willingness to be vaccinated compared to less disgusting images of COVID-19 or perks offered for COVID-19 vaccines. Using disgusting images for public health messaging has the potential to improve compliance among conservatives and accelerate the end of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S."
https://openalex.org/W4280514564,"Amaranth (Amaranthus spp.) is a highly nutritious, underutilized vegetable and pseudo-cereal crop. It possesses diverse abiotic stress tolerance traits, is genetically diverse and highly phenotypically plastic, making it an ideal crop to thrive in a rapidly changing climate. Despite considerable genetic diversity there is a lack of detailed characterization of germplasm or population structures. The present study utilized the DArTSeq platform to determine the genetic relationships and population structure between 188 amaranth accessions from 18 agronomically important vegetable, grain, and weedy species. A total of 74, 303 SNP alleles were generated of which 63, 821 were physically mapped to the genome of the grain species A. hypochondriacus. Population structure was inferred in two steps. First, all 188 amaranth accessions comprised of 18 species and second, only 120 A. tricolor accessions. After SNP filtering, a total of 8,688 SNPs were generated on 181 amaranth accessions of 16 species and 9,789 SNPs generated on 118 A. tricolor accessions. Both SNP datasets produced three major sub-populations (K = 3) and generate consistent taxonomic classification of the amaranth sub-genera (Amaranthus Amaranthus, Amaranthus Acnida and Amaranthus albersia), although the accessions were poorly demarcated by geographical origin and morphological traits. A. tricolor accessions were well discriminated from other amaranth species. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 10 qualitative traits revealed an association between specific phenotypes and genetic variants within the genome and identified 22 marker trait associations (MTAs) and 100 MTAs (P≤0.01, P≤0.001) on 16 amaranth species and 118 A.tricolor datasets, respectively. The release of SNP markers from this panel has produced invaluable preliminary genetic information for phenotyping and cultivar improvement in amaranth species."
https://openalex.org/W4280525146,"This prospective, open-label, multicentre, multinational, randomised trial investigated the non-inferiority of treatment with a vaginal hormone-free moisturising cream compared to a vaginal estriol (0.1%) cream in a panel of post-menopausal women suffering from symptoms of vulvovaginal dryness in a parallel group design. In total, 172 post-menopausal women were randomly allocated to either one of the two treatments, each administered for 43 days. The primary endpoint was the total severity score of subjective symptoms (dryness, itching, burning and pain unrelated to sexual intercourse) of the respective treatment period. Secondary endpoints were severity of single subjective symptoms (including dyspareunia if sexually active), impairment of daily life, Vaginal Health Index, as well as assessment of safety. In both groups, women treated with hormone-free moisturising cream and those treated with estriol cream, total severity score improved significantly compared to baseline by 5.0 (from 6.1 to 1.1) and by 5.4 (from 6.0 to 0.6), respectively, after 43 days of treatment (p < 0.0001). One-sided test of baseline differences (for a clinically relevant difference Δ = 1.5) confirmed the hormone-free moisturising cream to be non-inferior to the estriol cream. Severity of dyspareunia as well as impairment of daily life due to subjective symptoms, significantly improved for both treatment groups (p<0.0001). Subgroup analysis of women with mild or moderate impairment of daily life at baseline caused by ""vaginal dryness"" symptoms benefited from both creams, while women with severe impairment showed a significantly greater benefit from the estriol cream (p = 0.0032). Both treatments were well tolerated with no serious adverse events occurring. This study provides clinical evidence that a hormone-free vaginal moisturising cream cannot only improve vaginal dryness compared to an 0.1% estriol cream but also can relieve dyspareunia as well as improve woman's impairment of daily life, justifying its use as a first choice for mild or moderate vulvovaginal dryness symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W4280555187,"Male partner awareness and acceptance of microbicide and family planning product use has been shown to increase women's own acceptance and adherence of a product. However, little is known about preferences regarding potential Multipurpose Prevention Technology (MPT) product delivery forms. As part of the TRIO study, men's reactions to their female partner's TRIO product use and comparisons of men's and women's views of TRIO product attributes and use acceptability were explored to better understand product preferences.Women in TRIO used three placebo products that represented potential MPTs: daily oral tablets, monthly vaginal rings, and monthly dual injections. Male partners (N = 39) and women (N = 88) completed in-depth interviews on their own and their partner's experiences with these products. Qualitative coding and analyses followed a conceptual model of HIV prevention product acceptability, and here, we explored themes of disclosure, trust and infidelity as they informed barriers and facilitators to product use.Men expressed a desire to know of their partner's product use decisions and be informed and educated on the products to better support their partners, in some cases, expressing a high level of concern regarding maximizing the ease of product adherence for their partner. They also wanted to understand the effects of products on sexual encounters with their partner, but in some cases, wanted more knowledge in order to control their partner's product use decisions. Similarly to women, men found long-acting, discreet products that have little to no effect on sexual encounters or libido the most acceptable for their female partners' use. Product use was most acceptable to men if they were informed of use without inadvertent discovery.Men's product attribute preferences often aligned with women's opinions of the same products. To support women's correct use of MPTs, further research is needed to determine the best strategy for achieving male partner acceptance and support of product use, particularly for less familiar delivery forms, such as the vaginal ring."
https://openalex.org/W4280638446,"The synthetic indices are widely used to describe balance and stability during gait. Some of these are employed to describe the gait features in Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the results are sometimes inconsistent, and the same indices are rarely used to compare the individuals affected by PD before and after levodopa intake (OFF and ON condition, respectively). Our aim was to investigate which synthetic measure among Harmonic Ratio, Jerk Ratio, Golden Ratio and Trunk Displacement Index is representative of gait stability and harmony, and which of these are more sensitive to the variations between OFF and ON condition. We found that all indices, except the Jerk Ratio, significantly improve after levodopa. Only the improvement of the Trunk Displacement Index showed a direct correlation with the motor improvement measured through the clinical scale UPDRS-III (Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale–part III). In conclusion, we suggest that the synthetic indices can be useful to detect motor changes induced by, but not all of them clearly correlate with the clinical changes achieved with the levodopa administration. In our analysis, only the Trunk Displacement Index was able to show a clear relationship with the PD clinical motor improvement."

Partial S, M, and L segment sequences of the CCHFV genome were obtained from 500 serum samples from CCHF patients and 103 pools of ticks collected in the south of the European region of Russia in 2007-2017. The investigated viral strains belonged to the lineages Europe 1 (596 samples), Africa 3 (1 sample) and a new genetic lineage, Europe 3 (6 samples). The Russian CCHFV strains of the Europe 1 lineage formed four subgroups (Va-Vd) correlated with the geographical site of virus isolation. Segment reassortment events between strains of different subgroups within lineage Europe 1 were revealed. The complete S, M and L genome segments of 18 CCHFV strains belonging to different subgroups of the Europe 1 lineage and the complete S segments of 3 strains of the Europe 3 lineage and 1 strain of the Africa 3 lineage were sequenced. The analysis of the geographical distribution of CCHFV genetic variants in southern Russia revealed local viral populations with partially overlapping boundaries."
https://openalex.org/W4280547734,"Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), a monopartite begomovirus in the family Geminiviridae, is efficiently transmitted by the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, and causes serious economic losses to tomato crops around the world. TYLCV-infected tomato plants develop distinctive symptoms of yellowing and leaf upward cupping. In recent years, excellent progress has been made in the characterization of TYLCV C4 protein function as a pathogenicity determinant in experimental plants, including Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the molecular mechanism leading to disease symptom development in the natural host plant, tomato, has yet to be characterized. The aim of the current study was to generate transgenic tomato plants expressing the TYLCV C4 gene and evaluate differential gene expression through comparative transcriptome analysis between the transgenic C4 plants and the transgenic green fluorescent protein (Gfp) gene control plants. Transgenic tomato plants expressing TYLCV C4 developed phenotypes, including leaf upward cupping and yellowing, that are similar to the disease symptoms expressed on tomato plants infected with TYLCV. In a total of 241 differentially expressed genes identified in the transcriptome analysis, a series of plant development-related genes, including transcription factors, glutaredoxins, protein kinases, R-genes and microRNA target genes, were significantly altered. These results provide further evidence to support the important function of the C4 protein in begomovirus pathogenicity. These transgenic tomato plants could serve as basic genetic materials for further characterization of plant receptors that are interacting with the TYLCV C4."
https://openalex.org/W4280588559,"HGFR activation drives the malignant progression of colorectal cancer, and its inhibition displays anti-autophagic activity. The interrelated role of HGFR inhibition and TLR9/autophagy signaling in HT29 cancer cells subjected to modified self-DNA treatments has not been clarified. We analyzed this complex interplay with cell metabolism and proliferation measurements, TLR9, HGFR and autophagy inhibitory assays and WES Simple Western blot-based autophagy flux measurements, gene expression analyses, immunocytochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy. The overexpression of MyD88 and caspase-3 was associated with enhanced HT29 cell proliferation, suggesting that incubation with self-DNAs could suppress the apoptosis-induced compensatory cell proliferation. HGFR inhibition blocked the proliferation-reducing effect of genomic and hypermethylated, but not that of fragmented DNA. Lowest cell proliferation was achieved with the concomitant use of genomic DNA, HGFR inhibitor, and chloroquine, when the proliferation stimulating effect of STAT3 overexpression could be outweighed by the inhibitory effect of LC3B, indicating the putative involvement of HGFR-mTOR-ULK1 molecular cascade in HGFR inhibitor-mediated autophagy. The most intense cell proliferation was caused by the co-administration of hypermethylated DNA, TLR9 and HGFR inhibitors, when decreased expression of both canonical and non-canonical HGFR signaling pathways and autophagy-related genes was present. The observed ultrastructural changes also support the context-dependent role of HGFR inhibition and autophagy on cell survival and proliferation. Further investigation of the influence of the studied signaling pathways and cellular processes can provide a basis for novel, individualized anti-cancer therapies."

https://openalex.org/W4280629048,"This study aimed to evaluate the relevant factors of postoperative avascular necrosis of the femoral head (AVN) in children with femoral neck fracture. This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 28 children with femoral neck fractures treated at our center between July 2016 and January 2019. The average age was 9.3 (range, 4.4-14) years with 75% male participants. Fracture classification was based on the Delbet classification: there were four, seven, 15, and two cases of type I, II, III, and IV fractures, respectively. Displacement degree was based on the Garden classification. Sixteen cases had insignificant displacement (Garden types I and II), six had medium displacement (Garden type III), and six had significant displacement (Garden type IV). There were six early (≤24 hours) and 22 delayed (>24 hours) surgeries. Twenty-three patients had satisfactory reduction, and five had unsatisfactory reduction. The mean postoperative follow-up period was 15.7 (range, 12-36) months. Follow-up was evaluated using the Ratliff scoring standards. The correlation between age, fracture classification, displacement degree, surgery timing, reduction quality, and other factors and AVN occurrence was statistically analyzed. Among 28 children, AVN was found in six cases. There were statistically significant differences in displacement degree (P = 0.001) and reduction quality (P = 0.001), while the occurrence of AVN did not significantly differ with sex (P = 0.117), age distribution (P = 0.218), fracture classification (P = 0.438), surgery timing (P = 0.255), and mechanism of injury (P = 0.436). The results of logistic regression analysis showed that displacement degree was a relevant risk factor (P = 0.049, odds ratio [OR] = 8.391, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.004-70.117), while reduction quality was not (P = 0.075, OR = 14.536, 95% CI: 0.757-278.928). Although the development of AVN in children with femoral neck fractures may be related to many factors, the results of this research suggest that there is a significant correlation between displacement degree and AVN occurrence."
https://openalex.org/W4280633316,"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women worldwide, accordingly, numerous chemotherapeutic drugs have been discovered thus far. However, the development and application of these drugs is severely constrained because of their unclear mechanism. To address this issue, our previous work has defined 3-acyl isoquinolin-1(2 H )-one derivatives as potent anti-tumor agents, among which the compound 4f possessed relatively higher activity in vitro . In this study, we aim to further explore the anti-cancer effect and the underlying molecular mechanism of 4f in breast cancer cells. Therefore, CCK8 assay was used to detect cell viability and flow cytometry was used to analyze cell cycle and apoptosis. Meanwhile, related proteins that regulate cell cycle and apoptosis were detected. The results showed that 4f induced cell apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation in breast cancer cells in a dose-depended manner without significant toxicity to human normal mammary epithelial cell. The cell cycle was arrested at G2 phase with the suppressed expression of the CDK1 protein. Additionally, 4f was confirmed to induce the cell apoptosis with the up-regulation of bax, down-regulation of bcl-2, activation of cleaved-caspase3/7/9 and cleaved-PARP, together with the inhibition of MEK/ERK and p38 MAPK pathway. Moreover, the GSDME-mediated pyroptosis was also induced by 4f in breast cancer cells. Together, these results demonstrated that 4f could serve as a new and promising candidate for the treatment of breast cancer."

The study aimed at identifying and exploring the bottlenecks in MNH services in Hard-to-reach (HtR) areas of Bangladesh using the Tanahashi framework exploring the possible remedial approaches. The study was conducted in four different types of HtR areas (hilly, coastal, lowlands, and river islands) by utilizing a sequential explanatory mixed-method design. Overall, we collected information from 20 health facilities and 2,989 households by interviewing 2,768 recently delivered women (RDW) with a structured questionnaire and qualitative interviews (n = 55) of facility managers, local stakeholders, RDWs, and health care providers (HCP). The quantitative data were analyzed principally for descriptive statistics and the qualitative data was analyzed by utilizing the thematic approach. Antenatal care, under-5 care, and family planning services were available in almost all the facilities. However, Normal vaginal deliveries were performed in 55.6% of the union-level facilities. Only 40% of sub-district level facilities had provision for C-sections. Blood transfusion services were available in only 20.1% of facilities, whereas laboratory services were obtainable in 51.7% of facilities. Overall, the bottlenecks were identified in cases of availability of drugs, human resources, transportation, lack of knowledge regarding different essential services and health components, out of pocket expenditure etc. There have been several remedial approaches suggested from both the demand and supply side that included incentives for care providers for staying in these areas, a coordinated transport/referral system, and health education campaigns. More research works are warranted in HtR areas, especially to test the proposed interventions. Meanwhile, the government should take the necessary steps to overcome the bottlenecks identified."
https://openalex.org/W4280552274,"Background Teams caring for people living with cancer face many difficult clinical situations that are compounded by the pandemic and can have serious consequences on professional and personal life. This study aims to better understand how a multi-component intervention builds resilience in oncology teams. The intervention is based on a salutogenic approach, theories and empirical research on team resilience at work. This intervention research involves partnership between researchers and stakeholders in defining situations of adversity and solutions appropriate to context. Methods The principles of realist evaluation are used to develop context-mechanism-outcome configurations of a multi-component intervention developed by researchers and field partners concerned with the resilience of oncology teams. The multiple case study involves oncology teams in natural contexts in four healthcare establishments in Québec (Canada). Qualitative and quantitative methods are employed. Qualitative data from individual interviews, group interviews and observation are analyzed using thematic content analysis. Quantitative data are collected through validated questionnaires measuring team resilience at work and its effect on teaming processes and cost-effectiveness. Integration of these data enables the elucidation of associations between intervention, context, mechanism and outcome. Discussion The study will provide original data on contextual factors and mechanisms that promote team resilience in oncology settings. It suggests courses of action to better manage difficult situations that arise in a specialized care sector, minimize their negative effects and learn from them, during and after the waves of the pandemic. The mechanisms for problem resolution and arriving at realistic solutions to professional workforce and team effectiveness challenges can help improve practices in other settings."
https://openalex.org/W4280556069,"In the field of adolescent gambling prevention, there is a lack of intervention studies reporting and assessing training courses for the intervention providers. The present work fills this gap by realizing a dissemination study inside the PRIZE program aimed at modifying a set of cognitive protective factors and affective risk factors. The purpose of this work was twofold: To develop and evaluate a training course with the intervention providers (Study 1), and to assess the short- and long-term effects of the intervention itself (Study 2). The training course was delivered to 44 health professionals (32 females, M age = 39.34 years). Results showed a significant increase of correct knowledge about gambling and a significant reduction of their susceptibility to probabilistic reasoning biases. Participants also actually learnt the main competencies to conduct the educational activities, they were satisfied for the training course received, and they felt high levels of self-efficacy. The intervention was implemented with 1894 high school students (61% males; M age = 15.68 years). In the short term, we found a significant increase of adolescents’ correct gambling knowledge, random events knowledge, and probabilistic reasoning ability, and a significant decrease of superstitious thinking, monetary positive outcome expectation, and gambling-related erroneous thoughts and fallacious behavioral choices. In the long-term, a significant decrease of gambling frequency, gambling versatility, and gambling problem severity was obtained. Overall, this work highlights the importance to train prevention program providers in order to optimize the effectiveness of large-scale gambling intervention programs towards adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W4280585321,"Few studies have examined the stability of the pulmonary mycobiome. We report longitudinal changes in the oral and pulmonary mycobiome of participants with and without COPD in a large-scale bronchoscopy study (MicroCOPD).Repeated sampling was performed in 30 participants with and 21 without COPD. We collected an oral wash (OW) and a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample from each participant at two time points. The internal transcribed spacer 1 region of the ribosomal RNA gene cluster was PCR amplified and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq sequencer. Differences in taxonomy, alpha diversity, and beta diversity between the two time points were compared, and we examined the effect of intercurrent antibiotic use.Sample pairs were dominated by Candida. We observed less stability in the pulmonary taxonomy compared to the oral taxonomy, additionally emphasised by a higher Yue-Clayton measure in BAL compared to OW (0.69 vs 0.22). No apparent effect was visually seen on taxonomy from intercurrent antibiotic use or participant category. We found no systematic variation in alpha diversity by time either in BAL (p-value 0.16) or in OW (p-value 0.97), and no obvious clusters on bronchoscopy number in PCoA plots. Pairwise distance analyses showed that OW samples from repeated sampling appeared more stable compared to BAL samples using the Bray-Curtis distance metric (p-value 0.0012), but not for Jaccard.Results from the current study propose that the pulmonary mycobiome is less stable than the oral mycobiome, and neither COPD diagnosis nor intercurrent antibiotic use seemed to influence the stability."
https://openalex.org/W4280590416,"Previous comparative studies show that triple Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) (i.e. phacoemulsification followed immediately by DMEK) has either equivalent or better visual outcomes than DMEK in pseudophakic patients. To resolve this discrepancy, a retrospective cohort study was conducted. All consecutive patients with Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy who underwent triple or pseudophakic DMEK in 2015–2019 in a tertiary-care hospital (France) and were followed for &gt;12 months were compared in terms of best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), final refractive outcomes, and endothelial-cell loss at 12 months as well as rebubbling rates. The triple-DMEK (40 eyes, 34 patients) and pseudophakic-DMEK (55 eyes, 43 patients) groups were similar in terms of age and other baseline variables. They also did not differ in final BSCVA (both 0.03 logMAR), final endothelial-cell loss (54% vs. 48%), or astigmatism (-1.25 vs. -1 D). At 12 months, triple-DMEK associated with significantly smaller residual hyperopia (0.75 vs. 1 D; p = 0.04) and spherical equivalence (0 vs. 0.5 D; p = 0.02). Triple-DMEK also tended to associate with more frequent rebubbling (40% vs. 24%, p = 0.09). In conclusion, while triple-DMEK and pseudophakic-DMEK achieved similar visual acuity improvement, triple-DMEK was superior in terms of final sphere and spherical refraction but also tended to have higher complication rates."
https://openalex.org/W4280595393,"Identifying and ensuring the Essential Public Health Functions (EPHFs) is one of the core agendas of the World Health Organization to strengthen the health system of a country. The definition of EPHFs varies widely, considering country needs. In Bangladesh, the physician cadres are in the leadership position to oversee the EPHFs at the district and sub-district levels. However, there is a dearth of contextual information regarding the purview of essential EPHFs in the country. The purpose of this study was to document the perception of key stakeholders on what constitute the EPHFs at district and sub-district level and identify the challenges they face in providing the services.We carried out a qualitative exploratory study consisting of document review and Key Informant Interviews (KIIs). The desk review included the organograms of the government district and sub-district level health facilities and the job description of Civil Surgeons (CSs) and Upazila Health and Family Planning Officers (UHFPOs). In addition, 15 KIIs with relevant professionals and stakeholders from the Directorate of General of Health Services (DGHS), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) were conducted. Collected data were analyzed thematically.Three major categories of EPHFs were identified: i) population-oriented preventive functions, ii) clinical preventive functions, and iii) administrative/management functions. The CSs and UHFPOs need to ensure these wide range of EPHFs at the district level and below. However, at peripheral level, the leadership positions' clinical and public health roles often get amalgamated. Therefore, ensuring public health functions are hampered. Besides, these positions need training and adequate support staff to perform the EPHFs effectively.Recognizing the EPHFs in the Bangladesh context is crucial. Revisiting the job descriptions and strengthening appropriate public health services at different tiers in the country health system should be prioritized to achieve health-related Sustainable Development Goals."
https://openalex.org/W4280597338,"Prior to direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), HCV incidence rose among men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV infection in Germany despite high hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment rates. We establish a HCV elimination modeling framework to evaluate whether existing treatment rates can achieve the World Health Organization (WHO) incidence target among MSM living with HIV in Germany.To evaluate progress towards HCV elimination in Germany, we adapted a previously published HCV transmission model among MSM living with diagnosed HIV. We modelled HCV incidence and prevalence until 2030 (relative to 2015) under existing treatment and DAA scale-up and explored potential impacts of disruptions in treatment and behavioral risk reduction due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Continuing current treatment rates will result in stable HCV incidence among MSM living with HIV in Germany between 2015-2030. The WHO HCV incidence target is achievable under DAA scale-up to 100% treatment combined with treatment of those previously diagnosed and untreated (at a rate of 15%/year) and would result in greater reductions with early treatment (3 vs 6 months) reducing incidence from 4.0/100person-years to 0.8/100person-years by 2030. A 12-month disruption to HCV treatment (20% reduction) and risk behaviors (25%,50%,75% reduction) during the COVID-19 pandemic would result in a 15% relative increase in total HCV incidence in 2030 compared to that expected under the status quo.HCV elimination among MSM living with HIV in Germany requires further DAA scale-up among those newly diagnosed combined with efforts to treat those previously diagnosed but untreated. Prospective monitoring will establish whether Germany is on track for HCV microelimination."

The online Movement, Interaction and Nutrition for Greater Lifestyles in the Elderly (MINGLE) program is a holistic evidence-based intervention aiming to support people with AMD by incorporating physical activity, social interaction and nutrition education components all delivered via a COVID-19-safe Zoom platform. This study will involve two phases: 1) a formative qualitative study with AMD patients to identify the barriers and facilitators to participating in the proposed MINGLE program; and 2) a 10-week pilot study to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of MINGLE. Methods and analysis Phase 1 involves AMD patients who will be recruited from an eye clinic in Western Sydney, Australia to participate in audio-recorded semi-structured interviews. Verbatim interview transcripts will be coded using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour (COM-B) model and themes established. These themes will be used as a guide to specifically tailor the proposed MINGLE program to people with AMD. Phase 2 involves 52 AMD patients who will then be recruited from the same clinic to participate in the MINGLE program. Pre-post questionnaires will be administered to intervention participants to collect information on the following variables: demographics, socioeconomic status, vision function, loneliness, quality of life (including depression), falls risk, physical activity (level), and dietary intake. The acceptability and feasibility of the MINGLE program will also be evaluated using descriptive statistics. Trial registration number ACTRN12621000939897p."
https://openalex.org/W4280535629,"Creating a proper career program is the best way to enhance employees' organizational commitment; it motivates and retains them. This research aims to measure career growth's influence on turnover intention, mediated by employees' commitment through self-reported employees' perceptions. This study identifies the key dimensions of organizational commitment (affective, continuance and normative commitment) that mediate the relationship between career growth and employee turnover intention exploring the indirect effects between career growth and turnover intention. The relationship is examined among the public sector employees in the Sultanate of Oman, a sector currently facing high turnover rates and losing key skilled talent pool.Data collection was executed through an adopted questionnaire distributed among 500 employees of 38 government units within the Sultanate of Oman. A total of 351 questionnaires were returned, and after the initial screening process, 329 were found to be valid for further analysis. CFA analysis was conducted to identify the factors falling under the three primary constructs of the study. Assessment of the models was explained through Goodness-of-fit Indices. Structural equation modeling, which is most recommended to study the effect of latent variables, was performed using AMOS to evaluate the mediating role of organizational commitment between career growth and employee turnover intention.The results indicated that the potential for career growth is an essential motivating element for public sector employees in the Sultanate of Oman to encourage retention and reduce intention to leave. The findings also confirm that effective and continuous commitment significantly mediates the relationship between career growth and employees' turnover intention.The results generated could help both researchers and those involved in public sector policy-making to understand how employee turnover intention is influenced by career growth and organizational commitment in the public sector in the Sultanate of Oman."
https://openalex.org/W4280538670,"Animals seem to rely on antipredator behavior to avoid vehicle collisions. There is an extensive body of antipredator behavior theory that have been used to predict the distance/time animals should escape from predators. These models have also been used to guide empirical research on escape behavior from vehicles. However, little is known as to whether antipredator behavior models are appropriate to apply to an approaching high-speed vehicle scenario. We addressed this gap by (a) providing an overview of the main hypotheses and predictions of different antipredator behavior models via a literature review, (b) exploring whether these models can generate quantitative predictions on escape distance when parameterized with empirical data from the literature, and (c) evaluating their sensitivity to vehicle approach speed using a simulation approach wherein we assessed model performance based on changes in effect size with variations in the slope of the flight initiation distance (FID) vs. approach speed relationship. The slope of the FID vs. approach speed relationship was then related back to three different behavioral rules animals may rely on to avoid approaching threats: the spatial, temporal, or delayed margin of safety. We used literature on birds for goals (b) and (c). Our review considered the following eight models: the economic escape model, Blumstein's economic escape model, the optimal escape model, the perceptual limit hypothesis, the visual cue model, the flush early and avoid the rush (FEAR) hypothesis, the looming stimulus hypothesis, and the Bayesian model of escape behavior. We were able to generate quantitative predictions about escape distance with the last five models. However, we were only able to assess sensitivity to vehicle approach speed for the last three models. The FEAR hypothesis is most sensitive to high-speed vehicles when the species follows the spatial (FID remains constant as speed increases) and the temporal margin of safety (FID increases with an increase in speed) rules of escape. The looming stimulus effect hypothesis reached small to intermediate levels of sensitivity to high-speed vehicles when a species follows the delayed margin of safety (FID decreases with an increase in speed). The Bayesian optimal escape model reached intermediate levels of sensitivity to approach speed across all escape rules (spatial, temporal, delayed margins of safety) but only for larger (> 1 kg) species, but was not sensitive to speed for smaller species. Overall, no single antipredator behavior model could characterize all different types of escape responses relative to vehicle approach speed but some models showed some levels of sensitivity for certain rules of escape behavior. We derive some applied applications of our findings by suggesting the estimation of critical vehicle approach speeds for managing populations that are especially susceptible to road mortality. Overall, we recommend that new escape behavior models specifically tailored to high-speeds vehicles should be developed to better predict quantitatively the responses of animals to an increase in the frequency of cars, airplanes, drones, etc. they will face in the next decade."
https://openalex.org/W4280541425,"Purpose Vocal exertion is common and often results in reduced respiratory and laryngeal efficiency. It is unknown, however, whether the respiratory kinematic and acoustic adjustments employed during vocal exertion differ between speakers reporting vocal fatigue and those who do not. This study compared respiratory kinematics and acoustic measures in individuals reporting low and high levels of vocal fatigue during a vocal exertion task. Methods Individuals reporting low (N = 20) and high (N = 10) vocal fatigue participated in a repeated measures design study over 2 days. On each day, participants completed a 10-minute vocal exertion task consisting of repeated, loud vowel productions at elevated F0 sustained for maximum phonation time. Respiratory kinematic and acoustic measures were analyzed on the 1 st vowel production (T0), and the vowels produced 2 minutes (T2), 5 minutes (T5), 7 minutes (T7), and 10 minutes (T10) into the vocal exertion task. Vowel durations were also measured at each time point. Results No differences in respiratory kinematics were observed between low and high vocal fatigue groups at T0. As the vocal exertion task progressed (T2-T10), individuals reporting high vocal fatigue initiated phonation at lower lung volumes while individuals with low vocal fatigue initiated phonation at higher lung volumes. As the exertion task progressed, total lung volume excursion decreased in both groups. Differences in acoustic measures were observed, as individuals reporting high vocal fatigue produced softer, shorter vowels from T0 through T10. Conclusions Individuals reporting high vocal fatigue employed less efficient respiratory strategies during periods of increased vocal demand when compared with individuals reporting low vocal fatigue. Individuals reporting high vocal fatigue had shorter maximum phonation time on loud vowels. Further study should examine the potential screening value of loud maximum phonation time, as well as the clinical implications of the observed respiratory patterns for managing vocal fatigue."
https://openalex.org/W4280588597,"Background Interpretation of clinical trial results testing vaginal microbicide gels for HIV prevention depends on participant adherence. Prior to the era of antiretrovirals, microbicide trials collected adherence data via self-report, and trials typically reported trial population adherence as overall averages in primary results manuscripts. This study first sought to determine if different patterns of adherence from three trials of vaginal microbicide gels could be identified, using self-reported data and if so, how those patterns compare across trials. The second objective was to explore which individual-level factors were associated with different adherence patterns. Methods Data from the following three clinical trials of vaginal microbicides were used for this study: HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 035 testing PRO 2000 and Buffergel, the Microbicides Development Programme (MDP) 301 testing PRO 2000, and the Population Council’s Carraguard study, testing Carraguard gel. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was used to identify longitudinal patterns of adherence using self-reported data about gel use. Multinomial multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate relative risk-ratios for factors which were independently associated with different latent adherence trajectories within each trial, and compared across trials. Results Included in this analysis are 2,282 women from HPTN 035 (age 17–56 years), 6238 women from MDP 301 (age 16–75 years), and 6039 women from Carraguard (age 16–73 years). Using LCA, 3–4 different patterns of gel adherence were identified in each trial; these patterns were similar across the trials. Factors associated with adherence patterns were identified in all trials. Older age was associated with the adherence trajectory that consistently reported gel use in three trials. Participant-reported negative reaction of partners to the gel was associated with trajectories that reported less consistent adherence in two trials. A greater number of baseline-reported sex partners or sex acts was associated with trajectories which reported less consistent adherence in some trials. Trial site location was associated with membership of trajectories in all trials. Conclusion LCA was able to identify patterns of microbicide gel adherence in clinical trials that used self-reported data. Key factors associated with patterns of adherence in this study were participant age, clinical trial site location, and partner reaction to the study gel. These findings, in particular, age and perceived partner reaction to the method, are consistent with results from other clinical trials and programmatic rollout of biomedical HIV prevention methods for women in Africa. This study contributes to the body of evidence that women need more support to navigate power dynamics within their relationships with men so that they can successfully use HIV prevention methods."
https://openalex.org/W4280599292,"Background The study objectives were to measure disability prevalence and severity, and examine disability risk factors, among adults living with HIV in London, United Kingdom (UK). Methods Self-reported questionnaires were administered: World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS), HIV Disability Questionnaire (HDQ), Equality Act disability definition (EADD), and demographic questionnaire. We calculated proportion (95% Confidence Interval; CI) of “severe” and “moderate” disability measured using EADD and WHODAS scores ≥2 respectively. We measured disability severity with HDQ domain severity scores. We used demographic questionnaire responses to assess risk factors of “severe” and “moderate” disability using logistic regression analysis, and HDQ severity domain scores using linear regression analysis. Results Of 201 participants, 176 (87.6%) identified as men, median age 47 years, and 194 (96.5%) virologically suppressed. Severe disability prevalence was 39.5% (n = 79/201), 95% CI [32.5%, 46.4%]. Moderate disability prevalence was 70.5% (n = 141/200), 95% CI [64.2%, 76.8%]. Uncertainty was the most severe HDQ disability domain. Late HIV diagnosis was a risk factor for severe disability [Odds Ratio (OR) 2.71; CI 1.25, 5.87]. Social determinants of health, economic inactivity [OR 2.79; CI 1.08, 7.21] and receiving benefits [OR 2.87; CI 1.05, 7.83], were risk factors for “severe” disability. Economic inactivity [OR 3.14; CI 1.00, 9.98] was a risk factor for “moderate” disability. Economic inactivity, receiving benefits, and having no fixed abode were risk factors ( P ≤0.05) for higher HDQ severity scores in physical, mental and emotional, difficulty with day-to-day activities, and challenges to social participation domains. Personal factors, identifying as a woman and being aged &lt;50 years, were risk factors ( P ≤0.05) for higher HDQ severity scores in mental and emotional, uncertainty, and challenges with social participation domains. Conclusions People living with well-controlled HIV in London UK experienced multi-dimensional and episodic disability. Results help to better understand the prevalence, severity, and risk factors of disability experienced by adults living with HIV, identify areas to target interventions, and optimise health and functioning."
https://openalex.org/W4280609746,"In commercial large-scale aquaria, controlling levels of nitrogenous compounds is essential for macrofauna health. Naturally occurring bacteria are capable of transforming toxic nitrogen species into their more benign counterparts and play important roles in maintaining aquaria health. Nitrification, the microbially-mediated transformation of ammonium and nitrite to nitrate, is a common and encouraged process for management of both commercial and home aquaria. A potentially competing microbial process that transforms ammonium and nitrite to dinitrogen gas (anaerobic ammonium oxidation [anammox]) is mediated by some bacteria within the phylum Planctomycetes. Anammox has been harnessed for nitrogen removal during wastewater treatment, as the nitrogenous end product is released into the atmosphere rather than in aqueous discharge. Whether anammox bacteria could be similarly utilized in commercial aquaria is an open question. As a first step in assessing the viability of this practice, we (i) characterized microbial communities from water and sand filtration systems for four habitats at the Tennessee Aquarium and (ii) examined the abundance and anammox potential of Planctomycetes using culture-independent approaches. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed distinct, yet stable, microbial communities and the presence of Planctomycetes (~1-15% of library reads) in all sampled habitats. Preliminary metagenomic analyses identified the genetic potential for multiple complete nitrogen metabolism pathways. However, no known genes diagnostic for the anammox reaction were found in this survey. To better understand the diversity of this group of bacteria in these systems, a targeted Planctomycete-specific 16S rRNA gene-based PCR approach was used. This effort recovered amplicons that share <95% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity to previously characterized Planctomycetes, suggesting novel strains within this phylum reside within aquaria."
https://openalex.org/W4280646826,"Objective To assess whether there is an association between veterinary specialty and the quality of life of residents in AVMA-Recognized Veterinary Specialty Organizations ™ using the WHOQOL-BREF instrument. Methods This cross-sectional study used an online survey and data collection service for administration of the survey to veterinary residents during April 2021 to June 2021. Veterinary residents were contacted through their respective AVMA-Recognized Veterinary Specialty Organization ™ and through social media. Overall quality of life along with the domains of Physical Health, Psychological Health, Social Relationships, and Environment were measured using the WHOQOL-BREF instrument. Additionally, data on the demographics of participants were collected and investigated as potential confounders. Mean standardized scores (0 to 100) were compared among the specialties using the general linear model. Results 792 residents from 21 veterinary specialties were included in the analysis. The results showed that overall quality of life and all four domains varied significantly among specialties after adjusting for significant demographic variables (all P s &lt; 0.001). The mean standardized overall quality of life score was 54.3, ranging from 31.8 in Emergency and Critical Care to 56.3 in Laboratory Animal. The mean standardized quality of life scores were lowest for Psychological Health (50.3), followed by Social Relationships (55.0), Environment (61.4), and Physical Health (62.6). Residents in Emergency and Critical Care had the lowest adjusted average scores in all quality of life domains. Residents in Internal Medicine, Anesthesia and Analgesia, and Surgeons had lower quality of life scores across several domains when compared to other specialties. Clinical relevance This study provides insight into the mental health and general well-being of veterinary residents. The results can assist veterinary specialty organizations, universities, and mentors in developing appropriate supporting programs for residents. The results can also assist residents in recognizing and more efficiently caring for their individual mental health and well-being."
https://openalex.org/W4280654593,"The number of prediction models developed for use in emergency departments (EDs) have been increasing in recent years to complement traditional triage systems.

https://openalex.org/W4280505421,"In this report we describe the embryogenesis of the bay pipefish, Syngnathus leptorhynchus , and the organogenesis of its aglomerular kidney. Early development was analyzed via a series of montages and images documenting embryos collected from the brood pouches of pregnant males. Despite differences in terminal morphology between pipefish and common teleost models such as medaka and zebrafish, the embryogenesis of these highly advanced fishes is generally similar to that of other fishes. One of the unique features of these fishes is their utilization of an aglomerular kidney. Histological analysis revealed a single long, unbranched kidney tubule in late embryos. The development and structure of this organ was further investigated by cloning the sodium potassium ATPase alpha subunit, atp1a, from S . leptorhynchus and developing whole mount fluorescent in situ hybridization protocols for embryos of this species. Fluorescent stereoscopic and confocal visualization techniques were then used to characterize the 3D morphology of aglomerular kidneys in intact embryos. In all embryonic stages characterized, the aglomerular kidney is a single unbranched tube extending from just behind the head to the cloaca."
https://openalex.org/W4280509318,"Family caregivers are a great resource for providing dignified end-of-life care for terminally ill patients. Framed from the perspective of role theory and the relational nature of providing and receiving care, study objectives were as follows: (1) to capture caregivers' understanding of the process of taking on the role of main caregiver, (2) to conceptualize their understanding of the functions that they assume while being the main caregivers, and (3) to understand how they experienced the consequences they confronted.The research team employed the methodological strategy of descriptive thematic analysis using a semi-structured interview guide. The sample consisting of 33 family caregivers was recruited using purposeful and snowball sampling strategies in 2020. Interview data was analyzed using content-driven inductive thematic analysis.The data analysis revealed four main themes that structure the process of becoming the main care giver of a terminally ill family member and the meaning of the caregiver role: (1) inaccessibility and mistrust of public care services for persons with terminal illness, (2) moral obligations and responsibilities of immediate family and friends, (3) cultural traditions, (4) the caregiver feels responsible for everything. The themes describe the social role of family caregiver in social context, address the process of taking on the role of caregiver and living with systemic corruption.Recognition of caregiving experiences is essential in planning better systems, in direct practice and in confronting corruption. The study suggests the need for open communication, accessibility of quality services, and the recognition of caregivers as care-team members. The larger implication is that the increasing numbers of distressed caregivers and aging populations can be considered as public health populations, and thus addressable through public health methods."
https://openalex.org/W4280512858,"This article considers the estimation of the stress-strength reliability parameter, θ = P ( X &lt; Y ), when both the stress ( X ) and the strength ( Y ) are dependent random variables from a Bivariate Lomax distribution based on a progressive type II censored sample. The maximum likelihood, the method of moments and the Bayes estimators are all derived. Bayesian estimators are obtained for both symmetric and asymmetric loss functions, via squared error and Linex loss functions, respectively. Since there is no closed form for the Bayes estimators, Lindley’s approximation is utilized to derive the Bayes estimators under these loss functions. An extensive simulation study is conducted to gauge the performance of the proposed estimators based on three criteria, namely, relative bias, mean squared error, and Pitman nearness probability. A real data application is provided to illustrate the performance of our proposed estimators through bootstrap analysis."
https://openalex.org/W4280523381,"We examined multi-level factors related to the longitudinal physical activity trajectories of adolescent girls to determine the important predictors for physical activity. The Trial of Activity in Adolescent Girls (TAAG) Maryland site recruited participants at age 14 ( n = 566) and followed up with these girls at age 17 ( n = 553) and age 23 ( n = 442). Individual, social factors and perceived environmental factors were assessed by questionnaire; body mass index was measured at age 14 and age 17, and self-reported at age 23. Neighborhood factors were assessed by geographic information systems. The outcome, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) minutes in a day, was assessed from accelerometers. A mixture of linear mixed-effects models with double penalization on fixed effects and random effects was used to identify the intrinsic grouping of participants with similar physical activity trajectory patterns and the most relevant predictors within the groups simultaneously. Three clusters of participants were identified. Two hundred and forty participants were clustered as “maintainers” and had consistently low MVPA over time; 289 participants were clustered as “decreasers” who had decreasing MVPA over time; 39 participants were grouped as “increasers” and had increasing MVPA over time. Each of the three clusters has its own cluster-specific factors identified using the clustering method, indicating that each cluster has unique characteristics."

https://openalex.org/W4280599805,"The spread of African swine fever (ASF) in Eurasia has forced a return to the development of live vaccines based on naturally or experimentally attenuated strains of the virus including those resulting from genetic manipulations. This process includes evaluation of the immunomodulating properties of the vaccines. In this report we provide our assessment of two tests for immunobiological evaluation of a candidate live vaccine against ASF from the attenuated ASF virus (ASFV) strain KK-202: (i) investigation of the effect of the attenuated ASFV strain KK-202 on the protectiveness of the vaccine ASFV strain FK-32/135 and a vaccine against classical swine fever (CSF) from the strain LK-VNIIVViM; (ii) determination of the phagocytic activity of blood neutrophils in pigs inoculated with ASFV strains differing in virulence. A simultaneous or sequential inoculation of attenuated strain KK-202 (seroimmunotype II) and vaccine strain FK-32/135 (seroimmunotype IV) into pigs resulted in the loss of protection against the virulent strain France-32 (seroimmunotype IV). Following the simultaneous or sequential inoculations of the ASFV strain KK-202 and the CSF virus (CSFV) vaccine produced from the strain LK-VNIIVViM, the neutralizing antibody titers against the CSFV observed in the experimental groups (after vaccination and after the challenge infection with the virulent CSFV strain Shimen) were not different from those found in animals of the control group. The phagocytic activity of blood neutrophils was shown to increase from 30% in the norm to 50%-94% depending on the virulence of the ASFV strains inoculated into pigs. The results of this work demonstrate the ability of the attenuated ASFV strains to modulate the development of the cellular link of protective immunity without negative impact on the humoral immune response. The informative value of the described immunobiological tests in vivo and in vitro seems to be a more preferable alternative in comparison to the commonly used in vitro tests, which do not always correlate with the development of protection against ASF."
https://openalex.org/W4280618200,"The aim of the article is to present the use of production function as a source of knowledge for managers of county hospitals to make rational decisions so as to achieve economic efficiency, including naturally the financial efficiency. The healthcare sector in each country differs from other sectors of the economy. The economically effective operation of county hospitals in Poland is very difficult due to all their determinants. Therefore, all economic analyses should be used to help hospital managers achieve this goal, and production function remains underestimated as a source of knowledge. The Cobb-Douglas and translog production functions were used as sources of knowledge for decision-making by county hospitals. Total number of patient-days was a dependent variable; and the total number of beds, the number of doctors and nurses (in full time equivalents, FTEs) and costs (of materials, electricity, services) were a set of explanatory variables. The significance of explanatory variables most often appeared in models accounting for the workload of nurses. On the other hand, the greatest fit measured with the residual standard error was characterised by models accounting for the number of beds. For each type of production function, the diversified results obtained show the properties of production function. This kind of knowledge is not provided by analyses which are not based on production functions."
https://openalex.org/W4280628589,"Background Currently, in Canada, existing health administrative data and hospital-inputted portal systems are used to measure the wait times to receiving a procedure or therapy after a specialist visit. However, due to missing and inconsistent labelling, estimating the wait time prior to seeing a specialist physician requires costly manual coding to label primary care referral notes. Methods In this work, we represent the notes using word-count vectors and develop a logistic regression machine learning model to automatically label the target specialist physician from a primary care referral note. These labels are not available in the administrative system. We also study the effects of note length (measured in number of tokens) and dataset size (measured in number of notes per target specialty) on model performance to help other researchers determine if such an approach may be feasible for them. We then calculate the wait time by linking the specialist type from a primary care referral to a full consultation visit held in Ontario, Canada health administrative data. Results For many target specialties, we can reliably ( F 1 Score ≥ 0.70) predict the target specialist type. Doing so enables the automated measurement of wait time from family physician referral to specialist physician visit. Of the six specialties with wait times estimated using both 2008 and 2015 data, two had a substantial increase (defined as a change such that the original value lay outside the 95% confidence interval) in both median and 75th percentile wait times, one had a substantial decrease in both median and 75th percentile wait times, and three has non-substantial increases. Conclusions Automating these wait time measurements, which had previously been too time consuming and costly to evaluate at a population level, can be useful for health policy researchers studying the effects of policy decisions on patient access to care."
https://openalex.org/W4280641338,"Flow (state of intense focus) during media use has been largely considered a desirable experience, with technologies developed to maximize the chance of encountering flow in computer-mediated environments. However, the total absorption of attention due to flow could be problematic in contexts where the user has multiple predetermined goals, and engaging with the flow-inducing media could cost them resources that may be otherwise devoted to other goals. When flow imposes a cost on the user's goal performance, it may also reduce their post-experience gratification with the flow-inducing media. The present study proposes a novel theoretical framework to begin understanding the potential cost of flow in media use with supporting evidence from two survey and vignette studies (N = 235 and N = 245). Its findings will extend human-computer interaction research by highlighting the double-edged impact that flow might have on media users' larger goal performance and downstream well-being."
