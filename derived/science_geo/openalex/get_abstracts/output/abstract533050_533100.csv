Analysis of Micro-C maps for budding yeast reveals abundant self-associating domains similar to those reported in other species, but not previously observed in yeast. These structures, far shorter than topologically associating domains in mammals, typically encompass one to five genes in yeast. Strong boundaries between self-associating domains occur at promoters of highly transcribed genes and regions of rapid histone turnover that are typically bound by the RSC chromatin-remodeling complex. Investigation of chromosome folding in mutants confirms roles for RSC, “gene looping” factor Ssu72, Mediator, H3K56 acetyltransferase Rtt109, and the N-terminal tail of H4 in folding of the yeast genome. This approach provides detailed structural maps of a eukaryotic genome, and our findings provide insights into the machinery underlying chromosome compaction.

Eukaryotic genomes are packaged into chromatin via a hierarchical series of folding steps. A great deal is known about the first level of chromatin compaction, as several crystal structures exist of the repeating subunit—the nucleosome—and genome-wide mapping studies have illuminated nucleosome positions and histone modifications across the genome for an ever-increasing number of organisms (Hughes and Rando, 2014Hughes A.L.

In contrast to the “primary structure” of chromatin, less is known about higher-order chromatin architecture. The next level of compaction is commonly thought to be the 30 nm fiber, which is readily observed by electron microscopy in vitro, but whose existence in vivo remains controversial (Fussner et al., 2011Fussner E.

The structure of a 30 nm fiber is hotly debated, with major models being solenoid and zigzag paths of the beads-on-a-string (Dorigo et al., 2004Dorigo B. Schalch T. Kulangara A. Duda S.

Moreover, mounting evidence suggests that 30 nm fiber may only occur in vitro due to the high dilution of chromatin fibers used in such studies—in dilute solution in vitro a given nucleosome will only have access to other nucleosomes on the same DNA fragment, while in the “sea of nucleosomes” in the nucleus many additional nucleosomes are available in trans for internucleosomal interactions (McDowall et al., 1986McDowall A.W.

Beyond the 30 nm fiber, multiple additional levels of organization have been described, with prominent examples including gene loops (Ansari and Hampsey, 2005Ansari A. Hampsey M.

The 3D path of chromatin has been implicated in a large number of biological processes, as for example gene loops are proposed to enforce promoter directionality in yeast (Tan-Wong et al., 2012Tan-Wong S.M.

Uslu V.V. Tsujimura T. Ruf S. Nassari S. Schwarzer W. Ettwiller L. Spitz F. Functional and topological characteristics of mammalian regulatory domains.Genome Res. 2014; 24: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and LADs are correlated with gene silencing during development (Pickersgill et al., 2006Pickersgill H. Kalverda B. de Wit E. Talhout W. Fornerod M. van Steensel B. Characterization of the Drosophila melanogaster genome at the nuclear lamina.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Understanding higher-order chromatin structure has been greatly facilitated by the 3C family of techniques (such as Hi-C), which assay contact frequency between genomic loci based on isolation of DNA fragments that crosslink to one another in vivo (Dekker et al., 2002Dekker J. Rippe K. Dekker M. Kleckner N. Capturing chromosome conformation.Science. 2002; 295: 1306-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (2518) Google Scholar). However, these techniques currently suffer from suboptimal resolution, as they rely on restriction digestion of the genome, typically yielding ∼4 kb average fragment size. Even with 4-cutter restriction enzymes, the heterogeneous distribution of restriction enzyme target sequences across the genome makes the resolution somewhat variable between individual loci of interest, and partial digestion still limits resolution to ∼1 kb at best. Thus, our present understanding of chromatin structure has a “blind spot,” with chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), micrococcal nuclease sequencing (MNase-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation exonuclease (ChIP-exo) methodologies providing information over the ∼1–150 bp length scale, and Hi-C typically providing information on the >1–4 kB length scale. This leaves the length scale relevant to secondary structures such as 30 nm fiber or yeast gene loops—on the order of approximately two to ten nucleosomes—inaccessible to current methods for analyzing chromosome structure. Here, we describe a Hi-C-based method—“Micro-C”—in which chromatin is fragmented into mononucleosomes using micrococcal nuclease, thus enabling nucleosome-resolution maps of chromosome folding. We generated high-coverage Micro-C maps for the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, finding abundant self-associating domains typically spanning one to five genes. Strong boundaries between self-associating domains occur at promoters of highly transcribed genes and regions of rapid histone turnover and are typically bound by the RSC ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex and by the cohesin loading complex. Finally, we investigate chromosome folding in detail in 14 mutants, confirming roles for RSC and Ssu72 in chromosome folding, and furthermore finding key roles for Mediator, the histone H4 N-terminal tail, and the H3K56 acetyltransferase Rtt109 in folding of the yeast genome. This approach thus enables analysis of chromosome folding at the resolution of chromatin’s repeating subunit—the nucleosome—and will enable future investigations into chromosome folding to leverage the powerful genetic tools available in the yeast model system. The resolution gap between 1D chromosome mapping assays (∼1–200 bp resolution) and 3D chromosome folding assays (>1 kb resolution) lead us to develop a Hi-C protocol—termed “Micro-C” for micrococcal nuclease chromosome conformation assay—in which chromatin fragmentation is achieved by MNase digestion, yielding mononucleosomes. This protocol is based on the Hi-C protocol (Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009Lieberman-Aiden E. van Berkum N.L. Williams L. Imakaev M. Ragoczy T. Telling A. Amit I. Lajoie B.R. Sabo P.J. Dorschner M.O. et al.Comprehensive mapping of long-range interactions reveals folding principles of the human genome.Science. 2009; 326: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (4868) Google Scholar), with key alterations being the MNase digestion step, subsequent mononucleosomal end repair, and a modified two-step method for specifically purifying ligation products (Figure 1A; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). After purification of ligation products between mononucleosomes, paired-end deep sequencing is used to characterize the ligation products. For some analyses, each pair mate is assigned to one of the 66,360 nucleosomes in budding yeast (Weiner et al., 2010Weiner A. Hughes A. Yassour M. Rando O.J. Friedman N. High-resolution nucleosome mapping reveals transcription-dependent promoter packaging.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) to yield a 66,360 × 66,360 nucleosome-nucleosome interaction matrix (Figures 1B and S1). Key technical controls include (1) sequencing of unligated samples, (2) ligation of MNase digestion reactions of uncrosslinked yeast, and (3) mixing of crosslinked chromatin from two yeast species (S. cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces lactis) prior to ligation to determine the rate of ligation between uncrosslinked molecules (Figures 1C and S1A; Tables S1 and S2). The post-crosslinking interspecies mixing experiment reveals that ∼10% of all interactions are spurious ligations at the dilution used.Figure S1Micro-C Signal Is Dependent on Crosslinking and Ligation Steps, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Micro-C data are shown for merged wild-type BY4741 replicates (left panels), and for control Micro-C reactions carried out without formaldehyde crosslinking of yeast (middle), or with a mock ligation step (right panel).

Each dataset is normalized to parts per million relative to all interactions out to 10 kb, and both axes are shown in log10 scale. Readily apparent here is a strong bias among IN-IN reads for undigested mononucleosomes and for N/N+1 products originating from undigested dinucleosomal DNA that is not eliminated by the biotin selection step (most likely due to incomplete exonuclease digestion after ligation – Figure 1A).

With two exceptions for N/N+2 (A2 and A3, both of which came from “fuzzy” regions of delocalized nucleosomes) the genomic product was ∼150 or ∼300 bp longer than the Micro-C library product, demonstrating that the Micro-C product resulted from ligation of digested mononucleosomes, and could not result from intact tri or tetranucleosomes. Nonetheless, because of the significant overabundance of IN-IN reads at short distances we exclude IN-IN ligation products for all downstream analyses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Micro-C data are shown for merged wild-type BY4741 replicates (left panels), and for control Micro-C reactions carried out without formaldehyde crosslinking of yeast (middle), or with a mock ligation step (right panel).

Nonetheless, because of the significant overabundance of IN-IN reads at short distances we exclude IN-IN ligation products for all downstream analyses. Our technique provides an overlapping but nonidentical view of chromosome folding to restriction enzyme-based methods (Figure S2; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Visual inspection of a prior low-resolution chromosome folding map for budding yeast (Duan et al., 2010Duan Z. Andronescu M. Schutz K. McIlwain S. Kim Y.J. Lee C. Shendure J. Fields S. Blau C.A. Noble W.S. A three-dimensional model of the yeast genome.Nature. 2010; 465: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) confirms the substantially higher resolution of our assay (Figure S2B). However, Micro-C poorly captures known long-distance interactions in yeast: while we do recover preferential interactions between short chromosomes and a modest signal for telomere-telomere interactions, these interactions are relatively weak, and centromere-centromere interactions are not observed (Figure S2). Micro-C thus serves as a complementary method to traditional 3C and Hi-C methods, being particularly well-suited to short-range analysis of nucleosome fiber folding, which is invisible to restriction enzyme-based 3C/Hi-C assays. As is typical of all chromatin interaction maps, the vast majority of Micro-C interactions occur close to the diagonal—nucleosomes tethered near one another in one dimension tend to contact each other in 3D space (Figures 1B and 1C; Table S2). Nonetheless, there is significant variation in the density of interactions along the diagonal (Figure 1B), with abundant ∼4–50 nucleosome “boxes” of internucleosome interactions that have a clear relationship to gene structure. These boxes of internucleosomal interactions are similar to the “topologically associated domains” (TADs) described in mammals (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y.

Cokus S.J. Schubert V. Zhai J. Pellegrini M. Jacobsen S.E. Genome-wide Hi-C analyses in wild-type and mutants reveal high-resolution chromatin interactions in Arabidopsis.Mol.

Here, we will adopt the more general “CID” nomenclature. As observed in multiple organisms, these interaction domains exhibit a nested architecture, with two strong short range domains often merging into a larger domain via somewhat weaker interactions. We consistently observe CIDs across 21 biological replicate samples (Figure S3; Tables S3 and S4) for S. cerevisiae including three separate “wild type” strain backgrounds (S288C, W303, and a S288C strain with the histone H3/H4-encoding genes relocated to a plasmid [Dai et al., 2008Dai J. Hyland E.M. Yuan D.S. Huang H. Bader J.S. Boeke J.D. Probing nucleosome function: a highly versatile library of synthetic histone H3 and H4 mutants.Cell. 2008; 134: 1066-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar]), as well as in a somewhat distantly related (last common ancestor ∼150 mY) hemiascomycete yeast, K. lactis (unpublished data). We systematically identified boundaries between CIDs by searching for locations that are strongly depleted of crossing interactions relative to the density of such interactions in the region (Figures 2A–2D , S3, and S4; Experimental Procedures). Boundary calls were consistent between replicates of wild-type yeast (Figures S3D, S3E, and S3H; Tables S3 and S4) and were not an artifact of MNase digestion level (Figures S3F–S3I; Tables S4 and S5). Globally, boundaries separating compacted local domains from one another were strongly enriched for the nucleosome depleted regions (NDRs) that are a widespread feature (Hughes and Rando, 2014Hughes A.L. Rando O.J. Mechanisms underlying nucleosome positioning in vivo.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2014; 43: 41-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) of yeast promoters (Figures 2B and 2E and below). That said, it is clear that not all promoters or NDRs form boundaries—CIDs ranged from zero to eight genes in length, with 45% of CIDs encompassing two or more genes (Figure 2F). Interestingly, as CIDs in budding yeast typically encompass one to five genes, at ∼2–10 kb they are one to two orders of magnitude shorter than mammalian TADs (∼100 kb–1 Mb)—the length of self-associating domains thus appears to be conserved when scaled by gene number, as opposed to sequence distance. What biochemical aspects of a given nucleosome might play a role in boundary activity? Overall, boundary nucleosomes were enriched for the pairs of nucleosomes flanking nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) in yeast and exhibited significant enrichment of a variety of histone marks found at the 5′ ends of genes (Weiner et al., 2015Weiner A. Hsieh T.H. Appleboim A. Chen H.V. Rahat A. Amit I. Rando O.J. Friedman N. High-Resolution Chromatin Dynamics during a Yeast Stress Response.Mol. Cell. 2015; 58: 371-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), including high levels of transcription-related marks such as H3K4me3 and H3K18ac (Figure 3A) and elevated rates of replication-independent H3 replacement (Dion et al., 2007Dion M.F. Kaplan T. Kim M. Buratowski S. Friedman N. Rando O.J. Dynamics of replication-independent histone turnover in budding yeast.Science. 2007; 315: 1405-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Not only were these enrichments significant relative to all nucleosomes in the genome, but for most histone modifications the enrichments observed were also highly significant when comparing boundary +1 nucleosomes only to other +1 nucleosomes (Figure S5A). Consistent with this, strong boundaries were generally found upstream of more highly transcribed genes than nonboundary promoters (Figure 3B; Tables S3 and S4). Other features of strong boundaries included high levels of the RSC ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex and high levels of the cohesin loading factor Scc2 (Lopez-Serra et al., 2014Lopez-Serra L. Kelly G. Patel H. Stewart A. Uhlmann F. The Scc2-Scc4 complex acts in sister chromatid cohesion and transcriptional regulation by maintaining nucleosome-free regions.Nat.

In contrast, ablating Nav1.8+ sensory neurons or silencing them with QX-314, a charged sodium channel inhibitor that enters via large-pore ion channels to specifically block nociceptors, substantially reduced ovalbumin- or house-dust-mite-induced airway inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. We also discovered that IL-5, a cytokine produced by activated immune cells, acts directly on nociceptors to induce the release of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). VIP then stimulates CD4+ and resident innate lymphoid type 2 cells, creating an inflammatory signaling loop that promotes allergic inflammation. Our results indicate that nociceptors amplify pathological adaptive immune responses and that silencing these neurons with QX-314 interrupts this neuro-immune interplay, revealing a potential new therapeutic strategy for asthma."
https://openalex.org/W1891854262,"Identifying the molecular mechanisms that underlie aging and their pharmacological manipulation are key aims for improving lifelong human health. Here, we identify a critical role for Ras-Erk-ETS signaling in aging in Drosophila. We show that inhibition of Ras is sufficient for lifespan extension downstream of reduced insulin/IGF-1 (IIS) signaling. Moreover, direct reduction of Ras or Erk activity leads to increased lifespan. We identify the E-twenty six (ETS) transcriptional repressor, Anterior open (Aop), as central to lifespan extension caused by reduced IIS or Ras attenuation. Importantly, we demonstrate that adult-onset administration of the drug trametinib, a highly specific inhibitor of Ras-Erk-ETS signaling, can extend lifespan. This discovery of the Ras-Erk-ETS pathway as a pharmacological target for animal aging, together with the high degree of evolutionary conservation of the pathway, suggests that inhibition of Ras-Erk-ETS signaling may provide an effective target for anti-aging interventions in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1836539731,"Direct lineage reprogramming induces dramatic shifts in cellular identity, employing poorly understood mechanisms. Recently, we demonstrated that expression of Neurog2 or Ascl1 in postnatal mouse astrocytes generates glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. Here, we take advantage of this model to study dynamics of neuronal cell fate acquisition at the transcriptional level. We found that Neurog2 and Ascl1 rapidly elicited distinct neurogenic programs with only a small subset of shared target genes. Within this subset, only NeuroD4 could by itself induce neuronal reprogramming in both mouse and human astrocytes, while co-expression with Insm1 was required for glutamatergic maturation. Cultured astrocytes gradually became refractory to reprogramming, in part by the repressor REST preventing Neurog2 from binding to the NeuroD4 promoter. Notably, in astrocytes refractory to Neurog2 activation, the underlying neurogenic program remained amenable to reprogramming by exogenous NeuroD4. Our findings support a model of temporal hierarchy for cell fate change during neuronal reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W1517688143,"Germline BAP1 mutations predispose to several cancers, in particular malignant mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is an aggressive malignancy generally associated with professional exposure to asbestos. However, to date, we found that none of the mesothelioma patients carrying germline BAP1 mutations were professionally exposed to asbestos. We hypothesized that germline BAP1 mutations might influence the asbestos-induced inflammatory response that is linked to asbestos carcinogenesis, thereby increasing the risk of developing mesothelioma after minimal exposure. Using a BAP1(+/-) mouse model, we found that, compared with their wild-type littermates, BAP1(+/-) mice exposed to low-dose asbestos fibers showed significant alterations of the peritoneal inflammatory response, including significantly higher levels of pro-tumorigenic alternatively polarized M2 macrophages, and lower levels of several chemokines and cytokines. Consistent with these data, BAP1(+/-) mice had a significantly higher incidence of mesothelioma after exposure to very low doses of asbestos, doses that rarely induced mesothelioma in wild-type mice. Our findings suggest that minimal exposure to carcinogenic fibers may significantly increase the risk of malignant mesothelioma in genetically predisposed individuals carrying germline BAP1 mutations, possibly via alterations of the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W1496318629,"Because of their similarity to humans, non-human primates are important models for studying human disease and developing therapeutic strategies. Establishment of chimeric animals using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) could help with these investigations, but has not so far been achieved. Here, we show that cynomolgus monkey ESCs (cESCs) grown in adjusted culture conditions are able to incorporate into host embryos and develop into chimeras with contribution in all three germ layers and in germ cell progenitors. Under the optimized culture conditions, which are based on an approach developed previously for naive human ESCs, the cESCs displayed altered growth properties, gene expression profiles, and self-renewal signaling pathways, suggestive of an altered naive-like cell state. Thus our findings show that it is feasible to generate chimeric monkeys using ESCs and open up new avenues for the use of non-human primate models to study both pluripotency and human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2132430680,"The Nod-like receptor family protein 3 (NLRP3)-inflammasome pathway is known to be activated by danger signals such as monosodium urate (MSU). We investigated the role of P2 purinergic receptors in the activation of NLRP3-inflammasome pathway after MSU treatment of primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). After initial stimulation with a low concentration of LPS (0.1 µg/ml), a 6 h treatment with MSU crystals (250, 500, and 1000 µg/ml) induced the MDMs to release IL-1β, IL-1α, and IL-6 in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the caspase 1 inhibitor Z-YVAD-FMK and the cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074Me reduced production of IL-1β in a dose-dependent manner after LPS + MSU treatment. We used real-time reverse transcription-quantitative PCR to show that treatment with LPS and MSU (500 µg/ml) induced significantly greater expression of NLRP3 and IL-1β than after treatment with LPS. We also found that MSU treatment induced P2X purinergic receptor 7 (P2X7R) mRNA and protein expression. Furthermore, addition of the P2X7 purinergic receptor antagonist A-740003 significantly impeded IL-1β production and pro-IL-1β cleavage after treatment with LPS + MSU. Remarkably, RNA silencing of P2X7R (but not P2X4R) inhibited the release of IL-1β and other M1 macrophage cytokines (such as IL-1α, IL-6, and TNF-α) from MDMs stimulated with LPS + MSU. Taken as a whole, our results show that P2 purinergic receptors and the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway are involved in the secretion of IL-1β from MSU-stimulated human macrophages. This pathway may constitute a novel therapeutic target for controlling the inflammatory process in several associated pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W1581511725,"Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is an aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma localized predominantly in body cavities. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) is the causative agent of PEL. PEL is an incurable malignancy and has extremely poor prognosis when treated with conventional chemotherapy. Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) lenalidomide and pomalidomide are Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs for the treatment of various ailments. IMiDs display pronounced antiproliferative effect against majority of PEL cell lines within their clinically achievable concentrations, by arresting cells at G0/G1 phase of cell cycle and without any induction of KSHV lytic cycle reactivation. Although microarray examination of PEL cells treated with lenalidomide revealed activation of interferon (IFN) signaling, blocking the IFN pathway did not block the anti-PEL activity of IMiDs. The anti-PEL effects of IMiDs involved cereblon-dependent suppression of IRF4 and rapid degradation of IKZF1, but not IKZF3. Small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of MYC enhanced the cytotoxicity of IMiDs. Bromodomain (BRD) and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins are epigenetic readers, which perform a vital role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. BRD4, a widely expressed transcriptional coactivator, belongs to the BET family of proteins, which has been shown to co-occupy the super enhancers associated with MYC. Specific BRD4 inhibitors were developed, which suppress MYC transcriptionally. Lenalidomide displayed synergistic cytotoxicity with several structurally distinct BRD4 inhibitors (JQ-1, IBET151 and PFI-1). Furthermore, combined administration of lenalidomide and BRD4 inhibitor JQ-1 significantly increased the survival of PEL bearing NOD-SCID mice in an orthotopic xenograft model as compared with either agent alone. These results provide compelling evidence for clinical testing of IMiDs alone and in combination with BRD4 inhibitors for PEL."
https://openalex.org/W1545743138,"Current standard of care for muscle-invasive urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) is surgery along with perioperative platinum-based chemotherapy. UCC is sensitive to cisplatin-based regimens, but acquired resistance eventually occurs, and a subset of tumors is intrinsically resistant. Thus, there is an unmet need for new therapeutic approaches to target chemotherapy-resistant UCC. Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a transcriptional co-activator that has been associated with bladder cancer progression and cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer. In contrast, YAP has been shown to induce DNA damage associated apoptosis in non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, no data have been reported on the YAP role in UCC chemo-resistance. Thus, we have investigated the potential dichotomous role of YAP in UCC response to chemotherapy utilizing two patient-derived xenograft models recently established. Constitutive expression and activation of YAP inversely correlated with in vitro and in vivo cisplatin sensitivity. YAP overexpression protected while YAP knockdown sensitized UCC cells to chemotherapy and radiation effects via increased accumulation of DNA damage and apoptosis. Furthermore, pharmacological YAP inhibition with verteporfin inhibited tumor cell proliferation and restored sensitivity to cisplatin. In addition, nuclear YAP expression was associated with poor outcome in UCC patients who received perioperative chemotherapy. In conclusion, these results suggest that YAP activation exerts a protective role and represents a pharmacological target to enhance the anti-tumor effects of DNA damaging modalities in the treatment of UCC."

However, much of the research has been invalidated by the unwitting use of false cell lines. A significant proportion of the research involving human cell lines was initiated in China. Paradoxically, the cell lines used in China have never been authenticated. Here, we present a comprehensive survey of cross-contamination in 380 samples from 113 independent sources in China using short tandem repeat profiling methods. High levels of cross-contamination were uncovered (95 of 380, 25%). Notable false cell lines (e.g., KB and WISH) are still actively used under their false identity and tissue attributions. Most strikingly, 85.51% of lines established in China were misidentified (59 of 69) and accounted for over half of the misidentifications (59 of 95, 62.11%). Further, 93.22% of the contaminants in cell lines established in laboratories of China were HeLa cells or a possible hybrid of HeLa with an unknown cell line. Results from these misidentified lines have been published in thousands of potentially erroneous articles and may have distorted the findings visible to the scientific community. False lines have been used in drug screening, potentially leading to unusable or even harmful therapeutic strategies. We also noted the causes of contamination and provided suggestions for remediation."
https://openalex.org/W1955893089,"Tumor stroma and growth factors provide a survival environment to tumor cells and can modulate their chemoresistance by dysregulating several signal pathways. In this study, we fabricated a three-dimensional (3D) microfluidic chip using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to investigate the impact of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) from cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) on the Met/PI3K/AKT activation, glucose regulatory protein (GRP78) expression and the paclitaxel-induced A549 cell apoptosis. With a concentration gradient generator, the assembled chip was able to reconstruct a tumor microenvironment in vitro. We found high levels of HGF in the supernatants of CAF and the CAF matrix from the supernatants of activated HFL1 fibroblasts or HGF enhanced the levels of Met, PI3K and AKT phosphorylation and GRP78 expression in A549 cells cultured in a 3D cell chamber, which was abrogated by anti-HGF. Inhibition of Met attenuated the CAF matrix-enhanced PI3K/AKT phosphorylation and GRP78 expression while inhibition of PI3K reduced GRP78 expression, but not Met phosphorylation in A549 cells. Inhibition of GRP78 failed to modulate the CAF matrix-enhanced Met/PI3K/AKT phosphorylation in A549 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K or GRP78 enhanced spontaneous and paclitaxel-induced A549 cell apoptosis. Moreover, treatment with the CAF matrix inhibited spontaneous and medium or high dose of paclitaxel-induced A549 cell apoptosis. Inhibition of PI3K or GRP78 attenuated the CAF matrix-mediated inhibition on paclitaxel-induced A549 cell apoptosis. Our data indicated that HGF in the CAF matrix activated the Met/PI3K/AKT and up-regulated GRP78 expression, promoting chemoresistance to paclitaxel-mediated apoptosis in A549 cells. Our findings suggest that the microfluidic system may represent an ideal platform for signaling research and drug screening."

These analyses suggest that three simple rules are sufficient to generate the seemingly complex neural superposition wiring of the fly visual map without an elaborate molecular matchmaking code. Our computational model explains robust and precise wiring in a crowded brain region despite extensive growth cone overlaps and provides a framework for matching molecular mechanisms with the rules they execute. Finally, ordered geometric axon terminal arrangements that are not required for neural superposition are a side product of the developmental algorithm, thus elucidating neural circuit connectivity that remained unexplained based on adult structure and function alone."
https://openalex.org/W2151387453,"β-Catenin, which is a key mediator of the wingless-integration site (Wnt)/β-catenin signaling pathway, plays an important role in cell proliferation, cell fate determination, and tumorigenesis, by regulating the expression of a wide range of target genes. Although a variety of posttranslational modifications are involved in β-catenin activity, the role of lysine methylation in β-catenin activity is largely unknown. In this study, su(var)3-9, enhancer-of-zeste, trithorax (SET) domain-containing protein 7 (SET7/9), a lysine methyltransferase, interacted with and methylated β-catenin, as demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. The interaction and methylation were significantly enhanced in response to H2O2 stimulation. A mutagenesis assay and mass spectrometric analyses revealed that β-catenin was monomethylated by SET7/9 at lysine residue 180. Methylated β-catenin was easily recognized by phosphokinase glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β for degradation. Consistent with this finding, the mutated β-catenin (K180R) that cannot be methylated exhibited a longer half-life than did the methylated β-catenin. The consequent depletion of SET7/9 by shRNA or the mutation of the β-catenin (K180R) significantly enhanced the expression of Wnt/β-catenin target genes such as c-myc and cyclin D1 and promoted the growth of cancer cells. Together, these results provide a novel mechanism by which Wnt/β-catenin signaling is regulated in response to oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W1568141334,"Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) enhances the formation of new alveolar bone, cementum, and periodontal ligament (PDL) in periodontal defect models. However, the mechanism through which FGF-2 acts in periodontal regeneration in vivo has not been fully clarified yet. To reveal the action mechanism, the formation of regenerated tissue and gene expression at the early phase were analyzed in a beagle dog 3-wall periodontal defect model. FGF-2 (0.3%) or the vehicle (hydroxypropyl cellulose) only were topically applied to the defect in FGF-2 and control groups, respectively. Then, the amount of regenerated tissues and the number of proliferating cells at 3, 7, 14, and 28 days and the number of blood vessels at 7 days were quantitated histologically. Additionally, the expression of osteogenic genes in the regenerated tissue was evaluated by real-time PCR at 7 and 14 days. Compared with the control, cell proliferation around the existing bone and PDL, connective tissue formation on the root surface, and new bone formation in the defect at 7 days were significantly promoted by FGF-2. Additionally, the number of blood vessels at 7 days was increased by FGF-2 treatment. At 28 days, new cementum and PDL were extended by FGF-2. Moreover, FGF-2 increased the expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and osteoblast differentiation markers (osterix, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin) in the regenerated tissue. We revealed the facilitatory mechanisms of FGF-2 in periodontal regeneration in vivo. First, the proliferation of fibroblastic cells derived from bone marrow and PDL was accelerated and enhanced by FGF-2. Second, angiogenesis was enhanced by FGF-2 treatment. Finally, osteoblastic differentiation and bone formation, at least in part due to BMP-2 production, were rapidly induced by FGF-2. Therefore, these multifaceted effects of FGF-2 promote new tissue formation at the early regeneration phase, leading to enhanced formation of new bone, cementum, and PDL."
https://openalex.org/W1500760179,"Sex-determining region Y box 6 (SOX6) has been described as a tumor-suppressor gene in several cancers. Our previous work has suggested that SOX6 upregulated p21(Waf1/Cip1)(p21) expression in a p53-dependent manner; however, the underlying mechanism has remained elusive. In this study, we confirmed that SOX6 can suppress cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo by stabilizing p53 protein and subsequently upregulating p21. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunocytofluorescence assays demonstrated that SOX6 can promote formation of the p14ARF-HDM2-p53 ternary complex by promoting translocation of p14ARF (p14 alternate reading frame tumor suppressor) to the nucleoplasm, thereby inhibiting HDM2-mediated p53 nuclear export and degradation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with PCR assay proved that SOX6 can bind to a potential binding site in the regulatory region of the c-Myc gene. Furthermore, we confirmed that SOX6 can downregulate the expression of c-Myc, as well as its direct target gene nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), and that the SOX6-induced downregulation of NPM1 is linked to translocation of p14ARF to the nucleoplasm. Finally, we showed that the highly conserved high-mobility group (HMG) domain of SOX6 is required for SOX6-mediated p53 stabilization and tumor inhibitory activity. Collectively, these results reveal a new mechanism of SOX6-mediated tumor suppression involving p21 upregulation via the p14ARF-HDM2-p53 axis in an HMG domain-dependent manner."

Loss of LKB1-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling confers sensitivity to metabolic inhibition or stress-induced mitochondrial insults. We tested the hypothesis that loss of LKB1 sensitizes NSCLC cells to energetic stress induced by treatment with erlotinib. LKB1-deficient cells exhibited enhanced sensitivity to erlotinib in vitro and in vivo that was associated with alterations in energy metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction. Loss of LKB1 expression altered the cellular response to erlotinib treatment, resulting in impaired ATP homeostasis and an increase in reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, erlotinib selectively blocked mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, inhibited cell growth and activated apoptosis in LKB1-deficient cells. Erlotinib treatment also induced AMPK activation despite loss of LKB1 expression, which was partially reduced by the application of a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 inhibitor (STO-609) or calcium chelator (BAPTA-AM). These findings may have significant implications for the design of novel NSCLC treatments that target dysregulated metabolic and signaling pathways in LKB1-deficient tumors."

In 35 patients treated with Peg-IFN±nucleos(t)ide-analogues (NUCs) sera were obtained at baseline, end-of-therapy and week-24-off-therapy and in 22 treated with NUCs (for 60 months, 42-134m) at baseline and end-of-follow-up. HBsAg and IgM-anti-HBc were measured by Architect-assays (Abbott, USA); total-anti-HBc by double-antigen-sandwich-immune-assay (Wantai, China); HBV-DNA by COBAS-TaqMan (Roche, Germany). Total-anti-HBc were detectable in all sera with lower levels in HBsAg-carriers without CHB (immune-tolerant, inactive and HDV-superinfected, median 3.26, range 2.26-4.49 Log10 IU/ml) versus untreated-CHB (median 4.68, range 2.76-5.54 Log10 IU/ml), p<0.0001. IgM-anti-HBc positive using the chronic-hepatitis-cut-off"" (0.130-S/CO) were positive in 102 of 212 sera (48.1%). Overall total-anti-HBc and IgM-anti-HBc correlated significantly (p<0.001, r=0.417). Total-anti-HBc declined significantly in CHB patients with response to Peg-IFN (p<0.001) and in NUC-treated patients (p<0.001); the lowest levels (median 2.68, range 2.12-3.08 Log10 IU/ml) were found in long-term responders who cleared HBsAg subsequently. During spontaneous and therapy-induced fluctuations of CHB (remissions and reactivations) total- and IgM-anti-HBc correlated with ALT (p<0.001, r=0.351 and p=0.008, r=0.185 respectively).

Although HSF1 has been identified as a driver of carcinogenesis, HSF2 has not been explored in malignancies. Here, we report that HSF2 suppresses tumor invasion of prostate cancer (PrCa). In three-dimensional organotypic cultures and the in vivo xenograft chorioallantoic membrane model HSF2 knockdown perturbs organoid differentiation and promotes invasiveness. Gene expression profiling together with functional studies demonstrated that the molecular mechanism underlying the effect on tumor progression originates from HSF2 steering the switch between acinar morphogenesis and invasion. This is achieved by the regulation of genes connected to, for example, GTPase activity, cell adhesion, extracellular matrix and actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Importantly, low HSF2 expression correlates with high Gleason score, metastasis and poor survival of PrCa patients, highlighting the clinical relevance of our findings. Finally, the study was expanded beyond PrCa, revealing that the expression of HSF2 is decreased in a wide range of cancer types. This study provides the first evidence for HSF2 acting as a suppressor of invasion in human malignancies."

Although normal vascular endothelium expresses low levels of CXCR7, marked upregulation of CXCR7 occurs in tumor vasculature in breast cancer and other tumors. To investigate effects of endothelial CXCR7 in breast cancer, we conditionally deleted this receptor from vascular endothelium of adult mice, generating CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND animals. CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice appeared phenotypically normal, although these animals exhibited a modest 35±3% increase in plasma CXCL12 as compared with control. Using two different syngeneic, orthotopic tumor implant models of breast cancer, we discovered that CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice had significantly greater local recurrence of cancer following resection, elevated numbers of circulating tumor cells and more spontaneous metastases. CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice also showed greater experimental metastases following intracardiac injection of cancer cells. These results establish that endothelial CXCR7 limits breast cancer metastasis at multiple steps in the metastatic cascade, advancing understanding of CXCL12 pathways in tumor environments and informing ongoing drug development targeting CXCR7 in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1536427332,"The molecular characterization of symbionts is pivotal for understanding the cross-talk between symbionts and hosts. In addition to valuable knowledge obtained from symbiont genomic studies, the biochemical characterization of symbionts is important to fully understand symbiotic interactions. The bean bug (Riptortus pedestris) has been recognized as a useful experimental insect gut symbiosis model system because of its cultivatable Burkholderia symbionts. This system is greatly advantageous because it allows the acquisition of a large quantity of homogeneous symbionts from the host midgut. Using these naive gut symbionts, it is possible to directly compare in vivo symbiotic cells with in vitro cultured cells using biochemical approaches. With the goal of understanding molecular changes that occur in Burkholderia cells as they adapt to the Riptortus gut environment, we first elucidated that symbiotic Burkholderia cells are highly susceptible to purified Riptortus antimicrobial peptides. In search of the mechanisms of the increased immunosusceptibility of symbionts, we found striking differences in cell envelope structures between cultured and symbiotic Burkholderia cells. The bacterial lipopolysaccharide O antigen was absent from symbiotic cells examined by gel electrophoretic and mass spectrometric analyses, and their membranes were more sensitive to detergent lysis. These changes in the cell envelope were responsible for the increased susceptibility of the Burkholderia symbionts to host innate immunity. Our results suggest that the symbiotic interactions between the Riptortus host and Burkholderia gut symbionts induce bacterial cell envelope changes to achieve successful gut symbiosis."
https://openalex.org/W1534766609,"Changes in climate projected for the 21st century are expected to trigger widespread and pervasive biotic impacts. Forecasting these changes and their implications for ecosystem services is a major research goal. Much of the research on biotic responses to climate change has focused on either projected shifts in individual species distributions or broad-scale changes in biome distributions. Here, we introduce a novel application of multinomial logistic regression as a powerful approach to model vegetation distributions and potential responses to 21st century climate change. We modeled the distribution of 22 major vegetation types, most defined by a single dominant woody species, across the San Francisco Bay Area. Predictor variables included climate and topographic variables. The novel aspect of our model is the output: a vector of relative probabilities for each vegetation type in each location within the study domain. The model was then projected for 54 future climate scenarios, spanning a representative range of temperature and precipitation projections from the CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensembles. We found that sensitivity of vegetation to climate change is highly heterogeneous across the region. Surprisingly, sensitivity to climate change is higher closer to the coast, on lower insolation, north-facing slopes and in areas of higher precipitation. While such sites may provide refugia for mesic and cool-adapted vegetation in the face of a warming climate, the model suggests they will still be highly dynamic and relatively sensitive to climate-driven vegetation transitions. The greater sensitivity of moist and low insolation sites is an unexpected outcome that challenges views on the location and stability of climate refugia. Projections provide a foundation for conservation planning and land management, and highlight the need for a greater understanding of the mechanisms and time scales of potential climate-driven vegetation transitions."
https://openalex.org/W1529313052,"Cancer cells often gains a growth advantage by taking up glucose at a high rate and undergoing aerobic glycolysis through intrinsic cellular factors that reprogram glucose metabolism. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a key transmitter of growth factor and anchorage stimulation, is aberrantly overexpressed or activated in most solid tumors, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). We determined whether FAK can act as an intrinsic driver to promote aerobic glycolysis and tumorigenesis. FAK inhibition decreases and overexpression increases intracellular glucose levels during unfavorable conditions, including growth factor deficiency and cell detachment. Amplex glucose assay, fluorescence and carbon-13 tracing studies demonstrate that FAK promotes glucose consumption and glucose-to-lactate conversion. Extracellular flux analysis indicates that FAK enhances glycolysis and decreases mitochondrial respiration. FAK increases key glycolytic proteins, including enolase, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), lactate dehydrogenase and monocarboxylate transporter. Furthermore, active/tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK directly binds to PKM2 and promotes PKM2-mediated glycolysis. On the other hand, FAK-decreased levels of mitochondrial complex I can result in reduced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Attenuation of FAK-enhanced glycolysis re-sensitizes cancer cells to growth factor withdrawal, decreases cell viability and reduces growth of tumor xenografts. These observations, for the first time, establish a vital role of FAK in cancer glucose metabolism through alterations in the OXPHOS-to-glycolysis balance. Broadly targeting the common phenotype of aerobic glycolysis and more specifically FAK-reprogrammed glucose metabolism will disrupt the bioenergetic and biosynthetic supply for uncontrolled growth of tumors, particularly glycolytic PDAC."

Using a novel invasive human glioma model, we previously identified the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR (aka CD271) as a mediator of glioma invasion. Herein, we provide evidence that preventing phosphorylation of p75NTR on S303 by pharmacological inhibition of PKA, or by a mutational strategy (S303G), cripples p75NTR-mediated glioma invasion resulting in serine phosphorylation within the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (SPV) of p75NTR. Consistent with this, deletion (ΔSPV) or mutation (SPM) of the PDZ motif results in abrogation of p75NTR-mediated invasion. Using a peptide-based strategy, we identified PDLIM1 as a novel signaling adaptor for p75NTR and provide the first evidence for a regulated interaction via S425 phosphorylation. Importantly, PDLIM1 was shown to interact with p75NTR in highly invasive patient-derived glioma stem cells/tumor-initiating cells and shRNA knockdown of PDLIM1 in vitro and in vivo results in complete ablation of p75NTR-mediated invasion. Collectively, these data demonstrate a requirement for a regulated interaction of p75NTR with PDLIM1 and suggest that targeting either the PDZ domain interactions and/or the phosphorylation of p75NTR by PKA could provide therapeutic strategies for patients with glioblastoma."

Here, we identify and characterized a molecular mechanism controlling MTSS1 expression, which impinges on a pro-tumorigenic role of MTSS1 in breast tumors. We found that in normal and in cancer cell lines ΔNp63 is able to drive the expression of MTSS1 by binding to a p63-binding responsive element localized in the MTSS1 locus. We reported that ΔNp63 is able to drive the migration of breast tumor cells by inducing the expression of MTSS1. Notably, in three human breast tumors data sets the MTSS1/p63 co-expression is a negative prognostic factor on patient survival, suggesting that the MTSS1/p63 axis might be functionally important to regulate breast tumor progression."

Chloride (Cl(-)) is known to directly bind and regulate the function of different actors of neuronal activity, and several studies have pointed to the possible modulation of mGluRs by Cl(-). Herein, we demonstrate that Cl(-) behaves as a positive allosteric modulator of mGluRs. For example, whereas glutamate potency was 3.08 ± 0.33 μM on metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) 4 receptors in high-Cl(-) buffer, signaling activity was almost abolished in low Cl(-) in cell-based assays. Cl(-) potency was 78.6 ± 3.5 mM. Cl(-) possesses a high positive cooperativity with glutamate (Hill slope ≈6 on mGlu4), meaning that small variations in [Cl(-)] lead to large variations in glutamate action. Using molecular modeling and mutagenesis, we have identified 2 well-conserved Cl(-) binding pockets in the extracellular domain of mGluRs. Moreover, modeling of activity-dependent Cl(-) variations at GABAergic synapses suggests that these variations may be compatible with a dynamic modulation of the most sensitive mGluRs present in these synapses. Taken together, these data reveal a necessary role of Cl(-) for the glutamate activation of many mGluRs. Exploiting Cl(-) binding pockets may yield to the development of innovative regulators of mGluR activity."

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programmes to prevent the disease will need to reach vulnerable girls who may not be able access health and screening services in the future. We conducted formative research on facilitators and barriers to HPV vaccination and potential acceptability of a future HPV vaccination programme amongst girls living in hard-to-reach populations in Kenya.Stakeholder interviews with Ministry of Health staff explored barriers to and support for the uptake of HPV vaccination. A situation assessment was conducted to assess community services in Maasai nomadic pastoralist communities in Kajiado County and in Korogocho informal settlement in Nairobi city, followed by focus group discussions (n=14) and semi-structured interviews (n=28) with health workers, parents, youth, and community and religious leaders. These covered marriage, knowledge of cervical cancer and HPV, factors that might inhibit or support HPV vaccine uptake and intention to accept HPV vaccine if a programme was in place.Reported challenges to an HPV vaccination programme included school absenteeism and drop-out, early age of sex and marriage, lack of parental support, population mobility and distance from services. Despite little prior knowledge of cervical cancer and HPV, communities were interested in receiving HPV vaccination. Adequate social mobilisation and school-based vaccination, supplemented by out-reach activities, were considered important facilitating factors to achieve high coverage. There was some support for a campaign approach to vaccine delivery.Given the high level of support for a vaccine against cervical cancer and the experience of reaching pastoralist and slum-dwellers for other immunizations, implementing an HPV vaccine programme should be feasible in such hard-to-reach communities. This may require additional delivery strategies in addition to the standard school-based delivery, with vaccine offered at multiple venues, potentially through a campaign approach."
https://openalex.org/W2141982593,"The bacterial mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (MscS) plays a crucial role in the protection of bacterial cells against hypo-osmotic shock. The functional characteristics of MscS have been extensively studied using liposomal reconstitution. This is a widely used experimental paradigm and is particularly important for mechanosensitive channels as channel activity can be probed free from cytoskeletal influence. A perpetual issue encountered using this paradigm is unknown channel orientation. Here we examine the orientation of MscS in liposomes formed using 2 ion channel reconstitution methods employing the powerful combination of patch clamp electrophysiology, confocal microscopy, and continuum mechanics simulation. Using the previously determined electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of MscS, we were able to determine that in liposomes, independent of lipid composition, MscS adopts the same orientation seen in native membranes. These results strongly support the idea that these specific methods result in uniform incorporation of membrane ion channels and caution against making assumptions about mechanosensitive channel orientation using the stimulus type alone."
https://openalex.org/W820396943,"The aim of the study was to compare maternal and cord blood levels of betatrophin--a new peptide potentially controlling beta cell growth--as well as in its mRNA expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue and placental tissue obtained from pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and gestational diabetes (GDM).Serum betatrophin and irisin concentrations were measured by ELISA in 93 patients with GDM and 97 women with NGT between 24 and 28 week of gestation. Additionally, maternal and cord blood betatrophin and irisin, as well as their genes (C19orf80 and Fndc5) expression were evaluated in 20 patients with GDM and 20 women with NGT at term.In both groups, serum betatrophin concentrations were significantly higher in the patients with GDM than in the controls (1.91 [1.40-2.60] ng/ml vs 1.63 [1.21-2.22] ng/ml, p=0.03 and 3.45 [2.77-6.53] ng/ml vs 2.78 [2.16-3.65] ng/ml, p=0.03, respectively). Cord blood betatrophin levels were also higher in the GDM than in the NGT group (20.43 [12.97-28.80] ng/ml vs 15.06 [10.11-21.36] ng/ml, p=0.03). In both groups betatrophin concentrations in arterial cord blood were significantly higher than in maternal serum (p=0.0001). Serum irisin levels were significantly lower in the patients with GDM (1679 [1308-2171] ng/ml) than in the healthy women between 24 and 28 week of pregnancy (1880 [1519-2312] ng/ml, p=0.03). Both C19orf80 and Fndc5 mRNA expression in fat and placental tissue did not differ significantly between the groups studied.Our results suggest that an increase in maternal and cord blood betatrophin might be a compensatory mechanism for enhanced insulin demand in GDM."
https://openalex.org/W1519164281,"Vascular calcification is a complex process and has been associated with aging, diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although there have been several studies that examine the role of miRNAs (miRs) in bone osteogenesis, little is known about the role of miRs in vascular calcification and their role in the pathogenesis of vascular abnormalities. Matrix vesicles (MV) are known to play in important role in initiating vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) calcification. In the present study, we performed miRNA microarray analysis to identify the dysregulated miRs between MV and VSMC derived from CKD rats to understand the role of post-transcriptional regulatory networks governed by these miRNAs in vascular calcification and to uncover the differential miRNA content of MV. The percentage of miRNA to total RNA was increased in MV compared to VSMC. Comparison of expression profiles of miRNA by microarray demonstrated 33 miRs to be differentially expressed with the majority (~ 57%) of them down-regulated. Target genes controlled by differentially expressed miRNAs were identified utilizing two different complementary computational approaches Miranda and Targetscan to understand the functions and pathways that may be affected due to the production of MV from calcifying VSMC thereby contributing to the regulation of genes by miRs. We found several processes including vascular smooth muscle contraction, response to hypoxia and regulation of muscle cell differentiation to be enriched. Signaling pathways identified included MAP-kinase and wnt signaling that have previously been shown to be important in vascular calcification. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that miRs are concentrated in MV from calcifying VSMC, and that important functions and pathways are affected by the miRs dysregulation between calcifying VSMC and the MV they produce. This suggests that miRs may play a very important regulatory role in vascular calcification in CKD by controlling an extensive network of post-transcriptional targets."
https://openalex.org/W1762900202,"It is well known that specific signal transduction inhibitors rarely suffice as anti-cancer agents. In most cases, tumors possess primary drug resistance due to their inherent heterogeneity, or acquire drug resistance due to genomic instability and acquisition of mutations. Here we expand our previous study of the novel compound, NT157, and show that it acts as a dual-targeting agent that invokes the blockage of two signal transduction pathways that are central to the development and maintenance of multiple human cancers. We show that NT157 targets not only IGF1R-IRS1/2, as previously reported, but also the Stat3 signaling pathway and demonstrates remarkable anti-cancer characteristics in A375 human melanoma cells and in a metastatic melanoma model in mice."
https://openalex.org/W1019944624,"1-Methylnicotinamide (MNA), which was initially considered to be a biologically inactive endogenous metabolite of nicotinamide, has emerged as an anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory agent with the capacity to release prostacyclin (PGI2). In the present study, we characterized the effects of MNA on exercise capacity and the endothelial response to exercise in diabetic mice. Eight-week-old db/db mice were untreated or treated with MNA for 4 weeks (100 mg·kg-1), and their exercise capacity as well as NO- and PGI2-dependent response to endurance running were subsequently assessed. MNA treatment of db/db mice resulted in four-fold and three-fold elevation of urine concentrations of MNA and its metabolites (Met-2PY + Met-4PY), respectively (P<0.01), but did not affect HbA1c concentration, fasting glucose concentration or lipid profile. However, insulin sensitivity was improved (P<0.01). In MNA-treated db/db mice, the time to fatigue for endurance exercise was significantly prolonged (P<0.05). Post-exercise Δ6-keto-PGF1α (difference between mean concentration in the sedentary and exercised groups) tended to increase, and post-exercise leukocytosis was substantially reduced in MNA-treated animals. In turn, the post-exercise fall in plasma concentration of nitrate was not affected by MNA. In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time that MNA improves endurance exercise capacity in mice with diabetes, and may also decrease the cardiovascular risk of exercise."
https://openalex.org/W1609251536,"Quiescent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are prone to mutagenesis, and accumulation of mutations can result in hematological malignancies. The mechanisms through which HSCs prevent such detrimental accumulation, however, are unclear. Here, we show that Aspp1 coordinates with p53 to maintain the genomic integrity of the HSC pool. Aspp1 is preferentially expressed in HSCs and restricts HSC pool size by attenuating self-renewal under steady-state conditions. After genotoxic stress, Aspp1 promotes HSC cycling and induces p53-dependent apoptosis in cells with persistent DNA damage foci. Beyond these p53-dependent functions, Aspp1 attenuates HSC self-renewal and accumulation of DNA damage in p53 null HSCs. Consequently, concomitant loss of Aspp1 and p53 leads to the development of hematological malignancies, especially T cell leukemia and lymphoma. Together, these data highlight coordination between Aspp1 and p53 in regulating HSC self-renewal and DNA damage tolerance and suggest that HSCs possess specific mechanisms that prevent accumulation of mutations and malignant transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1594148199,"CD44E is a frequently overexpressed variant of CD44 in gastric cancer. Mechanisms that regulate CD44 splicing and expression in gastric cancer remain unknown. Herein, we investigated the role of DARPP-32 (dopamine and cyclic adenosine monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein, Mr 32000) in promoting tumor growth through regulation of CD44 splicing. Using western blot and quantitative real-time PCR analysis, our results indicated that knockdown of endogenous DARPP-32 markedly reduces the expression of CD44 V8-V10 (CD44E). Using a quantitative splicing luciferase reporter system, we detected a significant increase in the reporter activity following DARPP-32 overexpression (P<0.001). Conversely, knocking down endogenous DARPP-32 significantly attenuated the splicing activity (P<0.001). Further experiments showed that DARPP-32 regulates the expression of SRp20 splicing factor and co-exists with it in the same protein complex. Inhibition of alternative splicing with digitoxin followed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting indicated that DARPP-32 has an important role in regulating SRp20 protein stability. The knockdown of endogenous DARPP-32 confirmed that DARPP-32 regulates the SRp20-dependent CD44E splicing. Using tumor xenograft mouse model, knocking down endogenous DARPP-32 markedly reduced SRp20 and CD44E protein levels with a decreased tumor growth. The reconstitution of SRp20 expression in these cells rescued tumor growth. In addition, we also demonstrated frequent co-overexpression and positive correlation of DARPP-32, SRp20 and CD44E expression levels in human gastric primary tumors. Our novel findings establish for the first time the role of DARPP-32 in regulating splicing factors in gastric cancer cells. The DARPP-32-SRp20 axis has a key role in regulating the CD44E splice variant that promotes gastric tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2116191646,"Parasite lipids can serve as signaling molecules, importantmembrane components, energy suppliers, and pathogenesis factors critical for survival. Functional roles of lipid changes in response to drug-generated stress in parasite survival remains unclear. To investigate this, Leishmania donovani parasites, the causative agents of kala-azar, were exposed to the antileishmanial agent potassium antimony tartrate (PAT) (half-maximal inhibitory concentration ∼ 284 μg/ml). Analysis of cell extracts using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed significant increases in very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) prior to an increase in ergosterol in PAT-treated parasites as compared with vehicle-treated controls. Ergosterol biosynthesis inhibition during PAT treatment decreased cell viability. VLCFA inhibition with specific inhibitors completely abrogated ergosterol upsurge followed by a reduction in cell viability. Following PAT-induced VLCFA increase, an upsurge in reactive oxygen species (ROS) occurred and inhibition of this ROS with antioxidants abrogated ergosterol increase. Genetically engineered parasites expressing low constitutive ergosterol levels showed more susceptibility to PAT as compared with wild-type control cells but ergosterol supplementation during PAT treatment increased cell viability. In conclusion, we propose that during antimony treatment, the susceptibility of parasites is determined by the levels of cellular ergosterol that are regulated by oxidative stress generated by VLCFAs.—Mathur, R., Das, R.

https://openalex.org/W753178062,"Enhanced proliferation of pulmonary arterial vascular smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) is a key pathological component of vascular remodeling in hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (HPH). Mammalian targeting of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling has been shown to play a role in protein translation and participate in the progression of pulmonary hypertension. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2α (eIF2α) is a key factor in regulation of cell growth and cell cycle, but its role in mTOR signaling and PASMCs proliferation remains unknown. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) rat model was established by hypoxia. Rapamycin was used to treat rats as an mTOR inhibitor. Proliferation of primarily cultured rat PASMCs was induced by hypoxia, rapamycin and siRNA of mTOR and eIF2α were used in loss-of-function studies. The expression and activation of eIF2α, mTOR and c-myc were analyzed. Results showed that mTOR/eIF2α signaling was significantly activated in pulmonary arteries from hypoxia exposed rats and PASMCs cultured under hypoxia condition. Treatment with mTOR inhibitor for 21 days attenuated vascular remodeling, suppressed mTOR and eIF2α activation, inhibited c-myc expression in HPH rats. In hypoxia-induced PASMCs, rapamycin and knockdown of mTOR and eIF2α by siRNA significantly abolished proliferation and increased c-myc expression. These results suggest a critical role of the mTOR/eIF2αpathway in hypoxic vascular remodeling and PASMCs proliferation of HPH."

We asked whether the presence of multiple cardiometabolic risk factors, and which particular combination, exerts additive negative effects on 25(OH)D3 levels; and whether 25(OH)D3 levels associate with markers of inflammation and oxidative stress.In non-diabetic medication-free adults central obesity (waist-to-height ratio > 0.5); elevated blood pressure (systolic BP≥130 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP ≥85 mm Hg); increased atherogenic risk (log(TAG/HDL) ≥ 0.11); and insulin resistance (QUICKI < 0.322) were considered as cardiometabolic risk factors. 25(OH)D3 status was classified as deficiency (25(OH)D3 ≤20 ng/ml); insufficiency (levels between 20-to-30 ng/ml), or as satisfactory (>30 ng/ml). Plasma adipokines, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, advanced glycation end-products, and their soluble receptor were determined.162 subjects were cardiometabolic risk factors-free, 162 presented increased (i.e. 1 or 2), and 87 high number (i.e. 3 or 4) of cardiometabolic risk factors. Mean 25(OH)D3 decreased with rising number of manifested risk factors (36 ± 14 ng/ml, 33 ± 14 ng/ml, and 31 ± 15 ng/ml, respectively; pANOVA: 0.010), while prevalence of hypovitaminosis D did not differ significantly.

Postoperative serum creatinine (Cr) was measured daily on the first week and on the 14th, 21st and 28th postoperative days (PO). The prevalence of acute renal failure (ARF) up to the 28th PO was analyzed by RIFLE-AKIN criteria. A Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) approach was used for comparison of longitudinal measurements of renal function.FHVP-CVP gradient > 3 mm Hg was observed in 26.7% (4/15) of the patients in the conventional group and in 17.6% (3/17) in the piggyback group (p = 0.68). Median FHVP-CVP gradient was 2 mm Hg (0-8 mmHg) vs. 3 mm Hg (0-7 mm Hg) in conventional and piggyback groups, respectively (p = 0.73). There is no statistically significant difference between the conventional (1/15) and the piggyback (2/17) groups regarding massive ascites development (p = 1.00).

In this study, five endopolygalacturonase (endo-PG) genes were cloned and functionally characterized in M. fructicola. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that the five MfPG genes are differentially expressed during pathogenesis and in culture under various pH regimes and carbon and nitrogen sources. MfPG1 encodes the major endo-PG and is expressed to significantly higher levels compared to the other four MfPGs in culture and in planta.

The MFPG1-GUS reporter was expressed in situ in conidia and hyphae following inoculation of flower petals, and qRT-PCR analysis confirmed MfPG1 expression during pathogenesis. MfPG1-overexpressing strains produced smaller lesions and higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the petals of peach and rose flowers than the wild-type strain, suggesting that MfPG1 affecting fungal virulence might be in part resulted from the increase of ROS in the Prunus-M. fructicola interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2229247371,"The phylum Deinococcus-Thermus is a deeply-branching lineage of bacteria widely recognized as one of the most extremophilic. Members of the Thermus genus are of major interest due to both their bioremediation and biotechnology potentials. However, the molecular mechanisms associated with these key metabolic pathways remain unknown. Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is a high-throughput means of studying the expression of a large suite of genes over time and under different conditions. The selection of a stably-expressed reference gene is critical when using relative quantification methods, as target gene expression is normalized to expression of the reference gene. However, little information exists as to reference gene selection in extremophiles. This study evaluated 11 candidate reference genes for use with the thermophile Thermus scotoductus when grown under different culture conditions. Based on the combined stability values from BestKeeper and NormFinder software packages, the following are the most appropriate reference genes when comparing: (1) aerobic and anaerobic growth: TSC_c19900, polA2, gyrA, gyrB; (2) anaerobic growth with varied electron acceptors: TSC_c19900, infA, pfk, gyrA, gyrB; (3) aerobic growth with different heating methods: gyrA, gap, gyrB; (4) all conditions mentioned above: gap, gyrA, gyrB. The commonly-employed rpoC does not serve as a reliable reference gene in thermophiles, due to its expression instability across all culture conditions tested here. As extremophiles exhibit a tendency for polyploidy, absolute quantification was employed to determine the ratio of transcript to gene copy number in a subset of the genes. A strong negative correlation was found to exist between ratio and threshold cycle (CT) values, demonstrating that CT changes reflect transcript copy number, and not gene copy number, fluctuations. Even with the potential for polyploidy in extremophiles, the results obtained via absolute quantification indicate that relative quantification is appropriate for RT-qPCR studies with this thermophile."
https://openalex.org/W2231013635,"We analyzed aquaporin 4 and -1 expression in subependymomas, benign and slow growing brain tumors WHO grade I. Ten subependymoma cases were investigated, five of the fossa inferior and five of the fossa superior.Using immunohistochemistry, we observed different aquaporin expression patterns depending on localization: aquaporin 4 and -1 were detected in infratentorial subependymomas in the entire tumor tissue. In contrast, supratentorial subependymomas revealed aquaporin 4 and -1 expression only in border areas of the tumor. PCR analyses however showed no difference in aquaporin 4 expression between all subependymomas independent of localization but at higher levels than in normal brain. In contrast, aquaporin 1 RNA levels were found to be higher only in infratentorial samples compared to supratentorial and normal brain samples. The reason for the different distribution pattern of aquaporin 4 in subependymomas still remains unclear. On the cellular level, aquaporin 4 was redistributed on the surface of the tumor cells, and in freeze fracture replicas no orthogonal arrays of particles were found. This was similar to our previous findings in malignant glioblastomas. From these studies, we know that extracellular matrix molecules within the tumor like agrin and its receptor alpha-dystroglycan are involved in forming orthogonal arrays of particles. In subependymomas neither agrin nor alpha-dystroglycan were detected around blood vessels.Taken together, we show in this study that in the benign subependymomas aquaporins 1 and 4 are dramatically redistributed and upregulated. We speculate that extracellular environments of infra- and supratentorial subependymomas are different and lead to different distribution patterns of aquaporin 4 and -1."

https://openalex.org/W2338901622,"In this study, we defined a new parameter, referred to as the cardiac stress index (CSI), using a nonlinear detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) of heart rate (HR). Our study aimed to incorporate the CSI into a cycling based fatigue monitoring system developed in our previous work so the muscle fatigue and cardiac stress can be both continuously and quantitatively assessed for subjects undergoing the cycling exercise. By collecting electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, the DFA scaling exponent α was evaluated on the RR time series extracted from a windowed ECG segment. We then obtained the running estimate of α by shifting a one-minute window by a step of 20 seconds so the CSI, defined as the percentage of all the less-than-one α values, can be synchronously updated every 20 seconds. Since the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale is considered as a convenient index which is commonly used to monitor subjective perceived exercise intensity, we then related the Borg RPE scale value to the CSI in order to investigate and quantitatively characterize the relationship between exercise-induced fatigue and cardiac stress. Twenty-two young healthy participants were recruited in our study. Each participant was asked to maintain a fixed pedaling speed at a constant load during the cycling exercise. Experimental results showed that a decrease in DFA scaling exponent α or an increase in CSI was observed during the exercise. In addition, the Borg RPE scale and CSI were positively correlated, suggesting that the factors due to cardiac stress might also contribute to fatigue state during physical exercise. Since the CSI can effectively quantify the cardiac stress status during physical exercise, our system may be used in sports medicine, or used by cardiologists who carried out stress tests for monitoring heart condition in patients with heart diseases."

Their prognostic value, however, remains inconclusive. We aimed to assess the prognostic role of visible para-aortic lymph nodes (PALNs). Methods Patients with confirmed pathologic diagnosis of CRC were enrolled. Correlations among clinicopathologic variables were analyzed using the χ2 test. The Cox proportional hazards model was applied for univariate and multivariate analyses. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. A prognostic model for visible PALNs in CRC patients was established. Results In total, 4527 newly diagnosed CRC patients were enrolled. Patients with visible PALNs had inferior overall survival compared to those without visible PALNs (5-year overall survival, 67% vs. 76%, P = 0.015). Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (hazard ratio = 1.865, P = 0.015); nodal disease (pN+) status (hazard ratio = 2.099, P = 0.006); elevated preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels (hazard ratio = 2.263, P < 0.001); and visible PALNs ≥10 mm (hazard ratio = 1.638, P = 0.031) were independent prognostic factors for patients with visible PALNs. If each prognostic factor scored one point, 5-year overall survival of lower- (prognostic score 0–1), intermediate- (prognostic score 2), and high- (prognostic score 3–4) risk groups were, 78%. 54%, and 25% respectively (P < 0.001). Conclusions The prognostic model, which included LVI, pN+ status, preoperative serum CEA level, and the size of visible PALNs, could effectively distinguish the outcome of patients with visible PALNs."

One main obstacle is the lack of an efficient small animal model. Cluster of differentiation 81 (CD81) is an essential entry coreceptor for HCV species specificity to humans, though the underlying mechanisms are yet to be fully elucidated. We performed structural, biophysical, and virologic studies on HCV nonpermissive CD81s from mice and African green monkeys [mouse cluster of differentiation 81 (mCD81) and African green monkey cluster of differentiation 81 (agmCD81)] and compared with human cluster of differentiation 81 (hCD81).

This structural feature is missing in hCD81. We demonstrated that the introduction of a single 188-196 bond to hCD81 impaired its binding affinity to HCV envelope glycoprotein 2 (HCV E2) and significantly decreased HCV pseudoviral particle (HCVpp) entry efficiency (4.92- to 8.42-fold) and cell culture-grown HCV (HCVcc) infectivity (4.55-fold), despite the availability of Phe186. For HCV nonpermissive CD81s, the introduction of Phe186 by Leu186F substitution alone was insufficient to confer HCV permissiveness. The disruption of the original 188-196 bond and Leu186F substitution were both required for potent binding to HCV E2 HCVpp entry efficiency and HCVcc infectivity. Our structural and biophysical analyses suggest that the intramolecular 188-196 bond restricts the intrinsic conformational dynamics of D-helix of CD81-LEL, which is essential for HCV entry, thus impairs HCV permissiveness. Our findings reveal a novel molecular determinant for HCV entry in addition to the well-characterized Phe186 and provide further guideline for selecting an HCV small animal model."
https://openalex.org/W2173541014,"The DEAD-box RNA helicase Ded1, which is essential in yeast and known as DDX3 in humans, shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm and takes part in several basic processes including RNA processing and translation. A key interacting partner of Ded1 is the exportin Xpo1, which together with the GTP-bound state of the small GTPase Ran, facilitates unidirectional transport of Ded1 out of the nucleus. Here we demonstrate that Xpo1 and Ran[GTP] together reduce the RNA-stimulated ATPase and helicase activities of Ded1. Binding and inhibition of Ded1 by Xpo1 depend on the affinity of the Ded1 nuclear export sequence (NES) for Xpo1 and the presence of Ran[GTP]. Association with Xpo1/Ran[GTP] reduces RNA-stimulated ATPase activity of Ded1 by increasing the apparent KM for the RNA substrate. Despite the increased KM, the Ded1:Xpo1:Ran[GTP] ternary complex retains the ability to bind single stranded RNA, suggesting that Xpo1/Ran[GTP] may modulate the substrate specificity of Ded1. These results demonstrate that, in addition to transport, exportins such as Xpo1 also have the capability to alter enzymatic activities of their cargo."

A glucose analogue 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) has been used to detect atherosclerotic inflammation. However, it is not known to what extent [18F]FDG is taken up in different stages of atherosclerosis. We aimed to study the uptake of [18F]FDG to various stages of coronary plaques in a pig model.First, diabetes was caused by streptozotocin injections (50 mg/kg for 3 days) in farm pigs (n = 10). After 6 months on high-fat diet, pigs underwent dual-gated cardiac PET/CT to measure [18F]FDG uptake in coronary arteries. Coronary segments (n = 33) were harvested for ex vivo measurement of radioactivity and autoradiography (ARG).Intimal thickening was observed in 16 segments and atheroma type plaques in 10 segments. Compared with the normal vessel wall, ARG showed 1.7±0.7 times higher [18F]FDG accumulation in the intimal thickening and 4.1±2.3 times higher in the atheromas (P = 0.004 and P = 0.003, respectively). Ex vivo mean vessel-to-blood ratio was higher in segments with atheroma than those without atherosclerosis (2.6±1.2 vs. 1.3±0.7, P = 0.04). In vivo PET imaging showed the highest target-to-background ratio (TBR) of 2.7. However, maximum TBR was not significantly different in segments without atherosclerosis (1.1±0.5) and either intimal thickening (1.2±0.4, P = 1.0) or atheroma (1.6±0.6, P = 0.4).We found increased uptake of [18F]FDG in coronary atherosclerotic lesions in a pig model. However, uptake in these early stage lesions was not detectable with in vivo PET imaging. Further studies are needed to clarify whether visible [18F]FDG uptake in coronary arteries represents more advanced, highly inflamed plaques."
