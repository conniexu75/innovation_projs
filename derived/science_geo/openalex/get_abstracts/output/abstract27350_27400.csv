https://openalex.org/W1490172408,"Vascular anticoagulant alpha (VAC alpha, annexin V) is a member of the family of calcium and phospholipid binding proteins, the annexins. The binding properties of VAC alpha to phospholipid bilayers were studied by ellipsometry. Adsorption was calcium-dependent and completely reversible upon calcium depletion. Half-maximal adsorptions to phospholipid bilayers consisting of 100, 20, 5, and 1% dioleoyl-phosphatidylserine (DOPS) supplemented with dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) were reached at Ca2+ concentrations of 0.04, 0.22, 1.5, and 8.6 mM. These surfaces all showed the same maximal adsorption of 0.22 +/- 0.01 micrograms of VAC alpha/cm2 (mean +/- S.D.). The adsorption to bilayers containing more than 10% DOPS was independent of VAC alpha concentrations in the range of 0.5-100 nM. Dissociation constants for VAC alpha binding to these surfaces were estimated to be below 2 x 10(-10) M. No adsorption was observed on pure DOPC bilayers at a Ca2+ concentration of 3 mM. The ability to mediate VAC alpha binding to 20% DOPS/80% DOPC bilayers was highly specific for Ca2+. The use of other divalent cations resulted in decreased binding in the order Cd2+ greater than Zn2+ greater than Mn2+ greater than Co2+ greater than Ba2+ greater than Mg2+. Zinc ions had a synergistic effect on Ca2(+)-dependent VAC alpha binding. The Ca2+ concentration needed for half-maximal binding to cardiolipin, dioleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol, DOPS, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid, dioleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin increased in that order. Adsorption was independent of the overall surface charge of the phospholipid membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2041875613,"Triggering of the antigen-specific T cell receptor-CD3 complex (TCR-CD3) stimulates a rapid phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids, resulting in the production of second messengers and in T cell activation and proliferation. The role of tyrosine phosphorylation in these events was investigated with a tyrosine protein kinase (TPK) inhibitor, genistein. At doses that inhibited TPK activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of the TCR Î¶ subunit, but not phospholipase C activity, genistein prevented TCR-CD3-mediated phospholipase C activation, interleukin-2 receptor expression, and T cell proliferation. These findings indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation is an early and critical event that most likely precedes, and is a prerequisite for, inositol phospholipid breakdown during receptor-mediated T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W2029524468,"We describe a reaggregated cell culture system in which retinal neuroepithelial cells from embryonic rats proliferate extensively and give rise to rod photoreceptors on the same schedule in vitro as they do in vivo. Both the proliferative potential of the embryonic neuroepithelial cells and the timing of their differentiation into rods are not changed by the presence of a 50-fold excess of neonatal neural retinal cells, although many more of the embryonic cells develop into rods in these circumstances. In such mixed-age cultures, dividing neonatal cells proliferate much less and give rise to rods much sooner than do dividing embryonic cells, suggesting that the dividing cells at the two ages are intrinsically different. These and other findings suggest that both cell-cell interactions and an intrinsic program in neuroepithelial cells determine cell fate in the developing rat retina."
https://openalex.org/W1529646916,The integrins are a family of heterodimeric cell surface receptors for extracellular matrix molecules. An analysis of integrin subunits expressed by a number of cell lines identified a novel heterodimer. The alpha subunit of this integrin was immunologically and electrophoretically indistinguishable from the vitronectin receptor alpha subunit (alpha v) and the beta subunit was indistinguishable from beta 1. Affinity chromatography experiments and cell adhesion assays indicated that this receptor complex is a new fibronectin receptor. Its unexpected subunit composition demonstrates the importance of the beta subunit in determining the ligand specificity of integrins and suggests that the current integrin classification scheme needs revision.
https://openalex.org/W2105191016,"To elucidate the mechanism of secretory granule formation, we here identify the first intermediate in this process, the immature secretory granule, in the neuroendocrine cell line PC12 and demonstrate the packaging of a regulated secretory protein, secretogranin II, to immature secretory granules in a cell-free system. The formation of immature secretory granules was as fast (t1/2 approximately 5 min) as that of constitutive secretory vesicles identified by the presence of a rapidly secreted heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Using the cell-free system, the formation of post-Golgi secretory vesicles was found to be dependent upon ATP. Two distinct populations of vesicles were formed: immature secretory granules containing secretogranin II and constitutive secretory vesicles containing the heparan sulfate proteoglycan. These results show that in a cell-free system, a constitutive and a regulated secretory protein are sorted upon exit from the trans-Golgi network."
https://openalex.org/W1679707032,"Eukaryotic cells adhere to at least two different regions of the fibronectin molecule: a central domain present in all fibronectin isoforms, and the type III connecting segment domain (IIICS), the expression of which is controlled by complex alternative splicing of precursor mRNA. Using affinity chromatography on a matrix containing a synthetic peptide ligand (CS1) representing the strongest active site within the IIICS, we have isolated the human melanoma cell receptor recognizing this region of fibronectin. The receptor is a complex of two polypeptides with subunit molecular masses of 145 and 125 kDa. This heterodimeric structure resembles that of receptors for other extracellular matrix proteins. Immunological analysis with specific antibodies identified these polypeptides as the integrin subunits alpha 4 and beta 1. In addition, antifunctional monoclonal antibodies directed against either alpha 4 or beta 1, but not against other integrin subunits, were potent inhibitors of CS1-mediated melanoma cell spreading. Furthermore, when the function of the central cell-binding domain was blocked, anti-alpha 4 and anti-beta 1 antibodies abolished spreading of A375-M cells on fibronectin, indicating that alpha 4 beta 1 is an authentic fibronectin receptor. Taken together, these results identify the human fibronectin IIICS receptor as the integrin heterodimer alpha 4 beta 1."
https://openalex.org/W1978417778,"In vitro studies have shown that cytokines are involved in the regulation of the immune response, but their role in vivo is less well defined. Specific cytokine antagonists enable the identification of particular cytokines involved in the response and offer a means for modifying it. Systemic administration of a soluble, extracellular portion of the receptor for interleukin-1 (sIL-1R) had profound inhibitory effects on the development of in vivo alloreactivity. Survival of heterotopic heart allografts was prolonged from 12 days in controls to 17 days in mice treated with sIL-1R. Lymph node hyperplasia in response to a localized injection of allogeneic cells was completely blocked by sIL-1R treatment. The inhibition was overcome by simultaneous administration of interleukin-1 (IL-1); thus, sIL-1R acts by neutralizing IL-1. These results implicate IL-1 as a regulator of allograft rejection and demonstrate the in vivo biological efficacy of a soluble cytokine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1559321275,"Structures of the major glycolipids isolated from the protozoan parasite Leishmania major (strains V121 and LRC-L119), were elucidated by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, two-dimensional proton NMR, methylation analysis, exoglycosidase digestions and mild acid hydrolysis. These glycolipids belong to a family of glycoinositolphospholipids (GIPLs), which contain 4-6 saccharide residues linked to alkylacylphosphatidylinositol (alkylacyl-PI) or lyso alkyl-PI. The general structure of the elucidated GIPLs can be expressed as follows: R-3Galf(alpha 1-3)Manp(alpha 1-3)Manp(alpha 1-4)GlcNp(alpha 1-6) alkylacyl-PI or lyso alkyl-PI where R = OH for GIPL-1; R = Galp(alpha 1- for GIPL-2; R = Galp(alpha 1-6)Galp (alpha 1- for GIPL-3 and R = Galp(alpha 1-3)Galf(alpha 1- for GIPL-A. The alkylacyl-PI lipid moieties are unusual in containing predominantly 18:0, 22:0, 24:0, or 26:0 alkyl chains and 12:0, 14:0, or 16:0 acyl chains. Remodeling of the lipid moieties may occur based on the finding that 1) lyso derivatives account for approximately 35% of the GIPL-3 fraction in strain V121 and 2) there is an increase in the proportion of 24:0 and 26:0 alkyl chains with elongation of the carbohydrate chain. Together with the elucidated structures, these properties are consistent with some of the GIPLs having a role as biosynthetic precursors to the major cell surface glycoconjugate, lipophosphoglycan. In particular, the saccharide sequences of GIPL-3, lyso-GIPL-3, and the glycan core of lipophosphoglycan (Turco, S. J., Orlandi, P. A., Homans, S. W., Ferguson, M. A. J., Dwek, R. A., and Rademacher, T. W. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 6711-6715) are identical. Finally, immunostaining of thin layer chromatograms with antibodies from patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis suggests that the major GIPLs are highly immunogenic and that the elevated anti-Gal antibodies, commonly seen in leishmaniasis patients, may be directed against terminal Galp(alpha 1-3)Galf residues."
https://openalex.org/W1484446060,"An Na(+)- and HCO3(-)-independent mechanism of cytoplasmic pH (pHi) recovery was previously demonstrated in acid-loaded macrophages (Swallow, C. J., Grinstein, S., and Rotstein, O. D. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 19558-19563). Acid extrusion was found to be ATP-dependent and sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, suggesting involvement of an H(+)-pumping ATPase. In this report, the properties and mode of activation of this putative pump were studied in detail. In acid-loaded cells, pHi recovery, measured using a fluorescent probe, was found to be insensitive to azide or oligomycin, which are inhibitors of F0F1 (mitochondrial) H(+)-ATPases, and to vanadate, an inhibitor of E1E2-type ATPases. Instead, the recovery was sensitive to the vacuolar type H(+)-ATPase inhibitors 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid, and bafilomycin A1. Using the fluorescent probes bisoxonol and 3,3'-dipropylthiodicarbocyanide iodide to measure the membrane potential of intact cells, acid loading of macrophages was shown to result in an N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-sensitive hyperpolarization of approximately 15 mV. This hyperpolarization was not inhibited by charybdotoxin, suggesting that it was not due to efflux of K+ through Ca2(+)-activated K+ channels, but may instead be due to electrogenic pumping of protons across the plasma membrane. This was consistent with the partial dependence of the Na(+)- and HCO3(-)-independent pHi recovery on the presence of intracellular Cl-. As in vacuolar membranes, Cl- appears to act as a counterion to H+, preserving electroneutrality and thus facilitating pHi recovery. In acid-loaded urinary epithelial cells, activation of H+ pumping occurs by exocytic insertion of intracellular (vacuolar) H(+)-ATPases into the plasma membrane. In this system, exocytosis is triggered by an associated increase in the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration and is microtubule-dependent. We determined whether an analogous process exists in macrophages. Acid loading of macrophages induced an approximately 120 nM increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration due to mobilization of Ca2+ from an intracellular source. However, preventing this increase by preloading macrophages with bis(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid did not inhibit the Na+ and HCO3(-)-independent pHi recovery, neither was the recovery inhibited by microtubular disruption using 0.1 mM colchicine. Furthermore, cytoplasmic acid loading did not cause a detectable release of secretory granular, endosomal, or lysosomal contents, suggesting that activation of H+ pumping at the cell surface is not mediated by exocytic fusion of these compartments with the plasma membrane. Taken together, these data suggest that H(+)-ATPases are constitutively present in the macrophage plasma membrane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1519782775,"Glu309, Glu771, Asn796, Thr799, Asp800, and Glu908 (ligands 1 to 6, respectively) appear to form the high affinity Ca2(+)-binding sites of the Ca2(+)-ATPase. The plasticity of the Ca2(+)-binding sites was tested by separate replacement of each of the ligands with a structurally similar oxygen-containing residue using site-specific mutagenesis. Mutant cDNAs were transfected into COS-1 cells, and ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport or partial reactions were studied in microsomes containing the expressed Ca2(+)-ATPases. In most cases where amino acid substitutions were carried out, the expressed enzymes lacked Ca2+ transport function and Ca2(+)-dependent phosphorylation by ATP. Furthermore, the mutant enzymes were phosphorylated by inorganic phosphate, even in the presence of Ca2+, which inhibits phosphorylation of the wild-type enzyme possessing intact Ca2(+)-binding sites. On mutant, however, containing an isosteric replacement of Glu by Gln at ligand 6, exhibited wild-type levels of Ca2+ transport activity and Ca2+ affinity. Two mutants exhibited properties consistent with a reduction in Ca2+ affinity. In the mutant in which Thr was replaced by Ser at ligand 4, Ca2+ transport activity was 70% of wild-type, while half-maximal activation by Ca2+ occurred at 0.8 microM as compared to 0.3 microM for the wild-type enzyme. In the mutant Glu309----Asp at ligand 1, Ca2+ transport activity was lost, but Ca2(+)-activated phosphorylation by ATP was retained. The concentration of Ca2+ required to activate phosphorylation was increased about 10-fold, however, compared to wild type. These results support our hypothesis that ligands 1 to 6, believed to reside within the transmembrane domain, interact with Ca2+ ions during the transport process. The roles of 12 other oxygen-containing residues and of His278 located in the transmembrane domain were also examined by mutation. Although the oxygen-containing side chains of these residues are potential Ca2+ ligands, their replacement with nonpolar amino acids did not abolish Ca2+ transport function, leading to the conclusion that they are not essential ligands for high affinity Ca2+ binding by the Ca2+ pump."

https://openalex.org/W1556428005,"We have isolated three overlapping genomic clones extending over 39 kilobases (kb), which encodes the rabbit cardiac sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2(+)-ATPase gene (SERCA2). S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension analysis of the 5' end of the cardiac/slow-twitch (SERCA2a) and smooth/non-muscle (SERCA2b) mRNAs showed that both transcripts are initiated from the same transcription initiation site, located 528 base pairs (bp) upstream of the translation initiation codon AUG. The putative promoter revealed a TATA box like element at -24 bp and a CAAT box at -78 bp relative to the cap site. A number of DNA sequence elements that could bind trans-acting factors were also found within the 1.8 kb of DNA sequence upstream from the transcription initiation site. To determine the DNA sequences governing transcriptional regulation, we have stably transfected the myogenic cell line C2C12 with a plasmid containing the putative promoter and 946 bp upstream sequence of the SERCA2 gene, coupled to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Our results show that this chimeric plasmid construct exhibits appropriate activation and coordinate expression with the endogenous SERCA2 gene during the terminal differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes, suggesting that it contains the promoter and upstream sequence elements required for the regulated expression of the SERCA2 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1640144340,"Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) induces platelet shape change, secretion, and aggregation. Using a novel TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonist, [1r-[1 alpha(Z),2 beta,3 beta,5 alpha]]-(+)-7-[5-[[(1,1'- biphenyl)-4-yl]methoxy]-3-hydroxy-2-(1-piperidinyl) cyclopentyl]-4-heptenoic acid hydrochloride (GR32191), we demonstrate that these responses are mediated by at least two receptor-effector systems. GR32191 non-competitively inhibited platelet aggregation to the TXA2 mimetics, (15S)-hydroxy-11,9-(epoxymethano) prostadienoic acid (U46619) and [1S-(1 alpha,2 beta(5Z),3 alpha (1E,-3S), 4 alpha)]-7-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-(p-iodophenoxy)-1-butenyl)7- oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2yl]-5-heptenoic acid by binding irreversibly to a TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor. Dissociation of [3H]GR32191 from human platelets demonstrated two specific binding sites, one which was rapidly dissociating and a site to which binding was essentially irreversible. Stimulation by U46619 of platelets incubated with GR32191 and subsequently washed to expose the reversible binding site failed to aggregate or to secrete [3H]5-hydroxy-tryptamine; formation of inositol phosphates and activation of protein kinase C were markedly suppressed. In contrast, platelet shape change and calcium stimulation remained at 90% of control. Furthermore, stimulation of the reversible binding site with U46619 induced aggregation in the presence of ADP, demonstrating its functional importance in amplifying the response to other agonists. These data suggest that TXA2 mediates platelet activation through at least two receptor-effector systems; one linked to phospholipase C activation, resulting in platelet aggregation and secretion and a second site mediating an increase in cytosolic calcium and platelet shape change."
https://openalex.org/W2013672801,"The role of troponin-I (the inhibitory subunit of troponin) in the regulation by Ca2+ of skeletal muscle contraction was investigated with resonance energy transfer and photo cross-linking techniques. The effect of Ca2+ on the proximity of troponin-I to actin in reconstituted rabbit skeletal thin filaments was determined. The distance between the cysteine residue at position 133 (Cys133) of troponin-I and Cys374 of actin increases by approximately 15 angstroms on binding of Ca2+ to troponin-C. Also, troponin-I labeled at Cys133 with benzophenone-4-maleimide could be photo cross-linked to actin in the absence of Ca2+, but not in its presence. These results suggest that troponin-I is attached to actin in the Ca2(+)-free or relaxed state of muscle, and that it detaches from actin on Ca2+ activation of contraction. Thus, troponin-I may function as a Ca2(+)-dependent molecular switch in regulation of skeletal muscle contraction."
https://openalex.org/W1598988225,"A common diagnostic feature of glycosylinositol phospholipid (GPI)-anchored proteins is their release from the membrane by a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). However, some GPI-anchored proteins are resistant to this enzyme. The best characterized example of this subclass is the human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase, where the structural basis of PI-PLC resistance has been shown to be the acylation of an inositol hydroxyl group(s) (Roberts, W. L., Myher, J. J., Kuksis, A., Low, M. G., and Rosenberry, T. L. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 18766-18775). Both PI-PLC-sensitive and resistant GPI-anchor precursors (P2 and P3, respectively) have been found in Trypanosoma brucei, where the major surface glycoprotein is anchored by a PI-PLC-sensitive glycolipid anchor. The accompanying paper (Mayor, S., Menon, A. K., Cross, G. A. M., Ferguson, M. A. J., Dwek, R. A., and Rademacher, T. W. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 6164-6173) shows that P2 and P3 have identical glycans, indistinguishable from the common core glycan found on all the characterized GPI protein anchors. This paper shows that the single difference between P2 and P3, and the basis for the PI-PLC insusceptibility of P3, is a fatty acid, ester-linked to the inositol residue in P3. The inositol-linked fatty acid can be removed by treatment with mild base to restore PI-PLC sensitivity. Biosynthetic labeling experiments with [3H]palmitic acid and [3H]myristic acid show that [3H]palmitic acid specifically labels the inositol residue in P3 while [3H]myristic acid labels the diacylglycerol portion. Possible models to account for the simultaneous presence of PI-PLC-resistant and sensitive glycolipids are discussed in the context of available information on the biosynthesis of GPI-anchors."
https://openalex.org/W2168176123,"Photoaffinity labeling of purified cellulose synthase with [beta-32P]5-azidouridine 5'-diphosphoglucose (UDP-Glc) has been used to identify the UDP-Glc binding subunit of the cellulose synthase from Acetobacter xylinum strain ATCC 53582. The results showed exclusive labeling of an 83-kDa polypeptide. Photoinsertion of [beta-32P]5-azido-UDP-Glc is stimulated by the cellulose synthase activator, bis-(3'----5') cyclic diguanylic acid. Addition of increasing amounts of UDP-Glc prevents photolabeling of the 83-kDa polypeptide. The reversible and photocatalyzed binding of this photoprobe also showed saturation kinetics. These studies demonstrate that the 83-kDa polypeptide is the catalytic subunit of the cellulose synthase in A. xylinum strain ATCC 53582."
https://openalex.org/W1984961927,"We constructed chimeric receptor chains in which an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (VH) from a phosphorylcholine-specific antibody is substituted for T cell receptor (Tcr) alpha and beta V regions. We demonstrate that the VH region joined to either the C alpha or the C beta region can form stable chimeric proteins in EL4 T cells. Both chimeric receptor chains associate with CD3 polypeptides in functional receptor complexes and respond to phosphorylcholine coupled to Sepharose beads. The VH-C alpha chimeric chain associates with the EL4 beta chain, while the VH-C beta chimeric protein appears to form either a homodimer or a heterodimer with the native EL4 beta chain. Thus, functional receptor complexes can be formed using two C beta regions, and the C alpha region may not be required for CD3 association and surface expression of Tcr complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1586743471,"The T-cell antigen receptor (TcR) complex present on most T-cells is formed by a clone-specific disulfide-linked alpha/beta heterodimer noncovalently associated to the CD3 complex, the latter composed of five invariant polypeptides: gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta/zeta, or zeta/eta. The presence of conserved, oppositely charged, amino acids in the predicted transmembrane domains of all the subunits of the TcR.CD3 complex suggests that these residues may have a critical function in the assembly and/or stabilization of the complex. In order to analyze the role of the transmembrane-charged amino acids in the association and cell surface expression of the TcR.CD3 complex, we have carried out site-directed mutagenesis of Lys271 in the transmembrane domain of the TcR beta chain and analyzed the capacity of the altered chain to assemble in a TcR beta-negative T-cell line. Here we show that substitution of this positively charged residue by alanine or glutamine does not prevent cytoplasmic association of alpha and beta chains to form disulfide-linked heterodimers, but does abolish formation of an alpha/beta.CD3 complex and, consequently, its expression on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1606877980,"Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by a deficiency in beta-hexosaminidase A. We have characterized a new mutation in a Tunisian patient displaying a late infantile form of Tay-Sachs disease. Northern blot analysis of patient's fibroblast total RNAs shows a broad, fast migrating band in the region of the normal beta-hexosaminidase alpha transcripts. The mRNA coding for beta-hexosaminidase alpha subunit was first reverse transcribed and then amplified in four overlapping segments spanning the entire coding sequence by polymerase chain reaction. We found in the products of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that amplify the segment spanning exons 2-7, in addition to a normal fragment, two smaller size fragments, one of which is also seen in normal control fibroblasts. The analysis of the patient's specific abnormal fragment by hybridization with exon-specific oligonucleotides and then sequencing allowed us to conclude that this fragment lacked exon 5. The other smaller species lacked exons 4 and 5 in both patient and normal control. The sequence of a genomic fragment containing exon 5 and of the patient's normal cDNA fragment spanning exons 2-7, revealed a point mutation G to A at the last nucleotide of exon 5. This mutation doesn't change the sense of the affected codon. Northern blot of patient's fibroblast poly(A+) RNAs allowed us to quantify two of the forms of transcripts seen by PCR. In the patient, the normal size transcript and the exon 5-deleted transcript represent, respectively, 3 and 7% of the normal control beta-hexosaminidase alpha mRNA. We propose that this point mutation is responsible for an inefficient and abnormal processing of the mutant transcript resulting in the appearance of two low abundance spliced mRNAs. One is lacking exon 5 and most likely codes for an inactive protein; the other is similar to normal beta-hexosaminidase alpha mRNA, except for the presence of the silent G to A mutation and codes therefore for a normal enzyme accounting for the 2.5% residual beta-hexosaminidase A activity measured in patient's fibroblasts by a fluorometric assay. The third form, without exons 4 and 5, is also evidenced in normal fibroblasts by PCR so that we think that it is not related to Tay-Sachs disease."

https://openalex.org/W1542193956,"It has been previously shown that a class of microtubule proteins, the so-called microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), binds to the C-terminal part of tubulin subunits. We show here that microtubules composed of tubulin whose 4-kDa C-terminal domain was cleaved by subtilisin (S-microtubules) are unable to bind MAPs but can still bind the anterograde translocator protein kinesin and the retrograde translocator dynein. Binding of both motors to S-microtubules, like their binding to normal microtubules, was ATP-dependent. In addition, direct competition experiments showed that binding sites for kiensin and MAPs on the microtubule surface lattice do not overlap. Furthermore, S-microtubules stimulated the ATPase activity of kinesin at least 8-fold, and the affinities of kinesin for control and S-microtubules were identical. S-microtubules were able to glide along kinesin-coated coverslips at a rate of 0.2 microns/s, the same rate as control microtubules. We conclude, that unlike MAPs, kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein bind to the tubulin molecule outside the C-terminal region."
https://openalex.org/W1576285340,"Cloned uncG genes (wild-type or in vitro mutagenized) for the Escherichia coli gamma subunit were introduced into the uncG mutant Gln-14----end), and the functions of the mutant subunits were studied. The F1's with Ala-283----end and Thr-277----end mutant gamma subunits had 63 and 14% of the wild-type ATPase activity, respectively, and mutants with these subunits showed reduced growth by oxidative phosphorylation, indicating that the 10 residues at the carboxyl terminus (286th residue) are important, but dispensable, for catalysis. On the other hand, F1 with a Gln-269----end gamma subunit was inactive. Replacement of conserved residues (Gln-269, Thr-273, or Glu-275) between Gln-269 and Leu-276 gave enzymes with significantly reduced ATPase activity (2-41% of that of the wild-type) and lower ATP-driven proton conduction. Thus these residues are required for the normal catalytic activity of F1, although they are not absolutely essential. Membranes with amino acid replacements (Thr-277----end, Gln-269----Leu, or Glu-275----Lys) and the frameshift mutation (downstream of Thr-277) had about 15% of the wild-type ATPase activity, but showed different degrees of ATP-dependent H+ translocation and growth yield by oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting that the gamma subunit, especially its carboxyl-terminal region, functions in coupling between catalysis and H+ translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1593862980,"Interleukin-1 proteins elicit a number of biological activities, but the molecular events following formation of a cell surface receptor-ligand complex have not been well defined. Conversion of Arg127 to Gly127 in the mature human interleukin-1 beta protein reduces bioactivity by 100-fold while the receptor binding affinity decreases by only 25%. The results suggest that the mutant IL-1 beta protein is defective in activating signal transduction events and indicate that binding of interleukin-1 beta protein to receptor is necessary but insufficient for biological activity. The finding that the features of the IL-1 beta protein responsible for receptor binding and biological activity are at least in part distinct may be clinically relevant to the design of interleukin-1 antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W1552394997,"The role of UvrB in determining the nucleotide dependence of Escherichia coli excision repair has been investigated. The mutation of lysine 45 in the ATPase motif of UvrB to alanine leads to an acute defect in ATP hydrolysis and failure to support incision of UV-damaged DNA. This ATP hydrolysis activity is not required for interaction of UvrB with UvrA in solution, or for formation of a damage-independent nucleoprotein complex in the presence of UvrA and nucleotide. This UvrB mutant fails, however, to support damage-specific nucleoprotein complex formation, and does not participate in a UvrA-UvrB-dependent helicase-like activity. We conclude from these results that mutation at lysine 45 in the ATPase motif of UvrB specifically inhibits a key step in nucleotide excision repair involving the UvrB ATPase-dependent translocation of nucleoprotein complexes from undamaged to damaged DNA sites."
https://openalex.org/W2121152152,"Two adenine nucleotide binding sites of chloroplast coupling factor 1 (CF1) were shown previously to switch their properties after exposure of the enzyme to Mg2(+)-ATP or Ca2(+)-ATP (Shapiro, A. B., and McCarty, R. E. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 14160-14165). The change in binding properties was monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer between Lucifer Yellow vinyl sulfone covalently bound to one alpha subunit and trinitrophenyl-ATP (TNP-ATP) tightly bound to nucleotide binding site 1. When the nucleotide binding properties of sites 1 and 3 switch during catalysis, site 3, which is nearer Lucifer Yellow than site 1, switches its nucleotide binding properties with site 1, allowing TNP-ATP to become tightly bound near Lucifer Yellow. The smaller separation allows energy transfer to occur, resulting in decreased Lucifer Yellow fluorescence. In this paper, we show that adenylyl-beta,gamma-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) bound to CF1 and caused nucleotide binding sites 1 and 3 to switch properties, but was not hydrolyzed. Using AMP-PNP, we also found that relaxation of the properties of the sites to the precatalysis state after removal of substrate occurred in the absence of hydrolysis of the last bound nucleotide. When Mg2+ was omitted during exposure of CF1 to ATP, there was very little hydrolysis or nucleotide site switching. When Mg2+ was added to a very low concentration which was more than stoichiometric with CF1, however, site switching occurred at its maximal level with virtually no increase in ATP hydrolysis. These results support a model in which binding of substrate Mg2(+)-ATP, not hydrolysis, causes the putative catalytic sites to switch properties, in agreement with the alternating site catalytic cooperativity hypothesis (Boyer, P. D. (1989) FASEB J. 3, 2164-2178). TNP-ATP, the fluorescence acceptor, did not cause nucleotide site switching when incubated with CF1 in the presence of EDTA to eliminate free Mg2+. Two possible additional nucleotide binding sites were detected, in addition to the three well characterized sites. At least one of these sites was close to the Lucifer Yellow site, judging by the amount of energy transfer caused by partial occupancy with TNP-ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1493832313,"The ganglioside fraction of human gastric mucosa was analyzed with a newly established anti-GM2 monoclonal antibody KM531. Using this antibody, accumulation of GM2 was observed in all of four cases of gastric carcinoma. In all ganglioside fractions extracted from normal gastric mucosa obtained from eight cases of peptic ulcer GM2 itself was not detected, but three kinds of glycolipid showing slower mobility than GM2 on thin-layer plates were detected by immunostaining with KM531. These glycolipids were assigned as NGM-1, -2, and -3. They were completely lost in all carcinoma tissues and in non-cancerous gastric mucosa from two cases of gastric cancer, and they were also not detected in the ganglioside fraction of small or large intestine. Of these glycolipids, the major one, NGM-1, was isolated from the pooled ganglioside fraction of normal gastric mucosa obtained from cases of peptic ulcer. The structure was determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance, negative ion fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and treatment with exoglycosidases and mild acid hydrolysis. The structure was GalNAc beta 1----4(NeuAc alpha 2----3) Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----3 Gal beta 1----4Glc beta 1----1Cer, which has the same terminal sequence as GM2 but has internal neolacto series structure. This epitope was previously identified as Cad blood group antigen. The decrease of this glycolipid and the increase of GM2 was considered to be a cancer-associated change in gastric mucosa."
https://openalex.org/W1507093689,"An intrinsic ATPase inhibitor and 9-kDa protein are regulatory factors of mitochondrial ATP synthase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A gene encoding the ATPase inhibitor was isolated from a yeast genomic library with synthetic oligonucleotides as hybridization probes and was sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence showed that the precursor protein contains an amino-terminal presequence of 22 amino acid residues. Mutant strains that did not contain the inhibitor and/or the 9-kDa protein were constructed by transformation of cells with their in vitro disrupted genes. The disruption of the chromosomal copy in recombinant cells was verified by Southern blot analysis, and the absence of the proteins in the mutant cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis. All the mutants could grow on a nonfermentable carbon source and the oxidative phosphorylation activities of their isolated mitochondria were the same as that of normal mitochondria. However, an uncoupler, carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone, induced marked ATP hydrolysis in the inhibitor-deficient mitochondria, but not in normal mitochondria. These observations suggest that the ATPase inhibitor inhibits ATP hydrolysis by F1F0-ATPase only when the membrane potential is lost."

https://openalex.org/W1524879891,"The predicted amino acid sequence of the alpha subunit of the rat liver mitochondrial ATP synthase has been obtained by sequencing a cDNA for the alpha subunit. Analysis of the sequence shows that it contains the A and B consensus sequences found in many nucleotide-binding proteins. Twelve amino acids of the rat liver alpha subunit differ from the sequence of the bovine heart alpha subunit; four of these involve differences in charge. The rat liver alpha subunit, from arginine 15 to the C-terminal proline 510, has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli using the alkaline phosphatase promoter (phoA) and leader peptide to direct the export of the expressed protein to the bacterial periplasm. By treating the cells with lysozyme, osmotic shock, and alkaline pH washes, the alpha subunit can be extracted in high yield (greater than 25 mg/liter) and in a high state of purity. The expressed alpha subunit remains soluble at pH 9.5 or greater and precipitates when treated with Mg2+ ions at low millimolar concentration. The bacterially expressed alpha subunit interacts with 2'(3')-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate (TNP-ATP), resulting in a marked fluorescence enhancement upon binding. An enhancement of fluorescence is also observed upon the interaction of the alpha subunit with TNP-ADP. Preincubating the alpha subunit with 1.5 mM ATP significantly reduces the fluorescence enhancement seen with TNP-ATP. The alpha subunit binds TNP-ATP with an apparent Kd in the low micromolar range (1-5 microM) and binds TNP-ADP with an affinity at least 10-fold lower. This work shows that the rat liver alpha subunit can be overexpressed in E. coli to yield a large amount of functional protein. With the acquisition of the overexpressed alpha subunit, it is now possible to test the reconstitution of ATPase activity from a mixture of recombinant and rat liver-derived subunits and to test the formation of complexes by the overexpressed alpha and beta subunits of the rat liver F1-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1536024176,"The relative abundance of the two conformers (E1 and E2) of the Ca2(+)-ATPase of plasma membranes and the rates of their interconversion were estimated measuring the initial velocity of phosphorylation of the Ca2(+)-ATPase in pig red cell membranes at 37 degrees C. This was based on the hypothesis that only E1 catalyzes phosphorylation from ATP. In the absence of ligands near 90% of the Ca2(+)-ATPase was in the E2 conformation. Ca2+ shifted the equilibrium toward E1. The K0.5 of Ca2+ for this effect was 15 microM, suggesting that it acted at the transport site. The conversion of E2 into E1 was slow (t1/2 = 911 s) while the conversion of E1 into E2 was faster (t1/2 less than or equal to 60 s). Mg2+ accelerated the E2----E1 reaction lowering its t1/2 to 0.25 s. In the presence of 4 mM Ca2+ t1/2 was 7.8 s, as if at this concentration to some extent Ca2+ replaced Mg2+ in accelerating the E2----E1 reaction. Results suggest that in intact membranes at 37 degrees C Ca2+ stabilized E1 and that the Ca2(+)-induced E2----E1 transition was strongly accelerated by Mg2+. Both cations were effective at near physiological concentrations and in the absence of other ligands like ATP or calmodulin that could also modify the reaction. After partial proteolysis with trypsin the Ca2(+)-ATPase behaved during phosphorylation as if it were E1."
https://openalex.org/W1558356826,"The lysosomal hydrolase beta-hexosaminidase (beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase, EC 3.2.1.52) exists as two major isozymes in normal human tissue: an acidic A-form and a basic B-form. There are also minor forms of intermediate pI known as I-forms. Increases in one or more of these intermediates have been associated with various disease states. Although the two major isozymes have been extensively studied, the structure and biosynthetic origins of the I-forms are unknown. Characterization of a placental hexosaminidase I-form, presented in this report, demonstrates that it is composed of two forms of partially processed hexosaminidase A. The major form contains an intact pro-alpha chain and a pro-beta chain lacking 2 residues from its amino terminus (Ala and Arg). The minor form also contains an alpha and a beta subunit, but each has undergone further proteolytic processing. The amino terminus of each of these partially processed polypeptide chains matches one of those previously found on stable processing intermediates in a single normal human fibroblast cell line. These data confirm that similar processing intermediates exist in human placenta, suggesting that this I-form lacks a unique enzymatic function in vivo. A sequence of normal proteolytic processing events is postulated."
https://openalex.org/W1562882205,"The radiolabeled thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 (TXA2/PGH2) agonist 125I-BOP bound to the TXA2/PGH2 receptor on human platelet membranes. Scatchard analysis showed that pretreatment of platelet membranes with the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) (10 mM) for 10 min decreased maximal 125I-BOP binding (Bmax) from 1.51 +/- 0.11 pmol/mg to 0.51 +/- 0.05 pmol/mg (p = 0.001) and increased the affinity of the remaining binding sites (Kd = 647 +/- 64 pM (untreated), 363 +/- 46 pM (treated), p = 0.006). Prolonged incubation of membranes with DTT (10 mM) for 40 min further reduced the Bmax to 0.23 +/- 0.08 pmol/mg (p = 0.001 from untreated), and the binding affinity remained elevated (Kd = 334 +/- 117 pM, p = 0.035 from untreated). Kinetic analysis of 125I-BOP binding indicated that the apparent increase in binding affinity after DTT treatment was due exclusively to an increase in the rate of ligand-receptor association with no change in dissociation rate. The effects of DTT on 125I-BOP binding were dose-dependent with an EC50 of 8.1 +/- 0.2 mM. DTT inactivation of TXA2/PGH2 receptors was time-dependent with a second order rate constant (k2) of 0.123 M-1 s-1 at 20 degrees C. The platelet membrane 125I-BOP binding site was partially protected from DTT inactivation by prior occupation with the ligand. TXA2/PGH2 receptor protection by I-BOP was dose-dependent and linearly related (r = 0.97, p = 0.002) to the proportion of receptors occupied, but was incomplete since agonist occupation of 89% of the total number of receptors resulted in only a 38% protective effect. Inhibition of 125I-BOP binding after reduction with DTT could be made permanent by addition of the sulfhydryl alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide (25 mM), but was completely reversed by reoxidation with dithionitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) (5 mM). Oxidation of untreated receptors with DTNB resulted in a 64% increase in 125I-BOP binding sites from 1.65 +/- 0.12 pmol/mg to 2.70 +/- 0.08 pmol/mg (p = 0.013) without affecting binding affinity. DTNB-induced increases in 125I-BOP binding were concentration-dependent with an EC50 of 668 +/- 106 microM and occurred in less than 1 min at 37 degrees C. In the absence of DTT, alkylation of free sulfhydryl groups with N-ethylmaleimide reduced 125I-BOP Bmax in platelet membranes to 0.85 +/- 0.08 pmol/mg (p = 0.003), but did not change the affinity of the remaining receptors. The EC50 for N-ethylmaleimide inactivation of TXA2/PGH2 receptors was 139 +/- 8 mM, and the k2 in time course experiments was 0.067 M-1 s-1 at 20 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1799620400,"This study gives an account of the biologic and kinetic binding properties of interleukin 1Î± (IL 1Î±), interleukin 1Î² (IL 1Î²), and Glu-4 (an NH2-terminal mutant of IL 1Î²) to interleukin 1 (IL 1) receptors in rabbit articular chondrocytes. All three IL 1's demonstrated full agonist properties in their ability to stimulate prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis. IL 1Î± was 23-fold more biologically active than IL 1Î², which was around 110-fold more active than Glu-4 based on the concentration of IL 1 required for half-maximal stimulation of PGE2. The binding of all three ligands was concentration-dependent and saturable at 4Â°C. Scatchard analysis of receptor binding data showed that the dissociation constant (KD) of IL 1Î± was 46 Â± 12 pM, and the receptor density was 3120 sites/cell. The association of IL 1Î± at 4Â°C did not attain equilibrium until after 10 h at 100 pM of 125I-labeled IL 1Î±. The dissociation of bound IL 1Î± was very slow, t1/2 of 21 h, although only one class of high-affinity receptors was detected. The KD of IL 1Î² binding was 72 Â± 3 pM with a receptor density of 800 Â± 40 sites/cell. Dissociation of bound 125I-labeled IL 1Î² at 4Â°C appeared to indicate the presence of two receptor subsets, a fast and a slower component with a t1/2 of 2 min and 5 h, respectively. The receptor binding affinity of Glu-4 was 324 Â± 3 pM, in line with its reduced biologic activity. Both IL la and IL 1Î² are rapidly internalized in chondrocytes in a time- and temperature-dependent manner.â Chin, J. E.; Horuk, R.

https://openalex.org/W1516363208,"We investigated the 5'-upstream region of the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the V-type H(+)-ATPase in Daucus carota. A genomic sublibrary was screened with a cDNA probe, and a 4-kilobase genomic clone was obtained covering the first two exons and about 3 kilobases of the 5'-upstream sequence. The intron/exon boundaries matched established consensus sequences. Within 240 base pairs (bp) upstream of the initiation codon three putative TATA boxes were found. Ribonuclease protection and primer extension analysis indicated that the three TATA boxes corresponded to two major and one minor transcription start sites. The flanking sequences of the two more proximal TATA boxes were nearly identical. Additional sequence motifs with putative regulatory function are two CCAAT boxes, an Sp1-binding consensus sequence, and long (TATA)n stretches within 800 bp of the 5'-upstream sequence. Transcriptional fusions to the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene were made for two different promoter constructs, and the resulting plasmids were mobilized into Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The analysis of beta-glucuronidase activities in the transformed carrot calli showed that 240 bp of the upstream sequence, including all three TATA boxes, led to low but detectable beta-glucuronidase expression; however, the larger construct, which included the putative Sp1-binding sequence and the (TATA)n stretches, led to an approximately 6-fold higher beta-glucuronidase expression. Histochemical analysis of beta-glucuronidase activity in the transformed calli showed no preferential expression in any specific cell type, in keeping with the presumed housekeeping character of the V-type H(+)-ATPase catalytic subunit gene."
https://openalex.org/W1574318499,"The plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase of Neurospora crassa was treated with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) to determine its cysteine content and with 2-nitro-5-thiosulfobenzoate to determine its cystine content. Six and seven mol of thiols/mol of H(+)-ATPase were detected in the 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) and 2-nitro-5-thiosulfobenzoate reactions, respectively, indicating that 6 of the 8 cysteine residues in the molecule are present as free cysteines and that 2 are present in disulfide linkage. The results of quantitative carboxymethylation experiments using [14C]iodoacetate under nonreducing and reducing conditions fully support this conclusion. Preparations of the ATPase 14C carboxymethylated under the above conditions were treated with trypsin, and the tryptic digests were resolved into hydrophilic and hydrophobic peptide fractions by our recently published procedure (Rao, U.S., Hennessey, J.P., Jr., and Scarborough, G.A. (1988) Anal. Biochem. 173, 251-264). Five of the six labeled free cysteine peptides partitioned into the hydrophilic peptide fraction and were purified and established to contain Cys376, Cys409, Cys472, Cys532, and Cys545. The labeled free cysteine residue in the hydrophobic peptide fraction was identified as either Cys840 or Cys869 by virtue of its presence in a large approximately 21-kDa hydrophobic peptide established previously to begin at Ser660. This in turn identified either Cys840 or Cys869 as one of the disulfide bridge cysteines. The other disulfide bridge cysteine was identified as Cys148 by purification and NH2-terminal sequencing of an additional peptide labeled in the reduced enzyme. The disulfide bridge is therefore between Cys148 and either Cys840 or Cys869. Because Cys148 is present in a putative membrane-embedded sector near the NH2 terminus of the ATPase molecule and Cys840 and Cys869 are present in a similar sector near the COOH terminus, it is possible that the disulfide bridge plays an important structural role in holding the two major membrane-embedded sectors of the molecule, distant in the linear sequence, together."
https://openalex.org/W1554668271,"In the rat, intrarenal infusion of epidermal growth factor decreases renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces contraction of cultured rat mesangial cells. The present studies examined the role of arachidonic acid metabolites in this response. Intrarenal EGF infusion increased urinary iPGF2Î± by 300%, and in isolated glomeruli EGF stimulated iPGF2Î± by 38%, but did not affect thromboxane B2 production. Furthermore, the thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist, SQ29548, did not block EGF's vasoconstrictive effects. After selective cyclooxygenase inhibition with ibuprofen, intrarenal EGF infusion no longer produced local vasoconstriction but instead led to systemic vasodilation (SBP: 117 Â± 10 vs. 98 Â± 7; n = 5; P < 0.05) that was accompanied by significant increases in RPF (3.8 Â± 0.4 vs. 5.6 Â± 0.2; P < 0.01) and glomerular filtration rate (0.9 Â± 0.1 vs. 1.1 Â± 0.1; P < 0.05). When total arachidonate metabolism was inhibited by the additional administration of 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid, the EGF-induced vasodilation observed during cyclooxygenase inhibition alone was abolished, and vasoconstrictor responses to EGF were again noted. Similar effects were noted with concomitant administration of the C-P450 inhibitor ketoconazole. EGF's vasoconstrictive effects were unaltered by the simultaneous administration of the angiotensin II antagonist saralasin. Thus, the renal hemodynamic responses to EGF are mediated in part by arachidonic acid metabolites. Cyclooxygenase inhibition unmasks a potent renal and systemic vasodilator action of EGF owing to its stimulation of systemic release of noncyclooxygenase arachidonate metabolites.â Harris, R.

https://openalex.org/W1486868163,"Xanthurenic acid 8-glucoside is a side metabolite of the tryptophan-xanthommatin pathway in Drosophila. From 3-hydroxykynurenine, two biosynthetic pathways can be envisaged, one via xanthurenic acid, and another via 3-O-glucoside of 3-hydroxykynurenine. In this report evidence is presented to show that the synthesis takes place via xanthurenic acid. (a) We have demonstrated that the Drosophila melanogaster vermilion purple mutant (unable to synthesize 3-hydroxykynurenine) synthesizes xanthurenic acid 8-glucoside when fed with xanthurenic acid; and (b) the activities required for its synthesis via xanthurenic acid have been found (3-hydroxykynurenine transaminase and xanthurenic acid:UDP-glucosyltransferase). This is the first time that a UDP-glucosyltransferase activity that utilizes xanthurenic acid has been demonstrated. The enzyme in crude extracts from Drosophila sordidula shows the following characteristics. (a) It has optimal activity at 35 degrees C at pH 7.1 (in buffer Tris-HCl), and in the presence of a divalent cation (Mg2+ or Mn2+); (b) the activity is inhibited by xanthurenic acid (above 1.5 mM), UDP, D-gluconic acid 1,5-lactone, and Triton X-100; (c) it is localized in both the microsomal and the soluble fractions; (d) the specific activity is two times higher in heads than in bodies; and (e) the activity is enhanced in flies fed with phenobarbital."
https://openalex.org/W1502334661,"Diethyl pyrocarbonate was used to modify histidyl residues on the sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase. Difference spectra of the N-carbethoxyhistidyl derivative indicated that most all the histidyl residues on the enzyme had been modified. These residues could be divided into two populations on the basis of their reaction rate with the reagent. It could then be shown that enzyme inhibition followed modification of the slower reacting population. Reversal with hydroxylamine verified that the loss of activity was due specifically to histidyl modification. Using [32P]ATP as a substrate it was further determined that the modified ATPase could form a phosphoenzyme intermediate, but that the hydrolysis of this intermediate was inhibited. Size exclusion chromatography was used to obtain equilibrium binding curves for high affinity Ca2+ sites on the enzyme. With the normal ATPase a cooperative binding curve for two Ca2+ with a Hill coefficient of 1.8 was observed. With the modified ATPase binding to two independent sites was observed; however, the dissociation constants remained the same as in the cooperative mechanism (K1 = 14 microM; K2 = 0.5 microM). That is, modification had eliminated cooperativity without changing the site specific binding affinities. E-P formation was then shown to follow binding to the higher affinity of the two sites. This would be the second site to bind Ca2+ in a sequential, cooperative mechanism. A model is suggested in which the binding of Ca2+ to an initial site allows for the binding of a second Ca2+ to an occluded site, this second site being responsible for enzyme activation. Modification apparently allows the binding properties of both sites to be observed independently."

(1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 11410-11412) was found to completely inhibit the acto-S-1 (myosin subfragment 1) ATPase activity. The effect of the heptapeptide on the binding ability of S-1 for F-actin was determined by an ultracentrifugal separation. Results indicated that the heptapeptide scarcely dissociated the acto-S-1 complex during the ATPase reaction. Consistent results were obtained from the acto-S-1 ATPase activities determined as a function of S-1 concentrations in the absence or presence of the heptapeptide at a fixed F-actin concentration. The heptapeptide reduced the maximum acto-S-1 ATPase activity without affecting the apparent dissociation constant of the acto-S-1 complex. The heptapeptide bound by a site on actin complementary to the S-site probably inhibits the activation of S-1 ATPase by F-actin. These results suggest that S-1 ATPase is necessary to rebind transiently with F-actin at the S-site in order to be activated by F-actin. This is consistent with the activation mechanism proposed assuming the two actin-binding sites on S-1 ATPase (Katoh, T., and Morita F. (1984) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 96, 1223-1230)."

https://openalex.org/W1487582206,"Abstract A phospho-oligosaccharide, whose production is stimulated by insulin, modulated the activity of partially purified casein kinase II. Whereas at 2 microM the phospho-oligosaccharide stimulated casein kinase II 1.3-fold, higher concentrations of this molecule were inhibitory. 50% inhibition of the enzyme was obtained at 15 microM phospho-oligosaccharide. This biphasic effect of the phospho-oligosaccharide on casein kinase II activity was observed using as substrate both casein or the specific peptide for casein kinase II, Arg-Arg-Arg-Glu-Glu-Glu-Thr-Glu-Glu-Glu. The effect of the phospho-oligosaccharide on casein kinase II was still observed after gel filtration. Deamination of the phospho-oligosaccharide with nitrous acid abolished both the activation and the inhibition of casein kinase II. The glycophospholipid precursor of the phospho-oligosaccharide did not affect casein kinase II activity. Moreover, modulation of casein kinase II activity was not observed with other compounds structurally related to the phospho-oligosaccharide, when used in the micro-molar range. In conclusion, the present results indicate that the phospho-oligosaccharide that mimics and might mediate some of the actions of insulin modulates casein kinase II activity in vitro."
