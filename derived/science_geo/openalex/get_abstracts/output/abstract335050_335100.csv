https://openalex.org/W2029551638,"Clusters of metal ions are a class of compounds actively investigated for their magnetic properties, which should gradually change from those of simple paramagnets to those of bulk magnets. However, their interest lies in a number of different disciplines: chemistry, which seeks new synthetic strategies to make larger and larger clusters in a controlled manner; physics, which can test the validity of quantum mechanical approaches at the nanometer scale; and biology, which can use them as models of biomineralization of magnetic particles."
https://openalex.org/W1964009112,"Parasites are thought to maximize the number of successfully transmitted offspring by trading off propagule production against host survival. In a horizontally transmitted microparasitic disease in Daphnia, a planktonic crustacean, increasing geographic distance between host and parasite origin was found to be correlated with a decrease in spore production and virulence. This finding indicates local adaptation of the parasite, but contradicts the hypothesis that long-standing coevolved parasites are less virulent than novel parasites. Virulence can be explained as the consequence of balancing the positive genetic correlation between host mortality and strain-specific spore production."

Partial oxidation under toluene transformed these crystals into bundles of fibers. The degree of polymerization exceeded 100,000."
https://openalex.org/W1989978279,"Diode laser-pumped solid-state lasers are efficient, compact, all solid-state sources of coherent optical radiation. Major advances in solid-state laser technology have historically been preceded by advances in pumping technology. The helical flash lamps used to pump early ruby lasers were superseded by the linear flash lamp and arc lamp now used to pump neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet lasers. The latest advance in pumping technology is the diode laser. Diode laser-pumped neodymium lasers have operated at greater than 10 percent electrical to optical efficiency in a single spatial mode and with linewidths of less than 10 kilohertz. The high spectral power brightness of these lasers has allowed frequency extension by harmonic generation in nonlinear crystals, which has led to green and blue sources of coherent radiation. Diode laser pumping has also been used with ions other than neodymium to produce wavelengths from 946 to 2010 nanometers. In addition, Q-switched operation with kilowatt peak powers and mode-locked operation with 10-picosecond pulse widths have been demonstrated. Progress in diode lasers and diode laser arrays promises all solid-state lasers in which the flash lamp is replaced by diode lasers for average power levels in excess of tens of watts and at a price that is competitive with flash lamp-pumped laser systems. Power levels exceeding 1 kilowatt appear possible within the next 5 years. Potential applications of diode laser-pumped solid-state lasers include coherent radar, global sensing from satellites, medical uses, micromachining, and miniature visible sources for digital optical storage."
https://openalex.org/W2131285617,"Stable ten-component sandwich compounds have been characterized in which four lithium ions reside between two tetraanions derived from corannulene or its alkyl-substituted derivatives and four additional lithium ions decorate the exterior. In tetrahydrofuran solution, the four lithium ions inside the sandwich can exchange environments with the four external lithium atoms, but the two tetraanion decks of the sandwich never separate from one another on the time scale of nuclear magnetic resonance. Theoretical calculations point to a ""stacked bowl"" conformation and a low energy barrier for synchronous double inversion of the tetraanion bowls in the solvated sandwich compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2081184096,"The scaling of the cubic nonlinearity gamma with chain length in polyenic molecules has received considerable theoretical attention. Earlier experimental investigations have been restricted to oligomers with fewer than 20 double bonds because of problems associated with the synthesis and solubility of conjugated molecules. These synthetic difficulties have been overcome in the present study by the use of modern living polymerization techniques. Solution measurements of gamma as a function of chain length in long-chain (up to 240 double bonds) model polyene oligomers are reported. A saturation of the increase of gamma with chain length is observed, and the onset of this saturation occurs for chain lengths considerably longer than predicted from theory."
https://openalex.org/W2036240504,"Tree rings from three dendrochronologically dated bristlecone pines were analyzed for stable hydrogen isotopic composition. These trees give a continuous time series from 8000 years ago to the present that indicates the presence of a postglacial climate optimum 6800 years ago and a continuous cooling since then. The qualitative agreement between this record and records from other sources, such as ice cores, pollen, and treeline fluctuations, indicates that these climate changes were global. This record can serve as a reference for other climate indicators throughout the past 8000 years."
https://openalex.org/W2064518947,"Air pollution can cause a decline in species through acidification of the habitat. New data suggest that the decline may be due to eutrophication rather than acidification. In Western Europe, eutrophication largely results from atmospheric ammonium deposition. The amount deposited on vegetation is a function of its canopy structure. Deposition on grasslands has been underestimated, and a significant amount of the deposited ammonium appears to be assimilated by the plant canopy. These quantities are sufficient to initiate changes in the competitive relations among the plant species."
https://openalex.org/W1988214783,"Computer simulations and experimental studies were combined to design copolymers that enhance the strength of polymer composites. These copolymers contain side chains that associate across the boundary between phase-separated regions to form a ""molecular velcro"" that effectively binds the regions together. This behavior significantly improves the structural integrity and mechanical properties of the material. Because the side chains can be fabricated from a large class of compounds, the technique greatly increases the variety of copolymers that can be used in forming high-strength polymer blends."
https://openalex.org/W2034597825,"The superconducting transport characteristics of HgBa(2) CaCu(2)O(6+delta) (Hg-1212) films and grain-boundary junctions grown on (100)-oriented SrTiO(3) bicrystal substrates have been investigated. The films exhibit a zero-resistance temperature of approximately 120 kelvin and sustain large critical current densities, with values as high as 10(6) amperes per square centimeter at around 100 kelvin. On the other hand, the grain boundaries behave as weak links, with substantially lower critical currents, as is observed for other cuprate superconductors. A reduction of three orders of magnitude in critical current was observed for transport across a 36.8 degrees grain boundary. The current-voltage characteristics of bridges across such a grain boundary show weak-link behavior qualitatively resembling that of a resistively shunted junction. Single-level direct-current superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) have been fabricated with such bicrystal junctions. These SQUIDs show clear periodic voltage modulations when subjected to applied magnetic fields. The SQUIDs operate at temperatures as high as 111.8 kelvin, which makes them attractive for operation in portable sensors and devices that utilize nonconventional cooling methods."
https://openalex.org/W2031651805,"Certain opaque inclusions within primitive meteorites exhibit textures that suggest chondrules formed during intense, short-duration radiative heating episodes in the early solar system. Experimental support for this interpretation is provided by the textures produced when chondrule-like assemblages are heated with visible laser light. Computer simulations of radiative heating provide additional evidence for the role of electromagnetic energy in heating nebular solids by offering an explanation for the size distributions of chondrules and the presence of dusty chondrule rims. Nebular lightning and magnetic reconnection flares are possible sources of electromagnetic energy for these transient heating events."
https://openalex.org/W2007260328,"Stream networks are sensitive to low rates of surface uplift and can be used to decipher the history of large earthquakes even where faults do not rupture the surface, as in intraplate seismic zones. Statistical analysis of alluvial network data from topographic maps in the New Madrid seismic zone, in the central United States, shows that stream-segment gradients deviate the most from an estimated natural stream profile where surface uplift is greatest. Evidence of cumulative deformation distilled from stream network patterns represents at least several meters of differential surface uplift during Holocene time, which suggests that more than one cycle of surface deformation occurred."

https://openalex.org/W2078526400,"Wave equations govern the propagation of acoustical or optical fields in diverse physical settings of interest to oceanographers, geologists, atmospheric scientists, among others. For wavelengths much smaller than all other length scales in the system the wave equation solution is generally expressed as a superposition of waveforms, each of which is determined by properties of the rays of geometrical acoustics or optics. Typically such solutions are accurate except in the vicinity of one or another caustic surface such as those defined as a surface across which a jump in the number of rays tracing through each point occurs. When numerous caustic surfaces exist, which is the generic situation, standard asymptotic solutions prove unsuitable. In this report a new asymptotic expression that overcomes deficiencies in previous approximations is introduced and characterized in an elementary way."

https://openalex.org/W1667460347,"The U.S. Treasury may be awash in excess revenue, but so far this year many science programs are feeling parched. At the midpoint of the annual budget cycle, health and defense agencies appear headed for large increases, while the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, NASA, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology are facing a fiscal drought compared to their requests. A lot could change before the 2001 fiscal year begins in October, however."
https://openalex.org/W2055178048,"The new superconducting material containing bismuth, copper, strontium, calcium, oxygen, and (optionally) aluminum is discussed. It is pointed out that it is cheaper to make, shows superconductivity at 120 K, and represents a third fundamentally distinct class of high-temperature superconductors. In a telephone interview with the discoverer, he refused to discuss the exact formula of the material; however, the practical applications and stability of the material were extolled. Conversely, the difficulty of preparation was reported."

https://openalex.org/W2041992989,"Many users of small telescopes are disturbed by the trend of shutting down smaller instruments in order to help fund bigger and bolder ground-based telescopes. Small telescopes can thrive in the shadow of giant new observatories, they say--but only if they are adapted to specialized projects. Telescopes with apertures of 2 meters or less have unique abilities to monitor broad swaths of the sky and stare at the same objects night after night, sometimes for years; various teams are turning small telescopes into robots, creating networks that span the globe and devoting them to survey projects that big telescopes don't have a prayer of tackling."

Although some scientists applaud the idea, others say that it undermines the idea of a virtual institute and that operating costs would take money away from higher priorities. Two panels have offered conflicting opinions, which may be aired at a meeting next week."

https://openalex.org/W2017144241,"A team of researchers at Yale Medical School has uncovered a gene mutation that leads to early-onset hypertension that may point the way to causes for more common forms of high blood pressure. On page 119, the Yale group reports finding a new mutation in the so-called mineralocorticoid receptor, a protein in kidney cells that is involved in the body's handling of salt. This is the first work to demonstrate how alterations in the receptor could give rise to hypertension; in particular, the findings may explain why some women experience a sharp rise in blood pressure during pregnancy."
