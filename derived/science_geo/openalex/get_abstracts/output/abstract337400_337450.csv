https://openalex.org/W2089890819,"Pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harr.), reared for two successive generations on a diet made of 23 amino acids and amides, 11 watersoluble vitamins, 35 percent sucrose, salts, and cholesterol, remained apterous. They grew and developed during the first generation almost as well as those grown on pea plants, with very little mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2023043252,"Armillaria mellea produced abundant rhizomorphs when grown on a chemically defined medium containing ethanol at concentrations as low as 50 parts per million. In the absence of ethanol no rhizomorphs were formed. Rhizomorph production was also stimulated by I-propanol, isopropanol, and 1-butanol as well as by acetaldehyde (to a lesser extent). Potassium acetate had very slight stimulating effect, and methanol was completely ineffective."

https://openalex.org/W1967972063,"Taxonomnic diversity gradients appear to offer a quantitative paleontologic technique for obtaining ancient positions of the rotational pole of the earth. Statistical analysis of a model based on the taxonomic diversity of Recent planktonic foramninifera shows a close relationship to the latitudinal temperature gradient and, thus permits location of the pole. A similar analysis for Permian orthotetaceid brachiopods suggests a pole near the present position. A vailable data on diversity fit a present earth mizodel better than one based on Permian paleomagnetic results and thus suggest that it may be necesary to consider a model for the earth's magnetic field which does not require coincidence of the magnetic and rotational poles."

Rapid quenching produced a mixture of the monoclinic and tetragonal phases. The high-pressure specimens, when heated to 1200 degrees C in air and quenched, reverted to the all-monoclinic form."
https://openalex.org/W2075664292,"Although relative molar size has been considered a major taxonomic criterion, separating the Australopithecines and some erectus fossils from sapiens man, the Me > Ml, or "" fossil"" size sequence is found in 33 percent of Ohio whites and Pima Indians, yet is not necessarily the major sequence in the level and below ( 9; 10).

https://openalex.org/W2033973668,"Chromatographic analyses of unhydrolyzed flower extracts of two Lotus hybrids and of two individuals from an F(2) population have revealed the presence of a substance which was not present in the extracts of the parental species. This hybrid substance has not been identified, but its occurrence might be explained as the result of gene interaction in heterozygous individuals."

https://openalex.org/W2936486904,"It was as early as 1903 that the British physicists, McLennan and Burton(1) and Rutherford and Cooke(2) noticed that the rate of leakage of an electric charge from an electroscope within an air-tight metal chamber could be reduced as much as 30% by enclosing the chamber within a completely encircling metal shield or box with walls several centimeters thick. This meant that the loss of charge of the enclosed electroscope was not due to imperfectly insulating supports, but must rather be due to some highly penetrating rays, like the gamma rays of radium, which could pass through metal walls as much as a centimeter thick and ionize the gas inside."
