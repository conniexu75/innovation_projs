https://openalex.org/W2154679217,"Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from somatic cells provide a unique tool for the study of human disease, as well as a promising source for cell replacement therapies. One crucial limitation has been the inability to perform experiments under genetically defined conditions. This is particularly relevant for late age onset disorders in which in vitro phenotypes are predicted to be subtle and susceptible to significant effects of genetic background variations. By combining zinc finger nuclease (ZFN)-mediated genome editing and iPSC technology, we provide a generally applicable solution to this problem, generating sets of isogenic disease and control human pluripotent stem cells that differ exclusively at either of two susceptibility variants for Parkinson's disease by modifying the underlying point mutations in the α-synuclein gene. The robust capability to genetically correct disease-causing point mutations in patient-derived hiPSCs represents significant progress for basic biomedical research and an advance toward hiPSC-based cell replacement therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2098984214,"We wanted to learn whether activity in the same area(s) of the brain correlate with the experience of beauty derived from different sources. 21 subjects took part in a brain-scanning experiment using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Prior to the experiment, they viewed pictures of paintings and listened to musical excerpts, both of which they rated on a scale of 1–9, with 9 being the most beautiful. This allowed us to select three sets of stimuli–beautiful, indifferent and ugly–which subjects viewed and heard in the scanner, and rated at the end of each presentation. The results of a conjunction analysis of brain activity showed that, of the several areas that were active with each type of stimulus, only one cortical area, located in the medial orbito-frontal cortex (mOFC), was active during the experience of musical and visual beauty, with the activity produced by the experience of beauty derived from either source overlapping almost completely within it. The strength of activation in this part of the mOFC was proportional to the strength of the declared intensity of the experience of beauty. We conclude that, as far as activity in the brain is concerned, there is a faculty of beauty that is not dependent on the modality through which it is conveyed but which can be activated by at least two sources–musical and visual–and probably by other sources as well. This has led us to formulate a brain-based theory of beauty."
https://openalex.org/W2019824795,"Massively parallel sequencing of DNA molecules in the plasma of pregnant women has been shown to allow accurate and noninvasive prenatal detection of fetal trisomy 21. However, whether the sequencing approach is as accurate for the noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 13 and 18 is unclear due to the lack of data from a large sample set. We studied 392 pregnancies, among which 25 involved a trisomy 13 fetus and 37 involved a trisomy 18 fetus, by massively parallel sequencing. By using our previously reported standard z-score approach, we demonstrated that this approach could identify 36.0% and 73.0% of trisomy 13 and 18 at specificities of 92.4% and 97.2%, respectively. We aimed to improve the detection of trisomy 13 and 18 by using a non-repeat-masked reference human genome instead of a repeat-masked one to increase the number of aligned sequence reads for each sample. We then applied a bioinformatics approach to correct GC content bias in the sequencing data. With these measures, we detected all (25 out of 25) trisomy 13 fetuses at a specificity of 98.9% (261 out of 264 non-trisomy 13 cases), and 91.9% (34 out of 37) of the trisomy 18 fetuses at 98.0% specificity (247 out of 252 non-trisomy 18 cases). These data indicate that with appropriate bioinformatics analysis, noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 by maternal plasma DNA sequencing is achievable."
https://openalex.org/W2038784126,"Background K2 products are synthetic cannabinoid-laced, marijuana-like drugs of abuse, use of which is often associated with clinical symptoms atypical of marijuana use, including hypertension, agitation, hallucinations, psychosis, seizures and panic attacks. JWH-018, a prevalent K2 synthetic cannabinoid, is structurally distinct from Δ9-THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. Since even subtle structural differences can lead to differential metabolism, formation of novel, biologically active metabolites may be responsible for the distinct effects associated with K2 use. The present study proposes that K2's high adverse effect occurrence is due, at least in part, to distinct JWH-018 metabolite activity at the cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R). Methods/Principal Findings JWH-018, five potential monohydroxylated metabolites (M1–M5), and one carboxy metabolite (M6) were examined in mouse brain homogenates containing CB1Rs, first for CB1R affinity using a competition binding assay employing the cannabinoid receptor radioligand [3H]CP-55,940, and then for CB1R intrinsic efficacy using an [35S]GTPγS binding assay. JWH-018 and M1–M5 bound CB1Rs with high affinity, exhibiting Ki values that were lower than or equivalent to Δ9-THC. These molecules also stimulated G-proteins with equal or greater efficacy relative to Δ9-THC, a CB1R partial agonist. Most importantly, JWH-018, M2, M3, and M5 produced full CB1R agonist levels of activation. CB1R-mediated activation was demonstrated by blockade with O-2050, a CB1R-selective neutral antagonist. Similar to Δ9-THC, JWH-018 and M1 produced a marked depression of locomotor activity and core body temperature in mice that were both blocked by the CB1R-preferring antagonist/inverse agonist AM251. Conclusions/Significance Unlike metabolites of most drugs, the studied JWH-018 monohydroxylated compounds, but not the carboxy metabolite, retain in vitro and in vivo activity at CB1Rs. These observations, combined with higher CB1R affinity and activity relative to Δ9-THC, may contribute to the greater prevalence of adverse effects observed with JWH-018-containing products relative to cannabis."
https://openalex.org/W2044243244,"The scope and breadth of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions have continued to expand over the last decade. Herein, we introduce a genome-scale model for a plant with direct applications to food and bioenergy production (i.e., maize). Maize annotation is still underway, which introduces significant challenges in the association of metabolic functions to genes. The developed model is designed to meet rigorous standards on gene-protein-reaction (GPR) associations, elementally and charged balanced reactions and a biomass reaction abstracting the relative contribution of all biomass constituents. The metabolic network contains 1,563 genes and 1,825 metabolites involved in 1,985 reactions from primary and secondary maize metabolism. For approximately 42% of the reactions direct literature evidence for the participation of the reaction in maize was found. As many as 445 reactions and 369 metabolites are unique to the maize model compared to the AraGEM model for A. thaliana. 674 metabolites and 893 reactions are present in Zea mays iRS1563 that are not accounted for in maize C4GEM. All reactions are elementally and charged balanced and localized into six different compartments (i.e., cytoplasm, mitochondrion, plastid, peroxisome, vacuole and extracellular). GPR associations are also established based on the functional annotation information and homology prediction accounting for monofunctional, multifunctional and multimeric proteins, isozymes and protein complexes. We describe results from performing flux balance analysis under different physiological conditions, (i.e., photosynthesis, photorespiration and respiration) of a C4 plant and also explore model predictions against experimental observations for two naturally occurring mutants (i.e., bm1 and bm3). The developed model corresponds to the largest and more complete to-date effort at cataloguing metabolism for a plant species."
https://openalex.org/W2044406197,"Sustained expression of the histone demethylase, KDM2B (Ndy1/FBXL10/JHDM1B), bypasses cellular senescence in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Here, we show that KDM2B is a conserved regulator of lifespan in multiple primary cell types and defines a program in which this chromatin-modifying enzyme counteracts the senescence-associated down-regulation of the EZH2 histone methyltransferase. Senescence in MEFs epigenetically silences KDM2B and induces the tumor suppressor miRNAs let-7b and miR-101, which target EZH2. Forced expression of KDM2B promotes immortalization by silencing these miRNAs through locus-specific histone H3 K36me2 demethylation, leading to EZH2 up-regulation. Overexpression of let-7b down-regulates EZH2, induces premature senescence, and counteracts immortalization of MEFs driven by KDM2B. The KDM2B-let-7-EZH2 pathway also contributes to the proliferation of immortal Ink4a/Arf null fibroblasts suggesting that, beyond its anti-senescence role in primary cells, this histone-modifying enzyme functions more broadly in the regulation of cellular proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2025396422,"Heparanase acts as a master regulator of the aggressive tumor phenotype in part by enhancing expression of proteins known to drive tumor progression (e.g. VEGF, MMP-9, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and RANKL). However, the mechanism whereby this enzyme regulates gene expression remains unknown. We previously reported that elevation of heparanase levels in myeloma cells causes a dramatic reduction in the amount of syndecan-1 in the nucleus. Because syndecan-1 has heparan sulfate chains and because exogenous heparan sulfate has been shown to inhibit the activity of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) enzymes in vitro, we hypothesized that the reduction in nuclear syndecan-1 in cells expressing high levels of heparanase would result in increased HAT activity leading to stimulation of protein transcription. We found that myeloma cells or tumors expressing high levels of heparanase and low levels of nuclear syndecan-1 had significantly higher levels of HAT activity when compared with cells or tumors expressing low levels of heparanase. High levels of HAT activity in heparanase-high cells were blocked by SST0001, an inhibitor of heparanase. Restoration of high syndecan-1 levels in heparanase-high cells diminished nuclear HAT activity, establishing syndecan-1 as a potent inhibitor of HAT. Exposure of heparanase-high cells to anacardic acid, an inhibitor of HAT activity, significantly suppressed their expression of VEGF and MMP-9, two genes known to be up-regulated following elevation of heparanase. These results reveal a novel mechanistic pathway driven by heparanase expression, which leads to decreased nuclear syndecan-1, increased HAT activity, and up-regulation of transcription of multiple genes that drive an aggressive tumor phenotype.

The phylogenetic distribution of RtcB points to its candidacy as a tRNA splicing/repair enzyme. Here we show that Escherichia coli RtcB is competent and sufficient for tRNA splicing in vivo by virtue of its ability to complement growth of yeast cells that lack the endogenous “healing/sealing-type” tRNA ligase Trl1. RtcB also protects yeast trl1Δ cells against a fungal ribotoxin that incises the anticodon loop of cellular tRNAs. Moreover, RtcB can replace Trl1 as the catalyst of HAC1 mRNA splicing during the unfolded protein response. Thus, RtcB is a bona fide RNA repair enzyme with broad physiological actions. Biochemical analysis of RtcB highlights the uniqueness of its active site and catalytic mechanism. Our findings draw attention to tRNA ligase as a promising drug target.

https://openalex.org/W2164423702,"How the host cells of plants and animals protect themselves against fungal invasion is a biologically interesting and economically important problem. Here we investigate the mechanistic process that leads to death of Penicillium expansum, a widespread phytopathogenic fungus, by identifying the cellular compounds affected by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) that is frequently produced as a response of the host cells. We show that plasma membrane damage was not the main reason for H(2)O(2)-induced death of the fungal pathogen. Proteomic analysis of the changes of total cellular proteins in P. expansum showed that a large proportion of the differentially expressed proteins appeared to be of mitochondrial origin, implying that mitochondria may be involved in this process. We then performed mitochondrial sub-proteomic analysis to seek the H(2)O(2)-sensitive proteins in P. expansum. A set of mitochondrial proteins were identified, including respiratory chain complexes I and III, F(1)F(0) ATP synthase, and mitochondrial phosphate carrier protein. The functions of several proteins were further investigated to determine their effects on the H(2)O(2)-induced fungal death. Through fluorescent co-localization and the use of specific inhibitor, we provide evidence that complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain contributes to ROS generation in fungal mitochondria under H(2)O(2) stress. The undesirable accumulation of ROS caused oxidative damage of mitochondrial proteins and led to the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that ATP synthase is involved in the response of fungal pathogen to oxidative stress, because inhibition of ATP synthase by oligomycin decreases survival. Our data suggest that mitochondrial impairment due to functional alteration of oxidative stress-sensitive proteins is associated with fungal death caused by H(2)O(2)."
https://openalex.org/W2033241506,"Notch activity is regulated by both O-fucosylation and O-glucosylation, and Notch receptors contain multiple predicted sites for both. Here we examine the occupancy of the predicted O-glucose sites on mouse Notch1 (mN1) using the consensus sequence C1XSXPC2. We show that all of the predicted sites are modified, although the efficiency of modifying O-glucose sites is site- and cell type-dependent. For instance, although most sites are modified at high stoichiometries, the site at EGF 27 is only partially glucosylated, and the occupancy of the site at EGF 4 varies with cell type. O-Glucose is also found at a novel, non-traditional consensus site at EGF 9. Based on this finding, we propose a revision of the consensus sequence for O-glucosylation to allow alanine N-terminal to cysteine 2: C1XSX(A/P)C2. We also show through biochemical and mass spectral analyses that serine is the only hydroxyamino acid that is modified with O-glucose on EGF repeats. The O-glucose at all sites is efficiently elongated to the trisaccharide Xyl-Xyl-Glc. To establish the functional importance of individual O-glucose sites in mN1, we used a cell-based signaling assay. Elimination of most individual sites shows little or no effect on mN1 activation, suggesting that the major effects of O-glucose are mediated by modification of multiple sites. Interestingly, elimination of the site in EGF 28, found in the Abruptex region of Notch, does significantly reduce activity. These results demonstrate that, like O-fucose, the O-glucose modifications of EGF repeats occur extensively on mN1, and they play important roles in Notch function.

The Fringe elongation of O-fucose results in a change in the ligand-dependent activation of Notch signaling and subsequently in regulation of Notch in some developmental contexts (35Panin V.M.

The studies on O-fucose and Fringe form a paradigm for the role of glycosylation in Notch signaling. The O-glucose modifications of EGF repeats have received much less attention to date. O-Glucose was first discovered on bovine blood clotting factors VII and IX (42Hase S. Kawabata S. Nishimura H. Takeya H. Sueyoshi T. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Ikenaka T. J.

Comparison of the sites of modification on these five proteins led to a proposed consensus sequence, C1XSXPC2, between the first and the second conserved cysteine residues of an EGF repeat (47Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To date, only serine residues have been found to be modified with O-glucose, but it is unknown whether threonine can be modified. This consensus site can be found in EGF repeats of numerous secreted and membrane-bound proteins (supplemental Table 1) (48Shao L. Luo Y. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 49Fernandez-Valdivia R. Takeuchi H. Samarghandi A. Lopez M. Leonardi J. Haltiwanger R.S. Jafar-Nejad H.

Endogenous Notch1 isolated from CHO cells is known to be modified with O-glucose trisaccharide (16Moloney D.J. Shair L.H. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol.

A recent report confirmed that the O-glucose trisaccharide on Notch has the same structure as that reported above: Xyl-α1,3-Xyl-α1,3-Glc (50Whitworth G.E. Zandberg W.F. Clark T. Vocadlo D.J. Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). An enzymatic activity capable of adding O-glucose to EGF repeats, protein O-glucosyltransferase (Poglut), was detected and initially characterized in extracts of cell lines and various rat tissues (48Shao L. Luo Y. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The gene encoding Poglut, Rumi, was subsequently identified during a mutant screen in Drosophila for modifiers of Notch activity (51Acar M. Jafar-Nejad H. Takeuchi H. Rajan A. Ibrani D. Rana N.A.

Loss of Rumi results in a temperature-sensitive Notch loss-of-function phenotype in flies. Recent work shows that elimination of mouse Rumi also results in Notch-like phenotypes in mice (49Fernandez-Valdivia R. Takeuchi H. Samarghandi A. Lopez M. Leonardi J. Haltiwanger R.S. Jafar-Nejad H.

In addition, genes encoding the O-glucose-α1,3-xylosyltransferase have recently been identified (two distinct genes encode enzymes with this activity: GXYLT1 and GXYLT2) (52Sethi M.K. Buettner F.F.

The gene encoding the xyloside-α1,3-xylosyltransferase has not yet been identified. Here we address the question of which predicted O-glucose sites on mN1 are modified and to what extent they are elongated with the xyloses. We also examine the functional importance of individual sites by introducing single amino acid mutations and analyzing the effects in cell-based Notch signaling assays. The Lec1-CHO cell line was developed by Dr. Pamela Stanley (53Stanley P. Siminovitch L. Somatic Cell Genet. 1977; 3: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). COS7 and Lec1-CHO cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). COS7, NIH3T3, and HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Lec1-CHO cells were grown in α-minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. [6-3H]galactose (60 Ci/mmol) and UDP-[6-3H]glucose were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). All other reagents were of the highest quality available. Preparation of plasmids encoding the EGF repeats 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–18, 19–23, 24–28, 29–36, and 1–18 from mN1 with C-terminal Myc-His6 tags (in pSecTag2; Invitrogen) was described previously (17Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Lec1-CHO cells stably expressing each of these constructs were generated by treatment of transfected cells with 680 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen) for several weeks. Clones producing significant amounts of protein were isolated by dilution cloning and evaluated by immunoblot of media using anti-Myc antibody. Metabolic radiolabeling and purification of Notch fragments were performed essentially as described elsewhere (17Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), but the cells were labeled with 20 μCi/ml [6-3H]galactose. Alkali-induced β-eliminations and size fractionation of O-linked sugars on the Superdex column (Amersham Biosciences) were performed as described before (54Moloney D.J. Lin A.I. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19046-19050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Analysis of peaks for the presence of glucitol following acid hydrolysis was performed by high pH anion-exchange chromatograph with pulsed amperometric detection analysis as described (16Moloney D.J.

Fragments of the mN1 ECD consisting of EGF repeats 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–18, 19–23, 24–28, and 29–36 and 1–18 (as described above) were produced in stably transfected Lec1-CHO cells and purified using nickel-NTA chromatography as described previously (17Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Some Notch1 fragments were also produced in HEK293T, COS7, and NIH3T3 cells by transient transfection for comparison. The purified fragments were reduced using Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (Pierce) and carbamidomethylated with iodoacetamide prior to in-gel digestion, as described (51Acar M. Jafar-Nejad H. Takeuchi H. Rajan A. Ibrani D. Rana N.A. Pan H. Haltiwanger R.S. Bellen H.J. Cell. 2008; 132: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). For in-gel digests, ∼200–500 ng of protein was analyzed per run. The bands of interest were identified using zinc sulfate negative staining (Bio-Rad), excised, and digested with a protease (trypsin, chymotrypsin, V8) which, according to in silico digests (using the PeptideMass proteomics tool from the ExPASy Web site) yielded fragments of appropriate size for analysis in the ion trap in the m/z range 400–2200. The digestions were performed for 8–16 h at 37 °C in 20 mm diammonium phosphate, pH 8.0. For in-solution digests, ∼500 ng of protein was analyzed per run. Samples were reduced using 8 m urea, 0.4 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, and 10 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride and carbamidomethylated with 100 mm iodoacetamide. Reduced and alkylated samples were diluted four-fold with water and digested with trypsin or V8 for 8–16 h at 37 °C. Chymotryptic digests (Princeton Separations) were incubated for 8 h at 30 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl and 2 mm CaCl2. All digests were desalted on a C18 ZipTip microcolumn (Millipore), dried, and resuspended in 20% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. Samples were then subjected to capillary LC-MS/MS or nano-LC-MS/MS using CID, leading to losses of labile modifications, such as O-glycans, first, followed by fragmentation of the more stabile peptide backbone into b- and y-ions. For capillary LC-MS/MS, digests were fractionated by reverse phase liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using a Zorbax C8 capillary column (0.3 × 150 mm) (Agilent Technologies) with a 60-min linear gradient from 0 to 95% buffer B (buffer A: 0.1% formic acid; buffer B: 95% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid) at 5 μl/ml. The column effluent was sprayed into an XCT ion trap mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a capillary electrospray source, operating in the positive ion mode, and set up to perform MS/MS on either the two or three most intense ions in each spectrum. Samples were also analyzed by nano-LC-MS/MS using an Agilent 6340 ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an HPLC Chip-Cube interface. Sample volumes of 1.0–4.0 μl were injected onto a Zorbax 300SB-C18 chip with a 40-nl enrichment column and a 43 mm × 75 μm separation column (Agilent). Samples were initially loaded onto the enrichment column at 4.0 μl/min in 5.0% buffer B and then fractionated on the separation column at 450 nl/min with a 26-min non-linear gradient from 5.0 to 95% buffer B (buffer A: 0.1% formic acid; buffer B: 95% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid). The effluent from the HPLC-Chip was sprayed directly into the ion trap (Agilent), operating in the positive ion mode, and set up to perform MS/MS on the three most abundant ions in each scan, with 30-s active exclusion triggered after two consecutive spectra of a recurrent ion. All MS/MS experiments were carried out using the following settings: capillary voltage, 1700–1950 V; end plate Offset, −500 V; dry gas, 5.0 liters/min at 325 °C; trap drive, 100; smart target, 500,000; maximum accumulation time, 150 ms; and scan range, 300–2200 m/z. Spectra were confirmed by searching databases with the MS/MS data using the Global Proteome Machine search engine (available on the World Wide Web). All cysteines were carbamidomethylated, and masses of all peptides were adjusted accordingly. The O-glucose-modified peptides were identified by searching the MS/MS data for constant neutral losses of masses equivalent to the O-glucose mono-, di-, and trisaccharides (162, 294, and 426 Da, respectively) relative to parent ions using the Data Analysis Tool (Agilent) as described (55Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 417: 93-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). O-Fucose-modified peptides were identified by constant neutral loss searches of 146 Da, and O-HexNAc modified peptides by constant neutral loss searches of 203 Da. Subsequent searches of the MS/MS data were performed to identify peptides modified with mono- or disaccharide forms of O-glucose by generating extracted ion chromatograms using the masses of the unglycosylated peptide for the search. Relative levels of the predicted glycoforms for each glycopeptide were analyzed using extracted ion chromatograms (EIC) for the appropriate parent ions. Glycosylation of peptides frequently suppresses ionization, so these analyses may underestimate the ratio of glycosylated peptide to naked peptide. Nonetheless, previous analysis of several O-glucosylated peptides prepared from Drosophila Notch expressed in control or Rumi-knockdown S2 cells showed that the decrease in intensity of O-glucosylated peptide corresponded quite well to the increase in naked peptide (51Acar M. Jafar-Nejad H. Takeuchi H. Rajan A. Ibrani D. Rana N.A. Pan H. Haltiwanger R.S. Bellen H.J. Cell. 2008; 132: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thus, in our experience, O-glucosylation does not cause significant suppression of ionization. ETD transfers electrons from an anionic reagent (fluoranthene) to protonated peptides, causing fragmentation into c- and z-ions. This lower energy fragmentation method leaves the labile O-glycan modification attached to its hydroxy amino acid, thereby retaining positional sequence information of the modification within a given peptide. Samples were characterized by nano-LC-MS/MS using an Agilent 6340 ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with ETD for peptide sequence analysis by MS/MS with glycans remaining intact. Parameters were as follows: reactant temperature, 60 °C; ionization energy, 80 eV; emission current, 2 μA; ionization chamber, −3.7 V, with an accumulation time of 25–35 ms and trap drive of 25. The site-directed mutagenesis of all O-glucose sites in mN1 was performed using as a template a full-length construct of mN1 in which the C-terminal PEST domain was replaced with six tandem Myc epitopes (Notch1-Myc6) in the vector pCS2+ (a generous gift from Dr. Raphael Kopan, Washington University School of Medicine). All glycosylation sites (serine residues) were mutated to alanine using PCR-based mutagenesis, and the mutated constructs were sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutation (see supplemental Table 2 for a list of primers used). For EGF 28, the Ala residue was reverted to Ser to demonstrate that the aberrant signaling was not due to any other inadvertently introduced mutation in Notch. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. This assay was adapted from our previously described co-culture assay for NIH3T3 cells (25Rampal R. Arboleda-Velasquez J.F. Nita-Lazar A. Kosik K.S.

Previously, we identified two hypersensitive induced reaction (AtHIR) proteins, AtHIR1 (At1g09840) and AtHIR2 (At3g01290), as potential RPS2 complex components. AtHIR proteins contain the stomatin/prohibitin/flotillin/HflK/C domain (also known as the prohibitin domain or band 7 domain). In this study, we confirmed that AtHIR1 and AtHIR2 form complexes with RPS2 in Arabidopsis and Nicotiana benthamiana using a pulldown assay and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis. Arabidopsis has four HIR family genes (AtHIR1–4). All AtHIR proteins could form homo- and hetero-oligomers in vivo and were enriched in membrane microdomains of the plasma membrane. The mRNA levels of all except AtHIR4 were significantly induced by microbe-associated molecular patterns, such as the bacterial flagellin fragment flg22. Athir2-1 and Athir3-1 mutants allowed more growth of Pto DC3000 AvrRpt2, but not Pto DC3000, indicating that these mutations reduce RPS2-mediated ETI but do not affect basal resistance to the virulent strain. Overexpression of AtHIR1 and AtHIR2 reduced growth of Pto DC3000.

https://openalex.org/W2015225625,"Menin is a tumor suppressor protein that is encoded by the MEN1 (multiple endocrine neoplasia 1) gene and controls cell growth in endocrine tissues. Importantly, menin also serves as a critical oncogenic cofactor of MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) fusion proteins in acute leukemias. Direct association of menin with MLL fusion proteins is required for MLL fusion protein-mediated leukemogenesis in vivo, and this interaction has been validated as a new potential therapeutic target for development of novel anti-leukemia agents. Here, we report the first crystal structure of menin homolog from Nematostella vectensis. Due to a very high sequence similarity, the Nematostella menin is a close homolog of human menin, and these two proteins likely have very similar structures. Menin is predominantly an α-helical protein with the protein core comprising three tetratricopeptide motifs that are flanked by two α-helical bundles and covered by a β-sheet motif. A very interesting feature of menin structure is the presence of a large central cavity that is highly conserved between Nematostella and human menin. By employing site-directed mutagenesis, we have demonstrated that this cavity constitutes the binding site for MLL. Our data provide a structural basis for understanding the role of menin as a tumor suppressor protein and as an oncogenic co-factor of MLL fusion proteins. It also provides essential structural information for development of inhibitors targeting the menin-MLL interaction as a novel therapeutic strategy in MLL-related leukemias."

Here, we show that ABCA1 regulation and activity are also impaired in cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD), caused by mutations in the LIPA gene that result in less than 5% of normal lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) activity. Fibroblasts from patients with CESD showed impaired up-regulation of ABCA1 in response to low density lipoprotein (LDL) loading, reduced phospholipid and cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I, and reduced α-HDL particle formation. Treatment of normal fibroblasts with chloroquine to inhibit LAL activity reduced ABCA1 expression and activity, similar to that of CESD cells. Liver X receptor agonist treatment of CESD cells corrected ABCA1 expression but failed to correct LDL cholesteryl ester hydrolysis and cholesterol efflux to apoA-I. LDL-induced production of 27-hydroxycholesterol was reduced in CESD compared with normal fibroblasts. Treatment with conditioned medium containing LAL from normal fibroblasts or with recombinant human LAL rescued ABCA1 expression, apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux, HDL particle formation, and production of 27-hydroxycholesterol by CESD cells. These results provide further evidence that the rate of release of cholesterol from late endosomes/lysosomes is a critical regulator of ABCA1 expression and activity, and an explanation for the hypoalphalipoproteinemia seen in CESD patients.

https://openalex.org/W2139870319,"Sex determination in fetal germ cells depends on a balance between exposure to retinoic acid (RA) and the degradation of RA achieved by the testis-specific expression of the catabolic cytochrome P450 enzyme, CYP26B1. Therefore, identification of factors regulating the expression of the Cyp26b1 gene is an important goal in reproductive biology. We used in situ hybridization to demonstrate that Cyp26b1 and transcription factor genes steroidogenic factor-1 (Sf1) and Sry-related HMG box 9 (Sox9) are coexpressed in Sertoli cells, whereas Cyp26b1 and Sf1 are coexpressed in Leydig cells in mouse fetal testes. In the mouse gonadal somatic cell line TM3, transfection of constructs expressing SOX9 and SF1 activated Cyp26b1 expression, independently of the positive regulator RA. In embryonic gonads deficient in SOX9 or SF1, Cyp26b1 expression was decreased relative to wild-type (WT) controls, as measured by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, qRT-PCR showed that Cyp26b1 up-regulation by SOX9/SF1 was attenuated by the ovarian transcription factor Forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) in TM3 cells, whereas in Foxl2-null mice, Cyp26b1 expression in XX gonads was increased ~20-fold relative to WT controls. These data support the hypothesis that SOX9 and SF1 ensure the male fate of germ cells by up-regulating Cyp26b1 and that FOXL2 acts to antagonize Cyp26b1 expression in ovaries.—Kashimada, K., Svingen, T., Feng, C.-W., Pelosi, E., Bagheri-Fam, S., Harley, V.

https://openalex.org/W2034714666,"Ordered nucleosome disassembly and reassembly are required for eukaryotic DNA replication. The facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) complex, a histone chaperone comprising Spt16 and SSRP1, is involved in DNA replication as well as transcription. FACT associates with the MCM helicase, which is involved in DNA replication initiation and elongation. Although the FACT-MCM complex is reported to regulate DNA replication initiation, its functional role in DNA replication elongation remains elusive. To elucidate the functional role of FACT in replication fork progression during DNA elongation in the cells, we generated and analyzed conditional SSRP1 gene knock-out chicken (Gallus gallus) DT40 cells. SSRP1-depleted cells ceased to grow and exhibited a delay in S-phase cell cycle progression, although SSRP1 depletion did not affect the level of chromatin-bound DNA polymerase α or nucleosome reassembly on daughter strands. The tracking length of newly synthesized DNA, but not origin firing, was reduced in SSRP1-depleted cells, suggesting that the S-phase cell cycle delay is mainly due to the inhibition of replication fork progression rather than to defects in the initiation of DNA replication in these cells. We discuss the mechanisms of how FACT promotes replication fork progression in the cells. Ordered nucleosome disassembly and reassembly are required for eukaryotic DNA replication. The facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) complex, a histone chaperone comprising Spt16 and SSRP1, is involved in DNA replication as well as transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2001231425,"‘Animal personality’ means that individuals differ from one another in either single behaviours or suites of related behaviours in a way that is consistent over time. It is usually assumed that such consistent individual differences in behaviour are driven by variation in how individuals respond to information about their environment, rather than by differences in external factors such as variation in microhabitat. Since behavioural variation is ubiquitous in nature we might expect ‘animal personality’ to be present in diverse taxa, including animals with relatively simple nervous systems. We investigated in situ startle responses in a sea anemone, Actinia equina, to determine whether personalities might be present in this example of an animal with a simple nervous system. We found very high levels of repeatability among individuals that were re-identified in the same locations over a three week sampling period. In a subset of the data, where we used tide-pool temperature measurements to control for a key element of variation in microhabitat, these high levels of repeatability remained. Although a range of other consistent differences in micro-habitat features could have contributed to consistent differences between the behaviour of individuals, these data suggest the presence of animal personality in A. equina. Rather than being restricted to certain groups, personality may be a general feature of animals and may be particularly pronounced in species with simple nervous systems."
https://openalex.org/W2104250120,"Leptospira interrogans is the etiological agent of leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease of human and veterinary concern. The identification of novel proteins that mediate host-pathogen interactions is important for understanding the bacterial pathogenesis as well as to identify protective antigens that would help fight the disease. We describe in this work the cloning, expression, purification and characterization of three predicted leptospiral membrane proteins, LIC10258, LIC12880 (Lp30) and LIC12238. We have employed Escherichia coli BL21 (SI) strain as a host expression system. Recently, we have identified LIC12238 as a plasminogen (PLG)-binding receptor. We show now that Lp30 and rLIC10258 are also PLG-receptors of Leptospira, both exhibiting dose-dependent and saturating binding (K(D), 68.8±25.2 nM and 167.39±60.1 nM, for rLIC10258 and rLIC12880, respectively). In addition, LIC10258, which is a novel OmpA-like protein, binds laminin and plasma fibronectin ECM molecules and hence, it was named Lsa66 (Leptospiral surface adhesin of 66 kDa). Binding of Lsa66 to ECM components was determined to be specific, dose-dependent and saturable, with a K(D) of 55.4±15.9 nM to laminin and of 290.8±11.8 nM to plasma fibronectin. Binding of the recombinant proteins to PLG or ECM components was assessed by using antibodies against each of the recombinant proteins obtained in mice and confirmed by monoclonal anti-polyhistidine antibodies. Lsa66 caused partial inhibition on leptospiral adherence to immobilized ECM and PLG. Moreover, this adhesin and rLIC12238 are recognized by antibodies in serum samples of confirmed leptospirosis cases. Thus, Lsa66 is a novel OmpA-like protein with dual activity that may promote the attachment of Leptospira to host tissues and may contribute to the leptospiral invasion. To our knowledge, this is the first leptospiral protein with ECM and PLG binding properties reported to date."
https://openalex.org/W1595972325,"One of the main forms of nitrogen assimilated by microorganisms and plants is ammonium, despite its toxicity at low millimolar concentrations. Ammonium absorption has been demonstrated to be carried out by highly selective plasma membrane-located transporters of the AMT/MEP/Rh family and characterized by the presence of a well conserved hydrophobic pore through which ammonia is proposed to move. However, uncertainties exist regarding the exact chemical species transported by these membrane proteins, which can be in the form of either hydrophobic ammonia or charged ammonium. Here, we present the characterization of PvAMT1;1 from the common bean and demonstrate that it mediates the high affinity (micromolar), rapidly saturating (1 mM) electrogenic transport of ammonium. Activity of the transporter is enhanced by low extracellular pH, and associated with this acidic pH stimulation are changes in the reversal potential and cytoplasm acidification, indicating that PvAMT1;1 functions as an H(+)/NH(4)(+) symporter. Mutation analysis of a unique histidine present in PvAMT1;1 (H125R) leads to the stimulation of ammonium transport by decreasing the K(m) value by half and by increasing the V(max) 3-fold, without affecting the pH dependence of the symporter. In contrast, mutation of the first conserved histidine within the channel modifies the properties of PvAMT1;1, increasing its K(m) and V(max) values and transforming it into a pH-independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2122647275,"Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is well documented to possess general cytoprotective properties in protecting the cell against stressful and noxious stimuli. We have recently shown that expression of the stress-inducible Hsp70.3 gene in the myocardium in response to ischemic preconditioning is NF-κB-dependent and necessary for the resulting late phase cardioprotection against a subsequent ischemia/reperfusion injury. Here we show that the Hsp70.3 gene product is subject to post-transcriptional regulation through parallel regulatory processes involving microRNAs and alternative polyadenylation of the mRNA transcript. First, we show that cardiac ischemic preconditioning of the in vivo mouse heart results in decreased levels of two Hsp70.3-targeting microRNAs: miR-378* and miR-711. Furthermore, an ischemic or heat shock stimulus induces alternative polyadenylation of the expressed Hsp70.3 transcript that results in the accumulation of transcripts with a shortened 3′-UTR. This shortening of the 3′-UTR results in the loss of the binding site for the suppressive miR-378* and thus renders the alternatively polyadenylated transcript insusceptible to miR-378*-mediated suppression. Results also suggest that the alternative polyadenylation-mediated shortening of the Hsp70.3 3′-UTR relieves translational suppression observed in the long 3′-UTR variant, allowing for a more robust increase in protein expression. These results demonstrate alternative polyadenylation of Hsp70.3 in parallel with ischemic or heat shock-induced up-regulation of mRNA levels and implicate the importance of this process in post-transcriptional control of Hsp70.3 expression.

Lamb A.L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 11930-11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As a microbial N-hydroxylating monooxygenase, PvdA is considered to be a member of the class B flavoprotein monooxygenases, which share the following characteristics. 1) FAD is a stably bound cofactor; 2) NADPH, but not NADH, serves as the electron-donating co-substrate and remains bound during the oxidative half-reaction; 3) they are composed of FAD and NADPH dinucleotide-binding domains; and 4) they are encoded by a single gene (2van Berkel W.J.. Kamerbeek N.M. Fraaije M.W. J. Biotechnol. 2006; 124: 670-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). PvdA meets these requirements with some caveats: PvdA does not stably bind FAD (1Meneely K.M. Lamb A.L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 11930-11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and no previous work documents structure or confirms NADP+ binding through the oxidative half-reaction.

In short, NADPH reduces the oxidized flavin in the reductive half-reaction. In the oxidative half-reaction, ornithine binding accelerates the addition of oxygen to the flavin and makes a short-lived peroxyflavin intermediate (which is slow to form and long-lived in the absence of ornithine), followed by the hydroperoxyflavin intermediate. The hydroperoxyflavin donates the distal oxygen atom to the ornithine, forming hydroxyornithine and the hydroxyflavin intermediate. The hydroxyflavin intermediate dehydrates to regenerate the oxidized flavin. The oxidized nicotinamide cofactor dissociates with the product such that the cycle can continue. Class B Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases include cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO) 2The abbreviations used are: CHMOcyclohexanone monooxygenaseFMOflavin-containing monooxygenasebFMObacterial FMOSeMetselenomethioniner.m.s.d.root mean square deviation. from Acinetobacter sp., which catalyzes the insertion of oxygen in the cyclohexanone ring to form a lactone via a Criegee intermediate (Fig. 1b) (9Sheng D.

For CHMO, the reactive flavin intermediate is the peroxyflavin, and no hydroperoxyflavin intermediate is formed in the product-forming cycle. The bacterial flavin monooxygenase from Methylophaga aminisulfidivorans belongs to the final subclass: the flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs). This subclass comprises both eukaryotic and prokaryotic monooxygenases that are able to catalyze hydroxylation of the reactive heteroatoms nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, selenium, and iodine (2van Berkel W.J..

Here, we present two structures of the ornithine hydroxylase from P. aeruginosa, which are the first structures of a member of the microbial N-hydroxylating flavoprotein monooxygenase subclass. The enzyme structures are each mechanistically relevant ternary complexes, one in the oxidized state and one in the reduced state. These structures are compared with those determined previously for CHMO from Rhodococcus sp HI-31 (11Mirza I.A. Yachnin B.J. Wang S. Grosse S. Bergeron H. Imura A. Iwaki H. Hasegawa Y. Lau P.C.

We provide evidence that NADP+ remains bound throughout the oxidative half-reaction for PvdA. Finally, we postulate that the two structures represent the reduced structure poised for oxygen binding and catalysis and the oxidized structure prior to product release. PvdA was cloned, overexpressed, and purified as described previously (1Meneely K.M. Lamb A.L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 11930-11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The method for overexpression of SeMet PvdA was adapted from the protocol of Van Duyne et al. (13Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar) with several modifications. M9 minimal medium was inoculated with 10 ml of overnight culture/liter of medium. The methionine biosynthesis pathway was inhibited by the addition of 100 mg each of l-lysine, l-phenylalanine, and l-threonine; 50 mg each of l-isoleucine, l-leucine, and l-valine; and 60 mg of dl-selenomethionine per liter of culture. Fifteen minutes after the addition of the amino acid mixture, protein expression was induced with the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 400 μm. SeMet PvdA was purified using the same protocol as that used for oxidized PvdA with the addition of 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol to all buffers. Oxidized PvdA crystals were obtained through the hanging drop vapor diffusion method with a well solution containing 9.5% (w/v) PEG 8000, 25% (v/v) glycerol, and 60 mm monobasic potassium phosphate (pH 5.0). A solution of 16 mg/ml PvdA was incubated with FAD, NADPH, and l-ornithine to a final molar ratio of 1:3:20:150 (protein/FAD/NADPH/l-ornithine) on ice for 30 min. Three-microliter drops with a 1:1 ratio of protein to well solution were prepared over 600 μl of well solution. Rod-shaped yellow crystals grew to a size of 200 × 50 × 50 μm in 3 days at 18 °C. Crystals of SeMet PvdA were obtained under similar conditions to those described for oxidized PvdA (8% (w/v) PEG 8000, 15% (v/v) glycerol, and 80 mm MES (pH 5.5)). To keep a reduced environment, 10 μl of 1 m β-mercaptoethanol was added to each well. The protein solution was prepared with FAD, NADPH, and ornithine at the same ratios as used for oxidized PvdA. SeMet PvdA crystals grew to a size of 150 × 40 × 40 μm in 5 days at 18 °C at a protein concentration of 9 mg/ml in 2-μl drops. A flake of sodium dithionite was added to a drop containing oxidized PvdA crystals. The drop and crystals were monitored for a change from yellow to colorless for 30 min. Oxidized PvdA crystals were harvested and transferred to a mother liquor drop with 11% (w/v) PEG 8000, 60 mm monobasic potassium phosphate, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 21 mm FAD, 41 mm NADPH, and 166 mm l-ornithine. SeMet PvdA crystals were harvested and transferred to a cryoprotectant with the same composition as used for the oxidized PvdA cryoprotectant with the addition of 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Reduced PvdA crystals were harvested and transferred to a cryoprotectant with the same composition as used for the oxidized PvdA cryoprotectant with the addition of sodium dithionite as described above. All crystals were flash-cooled to 77 K by plunging in liquid nitrogen. Multiwavelength anomalous dispersion experimental data for the SeMet PvdA crystal were collected at beamline 9-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource. Peak (0.979112 Å), inflection (0.979304 Å), and remote (0.918402 Å) wavelengths were determined by a selenium fluorescence scan (K-edge, 12.6578 keV).

The following residues are disordered in the structure: chain A, residues 1–9, 199–205, 360, and 428–443; and chain B, residues 1–9, 200–206, and 420–443. Both monomers have FAD, NADP+, and hydroxyornithine in the active site. The NADP+ nicotinamide moiety and ribose in the chain A active site are not modeled due to poor electron density, nor is the nicotinamide moiety in chain B. The model includes 376 waters and 4 phosphate molecules. Ramachandran analysis as calculated by PROCHECK (19Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showed good geometry and angles, with 90.8% of the residues in allowed regions and 9.2% in additionally allowed regions. The reduced PvdA model contains two monomers per asymmetric unit. Both chains A and B have poor or no electron density for residues 1–8, 200–207, and 428–443. In addition, residues 359 and 360 are disordered in chain B. Both chains contain FADH2, ornithine, and NADPH in the active site. In contrast to the oxidized model, the NADPH nicotinamide moiety is modeled in both active sites. Although density for ornithine was present in the reduced active site, it was not as well defined as the density of the hydroxyornithine in the oxidized structure. All root mean square deviations were calculated using LSQMAN of the DEJAVU program suite (20Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 525-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Protein structure figures were generated using PyMOL (21DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar), and topology diagrams were generated using TopDraw (22Bond C.S. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The standard assay buffer contained 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 0.01 mm FAD, and 0–0.15 mm NADPH, with NADP+ concentrations ranging from 0 to 2 mm. PvdA (1 μm) was incubated in 1 ml of assay buffer for 2 min at 25 °C before the reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 mm l-ornithine. The NADPH oxidation was monitored at 366 nm (ϵ = 2850 m−1 cm−1) using a Cary 50 Bio spectrophotometer (Varian) and an electrothermal single cell holder for temperature control (±0.1 °C) at 25 °C for 120 s with 2-s time points according to the protocol described previously (1Meneely K.M. Lamb A.L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 11930-11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). All experiments were conducted in triplicate with standard deviations as indicated. Initial phase estimates for PvdA were determined by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing using a selenomethionine-substituted form of the protein (Table 1). The SeMet model was used as a starting point for structure refinement of the oxidized protein using a 1.9 Å isomorphous data set. The asymmetric unit contains two monomers of PvdA, related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis. The interface between the monomers buries ∼950 Å2 as calculated by PROTORP (23Reynolds C. Damerell D. Jones S. Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 413-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), which is in the range for homodimer formation (24Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar); however, the biological assembly is assumed to be the monomer because dynamic light scattering observations provide a hydrodynamic radius indicative of a monomer in solution (1Meneely K.M. Lamb A.L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 11930-11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Each monomer of PvdA comprises three well defined domains linked by flexible loops (Fig. 2). The FAD-binding domain is the largest of the three domains (250 residues) and is folded into an α/β-nucleotide-binding architecture. This domain is composed of residues from three separate segments belonging to the N and C termini: residues 1–171, 356–396, and 405–443. The NADPH-binding domain is composed of 144 residues, and also folds into an α/β-nucleotide-binding fold. This domain includes residues 170–245 and 285–355. The smallest domain is the ornithine-binding domain, comprising 45 residues (248–285 and 398–404) that form four small helices. A protein structural comparison using the service Fold at the European Bioinformatics Institute (25Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3166) Google Scholar) suggested that PvdA shared approximately similar structural homology with a wide range of flavin-dependent enzymes, with none significantly more similar than the class B monooxygenases. Least-squares superpositioning of bFMO (the most similar from this subclass) and PvdA using LSQMAN (20Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 525-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) indicated a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 1.8 Å over 213 aligned Cα atoms of the possible 414 modeled α-carbons in the PvdA structure, with the predominance of the structural similarity in the FAD-binding domain (r.m.s.d. of 1.6 Å for 163 Cα atoms) and some similarity in the NADPH-binding domain (r.m.s.d. of 2.0 Å for 58 Cα atoms). A structural alignment between closed CHMO (the most similar from the Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase subclass) and PvdA provided a r.m.s.d. of 1.8 Å over 263 Cα atoms aligned. The structural similarity was highest in the FAD-binding domain (r.m.s.d. of 1.7 Å for 157 Cα atoms) and NADPH-binding domain (r.m.s.d. of 2.0 Å for 93 Cα atoms), with some structural similarity in the substrate-binding domains (r.m.s.d. of 2.2 Å for 13 Cα atoms). A side-by-side comparison of PvdA with FMO and CHMO, as well as a topology comparison, is shown in Fig. 3. It is immediately evident that PvdA is a smaller protein. Whereas the topologies of the individual FAD- and NADPH-binding domains share similarities expected for Rossmann-like domains, they are distinct among the three proteins. Furthermore, FMO does not possess a substrate-binding domain, as found in both PvdA and CHMO. The FAD molecule is in an elongated conformation with the isoalloxazine-flavin ring structure at the interface of all three domains. The architecture of the FAD-binding domain is an α/β-fold characteristic of the glutathione reductase structural family of flavoproteins (26Dym O. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1712-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In PvdA, this domain comprises two β-sheets and five helices. The central sheet contains five parallel strands that are flanked on one side by a three-stranded antiparallel sheet and on the other by the helices (Fig. 3). The nucleotide-binding consensus sequence (GXGXXG) is located in a conserved dinucleotide-binding βαβ-motif, which in flavin-binding domains forms a dipole-charge interaction between the N terminus of the helix and the diphosphate moiety of FAD. However, the loop between strand A and helix 1 in PvdA is not the characteristic tight turn (GXGXXG) but has three amino acids (GXGXXG). Furthermore, the sequence is not completely conserved in PvdA, with the final residue being an asparagine (GXGXXN). This asparagine (Asn-22 of helix 1) forms a hydrogen bond from the side chain nitrogen to the backbone carbonyl of Gly-17 (the first glycine of the consensus sequence). The side chain oxygen of Asn-22 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain nitrogen of Gln-395 of strand P. This hydrogen bond network may serve to stabilize the longer loop between strand A and helix 1. Finally, unlike the other class B monooxygenases, the FAD cofactor is not as buried in the dinucleotide-binding cleft (Fig. 4) but is solvent-exposed, most probably explaining why PvdA does not bind FAD tightly. The NADPH molecule is also bound in an elongated conformation at an analogous position to that of FAD in the α/β-nucleotide-binding architecture of the NADPH-binding domain. As with the FAD-binding domain, the NADPH-binding domain contains a central sheet of five parallel strands that are flanked on one side by a three-stranded antiparallel sheet and on the other by helices (Fig. 3). A five-residue turn (residues 214–218) that connects strand I with helix 6 forms the analogous interaction loop for nucleotide binding. There is not sufficient electron density to model nicotinamide in the A or B chain or the nicotinamide ribose in the A chain. This flexibility in binding of the co-substrate is suggestive of motion in the active site that is required for catalysis. Two interactions provide structural evidence for the specificity of NADPH over NADH for PvdA (1Meneely K.M. Lamb A.L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 11930-11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Arg-240 forms two hydrogen bonds with the phosphate of the adenine ribose, and the guanidinium forms a stacking interaction with the adenine moiety of the NADPH. An equivalent interaction is present in CHMO (Arg-210) and bFMO (Arg-234), which are both NADPH-specific. Ser-286 also hydrogen bonds with this phosphate, equivalent to Ser-210 in bFMO. The equivalent interaction in CHMO is hypothesized to be Lys-329, for which there is biochemical evidence for cofactor specificity (27Kamerbeek N.M. Fraaije M.W. Janssen D.B. FEBS Lett. 2004; 271: 2107-2116Google Scholar); however, although this lysine is proximal to the phosphate group, there are no direct interactions in either the open or closed CHMO structures (11Mirza I.A. Yachnin B.J. Wang S. Grosse S. Bergeron H. Imura A. Iwaki H. Hasegawa Y. Lau P.C. Berghuis A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 8848-8854Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The ornithine-binding domain is smallest of the three domains, composed of four helices forming a bundle. The helices are derived from the loop connecting strand P and helix 12 of the FAD-binding domain (helix 11) and from the loop connecting strand J and helix 10 of the NADPH-binding domain (helices 7–9). Whereas PvdA was incubated with FAD, NADPH, and ornithine prior to crystallization, there is clear density for the hydroxylated product, and this molecule has thus been modeled as hydroxyornithine. The hydroxyornithine lies in the cleft at the interface between the FAD- and ornithine-binding domain (Fig. 5, a and c). A network of hydrogen bonds and salt links includes five residues, two from the FAD-binding domain (Gln-64 and Lys-69) and three from the ornithine-binding domain (Asn-254, Thr-283, and Asn-284), that with two waters stabilize hydroxyornithine in the active site 5.5 Å away from the C4a atom of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD (Fig. 5c). Three of the stabilizing residues, Gln-64, Lys-69, and Asn-254, are located in flexible loops, whereas Asn-254 is located in helix 7 and Thr-283 in helix 9. Gln-64 forms a hydrogen bond with the newly formed hydroxyl group on the hydroxyornithine side chain. Asn-254 forms hydrogen bonds with both the carboxylate and amine of the ornithine main chain, and Lys-69 forms a salt bridge with the carboxylate, providing a clear basis for the exclusive l-amino acid specificity observed for this enzyme (1Meneely K.M. Lamb A.L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 11930-11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). There are no large structural differences between the oxidized and reduced structures of PvdA. Indeed, superimposing the two structures in LSQMAN results in a r.m.s.d. of 0.4 Å for all Cα atoms (supplemental Fig. S1). The most significant differences between the two models lie in the active site itself (Fig. 5, b and d). Whereas there is no electron density for the nicotinamide moiety in the oxidized PvdA structure, the nicotinamide moiety has well defined electron density (for an ∼3 Å structure) in both monomers of the reduced structure. The second significant difference between the two active sites is the poor electron density of the substrate in the reduced structure compared with the very well defined electron density of the product in the oxidized model. (There is no electron density for the hydroxyl group of the product, and this molecule is thus modeled as the ornithine substrate in the reduced structure.) This would suggest lower occupancy for ornithine binding in the active site when FAD is reduced. Two amino acid side chains have altered their conformations between the oxidized and reduced structures. Gln-64 is slightly rotated away from the ordered nicot"
https://openalex.org/W2134137024,"Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a cholesterol carrier associated with atherosclerosis, is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) regulates ApoE levels in the periphery and in the central nervous system. LDLR has been identified on astrocytes and a number of studies show that it modulates amyloid deposition in AD transgenic mice. However these findings are controversial on whether LDLR deletion is beneficial or detrimental on the AD-like phenotype of the transgenic mice.To investigate the role of LDLR in the development of the amyloid related phenotype we used an APP/PS1 transgenic mouse (5XFAD) that develops an AD-like pathology with amyloid plaques, astrocytosis and microgliosis. We found that 4 months old 5XFAD transgenic mice on the LDLR deficient background (LDLR-/-) have increased amyloid plaque deposition. This increase is associated with a significant decrease in astrocytosis and microgliosis in the 5XFAD/LDLR-/- mice. To further elucidate the role of LDLR in relation with ApoE we have generated 5XFAD transgenic mice on the ApoE deficient (ApoE-/-) or the ApoE/LDLR double deficient background (ApoE-/-/LDLR -/-). We have found that ApoE deletion in the 4 months old 5XFAD/ApoE-/- mice decreases amyloid plaque formation as expected, but has no effect on astrocytosis or microgliosis. By comparison 5XFAD/ApoE-/-LDLR -/- double deficient mice of the same age have increased amyloid deposition with decreased astrocytosis and microgliosis.Our analysis shows that LDL deficiency regulates astrocytosis and microgliosis in an AD mouse model. This effect is independent of ApoE, as both 5XFAD/LDLR -/- and 5XFAD/ApoE-/- LDLR -/- mice show reduction in inflammatory response and increase in amyloid deposition compared to control mice. These results demonstrate that LDLR regulates glial response in this mouse model independently of ApoE and modifies amyloid deposition."

Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), the central regulator of cell growth, can be positively or negatively regulated by various stresses through different mechanisms. The p38 MAP kinase pathway is essential in cellular stress responses. Activation of MK2, a downstream kinase of p38α, enhances mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity by preventing TSC2 from inhibiting mTOR activation.

Here we show the activation of p38β participates in activation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) induced by arsenite but not insulin, nutrients, anisomycin, or H2O2. Arsenite treatment of cells activates p38β and induces interaction between p38β and Raptor, a regulatory component of mTORC1, resulting in phosphorylation of Raptor on Ser863 and Ser771. The phosphorylation of Raptor on these sites enhances mTORC1 activity, and contributes largely to arsenite-induced mTORC1 activation.

The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathway plays an important role in a variety of biological processes, including inflammation, cell differentiation, and cell death (1Ono K.

Although similarities in activation and function have been observed, each p38 isoform also has distinct functions (8Zarubin T. Han J. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). Although activation of p38 MAPKs by different stimuli is cell type-dependent, various stress stimuli appear to activate the p38 pathway in all types of cells, and thus the p38 pathway is considered to be a major stress-activated signaling pathway (9Rincón M. Davis R.J. Immunol. Rev. 2009; 228: 212-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The activation of transcription factors and subsequent gene expression is a major mechanism by which the p38 pathway mediates biological responses (10Dong C. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Annu. Rev.

Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). mTOR exists in two distinct functional complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2. mTORC1 is potently and specifically inhibited by rapamycin, and it regulates cell size, autophagy, ribosome biogenesis, protein translation, transcription, and cellular viability (15Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N.

The tumor suppressors TSC1 and TSC2 negatively regulate mTOR by acting as the GTPase-activating protein for the small GTPase Ras-homology enriched in brain (Rheb), and thus they decrease Rheb-GTP and prevent Rheb from stimulating mTOR activity (27Inoki K.

TSC1/TSC2 is essential for growth factor-, nutrient-, and energy-mediated regulation of mTORC1; however, recent studies have shown that other proteins can also play an essential role. The small G protein RAG can sense nutrients and directly mediate mTORC1 relocalization and activation (29Kim E. Goraksha-Hicks P. Li L. Neufeld T.P. Guan K.L. Nat.

Science. 2008; 320: 1496-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). mTOR can self-enhance its activity by phosphorylation of Raptor (regulatory associated protein of TOR), a component of the mTORC1 complex (31Wang L.

It was suggested that the mTOR-mediated Raptor phosphorylation is a biochemical rheostat that modulates mTORC1 activity in accordance with environmental cues (32Foster K.G. Acosta-Jaquez H.A.

Cross-talk between the p38 and mTOR pathways has been reported. Phosphorylation of serine 1210 on TSC2 by MK2, a downstream kinase of p38α, creates a 14-3-3 binding site, which has been implicated to play a role in inhibiting TSC2 and thus promote anisomycin-induced mTOR activation (33Li Y. Inoki K. Vacratsis P. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13663-13671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A recent paper suggested that p38α or p38β and Drosophila p38b promote mTOR activation under various conditions (34Cully M. Genevet A. Warne P. Treins C. Liu T. Bastien J. Baum B. Tapon N. Leevers S.J. Downward J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 30: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Our recent study shows that the p38β-PRAK (p38-regulated/activated protein kinase, or MK5) cascade selectively participates in glucose depletion-induced inactivation of mTORC1. PRAK directly phosphorylates Rheb on serine 130, which in turn impairs the GTP-binding ability of Rheb and prevents Rheb from stimulating mTOR activity (35Zheng M. Wang Y.H. Wu X.N. Wu S.Q. Lu B.J. Dong M.Q. Zhang H. Sun P. Lin S.C. Guan K.L. Han J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is clear that there are multiple different interplays between the p38 pathway and mTOR pathway. Although energy stress leads to inactivation of mTORC1, other cell stresses can either inhibit or activate mTORC1 (14Sengupta S. Peterson T.R. Sabatini D.M. Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 310-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Arsenite is a contaminant toxicant and is also used as a medicinal compound. It activates mTORC1, but the mechanism of this activation is unknown. Here we report that p38β selectively participates in arsenite-induced mTORC1 activation, but not in other stress-induced activation of mTOR. Arsenite-induced activation of mTOR is independent from AMPK and TSC2, and occurs at least partially via direct phosphorylation of Raptor by p38β to activate mTORC1. Sodium arsenite, rapamycin, insulin, and anisomycin were obtained from Sigma. PD98059 and SB203580 were obtained from Calbiochem. Immobilon-P PVDF membrane and Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate were obtained from Millipore. Autoradiography film was obtained from Kodak. p38αlox/lox, p38βlox/lox, p38γlox/lox, and p38δlox/lox primary MEFs were prepared from E13.5 embryos of respective mice with a locus flanked by LoxP sites and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) and 10 units/ml of penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were validated by genomic PCR and then immortalized by SV40 large T antigen. To generate gene knock-out MEF cells, the p38αlox/lox, p38βlox/lox, p38γlox/lox, and p38δlox/lox MEF cells were infected with Cre to excise the loxed gene. The gene knock-out was confirmed by genomic PCR. Expression constructs of MKK6b(E), mTOR(KD), murine p38α, human p38β, human p38γ, and human p38δ were described previously (7Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z.

Benoit Viollet (Universite Paris Descartes) and Keith R. Laderoute (Stanford University School of Medicine). MK2−/− cells were kindly provided by Dr. Matthias Gaestel (Hannover Medical School). The HEK293T cell line was obtained from ATCC. All cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 10 units/ml of penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. For insulin or H2O2 stimulation, cells were serum-starved for 24 h followed by insulin or H2O2 stimulation, as indicated. For glucose starvation, cells were cultured with d-glucose-free DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 25 mm HEPES and 10% dialyzed FBS. Cells were stimulated with 25 mm glucose for 15–60 min as indicated. For amino acid starvation, cells were serum-starved for 24 h and incubated in DPBS (PBS containing 25 mm glucose) for 30 min. DMEM containing all amino acids was then added for 10–30 min as indicated. 293T cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 and the corresponding empty vector was used for adjustment to ensure an equal amount of total DNA. 36 h after transfection, cells were collected using lysis buffer as indicated. For lentivirus production, 293T cells were transfected with pLV-EF1α-Cre-IRES-Bsd, pBOBI-HA-Raptor, and pBOBI-MKK6b(E) with lentivirus-packaging plasmids (VSVG/PMDL/REV) using Lipofectamine 2000. The transfected cells were cultured at 37 °C for 48 h and the virus generated was used for infection. Antibodies to phospho-S6K(T389), S6K, phospho-S6(S235/236), phospho-4EBP1(T37/46), 4EBP1, phospho-p38(T180/Y182), p38β, Raptor, and mTOR were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-phospho-Raptor(Ser863) and anti-HA(F-7) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG M2 antibodies, anti-FLAG M2 beads, and anti-HA beads were obtained from Sigma. Polyclonal antibodies to phospho-Raptor (Ser771) were generated in rabbits against keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptides (amino acids 767–775: STLG(pS)PENE) using Abmart's custom antibody service. Goat anti-mouse HRP and goat anti-rabbit HRP antibodies were from Thermo Scientific. Cells rinsed once with ice-cold PBS were lysed in ice-cold CHAPS lysis buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1.5 mm Na3VO4, 0.3% CHAPS, 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF) as described (38Kim D.H.

The soluble fractions of cell lysates were isolated by centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. For immunoprecipitations, anti-FLAG M2 beads or anti-HA beads were added to the lysates and incubated with rotation for 3 h or overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were then washed three times each with lysis buffer followed by addition of 1× SDS sample buffer, boiling for 10 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. As described (24Ma L. Chen Z. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2005; 121: 179-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar), anti-HA beads used for immunoprecipitating HA-Raptor deletions were washed three times in RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mm PMSF) followed by two additional washes in CIAP buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Beads were then incubated with 1 μl of 30 units/μl of CIAP (Takara Bio, Inc.) in 50 μl of CIAP buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by washing twice in CIAP buffer and boiling in 1× SDS sample buffer. p38β kinase assays were performed in a final volume of 20 μl consisting of p38 kinase buffer with 250 μm ATP and bacterial-derived GST-Raptor-(741–887) fragments as substrates for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by 2× SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For the mTORC1 kinase assay, 293T cells were transfected with HA-Raptor WT or S771A, S863A, and S771A/S863A mutants. Transfected cells were treated with 1 mm arsenite for 30 min as indicated in the figures and then lysed in CHAPS lysis buffer followed by immunoprecipitation by HA antibodies. As described (39Sancak Y. Thoreen C.C. Peterson T.R. Lindquist R.A. Kang S.A. Spooner E. Carr S.A. Sabatini D.M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 903-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar), the immunoprecipitates were washed three times in CHAPS lysis buffer and then twice in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm potassium chloride. Kinase assays were carried out in a volume of 15 μl consisting of mTORC1 kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 250 μm ATP) and bacterial-derived GST-S6K as a substrate for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated by 2× SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To study the effect of arsenite on mTOR activity, we measured phosphorylation levels of S6K1 and 4EBP1, substrates of mTOR, in arsenite-treated MEF cells. Arsenite-induced Thr389 phosphorylation of S6K1 and Thr37/46 phosphorylation of 4EBP1 (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1A). The induction is rapamycin sensitive, indicating arsenite-activated mTORC1 (Fig. 1A). Arsenite can activate the ERK pathway, a pathway that plays a role in EGF-stimulated mTORC1 activation (24Ma L. Chen Z. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2005; 121: 179-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). To determine whether arsenite works via ERK to activate mTORC1, we used the MEK inhibitor PD98059 and found that inhibition of the ERK pathway had no effect on arsenite-induced mTORC1 activation (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the p38α/β inhibitor SB203580 effectively inhibited arsenite-induced mTORC1 activation (Fig. 1A), suggesting involvement of the p38 pathway. To unambiguously determine the participation of the p38 pathway in arsenite-induced mTORC1 activation, and to determine which p38 group member plays the role, we analyzed arsenite-induced mTORC1 activation in p38α−/−, p38β−/−, p38γ−/−, p38δ−/−, and their corresponding p38α+/+, p38β+/+, p38γ+/+, and p38δ+/+ MEF cells. These cells were generated by in vitro treatment of the large T immortalized p38αlox/lox, p38βlox/lox, p38γlox/lox, and p38δlox/lox MEF cells with a lentivirus-expressing Cre recombinase or a control virus as described previously (35Zheng M. Wang Y.H. Wu X.N. Wu S.Q. Lu B.J. Dong M.Q. Zhang H. Sun P. Lin S.C. Guan K.L. Han J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We treated these cells with different doses of arsenite and found that only p38β deletion impaired arsenite-induced S6K1 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). To confirm this phenotype of p38β−/− MEF, we tested two pairs of primary wild-type and p38β−/− MEF cells and observed a similar deficiency in arsenite-induced mTORC1 activation (supplemental Fig. S1B). siRNA knockdown of p38β in 293T cells also reduced arsenite-induced mTORC1 activation (supplemental Fig. S1C). The importance of p38β is not due to the abundance of p38β because its expression is not higher than other p38 isoforms in MEF and 293T cells (supplemental Fig. S1, D and E). Thus, p38β is involved in arsenite-induced mTORC1 activation. It was a surprise to us that p38β plays a promoting role in arsenite-induced mTORC1 activation, because our recent study showed that the p38β-PRAK cascade negatively regulates mTORC1 in 2-deoxyglucose-treated cells (35Zheng M. Wang Y.H. Wu X.N. Wu S.Q. Lu B.J. Dong M.Q. Zhang H. Sun P. Lin S.C. Guan K.L. Han J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We did a side by side comparison and confirmed that p38β is required for 2-deoxyglucose-induced inactivation of mTORC1 and arsenite-induced activation of mTORC1 (supplemental Fig. S2). In contrast to p38β, PRAK is required for 2-deoxyglucose-induced inactivation of mTORC1 but has no role in arsenite-induced mTORC1 activation (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). It appears that p38β targets different downstream proteins to execute different functions in 2-deoxyglucose- and arsenite-treated cells. Activation of mTORC1 has been reported in a number of conditions. Replenishment of insulin, glucose, amino acid, or serum all activates mTORC1. We found that p38β was not required for mTORC1 activation under these conditions (Fig. 2, A–D). The protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin can activate a variety of intracellular signaling pathways, including the p38 and mTORC1 pathways. It was shown that serum refurnishing or anisomycin treatment both activated MK2, which in turn phosphorylates TSC2 on Ser1210 and enables TSC2 binding to 14-3-3, and thus promotes mTORC1 activation (33Li Y. Inoki K. Vacratsis P. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13663-13671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We found that, as in serum refurbishment, p38β has no role in anisomycin-induced S6K1 phosphorylation, excluding the possibility that p38β functions via MK2 to activate mTORC1 (Fig. 2E). Under serum-starved conditions, H2O2 can activate mTOR, and we found that p38β has no role in H2O2-induced mTOR activation (Fig. 2F). Collectively, of all the activation of mTORC1 tested, arsenite-induced mTORC1 activation is the only one that requires p38β. It is known that arsenite activates all p38 group members, including p38β (7Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Because of the similar size of p38 family members, there is currently no method available to specifically detect p38β activation. To determine whether p38β is activated in our experimental setting, we used transiently expressed FLAG-p38β to determine whether arsenite activates p38β. 293T cells expressing FLAG-p38β were treated with arsenite and the phosphorylation of FLAG-p38β was detected by Western blotting with anti-phospho-p38 antibodies (Fig. 3A). Arsenite-induced p38β phosphorylation and rapamycin had no effect on arsenite-induced p38β activation, suggesting that p38β activation is upstream of mTORC1. Ectopically expressing constitutively active MKK6 (MKK6b(E)) in cells can also lead to activation of all p38 group members (40Huang S. Jiang Y. Li Z. Nishida E. Mathias P. Lin S. Ulevitch R.J. Nemerow G.R. Han J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We tested whether expression of MKK6b(E) in MEF cells can mimic arsenite treatment and found a low level increase in rapamycin-sensitive S6K1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B), and found this phosphorylation to be p38β- but not PRAK-dependent (Fig. 3C). It appears that overactivation of p38β alone is sufficient to increase mTORC1 activity, but the increase of mTORC1 activity is limited. This data are consistent with the results showing that p38β deletion or SB203580 treatment did not completely inhibit arsenite-induced mTORC1 activation (Fig. 1). Because AMPK and TSC2 are important regulators of mTORC1, we determined their role in arsenite-induced mTORC1 activation. To examine whether AMPK is involved in arsenite-induced activation of mTORC1, we used AMPKα1/α2 double knock-out MEFs, and found that arsenite-induced mTORC1 activation was not affected by AMPK deletion (Fig. 4A). We then used TSC2−/− cells to determine the involvement of TSC2 and found that arsenite-induced mTORC1 activation was not affected by TSC2 deletion (Fig. 4B). As anticipated, arsenite-induced mTORC1 activity can be inhibited in TSC2−/− cells by SB203580 and rapamycin (Fig. 4C). Thus, arsenite-induced mTORC1 activation is independent from AMPK and TSC2. To elucidate the pathway of p38β-mediated mTORC1 activation, we coexpressed p38β with different components of the mTORC1 complex in 293T cells and treated the cells with or without arsenite. We immunoprecipitated HA-tagged Raptor, mLST8/GβL, Deptor, and Rheb, finding that p38β did not interact with any of these proteins in the absence of arsenite treatment, but interacted with Raptor but not mLST8/GβL, Deptor, or Rheb in the presence of arsenite stimulation (Fig. 5A). To test whether the interaction between p38β and Raptor is p38β-specific, we compared p38β with p38α in their interaction with Raptor and found that only p38β can interact with Raptor in arsenite-treated cells (Fig. 5B). We then checked whether arsenite treatment induces interaction between endogenous p38β and Raptor. 293T cells were treated with or without 1 mm arsenite for 30 min and p38β was immunoprecipitated with anti-p38β antibodies. We detected Raptor in the immunoprecipitates from arsenite-treated cells, but not in the immunoprecipitates from control non-treated cells (Fig. 5C). The specificity of p38β immunoprecipitation was demonstrated by the absence p38β and Raptor in the immunoprecipitates using control IgG (Fig. 5C). Because arsenite induces p38β activation, we examined whether the activity of p38β is"
https://openalex.org/W2084718300,"Understanding the component stoichiometry of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) triggering apparatus is essential for building realistic models of signal initiation. Recent studies suggesting that the TCR and other signaling-associated proteins are preclustered on resting T cells relied on measurements of the behavior of membrane proteins at interfaces with functionalized glass surfaces. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we show that, compared with the apical surface, the mobility of TCRs is significantly reduced at Jurkat T cell/glass interfaces, in a signaling-sensitive manner. Using two biophysical approaches that mitigate these effects, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and two-color coincidence detection microscopy, we show that, within the uncertainty of the methods, the membrane components of the TCR triggering apparatus, i.e. the TCR complex, MHC molecules, CD4/Lck and CD45, are exclusively monovalent or monomeric in human T cell lines, implying that TCR triggering depends only on the kinetics of TCR/pMHC interactions. These analyses also showed that constraining proteins to two dimensions at the cell surface greatly enhances random interactions versus those between the membrane and the cytoplasm. Simulations of TCR-pMHC complex formation based on these findings suggest how unclustered TCR triggering-associated proteins might nevertheless be capable of generating complex signaling outputs via the differential recruitment of cytosolic effectors to the cell membrane.

T lymphocytes play crucial roles in adaptive immune responses, where their surface interactions with antigen-presenting cells are critical for the detection and subsequent elimination of pathogens. Many of these receptor-ligand pairs have no intrinsic enzymatic activity, as is the case for the T cell antigen receptor (TCR), 4The abbreviations used are: TCRT cell antigen receptorBRETbioluminescence resonance energy transferFRAPfluorescence recovery after photobleachingKPkinetic proofreadingLucluciferasepMHCpeptide-major histocompatibility complexTCCDtwo-color coincidence detection. which not only has to rely on extrinsic tyrosine kinases to propagate signaling but also must do so while discriminating between ligands of differing quality. The ligands for the TCR are peptides presented in the context of the MHC molecule (pMHC) by the antigen-presenting cells. Discrimination by the TCR is intimately linked to the longevity of the TCR/pMHC interaction, where the decision to trigger can be influenced by small changes in the binding kinetics. The TCR must initiate differential signaling pathways based on these differences, from titrating positive and negative selection during thymocyte development to causing a potent immune response in the periphery.

These diverse mechanisms must all be intrinsic to the structure and organization of the antigen receptor triggering apparatus and the enzymatic processes initiated by receptor engagement (1Smith-Garvin J.E. Koretzky G.A. Jordan M.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 591-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). It is unfortunate, therefore, that the structure and organization of the receptor triggering apparatus are so mired in controversy. The TCR itself has been the most contentious and illustrates the extent to which inferences about the stoichiometry of the proteins influence thinking about mechanism (2Salzmann M. Bachmann M.F. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 3Schamel W.W. Arechaga I. Risueño R.M. van Santen H.M. Cabezas P. Risco C. Valpuesta J.M. Alarcón B. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We previously attempted to resolve this issue for the TCR using a single-molecule in situ approach that examined TCRs diffusing at the apical surface of T cells resting on a glass surface, which strongly suggested that the TCR is monovalent (4James J.R. White S.S. Clarke R.W. Johansen A.M. Dunne P.D. Sleep D.L. Fitzgerald W.J. Davis S.J. Klenerman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17662-17667Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Very recently, however, high resolution measurements of the behavior of proteins at the cell/glass interface suggested that the TCR is instead preclustered in groups of 7–25 molecules in resting cells (5Lillemeier B.F. Mörtelmaier M.A. Forstner M.B. Huppa J.B. Groves J.T. Davis M.M. Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The organization of the other components of the triggering apparatus, i.e. CD4/Lck, CD45 and MHC molecules (1Smith-Garvin J.E. Koretzky G.A. Jordan M.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 591-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar), is also contentious. In the case of the co-receptor CD4, although initial analysis of the extracellular region limited any oligomerization to a very low affinity interaction (6Davis S.J. Ward H.A. Puklavec M.J. Willis A.C. Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10410-10418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), functional significance has been attributed to homodimeric interactions of the membrane-proximal domain observed in crystals of its extracellular region (7Wu H. Kwong P.D. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). CD45 has no apparent ligand, but there has been much interest in the possibility that it too is regulated by oligomerization. An initial structure of a tyrosine phosphatase domain revealed a homodimer in the lattice (8Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and suggested a general mechanism of phosphatase inhibition (9Hoffmann K.M. Tonks N.K. Barford D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27505-27508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). More recently it was proposed that CD45 is regulated by glycosylation-controlled dimerization of its extracellular region (10Xu Z. Weiss A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 764-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Finally, there has been speculation that MHC class II forms functional dimers of dimers, based principally on the first crystal structure of HLA-DR (11Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Stern L.J.

However, other evidence points to there being no higher level of organization above the MHC heterodimer (discussed in Ref. 13Choudhuri K. van der Merwe P.A. Semin. Immunol. 2007; 19: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and a role for its oligomerization in T cell activation is unproven (12Hayball J.D. Lake R.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 273: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Here we readdress the stoichiometry of the TCR (4James J.R. White S.S. Clarke R.W. Johansen A.M. Dunne P.D. Sleep D.L.

We present evidence that contact with a functionalized glass surface alters the behavior of the TCR, complicating measurements at this interface. We show that the components of the TCR triggering apparatus are all largely if not completely monovalent or monomeric and that these membrane-bound molecules participate in unexpectedly high levels of nonspecific association within the membrane due to an increase in their effective concentration, in marked contrast to membrane and cytosolic proteins, whose encounters are likely to be much less frequent. Because the TCR requires recruitment of a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase to the membrane, we speculate that these rate differences could affect the mode and tempo of signaling by this receptor. HEK-293T cells used in the BRET experiments were grown in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma), 2 mm glutamine (Sigma), and antibiotics (Sigma) and passaged using trypsin (Sigma). The Jurkat, J.RT3, J45, and PM1 T cell lines and THP-1 monocyte cell line were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mm HEPES (Sigma), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) and antibiotics. Oligonucleotide primers and cloning strategies used in this study can be found in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. Transient transfection of HEK-293T was performed using GeneJuice (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the TCRβ BRET assay, VSV-G pseudotyped virus produced from transiently transfected HEK-293T cells was used to infect 5 × 105 J.RT3 cells with the TCRβLuc vector for 16 h. Infected cells were recovered, stained for surface expression of CD3ϵ, and cell sorted by using a MoFlo cell sorter, forming the J.Luc line. These cells were then infected in an analogous manner with the TCRβGFP or CD3ϵGFP vectors, and the cell sorter was used to define four subpopulations with increasing GFP expression. FRAP was performed as described by Ayoub et al. (15Ayoub N. Jeyasekharan A.D. Bernal J.A. Venkitaraman A.R. Nature. 2008; 453: 682-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 × 106 cells were labeled at 4 °C for at least 30 min with saturating UCHT1 Alexa Fluor 488-labeled Fab. Cells were washed and added to glass-bottomed dishes for imaging on a Zeiss LSM510 at 37 °C in PBS, using a 40 × 1.2 NA lens with the 488-nm line of an argon laser operating at 6.1 A. A circular region ∼2 μm in diameter was bleached using 100% laser intensity for 2.4 s. The aperture of the pinhole was adjusted to obtain slices of <2 μm depth. Images were acquired postbleaching every second, with bleaching and background corrected for. To obtain the asymptotic fluorescence values (F∞), each recovery curve was fitted to Equation 1 in Ref. 16Dushek O. Coombs D. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 2008; 70: 1224-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar. The BRET assay was performed essentially as described (17James J.R. Oliveira M.I. Carmo A.M. Iaboni A. Davis S.J. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 1001-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), except for CD45Ex, which was transfected for 48 h to give as high a level of wild-type expression as possible. For the CD4/Lck co-expression experiments, a constant amount (0.5 μg) of the Lck-mCherry (or MyrNck1-mCherry) vector was used in combination with varying ratios of CD4Luc to CD4GFP (total DNA of 0.5 μg), and expression of the mCherry-tagged proteins was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. For the J.Luc cell lines expressing either TCRβGFP or CD3ϵGFP, 5 × 106 cells of each subpopulation were pelleted, resuspended to 200 μl in PBS, and the BRETeff values measured as for the normal assay. The principles and experimental setup of TCCD have been described previously (4James J.R. White S.S. Clarke R.W. Johansen A.M. Dunne P.D. Sleep D.L. Fitzgerald W.J. Davis S.J. Klenerman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17662-17667Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Antibodies to CD2 (OKT11), CD3 (UCHT1), CD45 (GAP8.3), and HLA-DR (L243) were purified from hybridoma supernatant using protein A or G. Anti-CD4 (Q4120) antibody was obtained from the Centre for AIDS reagents, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, UK. All antibodies were fragmented to Fabs using immobilized papain and labeled with either Alexa Fluor 488 or 647. The TCCD dataset for CD2 was used to define a 95% confidence interval to assign monomeric interactions for the TCCD data, defined as the mean ± 1.96 × S.E. This equation was also used to calculate the confidence interval at each time point of the FRAP datasets. When required, measurement error was appropriately propagated. We have previously made use of two techniques, BRET (17James J.R. Oliveira M.I. Carmo A.M. Iaboni A. Davis S.J. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 1001-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and TCCD (4James J.R. White S.S. Clarke R.W. Johansen A.M. Dunne P.D. Sleep D.L. Fitzgerald W.J. Davis S.J. Klenerman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17662-17667Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), to probe membrane protein stoichiometry in situ. BRET detects the physical proximity of fluorophore-tagged proteins by measuring the efficiency of energy transfer (BRETeff) from a donor (luciferase, Luc) to acceptor (green fluorescent protein, GFP) and is highly dependent on donor/acceptor separation, effectively limited to distances of 3–10 nm. By varying the ratio of the acceptor-tagged proteins to those of the donor-fused versions, it is possible to derive additional information about whether physical proximity is due to a random or a specific oligomeric interaction, at near physiological levels of protein expression. BRET-based stoichiometric analysis does require the use of nonnative reporter constructs in heterologous cells. Complementing this approach, therefore, is TCCD, which permits the organization of native proteins to be studied. TCCD uses monovalent antibody fragments (Fabs) labeled with either of two spectrally distinct fluorophores to detect proteins of interest. By focusing two overlapping lasers at the cell surface, it is possible to resolve fluorescence bursts corresponding to single molecules passing through the confocal volume. The spatio-temporal coincidence (i.e. co-localization in time) of the bursts from each fluorophore is used to detect associated proteins. The level of interaction, expressed as the association quotient value, Q, is the fraction of all detected fluorophores exhibiting coincidence, after correction for random events (4James J.R. White S.S. Clarke R.W. Johansen A.M. Dunne P.D. Sleep D.L. Fitzgerald W.J. Davis S.J. Klenerman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17662-17667Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Importantly, the measurement of Q does not rely on any physical process and so is only length-limited by the size of the confocal region, ∼500 nm. The analysis software used to process the data optimizes the threshold above which fluorescence bursts are detected. This alters the effective detection region so that the rate of detected bursts falls within the single molecule range, allowing calculation of Q (4James J.R. White S.S. Clarke R.W. Johansen A.M. Dunne P.D. Sleep D.L. Fitzgerald W.J. Davis S.J. Klenerman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17662-17667Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Clarke R.W. Orte A. Klenerman D. Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 2771-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This results in the detection of comparable numbers of red and blue events in the experiments. The coincident event rates, the rates of red and blue events, and the total numbers of cells and events analyzed in the present experiments are given in Table 1. The absolute number of labeled proteins per cell, measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, was above 10,000/cell in all experiments (data not shown).TABLE 1Association quotients for T cell surface proteins labeled at 37 °C with fluorescently labeled Fab fragments, together with the significant event rate (the rate of coincident events above the rate due to random diffusion), the rate of red and blue events, and the numbers of cells and events analyzedCellsAssociation quotientCoincidence rateRed event rateBlue event rateNo. of cells analyzedNo. of files analyzeds−1s−1s−1JurkatsCD2/CD25.5 ± 2.10.3310.47.72256CD4/CD43.6 ± 1.80.318.67.62880CD45/CD454.0 ± 1.50.319.28.31578PM1CD4/CD41.9 ± 2.60.328.09.02968CD45/CD458.2 ± 3.80.459.08.53280CD4/CD455.7 ± 2.90.369.67.43374CD3/CD328.4 ± 4.30.317.67.6102172THPMHCII/MHCII5.2 ± 2.20.278.36.64379 Open table in a new tab Recent experiments have suggested that proteins involved in triggering are preclustered prior to activation (5Lillemeier B.F. Mörtelmaier M.A. Forstner M.B. Huppa J.B. Groves J.T. Davis M.M. Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). This evidence derives from resolving proteins at the plasma membrane in close apposition to a supporting glass slide or bilayer. We wanted to determine whether there was any significant difference between collecting stoichiometric data from the apical (upper) or basal (lower) T cell membranes. To do this, we performed a FRAP experiment on both surfaces of the same cell attached to a polylysine-coated coverslip, as previously used by Lillemeier et al. (5Lillemeier B.F. Mörtelmaier M.A. Forstner M.B. Huppa J.B. Groves J.T. Davis M.M. Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Wild-type Jurkat T cells, and CD45low J45 and Lck-deficient J.CaM1.6 cells were each labeled with a fluorophore-conjugated Fab against a component of the TCR (CD3ϵ) and allowed to settle for at least 5 min onto the coated glass surface. Following photobleaching, we observed a striking difference between the apical and basal regions for the wild-type Jurkat cells (p = 0.002), with much lower recovery found at the basal surface (Fig. 1A). The fraction of mobile TCR measured for the apical surface is ∼100%, in excellent agreement with previous measurements (19Dushek O. Mueller S. Soubies S. Depoil D. Caramalho I. Coombs D. Valitutti S. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3913Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas it is reduced to ∼58% on the basal surface. In contrast, for the J45 and J.CaM1.6 cells, which cannot be physiologically activated (20Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Schultz T. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 2037-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 21Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar), we observed no significant differences (p = 0.118, 0.244, respectively) in the mobility of the TCR complex at the two surfaces, suggesting that there is at most only a modest effect of the glass surface on TCR dynamics in the absence of triggering (Fig. 1, B and C). Given that the “preclustered” TCR complexes previously observed were essentially static (5Lillemeier B.F. Mörtelmaier M.A. Forstner M.B. Huppa J.B. Groves J.T. Davis M.M. Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the functionalized surface may have induced some weak triggering of the TCR, with at least a quarter of the labeled TCRs likely becoming clustered compared with the equivalent region of the J45 or J.CaM1.6 cells. It also means that to determine the organization of endogenous proteins on the T cell surface in a basal state it is essential to perform experiments on the apical cell surface, as in the case of the TCCD experiments described here and elsewhere (4James J.R. White S.S. Clarke R.W. Johansen A.M. Dunne P.D. Sleep D.L. Fitzgerald W.J. Davis S.J. Klenerman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17662-17667Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the murine TCR complex is monovalent using TCCD analysis (4James J.R. White S.S. Clarke R.W. Johansen A.M. Dunne P.D. Sleep D.L. Fitzgerald W.J. Davis S.J. Klenerman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17662-17667Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Despite demonstrating that the antibody fragment used to detect the antigen receptor did not affect TCR triggering, the caveat still remained that Fab binding interfered with the basal stoichiometry of the complex. We used BRET-based analysis, which localizes the label to the cytoplasmic domain, to circumvent this possibility. The complete TCR complex cannot readily be transfected into cells, which prevents systematic variation of the acceptor/donor ratios required for conventional BRET analysis, necessitating an alternative approach. The J.RT3 cell line is a derivative of the Jurkat T cell that lacks TCRβ expression, resulting in the receptor being absent from the cell surface (22Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Van den Elsen P. Yanagi Y. Yoshikai Y. Calman A.F. Terhorst C. Stobo J.D. Weiss A. Nature. 1985; 316: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Using viral gene transduction, we stably expressed native TCRβ fused to luciferase (TCRβLuc), producing the J.Luc cell line, which restores expression of the TCR (supplemental Fig. 1). We reasoned that if the TCR complex was multivalent then more than one TCRβ chain must be present in each complex. Therefore, by co-expressing a GFP-tagged version of TCRβ (TCRβGFP) in the J.Luc cells, we would expect to see significant energy transfer between the two fluorophores (analogous to “type 2” BRET experiments) (17James J.R. Oliveira M.I. Carmo A.M. Iaboni A. Davis S.J. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 1001-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Cells expressing both TCRβLuc and TCRβGFP were sorted into four subpopulations with increasing GFP. The assay was then carried out on these sublines and the BRETeff values plotted against fluorescence (Fig. 2). The values were low and tended to zero when extrapolated to minimal levels of GFP expression, consistent with the observed energy transfer being the result of random interactions within the membrane rather than oligomerization of the TCRβ chains. To confirm this, CD3ϵGFP was expressed as the acceptor in J.Luc cells. At the low levels of expression sorted for in each population, it is very unlikely that both chains in the minimal complex were GFP-tagged, because CD3ϵGFP must compete with native CD3ϵ for incorporation into the TCR. Because CD3ϵ is an obligate component of the minimal receptor complex, we expected these constructs to define the maximal energy transfer between TCR chains within the complex. BRETeff for CD3ϵGFP-expressing J.Luc cells was indeed substantially higher than that measured for J.Luc cells expressing TCRβGFP and did not extrapolate to zero at low expression (Fig. 2). In BRET experiments, it is not possible to distinguish between surface and intracellular signals, but our assumption is that the contribution of the intracellular signals should be equivalent between the TCRβLuc/TCRβGFP and the TCRβLuc/CD3ϵGFP experiments. We conclude from these experiments that the TCR contains only a single TCRβ chain, or that only a fraction of the minimal complexes form oligomers. The ratio between the TCR/TCR and TCR/CD3ϵ datasets of BRETeff extrapolated to zero expression gives an estimate of this fraction, which would correspond to 0.10 ± 0.11. Oligomer formation is, however, very unlikely given the results of the TCCD analysis of the murine TCR (4James J.R. White S.S. Clarke R.W. Johansen A.M. Dunne P.D. Sleep D.L. Fitzgerald W.J. Davis S.J. Klenerman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17662-17667Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A monovalent TCR is likely to bind a monovalent ligand. Because the correct expression of MHC molecules is intimately linked with the process of peptide loading, heterologous expression of the heterodimer is unlikely to mimic the physiological assembly or localization of the protein, making TCCD the most appropriate assay for MHC oligomerization. To define the dynamic range of the technique for human cells and to establish a positive control for our subsequent analyses, we first confirmed that we could detect two CD3ϵ chains within each TCR complex of the PM1 human T cell line (a HUT78 derivative; Fig. 3A). We then used the adhesion receptor, CD2, which is known to be monomeric (17James J.R. Oliveira M.I. Carmo A.M. Iaboni A. Davis S.J. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 1001-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), to define the value of Q expected for nonassociated plasma membrane proteins. Human CD2 expressed by PM1 cells gave a nonzero value for Q that was significantly lower than that obtained for CD3ϵ (Fig. 3A) and equivalent to that observed previously for monomeric control proteins (4James J.R. White S.S. Clarke R.W. Johansen A.M. Dunne P.D. Sleep D.L. Fitzgerald W.J. Davis S.J. Klenerman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17662-17667Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This demonstrated that monomers and dimers present on human cells are readily distinguishable. The monocyte line THP-1 was used to determine the stoichiometry of the MHC class II molecule, HLA-DR. Generally, MHC expression on antigen-presenting cells is extremely high and outside the regime of single-molecule detection required for TCCD. However, THP-1 cells express a low level of HLA-DR prior to differentiation to macrophages (23Yunis J.J. Band H. Bonneville F. Yunis E.J. Blood. 1989; 73: 931-937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), allowing TCCD analysis. We found no evidence for the formation of dimers of dimers at the antigen-presenting cell surface (Fig. 3B), with the level of association consistent with HLA-DR, and presumably all MHC class II molecules being monovalent as in the case of their class I counterparts (13Choudhuri K. van der Merwe P.A. Semin. Immunol. 2007; 19: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We used both BRET and TCCD to determine whether CD4 oligomerizes at the T cell surface. Full-length CD4 was genetically fused to either Luc or GFP and expressed as a “BRET pair” in HEK-293T cells at physiologically meaningful levels (i.e. in the range of 103-105 molecules/cell; supplemental Fig. 2), as described previously (17James J.R. Oliveira M.I. Carmo A.M. Iaboni A. Davis S.J. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 1001-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The BRETeff values measured for CD4 were high and dependent on the acceptor/donor ratio, indicative of an oligomeric interaction (Fig. 4A). BRETeff for CD4 was comparable with that for CD80, a membrane protein where the monomeric and dimeric forms are in equilibrium (17James J.R. Oliveira M.I. Carmo A.M. Iaboni A. Davis S.J. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 1001-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Because the dissociation constant for CD80 homodimerization is ∼ 35 μm (24Ikemizu S. Gilbert R.J. Fennelly J.A. Collins A.V. Harlos K. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. Davis S.J. Immunity. 2000; 12: 51-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), it suggested factors other than the putative membrane-proximal domain interaction (Kd > 1 mm) (7Wu H. Kwong P.D. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) were likely to contribute to the CD4 association. Furthermore, the acceptor/donor ratio dependence of the BRETeff values could be readily fitted as an oligomeric association (n ≥ 3) but not as a dimeric one (Fig. 4A). To test whether the membrane-proximal domain interaction seen in sCD4 crystals (7Wu H. Kwong P.D. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) was responsible for the oligomerization observed, we mutated the two residues, CD4K318E and CD4Q344E, believed to disrupt it (25Moldovan M.C. Yachou A. Lévesque K. Wu H. Hendrickson W.A. Cohen E.A. Sékaly R.P. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6261-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These mutations had no effect on BRETeff (Fig. 4B), implying that CD4 does not oligomerize via the interface observed in the crystals. We also excluded the unpaired cysteines in the intracellular region by mutating them to serine (CD4ΔCys) and repeating the assay (Fig. 4B). To identify the region of CD4 causing the observed oligomerization, a series of truncations of the protein was generated: CD4Ex lacked the intracellular region, CD4Int lacked the extracellular region, and CD4TM consisted only of the transmembrane segment of the protein. The CD4Ex and CD4TM constructs gave BRETeff profiles that were indistinguishable from monomeric proteins (17James J.R. Oliveira M.I. Carmo A.M. Iaboni A. Davis S.J. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 1001-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), indicating that the self-association of CD4 is driven solely by its intracellular region ("
https://openalex.org/W2116945866,"Although cancer cells have traditionally been thought to rely on the glycolytic pathway to generate ATP, recent studies suggest that cancer cells can shift to the fatty acid oxidation pathway as an alternative energy source. All of the factors that induce and regulate this adaptive shift in metabolism are not known. Cyclooxygenase-2-derived prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) is produced at high levels in colon cancer, and multiple lines of evidence from human-, animal-, and cell line-based studies indicate that PGE(2) plays a pro-oncogenic role in colorectal cancer progression. We have shown previously that exposure of colon cancer cells to PGE(2) promotes cell survival, in part by inducing the expression of the nuclear orphan receptor NR4A2. Here, we report that PGE(2)-induced NR4A2 increased fatty acid oxidation by inducing the expression of multiple proteins in the fatty acid oxidation pathway. NR4A2 was found to bind directly to Nur77-binding response elements located within the regulatory region of these genes. Nur77-binding response element binding also resulted in the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators and induction of gene expression. Collectively, our findings suggest that NR4A2 plays a key role as a transcriptional integration point between the eicosanoid and fatty acid metabolic pathways. Thus, PGE(2) is a potential regulator of the adaptive shift to energy utilization via fatty acid oxidation that has been observed in several types of cancer."

UPR is initiated by the activation of three major sensors at the ER membrane: inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), PKR-like-ER kinase, and activating transcription factor 6. Activation of UPR leads to the induction of chaperones, and ER-associated degradation components, global translational attenuation, is required for the maintenance of ER function, clearance of misfolded proteins from the ER, and if stress persists, induction of apoptosis (1Ron D.

The ER luminal domain of IRE1α protein is critical for sensing ER stress and subsequent IRE1α activation. Although earlier studies of human IRE1α have suggested that IRE1α dimers are sufficient for its activity (11Liu C.Y. Schröder M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol.

Walter P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 16113-16118Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The formation of IRE1α foci in response to ER stress is believed to juxtapose the IRE1α kinase and RNase domains, thereby allowing for a more efficient way to relay signals emanating from the ER lumen. One outstanding question is the importance of and the molecular mechanism underlying the activation of mammalian IRE1α RNase and kinase domains. Some recent studies have shed light on this question. First, kinase-defective K599A mutant abolishes the RNase activity of IRE1α, suggesting that kinase activity and trans-autophosphorylation of IRE1α protein are important for the activation of its RNase domain (15Korennykh A.V. Egea P.F. Korostelev A.A. Finer-Moore J. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Nature. 2009; 457: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). This is likely achieved by phosphorylation-induced conformational changes. Moreover, a previous study reported the failure to express stable forms of individual kinase and RNase domains (18Lee K.P. Dey M. Neculai D. Cao C. Dever T.E. Sicheri F. Cell. 2008; 132: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Together, these studies imply that the two cytosolic domains of IRE1α protein are functionally linked via autophosphorylation. However, two recent studies suggested a dispensable role of IRE1α phosphorylation in activation of its RNase domain (19Han D. Lerner A.G. Vande Walle L. Upton J.P. Xu W. Hagen A. Backes B.J.

Nonetheless, the identification of these mutants allowed us to address how cancer-associated mutations may affect IRE1α structure and function. The relative positions of these mutations in the kinase domain of the active form of yeast IRE1α protein (15Korennykh A.V. Egea P.F. Korostelev A.A. Finer-Moore J. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Nature. 2009; 457: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), based on homology, are shown in Fig. 1B. To determine the impact of these mutants on IRE1α activity, we generated IRE1α−/− MEF cells stably expressing the mutant proteins and assessed IRE1α phosphorylation in response to ER stress using Phos-tag gels as we recently described (22Sha H. He Y. Chen H. Wang C. Zenno A. Shi H. Yang X. Zhang X. Qi L. Cell Metab. 2009; 9: 556-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 27Yang L. Xue Z. He Y. Sun S. Chen H. Qi L. PLos ONE. 2010; 5: e11621Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Qi L. Yang L. Chen H. Methods Enzymol. 2011; 490: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that the slower migrating band on the Phos-tag gel represents the phosphorylated form of IRE1α, and the ratio of phosphorylated to total IRE1α correlates with the amount of ER stress (27Yang L. Xue Z. He Y. Sun S. Chen H. Qi L. PLos ONE. 2010; 5: e11621Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Qi L. Yang L. Chen H. Methods Enzymol. 2011; 490: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Strikingly, mutation of IRE1α at either S769F or P830L, but not R635W or L474R, abolished IRE1α mobility shift upon Tg treatment, indicative of defective IRE1α kinase activity (Fig. 2A, lanes 7–14, and Fig. 2B, lanes 1–8). Of note, we were not able to detect N244S and Q780-stop mutants due to technical reasons. Quantitation of the percent of p-IRE1α in total IRE1α from at least two independent experiments is shown in Fig. 2D. It is worth noting that it is necessary to use Phos-tag gels to analyze phosphorylation of IRE1α mutants because p-IRE1α did not separate well in regular gels under the same running conditions (Fig. 2, B and C). The kinase-dead K599A mutant (17Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar) exhibited no IRE1α phosphorylation whereas the dimerization-defective D123P mutant (14Zhou J. Liu C.Y. Back S.H. Clark R.L. Peisach D. Xu Z. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 14343-14348Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) showed a 70% reduction (lanes 7, 8, 10, and 11, and Fig. 2C). As additional controls, mutations at S548D and T973D had no effect on IRE1α phosphorylation upon ER stress (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–6). Supporting the notion that the slower migrating band is due to phosphorylation, phosphatase treatment abolished the bandshift in WT IRE1α (Fig. 2C, lane 3); by contrast, there was no change in the electrophoretic mobility of P830L IRE1α following phosphatase treatment (Fig. 2C, lanes 4–6). To examine the effect on RNase activity, we assessed the production of XBP1s protein by Western blotting. K599A completely and D123P partially abolished XBP1s production (Fig. 2F, lower, lanes 5–8) whereas other mutations such as K748A and T973D (Fig. 2F, lower, lanes 9–12) had no effect. XBP1s protein was barely detectable in IRE1α−/− MEFs expressing P830L or S769F (Fig. 2F, upper, lanes 9–12) but was less affected in cells expressing L474R or R635W (Fig. 2F, upper, lanes 5–8). This was also confirmed by RT-PCR analysis of Xbp1 mRNA splicing (supplemental Fig. S1). Taken together, among the four cancer-associated mutants, our data showed that P830L and S769F mutations had detrimental effects on IRE1α kinase and RNase functions whereas L474R and R635W had no major impact. We then examined the potential effects of the two loss-of-function mutants on IRE1α structure (Fig. 3A). Based on the structure of human IRE1α (26Ali M.M. Bagratuni T. Davenport E.L. Nowak P.R. Silva-Santisteban M.C. Hardcastle A. McAndrews C. Rowlands M.G. Morgan G.J. Aherne W. Collins I. Davies F.E. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2011; 30: 894-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), Ser769 is located in the kinase domain (Fig. 3A). Replacement of the serine with a bulky phenylalanine residue causes sterical collisions with at least two neighboring residues, Tyr765 and Cys794 (Fig. 3B), which may affect the stability and activation of the kinase domain. Although Cys794 is not conserved, both Ser769 and Tyr765 are highly evolutionally conserved (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, Pro830 is located at the junction between the kinase and RNase domains (Fig. 3A). Further analysis revealed that Pro830 may form a highly hydrophobic patch with Trp833 and Tyr945 or with Leu941 on the other side (Fig. 3C). Based on this, mutation of Pro830 to Leu was not favored as the side chain of leucine would contact the Trp833 and Tyr945 residues (Fig. 3C), or Leu941 in the other direction (data not shown), and hence, disrupt this structural element. All four residues involved in this structural motif (Pro830, Trp833, Leu941, and Tyr945) were highly conserved in both IRE1α and IRE1β proteins through evolution from yeast to humans (Fig. 3E), suggesting that the Pro830-containing structural determinant bridging the two domains of IRE1α may be critical for IRE1α activation in a highly conserved manner. We speculated that understanding the effect of P830L may provide insight into the importance of the region linking the kinase and RNase domains of IRE1α, hereafter termed the “linker.” Therefore, in the remainder of this study, we focused on the Pro830 residue. We next attempted to delineate the effect of this hydrophobic patch consisting of Pro830, Trp833, and Tyr945 or Leu941 on IRE1α activation by mutagenesis. Interestingly, W833A caused a dramatic defect on IRE1α phosphorylation similar to that of P830L in response to ER stress (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 and 8), and to a lesser extent, for Y945A (Fig. 4A, lanes 11 and 12), but not L941A (Fig. 4A, lanes 9 and 10). To exclude the possibility that the P830L effect was caused by random mutations generated at other sites during mutagenesis, we mutated P830L back to P (P830L→P). Indeed, the P830L→P mutation fully restored the WT phenotype (Fig. 4B, lanes 13 and 14). Pointing to the importance of the Pro830 position, mutation at the nearby P821L, also a highly conserved residue (Fig. 3E), had only a minor effect (∼20%) on IRE1α phosphorylation (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 6). Moreover, mutation of Pro830 to alanine (P830A) caused a much milder defect in IRE1α phosphorylation relative to the P830L mutant, with ∼70% of IRE1α being phosphorylated under ER stress (Fig. 4, B and C, lanes 1 and 2). Next, we asked whether mutating Tyr945 or Trp833 to a smaller residue such as alanine could reverse the detrimental effect of P830L by accommodating the leucine residue. However, the double mutants of P830L/Y945A or P830L/W833A exhibited the same phenotype as P830L with no IRE1α phosphorylation in response to ER stress (Fig. 4B, lanes 7, 8, 11, and 12). Quantitation of IRE1α activation in all mutants is shown in Fig. 4C. We then checked the RNase activity of these mutants by assessing the protein levels of XBP1s using Western blotting. Indeed, XBP1 protein levels correlated well with the extent of IRE1α phosphorylation: the P830L, W833A, and Y945A mutations led to no XBP1 production in response to ER stress and to a much lesser extent for L941A and P830A (Fig. 4D). As a positive control, RNase-dead K907A mutant (25Tirasophon W. Lee K. Callaghan B. Welihinda A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2725-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) with normal IRE1α phosphorylation (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6) was defective in XBP1 production in response to ER stress (Fig. 4D). Taken together, our data showed that three residues, Pro830, Trp833, and Tyr945, not Leu941, likely form a structural linker that is critical for IRE1α function. To shed further light on the defects caused by P830L, we examined the stability of IRE1α mutants under basal conditions. IRE1α−/− MEFs stably expressing various mutant proteins were treated with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, for the indicated time periods followed by Western blot analysis of IRE1α protein levels. Although K599A had a half-life similar to that of WT protein (t½ = 12 h; Fig. 5, A and B), the P830L, W833A, and Y945A mutations dramatically reduced the half-life of IRE1α to 6 h or less (Fig. 5, D–F). Pointing to the specificity of these three residues, L941A had no effect on IRE1α stability (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these results suggested that P830L, W833A, and Y945A mutations at the linker region had a significant impact on IRE1α protein stability, an effect distinct from the kinase-dead K599A mutation. As mammalian IRE1α oligomerizes upon ER stress (16Li H. Korennykh A.V. Behrman S.L. Walter P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 16113-16118Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), we next tested the effect of P830L on foci formation. To this end, we used an inducible system to detect IRE1α foci formation in T-REx293 cells (16Li H. Korennykh A.V. Behrman S.L. Walter P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 16113-16118Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A). Using co-expression of ER-localized dsRed encoded in the pDsRed2-ER plasmid, we first confirmed that exogenous WT and mutant IRE1α proteins were predominantly localized to the ER (supplemental Fig. S2). In line with a previous study (16Li H. Korennykh A.V. Behrman S.L. Walter P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 16113-16118Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), foci formation peaked in cells expressing WT-IRE1α protein upon 4-h treatment of 300 nm TG (Fig. 6B and data not shown). Interestingly, unlike WT IRE1α, P830L failed to form foci upon ER stress (Fig. 6C) as did the dimerization-defective D123P IRE1α (Fig. 6D). Thus, the Pro830-containing structural linker of IRE1α affects its oligomerization in response to ER stress. To test whether mutant IRE1α protein would have a dominant negative effect on endogenous IRE1α protein, we transfected mutant proteins into HEK293T cells and tested for an ER stress response. Surprisingly, despite being expressed 10-fold more than endogenous protein levels, exogenous mutant proteins failed to reduce IRE1α activity significantly as assessed by XBP1 protein levels (Fig. 6E). Thus, the P830L mutant does not act as a dominant negative mutation but rather may serve as a loss-of-function mutation. This is the first study addressing how cancer-associated IRE1α mutations affect its structure and function. Here, we have identified an important structural element that is critical for the function of IRE1α. This structural linker consisting of Pro830, Trp833, and Tyr945 bridges the cytosolic kinase and RNase domains of IRE1α protein. Disturbance of this linker structure abolishes the activities of both functional domains and prevents IRE1α foci formation in response to ER stress. This mechanism is likely to be evolutionarily conserved as these three residues are highly conserved from yeast to humans. Although it remains unclear how P830L may affect tumor development in vivo (which is not the focus of this study), this study demonstrates that the P830L mutation is deleterious for IRE1α stability and function. How the folding and activation of the two cytosolic domains of IRE1α are coupled in vivo remains unclear. Currently, one prevailing model is that the activation of the RNase domain of IRE1α depends on the trans-autophosphorylation of its adjacent kinase domain following dimerization or oligomerization (1Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4806) Google Scholar, 18Lee K.P. Dey M. Neculai D. Cao C. Dever T.E. Sicheri F. Cell. 2008; 132: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Efforts to understand this phosphorylation-mediated regulatory event further are hampered by an incomprehensive knowledge of all of the specific phosphorylated residues on mammalian IRE1α protein. In yeast, an estimated 17 Ser/Thr residues located at both the activation loop and the adjacent αEF-αF loop are believed to be phosphorylated under ER stress (15Korennykh A.V. Egea P.F. Korostelev A.A. Finer-Moore J. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Nature. 2009; 457: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Although we predict that trans-autophosphorylation of mammalian IRE1α protein is not likely to be as extensive as in yeast, as indicated by a single shift in the Phos-tag-based Western blots (22Sha H.

Methods Enzymol. 2011; 490: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the identities and the importance of these possible phosphorylation events on mammalian IRE1α activation remain an interesting question. Our data suggest that the Pro830-Trp833-Tyr945 residues in the IRE1α hydrophobic core are important for its folding and activation. This linker region affects not only the activities of the kinase and RNase domains, but also its half-life and the ER stress-induced oligomerization. The effect of Pro830-related mutations on IRE1α function is indeed more severe than the kinase-dead K599A or the dimerization-defective D123P mutants, suggesting that Pro830-related mutations may interfere with the folding process of IRE1α protein. How we can translate this finding to therapeutic purposes require further studies. We thank the Qi laboratory for helpful discussions; Dr. C. J. Bayles for the help with confocal microscopy; Drs. C.

These systems couple a broad range of external or internal signals to regulation of diverse fundamental processes, such as metabolism, motility, and virulence (1Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar, 2Hoch J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 3Gao R. Stock A.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 63: 133-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Typical TCSs are composed of a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator protein (RR) usually encoded by a pair of adjacent genes. Both the HK and the RR are multidomain proteins. The N termini of HKs are diverse and usually contain sensory or “input ” domains that respond to environmental stimuli to activate the transmitter domain. The transmitter domain consists of two distinct subdomains: an ATP-binding HATPase domain involved in the autophosphorylation of the HK at the conserved histidine residue in a His-containing phosphoacceptor (dimerization) His kinase A (HisKA) domain (4Galperin M.Y. Nikolskaya A.N. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 422: 47-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The phosphoryl group is then transferred from this histidine residue to an aspartate residue in the receiver domain of the RR partner. This phosphorylation activates C-terminal effector or “output ” domain of RR, which executes an appropriate cellular response. The majority of RR effectors are nucleic acid binding domains acting as transcriptional regulators. The remaining RRs contain domains that can be categorized in enzymatic, stand alone, or protein/ligand binding domains (3Gao R. Stock A.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 63: 133-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). A significant part of the RRs containing enzymatic domains (6% of all RRs) are found in proteins involved in the biosynthesis of cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP), highlighting the relationship between TCSs and the c-di-GMP cellular level.c-di-GMP is an ubiquitous second messenger that has emerged as a key player in bacterial signaling. Actually, it was found to regulate main functions such as biofilm formation, virulence, motility, differentiation, and cell-cell signaling (5Hengge R. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar) and was recently shown to control an original “flagellar brake” mechanism (6Boehm A. Kaiser M. Li H. Spangler C. Kasper C.A.

Cell. 2010; 38: 128-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Proteins involved in the metabolism of c-di-GMP exhibit GGDEF and/or EAL domains responsible for the synthesis and hydrolysis of this secondary metabolite, via their diguanylate cyclase (DGC) and phosphodiesterase (PDE) activities, respectively.The majority of sequenced bacterial genomes encode more than one gene encoding GGDEF/EAL proteins, and they are particularly expanded in gamma proteobacteria with a median of 22 genes/genome (9Seshasayee A.S. Fraser G.M. Luscombe N.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 5970-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This had led to the question on how the activities of these different GGDEF or EAL proteins are regulated. A first level of regulation resides in transcriptional regulation. Most of the 28 GGDEF/EAL domain-encoding genes in Escherichia coli are expressed during entry into stationary phase, with 15 being under sigma S control (10Sommerfeldt N. Possling A. Becker G. Pesavento C. Tschowri N. Hengge R. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 1318-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In Legionella pneumophila, 18 of the 24 GGDEF/EAL domain-encoding genes are up-regulated in transmission phase, the extracellular stationary phase (11Brüggemann H. Hagman A. Jules M. Sismeiro O. Dillies M.A. Gouyette C. Kunst F. Steinert M. Heuner K. Coppée J.Y. Buchrieser C. Cell Microbiol. 2006; 8: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Given that many proteins are expressed under the same condition, their spatial control and post-translational regulation must be also critical as suggested by the variety of sensory domains associated with these proteins, consistent with multiple signal input in an extra-host environment (9Seshasayee A.S. Fraser G.M. Luscombe N.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 5970-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Karatan E. Watnick P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73: 310-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). However, the question remains what determines the overall activity of hybrid proteins that contain both GGDEF and EAL domains and thus present a “biochemical conundrum” (13Ryan R.P. Fouhy Y. Lucey J.F. Dow J.M. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8327-8334Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In many cases, only one of the GGDEF or EAL domain seems to be catalytically active (5Hengge R. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, three proteins showing both activities have been identified, so far raising question on how the two activities are reciprocally regulated: MSDGC-1 in Mycobacterium smegmatis (14Kumar M. Chatterji D. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 2942-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), BphG1 in Rhodobacter sphaeroides (15Tarutina M. Ryjenkov D.A. Gomelsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34751-34758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and ScrC in Vibrio parahemeolyticus (14Kumar M. Chatterji D. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 2942-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Tarutina M. Ryjenkov D.A. Gomelsky M. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It was proposed that these proteins could switch between states that are able to synthesize and hydrolyze c-di-GMP (13Ryan R.P. Fouhy Y. Lucey J.F. Dow J.M. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8327-8334Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction between ScrC and two accessory proteins, ScrA and ScrB, influences the balance between DGC and PDE activities of ScrC in V. parahemeolyticus (16Ferreira R.B. Antunes L.C. Greenberg E.P. McCarter L.L. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the DGC (but not PDE) activity of BphG1 is light-dependent in R. sphaeroides (15Tarutina M. Ryjenkov D.A. Gomelsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34751-34758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).In L. pneumophila Lens genome, two adjacent genes lpl0329 and lpl0330 encode a putative RR with both GGDEF and EAL domains, and a putative HK, respectively. Here, we demonstrated that Lpl0330 and Lpl0329 form a functional TCS. Actually, the HK Lpl0330 autophosphorylates although it contains none of the four HisKA domains listed in the Pfam data base (17Finn R.D. Mistry J. Tate J. Coggill P. Heger A. Pollington J.E. Gavin O.L. Gunasekaran P. Ceric G. Forslund K. Holm L. Sonnhammer E.L. Eddy S.R. Bateman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: D211-D222Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar). The phosphoacceptor histidine residue in Lpl0330 was identified and was found to be conserved in numerous HKs of various bacterial species, leading us to propose a new HisKA domain. Our results also showed that phosphotransfer from Lpl0330 to Lpl0329 occurs. Moreover, Lpl0329 has been characterized as a RR with two opposite activities: GGDEF and EAL domains of Lpl0329 are both functional in vitro and lead to simultaneous synthesis and hydrolysis of c-di-GMP. Finally, we observed for the first time that DGC activity depends on the phosphorylation state of a DGC/PDE enzyme, suggesting a “molecular switch” that favors one of the two-enzymatic activities and affects the production rate of c-di-GMP.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we highlighted an original mechanism of c-di-GMP biosynthesis regulation by a two-component system-type phosphorylation. Indeed, we have shown that Lpl0329 is a bifunctional enzyme harboring both DGC and PDE activities, which are balanced by aspartate phosphorylation by the atypical HK Lpl0330.Lpl0330 was found to autophosphorylate on a histidine residue in an atypical H box, namely the HGN H box. HisKA domains, which contain the H box with the phosphoryl-accepting His residue, are usually used to predict HK activities. It should be noted that the four HisKA domains currently described do not cover the full diversity of HKs, as some experimentally characterized sensory HKs contain domains that are not recognized by these profiles (4Galperin M.Y. Nikolskaya A.N. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 422: 47-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The atypical HGN H box identified here defines a new histidine kinase subfamily and could be used to annotate new members of this family. Members of this family are retrieved in three phyla of bacteria, namely Verrucomicrobia, Planctomycetes, and Proteobacteria. Especially, 18 of the 24 species that contain the HGN H box can be found in all classes of Proteobacteria phylum (except alpha and zeta Proteobacteria). Most of proteins in this HK subfamily are associated with various sensor modules, such as PAS, PAC (PAS-associated C-terminal domain), GAF (cyclic cGMP-specific and-regulated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, Anabaena adenylyl cyclase, and E. coli transcription factor FhlA), HAMP (HK, adenylyl cyclase, methyl-binding protein-phosphatase domain). Interestingly, seven proteins also contain Ser/Thr kinase catalytic domains (STYKc or S_TKc), which suggests that these proteins participate in hybrid-type signal phosphorelay (Fig. 6). The linkage of the HGN H box with a large variety of modules involved in signal sensing indicates that this HK family would participate in signal transduction pathways to respond to various external or internal signals. Moreover, in silico analysis of genome loci that contain the HK-encoding genes showed that the response regulators genetically linked to this HK subfamily are both transcriptional regulators and enzymatic proteins (data not shown). So, this HK subfamily would be involved in various signal transduction pathways to control different physiological functions.The hypothesis according which the c-di-GMP biosynthesis could be regulated by two component systems has been recently introduced because 8.1% of all GGDEF/EAL proteins harbor a REC domain and thus could be identified as RR of a TCS (9Seshasayee A.S. Fraser G.M. Luscombe N.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 5970-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Moreover, two REC-GGDEF proteins, PleD and WspR, have been shown to be part of a two-component signal transduction pathway, and their functions have been demonstrated to depend directly on their phosphorylation and oligomerization states (34Paul R. Abel S. Wassmann P. Beck A. Heerklotz H. Jenal U. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29170-29177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 35Lai T.H. Kumagai Y. Hyodo M. Hayakawa Y. Rikihisa Y. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 36Wassmann P. Chan C. Paul R. Beck A. Heerklotz H. Jenal U. Schirmer T.

Biol. 2009; 393: 619-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, one REC-EAL protein, VieA, has also been identified (38Martinez-Wilson H.F. Tamayo R. Tischler A.D. Lazinski D.W. Camilli A. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 6439-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, Lpl0329 is only the fourth demonstrated bifunctional DGC/PDE enzyme and the first example of phosphorylation-mediated molecular switch between these two opposite activities. It is noteworthy that 399 proteins harbor a REC domain in addition to the both GGDEF and EAL domains (P2CS data base) (25Barakat M. Ortet P. Jourlin-Castelli C. Ansaldi M. Méjean V. Whitworth D.E. BMC Genomics. 2009; 10: 315Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). According to our results, it is reasonable to anticipate that phosphorylation could participate to control activities of some of these proteins.The HK Lpl0330 contains both heme binding PAS domain and HK domain, thus suggesting an oxygen-regulated signal-transducing system as for FixL/FixJ TCS, which is a paradigm for O2 signal transduction (27Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. Sousa E.H. Tuckerman J. Methods Enzymol. 2008; 437: 173-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It has been shown that excess levels of O2 inhibit FixL autokinase activity but have no effect on phosphoryl transfer from Phospho-FixL to FixJ (39Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16293-16297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Contrary to FixL, in our normoxic conditions, Lpl0330 autophosphorylation seems effective and requires the presence of the PAS domain. However, we failed to detect a large amount of phosphorylated form of Lpl0329 in the presence of Lpl0330 and ATP. In many TCS, dephosphorylation of the P∼RR via the phosphatase activity of the HK limits the level of the activated RR and resets the system (31Russo F.D. Silhavy T.J. Trends Microbiol. 1993; 1: 306-310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 32Kenney L.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2010; 13: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We propose that phosphoryl transfer from P∼Lpl0330 to Lpl0329 Asp-87 effectively occurs and that phosphatase activity of Lpl0330 rapidly hydrolyzes P∼Lpl0329. In this case, it would be interesting to explore whether hypoxic conditions increase P∼Lpl0329 level by enhancing or inhibiting Lpl0330 kinase or phosphatase activities, respectively.Our data demonstrate that Lpl0329 phosphorylation leads to inhibition of the DGC activity (Fig. 7). So, Lpl0330/Lpl0329 proteins constitute an example of a TCS module integrated with a c-di-GMP control module. Regulation of Lpl0329 DGC/PDE activities is consistent with the necessity of a fine tuning of c-di-GMP synthesis and degradation, to ensure signal pathways efficiency, especially because DGC activity operates in vivo close to saturation (5Hengge R. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar) (the cellular concentration of the DGC substrate GTP is in the millimolar range) (40Buckstein M.H. He J. Rubin H. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Similar to HKs, which exhibit both phosphoryl transferase and phosphatase activities to control the rate of P∼RR, bifunctional DGC/PDE enzymes such as Lpl0329 allow control of the signal rate, namely the c-di-GMP concentration, to modulate the associated signal transduction pathway.FIGURE 7Model for TCS Lpl0330/Lpl0329 control of c-di-GMP synthesis. Lpl0329 is a bifunctional DGC/PDE enzyme. Phosphorylation of Lpl0329 by HK Lpl0330 leads to a decrease of DGC activity and thus modulates the local concentration of c-di-GMP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In many RR transcription factors, phosphorylation mediates dimerization of the REC domains, which in turn facilitates DNA binding and transcription activation. A similar mechanism occurs in the two well studied RRs containing GGDEF domains (41Gao R. Stock A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2010; 13: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation promotes PleD dimerization (34Paul R. Abel S. Wassmann P. Beck A. Heerklotz H. Jenal U. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29170-29177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 36Wassmann P. Chan C. Paul R. Beck A. Heerklotz H. Jenal U. Schirmer T.

Biol. 2009; 393: 619-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It should be noted that most GGDEF domains require dimerization to bring together two bound GTP molecules for the synthesis of c-di-GMP (36Wassmann P. Chan C. Paul R. Beck A. Heerklotz H. Jenal U. Schirmer T. Structure. 2007; 15: 915-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 42Schirmer T. Jenal U. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 724-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) whereas dimerization of EAL domains does not seem to be systematically required for PDE activity (43Schmidt A.J. Ryjenkov D.A. Gomelsky M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4774-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). To investigate the impact of phosphorylation on the oligomerization state of Lpl0329, cross-linking and gel filtration assays with Lpl0329 in the presence or not of AcP which mimics the phosphorylated state were carried out (data not shown). A significant part of Lpl0329 homodimerizes in vitro even in the absence of phosphorylation as was described for the NtrC RR subfamily (41Gao R. Stock A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2010; 13: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and therefore it is unlikely that the oligomerization of Lpl0329 is strictly dependent on its phosphorylation. However, the phosphorylated state of the protein could cause structural rearrangement of the oligomers allowing a change in the enzymatic activity. A simple hypothesis would be that the phosphorylation of Lpl0329 leads to a conformational change that affects the proximity between the GTP binding sites of the two subunits of the dimers, without affecting PDE activity of the protein. The x-ray crystal structure of Lpl0329 in the presence of BeF3− to mimic the phosphorylated state, together or not with substrate analogs such as GTPαS, as has been done in the case of PleD (36Wassmann P. Chan C. Paul R. Beck A. Heerklotz H. Jenal U. Schirmer T. Structure. 2007; 15: 915-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), will undoubtedly be necessary to define the subtle domain arrangements in the structure and to validate our current hypothesis.

Microbiol. 2009; 7: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar) and was recently shown to control an original “flagellar brake” mechanism (6Boehm A. Kaiser M. Li H. Spangler C. Kasper C.A.

Cell. 2010; 38: 128-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Proteins involved in the metabolism of c-di-GMP exhibit GGDEF and/or EAL domains responsible for the synthesis and hydrolysis of this secondary metabolite, via their diguanylate cyclase (DGC) and phosphodiesterase (PDE) activities, respectively.The majority of sequenced bacterial genomes encode more than one gene encoding GGDEF/EAL proteins, and they are particularly expanded in gamma proteobacteria with a median of 22 genes/genome (9Seshasayee A.S. Fraser G.M. Luscombe N.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 5970-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This had led to the question on how the activities of these different GGDEF or EAL proteins are regulated. A first level of regulation resides in transcriptional regulation. Most of the 28 GGDEF/EAL domain-encoding genes in Escherichia coli are expressed during entry into stationary phase, with 15 being under sigma S control (10Sommerfeldt N. Possling A. Becker G. Pesavento C. Tschowri N. Hengge R. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 1318-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In Legionella pneumophila, 18 of the 24 GGDEF/EAL domain-encoding genes are up-regulated in transmission phase, the extracellular stationary phase (11Brüggemann H. Hagman A. Jules M. Sismeiro O. Dillies M.A. Gouyette C. Kunst F. Steinert M. Heuner K. Coppée J.Y. Buchrieser C. Cell Microbiol. 2006; 8: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Given that many proteins are expressed under the same condition, their spatial control and post-translational regulation must be also critical as suggested by the variety of sensory domains associated with these proteins, consistent with multiple signal input in an extra-host environment (9Seshasayee A.S. Fraser G.M. Luscombe N.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 5970-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Karatan E. Watnick P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73: 310-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). However, the question remains what determines the overall activity of hybrid proteins that contain both GGDEF and EAL domains and thus present a “biochemical conundrum” (13Ryan R.P. Fouhy Y. Lucey J.F. Dow J.M. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8327-8334Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In many cases, only one of the GGDEF or EAL domain seems to be catalytically active (5Hengge R. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, three proteins showing both activities have been identified, so far raising question on how the two activities are reciprocally regulated: MSDGC-1 in Mycobacterium smegmatis (14Kumar M. Chatterji D. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 2942-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), BphG1 in Rhodobacter sphaeroides (15Tarutina M. Ryjenkov D.A. Gomelsky M. J. Biol.

Microbiology. 2008; 154: 2942-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Tarutina M. Ryjenkov D.A. Gomelsky M. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It was proposed that these proteins could switch between states that are able to synthesize and hydrolyze c-di-GMP (13Ryan R.P. Fouhy Y. Lucey J.F. Dow J.M. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8327-8334Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction between ScrC and two accessory proteins, ScrA and ScrB, influences the balance between DGC and PDE activities of ScrC in V. parahemeolyticus (16Ferreira R.B. Antunes L.C. Greenberg E.P. McCarter L.L. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the DGC (but not PDE) activity of BphG1 is light-dependent in R. sphaeroides (15Tarutina M. Ryjenkov D.A. Gomelsky M. J. Biol.

In this study we investigated the effects and mechanisms of action of a sesquiterpene lactone 6-O-angeloylplenolin (6-OAP) on MM cells.MM cells were exposed to 6-OAP and cell cycle distribution were analyzed. The role for cyclin B1 to play in 6-OAP-caused mitotic arrest was tested by specific siRNA analyses in U266 cells. MM.1S cells co-incubated with interleukin-6 (IL-6), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), or bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were treated with 6-OAP. The effects of 6-OAP plus other drugs on MM.1S cells were evaluated. The in vivo therapeutic efficacy and pharmacokinetic features of 6-OAP were tested in nude mice bearing U266 cells and Sprague-Dawley rats, respectively. We found that 6-OAP suppressed the proliferation of dexamethasone-sensitive and dexamethasone-resistant cell lines and primary CD138+ MM cells. 6-OAP caused mitotic arrest, accompanied by activation of spindle assembly checkpoint and blockage of ubiquitiniation and subsequent proteasomal degradation of cyclin B1. Combined use of 6-OAP and bortezomib induced potentiated cytotoxicity with inactivation of ERK1/2 and activation of JNK1/2 and Casp-8/-3. 6-OAP overcame the protective effects of IL-6 and IGF-I on MM cells through inhibition of Jak2/Stat3 and Akt, respectively. 6-OAP inhibited BMSCs-facilitated MM cell expansion and TNF-α-induced NF-κB signal. Moreover, 6-OAP exhibited potent anti-MM activity in nude mice and favorable pharmacokinetics in rats.These results indicate that 6-OAP is a new cell cycle inhibitor which shows therapeutic potentials for MM."

Mass spectrometry determined that all the additional candidate 3Hyp substrate sites in the pN type II collagen made by these cells were highly hydroxylated.

https://openalex.org/W1992161401,"The EF1143 protein from Enterococcus faecalis is a distant homolog of deoxynucleotide triphosphate triphosphohydrolases (dNTPases) from Escherichia coli and Thermus thermophilus. These dNTPases are important components in the regulation of the dNTP pool in bacteria. Biochemical assays of the EF1143 dNTPase activity demonstrated nonspecific hydrolysis of all canonical dNTPs in the presence of Mn(2+). In contrast, with Mg(2+) hydrolysis required the presence of dGTP as an effector, activating the degradation of dATP and dCTP with dGTP also being consumed in the reaction with dATP. The crystal structure of EF1143 and dynamic light scattering measurements in solution revealed a tetrameric oligomer as the most probable biologically active unit. The tetramer contains four dGTP specific allosteric regulatory sites and four active sites. Examination of the active site with the dATP substrate suggests an in-line nucleophilic attack on the α-phosphate center as a possible mechanism of the hydrolysis and two highly conserved residues, His-129 and Glu-122, as an acid-base catalytic dyad. Structural differences between EF1143 apo and holo forms revealed mobility of the α3 helix that can regulate the size of the active site binding pocket and could be stabilized in the open conformation upon formation of the tetramer and dGTP effector binding."
https://openalex.org/W1984882340,"Addition of man-made structures alters abiotic and biotic characteristics of natural habitats, which can influence abundances of biota directly and/or indirectly, by altering the ecology of competitors or predators. Marine epibiota in modified habitats were used to test hypotheses to distinguish between direct and indirect processes. In Sydney Harbour, kelps on pier-pilings supported greater covers of bryozoans, particularly of the non-indigenous species Membranipora membranacea, than found on natural reefs. Pilings influenced these patterns and processes directly due to the provision of shade and indirectly by altering abundances of sea-urchins which, in turn, affected covers of bryozoans. Indirect effects were more important than direct effects. This indicates that artificial structures affect organisms living on secondary substrata in complex ways, altering the biodiversity and indirectly affecting abundances of epibiota. Understanding how these components of habitats affect ecological processes is necessary to allow sensible prediction of the effects of modifying habitats on the ecology of organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1989162362,"The study of the interrelationship between productivity and biodiversity is a major research field in ecology. Theory predicts that if essential resources are heterogeneously distributed across a metacommunity, single species may dominate productivity in individual metacommunity patches, but a mixture of species will maximize productivity across the whole metacommunity. It also predicts that a balanced supply of resources within local patches should favor species coexistence, whereas resource imbalance would favor the dominance of one species. We performed an experiment with five freshwater algal species to study the effects of total supply of resources, their ratios, and species richness on biovolume production and evenness at the scale of both local patches and metacommunities. Generally, algal biovolume increased, whereas algal resource use efficiency (RUE) and evenness decreased with increasing total supply of resources in mixed communities containing all five species. In contrast to predictions for biovolume production, the species mixtures did not outperform all monocultures at the scale of metacommunities. In other words, we observed no general transgressive overyielding. However, RUE was always higher in mixtures than predicted from monocultures, and analyses indicate that resource partitioning or facilitation in mixtures resulted in higher-than-expected productivity at high resource supply. Contrasting our predictions for the local scale, balanced supply of resources did not generally favor higher local evenness, however lowest evenness was confined to patches with the most imbalanced supply. Thus, our study provides mixed support for recent theoretical advancements to understand biodiversity-productivity relationships."

https://openalex.org/W1990178542,"Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is secreted by a non-classical pathway into the extracellular space, where it has several activities pertinent to fibronectin (FN), including binding to the gelatin-binding domain of FN and acting as an integrin co-receptor. Glutamines in the N-terminal tail of FN are known to be susceptible to transamidation by both TG2 and activated blood coagulation factor XIII (FXIIIa). We used immunoblotting, limited proteolysis, and mass spectrometry to localize glutamines within FN that are subject to TG2-catalyzed incorporation of dansylcadaverine in comparison to residues modified by FXIIIa. Such analysis of plasma FN indicated that Gln-3, Gln-7, and Gln-9 in the N-terminal tail and Gln-246 of the linker between fifth and sixth type I modules ((5)F1 and (6)F1) are transamidated by both enzymes. Only minor incorporation of dansylcadaverine was detected elsewhere. Labeling of C-terminally truncated FN constructs revealed efficient TG2- or FXIIIa-catalyzed dansylcadaverine incorporation into the N-terminal residues of constructs as small as the 29-kDa fragment that includes (1-5)F1 and lacks modules from the adjacent gelatin-binding domain. However, when only (1-3)F1 were present, dansylcadaverine incorporation into the N-terminal residues of FN was lost and instead was in the enzymes, near the active site of TG2 and terminal domains of FXIIIa. Thus, these results demonstrate that FXIIIa and TG2 act similarly on glutamines at either end of (1-5)F1 and transamidation specificity of both enzymes is achieved through interactions with the intact 29K fragment."

Here, we identify a novel intronic CREM promoter (denoted P2) in front of the second exon of the CREM gene that harbors putative binding sites for TATA-binding proteins and the transcriptional activator AP-1. DNA binding studies, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and reporter assays confirmed the functional relevance of these sites, and T cell activation through CD3/CD28 stimulation or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin treatment enhances P2 promoter activity. Although the basal CREM levels are increased in T cells from SLE patients compared with healthy controls, there are remarkable differences in the regulation of CREM expression in response to T cell activation. Whereas T cells from healthy individuals display increased CREM expression after T cell activation, most likely through AP-1-dependent up-regulation of the P2 promoter, SLE T cells fail to further increase their basal CREM levels upon T cell activation due to a decreased content of the AP-1 family member c-Fos.

The cAMP-mediated signaling cascade is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that comprises stimulus-dependent cAMP production, cAMP binding to the regulatory subunits of protein kinases, nuclear translocation of the regulatory units of these kinases, and phosphorylation of the CRE-binding protein/CREM/activating transcription factors. All CREM proteins are characterized by basic domain/leucine zipper motifs; however, the multiexonic character of the CREM gene, the usage of an inducible intronic promoter or alternative initiation codons, and differential splicing mechanisms account for the presence of multiple CREM isoforms that are expressed in a cell- and development-specific fashion (4Delmas V. Laoide B.M. Masquilier D. de Groot R.P. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 4226-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 5Foulkes N.S. Duval G.

Based on the specific exon composition, CREM exerts trans-activating or trans-repressive effects on target gene expression by direct binding to CREs (TGACGTCA) or the CRE 5′-half-site in cis-regulatory regions (6Sassone-Corsi P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 355-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). CREs are highly conserved within numerous promoters of eukaryotic genes. The α-isoform of CREM has been linked to decreased production of IL-2 in T cells, which was referred to as anergy (7Powell J.D. Lerner C.G. Ewoldt G.R. Schwartz R.H. J.

Rheumatol. 2000; 12: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Inversely, transfection of antisense CREMα plasmids into SLE T cells restores IL-2 production, which ensues the ability to activate a promoter by elimination of a transcriptional repressor (9Tenbrock K.

However, data describing how the CREM gene itself is regulated are scarce. The functional characterization of CREM promoters, as well as identification of factors that regulate their activity, is needed to understand the regulation of CREM expression in human T cells with particular relevance to SLE pathogenesis.

Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (8924) Google Scholar) and were recruited from the Division of Rheumatology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Healthy individuals were chosen as controls. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all participating subjects. Peripheral venous blood was collected in heparin/lithium tubes, and total human T cells were purified as described previously (17Juang Y.T. Rauen T. Wang Y. Ichinose K. Benedyk K. Tenbrock K. Tsokos G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1795-1801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Chemically competent Escherichia coli strain TOP10F (Invitrogen) was used for plasmid amplification, mutagenesis, and cloning experiments. Reporter studies were performed in primary human T cells or in a human T cell line (Jurkat clone E6-1). All cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% l-glutamine, and 10% penicillin/streptomycin. Expression vectors for c-fos and c-jun (both in pcDNA3.1) were kindly provided by R. Tijan (Department of Biochemistry, University of California, Berkeley, CA), and pcDNA3.1-SP-1 was a gift of Marcin Chłystun (Institute of Medical Biochemistry, University of Münster). The CREM P2 promoter and truncated portions thereof were amplified by PCR using the RP11–134A8 human genomic clone (Sanger) as a template and primers linked to restriction sites for KpnI (forward primers) and NheI (reverse primers) as listed in Table 1. PCR products were purified, digested with the appropriate enzymes, and ligated into precut pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). The final plasmids were sequence-verified (SeqLab, Gottingen, Germany). All plasmid DNA preparations were carried out with DNA purification kits (Genomed and Qiagen). The quantity and quality of plasmid DNA were determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm in a GeneQuant II RNA/DNA calculator spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare). Site-directed mutagenesis of specific protein-binding sites within the reporter constructs was performed using complementary sense and antisense DNA oligonucleotides (Eurofins MWG Operon) and PfuTurbo® DNA polymerase (Stratagene) according to the manufacturers' instructions.

Each reporter experiment included 10 ng of Renilla luciferase construct as an internal control. Five hours after transfection, cells were collected and lysed, and luciferase activity was quantified using the Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase experiments were repeated at least three times, and values in the bar graphs are given as means ± S.E. Polyethylenimine (Sigma) was used to perform transfection experiments in Jurkat cells (19Crispín J.C. Tsokos G.C. Autoimmun. Rev. 2009; 8: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We used 5 μl of 0.1% polyethylenimine and 4 μg of plasmid DNA per 0.75–1 × 106 cells. Cells were kept in a polyethylenimine/DNA mixture for a total of 16–18 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FCS only. Subsequently, the medium was replaced with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS, and cells were maintained in this medium in the presence or absence of either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 μg/ml) or plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (each at 2 μg/ml; BD Biosciences) for 24 h. Cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured as described above. Effector/reporter transfection experiments were performed at a molar ratio of 3:1. Primary human T cells (3 × 106) were cultured in the presence or absence of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (each at 2 μg/ml) for 5 h. Subsequently, total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Residual genomic DNA contamination was removed by DNase I (Qiagen). PCR primer sequences were as follows: CREM, 5′-tcgcgaacttgggacga-3′ (forward) and 5′-ctctacgtttatgagaatcaattacac-3′ (reverse); IL-2, 5′-cactactcacagtaacctcaactcctg-3′ (forward) and 5′-gtgggaagcacttaattatcaagtcagtgt-3′ (reverse); and 18 S rRNA, 5′-actcaacacgggaaacctca-3′ (forward) and 5′-aaccagacaaatcgctccac-3′ (reverse). PCR products were visualized on 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. To determine transcription start sites, we performed RACE using a GeneRacerTM kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This technique provides a method to obtain full-length 5′-ends of cDNA using known cDNA sequences from expressed sequence tags, subtracted cDNA, differential display, or library screening and ensures the amplification of full-length transcripts only by elimination of truncated messages from the amplification process. It results in selective ligation of an RNA oligonucleotide to the 5′-ends of decapped mRNA using T4 RNA ligase. For RACE experiments, total RNA from Jurkat cells was isolated using the RNeasy kit. Nucleoprotein lysates were prepared from total T cells from healthy blood donors as described previously (17Juang Y.T. Rauen T. Wang Y. Ichinose K. Benedyk K. Tenbrock K. Tsokos G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1795-1801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A double-stranded DNA probe harboring the AP-1 site (−264/−258; 5′-gtaagattgacaaaaaaccgtacag-3′) within the CREM P2 promoter was radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 20 min in Hi-Density Tris borate/EDTA binding buffer (Invitrogen) containing 5 μg of nuclear protein from primary human T cells obtained from healthy blood donors and 1 μg of poly(dI)-poly(dC) in a total volume of 20 μl. Electrophoresis and autoradiography were performed as described previously (17Juang Y.T. Rauen T. Wang Y. Ichinose K. Benedyk K. Tenbrock K. Tsokos G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1795-1801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For supershift assays, 2 μg of anti-c-Fos monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the binding reaction. 50- and 100-fold molar excesses of unlabeled oligonucleotide and an unrelated competitor (5′-agagccgagaccacgccactgcagtttagcttggacagag-3′) were used for competition assays. Primary human T cells were cultivated in the presence or absence of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (each at 2 μg/ml) for 5 h. Subsequently, cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, lysed, and sonicated. ChIP analysis was performed using a ChIP assay kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions at 2 × 106 cells/immunoprecipitating antibody. The DNA-protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with either anti-c-Fos polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or an isotype-matched control antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), subjected to a series of washing steps, and reverse-cross-linked, and the protein was digested with proteinase K (Qiagen). DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen). Immunoprecipitated and purified DNA was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR using the following primers, detecting the relevant sequence of the CREM P2 promoter: 5′-gatagcactgctttctcttc-3′ (forward) and 5′-gggagatcgtaacatttcac-3′ (reverse). The corresponding input DNA (20%) was analyzed by the same method, and immunoprecipitated DNA was calculated as percentage of input DNA. Student's paired two-tailed t test was used for statistical analysis. Data were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05 and p < 0.01. To analyze T cell activation-dependent regulation of CREMα expression, we stimulated total T cells obtained from SLE patients and healthy individuals with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies for 5 h and analyzed CREMα expression at the messenger level using primers targeting the CREMα N terminus (Fig. 1A). Of note, activation led to a decreased amount of CREMα mRNA in SLE T cells, whereas it was increased in control T cells. We also analyzed IL-2 mRNA from these samples and found elevated levels in both healthy and SLE T cells upon activation. However, in line with previous data, IL-2 levels displayed a far lower increase in activated SLE T cells compared with activated T cells from healthy donors. Most likely, the ultimate IL-2 production following T cell activation may not be directed by CREMα alone, but rather by a complex interplay between multiple activation-induced transcription factors that mediate IL-2 transcription (e.g. NF-AT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) and NF-κB (19Crispín J.C. Tsokos G.C. Autoimmun. Rev. 2009; 8: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, CD28 co-stimulation is known to contribute to increased IL-2 mRNA stability (20Ragheb J.A. Deen M. Schwartz R.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 120-129PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the ultimate IL-2 expression results may not be explained by CREMα-mediated effects alone. Genomatix analysis of the CREM promoter that we published previously did not define any binding sites for major transcription factors that are activated by CD3/CD28 stimulation, such as AP-1 or NF-AT. This led us to predict the presence of a yet unknown promoter region that mediates differential CREMα expression in SLE and normal T cells following TCR activation. We used two different approaches to identify putative promoter regions within the human CREM gene on chromosome 10. First, we screened 30,000 bp upstream of the previously published start codon of the CREM gene using ElDorado Gene2Promoter software (Genomatix) (21Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5619) Google Scholar). This tagged two putative promoters (Fig. 1B) located 21 kb (denoted P1, in front of exon I) and 10 kb (denoted P2, in front of exon II) upstream of the start codon. Whereas P1 corresponds to the SP-1-dependent CREM promoter that we characterized previously (17Juang Y.T. Rauen T. Wang Y. Ichinose K. Benedyk K. Tenbrock K. Tsokos G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1795-1801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), P2 has not been described yet. However, a MEDLINE search revealed that the 3′-ends of both promoters have been already identified as transcription initiation sites in different cell systems without any further characterization (22Fujimoto T. Fujisawa J. Yoshida M. J. Biochem. 1994; 115: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Second, we performed RACE analysis using RNA from stimulated human T cells to identify transcription initiation sites within the CREM gene. This technique confirmed the transcription initiation site located 21 kb upstream of the start codon (Fig. 1B). Although RACE analysis did not affirm the transcription initiation site located 10 kb upstream of the start codon, cDNA analysis of human T cells with selective primers for exon II showed that this part is actively transcribed and induced after stimulation (data not shown). We constructed luciferase reporter plasmids of the P2 promoter and truncated forms thereof to analyze their responsiveness to T cell activation and to decipher the underlying transcriptional machinery. Reporter constructs of the CREM P2 promoter were transfected into Jurkat cells and tested for their promoter activities at the basal level or after anti-CD3/CD28 antibody or PMA/ionomycin stimulation for 24 h (Fig. 2). In line with other promoter identification studies, P2 promoter plasmids displayed variable activity levels depending on their size, which supports the existence of multiple transcriptional activators and repressors that mediate the ultimate promoter activity. Whereas the reporter construct spanning the proximal 200 bp of the P2 promoter did not display enhanced promoter activity upon CD3/CD28 or PMA/ionomycin stimulation, these stimulations led to a robust 2–3-fold increase in the reporters containing longer portions of the P2 promoter (500, 800, and 1193 bp, respectively). Of note, T cell activation showed a less pronounced effect on the P1 promoter (data not shown). In contrast to P1, the P2 promoter contains two TATA boxes, which both appear to be necessary for full promoter activity because site-directed mutagenesis of either one decreased both basal and stimulation-induced promoter activities (Fig. 3A). To unravel the activation-induced increase in P2 promoter activity, we screened for cis-regulatory elements within the proximal 500 bp of P2 and were able to map a putative AP-1-binding site located between 264 and 258 bp upstream of the start codon (Fig. 1C), which shows high homology to AP-1-binding sites within other promoters, such as matrix metalloproteinase-9 and IL-6 (23Jung S.H.

Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1466-1477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Co-transfection experiments with AP-1 proteins c-Fos and c-Jun enhanced promoter activity by 2–4-fold depending on the promoter length (Fig. 3B). Mutation of this AP-1 site (−268/−258) resulted in decreased P2 activity at the basal level as well as upon T cell activation with PMA and ionomycin to enhance promoter activity (Fig. 3C). DNA binding studies using nucleoprotein lysates obtained from Jurkat cells and a double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning this site confirmed AP-1 binding to this site. Both supershift assays with anti-Fos monoclonal antibody and competition assays that included the unlabeled oligonucleotide at a 50- or 100-fold molar excess significantly decreased the band intensity of a specific DNA-protein complex (Fig. 3, D and E). ChIP analyses in primary human T cells that were cultivated in the presence or absence of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies confirmed significantly increased in vivo c-Fos binding to the AP-1 site (−264/−258) within the P2 promoter following T cell activation (36.11 ± 10.66 versus 3.18 ± 0.22 in unstimulated cells; p = 0.025) (Fig. 3F).FIGURE 3P2 promoter is regulated through TATA boxes and AP-1 activity. A, site-directed mutagenesis of both of the putative TATA sites within the P2 promoter was performed, and non-mutated as well as mutated constructs were transfected into Jurkat T cells to analyze promoter activity at the basal level (white bars) and following stimulation with PMA/ionomycin (Iono; black bars). The experiment was repeated five times, and values are given as means ± S.D. B, P2 reporter constructs were co-transfected with either c-fos/c-jun expression plasmids (black bars) or an empty vector (white bars), and luciferase activity was measured. The experiment was repeated five times, and values are given as means ± S.D. C, the AP-1 site (−264/−258) within the P2 promoter was mutated (mAP-1), and the promoter activities of the wild-type promoter and the mutant were analyzed in the absence (white bars) and presence (black bars) of PMA/ionomycin for 24 h. The experiment was repeated five times, and values are given as means ± S.D. D, EMSA was performed using a radiolabeled oligonucleotide harboring the AP-1 site (−264/−258), nucleoprotein from primary human T cells, and anti-c-Fos antibody. E, competition assays were performed using either the unlabeled probe or an unrelated oligonucleotide (without any AP-1 sites) at a 50- or 100-fold molar excess, respectively. F, primary human T cells were cultured in the presence or absence of CD3/CD28 stimulation for 5 h. Sonicated cell lysates were incubated with either anti-c-Fos antibody or control IgG. Immunoprecipitated DNA and non-immunoprecipitated input DNA (20% of immunoprecipitated DNA) were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR using primers covering the AP-1 site (−264/−258) within the P2 promoter. The bar diagram shows the anti-c-Fos-immunoprecipitated DNA/input DNA ratios normalized to the background control IgG immunoprecipitate.

Juang Y.T. Tenbrock K. Weinstein A. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3557-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because the activity of the CREM P2 promoter is regulated by AP-1, an autoregulatory feedback mechanism between AP-1 and CREM is very likely and may explain the differences in the responsiveness of SLE and normal T cells to transcribe the CREM gene following T cell activation. We therefore transfected P2 promoter constructs P2-300, P2-500, and P2-800 (all of them harboring the AP-1 site (−264/−258) that we characterized beforehand) into primary T cells obtained from SLE patients and healthy controls (Fig. 4). Whereas SLE T cells did not show any enhanced basal P2 promoter activity (relative to the empty pGL3 vector), the promoter activity in normal T cells increased by 1.7- and 2.2-fold. The fact that the difference between SLE and normal T cells in terms of P2 promoter activity reaches statistical significance suggests the existence of yet another transcriptional aberration in SLE T cells (Fig. 5). Of note, P2 activity in SLE and healthy T cells displays an “opposite behavior” compared with P1 activity, which is consistently higher in SLE T cells and even mirrors SLE disease activity (17Juang Y.T.

Chem. 2011; 286: 1795-1801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).FIGURE 5Model of transcriptional regulation of the CREM gene in normal and SLE T cells. The AP-1 protein complex (c-Fos/c-Jun) serves as a key transcriptional mediator in activation-induced CREM expression through its P2 promoter in T cells from healthy individuals (left). In SLE T cells, increased activity of PP2A accounts for SP-1 dephosphorylation and activation, and activated SP-1 up-regulates CREM P1 promoter activity (right). Because CREMα trans-represses c-fos expression in SLE T cells, P2 promoter activity fails to become up-regulated upon T cell activation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We reported previously that, in SLE T cells, the overexpressed PP2A dephosphorylates SP-1, which drives increased expression of CREM through the CREM P1 promoter (17Juang Y.T. Rauen T. Wang Y. Ichinose K. Benedyk K. Tenbrock K. Tsokos G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1795-1801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this study, we have presented evidence of the presence of yet another CREM promoter (P2) located upstream of exon II that accounts for the increased expression of CREM in normal T cells following activation. Specifically, the P2 promoter (i) is regulated independently by a different subset of transcription factors compared with P1, (ii) is responsive to T cell activation by either CD3/CD28 or PMA/ionomycin stimulation, and (iii) displays significantly decreased activity in T cells from SLE patients. Whereas P1 is a TATA-less promoter, P2 contains two well defined TATA boxes and an AP-1 site, all of which are functional and contribute to activation-induced CREMα expression in normal T cells. SLE T cells express increased levels of the transcriptional repressor CREMα, which is known to interact with the proximal promoter of the AP-1 family member c-Fos and to repress c-fos transcription. Previous data from our group substantiate that T cell activation leads to significantly decreased c-Fos levels in SLE cells compared with activated T cells from healthy individuals at both the mRNA and protein levels; furthermore, post-stimulation c-fos mRNA amounts correlate inversely to SLE disease activity (13Kyttaris V.C. Juang Y.T. Tenbrock K. Weinstein A. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3557-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Altogether, these findings point to an autoregulatory loop between CREMα and AP-1 activities that accounts for the aberrant activation-induced CREMα expression in SLE T cells. Whereas AP-1 regulates P2 activity, P1 does not define any AP-1 consensus sites, and forced c-fos/c-jun expression did not affect P1 promoter activity (data not shown). Conversely, there are no putative SP-1 sites present in P2, which points to the fact that both promoters act independently as they require different transcriptional regulators that are induced under various physiologic and/or pathologic conditions. TCR engagement initiates a signaling cascade that comprises phosphorylation of the TCR/CD3 ζ-chain, activation of ZAP-70 (zeta-chain-associated protein 70), increases in the intracellular calcium levels, and activation of cytoplasmic protein kinases, such as PKC, calcineurin, JNKs, and MAPK/ERK kinases (1Tenbrock K. Tsokos G.C. Int. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 23: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Eventually, these kinases catalyze phosphorylation of effector proteins, e.g. transcription factors NF-AT, AP-1, and NF-κB. The AP-1 family member c-Jun is phosphorylated and thereby activated through PKC and JNK (28Lacroix I. Lipcey C. Imbert J. Kahn-Perlès B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9598-9605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Upon activation, c-Jun enters the nucleus and forms homo- or heterodimers with newly transcribed and produced c-Fos proteins (26Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A. Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). These protein complexes are known to interact with AP-1 sites within cis-regulatory gene regions with even increased binding affinity if the AP-1 complex cooperates with other transcription factors like NF-AT (25Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 26Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A.

Both c-Fos and c-Jun are potent trans-activators, and their binding to the IL-2 promoter is an essential prerequisite for IL-2 transcription. In contrast, the transcription factor SP-1 needs to be dephosphorylated, e.g. through PP2A, to exert its transcriptional activity (17Juang Y.T. Rauen T. Wang Y. Ichinose K. Benedyk K. Tenbrock K. Tsokos G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1795-1801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Lacroix I. Lipcey C. Imbert J. Kahn-Perlès B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9598-9605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation at SP-1 serine 59 is critical for CREM P1 promoter activity in SLE T cells. Expression of both IL-2 and the IL-2 receptor gene has been shown to be regulated by an interplay between AP-1 and SP-1 that eventually mediates cell cycle progression and T cell proliferation (24Grassl C. Luckow B. Schlöndorff D. Dendorfer U. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1466-1477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Jain J. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1240-1250PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have provided evidence that also the human CREM gene comprises cis-regulatory targets for these two transcription factors. So far, CREM activation and its functional propensities to act as a suppressor or activator of gene transcription have been explained mainly by post-transcriptional mechanisms, such as alternative splicing and protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, e.g. through PKA, PKC, MAPKs, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases IV and II (6Sassone-Corsi P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 355-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 10Juang Y.T. Wang Y. Solomou E.E. Li Y. Mawrin C. Tenbrock K. Kyttaris V.C. Tsokos G.C. J. Clin.

Until now, four functional promoters have been characterized that regulate expression of different truncated CREM isoforms at the transcriptional level: the P1 promoter, which drives the constitutive activation of CREMα; a promoter that regulates expression of the short inducible CRE repressor variant of CREM; and two more (termed P3 and P4) that account for increased expression of activating CREM isoforms in spermatocytes (32Daniel P.B. Rohrbach L. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3923-3930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inducible CRE repressor isoform contains only the DNA-binding domain, is rapidly up-regulated after T cell activation, and suppresses IL-2 transcription (33Bodor J. Feigenbaum L. Bodorova J. Bare C. Reitz Jr., M.S. Gress R.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 1053-1059PubMed Google Scholar). However, the production and transcriptional activities of CREMα, which is the most abundant full-length CREM isoform in T cells, contribute to a sustained and prolonged IL-2 down-regulation in SLE T cells. Both CREM P1 and P2 promoters regulate transcription and expression of the full-length CREM isoforms, and our findings do not clarify whether one of the two determines transcription of specific CREM isoforms. However, the particular characteristics of these promoters, as well as the different expression and activity levels of AP-1 and SP-1, contribute to the differential “behavior” of P1 and P2 in SLE and normal T cells. Because CREMα controls the expression of multiple genes that orchestrate the immune response, including IL-2 and c-fos/AP-1, the identification and functional characterization of the CREM P1 and P2 promoters advance our understanding of the regulation of CREM expression in health and disease. Although, in normal T cells, CREMα expression increases only after stimulation, in time to curb IL-2 production, and limits the length of the response, in SLE T cells, CREMα expression is increased prior to in vitro stimulation and contributes to suppressed IL-2 production. It is possible that the recorded increase in CREMα expression in normal T cells represents an in vivo stimulation of T cells by autoantigens and/or circulating anti-CD3/TCR antibodies. The increased expression of CREMα contributes to the suppression of c-fos/AP-1, a transcriptional activator of several immune response genes, such as IL-2 and IL-6. The data presented in this study clearly reveal the complex mechanisms that control the expression of CREMα and its target genes. It appears that the increased basal CREMα expression in SLE T cells and its subsequent failure to increase after stimulation result in an apparent immune dysregulation. If CREMα expression were to be “silenced” in SLE T cells, it would permit normal expression of IL-2 and c-fos/AP-1 and timely termination of the (auto)immune response.

https://openalex.org/W2016358676,"Background Federal guidelines now recommend supplemental HIV RNA testing for persons at high risk for acute HIV infection. However, many rapid HIV testing sites do not include HIV RNA or p24 antigen testing due to concerns about cost, the need for results follow-up, and the impact of expanded venipuncture on clinic flow. We developed criteria to identify patients in a municipal STD clinic in San Francisco who are asymptomatic but may still be likely to have acute infection. Methods Data were from patients tested with serial HIV antibody and HIV RNA tests to identify acute HIV infection. BED-CEIA results were used to classify non-acute cases as recent or longstanding. Demographics and self-reported risk behaviors were collected at time of testing. Multivariate models were developed and preliminarily evaluated using predictors associated with recent infection in bivariate analyses as a proxy for acute HIV infection. Multivariate models demonstrating ≥70% sensitivity for recent infection while testing ≤60% of patients in this development dataset were then validated by determining their performance in identifying acute infections. Results From 2004–2007, 137 of 12,622 testers had recent and 36 had acute infections. A model limiting acute HIV screening to MSM plus any one of a series of other predictors resulted in a sensitivity of 83.3% and only 47.6% of patients requiring testing. A single-factor model testing only patients reporting any receptive anal intercourse resulted in 88.9% sensitivity with only 55.2% of patients requiring testing. Conclusions In similar high risk HIV testing sites, acute screening using “supplemental” HIV p24 antigen or RNA tests can be rationally targeted to testers who report particular HIV risk behaviors. By improving the efficiency of acute HIV testing, such criteria could facilitate expanded acute case identification."

Carboxyl-terminally His-FLAG-tagged human P2X1 receptors were stably expressed in HEK293 cells and co-purified with cytoskeletal proteins including actin. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D inhibited P2X1 receptor currents with no effect on the time course of the response or surface expression of the receptor. Stabilization of the cytoskeleton with jasplakinolide had no effect on P2X1 receptor currents but decreased receptor mobility. P2X2 receptor currents were unaffected by cytochalasin, and P2X1/2 receptor chimeras were used to identify the molecular basis of actin sensitivity. These studies showed that the intracellular amino terminus accounts for the inhibitory effects of cytoskeletal disruption similar to that shown for lipid raft/cholesterol sensitivity. Stabilization of the cytoskeleton with jasplakinolide abolished the inhibitory effects of cholesterol depletion on P2X1 receptor currents, suggesting that lipid rafts may regulate the receptor through stabilization of the cytoskeleton. These studies show that the cytoskeleton plays an important role in P2X1 receptor regulation. P2X1 receptors are ATP-gated ion channels expressed by smooth muscle and blood cells.

These studies show that the cytoskeleton plays an important role in P2X1 receptor regulation. P2X1 receptors for ATP are ligand-gated cation channels formed from the trimeric assembly of subunits with two transmembrane regions, intracellular amino and carboxyl termini and a large extracellular ligand binding loop (1Valera S.

In smooth muscle they contribute to sympathetic nerve-mediated contraction of arteries (3Vial C. Evans R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), vas deferens (4Mulryan K. Gitterman D.P. Lewis C.J. Vial C. Leckie B.J. Cobb A.L. Brown J.E. Conley E.C. Buell G.

Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In the circulatory system P2X1 receptors have been shown to have a role in platelet activation (6Gachet C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46: 277-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and the subtype selective antagonist NF449 has a protective role in thromboembolism models (7Hechler B. Magnenat S.

The receptors are also expressed on mast cells (8Wareham K. Vial C. Wykes R.C. Bradding P. Seward E.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 157: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), macrophages (9Sim J.A. Park C.K. Oh S.B. Evans R.J. North R.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 152: 1283-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), neutrophils (where they are involved in migration) (10Lecut C. Frederix K. Johnson D.M. Deroanne C. Thiry M. Faccinetto C. Marée R. Evans R.J. Volders P.G. Bours V. Oury C. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 2801-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and T cells where they redistribute to the immune synapse on activation (11Woehrle T. Yip L. Elkhal A. Sumi Y. Chen Y. Yao Y. Insel P.A. Junger W.G. Blood. 2010; 116: 3475-3484Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Regulation of P2X1 receptor responsiveness may therefore play an important role in the fine tuning of blood flow and immune responses. P2X1 receptor channels show rapid desensitization during continued agonist application with the current decaying monoexponentially with a time constant of ∼250 ms (12Surprenant A. North R.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2009; 71: 333-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 13Lalo U. Allsopp R.C. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Evans R.J. J. Neurochem. 2010; 113: 1177-1187PubMed Google Scholar). In the whole cell recording mode P2X1 receptor currents do not fully recover from desensitization and decrease in amplitude on repeated application, a phenomenon referred to as run down (14Lewis C.J. Evans R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 1659-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the perforated patch recording configuration (that maintains the integrity of intracellular signaling pathways) reproducible P2X1 receptor currents are recorded when a 5-min washout period is given between agonist applications (13Lalo U. Allsopp R.C. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Evans R.J. J. Neurochem. 2010; 113: 1177-1187PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lewis C.J. Evans R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 1659-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This suggests that intracellular factors that are dialyzed out of the cell during whole cell recording contribute to regulation of the receptor. Further evidence that P2X1 receptors can be regulated by intracellular factors comes from studies showing that P2X1 receptor currents are potentiated following activation of protein kinase C (15Vial C. Tobin A.B. Evans R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 16Ase A.R. Raouf R. Bélanger D. Hamel E. Séguéla P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 315: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the potentiation of responses is not thought to result from direct phosphorylation of the receptor but of an interacting protein that has a regulatory role (15Vial C. Tobin A.B. Evans R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts provide a mechanism for bringing together receptors and signaling molecules (17Allen J.A. Halverson-Tamboli R.A. Rasenick M.M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 128-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). P2X1 receptors are localized to lipid rafts in smooth muscle, platelets as well as in recombinant systems, and cholesterol depletion that disrupts the rafts inhibits P2X1 receptor responses (18Allsopp R.C. Lalo U. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 32770-32777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Vial C. Evans R.J. J. Biol.

Commun. 2006; 343: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations indicate that the P2X1 receptor can be regulated by intracellular signaling pathways and interacting proteins that may be localized together in lipid rafts. Proteomic studies have identified interacting proteins for other P2X receptors with a focus on P2X2 and P2X7 receptors (21Masin M. Kerschensteiner D. Dümke K. Rubio M.E. Soto F. J. Biol.

In this study we have expressed an epitope-tagged P2X1 receptor in HEK293 cells, isolated the receptor, and identified associated proteins, including actin, by mass spectroscopy. In functional studies disruption of the actin cytoskeleton inhibited P2X1-, but not P2X2-receptor mediated responses, and chimeric P2X1/2 receptors showed that the intracellular amino terminus was involved. This was similar to that observed for the inhibition of the P2X1 receptor following cholesterol depletion, and we have now shown a link between the cytoskeleton and lipid rafts in receptor regulation. Human P2X1 receptors with a carboxyl-terminal His-FLAG tag were isolated utilizing an anti-FLAG® M2 affinity agarose gel column (Sigma). Starting material of 5- ×175-cm2 flasks of either native HEK293 or HEK293 stably expressing human P2X1 His-FLAG were lysed using buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 8 mm Tris, 750 mm aminocaproic acid, 1% n-octyl glucoside, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 15 min) and supernatant rolled overnight with 2 ml of anti-FLAG® M2 affinity agarose gel. The agarose beads were placed in a column and flow-through collected. Beads were washed four times with 50 ml of TBS and a sample collected at each wash stage. Proteins were eluted with 1 ml aliquots of 0.1 mg/ml 3× FLAG peptide followed by two 1-ml aliquots of 0.1 m glycine (pH 3.5). Samples of fractions (10 μl) collected from each step were Western blotted with anti-P2X1 antibody (Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel) at 1:1000 dilution (as used previously) and positive fractions pooled and concentrated using Amicon Ultra 4 30,000 MWCO centrifugal filters (Millipore). To discover proteins with weak interactions to P2X1, some cells were treated prior to lysis with the cell-permeable cross-linking agent dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP, 2The abbreviations used are: DSPdithiobis(succinimidyl propionate)EGFPenhanced GFPFRAPfluorescent recovery after photobleachingMβ-CDmethyl-β-cyclodextrinpA/pFpicoamperes per picofaradα,β-meATPα,β-methylene ATP. 100 μm in PBS) applied to the cells for 30 min and the cross-linking reaction stopped by addition of 1 m Tris. Purified His-FLAG-tagged human P2X1 receptor and associated proteins were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained using InstantBlue (Expedeon, Harston, UK). The stained bands were excised, trypsin-digested, and analyzed using mass spectrometry. LC-tandem MS analysis was carried out using either 4000 Q-Trap system or Thermo Orbitrap (Protein Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory, University of Leicester, UK). Postrun tandem MS ion searches were carried out on Mascot (Matrix Science), and multiple protein analysis carried out with Scaffold2 (Proteome Software Inc.). Proteins were positively identified by a minimum of three peptides with >95% peptide identification probability giving an overall protein identification probability of >99%. dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) enhanced GFP fluorescent recovery after photobleaching methyl-β-cyclodextrin picoamperes per picofarad α,β-methylene ATP. Native HEK293 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts (with GlutaMAXTM I; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. A monolayer of native cells at 80–90% confluence in a 24-well culture dish was transiently transfected using 0.5 μg of DNA and 1 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 500 μl of serum-free Opti-MEM 1. After a 24-h incubation, cells were plated onto 13-mm no. 1 coverslips for electrophysiological experiments and left to grow in DMEM. Cells were subjected to experiments 24–48 h after transfection. Cells were transfected with wild-type human P2X1-5 or 7 receptors. P2X4 and P2X7 receptor DNAs were kindly given by Drs. F. Rassendren (CNRS Montpellier, France) and L.-H. Jiang (University of Leeds, UK). For the human P2X5 receptor, a 1353-bp DNA sequence was designed containing the full coding sequence for human P2X5, including exon 10 as described (26Kotnis S. Bingham B. Vasilyev D.V. Miller S.W. Bai Y. Yeola S. Chanda P.K. Bowlby M.R. Kaftan E.J. Samad T.A. Whiteside G.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 77: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Bo X. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. Kim M. Burnstock G. Surprenant A. North R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) with 5′ HindIII and 3′ EcoRI restriction enzyme sites. The DNA fragment was codon optimized for Homo sapiens, checked for secondary structure, synthesized (Epoch Lifescience Inc., Missouri City, TX), and cloned into a pBluescript vector from which it was subsequently subcloned into pcDNA3. HEK293 cells were also co-transfected with human P2X1 and P2X5 DNAs. However, we only observed small P2X1/5-like currents (∼45 pA/pF) in 2 of 17 tested cells (three different transfections), and so the effects of actin disruption were not tested. Chimeric P2X1/2 receptors and EGFP-tagged P2X1 receptors were as described previously (13Lalo U. Allsopp R.C. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Evans R.J. J. Neurochem. 2010; 113: 1177-1187PubMed Google Scholar, 18Allsopp R.C. Lalo U. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 32770-32777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Rat tail artery was dissected and smooth muscle cells isolated enzymatically as described previously (14Lewis C.J. Evans R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 1659-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto glass coverslips and recordings made within 1–6 h of isolation. Whole cell and permeabilized patch voltage clamp recordings were made using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Membrane currents were recorded at a holding potential of −70 mV (corrected for tip potential). Data were low pass-filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at a sampling interval of 200 μs, and acquired using a Digidata 1200 analog-to-digital converter with pClamp 9.2 acquisition software (Axon Instruments). Patch pipettes were filled with internal solution composed of 140 mm potassium gluconate, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm NaCl (pH 7.3, adjusted with KOH) and had resistances in the range of 2–6 megohms. For perforated patch pipette recordings amphotericin B was added to the internal solution at a final concentration of 200 μg ml−1. The bath was perfused continuously with extracellular solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose (pH 7.3, adjusted with NaOH). Agonists were applied with a U-tube perfusion system. For P2X1 receptors repeated applications of agonist (α,β-meATP) were separated by 5 min to allow recovery from receptor desensitization. P2X2–5 receptors were stimulated with 100 μm ATP; for P2X7 receptors BzATP (100 μm) was used, and the extracellular solution had reduced levels of divalent cations (0.3 mm CaCl2, 0 mm MgCl2). In the permeabilized patch configuration experiments drugs were added to the extracellular solution. For whole cell experiments we used cells pretreated in drug containing solution before recordings. Control untreated cells were recorded from every day, and comparisons between nontreated and treated cells were made between the cells from the same batch. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Confocal fluorescence measurements were made on an Olympus inverted microscope with a confocal laser scanning module (Olympus FluoView1000). Cells were observed with a 60 × oil immersion objective lens (UPLSAPO 60XO, NA 1.35). The EGFP fluorescence was excited with a 488-nm argon laser at low power, and emission was detected and collected from 500 to 600 nm at a rate of 0.5 Hz. Each FRAP experiment started with collection of 30 base-line control images of the cell followed by 1-s photobleach of the region of interest with laser pulse at full power to photobleach most of region of interest fluorescence. Typically, 100 images were recorded at low laser power after bleaching. Average fluorescence intensities of bleached, nonbleached, and background regions were recorded for each time point. Fluorescence signals were background-subtracted, corrected for fading of fluorescence during the experiment and expressed as F/Fi ratios to normalize fluorescence levels (F) against starting fluorescence (Fi). Fluorescence intensities of the region of interest were obtained using FluoView software and plotted. HEK293 cells expressing P2X1 receptors were cultured in 6-well plates and treated with cytochalasin D (500 nm, 1 h). Surface proteins were biotinylated by the addition of 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (sulfo-biotin; Pierce) diluted in PBS (30 min at 4 °C). Excess biotin was quenched with two 20-min (4 °C) washes with 100 mm glycine in PBS. Cells were lysed in 300 μl of buffer H (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, and 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (P8340; Sigma)), incubated on ice for 20 min, and cleared by centrifugation (4 °C at 16,000 × g for 10 min). For isolation of biotinylated proteins, 30 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) were added to 200 μl of supernatant and mixed on a rolling shaker (4 °C, 3 h). The rest of the supernatant was kept to assess total protein for each sample. Beads were washed four times in buffer H and 30 μl of 2 × gel sample loading buffer added. Samples were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Membranes were then processed with the primary anti-P2X1 receptor antibodies (1:1000; Alomone). Protein bands were visualized using an ECL Plus kit and Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). Data were analyzed with CLAMPFIT (Axon Instruments) or ORIGIN 6.0 (Microcal Software, Northampton MA). The kinetics of FRAP has been analyzed by fitting the curve of fluorescence intensity with model curves with monoexponential rise and decay phases (13Lalo U. Allsopp R.C. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Evans R.J. J. Neurochem. 2010; 113: 1177-1187PubMed Google Scholar). The time constants of recovery (τ) was determined as time constant of the fast component and optimized by the gradient method to minimize the mean square error (28Pankratov Y.V. Krishtal O.A. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 3375-3387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Data in the text and graphs are shown as means ± S.E. of mean from n determinations as indicated and analyzed either by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparisons test using the unpaired Student's t test as appropriate, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. A His-FLAG epitope tag was added to the carboxyl terminus of the human P2X1 receptor to purify the receptor stably expressed in HEK293 cells. The tag had no effect on P2X1 receptor properties, similar to the lack of effect of addition of the much larger EGFP tag (13Lalo U. Allsopp R.C. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Evans R.J. J. Neurochem. 2010; 113: 1177-1187PubMed Google Scholar). An anti-FLAG affinity agarose gel column was used to isolate the P2X1 receptor and associated proteins. The P2X1 receptor was eluted with FLAG peptide and fractions containing the P2X1 receptor identified by Western blotting with an antibody directed against the receptor carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1). These fractions were pooled, concentrated, and run out on a gel, and proteins were visualized. In control studies where nontransfected HEK293 cells were used no P2X1 receptor or other proteins were detected in the elutions. Similarly when a general protein stain was used or when sections of the gel were excised digested and analyzed by mass spectrometry no proteins were detected. In contrast, when the P2X1 His-FLAG stable cell line was used and the eluate run on a gel a range of protein bands was detected. The strongest of these was ∼55 kDa; this band was excised from the gel subjected to tryptic digestion and analyzed by mass spectrometry and shown to correspond to the P2X1 receptor protein. A number of other protein bands were also detected following P2X1 receptor isolation, and these were subsequently identified and shown to contain a range of cytoskeletal proteins (supplemental Table 1) including actin and tubulin. P2X1-His-FLAG-expressing cells were also treated with the membrane-permeant cross-linking reagent DSP. This would be expected to isolate proteins that have a less stringent interaction with the receptor or are associated with P2X1 receptor accessory proteins within a signaling complex. Following cross-linking with DSP a number of additional cytoskeletal interacting proteins were identified following P2X1 receptor isolation (supplemental Table 1) including ezrin and annexins. The protein purification studies suggested that P2X1 receptors interact with the actin cytoskeleton. To test whether this interaction is important for P2X1 receptor function cytochalasin D was used to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton by facilitating ATP-actin hydrolysis (29Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). In the permeabilized patch recording configuration (to maintain the integrity of intracellular signaling pathways) α,β-meATP (10 μm, an EC90 concentration) evoked reproducible inward currents (mean amplitude 740 ± 38 pA, current density 105 ± 6 pA/pF, n = 8) at recombinant human P2X1 receptors expressed in HEK293 cells. Cytochalasin D (5 μm, applied acutely in the bath) reduced the peak amplitude of currents; this effect was time-dependent and reached ∼80% inhibition by 20-min application (in control conditions average amplitude of current was 92.3 ± 2.4%, n = 5, and in the presence of cytochalasin it was 9.8 ± 4.6%, n = 6, of initial value, p < 0.0001; Fig. 2, A and B). This inhibitory effect was not dependent on repeated receptor activation because the extent of reduction in current amplitude was the same whether the P2X1 receptor was stimulated every 5 min during the 20-min application or was only stimulated at the end of the 20-min application period (Fig. 2, A and B). Cytochalasin treatment, however, had no effect on the time course of P2X1 receptor currents (decay time constant for P2X1 receptor mediated currents evoked by 10 μm α,β-meATP in control 220.6 ± 11.7 ms, n = 67 and 209.3 ± 28.4 ms, n = 12 after treatment with cytochalasin). Latrunculin-A (500 nm, 1-h treatment at room temperature; Fig. 2, C and D), which prevents actin monomers repolymerizing into filaments (mechanistically different from cytochalasin D) (30Morton W.M. Ayscough K.R. McLaughlin P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), also produced a similar reduction in peak amplitude (73.4 ± 6% decrease, n = 10, p = 0.0002). The effects of cytoskeletal disruption were also tested on native P2X1 receptors from acutely dissociated rat tail artery smooth muscle cells. α,β-meATP (10 μm) evoked desensitizing currents from artery smooth muscle cells that were reduced by ∼65% following cytochalasin treatment (n = 10, Fig. 2C, 296.1 ± 34.1 pA/pF in control, 103.3 ± 24.9 pA/pF after treatment with cytochalasin D, p < 0.05). These results suggest that that the cytoskeleton plays an important regulatory role on P2X1 receptor function. To determine whether cytochalasin treatment decreased the expression of P2X1 receptors membrane-impermeant sulfo-NHS LC biotin was used to label cell surface proteins selectively. These were then isolated with streptavidin beads, and Western blotting was used to quantify surface expression levels. The P2X1 receptor antibody detected a band of ∼55 kDa from HEK293 cells stably expressing the P2X1 receptor, consistent with the receptor running as a monomer under denaturing conditions (31Ennion S. Hagan S. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29361-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Cytochalasin treatment had no effect on the surface expression of P2X1 receptors (Fig. 2E), indicating that an effect on receptor trafficking or turnover is unlikely to account for the reduction in P2X1 receptor current amplitude in response to cytochalasin treatment. The actin cytoskeleton is dynamic and continually undergoing ATP-dependent repolymerization. The rundown of P2X1 receptor currents in the whole cell recording configuration, which results in dialysis of the cell, was partially rescued by the inclusion of 5 mm ATP in the patch electrode recording solution (but not by inclusion of GTP or PiP2, supplemental Figs. 1 and 2). This raised the possibility that disruption of ATP-dependent actin polymerization may underlie P2X1 receptor current rundown as has been shown for NMDA receptor channels (32Rosenmund C. Westbrook G.L. Neuron. 1993; 10: 805-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton with jasplakinolide (30 nm, 1-h treatment at room temperature) had no effect on P2X1 receptor current rundown in whole cell recordings (Fig. 3), suggesting that rundown does not result from a disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Jasplakinolide had no effect on the reproducibility of responses in the permeabilized patch configuration (Fig. 3). Jasplakinolide also reversed the effects of cytochalasin treatment (80 ± 4 and 51 ± 5% reduction in peak current amplitude for cytochalasin and cytochalasin + jasplakinolide, respectively, p < 0.05). These results show that it is not dynamic changes in actin polymerization, but an intact actin cytoskeleton that is required for normal P2X1 receptor function. FRAP studies on EGFP-tagged P2X1 receptors have shown that the receptors are mobile in the membrane (13Lalo U. Allsopp R.C. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Evans R.J. J. Neurochem. 2010; 113: 1177-1187PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study a brief laser pulse was used to photobleach an area of the cell surface, within 5 min P2X1-EGFP fluorescence had recovered in this region by ∼75% similar to that reported previously (13Lalo U. Allsopp R.C. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Evans R.J. J. Neurochem. 2010; 113: 1177-1187PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). This demonstrates that at least 75% of the receptors are mobile and moving within a 5-min time frame. The ∼25% fluorescence that does not recover most likely corresponds to bleached receptors that do not move out of the illuminated area and are referred to as the immobile fraction. Disruption of the cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D (500 nm, 1-h treatment at room temperature) increased the recovery in fluorescence and reduced the immobile fraction to 14.7 ± 4.4% (n = 9, p < 0.05) (Fig. 4). In contrast, stabilization of the cytoskeleton with jasplakinolide (30 nm, 1-h treatment at room temperature) increased the immobile fraction to 39.3 ± 2.8% (n = 20, p < 0.05) (Fig. 4). The change in the immobile fraction does not result from a general change in membrane fluidity and mobility of receptors as previous studies have shown that the immobile fraction of ionotropic nicotinic (33Fernandes C.C.

Mahaut Smith, unpublished observations. are not affected by actin disruption. These results demonstrate that the actin cytoskeleton regulates mobility of the P2X1 receptor in the membrane. To gain an insight into the extent of cytoskeletal regulation of the P2X receptor family, the effects of cytochalasin D treatment (500 nm, 1-h treatment at room temperature) were determined on P2X2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 receptors transiently transfected into HEK293 cells. ATP-evoked currents at P2X3 receptors were reduced by ∼ 71.7 ± 8.2% (n = 17) following cytochalasin treatment (Fig. 5), but the time course of P2X3 receptor current desensitization was unaffected (data not shown). In contrast, homomeric P2X2, 4, 5, and 7 receptor currents were unaffected following cytoskeletal disruption. The lack of effect of cytochalasin on P2X7 receptor currents is consistent with previous studies on preassembled P2X7 receptors in acinar cells (34Li Q. Luo X. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47554-47561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that regulation of P2X receptors by the cytoskeleton is subtype-specific. We have previously generated chimeric P2X1/2 receptors to address the molecular basis of regulation by lipid rafts, and these chimeras (18Allsopp R.C. Lalo U. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 32770-32777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have been used in this study to identify regions of the receptor important for cytoskeletal regulation. Chimeric P2X1/2 receptors where the two transmembrane regions (P2X1–2bd), the extracellular loop (P2X1–2c), or the intracellular carboxyl terminus (P2X1–2eα and P2X1–2eβ) of the P2X1 receptor were replaced with the corresponding region from the P2X2 receptor showed the same level of inhibition following cytochalasin treatment (500 nm, 1-h treatment at room temperature) as the homomeric P2X1 receptor (Fig. 6).

Several studies have indicated outcome differences associated with ancestry among patients with various cancer types. Using both traditional SNP-based and newly developed gene-based genome-wide approaches, we investigated the genetics of chemotherapeutic susceptibility in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 83 African Americans, a population for which there is a disparity in the number of genome-wide studies performed. To account for population structure in this admixed population, we incorporated local ancestry information into our association model. We tested over 2 million SNPs and identified 325, 176, 240, and 190 SNPs that were suggestively associated with cytarabine-, 5′-deoxyfluorouridine (5′-DFUR)-, carboplatin-, and cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity, respectively (p≤10−4). Importantly, some of these variants are found only in populations of African descent. We also show that cisplatin-susceptibility SNPs are enriched for carboplatin-susceptibility SNPs. Using a gene-based genome-wide association approach, we identified 26, 11, 20, and 41 suggestive candidate genes for association with cytarabine-, 5′-DFUR-, carboplatin-, and cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity, respectively (p≤10−3). Fourteen of these genes showed evidence of association with their respective chemotherapeutic phenotypes in the Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria (p<0.05), including TP53I11, COPS5 and GAS8, which are known to be involved in tumorigenesis. Although our results require further study, we have identified variants and genes associated with chemotherapeutic susceptibility in African Americans by using an approach that incorporates local ancestry information."

J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Fourteen identical GroEL subunits assemble into a cylindrical structure of two heptameric rings stacked back to back, with a functional central cavity at either end (8Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Each GroEL subunit is organized into three domains. The apical domains, located on the opening of the rings, form the main substrate-binding site and interact with GroES. The equatorial domains, situated in the center of the cylindrical GroEL, provide most of the intra-ring and all the inter-ring subunit interactions and contain the nucleotide-binding site. The intermediate domains connect the apical and the equatorial domains, transmitting signals including substrate binding and nucleotide effect across the subunits. The surface lining the GroEL central cavity is mainly hydrophobic, and this hydrophobic character has been shown to be important for capturing and interacting with misfolding protein substrates (9Fenton W.A.

The homoheptameric GroES adopts a dome-like assembly with each monomer folding into a β-barrel structure flanked by a structurally flexible loop termed the GroES mobile loop (13Hunt J.F. Weaver A.J.

The crystal structure of GroEL-ADP7-GroES shows that binding of GroES converts the GroEL central cavity to an enclosed chamber (termed the cis complex) (19Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Three hydrophobic GroES residues (Ile-25, Val-26, and Leu-27), of the GroES mobile loop, interact with residues from the GroEL apical domain (see Fig. 1A), and the GroES-GroEL interface is largely hydrophobic. Binding of GroES to one GroEL ring transforms the surface of the GroEL central cavity from hydrophobic, favorable for binding misfolded substrate proteins, to folding promoting hydrophilic. The double ring assembly of GroEL is essential for the GroE-assisted protein folding reaction. The substrate protein initiates folding within the isolated folding favorable environment upon displacement from the wall of the GroEL central cavity due to GroES association and is released outside the GroE capsule following GroES departure. Both dissociation and association of GroES are ATP-driven and are mediated by the intricate and highly coordinated cross-ring allostery. ATP hydrolysis in the GroES-bound GroEL ring (cis ring) weakens GroES-GroEL interaction (20Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar); however, the hydrolysis product, GroES-GroELcis-ADP7-GroELtrans, is still very stable with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.1–26 nm (16Todd M.J.

To finally discharge GroES from the cis ring, thereby releasing the folding substrate, binding of ATP to the other (trans) GroEL ring is required (20Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M.

The newly ATP-charged trans ring, which is prone to GroES association, becomes a “new” folding active cis chamber, whereas the collapsing cis chamber assumes inactive state. Thus, in assisting protein folding, the two GroEL rings communicate to alternate between folding active and inactive states, and GroEL functions as a two-stroke molecular machine (1Sigler P.B. Xu Z.

Although GroELSR and GroES may form the folding chamber for substrate proteins to undergo and complete folding, substrate proteins are not released from the chaperonin system (20Rye H.S. Burston S.G.

Dissociation of the GroELSR-GroES complex is very slow (the half-life t½ of GroELSR-GroES is ∼300 min) (29Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A.

As a result, the highly stable GroELSR-GroES complex traps the folding substrate proteins, stalling the chaperonin reaction cycle. Thus, GroELSR is unable to substitute GroEL for cell growth (33Weber F. Keppel F. Georgopoulos C. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Nat. Struct.

The folding active GroELSR-GroES systems consist of variants of GroELSR, identified from genetic analysis (34Chatellier J. Hill F. Foster N.W. Goloubinoff P. Fersht A.R. J. Mol.

Lund P.A. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 2365-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Reduced GroEL-GroES interaction has been implicated in these folding active GroELSR-GroES variants; however, the basis for the mutational effect is not immediately clear. For example, the affected GroEL residues are not located on the GroEL-GroES interface and most likely interfere with the ATP-driven, highly coordinated structural transitions that are obligated in the GroE reaction. Intriguingly, the weakened GroEL-GroES interaction in these folding active single ring chaperonin systems is reminiscent of mammalian mitochondrial chaperonin mtHsp60-mtHsp10 system. mtHsp60 exists as a single heptameric ring in solution (38Viitanen P.V.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5871-5875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although a mechanism involving a transiently associated double ring has been proposed (40Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G. Bergmeier W. Weiss C. Kessel M. Goloubinoff P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 41Todd M.J. Walke S. Lorimer G. Truscott K. Scopes R.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14932-14941Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Moreover, the mtHsp60-mtHsp10 interaction appears to be transient in the presence of ADP (23Nielsen K.L. Cowan N.J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 93-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this study, we directly explored the notion that weakened GroEL-GroES interaction may restore the substrate folding function of GroELSR. We took a unique strategy to create GroES variants with various affinities for GroEL in a systematical and controlled manner. We constructed a covalently linked groES variant, groES7, so that we could independently substitute residues in individual GroES subunits. We examined these GroES7 variants for their function with both the double ring GroEL and the single ring GroELSR. In addition to the mechanistic understanding of how a GroEL ring assists protein folding, studies of active GroELSR-GroES systems may provide useful information on the mechanism of mtHsp60-mtHsp10 in mammalian mitochondria. To construct the covalently connected groES7, groES was amplified with primers including the desired restriction site sequences, to generate seven groES containing DNA fragments: groES1 (with NdeI and KpnI), groES2 (with KpnI and XhoI), groES3 (with XhoI and SalI), groES4 (with SalI and SacI), groES5 (with SacI and BamHI), groES6 (with BamHI and EagI), and groES7 (with EagI and HindIII). groES1 and groES2 were digested with KpnI, purified, and ligated to generate the groES1-groES2 fragment, which was further amplified by PCR for a sufficient quantity. Fragments of groES3-groES4 and groES5-groES6-groES7 were generated in a similar manner, and so was the groES1-…-groES7 fragment, which was digested with NdeI and HindIII and inserted into a modified pET28b vector, whose region between HindIII and Bpu was replaced with a short DNA oligonucleotide. To generate GroES7 mutants, a mutation was first introduced into the regular groES construct using QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The mutated groES was amplified with primers including the desired restriction site sequences and ligated to a TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The circularized TOPO vector was transformed into TOP10 cells for amplification and digested with specific restriction enzymes to generate the groES mutant gene with defined restriction cuts, which was inserted via the corresponding sites into the groES7 pET28b construct. DNA sequencing was performed on the entire groES7 gene to confirm that mutation was only on the designated module(s). When expressed, GroES7 has a His6 tag on the N terminus of the protein. groES7 pET28b was transformed into BL21DE3 for overexpression. Cells were grown in LB medium until A600 reached 0.6, induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and continued for 4–5 h. Cells were re-suspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole, and lysed using a microfluidizer (Microfluidics). The clear cell lysate was loaded onto a Ni affinity column, and GroES7 was eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole (5–500 mm). The GroES7-containing fractions were combined, concentrated, dialyzed to 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and loaded onto a FastQ column (GE Healthcare), and GroES7 was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1 m). The GroES7-containing fractions were combined, concentrated, dialyzed to 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and loaded onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). Cell growth and protein purification of GroEL and GroELSR were similar, as described in Ref. 42Li Y. Zheng Z. Ramsey A. Chen L. J. Pept. Sci. 2010; 16: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar. A purification step using 30% methanol followed by an additional size exclusion chromatography was included to ensure high quality of GroEL and GroELSR, and tryptophan fluorescence confirmed the absence of bound peptides. Protein expression and purification of wild-type and GroES mutants were based on the previous procedures (19Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The steady-state ATP hydrolysis rate was measured using the malachite green assay (43Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). GroEL or GroELSR was added to TEA buffer (50 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, and 20 mm MgCl2) to a final concentration of 0.125 μm (tetradecameric GroEL) or 0.25 μm (heptameric GroELSR). The final concentration of GroES (heptamer) and GroES7 proteins was 0.3 μm. The solution was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. The hydrolysis was initiated by addition of 100 mm pH 7.0 ATP to a final concentration of 2 mm and followed every 2 min for 12 min using the malachite green assay. MDH was unfolded in TEA buffer including 3 m GdmHCl to a final concentration of 36.7 μm (monomeric MDH). To refold MDH, 2.75 μl of unfolded MDH was diluted at 1:100 (v/v) to a final volume of 275 μl of refolding solution (at 30 °C) containing 50 mm TEA, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm ATP, and 1 μm tetradecameric GroEL (or 2 μm heptameric GroELSR) with 4 μm or without GroES. At desired time intervals, 20 μl of reaction solution was removed and mixed with 1 ml of NADH assay solution (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mm DTT, 0.2 mm NADH, 1 mm ketomalonate), and absorption at 340 nm was taken to monitor the decrease of NADH (44Ranson N.A. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As a positive control, activity of 367 nm native MDH (monomeric concentration) was measured at the same time intervals and was taken as 100% activity. Refolded and active MDH converts NADH to NAD+. To decrease GroEL-GroES interaction, the three GroEL-interacting residues, Ile-25, Val-26, and Leu-27, on the GroEL-GroES interface (Fig. 1A) were individually substituted to Asp, resulting in GroESI25D, GroESV26D, and GroESL27D variants. When incubated with GroEL in the presence of ADP, both GroESI25D and GroESL27D variants could not form a stable complex with GroEL; they were largely absent by SDS-PAGE analysis on the GroEL-containing fractions (supplemental Fig. S1A). Interestingly, the GroESV26D variant, albeit containing a total of seven substitutions in heptameric form, could still form the GroEL-GroES complex, as suggested by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1A). Previous studies show that in forming a complex with GroEL, GroES inhibits the ATP hydrolysis rate of GroEL by ∼50% (16Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H.

Neither GroESI25D nor GroESL27D variants altered GroEL ATP hydrolysis significantly (supplemental Fig. S1B), whereas the GroESV26D variant reduced GroEL ATPase function in a manner similar to the wild-type GroES. These findings are consistent with the model that both GroESI25D and GroESL27D variants did not associate with GroEL, whereas GroESV26D formed a stable complex with GroEL. To further confirm the mutational effects, the GroES variants were subjected to a substrate protein folding study. The spontaneous folding of MDH is low (∼5%), and the complete chaperonin system, including GroEL, GroES, and ATP, is required to achieve efficient MDH folding (47Ben-Zvi A.P. Chatellier J. Fersht A.R. Goloubinoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 15275-15280Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), indicating that formation of the folding active GroEL-GroES chamber is essential for MDH folding. Supplemental Fig. S1C shows that neither GroESI25D nor GroESL27D supported GroE-assisted MDH folding, suggesting that both variants were not able to form a functional complex with GroEL. As expected, folding of MDH using GroESV26D was as efficient and effective as using the wild-type GroES, indicating formation of the GroESV26D-GroEL complex. Taken together, these findings confirm the critical function of GroES residues Ile-25 and Leu-27 in GroEL-GroES interaction and indicate a minor role of GroES Val-26 in complex formation. We next examined whether the observed mutational effects of I25D, V26D, and L27D on GroEL-GroES interaction were applicable to the GroELSR-GroES system. GroES inhibits the ATP hydrolysis rate of GroELSR by up to ∼90% (29Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). As shown in supplemental Fig. S1B, GroESV26D decreased the ATPase activity of GroELSR to a level comparable with that of wild-type GroES. In contrast, both GroESI25D and GroESL27D did not affect the ATP hydrolysis rate of GroELSR. These results are parallel to those using GroEL, further substantiating the importance of Ile-25 and Leu-27, in contrast to the minimal role of Val-26, in GroEL-GroES interaction. These observations are consistent with results of sequence analysis on 31 GroES homologous proteins from prokaryotes to eukaryotes (48Gupta R.S. Ellis R.J. The Chaperonins. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 27-64Crossref Google Scholar). Ile and Leu are highly conserved at position 25 (96% of sequences) and position 27 (94%), respectively, whereas the amino acid at position 26 is more diverse: Val (48%), Ile (29%), Leu (10%), Met (7%), Phe (3%), and Gln (3%). When assaying for MDH folding activity, we found that none of the three mutants was able to cooperate with GroELSR to assist MDH folding; however, the inactivation mechanisms are different. Considering the similar binding affinities of GroESV26D and GroES for GroEL, the observed limited MDH folding using GroESV26D should be most likely due to the folding MDH trapped within the nondissociable GroESV26D-GroELSR complex. On the other hand, given the abolishing effect of I25D or L27D mutation on GroEL-GroES interaction, the minimal MDH activity observed with GroESI25D or GroESL27D and GroELSR is most likely due to the lack of formation of the folding chamber, which is essential for MDH folding (47Ben-Zvi A.P. Chatellier J. Fersht A.R. Goloubinoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 15275-15280Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, straightforward manipulations on the GroEL-interacting residues of Ile-25, Val-26, and Leu-27 cannot confer the single ring GroELSR the sustainable substrate folding activity because the required enclosed folding chamber either is nonrecyclable (in the case of GroESV26D) or does not form (in the case of GroESI25D and GroESL27D). Alternatively, for GroESV26D, it might also be likely that its presumably decreased affinity for GroEL, although subtle, could not completely displace the protein substrate into the central cavity for folding (see “Discussion”). The abolished GroEL-GroES interaction observed in GroESI25D and GroESL27D may be explained by the 7-fold amplified mutational effect because a single gene modification in groES transforms into seven amino acid substitutions in the GroES heptamer. We reasoned that if some of the seven GroES subunits maintained the wild-type sequence, the resulting GroES variants would display different levels of reduced affinities for GroEL. We hypothesized that these GroEL-binding compromised GroES variants might cooperate with GroELSR to complete the chaperonin reaction cycle. To modify an individual GroES subunit, we took advantage of the observation that the N and C termini of neighboring GroES subunits in heptameric GroES are within 5 Å (Cα-Cα distance) (19Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B) and created a synthetic gene, groES7, concatenating seven copies of the groES gene (Fig. 1C). The expressed protein, GroES7, consists of seven GroES modules, corresponding to the seven GroES subunits in the canonical GroES homoheptamer, in one contiguous polypeptide chain. Linker sequences of four amino acids (consisting of Gly, Ser, or Ala) give flexibility between subunits. Distinct restriction sites are designed to flank each groES gene, so that modifications can be introduced into the specific position(s) of the desired module(s). We used groES7 to incorporate I25D or L27D substitutions in specific GroES modules, to create GroES7 variants with a range of weakened affinities for GroEL. To examine the effect of the peptide linkers tethering neighboring GroES modules, we compared the structural and functional aspects of GroES7 with the canonical GroES heptamer. GroES7 (theoretical molecular mass of 76,721 Da) migrated as a molecular species with the molecular size of 82.2 kDa estimated from gel filtration chromatography, whereas the molecular size of the canonical GroES heptamer (theoretical molecular mass of 72,723 Da) was estimated to be 71.3 kDa by gel filtration. Like GroES, GroES7 formed a complex with GroEL in the presence of nucleotides, as assayed by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2A). GroES7 decreased ATPase activity of GroEL to a level comparable with that using GroES (Fig. 2B). Moreover, GroES7 assisted MDH refolding in a manner similar to GroES, with comparable reaction kinetics and refolding yield (Fig. 2C). The resemblances of GroES7 to GroES were extended to their interaction with GroELSR. As shown in Fig. 2B, GroES7 diminished ATPase activity of GroELSR to a level similar to that using GroES (∼10% of the intrinsic rate of GroELSR). Like GroES, GroES7 could only support the minimal MDH folding by GroELSR (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data show that the covalently linked single chain GroES7 is similar to the wild-type GroES in all the measures examined. Studies using the covalently linked GroES have been reported, and the additional peptide linkers are found not to have functional interference (49Sakane I. Hongo K. Motojima F. Murayama S. Mizobata T. Kawata Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1171-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 50Nojima T. Murayama S. Yoshida M. Motojima F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18385-18392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Given that seven I25D and L27D substitutions on GroES completely disrupted GroEL-GroES interaction, we introduced the substitutions at subsets of GroES modules in GroES7, with the intention to generate GroES7 variants with a range of weakened affinities for GroEL. So far, we have created mono-, di-, and tri-substituted GroES7 variants as follows: GroES7I25D1, GroES7I25D1,4, and GroES7I25D1,4,7; GroES7L27D1, GroES7L27D1,4, and GroES7L27D1,4,7. (The subscripts denote the modified GroES module(s) in GroES7.) As a comparison, we also prepared V26D substitutions: GroES7V26D1, GroES7V26D1,4, and GroES7V26D1,4,7; the GroES7V26D variants were not expected to have altered affinity for GroEL. Compared with the completely depleted inhibition of GroESI25D or GroESL27D on GroEL ATPase activity, substitutions of I25D and L27D in GroES7 generated a range of effects on GroEL ATP hydrolysis rates. In both the GroES7I25D and GroES7L27D series, GroEL ATPase activity increased with the number of substitution (Fig. 3A). When three substitutions were incorporated into GroES7 as in GroES7I25D1,4,7 and GroES7L27D1,4,7, the inhibition changed from 50% to 10–20% of the intrinsic GroEL ATP hydrolysis rate. Because a large inhibition may presumably be correlated with the strong GroEL-GroES interaction, these findings suggest that the substituted GroES7 variants display different affinities for GroEL and that they do not interact with GroEL as strongly as the wild-type GroES. As expected, V26D substitutions in GroES7 did not alter GroES function, as variants of GroES7V26D affected GroEL ATPase activity in a manner similar to GroES (supplemental Fig. S2A). Given that variants of GroES7I25D and GroES7L27D inhibited GroEL ATPase activity to various extents, we next investigated how the altered ATP hydrolysis rate of the modified chaperonin system influenced MDH folding. A single substitution of GroES7I25D1 slowed the MDH folding rate but wi"

Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), reduces VLDL levels and is used therapeutically for hypertriglyceridemia. In model systems, DHA lowers VLDL secretion by inducing presecretory apoB100 degradation, a process dependent on PUFA-derived lipid peroxides. We hypothesized that superoxide (SO) was a major participant in DHA-induced apoB100 degradation, given its promotion of lipid peroxidation. SO levels in a model of VLDL metabolism, rat hepatoma McArdle cells, were either decreased by a mimetic of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) or by overexpressing SOD1 or increased by SOD1 siRNA. ApoB100 recovery was assessed by immunoprecipitation, SO by 2-hydroxyethidine, and lipid peroxides by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. The SOD1 mimetic or SOD1 overexpression reduced SO and inhibited apoB100 degradation in DHA-treated cells by up to 100%. Surprisingly, silencing SOD1 did not increase DHA-induced degradation, although levels of SO were higher (+44%); those of lipid peroxides were similar, and their reduction by α-tocopherol decreased degradation by 50%. SO is required for lipid peroxidation in DHA-induced apoB100 degradation, but it is the peroxide level that has a tighter relationship to the level of degradation and the regulation of VLDL production.—Andreo, U., Elkind, J., Blachford, C., Cederbaum, A.

https://openalex.org/W2082961436,"Pendrin and prestin both belong to a distinct anion transporter family called solute carrier protein 26A, or SLC26A. Pendrin (SLC26A4) is a chloride-iodide transporter that is found at the luminal membrane of follicular cells in the thyroid gland as well as in the endolymphatic duct and sac of the inner ear, whereas prestin (SLC26A5) is expressed in the plasma membrane of cochlear outer hair cells and functions as a unique voltage-dependent motor. We recently identified a motif that is critical for the motor function of prestin. We questioned whether it was possible to create a chimeric pendrin protein with motor capability by integrating this motility motif from prestin. The chimeric pendrin was constructed by substituting residues 160-179 in human pendrin with residues 156-169 from gerbil prestin. Non-linear capacitance and somatic motility, two hallmarks representing prestin function, were measured from chimeric pendrin-transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells using the voltage clamp technique and photodiode-based displacement measurement system. We showed that this 14-amino acid substitution from prestin was able to confer pendrin with voltage-dependent motor capability despite the amino acid sequence disparity between pendrin and prestin. The molecular mechanism that facilitates motor function appeared to be the same as prestin because the motor activity depended on the concentration of intracellular chloride and was blocked by salicylate treatment. Radioisotope-labeled formate uptake measurements showed that the chimeric pendrin protein retained the capability to transport formate, suggesting that the gain of motor function was not at the expense of its inherent transport capability. Thus, the engineered pendrin was capable of both transporting anions and generating force."

Using mutant cycle analysis and unnatural residue mutagenesis, including backbone mutagenesis of the peptide bond of the vicinal disulfide, we have established the presence of a network of hydrogen bonds that extends from that peptide NH, across a β turn to another backbone hydrogen bond, and then across the subunit interface to the side chain of a functionally important Asp residue in the non-α subunit.

In this study we demonstrate that elevated IKKα expression in murine epidermis increases the malignancy potential of skin tumors. We describe the generation of transgenic mice overexpressing IKKα in the basal, proliferative layer of the epidermis and in the outer root sheath of hair follicles. The epidermis of K5-IKKα transgenic animals shows several alterations such as hyperproliferation, mislocalized expression of integrin-α6 and downregulation of the tumor suppressor maspin. Treatment of the back skin of mice with the mitogenic agent 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate causes in transgenic mice the appearance of different preneoplastic changes such as epidermal atypia with loss of cell polarity and altered epidermal tissue architecture, while in wild type littermates this treatment only leads to the development of benign epidermal hyperplasia. Moreover, in skin carcinogenesis assays, transgenic mice carrying active Ha-ras (K5-IKKα-Tg.AC mice) develop invasive tumors, instead of the benign papillomas arising in wild type-Tg-AC mice also bearing an active Ha-ras. Therefore we provide evidence for a tumor promoter role of IKKα in skin cancer, similarly to what occurs in other neoplasias, including hepatocarcinomas and breast, prostate and colorectal cancer. The altered expression of cyclin D1, maspin and integrin-α6 in skin of transgenic mice provides, at least in part, the molecular bases for the increased malignant potential found in the K5-IKKα skin tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1997945688,"Objective Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been characterized by abnormalities in emotional processing. However, what remains unclear is whether MDD also shows deficits in the unconscious processing of either positive or negative emotions. We conducted a psychological study in healthy and MDD subjects to investigate unconscious emotion processing and its valence-specific alterations in MDD patients. Methods We combined a well established paradigm for unconscious visual processing, the continuous flash suppression, with positive and negative emotional valences to detect the attentional preference evoked by the invisible emotional facial expressions. Results Healthy subjects showed an attentional bias for negative emotions in the unconscious condition while this valence bias remained absent in MDD patients. In contrast, this attentional bias diminished in the conscious condition for both healthy subjects and MDD. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate for the first time valence-specific deficits specifically in the unconscious processing of emotions in MDD; this may have major implications for subsequent neurobiological investigations as well as for clinical diagnosis and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2000263240,"We examined over 50 mutations in the Drosophila βPS integrin subunit that alter integrin function in situ for their ability to bind a soluble monovalent ligand, TWOW-1. Surprisingly, very few of the mutations, which were selected for conditional lethality in the fly, reduce the ligand binding ability of the integrin. The most prevalent class of mutations activates the integrin heterodimer. These findings emphasize the importance of integrin affinity regulation and point out how molecular interactions throughout the integrin molecule are important in keeping the integrin in a low affinity state. Mutations strongly support the controversial deadbolt hypothesis, where the CD loop in the β tail domain acts to restrain the I domain in the inactive, bent conformation. Site-directed mutations in the cytoplasmic domains of βPS and αPS2C reveal different effects on ligand binding from those observed for αIIbβ3 integrins and identify for the first time a cytoplasmic cysteine residue, conserved in three human integrins, as being important in affinity regulation. In the fly, we find that genetic interactions of the βPS mutations with reduction in talin function are consistent with the integrin affinity differences measured in cells. Additionally, these genetic interactions report on increased and decreased integrin functions that do not result in affinity changes in the PS2C integrin measured in cultured cells.

Additionally, these genetic interactions report on increased and decreased integrin functions that do not result in affinity changes in the PS2C integrin measured in cultured cells. Integrin cell surface receptors are important for morphogenetic events in normal development and are also critical for adult and many disease-related processes as well (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar). The integrin αβ heterodimer is a dynamic receptor, whose activity is regulated by interactions with extracellular, intracellular, and other transmembrane proteins. This regulation can change the affinity of individual integrin molecules or alter the clustering of integrins such that their avidity is altered. Experiments utilizing conformation-specific antibodies, high resolution x-ray, NMR, small angle neutron scattering, molecular dynamics, steered molecular dynamics, and electron microscopy are elucidating how the α and β subunits are organized and change in response to activating conditions and ligand binding. One goal of the current work on integrin biology is to understand how the structural information gained on isolated integrins relates to integrin function in a cellular context. Therefore, models for integrin activation are being tested by site-directed mutagenesis (reviewed in Refs. 2Shattil S.J. Kim C. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 3Luo B.H. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev.

We have used a complementary approach of first identifying amino acids in the Drosophila integrin βPS subunit that alter its function in the whole organism and then examining the effects of these mutations at the cellular and molecular level. Previous work demonstrated that myospheroid (mys, encoding βPS integrin) hypomorphic mutations displayed stronger phenotypes at higher temperatures (5Bunch T.A. Salatino R. Engelsgjerd M.C. Mukai L. West R.F. Brower D.L. Genetics. 1992; 132: 519-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we screened for mutations in mys that produce viable flies at low temperatures but lethality at high temperatures. Because null alleles of mys are completely lethal at all temperatures, we know that these mutations do not completely inactivate the function of the integrin but rather compromise its function. Due to unique properties of one of the mutants, mysb58, we examined it in detail and found that it is an activating mutation that results in an integrin with higher affinity for a soluble extracellular matrix ligand (6Jannuzi A.L. Bunch T.A. West R.F. Brower D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3829-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Bunch T.A. Helsten T.L. Kendall T.L. Shirahatti N. Mahadevan D. Shattil S.J. Brower D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5050-5057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). At that time, we suspected that mysb58 was unique among the mutants in our screen. We have now tested the ligand binding ability of all 50 of the mutants generated in our previous screen for function-altering alleles as well as a number of lethal mutants that produce mutant integrin subunits that are expressed on the cell surface and site-directed mutations suggested by our initial studies or results obtained in work on vertebrate integrins. The ligand binding assay that we used measures the ability of the cell surface integrin to bind to a monovalent ligand and therefore probes only the affinity of integrins for one ligand. The assay reports on the effect a mutation has on the regulation of integrin affinity, presumably by altering an amino acid contacting the ligand or one regulating integrin conformation. This is in contrast to the testing of numerous mutations in the human integrin β3 subunit generated by site-directed mutagenesis or identified in Glanzmann thrombasthenia patients. Typically, these mutations were tested for their ability to bind soluble multivalent ligands like PAC-1 IgM, PAC-1 Fab fragments in combination with polyclonal secondary antibodies, or fibrinogen. The activity of these mutant integrins as measured by these multivalent ligands did not distinguish between effects on affinity or clustering. Our results, specifically addressing affinity changes, do generally support the conclusions drawn from the use of multivalent ligands. To confirm that affinity changes measured in our cell culture assay have similar effects in the whole organism, we tested their effects in flies that expressed reduced levels of talin. Because talin increases integrin activity in flies (8Brown N.H. Gregory S.L. Rickoll W.L. Fessler L.I. Prout M. White R.A. Fristrom J.W. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 569-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 9Tanentzapf G. Brown N.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), reducing talin levels would be predicted to increase phenotypes (lethality in our tests) of mutations that we find reduce integrin affinity and rescue phenotypes of mutations that increase integrin affinity. In general this is what we find. Using this genetic interaction test, we also tested those mutants that did not show an alteration in affinity of PS2C integrins for soluble ligand. Most of these mutants showed increased integrin function in the organism. The surprising finding from our work is that most of our integrin mutations do not reduce the ability to bind ligand but actually enhance it. They are activating mutations. Expression, in flies, of activating deletion mutants of the αPS2 subunit was previously found to be unable to rescue the lethality of a null mutation in that subunit, pointing out in a different context the importance of proper regulation of integrin activity (10Martin-Bermudo M.D. Dunin-Borkowski O.M. Brown N.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We discuss our mutant results in the context of current structures available for the human αIIbβ3 integrin. We have additionally used site-directed mutagenesis to test the deadbolt hypothesis of integrin affinity regulation (11Arnaout M.A. Mahalingam B. Xiong J.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 381-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). This hypothesis predicts that the CD loop in the βTD (tail domain) contacts the β I domain in the bent conformation and restrains it in a low affinity state. Work on αIIbβ3 and αVβ3 integrins has yielded contradictory results (12Zhu J. Boylan B. Luo B.H. Newman P.J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11914-11920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Xiong J.P. Mahalingham B. Alonso J.L. Borrelli L.A. Rui X. Anand S. Hyman B.T. Rysiok T.

Our results on the Drosophila PS2C integrin strongly support the deadbolt hypothesis. Finally, site-directed mutagenesis suggests that a conserved cysteine in the cytoplasmic domain of αPS2C that is palmitoylated in human α3 and α6 is involved in affinity regulation. Drosophila S2/M3 cells were cultured in Shields and Sang M3 medium supplemented with 12% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum as described previously (14Bunch T.A. Brower D.L.

Transformed cells were selected in 2 × 10−7 m methotrexate. Prior to performing TWOW-1 assays, cells were treated with dsRNA targeting the 3′-untranslated sequence of mys for 3 days to remove expression of endogenous βPS integrin as described earlier (7Bunch T.A.

To remove preexisting integrins and matrix and to induce high expression from the heat shock-regulated integrin transgenes, cells were incubated at 36 °C with collagenase/dispase. Cells were washed and allowed to recover for 4 h at 23 °C. Cells were incubated with TWOW-1 for 10 min at room temperature. This was done in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ (standard binding); Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ (Mn2+-activated binding); or EDTA (non-binding). Buffer containing formaldehyde was added to fix the bound TWOW-1 to the cells. Bound TWOW-1 was detected with AlexaFluor488-labeled secondary antibody. Levels of PS2C integrin on the surface of cells were determined by staining with a biotin-labeled anti-αPS2 antibody (CF2C7) followed by detection with phycoerythrin-streptavidin. Fluorescence levels for both TWOW-1 and PS2 levels were analyzed by flow cytometry. Specific TWOW-1 binding is the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) 2The abbreviations used are: MFImean fluorescence intensityβTDβ tail domainI-EGFintegrin-EGFPSIplexin-semaphorin-integrinMIDASmetal ion-dependent adhesion siteADMIDASadjacent to MIDASSyMBSsynergistic metal binding site. of TWOW-1 binding minus the MFI of the same cells in the presence of EDTA. Typically, specific binding was greater than 90% of total binding. For our analyses, this specific binding is expressed relative to surface integrin expression (TWOW-1 MFI/anti-αPS2 MFI). Finally, because assays were conducted over a period of more than 2 years, expression and TWOW-1 MFI/anti-αPS2 MFI were normalized to a control cell line (untagged wild type line 1 or WT1) expressing wild type PS2C integrins that was included in every assay.

Site-directed mutations not obtained from genetic screens are designated as follows: βPS amino acid change (corresponding amino acid in β3). The βPS numbering begins with the start methionine as in our previous descriptions of these mutants (6Jannuzi A.L. Bunch T.A. West R.F. Brower D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3829-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The β3 numbering system begins with the first amino acid (G) in the mature, processed subunit and corresponds to the common β3 numbering used in the structure, Protein Data Bank entry 3FCS (16Zhu J. Luo B.H. Xiao T. Zhang C. Nishida N. Springer T.A. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 849-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), that we have used as a reference to assess likely consequences of our mutations. Unless otherwise noted, amino acid interactions are discussed using this structure as a reference, and the αIIb and β3 amino acids are presented in boldface type. To test mutant mys alleles for genetic interactions with talin, w mys/w mys (or w mys/FM7c);rhea+/rhea+ females were crossed to w mys+; rhea2 (w+)/TM3 Ser males. The mys alleles, located on the X chromosome, were generated in previous screens (6Jannuzi A.L. Bunch T.A. West R.F. Brower D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3829-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Wright, T. R. (1968) in Proceedings of the 12th Annual Congress on Genetics, Tokyo, Japan, Vol. 1, p. 41.Google Scholar). rhea2, located on chromosome 3, is a strong allele of the gene encoding talin (8Brown N.H.

Fristrom D. Fristrom J.W. Genetics. 1997; 146: 275-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crosses were done at a temperature (18, 22, 25, 28, or 31 °C) that resulted in reduced viability in mutant mys male progeny. This temperature differed for different mys mutant alleles and is indicated in supplemental Table S5. Due to sterility at 31 °C, tests at this temperature involved egg laying at 28 °C for 24–48 h, and then eggs and larvae were transferred to 31 °C. Progeny bearing one mutant copy of rhea were identified by the presence of a w+ transgene on the rhea2 chromosome (and the absence of Ser in the case of mysb3, mysb4, and mysts2, which contained a w+ gene on the chromosome containing the mys mutation). All male progeny were mutant for the mys allele, and females were heterozygous for the mys mutation (Fm7c males and females were discarded). Flies were raised on cornmeal, sugar, and yeast medium. Marker mutations are described in FlyBase (available on the World Wide Web) and described by Lindsley and Zimm (19Lindsley D.L. Zimm G.G. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 1992; 4: 1133Google Scholar). We have generated stable cell lines expressing more than 50 different function-altering mutations in the βPS integrin subunit. All of the mutant βPS integrin subunits were labeled with a Myc tag inserted into the large serine-rich loop (present only in the Drosophila βPS subunit) that is located between the X and A strands of the Hybrid domain. To control for experiment-to-experiment variability over the 2 years that these experiments were performed, each group of cell lines being assayed for integrin expression and TWOW-1 binding always included line WT1 (wild type 1; expressing untagged βPS and αPS2C), and values were normalized to its levels. The level of TWOW-1 used in all binding assays was 40 μg/ml. For wild type PS2C integrins, this is a subsaturating concentration resulting in ∼50% of the binding levels seen for integrins activated with Mn2+ (7Bunch T.A. Helsten T.L. Kendall T.L. Shirahatti N. Mahadevan D. Shattil S.J. Brower D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5050-5057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). At this concentration, we are able to detect both increases and decreases in affinity. Variability in integrin expression levels and their ability to bind TWOW-1 is due to either the specific βPS mutant subunit being expressed or cell line variability. To determine cell line variability, we examined the integrin expression levels and TWOW-1 binding of 17 transformed cell lines expressing wild type PS2C integrins. Seven lines expressed untagged βPS, and 10 expressed Myc-tagged βPS. All lines also expressed the αPS2C integrin subunit. Fig. 1A demonstrates that independent cell lines transfected with wild type PS2C integrin transgenes express variable levels of cell surface integrin. The average levels are not significantly different between those lines expressing untagged or Myc-tagged βPS (p = 0.94). In contrast to the variable integrin expression levels, the amount of TWOW-1 bound per integrin shows much less variability (Fig. 1B). The range of TWOW-1 binding varies between 0.81 and 1.25 (mean = 1.08 ± 0.15) for the lines expressing untagged integrins and between 1.01 and 1.33 (mean = 1.15 ± 0.11) for tagged integrins, relative to that observed for WT1. Mn2+ activates the affinity of PS2C integrins for TWOW-1 (7Bunch T.A. Helsten T.L. Kendall T.L. Shirahatti N. Mahadevan D. Shattil S.J. Brower D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5050-5057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). For untagged and tagged integrins, levels of TWOW-1 binding in the absence of Mn2+ were 44 ± 10 and 42 ± 14%, respectively, of that measured in the presence of Mn2+. These data demonstrate that the presence of the 15-amino acid Myc-tag in the serine-rich loop does not alter the ligand binding ability of the PS2C integrin or its affinity modulation by Mn2+. Second, the data demonstrate that line-to-line variability is to be expected for expression levels but not for TWOW-1 binding normalized to PS2C integrin expression levels. As with different cell lines expressing wild type PS2C integrins, expression levels of cell lines expressing mutant integrins vary widely (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table S1). Only three mutants, mysXN101(C629S;C549), mysb47(A293T;A225), and mysG12(D356N;D288), expressed levels of integrins 2 S.D. values below the average of the wild type lines. mysXN101 was already known to be poorly expressed in flies, whereas mysb47 and mysG12 did not show reduction in expression upon limited examination in either wing discs or muscle attachment sites (5Bunch T.A. Salatino R. Engelsgjerd M.C. Mukai L. West R.F. Brower D.L. Genetics. 1992; 132: 519-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Jannuzi A.L. Bunch T.A. West R.F. Brower D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3829-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Jannuzi A.L. Bunch T.A. Brabant M.C. Miller S.W. Mukai L. Zavortink M. Brower D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1352-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To ensure that low expression of mysb47(A293T;A225) and mysG12(D356N;D288) was not due to line-to-line variability, a second stably transformed line was obtained and tested. Again, both showed dramatically reduced PS2 integrin staining (supplemental Table S1). The extremely low levels of expression of the lethal mutation mysG12(D356N;D288) and the viable mysb47(A293T;A225) are consistent with observations of mutations of β1 amino acids Asp-295 (Asp-288) and Asp-233 (adjacent to β1 Ala-234; β3 Ala-225). Both of these were poorly expressed on the surface of the cell and appeared to be defective in α/β association (20Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure (supplemental Fig. S1), Asp-288 hydrogen-bonds with Leu-258, which is itself hydrogen-bonded to αIIb Tyr-237. Leu-258 is in the 310 helix that contains other residues interacting with the α subunit, including Asp-259, Arg-261, and Leu-262. Mutation of Asp-288 may therefore affect not only Leu-258 but other nearby α/β contacts as well. Finally, Asp-288 is immediately followed by helix α5, which contains Ser-291 and Glu-297, which are within 3 Å of αIIb. The effect of mysb47(A293T;A225) is less direct. Ala-225 is closest to (within 3.5 Å of) Leu-117, which contacts (within 3 Å) Val-247 and Thr-249 in β4, which precedes the β4–310 helix loop containing the close α/β contact Lys-253. Mutation of alanine to threonine probably alters the positioning of β4-310 helix loop and α/β contacts. Mutation of Cys-549 in β3 integrin (corresponding to mysXN101) showed reduced expression (21Mor-Cohen R. Rosenberg N. Peretz H. Landau M. Coller B.S. Awidi A. Seligsohn U. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 98: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cys-549 stabilizes a loop in I-EGF3 that contacts the Hybrid domain in the closed conformation of β3 integrin (supplemental Fig. S1C), and its mutation activates the integrin. This activation probably alters the position of the Hybrid domain and breaks the hydrogen bond between α subunit (Asp-319) and the β Hybrid domain (Leu-362). Additional separation of the α and β leg regions due to Hybrid swing-out may also be an additional consequence (22Zhu J. Luo B.H. Barth P. Schonbrun J. Baker D. Springer T.A. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 234-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Failure of these associations are the likely causes of poor α/β association. Ligand binding assays with the lethal mysG12 mutant were inconsistent between separate lines, due to the extremely low levels of expression, and we therefore do not report this. mysb47(A293T;A225) and mysXN101(C629S;C549), although also expressed at very low levels, gave very consistent ligand binding data, and these are presented but should also be viewed with more caution than the data from the other mutants. Finally, we have done duplicate transformations of some mutant integrins that expressed at or more than 2 S.D. values lower than wild type levels, and most again expressed at levels between 1 and 2 S.D. values below wild type, which suggests that they too may affect expression levels to some extent (supplemental Table S1). The affinity for the soluble monovalent ligand, TWOW-1, of PS2C integrins with different mutant βPS subunits was examined and compared with that of wild type integrins expressed on 10 independent cell lines. Results of this assay are arranged in order of binding ability in Fig. 3A (and supplemental Table S2). Of the 51 mutants generated in genetic screens, five displayed severely reduced binding levels that were more than 8 S.D. values below the mean of the wild type integrins (z score <−8). Seventeen lines showed no significant changes in TWOW-1 binding. Twenty-two of the mutant integrins displayed increased binding with z scores greater than 5, and an additional seven bound with z scores of 2.4–5.0. In addition to comparing ligand binding levels of mutant integrins normalized to the amount of integrin on the surface, we also compared their activation indexes (supplemental Table S2, column I). The activation index is the binding of TWOW-1 in the absence of Mn2+ divided by the binding in the presence of activating Mn2+. Although this approach removes the dependence on an antibody to measure surface integrin levels, it has its own limitations, including the observation that effects of mutants and Mn2+ can be additive (7Bunch T.A. Helsten T.L. Kendall T.L. Shirahatti N. Mahadevan D. Shattil S.J. Brower D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5050-5057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and mutants may influence the ability of Mn2+ to activate the integrins. For the mutants we analyzed, the activation index data give almost identical results as binding normalized to integrin levels. Of the 22 strongly activating mutants (z scores above 5), only two did not give similarly significant z scores when normalized by Mn2+-activated values (supplemental Table S2). The remaining two strongly activating mutants and six of the seven moderately activating (z scores 2.4–4.9) did not show significant activation index increases due to the mutations increasing binding both in the absence and in the presence of Mn2+ to similar extents. Examination of the overall distribution of the mutations within the βPS subunit and their effects on ligand binding is interesting (Fig. 3B and summarized in Table 1). All mutations that reduce ligand binding are found in the I domain and specifically in the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) and synergistic metal binding site (SyMBS). This confirms the previously recognized importance of these domains in ligand binding. Mutations that increase ligand binding are distributed in all domains, illustrating the importance of all domains in restraining the integrin in the low affinity (bent, head closed) conformation (Fig. 3C). Activating mutations are postulated to disrupt this conformation and push the equilibrium toward the unbent and/or head open conformations that result in increased affinity for ligand (Fig. 3C; reviewed in Refs. 2Shattil S.J.

In the following sections, we group the mutations by the domains they are likely to affect and discuss the probable consequences for integrin structures. Supplemental figures are provided for each set of mutants that focus on their positions and interactions with important structural components (supplemental Figs. S1–S9). The three mutations in the PSI domain that disrupt disulfide bridges, mysb3(C58S;C26;z = 6.7), mysb68(C58Y;C26;z = 7.9), mysb41(C40Y;C5;z = 8.7) activate the integrins. mysb3 and mysb68 both mutate the same cysteine residue and have similar effects on activating the integrin. Cys-26 is located between Trp-25 and Ser-27 that along with Glu-29 and Arg-37 are at the interface with the I-EGF1 domain residues Gly-458 and Cys-457 (supplemental Fig. S2). One of these I-EGF1 residues is mutated in mysb63(G531D;G458;z = 4.6) and is also activating (see “I-EGF Domain Mutants”). It is likely that defects in all three of these mutants perturb the PSI-I-EGF1 interaction. Activating mysb41(C40Y;C5;z = 8.7) probably disrupts PSI-Hybrid interactions. In β2 integrin, the Cys-3 residue (Cys-5 in β3) is adjacent to Thr-4 (Thr-6 in β3) that has been implicated in restraining the activation state of the integrin (23Zang Q. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6922-6929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Also in β2, Cys-3 (Cys-5) forms a disulfide bridge with Cys-21 (Cys-23), which is part of the PSI-Hybrid interaction domain (24Shi M. Sundramurthy K. Liu B. Tan S.M. Law S.K. Lescar J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30586-30593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In β3, Cys-23 forms a hydrogen bond with Hybrid residue Arg-93 (supplemental Fig. S2). Breaking of this disulfide bridge in mysb41 probably alters the position of Thr-6 and Cys-23 and thereby weakens the PSI-Hybrid interaction. Integrin crystal structures suggest that the PSI domain is important in stabilizing the Hybrid-I-EGF1 connections. This could be important for restraining the"

It consists of two UBL domains with a short linker between them. The covalent attachment of ISG15 to host and viral proteins to modify their functions, similar to ubiquitylation, is named ISGylation. Influenza B virus NS1B protein antagonizes human but not mouse ISGylation because NS1B exhibits species specificity; it only binds human and non-human primate ISG15. Previous studies have demonstrated that the N-terminal UBL domain and linker of ISG15 are required for the binding by NS1B and that the linker plays a large role in the species specificity, but the structural basis for them has not been elucidated. Here we report the crystal structure of human ISG15 in complex with NS1B at a resolution of 2.0 Å. A loop in the ISG15 N-terminal UBL domain inserts into a pocket in the NS1B dimer, forming a high affinity binding site. The nonspecific van der Waals contacts around the ISG15 linker form a low affinity site for NS1B binding. However, sequence alignment reveals that residues in the high affinity site are highly conserved in primate and non-primate ISG15. We propose that the low affinity binding around the ISG15 linker is important for the initial contact with NS1B and that the stable complex formation is largely contributed by the following high affinity interactions between ISG15 N-terminal UBL domain and NS1B.

One of the most prominent ISGs to be induced during viral infection and the ensuing type I interferon response is the ∼15-kDa protein ISG15. It is a member of the ubiquitin-like (UBL) protein family, which is covalently attached to target proteins to modify their functions (4Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol.

ISG15 and its mutants with an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag were collected with glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) followed by digestion with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) to remove the tag and further purification by Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration (GE Healthcare). The N-terminal fragment of NS1B (residues 1–103) was expressed with the pET-22b vector in E. coli BL21 (DE3). NS1B with a C-terminal His6 tag was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin (Qiagen) followed by Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration (GE Healthcare). The purified ISG15 and NS1B were incubated on ice for 30 min, and the stable ISG15-NS1B complex was further purified by Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration (GE Healthcare). The ISG15-NS1B complex in the buffer containing 0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.5 m NaCl was concentrated to ∼20 mg/ml for initial screening of crystallization conditions. Crystals were grown at 18 °C by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method, using equal volumes of protein and crystallization solution over a 0.6-ml reservoir composed of 20% PEG 8000, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.01 m succinic acid. Crystals were cryoprotected in well solution plus 20% (v/v) glycerol and then flash-frozen in the liquid nitrogen before data collection. A 2.0 Å dataset was collected on beamline BL17U at the Shanghai Synchrotron Research Facility (SSRF) and processed with HKL2000 (17Otwinowski Z. Borek D. Majewski W. Minor W. Acta Crystallogr.

Size-exclusion chromatography with a Superdex 200 10/300 column on an ÄKTA FPLC (GE Healthcare) was carried out to access the apparent molecular mass of the ISG15-NS1B complex in solution at 4 °C. The column was equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.15 m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The ISG15-NS1B complex with a starting concentration of ∼10 mg/ml (0.5-ml volume) was loaded to the column, and fractions of 0.5 ml each were collected. The fraction corresponding to the peak of the ISG15-NS1B complex elution (0.5 -ml volume) was loaded again to the column. The same analysis was performed two more times until the UV280 absorbance of the peak went down to ∼20 milliabsorbance units. Aliquots of fractions from all four gel filtration analyses were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The column was calibrated with molecular mass standards. Real-time binding and the following analysis by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) were carried out on a BIAcore T100 instrument (GE Healthcare) at 25 °C. The NS1B protein was immobilized on a research-grade CM5 sensor chip by the amine-coupling method. Flow cell 1 was left blank as a reference. NS1B (10 μg/ml) in sodium acetate buffer (10 mm, pH 5.0) was immobilized to 300–400 response units on the flow cell, and the surface was then blocked with an injection of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.0, for 7 min. An injection of 10 mm NaOH for 10 s was carried out to remove non-covalently bound NS1B. For the collection of data for kinetic or equilibrium analyses, ISG15 and all its mutants in a buffer of 0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.2, and 0.5 m NaCl, plus 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20, were injected over the flow cells at various concentrations at a 30 μl/min flow rate. The ISG15-NS1B complex was allowed to associate for 60 s and dissociate for 120 s. Data were analyzed with the BIAcore T100 evaluation software by fitting to a 1:1 Langmuir binding fitting model. The ISG15-NS1B complex structure was determined by the molecular replacement method and refined at 2.0 Å with a final Rwork and Rfree of 18.9 and 24.3%, respectively (Table 1). The asymmetric unit contains one NS1B molecule and one ISG15 molecule (Fig. 1A). By applying symmetrical operation, two NS1B monomers (A and B) form a closely packed homodimeric six-helix fold (Fig. 1B), which has the same architecture as unbound NS1B dimer structure previously determined (supplemental Fig. S1A) (18Yin C. Khan J.A. Swapna G.V. Ertekin A. Krug R.M. Tong L. Montelione G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20584-20592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The NS1B dimer binds two ISG15 molecules symmetrically (Fig. 1B). The gel filtration analysis showed that the NS1B exists as dimer (molecular mass 25.4 kDa) in solution (Fig. 1C). To examine the binding stoichiometry of the NS1B dimer with ISG15 in solution, we performed gel filtration analyses of the ISG15-NS1B complex four times from high to low protein concentration, which was facilitated by repeatedly loading the peak fraction of previous ISG15-NS1B elution to the column. With a starting concentration of ∼10 mg/ml, the peak volume of the ISG15-NS1B complex is 14.9 ml (Fig. 1C) in the first run. The elution volume of the ISG15-NS1B complex decreased to 15.3 and 15.7 ml in the second and third run (Fig. 1C). In the fourth run, the peak volume did not decrease and remained to be 15.7 ml (Fig. 1C). The molecular mass standards BSA (66 kDa) and ovalbumin (44 kDa) have peak volumes of 14.6 and 15.7 ml, respectively, indicating that the molecular mass of the ISG15-NS1B complex changed from close to 66 to 44 kDa with decreased protein concentration. The calculated molecular mass of the NS1B dimer bound with two ISG15 molecules including extra residues after PreScission cleavage and His6 tag is 60.8 kDa. The calculated molecular mass of the NS1B dimer bound with one ISG15 molecule is 43.1 kDa. These results collectively indicate that in solution, the NS1B dimer may bind two copies or one copy of ISG15, depending on the protein concentration.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsData collectionBeamlineSSRF BL17UWavelength0.9793Space groupC2Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)93.68, 39.15, 74.70α, β, γ (°)90, 90.5, 90Resolution (Å)50-2.00 (2.05-2.00)aValues in parentheses are for highest resolution shell.Rmerge (%)12.0 (32.3)Iσ/I14.4 (3.0)Completeness (%)91.5 (86.2)Redundancy4.0 (2.5)RefinementResolution (Å)46.8-2.00No. of reflections16316Rwork/Rfree (%)18.9/24.3No. of atomsProtein1950Water85Succinic acid2B-factors (Å2)Protein40.7Water42.6Succinic acid68.9r.m.s. deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.007Bond angles (°)1.045Ramachandran plotMost favored93.9Additionally allowed6.1Generously allowed0.0Disallowed0.0a Values in parentheses are for highest resolution shell. Open table in a new tab The overall structure of the NS1B monomer did not change substantially upon binding ISG15 when compared with unbound NS1B monomer (18Yin C. Khan J.A. Swapna G.V. Ertekin A.

However, there is a large conformational change of the C-terminal tail (residues 91–103) of NS1B in the complex to facilitate interactions with ISG15, which will be described below (supplemental Fig. S1B). The overall structure of ISG15, consisting of N- and C-terminal UBL domains and the linker between them, also did not change substantially upon binding NS1B when compared with free ISG15 (supplemental Fig. S1C) (8Narasimhan J. Wang M. Fu Z. Klein J.M. Haas A.L. Kim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27356-27365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The r.m.s. deviation for 152 Cα atoms is ∼0.82 Å. The N-terminal UBL domain and the following linker region of ISG15 have contact with the NS1B dimer in the complex (Fig. 1B), and the C-terminal UBL domain of ISG15 is away from the NS1B dimer without any interaction (Fig. 1B). This is consistent with previous studies showing the importance of the N-terminal UBL domain and linker region of human ISG15 in NS1B binding (7Versteeg G.A. Hale B.G. van Boheemen S. Wolff T. Lenschow D.J. García-Sastre A. J. Virol. 2010; 84: 5423-5430Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Sridharan H. Zhao C. Krug R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7852-7856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because the two binding interfaces between the NS1B dimer and two ISG15 molecules in the crystal structure are identical, we only analyze one interface in the following description and discussion. At the binding interface, a protruding loop (Met-9–Gly-12) from the ISG15 N-terminal UBL domain inserts into a pocket contributed by both NS1B monomers (Fig. 2A). At a 4 Å distance cutoff, residues Met-9, Leu-10, Ala-11, and Gly-12 from this loop have extensive interactions with residues Gln-37 and Ala-39 from NS1B monomer A and residues Ala-19, Met-84, Leu-88, Gly-99, Phe-100, and Pro-102 from NS1B monomer B (supplemental Table S1). The overall property of interactions in the pocket is hydrophobic. ISG15 residue Leu-10 is the central interacting residue in the pocket, which has interactions with Met-84, Leu-88, and Phe-100 of the NS1B monomer B and contributes to nearly 20% of the total buried surface upon complex formation (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S2A). Mutation of this residue (L10A) decreased the binding affinity with NS1B from 0.18 to 50 μm (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. S3). Other hydrophobic residues including Ile-36, Leu-72, Leu-73, Val-74, and Val-75 in the ISG15 N-terminal UBL domain also have contacts with NS1B at the binding interface (supplemental Table S1).TABLE 2Affinities of ISG15 wild type and its mutants binding to immobilized NS1BFit modelkon (mean ± S.D.)koff (mean ± S.D.)KD (mean ± S.D.)m−1s−1 × 105s−1 × 10−2μmWTKinetics1.6 ± 0.13.0 ± 0.20.18 ± 0.01L10ASteady state50 ± 13D76QSteady state6.2 ± 2.3K77NSteady state1.7 ± 0.6D79SKinetics2.2 ± 1.04.0 ± 0.20.20 ± 0.10D76Q/K77N/D79SSteady state5.2 Open table in a new tab The previously identified critical linker region (Asp-76–Asp-79) contacts the NS1B dimer at the binding interface (Fig. 2A) (7Versteeg G.A.

Replacing residues Asp-76, Lys-77, and Asp-79 in human ISG15 with corresponding mouse residues Gln, Asn, and Ser abolished the binding with NS1B in GST pulldown assay (15Sridharan H. Zhao C. Krug R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7852-7856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). At a 4 Å distance cutoff, residues Asp-76 and Lys-77 from ISG15 have contacts with Met-91 from NS1B monomer A and Trp-36 from NS1B monomer B (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S2B). The interactions are characterized by the van der Waals packing of side chains without specific hydrogen-bonding or salt bridge interactions (Fig. 2C). Residue Asp-79 does not interact with any NS1B residues (Fig. 2C). Our SPR analysis supports the structural characteristics, showing that single D76Q and K77N mutations decreased the NS1B binding affinity from 0.18 μm to 6.2 and 1.7 μm, respectively (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. S3). Mutant D79S still had a binding affinity of 0.20 μm, which is close to that of wild type ISG15 (0.18 μm) (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. S3). We also made a human ISG15 with a D76Q/K77N/D79S triple mutation, which induced the same level of affinity decrease (5.2 μm) as the single D76Q mutation (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. S3). In the ISG15-NS1B complex, the NS1B 1–103 fragment consists of three helices (α1, α2, and α3), two connecting loops (L1 and L2), and the N- and C-terminal tails (supplemental Fig. S4A). When compared with unbound NS1B, the C-terminal tail of NS1B in the complex has a close to 180° degree rotation (supplemental Fig. S1B), enabling residues on it to interact with ISG15. Among the 15 ISG15-interacting residues on NS1B, seven of them are located in the C-terminal tail including Met-91, Pro-93, Ser-94, Ile-97, Gly-99, Phe-100, and Gly-101 (supplemental Table S1), and Met-91 and Phe-100 are extensively involved in the hydrophobic interactions with the protruding ISG15 loop (Met-9–Gly-12) in the pocket (Fig. 2B). This explains the previous observation that both the RNA-binding domain (RBD, the N-terminal 93 residues) and the 94–103 region of NS1B are required for ISG15 binding (14Yuan W. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The NS1B RBD (residues 1–93) and corresponding influenza virus A NS1A RBD (1–73) share a similar homodimeric six-helix fold (18Yin C. Khan J.A. Swapna G.V. Ertekin A. Krug R.M. Tong L. Montelione G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20584-20592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the architecture, six helices α1, α2, α3, α1′, α2′, and α3′ are conserved in both length and position, whereas the L2 loop is eight amino acids longer in NS1B (supplemental Fig. S4A). The unique Arg-38–Arg-38 pair and two Arg-35–Arg-46 pairs in the NS1A RBD dimer for dsRNA binding are strictly conserved in the NS1B RBD (supplemental Fig. S4A) (23Cheng A. Wong S.M. Yuan Y.A. Cell Res. 2009; 19: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), indicating that the NS1B RBD binds dsRNA similarly as the NS1A RBD. The ISG15 and dsRNA binding sites are on different sides of the NS1B dimer, which is consistent with a previous study showing that dsRNA and ISG15 can bind to NS1B simultaneously (supplemental Fig. S5) (16Yuan W. Aramini J.M. Montelione G.T. Krug R.M. Virology. 2002; 304: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our mutagenesis and SPR analysis showed that mutation of Leu-10 in the ISG15 N-terminal UBL domain decreased the NS1B binding affinity close to 300-fold (Table 2), whereas mutation of residues in the ISG15 linker decreased the NS1B binding affinity 10–30-fold (Table 2). This indicates that the binding around the ISG15 linker by NS1B is weaker than the binding around the ISG15 N-terminal UBL domain by NS1B. However, the ISG15 linker plays a very significant role in the species-specific binding by NS1B (15Sridharan H. Zhao C. Krug R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7852-7856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment shows that hydrophobic ISG15 residues Met-9, Ile-10, Ile-36, Leu-72, Leu-73, Val-74, and Val-75 forming the high affinity binding site on the N-terminal UBL domain are highly conserved among primates and non-primates (supplemental Fig. S4B). Therefore, most probably the N-terminal UBL domain would not determine the species-specific binding by NS1B. These observations lead us to speculate that although the binding around the ISG15 linker by NS1B is relatively weak, it may provide contact to bring NS1B and ISG15 close, and then the high affinity binding between the ISG15 N-terminal UBL domain and NS1B may provide the following extensive interactions for stable complex formation. In this binding model, the initial contact of NS1B with the linker region of ISG15 is critical not only for bringing these two molecules close but also for positioning them in the appropriate orientation to facilitate extensive interactions between the ISG15 N-terminal UBL domain and NS1B. This also provides a structural basis for the species-specific binding of ISG15 by NS1B. The ISG15 C-terminal UBL has a C-terminal conserved LRLRGG motif that is covalently linked to target proteins (supplemental Fig. S4B). The ovarian tumor (OTU) domain proteases encoded by nairoviruses and arteriviruses help counteract both ubiquitylation and ISGylation by cleaving ubiquitin and ISG15 from target proteins (24Frias-Staheli N.

It supports the previous proposal that the N-terminal UBL domain of ISG15 mainly functions in the ligation step of ISGylation and that NS1B inhibits ISGylation by competing with E3 ligase for binding to the N-terminal UBL domain (9Chang Y.G.

https://openalex.org/W2090810225,"Background In this study, we performed a genome-wide search for effector genes bound by STOX1A, a winged helix transcription factor recently demonstrated to be involved in late onset Alzheimer's disease and affecting the amyloid processing pathway. Methodology/Principal Findings Our results show that out of 218 genes bound by STOX1A as identified by chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq), the serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 7 (SFRS7) was found to be induced, both at the mRNA and protein levels, by STOX1A after stable transfection in glial cells. The increase in SFRS7 was followed by an increase in the 4R/3R ratios of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) by differential exon 10 splicing. Secondly, STOX1A also induced expression of total tau both at the mRNA and protein levels. Upregulation of total tau expression (SFRS7-independent) and tau exon 10 splicing (SFRS7-dependent), as shown in this study to be both affected by STOX1A, is known to have implications in neurodegeneration. Conclusions Our data further supports the functional importance and central role of STOX1A in neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2038113383,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a poorly understood condition with greater than 30% mortality. Massive recruitment of neutrophils to the lung occurs in the initial stages of the ARDS. Significant variability in the severity and duration of ARDS-associated pulmonary inflammation could be linked to heterogeneity in the inflammatory capacity of neutrophils. Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are a broad gene family induced by Type I interferons. While ISGs are central to anti-viral immunity, the potential exists for these genes to evoke extensive modification in cellular response in other clinical settings. In this prospective study, we sought to determine if ISG expression in circulating neutrophils from ARDS patients is associated with changes in neutrophil function. Circulating neutrophil RNA was isolated, and hierarchical clustering ranked patients' expression of three ISGs. Neutrophil response to pathogenic bacteria was compared between normal and high ISG-expressing neutrophils. High neutrophil ISG expression was found in 25 of 95 (26%) of ARDS patients and was associated with reduced migration toward interleukin-8, and altered responses to Staphylococcus aureus, but not Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which included decreased p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation, superoxide anion release, interleukin-8 release, and a shift from necrotic to apoptotic cell death. These alterations in response were reflected in a decreased capacity to kill S. aureus, but not P. aeruginosa. Therefore, the ISG expression signature is associated with an altered circulating neutrophil response phenotype in ARDS that may predispose a large subgroup of patients to increased risk of specific bacterial infections."
https://openalex.org/W2043449690,"We employed budding yeast and skeletal muscle actin to examine the contribution of the actin isoform to myosin motor function. While yeast and muscle actin are highly homologous, they exhibit different charge density at their N termini (a proposed myosin-binding interface). Muscle myosin-II actin-activated ATPase activity is significantly higher with muscle versus yeast actin. Whether this reflects inefficiency in the ability of yeast actin to activate myosin is not known. Here we optimized the isolation of two yeast myosins to assess actin function in a homogenous system. Yeast myosin-II (Myo1p) and myosin-V (Myo2p) accommodate the reduced N-terminal charge density of yeast actin, showing greater activity with yeast over muscle actin. Increasing the number of negative charges at the N terminus of yeast actin from two to four (as in muscle) had little effect on yeast myosin activity, while other substitutions of charged residues at the myosin interface of yeast actin reduced activity. Thus, yeast actin functions most effectively with its native myosins, which in part relies on associations mediated by its outer domain. Compared with yeast myosin-II and myosin-V, muscle myosin-II activity was very sensitive to salt.

Actin is a highly abundant 43 kDa monomeric protein, highly conserved among eukaryotes, that reversibly polymerizes into filamentous actin (F-actin) 2The abbreviation used is: F-actinfilamentous actin. in a spatially and temporally regulated fashion. One of the major functions of F-actin, in both muscle and non-muscle cells, is to interact with the motor protein myosin to generate contractile force to power processes such as muscle contraction, cell movement, intracellular transport, and cytokinesis. filamentous actin. The myosin motors constitute a structurally and functionally complex family of proteins (1Sellers J.R. Myosins, Second Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar). However, a comparison of these proteins reveals a great degree of conservation in the motor domain. This region of the protein contains an ATP binding site, interacts with F-actin, and couples conformational changes with ATP hydrolysis to generate force via F-actin displacement. Formation of the actomyosin complex involves an initial weak ionic interaction, which transitions into a more hydrophobic, strong-bound state that is coupled with force generation. Actin is a clam-shaped protein with two domains that are joined by a hinge region (2Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). The smaller outer domain consists of subdomains 1 and 2, while the larger inner domain consists of subdomains 3 and 4 (Fig. 1A). Between the two domains exists a deep cleft in which sit an adenine nucleotide and a divalent cation to help hold the nucleotide in place. This nucleotide and cation are important for stability of the actin monomer, and the phosphorylation state of the nucleotide is an important determinant of filament stability. A number of studies have led to the conclusion that a major site of interaction of the myosin head with actin involves a substantial portion of actin subdomain 1 (3Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). One factor believed to be especially important in formation of the initial weak binding state is an ionic interaction between the acidic N-terminal finger of actin with a cationic loop (loop 2) separating the 50 and 20 kDa domains of the myosin head (Fig. 1, A and B). A number of studies support such a model. For example, interaction of these two elements were directly demonstrated by chemical crosslinking (4Bertrand R. Chaussepied P. Kassab R. Boyer M. Roustan C. Benyamin Y. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5728-5736Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 5Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4800-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1579-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Blocking the N terminus with an antibody directed against the N-terminal seven residues adversely affects this interaction (7DasGupta G. Reisler E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8DasGupta G. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1836-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and substitution of the acidic N-terminal residues in Dictyostelium actin with histidines has the same effect (9Sutoh K. Ando M. Sutoh K. Toyoshima Y.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 7711-7714Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Other negatively charged surface residues from subdomain 1 of actin are also important for the initial weak-bound actomyosin state. Substitution of either of two conserved charged pairs of residues (D24/D25 and E99/E100 in budding yeast actin, Fig. 1, A and B) with alanines or histidines leads to a loss in skeletal muscle myosin-II activity (10Johara M. Toyoshima Y.Y. Ishijima A. Kojima H. Yanagida T. Sutoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 2127-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 11Miller C.J. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2694-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Miller C.J. Wong W.W. Bobkova E. Rubenstein P.A. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16557-16565Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Such substitutions lead to a significant reduction in actomyosin affinity in the presence of ATP, without having any effect on strong actin binding (i.e. in the absence of ATP) (11Miller C.J. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2694-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Budding yeast actin will only activate the ATPase activity of skeletal muscle myosin subfragment 1 (S1) about one-tenth as well as skeletal muscle actin (13Cook R.K. Root D. Miller C. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2410-2415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), despite the fact that their sequences are 87% identical. A difference in the number of N-terminal negative residues between these two actins seems to play a significant role in this activation. Yeast actin has only two N-terminal acidic residues while striated muscle actins have four, and higher eukaryotic non-muscle actins have three (Fig. 1B). Substitution of the yeast N terminus with four acidic residues generated a mutant actin (4Ac) that reduced this 10-fold difference in ATPase activation to 3-fold (13Cook R.K. Root D. Miller C. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2410-2415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was further demonstrated that three negative charges seemed to be as good as four in stimulating this activity (13Cook R.K. Root D. Miller C. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2410-2415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another question concerning the actomyosin interaction is to what extent, if any, the inner domain of actin can influence the conformation of subdomain 1 (either through the hinge region or the nucleotide bridge), in affecting the interaction of the two proteins. To address this question, we previously generated a hybrid actin (sub12) in which we used site-directed mutagenesis to cumulatively introduce muscle actin-specific residues into the corresponding positions of yeast actin in subdomains 1 and 2 (14McKane M. Wen K.K. Meyer A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29916-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Our results with this actin demonstrated that despite the fact that the outer domain should have constituted a normal binding surface for muscle actin, the hybrid still acted like yeast actin in its ability to activate muscle myosin ATPase activity. This hybrid actin produced an adverse phenotype in yeast expressing it as the only actin in the cell. Furthermore, it has been shown that striated actin is not compatible with yeast viability (15Karlsson R. Aspenström P. Byström A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 213-217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that a mammalian non-muscle actin, although it will rescue a lethal actin-null phenotype in yeast, produces at best a very sick cell (15Karlsson R. Aspenström P. Byström A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 213-217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results raise the question of to what extent yeast myosins may have evolved to specifically utilize yeast actin and, in particular, how they compensate for the reduced negative N-terminal charge density on yeast actin. In this study, we have utilized two myosins isolated from budding yeast to address these questions. Myo1p (referred to as Sc-MyoII from here on in) is a conventional class II, double-headed myosin (16Fang X. Luo J. Nishihama R. Wloka C. Dravis C. Travaglia M. Iwase M. Vallen E.A. Bi E. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 1333-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Watts F.Z. Miller D.M. Orr E. Nature. 1985; 316: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Watts F.Z. Shiels G. Orr E. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3499-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) that localizes to the division site (bud neck) where it participates in retrograde flow of actin cables (19Huckaba T.M. Lipkin T. Pon L.A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 957-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and contractile ring function during cytokinesis (20Bi E. Maddox P. Lew D.J. Salmon E.D. McMillan J.N.

Myo2p (referred to as Sc-MyoV from here on in) is an unconventional class V, double-headed myosin (22Dunn B.D. Sakamoto T. Hong M.S. Sellers J.R. Takizawa P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 1193-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Johnston G.C. Prendergast J.A. Singer R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) that transports various cargoes along actin cables toward sites of polarized growth (24Pruyne D. Legesse-Miller A. Gao L. Dong Y. Bretscher A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 559-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). We assessed the activation of Sc-MyoII, Sc-MyoV, and skeletal muscle myosin-II by yeast (wild-type and mutant forms) and skeletal muscle actin in terms of solution ATPase activity and the ability to move actin filaments in the in vitro motility assay. Our results demonstrate markedly different responses of the myosins to the actin variants utilized, implying a significant difference in the modes of actomyosin binding in muscle and yeast. Standard budding yeast growth conditions and genetic methods were employed (25Rose M.D. Winston F. Heiter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Sc-MyoII and Sc-MyoV overexpression strains (GAL1prom-MYO1 and GAL1prom-MYO2) utilized a DNA fragment encoding a nourseothricin (nat) resistance marker and the GAL1 galactose-inducible promoter. The cassette was amplified from pFA6a-natR-GAL1, purified, and integrated into the genome of a wild-type (or MYO2-GFP:HIS3/MYO2-GFP:HIS3 leu2/leu2 ura3/ura3 his3/his3) diploid immediately upstream of MYO1 or MYO2 by homologous recombination (using primers containing 40 bp of flanking DNA specific to the relevant locus) (26Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4171) Google Scholar). The C-terminal GFP tag favored tethering of active Sc-MyoV motors in motility assays; no difference in activity was observed in ATPase assays for Sc-MyoV-GFP versus untagged Sc-MyoV. nat-resistant strains carrying the desired integration were confirmed by morphological phenotypes associated with Sc-MyoII and Sc-MyoV overexpression and diagnostic PCRs of genomic DNA. Construction of the pGST-CMD1 calmodulin overexpression plasmid was previously described (27Lord M. Sladewski T.E. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8014-8019Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This plasmid has a pRS316 (URA3) backbone, expressing GST-tagged calmodulin from a GAL1 promoter. CMD1 was replaced with MLC1 or MLC2 to generate pGST-MLC1 and pGST-MLC2. MLC1 primers: 5′ NotI GCGGCCGCATGTCAGCCACCAGAGCCAATAAAG; 3′ SalI GTCGACTCATTGTCTCAAAACATCTTCGATG. MLC2 primers: 5′ NotI GCGGCCGCATGGACCATAGTGAATCGCTAACG; 3′ SalI GTCGACTTAATCGGTGATTGAATCTAAGAAAAGC. The pFA6a-natR-GAL1 plasmid was constructed by replacing the nmt41 promoter of pFA6a-natR-nmt41prom (28Sladewski T.E. Previs M.J. Lord M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 3941-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with the GAL1 promoter fragment. The yeast haploid strains expressing either 4Ac, sub12, D24A-D25A, or E99A-E100A mutant actins have been described previously (11Miller C.J. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2694-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Cook R.K. Root D. Miller C. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 29916-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant yeast actins in the Ca2+ monomeric form were purified by a DNase I affinity and DEAE ion exchange chromatography as described previously (29Cook R.K. Blake W.T. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9430-9436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). G actin concentrations were determined by UV absorbance at 290 nm using the extinction coefficient ϵ = 25.6 mm−1·cm−1, and actin was stored in G buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm DTT) at 4 °C and used within 5 days. Chicken skeletal muscle actin was purified from acetone powder as previously described (30Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Four liters of the GAL1p-MYO1 strain (two liters harboring pGST-MLC1, two liters harboring pGST-MLC2) or four liters of the GAL1p-MYO2 strain (two liters harboring pGST-CMD1, two liters harboring pGST-MLC1) were grown in CSM-Ura− with 1% raffinose as the sole carbon source. After the OD595 reached 1.0, cells were induced by the addition of 2% galactose and allowed to grow for an additional 16 h. GAL1p-MYO1 and GAL1p-MYO2 cells were harvested separately via centrifugation and cell pellets were washed in water and resuspended 1:1 in lysis buffer (750 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 4 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 20 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm PMSF, 2 mm benzamidine hydrochloride hydrate, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and lysed using a FastPrep-24 (MP Biomedicals). GST-tagged light chains (along with the co-purifying heavy chains) were recovered from lysates using glutathione-Sepharose resin and dialyzed into A15 buffer (500 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole pH 7.2, 0.375 mm sodium azide, and 1 mm DTT). Light chains over-expressed to greater extent than heavy chains. The concentration of motors was estimated by densitometry of Coomassie-stained heavy chain bands after SDS-PAGE using rabbit skeletal muscle myosin as the standard. Typical yields were ∼150 μg (Sc-MyoII) and ∼50 μg (Sc-MyoV). Actin-activated ATPase assays were carried out at room temperature in 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mm imidazole, 50–175 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 1 mm DTT with 20 nm Sc-MyoII, 3 nm Sc-MyoV, or 50 nm skeletal muscle myosin-II and 0–100 μm actin filaments. Malachite green was used to quantitate Pi release (31Henkel R.D. VandeBerg J.L. Walsh R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Background ATP hydrolysis from actin (detected in controls lacking myosin) and basal myosin activity (detected in controls lacking actin) were subtracted when deriving actin-activated ATPase rates. Curves were fit to Michaelis-Menten kinetics using the GraphPad Prism software (v5.0b). Myosin heavy chain quantitation (described above) enabled VMAX values to be determined for Sc-MyoII and Sc-MyoV. We used motility assays (32Kron S.J. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 6272-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar) with 40 μg/ml of myosin applied to the motility chambers. Fluorescent actin stocks were prepared at 5 μm from G-actin stocks, polymerized by the addition of 50 mm KCl and 1 mm MgCl2 in the presence of 5 μm rhodamine phalloidin (Invitrogen) for 30 min. Sc-MyoII, Sc-MyoV, or skeletal muscle myosin-II were adhered to the surface of a nitrocellulose-coated coverslip for 10 min and the chamber was then washed as follows: (a) three times with motility buffer (25 mm imidazole pH 7.4, 50–150 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT) plus 0.5 mg/ml BSA; (b) three times with motility buffer; (c) twice with motility buffer containing vortexed (1 min) unlabeled actin filaments (1 μm); (d) three times with motility buffer plus 1 mm ATP; (e) twice with motility buffer plus 25 nm rhodamine phalloidin-labeled actin filaments and oxygen scavengers (50 μg/ml catalase, 130 μg/ml glucose oxidase, and 3 mg/ml glucose); (f) twice with motility buffer plus 20 mm DTT, 0.5% methyl-cellulose and oxygen scavengers; and (g) twice with motility buffer plus 20 mm DTT, 0.5% methyl-cellulose, 1.5 mm ATP, and oxygen scavengers. Filaments were observed at room temperature by epifluorescnece microscopy on a Nikon TE2000-E2 inverted microscope with a Plan Apo 60 (1.45 NA) objective (Melville, NY). Fluorescence utilized an EXFO X-CITE 120 illuminator (Nikon). NIS Elements software was used to control the microscope (Nikon), two Uniblitz shutters (Vincent Associates, Rochester, NY), and a Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ2 14-bit camera (Tucson, AZ) were used to record time-lapse images at 2 s intervals for 1 min. ImageJ software with the MTrackJ plug-in was used to calculate filament velocities from the time-lapse series. Budding yeast actin has only two N-terminal acidic residues compared with the three or four found on higher eukaryotic actins which are believed to be important for the initial weak interaction between actin and myosin. The focus of this paper was to determine, using purified myosins, if myosins from budding yeast compensate for this reduced N-terminal acidic charge density on yeast actin. Previous studies had used small amounts of these myosins isolated in quantities sufficient for in vitro motility assays (19Huckaba T.M. Lipkin T. Pon L.A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 957-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 22Dunn B.D. Sakamoto T. Hong M.S. Sellers J.R. Takizawa P.A. J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1121-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), but this is the first report of a procedure for preparing active Sc-MyoII (Myo1p) and Sc-MyoV (Myo2p) in amounts sufficient for ATPase analysis. We isolated the full-length proteins from yeast extracts (Fig. 2) by pulling them down with overexpressed GST-tagged myosin light chains using glutathione Sepharose resin. As we previously reported for budding yeast myosin-I (27Lord M. Sladewski T.E. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8014-8019Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), isolation required co-overexpression of both heavy chain and light chains since isolation of over-expressed light chains (calmodulin, Mlc1p, or Mlc2p) alone failed to co-purify any detectable myosin activity in actin-activated ATPase or motility assays. We also generally observed that overexpression of Sc-MyoII was much better than Sc-MyoV for reasons we do not understand. Both Sc-MyoII and Sc-MyoV samples exhibited robust motor activity as measured by actin-activated ATPase and in vitro motility assays (Table 1). One-step purified myosins were employed since any attempt to further purify these low-yield samples typically resulted in loss of heavy chain and motor activity.TABLE 1Summary of Sc-MyoII and Sc-MyoV ATPase and motility activities with muscle and yeast actinsSc-MyoII (Myo1p)Sc-MyoV (Myo2p)VMAXaVMAX and Km (±S.E.) calculated by fitting actin-activated ATPase data (from Figs. 3A and 4A) to the Michaelis-Menten equation.

Open table in a new tab Our previous work demonstrated that yeast actin was only one-tenth as active in stimulating skeletal muscle myosin S1 ATPase activity as was muscle actin (13Cook R.K. Root D. Miller C. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2410-2415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if this relative ability changed with yeast myosins, we assayed the actin-activated ATPase activity of both Sc-MyoII and Sc-MyoV in the presence of either yeast or skeletal muscle actin. The results demonstrate a number of interesting findings. First, for Sc-MyoII, the VMAX and catalytic efficiency were significantly higher for yeast than for muscle actin (Fig. 3A, Table 1) suggesting co-adaptation of the two proteins for optimal function in yeast. For Sc-MyoV the results were more complicated. There was a significantly higher VMAX with yeast versus muscle actin (Fig. 4A; Table 1). However, it was offset by a higher Km (i.e. a lower apparent actin affinity) for the yeast actin, leading to near equal catalytic efficiencies for the two actins (Table 1). The other observation was that in terms of VMAX and catalytic efficiency, the Sc-MyoV values (with either actin) were >10-fold and 7–20-fold higher, respectively, than those for Sc-MyoII (Table 1).FIGURE 4Budding yeast myosin-V motor activities with yeast and muscle actin isoforms. Sc-MyoV motor activity was measured using ATPase and in vitro motility assays with muscle, yeast, and mutant yeast actins. A, actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity was measured as a function of actin concentration (yeast, muscle, and the yeast 4Ac mutant). Plots were generated from average values obtained from 3–4 different datasets using at least two independent preparations of Sc-MyoV and the actins. Curves were fit using Michaelis-Menten kinetics. B, actin-activated ATPase data comparing average Sc-MyoV motor activity with 25 μm yeast, muscle, and mutant 4Ac and sub12 yeast actins (n = 3). The difference between the values for wild-type yeast (or 4Ac) and muscle (or sub12) actin are significant (p < 0.0001). C, a comparison of the average actin filament gliding rates for Sc-MyoV from in vitro motility assays using yeast, muscle, and mutant yeast actins (n = 20–40).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previously, we demonstrated that addition of two negative charges to the N terminus of yeast actin (4Ac actin) increased its ability to activate muscle myosin. With the yeast myosins, however, we observed markedly different results. Because of limitations in available 4Ac actin, we carried out a more limited kinetic analysis preventing calculation of VMAX and Km values. However, for each of the 4Ac actin concentrations tested, the Sc-Myoll ATPase activity was virtually identical to that observed with wild-type yeast actin (Fig. 3, A and B). This result demonstrated a decreased dependence of Sc-MyoII on the negative charge density of the actin N terminus compared with muscle myosin. With Sc-MyoV, the extra negative charge had no significant effect on the ability of yeast actin to activate the myosin (Fig. 4, A and B), again demonstrating a decreased reliance on an ionic interaction between the actin N terminus and myosin in the yeast system. Another way of assessing actomyosin function is to measure the rate of movement of a fluorescently labeled actin filament over a lawn of myosin heads attached to the surface of a microscope coverslip. We thus applied this assay to the two yeast myosins in the presence of different actins. As shown for Sc-MyoII (Fig. 3C; Table 1), motility with yeast actin is significantly faster than with muscle actin, although the relative difference is less than seen in the solution ATPase assays. Here, the 4Ac actin supported a Sc-MyoII motility rate that was closer to that of muscle (Fig. 3C; Table 1). With Sc-MyoV, the motility observed was basically the same for yeast, muscle, and 4Ac actins (Fig. 4C; Table 1) demonstrating again, a decreased reliance on actin N-terminal negative charge density for yeast myosin activation. However, the relatively slow rate of Sc-MyoV motility (compared with its ATPase) suggests that the duty ratio of this motor probably has a significant impact on functional output in this assay (see “Discussion”). We next tested the ability of the mutant yeast actin with muscle-like substitutions in subdomains 1 and 2 (sub12) to support Sc-MyoII and Sc-MyoV activity. As with muscle actin, sub12 actin supported Sc-MyoII and Sc-MyoV ATPase activities that were significantly lower than with wild-type yeast actin (Figs. 3B and 4B). Again, similar to muscle actin, sub12 actin supported a Sc-MyoII motility rate that was significantly lower than wild-type yeast actin (Fig. 3C; Table 1). The motility rate of Sc-MyoV with sub12 actin, if anything, appeared slightly slower than with wild-type yeast, 4Ac, and muscle actins (Fig. 4C; Table 1). Taken together, while the muscle-like 4Ac mutant actin appears more like wild-type yeast actin in its ability to support Sc-MyoII and Sc-MyoV activity, the yeast muscle hybrid sub12 actin appears more like muscle. We compared the activity of Sc-MyoII and Sc-MyoV with muscle myosin-II using yeast and muscle actins. Myosin activity was assayed at different salt concentrations to assess the importance of ionic interactions in establishing functional actomyosin complexes. In agreement with our earlier observations (Figs. 3A and 4A) Sc-MyoII and Sc-MyoV showed greater ATPase activity throughout with yeast versus muscle actin (Fig. 5, A and B). The salt sensitivity of Sc-MyoII ATPase activity (Fig. 5A) fell between the insensitivity exhibited by Sc-MyoV (Fig. 5B) and the extreme sensitivity of muscle myosin-II (Fig. 5C). Sc-MyoII activity showed an ∼1.5-fold greater sensitivity to salt with muscle actin (yeast actin IC50: 184 mm KCl, muscle actin IC50: 125 mm KCl; Fig. 5A, inset). In contrast, increasing the salt in motility assays w"
https://openalex.org/W2028112607,"Background Dendritic cells (DCs) not only play a crucial role in activating immune cells but also suppressing them. We recently investigated SHIP's role in murine DCs in terms of immune cell activation and found that TLR agonist-stimulated SHIP−/− GM-CSF-derived DCs (GM-DCs) were far less capable than wild type (WT, SHIP+/+) GM-DCs at activating T cell proliferation. This was most likely because SHIP−/− GM-DCs could not up-regulate MHCII and/or co-stimulatory receptors following TLR stimulation. However, the role of SHIP in DC-induced T cell suppression was not investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we examined SHIP's role in DC-induced T cell suppression by co-culturing WT and SHIP−/− murine DCs, derived under different conditions or isolated from spleens, with αCD3+ αCD28 activated WT T cells and determined the relative suppressive abilities of the different DC subsets. We found that, in contrast to SHIP+/+ and −/− splenic or Flt3L-derived DCs, which do not suppress T cell proliferation in vitro, both SHIP+/+ and −/− GM-DCs were capable of potently suppressing T cell proliferation. However, WT GM-DC suppression appeared to be mediated, at least in part, by nitric oxide (NO) production while SHIP−/− GM-DCs expressed high levels of arginase 1 and did not produce NO. Following exhaustive studies to ascertain the mechanism of SHIP−/− DC-mediated suppression, we could conclude that cell-cell contact was required and the mechanism may be related to their relative immaturity, compared to SHIP+/+ GM-DCs. Conclusions These findings suggest that although both SHIP+/+ and −/− GM-DCs suppress T cell proliferation, the mechanism(s) employed are different. WT GM-DCs suppress, at least in part, via IFNγ-induced NO production while SHIP−/− GM-DCs do not produce NO and suppression can only be alleviated when contact is prevented."
