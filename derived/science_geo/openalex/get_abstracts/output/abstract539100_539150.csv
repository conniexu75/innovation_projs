https://openalex.org/W2100039832,"Failure of T cells to protect against cancer is thought to result from lack of antigen recognition, chronic activation, and/or suppression by other cells. Using a mouse sarcoma model, we show that glucose consumption by tumors metabolically restricts T cells, leading to their dampened mTOR activity, glycolytic capacity, and IFN-γ production, thereby allowing tumor progression. We show that enhancing glycolysis in an antigenic ""regressor"" tumor is sufficient to override the protective ability of T cells to control tumor growth. We also show that checkpoint blockade antibodies against CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1, which are used clinically, restore glucose in tumor microenvironment, permitting T cell glycolysis and IFN-γ production. Furthermore, we found that blocking PD-L1 directly on tumors dampens glycolysis by inhibiting mTOR activity and decreasing expression of glycolysis enzymes, reflecting a role for PD-L1 in tumor glucose utilization. Our results establish that tumor-imposed metabolic restrictions can mediate T cell hyporesponsiveness during cancer."

Host immunity provides wide spectrum protection that serves to eradicate cancerous cells in addition to infectious pathogens. Multiple types of immune cells are involved in tumor immunosurveillance and of particular importance are the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (i.e., T cells) (Braumüller et al., 2013Braumüller H. Wieder T. Brenner E. Aßmann S. Hahn M. Alkhaled M. Schilbach K. Essmann F. Kneilling M. Griessinger C. et al.T-helper-1-cell cytokines drive cancer into senescence.Nature. 2013; 494: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, Shiao et al., 2011Shiao S.L. Ganesan A.P. Rugo H.S. Coussens L.M. Immune microenvironments in solid tumors: new targets for therapy.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 2559-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In most established tumors, however, the tumoricidal effector functions of TILs such as IFNγ production and cytotoxicity are restricted by multiple environmental factors. This includes the accumulation of immunoregulatory cells such as regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs), myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (Mellman et al., 2011Mellman I. Coukos G. Dranoff G. Cancer immunotherapy comes of age.Nature. 2011; 480: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2534) Google Scholar, Shiao et al., 2011Shiao S.L. Ganesan A.P. Rugo H.S. Coussens L.M. Immune microenvironments in solid tumors: new targets for therapy.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 2559-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Additionally, alterations in the availability of nutrients (e.g., lactate and tryptophan-related metabolites such as kynurenine) in the tumor microenvironment can limit TIL activity (Yang et al., 2013Yang M. Soga T. Pollard P.J. Oncometabolites: linking altered metabolism with cancer.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 3652-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Another prominent feature of TILs is the increased expression of inhibitory checkpoint receptors (e.g., programmed cell death protein 1 [PD-1], lymphocyte-activation gene 3 [Lag3], and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA-4]) that desensitizes T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and contributes to their functional impairment (Baitsch et al., 2012Baitsch L. Fuertes-Marraco S.A. Legat A. Meyer C. Speiser D.E. The three main stumbling blocks for anticancer T cells.Trends Immunol. 2012; 33: 364-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). T cells displaying such properties are commonly referred to as “functionally exhausted” (Wherry, 2011Wherry E.J. T cell exhaustion.Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar). These discoveries have led to the development of cancer immunotherapies that reawaken exhausted TILs by blocking inhibitory checkpoint receptors such as PD-1 or CTLA-4 or targeting other immunoregulatory cells. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) of tumor-specific T cells is another promising form of anti-cancer immunotherapy that increases the repertoire of cytotoxic T cells to eradicate established tumors. ACT has the added benefit of permitting genetic modifications of TILs to express proteins that could aide in tumor destruction (Maude et al., 2014Maude S.L. Frey N. Shaw P.A. Aplenc R. Barrett D.M. Bunin N.J. Chew A. Gonzalez V.E. Zheng Z. Lacey S.F. et al.Chimeric antigen receptor T cells for sustained remissions in leukemia.N. Engl. J. Med. 2014; 371: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (3554) Google Scholar). These breakthroughs demonstrate that tumor immunotherapy holds great promise (Callahan et al., 2010Callahan M.K. Wolchok J.D. Allison J.P. Anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapy: immune monitoring during clinical development of a novel immunotherapy.Semin. Oncol. 2010; 37: 473-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, Wolchok et al., 2013Wolchok J.D. Kluger H. Callahan M.K. Postow M.A. Rizvi N.A. Lesokhin A.M. Segal N.H.

Med. 2013; 369: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (3271) Google Scholar), but also present us with challenges to devise additional treatment options in conjunction with those currently available to further increase patient objective responses. To meet these challenges, we must gain a clearer understanding of what causes T cell exhaustion in tumors, and we hypothesize that the metabolic states of the TILs and tumor cells, as well as other cell types in the tumor microenvironment, are principal components of this process. Deregulated anabolic metabolism and increased rates of aerobic glycolysis (i.e., the Warburg effect), glutaminolysis and fatty acid synthesis are cardinal features of most tumor cells that fuels their growth and proliferation (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation.Cell. 2011; 144: 646-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42748) Google Scholar, Ward and Thompson, 2012Ward P.S. Thompson C.B. Metabolic reprogramming: a cancer hallmark even warburg did not anticipate.Cancer Cell. 2012; 21: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). Interestingly, activated T lymphocytes undergo a metabolic switch similar to cancer cells and upregulate aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis to permit proliferation and differentiation into specialized effector T cells. Given their similarities in metabolic profiles and nutrient requirements, it is possible that the abnormally high metabolic rates and consumption of nutrients by tumor cells competes with neighboring T cells, which leads to T cell metabolic exhaustion that underlies their functional exhaustion. Supporting this notion, reports have shown that the concentration of extracellular glucose are lower in tumors compared to healthy tissues (Gullino et al., 1964Gullino P.M. Clark S.H. Grantham F.H. The Interstitial Fluid of Solid Tumors.Cancer Res. 1964; 24: 780-794PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, limited glucose availability could be an environmental restriction that promotes T cell exhaustion, and if true, it is important to learn how this affects T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and effector functions in tumors. Perhaps, new therapies directed at reprogramming T cell metabolism could be developed to enhance their functional fitness in the tumor microenvironment. TCR stimulation activates numerous key signaling pathways that coordinately induce anabolic metabolism, aerobic glycolysis, and effector T cell proliferation and differentiation (Smith-Garvin et al., 2009Smith-Garvin J.E. Koretzky G.A. Jordan M.S. T cell activation.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 591-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). Increased aerobic glycolysis is essential for the production of biosynthetic precursors that fuel effector T cell proliferation and production of effector molecules like IFNγ, IL-2, and IL-17 and Granzyme B in T cells (Cham et al., 2008Cham C.M. Driessens G. O’Keefe J.P. Gajewski T.F. Glucose deprivation inhibits multiple key gene expression events and effector functions in CD8+ T cells.Eur. J.

Immunol. 2011; 186: 3299-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). Activation of PI3K, Akt, and mTOR triggers the switch to anabolic metabolism by inducing transcription factors such as Myc and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) (MacIver et al., 2013MacIver N.J.

T cells rendered functionally anergic that are unable to activate Ca2+ and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling show diminished rates of aerobic glycolysis and anabolic metabolism following stimulation (Srinivasan and Frauwirth, 2007Srinivasan M. Frauwirth K.A. Reciprocal NFAT1 and NFAT2 nuclear localization in CD8+ anergic T cells is regulated by suboptimal calcium signaling.J.

Immunol. 2009; 183: 6095-6101Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Similarly, CD8 T cells with increased PD-1 expression fail to fully activate mTOR or aerobic glycolysis following TCR stimulation and conversely, those with hyper-HIF1α activity and aerobic glycolysis are refractory to functional exhaustion (Doedens et al., 2013Doedens A.L.

The glycolytic enzymes may also serve direct roles in regulating effector functions in T cells because recent work showed that when glycolytic rates are low, the glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) binds to and suppresses Ifng mRNA translation in T cells (Chang et al., 2013Chang C.H. Curtis J.D. Maggi Jr., L.B. Faubert B. Villarino A.V. O’Sullivan D. Huang S.C. van der Windt G.J. Blagih J.

Immunol. 2013; 14: 1064-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate strong interconnections between T cell metabolism and effector functions but little remains known about how metabolic pathways or their metabolites fine-tune T cell activity. In this study, we found that intratumoral CD4 T cells displayed signs of glucose deprivation and diminished anti-tumor effector functions, suggesting that a glucose-poor tumor microenvironment might contribute to TIL exhaustion. Furthermore, increased expression of hexokinase 2 (HK2) in tumor cells allowed for more efficient evasion of CD4 T cell-mediated immune surveillance indicating that a metabolic competition could exist between TILs and tumor cells. Linking glucose-deprivation to T cell function, we also discovered that insufficiency of the glycolytic metabolite phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) led to defects in Ca2+-NFAT signaling and T cell activation by increasing SERCA-mediated Ca2+ re-uptake. Most importantly, we provided proof-of-concept evidence that metabolic reprogramming of T cells to increase PEP production could be a promising strategy to elevate T cell mediated anti-tumor immune responses and improve the effects of adoptive T cell transfer immunotherapy. To investigate whether limited glucose availability within the tumor microenvironment suppressed aerobic glycolysis and hence, effector functions in TILs, we first compared the concentration of glucose in the interstitial fluid of the spleen, blood, and tumors from melanoma-bearing Tyr-creERT2/BrafV600E/Ptenlox (Braf/Pten) mice (Dankort et al., 2009Dankort D. Curley D.P. Cartlidge R.A. Nelson B. Karnezis A.N. Damsky Jr., W.E. You M.J. DePinho R.A. McMahon M. Bosenberg M. Braf(V600E) cooperates with Pten loss to induce metastatic melanoma.Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A) and B16 melanoma-bearing mice (data not shown). As reported in other solid tumors (Gullino et al., 1964Gullino P.M. Clark S.H. Grantham F.H. The Interstitial Fluid of Solid Tumors.Cancer Res. 1964; 24: 780-794PubMed Google Scholar), the glucose level of the tumor interstitial fluid (∼0.6 mM) was approximately ten times lower than that of the spleen and blood (∼9 mM). Additionally, intratumoral CD44hi CD25lo CD4+ T cells (i.e., activated non-Treg CD4+ T cells) failed to take-up glucose as efficiently as their counterparts in the spleen based on intracellular staining with the fluorescent glucose analog 2-NBDG (Figure 1B). We further assessed 2NDBG-uptake in tumor infiltrating non-Treg CD4+ T cells, Tregs, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and MDSCs. This showed that non-Treg CD4+ T cells take-up marginally less 2NDBG than TAMs, but not MDCSs. Unexpectedly, the intramoral and splenic Tregs demonstrated higher 2NDBG uptake compared to the other cell populations (Figure S1A). Furthermore, co-culturing TH1 CD4+ T cells with Braf/Pten melanoma cells demonstrated that the presence of tumor cells could reduce glucose uptake by TH1 cells (Figure 1C), suggesting that tumor cells may directly restrict glucose availability for TILs. As there is no facile way to directly and specifically measure rates of glycolysis in TILs in vivo or in situ, we attempted to determine if intratumoral CD4+ T cells express genes induced by glucose deprivation. We identified a “glucose-deprivation transcriptional signature” in CD4+ T cells by comparing the differentially expressed genes of activated TH1 cells cultured in high (10 mM) or low (0.1 mM) glucose concentrations using RNA-sequencing and microarrays (Figure S1B), and observed that intratumoral CD4+ T cells expressed higher levels of the glucose-deprived signature genes than CD4+ T cells in the draining lymph nodes (dLNs) (Figure 1D). This result suggested that some portion of the CD4+ TILs experienced glucose-deprivation within the tumor microenvironment in vivo.Figure S1Glucose-Deprivation Gene Signature in TH1 Cells, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Glucose uptake by intratumoral immune cells was determined using FITC labeled 2-NBDG and measured by flow cytometry.

Next, we stimulated functional TH1 CD4+ T cells (isolated from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-infected animals) in different concentrations of glucose (ranging from 0.1–10 mM) to directly interrogate the effects of glucose deprivation on production of CD40 ligand (CD40L) and IFNγ—two factors critical for maintaining an immunostimulatory microenvironment in the Braf/Pten melanomas (Ho et al., 2014Ho P.C. Meeth K.M. Tsui Y.C. Srivastava B. Bosenberg M.W. Kaech S.M. Immune-based antitumor effects of BRAF inhibitors rely on signaling by CD40L and IFNγ.Cancer Res. 2014; 74: 3205-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This showed that these effector functions were suppressed by limited amounts of glucose (Figure 1E). Conversely, glucose deprivation augmented TGFβ production in activated CD4+ T cells (Figure 1F), suggesting that glucose deprivation can cause CD4+ T cells to switch from immuno-supportive to immuno-suppressive states. Importantly, the CD4+ T cells isolated directly ex vivo from melanomas displayed similar functional attributes to the in vitro glucose-deprived TH1 cells. For example, the percentage of CD44hi CD25lo (non-Treg) CD4+ T cells that produced IFNγ or CD40L in the tumors was ∼50% lower than that in the spleen or dLN (Figure 1G). Additionally, the expression of the TGFβ latency associated peptide (LAP), a surrogate marker for cells competent to produce TGFβ, was examined on the CD4+ T cells (Figures 1H–IJ), and this showed that a greater proportion of non-Treg CD4+ T cells expressed elevated LAP compared to the FoxP3+ Tregs in both the tumors and dLNs (Figure 1J). Collectively, these data demonstrate that CD4+ TILs display genetic and functional features associated with glucose-deprivation and suggest that competition between tumor cells and TILs for glucose in the tumor microenvironment could contribute to an immunosuppressive environment. Increased rates of aerobic glycolysis and expression of glycolytic enzymes (e.g., hexokinase 2 [Hk2]) are common hallmarks of cancer cells (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation.Cell. 2011; 144: 646-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42748) Google Scholar), and this may lead to glucose-deprivation and T cell dysfunction in tumors as suggested by the data above. To investigate this hypothesis further, we analyzed the expression of effector T cell genes (e.g., Ifng and Cd40lg) and markers of glycolysis (e.g., Hk2) mRNA within the tumors of 384 melanoma patients (data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA]) (Cerami et al., 2012Cerami E. Gao J. Dogrusoz U. Gross B.E. Sumer S.O. Aksoy B.A. Jacobsen A. Byrne C.J. Heuer M.L. Larsson E. et al.The cBio cancer genomics portal: an open platform for exploring multidimensional cancer genomics data.Cancer Discov. 2012; 2: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (9402) Google Scholar, Gao et al., 2013Gao J. Aksoy B.A. Dogrusoz U. Dresdner G. Gross B. Sumer S.O. Sun Y. Jacobsen A. Sinha R. Larsson E. et al.Integrative analysis of complex cancer genomics and clinical profiles using the cBioPortal.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6 (pl1)Crossref Scopus (8706) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this showed that the amount of Cd40lg and Ifng mRNA inversely correlated with Hk2 mRNA (Figure S2A). To more directly test if the glycolytic rates of tumor cells affect tumor immunosurveillance by CD4+ T cells, we established stable clones of the Braf/Pten melanoma cell line (YUMM1.7) that expressed either a control vector or one overexpressing HK2 (HK2-OE). As expected, HK2-OE tumor cells had higher rates of aerobic glycolysis than the control cells based on extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) using the Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Figure S2B) and HK2-OE tumor cells more efficiently suppressed glucose uptake of TH1 CD4+ T cells in the co-culture assay (Figure S2C). Then we engrafted control and HK2-OE melanoma cell lines into the left and right flanks, respectively, of wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Two weeks later, the production of CD40L and IFNγ by CD4+ TILs restimulated directly ex vivo was assessed and compared to CD4+ T cells isolated from the control melanomas, those isolated from HK2-OE tumors had lower production of CD40L and IFNγ (Figures 2A and 2B and S2D). This result demonstrated that T cell effector functions could be affected by the rates of tumor cell aerobic glycolysis. Next, we compared the growth rates of control and HK2-OE melanoma cell lines engrafted into the left and right flanks, respectively, of Rag1-KO mice that were either reconstituted with CD4+ T cells or not. In accord with higher rates of aerobic glycolysis, the HK2-OE melanomas grew faster compared to the control tumors in both groups of mice (Figure 2C). However, the presence of CD4+ T cells potently suppressed the growth of control melanoma cells, but had little effect on the HK2-OE melanoma cells (Figures 2C–2E). Taken together, these results support the intriguing model that tumor cells with increased rates of aerobic glycolysis are better able to evade anti-tumor CD4+ T cell responses.Figure 2HK2 Overexpression in Melanoma Cells Suppresses CD4+ T Cell-Mediated Anti-tumor ResponsesShow full caption(A and B) Control (Ctrl) or HK2-OE Braf/Pten tumors were engrafted into the right and left flanks of C57BL/6 mice.

To better understand how glucose deprivation alters TH1 cell functions, we examined how glycolysis affects TCR signaling after TCR stimulation using several approaches. First, we observed that the induction of the immediate early gene Nur77 (as measured using a Nur77-eGFP reporter that reads out TCR signaling in a Ca2+-dependent manner; Moran et al., 2011Moran A.E. Holzapfel K.L. Xing Y. Cunningham N.R. Maltzman J.S. Punt J. Hogquist K.A. T cell receptor signal strength in Treg and iNKT cell development demonstrated by a novel fluorescent reporter mouse.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 1279-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) was suppressed in glucose-poor conditions or in the presence of 2-DG (Figure 3A). In contrast, the amount of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) or AKT (pAKTS473 and pAKTT308) was minimally affected following activation of TH1 CD4 T cells in glucose-deprived conditions (Figure S3). The defect in Nur77 induction prompted us to more closely monitor cytoplasmic calcium flux using the ratiometric Ca2+-sensitive dyes (Fluo-4 and Fura-Red) and flow cytometry, and this revealed that glucose deprivation profoundly repressed TCR-induced Ca2+ flux in activated TH1 cells (Figure 3B). Moreover, reducing aerobic glycolysis in activated TH1 cells by glucose deprivation or deletion of the glucose transporter 1 (Macintyre et al., 2014Macintyre A.N. Gerriets V.A. Nichols A.G. Michalek R.D. Rudolph M.C. Deoliveira D. Anderson S.M. Abel E.D. Chen B.J. Hale L.P. Rathmell J.C.

This latter result indicated that the defect in Ca2+ flux could be IP3-independent because ionomycin triggers Ca2+ efflux from the ER in an IP3-independent manner. In agreement, glucose deprivation did not affect TCR-induced phosphorylation of PLCγ-1 in TH1 cells (Figure 3E). Altogether, these results suggested that glucose-deprivation dampened the magnitude of TCR-induced Ca2+ flux, and consequently CD4+ T cell effector functions.Figure S3ERK1/2 and Akt Activation in Glucose-Deprived TH1 CD4 T Cells, Related to Figure 3Show full captionTH1 CD4+ T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 in the indicated conditions and amounts of phospho-ERK1/2, phosphor-AktS473, and phospho-AktT308 were measured by intracellular staining and flow cytometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Down"

Nucleotide modifications can expand the information content of nucleic acids. Methylation of cytosines on promoter DNA, for example, can alter the transcriptional output of genes. RNA can also be modified by a myriad of marks and mRNA modifications, including, among others, N6-methyladenosine, 5-methylcytosine, 2′ O-methylation of ribose, and pseudouridylation (Jaffrey, 2014Jaffrey S.R. An expanding universe of mRNA modifications.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21: 945-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The functional roles of the majority of these chemical modifications are unknown. The most common internal modification of eukaryotic messenger RNA is methylation of the N6 nitrogen on adenosine referred to as N6-methyladenosine (m6A). Each transcript contains one to three m6A marks on average, which are located in specific positions in introns, exons, and UTRs. Methylation of specific positions is non-stoichiometric—with only a fraction of transcripts containing this mark at specific sites. While this important modification was discovered over four decades ago, the transcriptome-wide mapping of this mark using next-generation sequencing analysis has recently revived interest in the biological role(s) of m6A (Dominissini et al., 2012Dominissini D.

Methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3) was the first methyltransferase implicated in placing m6A on RNA (Dominissini et al., 2012Dominissini D. Moshitch-Moshkovitz S. Schwartz S. Salmon-Divon M. Ungar L.

METTL14, which exists in complex with METTL3, has also been shown to exhibit m6A methyltransferase activity (Liu et al., 2014Liu J. Yue Y. Han D. Wang X. Fu Y. Zhang L. Jia G. Yu M. Lu Z.

Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) was recently identified as an enzyme that can remove this mark (Jia et al., 2011Jia G. Fu Y. Zhao X. Dai Q. Zheng G. Yang Y. Yi C. Lindahl T. Pan T.

Classical experiments suggested a role for m6A in the nuclear processing of viral and non-viral transcripts (Carroll et al., 1990Carroll S.M. Narayan P. Rottman F.M.

More recent molecular studies have demonstrated m6A to exhibit both a nuclear role in splicing (Dominissini et al., 2012Dominissini D. Moshitch-Moshkovitz S. Schwartz S. Salmon-Divon M. Ungar L. Osenberg S. Cesarkas K. Jacob-Hirsch J. Amariglio N. Kupiec M. et al.Topology of the human and mouse m6A RNA methylomes revealed by m6A-seq.Nature. 2012; 485: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar) and a cytoplasmic role in the regulation of RNA stability (Batista et al., 2014Batista P.J. Molinie B. Wang J. Qu K. Zhang J. Li L. Bouley D.M. Lujan E. Haddad B. Daneshvar K. et al.m(6)A RNA modification controls cell fate transition in mammalian embryonic stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 707-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2014aWang X.

Jia G. et al.N6-methyladenosine-dependent regulation of messenger RNA stability.Nature. 2014; 505: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). We have recently found that m6A plays an additional role in the nucleus in controlling microRNA biogenesis. M6A was found to be enriched in primary microRNA transcripts. Reducing m6A levels by depleting the m6A writer METTL3 reduced the levels of the majority of expressed microRNAs (Alarcón et al., 2015Alarcón C.R. Lee H. Goodarzi H. Halberg N. Tavazoie S.F. N6-methyladenosine marks primary microRNAs for processing.Nature. 2015; 519: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). This effect occurred in the nucleus since METTL3/m6A depletion reduced the association of the DGCR8-containing microRNA processing complex with primary microRNAs and caused unprocessed primary microRNA precursors to accumulate in the nucleus. These findings are consistent with a model wherein the m6A RNA mark is recognized and bound by nuclear reader protein(s), which recruit the Microprocessor complex to pri-miRNA containing transcripts—resulting in their processing. Recently the YTH domain family 2 (YTHDF2) protein was identified as a “reader” of m6A and found to regulate the stability of m6A-bearing transcripts in the cytoplasm (Wang et al., 2014aWang X. Lu Z. Gomez A. Hon G.C. Yue Y. Han D. Fu Y. Parisien M. Dai Q. Jia G. et al.N6-methyladenosine-dependent regulation of messenger RNA stability.Nature. 2014; 505: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). The proposed role of m6A in the control of alternative splicing and our recent findings regarding its impact on primary microRNA processing (Alarcón et al., 2015Alarcón C.R. Lee H. Goodarzi H. Halberg N. Tavazoie S.F. N6-methyladenosine marks primary microRNAs for processing.Nature. 2015; 519: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar) suggest the existence of nuclear reader(s) of m6A that bind this mark and mediate nuclear processing events that are mechanistically distinct from RNA stability regulatory events that could occur in the cytoplasm. We herein identify HNRNPA2B1 as a nuclear reader of m6A. HNRNPA2B1 binds to RGm6AC containing sites on nuclear RNAs in vivo and in vitro. HNRNPA2B1 regulates the alternative splicing of exons in a set of transcripts in a similar manner as METTL3, the m6A “writer.” The global impact of HNRNPA2B1 depletion on alternative splicing is highly correlated with the global effect of METTL3 depletion on alternative splicing. HNRNPA2B1 depletion also impairs the nuclear processing of a subset of microRNAs whose maturation is dependent on METTL3 activity. Moreover, HNRNPA2B1 interacts with the DGCR8 protein, a component of the pri-miRNA Microprocessor complex, and facilitates the processing of pri-miRNAs. Our findings implicate HNRNPA2B1 as a nuclear reader and effector of the m6A mark. The presence of the m6A mark has been historically associated with the processing of nuclear transcripts. Our previous identification of m6A as a regulatory mark that promotes the processing of pri-miRNA transcripts—a process that occurs in the nucleus—also suggested the existence of one or more nuclear readers of this mark that mediate its downstream effector functions. Several approaches that combine UV cross-linking of RNA-binding proteins with immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing of bound RNAs have proven powerful at mapping the sites of interaction between RNA-binding proteins and their target RNAs (Hafner et al., 2010Hafner M. Landthaler M. Burger L. Khorshid M. Hausser J. Berninger P. Rothballer A. Ascano M. Jungkamp A.C. Munschauer M. et al.PAR-CliP--a method to identify transcriptome-wide the binding sites of RNA binding proteins.J. Vis. Exp. 2010; : 2034PubMed Google Scholar, König et al., 2010König J. Zarnack K.

CLIP: a method for identifying protein-RNA interaction sites in living cells.Methods. 2005; 37: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Our laboratories have in the past few years conducted a number of such high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by cross-linking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP; Zhang and Darnell, 2011Zhang C. Darnell R.B. Mapping in vivo protein-RNA interactions at single-nucleotide resolution from HITS-CLIP data.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) studies to map the genome-wide binding of a variety of RNA-binding proteins. Our analysis of the direct binding sites of one such RNA-binding protein, HNRNPA2B1 (Goodarzi et al., 2012Goodarzi H. Najafabadi H.S. Oikonomou P. Greco T.M. Fish L. Salavati R. Cristea I.M. Tavazoie S. Systematic discovery of structural elements governing stability of mammalian messenger RNAs.Nature. 2012; 485: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), suggested that it might act as a reader of the m6A mark. HNRNPA2B1 is a member of the hnRNP family of RNA-binding proteins that are known to associate with pre-mRNAs in the nucleus. The m6A mark is known to occur within the RGAC motif, with R representing a purine (Schibler et al., 1977Schibler U. Kelley D.E. Perry R.P. Comparison of methylated sequences in messenger RNA and heterogeneous nuclear RNA from mouse L cells.J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 115: 695-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that HNRNPA2B1 also recognizes this motif, we assessed the abundance of this sequence among the HNRNPA2B1 HITS-CLIP peaks relative to randomly generated sequence counterparts with similar dinucleotide frequencies (Giannopoulou and Elemento, 2011Giannopoulou E.G. Elemento O. An integrated ChIP-seq analysis platform with customizable workflows.BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12: 277Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Indeed, using the FIRE analysis pipeline (Elemento et al., 2007Elemento O. Slonim N. Tavazoie S. A universal framework for regulatory element discovery across all genomes and data types.Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 337-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), we observed a highly significant enrichment of the RGAC element in HNRNPA2B1 binding sites (Figure 1A). We next overlapped the m6A peaks from an RNA-seq analysis of m6A-immunoprecipitated nuclear RNA (m6A-seq; Alarcón et al., 2015Alarcón C.R. Lee H. Goodarzi H. Halberg N. Tavazoie S.F. N6-methyladenosine marks primary microRNAs for processing.Nature. 2015; 519: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar) with HNRNPA2B1 binding peaks obtained from HITS-CLIP of endogenous nuclear HNRNPA2B1 performed for this study in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We noted a significant number of cases wherein the HNRNPA2B1 peaks overlapped with m6A peaks (Figures 1B and S1A; p value < 1e−3), consistent with an enrichment of m6A at HNRNPA2B1 binding sites. Of the 1,912 human genes bound by HNRNPA2B1 and containing m6A peaks, 426 contained RGAC instances overlapping both an HNRNPA2B1 HITS-CLIP peak and an m6A-seq peak (FDR < 10%). Conducting this analysis on HITS-CLIP data we had previously generated for MBNL1 and TARBP2 revealed zero such cases of overlap for these RNA-binding proteins. The enrichment of the RGAC motif in HNRNPA2B1 binding sites may be due to general proximity of the RGAC motif to the HNRNPA2B1 binding sites rather than due to direct interactions with the RGAC motif. The RNA-binding protein hnRNPC, for example, has been shown to bind near—rather than directly to—the RGAC motif (Liu et al., 2015Liu N. Dai Q. Zheng G. He C. Parisien M. Pan T. N(6)-methyladenosine-dependent RNA structural switches regulate RNA-protein interactions.Nature. 2015; 518: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). Thus, to study the specificity of overlap between the HNRNPA2B1 footprint and the m6A consensus motif at nucleotide resolution, we took advantage of cross-linking-induced deletions that are a hallmark of HITS-CLIP experiments and that provide a nucleotide-level map of physical points of interaction (Zhang and Darnell, 2011Zhang C. Darnell R.B. Mapping in vivo protein-RNA interactions at single-nucleotide resolution from HITS-CLIP data.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). For this, we limited our search to the cross-linking-induced deletions that mark the sites of direct interactions between HNRNPA2B1 and its target RNAs (CIMS; Zhang and Darnell, 2011Zhang C. Darnell R.B. Mapping in vivo protein-RNA interactions at single-nucleotide resolution from HITS-CLIP data.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). We also defined a set of control sequences consisting of deletion-containing reads that represent the background occurrence of deletion events during HITS-CLIP sample preparation (i.e., these reads were not part of a peak or cluster; Figure S1). We then used FIRE to re-evaluate the abundance of the RGAC motif in HNRNPA2B1 footprints (i.e., cross-linking-induced deletion sites along with 5 nt flanking sequences on either side). We observed a highly significant enrichment of RGAC motifs at these cross-linking-induced deletions (p value < 1e−26, Z score = 109; Figure 1C). A similar analysis applied to two other RNA-binding proteins for which comparable HITS-CLIP data were available revealed HNRNPA2B1 to be unique among this group in exhibiting a significant enrichment for proximal binding to the RGAC motif (Figures 1C and S1C). Importantly, 6.8% of the nuclear HNRNPA2B1 cross-linking-induced deletions overlapped with an m6A peak, whereas only 0.34% of the background deletions overlapped with m6A sites (20-fold enrichment, Figure S1D). These findings strongly support a role for HNRNPA2B1 in directly binding to a subset of m6A consensus sequences within the transcriptome. The m6A mark has been associated with Carroll et al., 1990Carroll S.M. Narayan P. Rottman F.M. N6-methyladenosine residues in an intron-specific region of prolactin pre-mRNA.Mol. Cell.

Kupiec M. et al.Topology of the human and mouse m6A RNA methylomes revealed by m6A-seq.Nature. 2012; 485: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar). Depletion of METTL3 has also been shown to impact alternative splicing (Dominissini et al., 2012Dominissini D. Moshitch-Moshkovitz S. Schwartz S. Salmon-Divon M. Ungar L. Osenberg S. Cesarkas K. Jacob-Hirsch J. Amariglio N. Kupiec M. et al.Topology of the human and mouse m6A RNA methylomes revealed by m6A-seq.Nature. 2012; 485: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that HNRNPA2B1, by acting downstream of m6A placement by METTL3, may impact alternative splicing in a similar manner as METTL3. If this were the case, depleting HNRNPA2B1 should result in similar alterations in alternative splicing patterns as depletion of METTL3. To test this, we conducted high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on nuclear RNA from cells depleted of METTL3 and those depleted of HNRNPA2B1. We then employed MISO, a probabilistic framework (Katz et al., 2010Katz Y. Wang E.T. Airoldi E.M. Burge C.B. Analysis and design of RNA sequencing experiments for identifying isoform regulation.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar), to quantify the relative expression of alternatively spliced exons in METTL3 and HNRNPA2B1 knockdown cells as well as controls. The differences in MISO-calculated Ψ (psi, percent-spliced in) values between each of the knockdown samples and the control samples were used as a measure of modulations in alternative splicing events upon depletion of each of these factors. Consistent with a role for HNRNPA2B1 in mediating alternative splicing effects downstream of METTL3/m6A, we observed that the global impact on alternative splicing was highly correlated in cells depleted for each of these genes. This effect was observed in skipped exons (ρ = 0.335; p < 1e−200; Figure 2A), retained introns (ρ = 0.373; p < 1e−140; Figure 2B), alternative first exons (ρ = 0.378; p < 1e−300; Figure 2C), and alternative last exons (ρ = 0.299; p < 1e−170; Figure 2D). The effects on alternative splicing in the context of HNRNPA2B1 and METTL3 depletion were seen in two independent cell lines (Figures 2E, 2F, and S2). These findings reveal that HNRNPA2B1 depletion has similar genome-wide consequences on alternative splicing as METTL3 depletion. These observations, along with our findings that HNRNPA2B1 binds m6A sites, support a model whereby HNRNPA2B1 mediates, in part, the alternative splicing effects of METTL3 and the m6A mark.Figure S2Effects of HNRNPA2B1 Depletion on Alternative Splicing in HeLa and MDA-MB-231 Cells, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Correlation between differential percent spliced in (ψ) in annotated alternative splicing events following HNRNPA2B1 and METLL3 depletion in HeLa cells.

We next asked whether HNRNPA2B1 governs the processing of pri-miRNAs that are dependent on METTL3/m6A for their processing. For this, we performed global microRNA profiling in HEK293 cells depleted of HNRNPA2B1. HNRNPA2B1 knockdown caused a reduction in the levels of a large number of microRNAs (Figures 3A and S3). This reduction could also be visualized as a left shift in the population-level expression of miRNAs (Figure 3B; p < 1e−3). The reduction in mature microRNA expression mirrored what was previously observed upon METTL3 depletion (Alarcón et al., 2015Alarcón C.R. Lee H. Goodarzi H. Halberg N. Tavazoie S.F. N6-methyladenosine marks primary microRNAs for processing.Nature. 2015; 519: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar).Figure S3Depletion of HNRNPA2B1 and METTL3, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) qRT-PCR quantification of HNRNPA2B1 expression levels in cells expressing a control hairpin or in cells expressing two independent hairpins targeting HNRNPA2B1. p-value < 1E-3.(B) Quantification of METTL3 expression levels in cells that express a control hairpin or in cells expressing independent HNRNPA2B1 targeting hairpins. ∗∗∗∗, p-value < 1E-4; ∗∗∗, p-value < 1E-3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) qRT-PCR quantification of HNRNPA2B1 expression levels in cells expressing a control hairpin or in cells expressing two independent hairpins targeting HNRNPA2B1. p-value < 1E-3.

We next investigated the overlap between the set of miRNAs impacted by HNRNPA2B1 depletion and those impacted by METTL3 depletion. Importantly, 95% (58 out of 61) of the miRNAs that decreased in their expression by more than 50% upon HNRNPA2B1 depletion were also affected, with similar intensity, upon depletion of METTL3 (p < 1e−24, Figure 3C and Table S1). The fraction of miRNAs affected by HNRNPA2B1 depletion was roughly half of the total miRNAs regulated by METTL3—indicating that HNRNPA2B1 regulates a major subset, but not all, of the m6A-dependent miRNAs. In order to validate these findings using an independent approach, we performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) for specific miRNAs in the setting of HNRNPA2B1 knockdown using additional cell lines. Consistent with the findings described above, HNRNPA2B1 depletion caused a significant reduction in the expression levels of the mature forms of a number of m6A-regulated miRNAs in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4A), as well as HEK293 cells (Figure S4). Moreover, the expression levels of these miRNAs were also dependent on METTL3, as their levels were similarly significantly reduced upon METTL3 depletion in both cell lines (Figures 4B and S4).Figure S4Effects of HNRNPA2B1 and METTL3 Depletion on Mature miRNA Levels, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) qRT-PCR quantification of exemplary miRNAs modulated by HNRNPA2B1 depletion in HEK293 cells.

We next asked whether HNRNPA2B1 binds to pri-miRNA sites and whether it regulates the processing of METTL3/m6A-dependent microRNAs. To answer these questions, we identified m6A peaks in pri-miRNA transcripts from m6A-seq data and searched for co-occurrence with HNRNPA2B1 binding sites. Consistent with a direct role for HNRNPA2B1 in regulating the processing of these pri-miRNA transcripts, we noted overlaps between m6A peaks and HNRNPA2B1 binding sites detected by HITS-CLIP (Figure 4C). Importantly, of the 61 miRNAs affected by HNRNPA2B1 depletion, 53 contained m6A-seq tags, and 52 of those exhibited overlapping HNRNPA2B1 HITS-CLIP tags (p = 3e−9, Figure 4D). These findings are consistent with recognition of the m6A mark by HNRNPA2B1 at miRNA loci. If HNRNPA2B1 mediates its effects in the nucleus prior to the processing of pri-miRNAs to pre-miRNAs, then its depletion should result in the accumulation of pri-miRNA transcripts within the nucleus. Consistent with this, depletion of HNRNPA2B1 resulted in the accumulation of specific pri-miRNAs in the nucleus, phenocopying the effect of METTL3 depletion (Figure 5A). HNRNPA2B1 thus positively regulates the nuclear processing of a set of pri-miRNAs. The processing of these pri-miRNAs is dependent on METTL3, the m6A writer, and HNRNPA2B1, a putative reader of this mark. These findings are consistent with a model wherein METTL3 and HNRNPA2B1 proteins comprise a pathway that controls the processing of a set of miRNA precursors. A reader of m6A should serve as a bridge between this mark and effector proteins or adaptor proteins that would ultimately interact with effectors. The effector involved in pri-miRNA processing is the Microprocessor complex, which is composed of the proteins DGCR8 and DROSHA.

Recently, several groups presented the structures of YTH domains, including the YTH domain of Zygosaccharomyces rouxii MRB1 with a 7-mer m6ARNA (23Luo S. Tong L.

Crystal structure of the YTH domain of YTHDF2 reveals mechanism for recognition of N6-methyladenosine.Cell Res. 2014; 24: 1493-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and with the m6A nucleotide (26Li F. Zhao D. Wu J. Shi Y.

In the YTH domain complex structures, the m6A base is positioned in a hydrophobic pocket consisting of two or three aromatic residues. The m6A binding mode is reminiscent of the methyllysine and methylarginine binding mode (27Patel D.J. Wang Z. Readout of epigenetic modifications.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 81-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our structural and binding studies of YTHDC1 also established that YTHDC1 slightly prefers a G nucleotide and disfavors an A nucleotide at the position preceding the m6A nucleotide in RNA (24Xu C. Wang X. Liu K. Roundtree I.A. Tempel W. Li Y. Lu Z. He C. Min J. Structural basis for selective binding of mA RNA by the YTHDC1 YTH domain.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014; 10: 927-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In the human genome, there are at least five YTH domain-containing proteins, and we wonder whether these YTH domains have distinct sequence selectivity, similar to the Royal family or PHD domain histone readers (27Patel D.J. Wang Z. Readout of epigenetic modifications.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 81-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In this study, we systematically characterized the m6A binding ability of four human YTH domains and the YTH domain of yeast Pho92 and determined the crystal structures of the YTH domain of human YTHDF1 and its complex with a 5-mer m6A RNA, and the YTH domain of yeast Pho92 in complex with a 5-mer m6A RNA. Our results indicate that the YTH domains recognized the m6A nucleotide in a conserved mode. Whereas YTHDC1 preferentially bound to the GG(m6A)C sequence (24Xu C. Wang X. Liu K. Roundtree I.A. Tempel W. Li Y. Lu Z. He C. Min J. Structural basis for selective binding of mA RNA by the YTHDC1 YTH domain.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014; 10: 927-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), the other YTH domains bound to m6A RNA regardless of sequence context. Structural comparison of the YTHDC1 and YTHDF1 complexes revealed that YTHDC1 and YTHDF1 used different binding pockets to accommodate the nucleotide preceding m6A, corresponding to divergent binding grooves for accommodating RNA 5′ to m6A. Our structural and mutagenesis studies also pinpointed the key residues responsible for the differential sequence selectivity. The Pho92 YTH domain (amino acids 141–306), two constructs of the human YTHDF1 YTH domain (amino acids 361–559 and amino acids 365–554), the YTHDF2 YTH domain (amino acids 380–579), and MJECL36 (amino acids 1–147) were subcloned into a pET28a-MHL vector. All recombinant proteins were overexpressed at 18 °C as N-terminal His6-tagged protein in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) codon plus RIL (Stratagene) and purified by HiTrap nickel column. The His tag was removed by the addition of 0.05 mg of TEV protease per milligram of recombinant protein, followed by the dialysis to remove imidazole at 4 °C for 12 h. The samples were then passed through a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column and further purified by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75; GE Healthcare). The mutants of the Pho92 and YTHDF1 YTH domains were cloned using site-directed mutagenesis kits (Invitrogen) and were expressed and purified in the same way as wild type recombinant proteins. All crystals were obtained using sitting drop vapor diffusion at 20 °C. Crystals of the YTHDF1 YTH domain (361–559) were obtained by mixing 1.0 μl of purified protein (15 mg/ml) with 1.0 μl of reservoir solution containing 0.2 m potassium thiocyanate and 25% PEG 3350 and subsequent equilibration against 800 μl of reservoir buffer. The purified YTHDF1 YTH domain (365–554, 12 mg/ml) was mixed with the 5-mer GG(m6A)CU RNA in a ratio of 1:2 and incubated for 30 min at 0 °C before co-crystallization. Crystals of the complex were obtained by mixing 1.0 μl of the complex with 1.0 μl of reservoir solution containing 0.1 m Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 0.2 m sodium chloride, and 25% PEG 3350 and subsequent equilibration against 800 μl of reservoir buffer. The purified Pho92 YTH domain (141–306, 10 mg/ml) was mixed with the 5-mer UG(m6A)CU RNA in a ratio of 1:2 and incubated for 30 min at 0 °C before co-crystallization. A crystal of the complex was obtained by mixing 1.0 μl of the complex with 1.0 μl of well solution containing 0.2 m potassium isocyanate and 20% PEG 3350 and subsequent equilibration against 800 μl of reservoir buffer.

The preliminary model was further refined against higher resolution diffraction data from another, isomorphous crystal. The YTHDF1 oligoribonucleotide complex structure was solved by molecular replacement with coordinates from the YTHDF1 “apo” structure.

All ITC experiments were performed at 298 K using a MicroCal ITC200 (GE Healthcare). All RNAs used for ITC experiments were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific except the unmodified GGACU, which was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. The purity of all purchased RNAs was >90%. All proteins and RNAs were dialyzed or dissolved into the same buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl before the binding experiments. 10–17 injections were recorded by injecting 2 μl of 500–1000 μm of RNAs into a sample well containing 15–60 μm of protein. The concentration of the purified proteins and RNA oligonucleotides were estimated with absorbance spectroscopy (NanoDrop) using the extinction coefficients, A280 and A260, respectively. Each binding isotherm was plotted, analyzed, and fitted in a one-site binding model by Origin Software (MicroCal Inc.) after subtraction of the respective control. The m6A modification has been found from yeast to human, and recent m6A transcriptome analysis reveals that m6A is dominantly present in the RRACU (where R = A/G) consensus motif in mammals (5Dominissini D.

In the human genome, there are at least five YTH domain-containing proteins, and our recent structural and biochemical studies showed that YTHDC1 utilizes an aromatic cage to recognize m6A, and it preferentially recognizes the GG(m6A)C sequence somewhat (24Xu C. Wang X. Liu K. Roundtree I.A. Tempel W. Li Y. Lu Z. He C. Min J. Structural basis for selective binding of mA RNA by the YTHDC1 YTH domain.Nat. Chem.

To understand the binding specificity and sequence selectivity of other YTH domain-containing proteins, we cloned the YTH domains of YTHDF1/2, YTHDC2, and S. cerevisiae Pho92 for quantitative binding and structural studies. Our ITC binding results show that both the human and yeast YTH domains recognized m6A-containing RNA but not unmodified RNA, regardless of the RNA length (Table 1), implying that the YTH domain is an evolutionarily conserved m6A-dependent RNA binding domain. Furthermore, the YTHDF1/2, YTHDC2, and Pho92 YTH domains did not display sequence selectivity at the −1 position (the position preceding the m6A nucleotide), unlike the YTHDC1 YTH domain, which preferred GG(m6A)CU over GA(m6A)CU containing 9-mer RNA (Table 1; see Fig. 4, A–D), consistent with our previous find"
https://openalex.org/W1829176850,"Lipid metabolism is fundamental for brain development and function, but its roles in normal and pathological neural stem cell (NSC) regulation remain largely unexplored. Here, we uncover a fatty acid-mediated mechanism suppressing endogenous NSC activity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found that postmortem AD brains and triple-transgenic Alzheimer's disease (3xTg-AD) mice accumulate neutral lipids within ependymal cells, the main support cell of the forebrain NSC niche. Mass spectrometry and microarray analyses identified these lipids as oleic acid-enriched triglycerides that originate from niche-derived rather than peripheral lipid metabolism defects. In wild-type mice, locally increasing oleic acid was sufficient to recapitulate the AD-associated ependymal triglyceride phenotype and inhibit NSC proliferation. Moreover, inhibiting the rate-limiting enzyme of oleic acid synthesis rescued proliferative defects in both adult neurogenic niches of 3xTg-AD mice. These studies support a pathogenic mechanism whereby AD-induced perturbation of niche fatty acid metabolism suppresses the homeostatic and regenerative functions of NSCs."
https://openalex.org/W1944374588,"Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can survive and proliferate for an extended period of time in culture, but unlike that of tumor-derived cells, this form of cellular immortality does not depend on genomic aberrations. In this study, we sought to elucidate the molecular basis of this long-term growth property of hESCs. We found that the survival of hESCs depends on the small GTPase Rho and its activator AKAP-Lbc. We show that AKAP-Lbc/Rho signaling sustains the nuclear function of the transcriptional cofactors YAP and TAZ by modulating actin microfilament organization. By inducing reprogramming and differentiation, we found that dependency on this Rho signaling pathway is associated with the pluripotent state. Thus, our findings show that the capacity of hESCs to undergo long-term expansion in vitro is intrinsically coupled to their cellular identity through interconnected molecular circuits that link cell survival to pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2231149464,"Contraction is crucial in maintaining the differentiated phenotype of myofibroblasts. Contraction is an energy-dependent mechanism that relies on the production of ATP by mitochondria and/or glycolysis. Although the role of mitochondrial biogenesis in the adaptive responses of skeletal muscle to exercise is well appreciated, mechanisms governing energetic adaptation of myofibroblasts are not well understood. Our study demonstrates induction of mitochondrial biogenesis and aerobic glycolysis in response to the differentiation-inducing factor transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1). This metabolic reprogramming is linked to the activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Inhibition of p38 MAPK decreased accumulation of active peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α in the nucleus and altered the translocation of mitochondrial transcription factor A to the mitochondria. Genetic or pharmacologic approaches that block mitochondrial biogenesis or glycolysis resulted in decreased contraction and reduced expression of TGF-β1-induced α-smooth muscle actin and collagen α-2(I) but not of fibronectin or collagen α-1(I). These data indicate a critical role for TGF-β1-induced metabolic reprogramming in regulating myofibroblast-specific contractile signaling and support the concept of integrating bioenergetics with cellular differentiation.

This positive feedback loop is important for tissue repair because it sustains myofibroblast differentiation after the acute phase of cytokine-mediated myofibroblast activation. Protein synthesis and contraction are highly energy-dependent processes that likely engage both oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis.

Our study supports the essential role for the integration of cellular bioenergetics with gene expression to sustain the differentiated phenotype of myofibroblasts. Porcine platelet-derived TGF-β1 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), protease inhibitor mixture set III was from EMD Chemicals (San Diego, CA), p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 was from Tocris Bioscience (Minneapolis, MN), and MitoTracker® was from Life Technologies.

All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Human fetal lung fibroblasts (IMR-90 cells) at low population doubling (PDL 7) were purchased from Coriell Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ). All cells were cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1.25 μg/ml amphotericin B at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air. Cells treated with TGF-β1 were cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h prior to and during treatment. We prepared cell lysates in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% IGEPAL® CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0; Sigma-Aldrich), and cytosolic and nuclear lysates were prepared using the Pierce NE-PER kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Mitochondria were isolated using the Mitochondria Isolation kit for mammalian cells (Thermo Scientific). The total protein concentration of lysates was quantitated using a Micro BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce) or the DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad). Lysates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and Western immunoblotting was performed as described previously (3Thannickal V.J. Lee D.Y. White E.S. Cui Z. Larios J.M. Chacon R.

Cells were washed in XF assay buffer (DMEM with 1 mm pyruvate, 5.5 mm d-glucose, 4 mm l-glutamine, pH 7.4) and brought to 180-μl final volume in this assay medium. Bioenergetic measurements were interpreted and performed as described (42Dranka B.P. Benavides G.A. Diers A.R. Giordano S. Zelickson B.R. Reily C. Zou L. Chatham J.C. Hill B.G. Zhang J. Landar A.

In short, the basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured for 24 min after which oligomycin (1 μg/ml), carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (0.6 μm), and antimycin A (10 μm) were injected sequentially. The extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) was measured simultaneously. This assay was performed on the Extracellular Analyzer as adapted from Salabei et al. (43Salabei J.K. Gibb A.A. Hill B.G. Comprehensive measurement of respiratory activity in permeabilized cells using extracellular flux analysis.Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9: 421-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In short, cells were washed and brought to 180-μl final volume in mannitol and sucrose (MAS) buffer (70 mm sucrose, 220 mm mannitol, 10 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.2). After three basal measurements were acquired, saponin (30 μg/ml) together with pyruvate (5 mm), malate (2.5 mm), and ADP (1 mm) were injected. Sequentially rotenone (1 μm), succinate (10 mm), ADP (1 mm), and then antimycin A (10 μm) were injected. After cell harvesting, lung fibroblasts were mixed at a density of 2·105 cells/ml in a solution composed of 8 volumes of rat tail collagen type I (BD Biosciences), 1 volume of 10× Ham's F-12 (Life Technologies), and 1 volume of reconstitution buffer (2% NaHCO3, 4.77% HEPES). The solution was poured into a 24-well plate (0.5 ml/well), and gelation was performed at 37 °C for 30 min. Gels were then overlaid with 1.5 ml of 1% serum-containing cell culture medium. The next day gels were treated with or without TGF-β1. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad software. The data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made by performing unpaired Student's t tests unless otherwise indicated. To determine potential changes in cellular bioenergetics in TGF-β1-differentiated myofibroblasts, we analyzed OCRs and ECARs of normal human diploid lung fibroblasts (IMR-90) treated without or with TGF-β1 (2.5 ng/ml for 48 h) (3Thannickal V.J. Lee D.Y. White E.S. Cui Z. Larios J.M. Chacon R. Horowitz J.C. Day R.M. Thomas P.E.

Chem. 2003; 278: 12384-12389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 enhanced overall bioenergetics with a marked increase in basal OCR, ATP-linked respiration, maximal and reserve capacity, proton leak, and non-mitochondrial OCR (Fig. 1, A and C). Furthermore, TGF-β1 also increased ECAR from 16 ± 0.23 milli-pH units/min/10,000 cells in the unstimulated state to 30 ± 0.55 milli-pH units/min/10,000 cells in the TGF-β1-stimulated state (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, when mitochondrial ATP production was inhibited with oligomycin, the increase in ECAR was 63% higher in the TGF-β1-treated cells compared with the control, consistent with a greater capacity for glycolysis (Fig. 1B). Plotting OCR as a function of ECAR showed TGF-β1-induced metabolic reprogramming with induction of mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis resulting in a condition of aerobic glycolysis (Fig. 1D). The increase in mitochondrial respiration could be due to an increase either in mitochondrial mass or in substrate supply to the electron transport chain. To delineate the mechanism of this increase in mitochondrial respiration, the functioning of complex I or II was measured using a mitochondrial assay where the plasma membrane of fibroblasts was permeabilized and exogenous respiratory substrates were delivered to the electron transport chain. In this assay, after basal OCR was measured, saponin, ADP, succinate (complex II-linked substrate), pyruvate, and malate (complex I-linked substrate) were injected to stimulate respiration (Fig. 1E). Next, rotenone was injected to quantify complex I-linked respiration followed by antimycin A to measure complex II-linked respiration. TGF-β1 induced a small, but significant, increase in complex I-linked respiration without a significant change in complex II-linked OCR at 48 h after treatment (Fig. 1E). Next, we determined whether TGF-β1-induced mitochondrial biogenesis is associated with alterations in mitochondrial distribution and abundance. Staining of the mitochondrial compartment (with the fluorescent dye MitoTracker) demonstrated that the mitochondrial population was relatively homogeneous and mainly localized to the perinuclear region in unstimulated cells; in contrast, there was an apparent increase in mitochondrial abundance with a more diffuse cytoplasmic staining in TGF-β1-differentiated myofibroblasts (Fig. 2A). To determine whether these apparent changes in mitochondrial abundance are linked to mitochondrial biogenesis, we analyzed the effect of TGF-β1 on the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis markers. TGF-β1 induced a time-dependent increase in phosphorylated PGC-1α, a transcriptional co-activator that regulates nuclearly encoded mitochondrial genes (16Wu Z. Puigserver P. Andersson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G. Mootha V. Troy A. Cinti S. Lowell B. Scarpulla R.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mechanisms controlling mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration through the thermogenic coactivator PGC-1.Cell. 1999; 98: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3176) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Phosphorylation of PGC-1α occurred as early as 15 min after exposure to TGF-β1. Phosphorylation of PGC-1α was increased by 9.71-fold (n = 4, p < 0.05) compared with baseline following 48-h treatment with TGF-β1. VDAC resides in the outer membrane of the mitochondria where it participates in metabolism and, under conditions of stress, in the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (44Baines C.P.

https://openalex.org/W1894162067,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene. Because this gene is expressed ubiquitously, it remains poorly understood why motor neurons (MNs) are one of the most affected cell types. To address this question, we carried out RNA sequencing studies using fixed, antibody-labeled, and purified MNs produced from control and SMA patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We found SMA-specific changes in MNs, including hyper-activation of the ER stress pathway. Functional studies demonstrated that inhibition of ER stress improves MN survival in vitro even in MNs expressing low SMN. In SMA mice, systemic delivery of an ER stress inhibitor that crosses the blood-brain barrier led to the preservation of spinal cord MNs. Therefore, our study implies that selective activation of ER stress underlies MN death in SMA. Moreover, the approach we have taken would be broadly applicable to the study of disease-prone human cells in heterogeneous cultures."

Subjects were adjusted to ultra-long-acting insulin Degludec (Tresiba/ Novo Nordisk, Denmark). Before exercise, standardized meals were administered, and short-acting insulin dose was reduced by 25% (A), 50% (B), and 75% (C) dependent on mean exercise intensity. During exercise, BG, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, cortisol, glucagon, and insulin-like growth factor-1, blood lactate, heart rate, and gas exchange variables were measured. For 24 h after exercise, interstitial glucose was measured by continuous glucose monitoring system.BG decrease during HIIE was significantly smaller for B (p = 0.024) and tended to be smaller for A and C compared to CON. No differences were found for post-exercise interstitial glucose, acute hormone response, and carbohydrate utilization between HIIE and CON for A, B, and C. In HIIE, blood lactate for A (p = 0.006) and B (p = 0.004) and respiratory exchange ratio for A (p = 0.003) and B (p = 0.003) were significantly higher compared to CON but not for C.Hypoglycemia did not occur during or after HIIE and CON when using ultra-long-acting insulin and applying our methodological approach for exercise prescription. HIIE led to a smaller BG decrease compared to CON, although both exercises modes were matched for mean load and duration, even despite markedly higher peak workloads applied in HIIE. Therefore, HIIE and CON could be safely performed in T1DM.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02075567 http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02075567."

Here we show that Ldb1 is a central regulator of genome organization in cardiac progenitor cells, which is crucial for cardiac lineage differentiation and heart development. We demonstrate that Ldb1 binds to the key regulator of cardiac progenitors, Isl1, and protects it from degradation. Furthermore, the Isl1/Ldb1 complex promotes long-range enhancer-promoter interactions at the loci of the core cardiac transcription factors Mef2c and Hand2. Chromosome conformation capture followed by sequencing identified specific Ldb1-mediated interactions of the Isl1/Ldb1 responsive Mef2c anterior heart field enhancer with genes that play key roles in cardiac progenitor cell function and cardiovascular development. Importantly, the expression of these genes was downregulated upon Ldb1 depletion and Isl1/Ldb1 haplodeficiency. In conclusion, the Isl1/Ldb1 complex orchestrates a network for heart-specific transcriptional regulation and coordination in three-dimensional space during cardiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1738168289,"Better knowledge of the uremic solutes that accumulate when the kidneys fail could lead to improved renal replacement therapy. This study employed the largest widely available metabolomic platform to identify such solutes. Plasma and plasma ultrafiltrate from 6 maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients and 6 normal controls were first compared using a platform combining gas and liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. Further studies compared plasma from 6 HD patients who had undergone total colectomy and 9 with intact colons. We identified 120 solutes as uremic including 48 that had not been previously reported to accumulate in renal failure. Combination of the 48 newly identified solutes with those identified in previous reports yielded an extended list of more than 270 uremic solutes. Among the solutes identified as uremic in the current study, 9 were shown to be colon-derived, including 6 not previously identified as such. Literature search revealed that many uremic phenyl and indole solutes, including most of those shown to be colon-derived, come from plant foods. Some of these compounds can be absorbed directly from plant foods and others are produced by colon microbial metabolism of plant polyphenols that escape digestion in the small intestine. A limitation of the metabolomic method was that it underestimated the elevation in concentration of uremic solutes which were measured using more quantitative assays."

Parapapillary gamma zone was defined as the parapapillary region without Bruch's membrane. We additionally measured ocular biometric parameters and assessed non-ophthalmologic variables.Measurements of MacBMLength were performed on 322 individuals. MacBMLength (mean: 3.99 ± 0.33 mm; range: 3.17-4.93 mm) was not significantly associated with any systemic parameter or ocular biometric parameter. Gamma zone width (mean: 0.18 ± 0.30 mm; range: 0.00-2.61 mm) was associated (multivariate analysis; correlation coefficient r:0.80) with longer axial length (P<0.001; standardized correlation coefficient beta: 0.60; non-standardized correlation coefficient B:0.11; 95%CI: 0.09,0.14) and with longer fovea-optic disc border distance (P<0.001; beta:0.28; B:0.19; 95%CI:0.14,0.25), but not with MacBMLength (P = 0.42). Fovea-temporal disc border distance (mean: 4.16 ± 0.44 mm; range: 3.17-5.86 mm) was associated (overall correlation coefficient: 0.68) with longer axial length (P<0.001; beta: 0.36; B: 0.10; 95%CI: 0.06, 0.13), after adjusting for flatter anterior chamber depth (P = 0.003; beta:-0.14; B:-0.14; 95%CI: -0.23,-0.05) and wider parapapillary gamma zone (P<0.001; beta:0.42; B:0.62; 95%CI:0.44,0.81).In contrast to parapapillary gamma zone width and fovea-disc border distance, MacBMLength was not significantly associated with axial length. Axial elongation associated increase in fovea-disc distance may predominantly occur through development or elongation of parapapillary gamma zone, while macular Bruch´s membrane may mostly be independent of axial elongation."
https://openalex.org/W2266729923,"The first step in the mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway is catalyzed by sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQR), which belongs to the family of flavoprotein disulfide oxidoreductases. During the catalytic cycle, the flavin cofactor is intermittently reduced by sulfide and oxidized by ubiquinone, linking H2S oxidation to the electron transfer chain and to energy metabolism. Human SQR can use multiple thiophilic acceptors, including sulfide, sulfite, and glutathione, to form as products, hydrodisulfide, thiosulfate, and glutathione persulfide, respectively. In this study, we have used transient kinetics to examine the mechanism of the flavin reductive half-reaction and have determined the redox potential of the bound flavin to be −123 ± 7 mV. We observe formation of an unusually intense charge-transfer (CT) complex when the enzyme is exposed to sulfide and unexpectedly, when it is exposed to sulfite. In the canonical reaction, sulfide serves as the sulfur donor and sulfite serves as the acceptor, forming thiosulfate. We show that thiosulfate is also formed when sulfide is added to the sulfite-induced CT intermediate, representing a new mechanism for thiosulfate formation. The CT complex is formed at a kinetically competent rate by reaction with sulfide but not with sulfite. Our study indicates that sulfide addition to the active site disulfide is preferred under normal turnover conditions. However, under pathological conditions when sulfite concentrations are high, sulfite could compete with sulfide for addition to the active site disulfide, leading to attenuation of SQR activity and to an alternate route for thiosulfate formation."
https://openalex.org/W1912903072,"This study examined the relationship between income and physical activity by using three measures to illustrate daily physical activity: the self-reported physical activity index for leisure-time physical activity, pedometer-based total steps for overall daily physical activity, and pedometer-based aerobic steps that reflect continuous steps for more than 10 min at a time. The study population consisted of 753 adults from Finland (mean age 41.7 years; 64% women) who participated in 2011 in the follow-up of the ongoing Young Finns study. Ordinary least squares models were used to evaluate the associations between income and physical activity. The consistency of the results was explored by using register-based income information from Statistics Finland, employing the instrumental variable approach, and dividing the pedometer-based physical activity according to weekdays and weekend days. The results indicated that higher income was associated with higher self-reported physical activity for both genders. The results were robust to the inclusion of the control variables and the use of register-based income information. However, the pedometer-based results were gender-specific and depended on the measurement day (weekday vs. weekend day). In more detail, the association was positive for women and negative or non-existing for men. According to the measurement day, among women, income was positively associated with aerobic steps despite the measurement day and with totals steps measured on the weekend. Among men, income was negatively associated with aerobic steps measured on weekdays. The results indicate that there is an association between income and physical activity, but the association is gender-specific and depends on the measurement type of physical activity."
https://openalex.org/W2239495151,"Ceramide synthases (CerS1–CerS6), which catalyze the N-acylation of the (dihydro)sphingosine backbone to produce (dihydro)ceramide in both the de novo and the salvage or recycling pathway of ceramide generation, have been implicated in the control of programmed cell death. However, the regulation of the de novo pathway compared with the salvage pathway is not fully understood. In the current study, we have found that late accumulation of multiple ceramide and dihydroceramide species in MCF-7 cells treated with TNFα occurred by up-regulation of both pathways of ceramide synthesis. Nevertheless, fumonisin B1 but not myriocin was able to protect from TNFα-induced cell death, suggesting that ceramide synthase activity is crucial for the progression of cell death and that the pool of ceramide involved derives from the salvage pathway rather than de novo biosynthesis. Furthermore, compared with control cells, TNFα-treated cells exhibited reduced focal adhesion kinase and subsequent plasma membrane permeabilization, which was blocked exclusively by fumonisin B1. In addition, exogenously added C6-ceramide mimicked the effects of TNFα that lead to cell death, which were inhibited by fumonisin B1. Knockdown of individual ceramide synthases identified CerS6 and its product C16-ceramide as the ceramide synthase isoform essential for the regulation of cell death. In summary, our data suggest a novel role for CerS6/C16-ceramide as an upstream effector of the loss of focal adhesion protein and plasma membrane permeabilization, via the activation of caspase-7, and identify the salvage pathway as the critical mechanism of ceramide generation that controls cell death.

https://openalex.org/W1957340350,"Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) is currently the most sensitive technique used for absolute and relative quantification of a target gene transcript, requiring the use of appropriated reference genes for data normalization. To accurately estimate the relative expression of target tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) genes responsive to several virus species in reverse transcription qPCR analysis, the identification of reliable reference genes is mandatory. In the present study, ten reference genes were analyzed across a set of eight samples: two tomato contrasting genotypes ('Santa Clara', susceptible, and its near-isogenic line 'LAM 157', resistant); subjected to two treatments (inoculation with Tomato chlorotic mottle virus (ToCMoV) and its mock-inoculated control) and in two distinct times after inoculation (early and late). Reference genes stability was estimated by three statistical programs (geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper). To validate the results over broader experimental conditions, a set of ten samples, corresponding to additional three tomato-virus pathosystems that included tospovirus, crinivirus and tymovirus + tobamovirus, was analyzed together with the tomato-ToCMoV pathosystem dataset, using the same algorithms. Taking into account the combined analyses of the ranking order outputs from the three algorithms, TIP41 and EF1 were identified as the most stable genes for tomato-ToCMoV pathosystem, and TIP41 and EXP for the four pathosystems together, and selected to be used as reference in the forthcoming expression qPCR analysis of target genes in experimental conditions involving the aforementioned tomato-virus pathosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2118932150,"Metabolic homeostasis is critical for all biological processes in the brain. The metabolites are considered the best indicators of cell states and their rapid fluxes are extremely sensitive to cellular changes. While there are a few studies on the metabolomics of Parkinson's disease, it lacks longitudinal studies of the brain metabolic pathways affected by aging and the disease. Using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectroscopy (UPLC/MS), we generated the metabolomics profiling data from the brains of young and aged male PD-related α-synuclein A53T transgenic mice as well as the age- and gender-matched non-transgenic (nTg) controls. Principal component and unsupervised hierarchical clustering analyses identified distinctive metabolites influenced by aging and the A53T mutation. The following metabolite set enrichment classification revealed the alanine metabolism, redox and acetyl-CoA biosynthesis pathways were substantially disturbed in the aged mouse brains regardless of the genotypes, suggesting that aging plays a more prominent role in the alterations of brain metabolism. Further examination showed that the interaction effect of aging and genotype only disturbed the guanosine levels. The young A53T mice exhibited lower levels of guanosine compared to the age-matched nTg controls. The guanosine levels remained constant between the young and aged nTg mice, whereas the aged A53T mice showed substantially increased guanosine levels compared to the young mutant ones. In light of the neuroprotective function of guanosine, our findings suggest that the increase of guanosine metabolism in aged A53T mice likely represents a protective mechanism against neurodegeneration, while monitoring guanosine levels could be applicable to the early diagnosis of the disease."

Development of patient-specific in vitro models that efficiently and faithfully reproduce the in vivo phenotype may provide a means to develop personalized therapies for this diverse carcinoma. Studies to maintain and model tumor phenotypes in vitro were conducted with emerging three-dimensional culture techniques and natural scaffolding materials. Human renal cell carcinomas were individually characterized by histology, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative PCR to establish the characteristics of each tumor. Isolated cells were cultured on renal extracellular matrix and compared to a novel polysaccharide scaffold to assess cell-scaffold interactions, development of organoids, and maintenance of gene expression signatures over time in culture. Renal cell carcinomas cultured on renal extracellular matrix repopulated tubules or vessel lumens in renal pyramids and medullary rays, but cells were not observed in glomeruli or outer cortical regions of the scaffold. In the polysaccharide scaffold, renal cell carcinomas formed aggregates that were loosely attached to the scaffold or free-floating within the matrix. Molecular analysis of cell-scaffold constructs including immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR demonstrated that individual tumor phenotypes could be sustained for up to 21 days in culture on both scaffolds, and in comparison to outcomes in two-dimensional monolayer cultures. The use of three-dimensional scaffolds to engineer a personalized in vitro renal cell carcinoma model provides opportunities to advance understanding of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W1948611833,"Emerging fungal and oomycete pathogens are increasingly threatening animals and plants globally. Amongst oomycetes, Saprolegnia species adversely affect wild and cultivated populations of amphibians and fish, leading to substantial reductions in biodiversity and food productivity. With the ban of several chemical control measures, new sustainable methods are needed to mitigate Saprolegnia infections in aquaculture. Here, PhyloChip-based community analyses showed that the Pseudomonadales, particularly Pseudomonas species, represent one of the largest bacterial orders associated with salmon eggs from a commercial hatchery. Among the Pseudomonas species isolated from salmon eggs, significantly more biosurfactant producers were retrieved from healthy salmon eggs than from Saprolegnia-infected eggs. Subsequent in vivo activity bioassays showed that Pseudomonas isolate H6 significantly reduced salmon egg mortality caused by Saprolegnia diclina. Live colony mass spectrometry showed that strain H6 produces a viscosin-like lipopeptide surfactant. This biosurfactant inhibited growth of Saprolegnia in vitro, but no significant protection of salmon eggs against Saprolegniosis was observed. These results indicate that live inocula of aquatic Pseudomonas strains, instead of their bioactive compound, can provide new (micro)biological and sustainable means to mitigate oomycete diseases in aquaculture."
https://openalex.org/W2165119851,"Apart from their role in cellular immunity via phagocytosis and encapsulation, Drosophila hemocytes release soluble factors such as antimicrobial peptides, and cytokines to induce humoral responses. In addition, they participate in coagulation and wounding, and in development. To assess their role during infection with entomopathogenic nematodes, we depleted plasmatocytes and crystal cells, the two classes of hemocytes present in naïve larvae by expressing proapoptotic proteins in order to produce hemocyte-free (Hml-apo, originally called Hemoless) larvae. Surprisingly, we found that Hml-apo larvae are still resistant to nematode infections. When further elucidating the immune status of Hml-apo larvae, we observe a shift in immune effector pathways including massive lamellocyte differentiation and induction of Toll- as well as repression of imd signaling. This leads to a pro-inflammatory state, characterized by the appearance of melanotic nodules in the hemolymph and to strong developmental defects including pupal lethality and leg defects in escapers. Further analysis suggests that most of the phenotypes we observe in Hml-apo larvae are alleviated by administration of antibiotics and by changing the food source indicating that they are mediated through the microbiota. Biochemical evidence identifies nitric oxide as a key phylogenetically conserved regulator in this process. Finally we show that the nitric oxide donor L-arginine similarly modifies the response against an early stage of tumor development in fly larvae."
https://openalex.org/W2252659026,"Fibronectin (Fn) is a promiscuous ligand for numerous cell adhesion receptors or integrins. The vast majority of Fn-integrin interactions are mediated through the Fn Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif located within the tenth type III repeat. In the case of integrins αIIbβ3 and α5β1, the integrin binds RGD and the synergy site (PHSRN) located within the adjacent ninth type III repeat. Prior work has shown that these synergy-dependent integrins are exquisitely sensitive to perturbations in the Fn integrin binding domain conformation. Our own prior studies of epithelial cell responses to recombinant fragments of the Fn integrin binding domain led us to hypothesize that integrin α3β1 binding may also be modulated by the synergy site. To explore this hypothesis, we created a variety of recombinant variants of the Fn integrin binding domain: (i) a previously reported (Leu → Pro) stabilizing mutant (FnIII9′10), (ii) an Arg to Ala synergy site mutation (FnIII9R→A10), (iii) a two-Gly (FnIII92G10) insertion, and (iv) a four-Gly (FNIII94G10) insertion in the interdomain linker region and used surface plasmon resonance to determine binding kinetics of integrin α3β1 to the Fn fragments. Integrin α3β1 had the highest affinity for FnIII9′10 and FnIII92G10. Mutation within the synergy site decreased integrin α3β1 binding 17-fold, and the four-Gly insertion decreased binding 39-fold compared with FnIII9′10. Cell attachment studies demonstrate that α3β1-mediated epithelial cell binding is greater on FnIII9′10 compared with the other fragments.

https://openalex.org/W2141033930,"Children using unilateral cochlear implants abnormally rely on tempo rather than mode cues to distinguish whether a musical piece is happy or sad. This led us to question how this judgment is affected by the type of experience in early auditory development. We hypothesized that judgments of the emotional content of music would vary by the type and duration of access to sound in early life due to deafness, altered perception of musical cues through new ways of using auditory prostheses bilaterally, and formal music training during childhood. Seventy-five participants completed the Montreal Emotion Identification Test. Thirty-three had normal hearing (aged 6.6 to 40.0 years) and 42 children had hearing loss and used bilateral auditory prostheses (31 bilaterally implanted and 11 unilaterally implanted with contralateral hearing aid use). Reaction time and accuracy were measured. Accurate judgment of emotion in music was achieved across ages and musical experience. Musical training accentuated the reliance on mode cues which developed with age in the normal hearing group. Degrading pitch cues through cochlear implant-mediated hearing induced greater reliance on tempo cues, but mode cues grew in salience when at least partial acoustic information was available through some residual hearing in the contralateral ear. Finally, when pitch cues were experimentally distorted to represent cochlear implant hearing, individuals with normal hearing (including those with musical training) switched to an abnormal dependence on tempo cues. The data indicate that, in a western culture, access to acoustic hearing in early life promotes a preference for mode rather than tempo cues which is enhanced by musical training. The challenge to these preferred strategies during cochlear implant hearing (simulated and real), regardless of musical training, suggests that access to pitch cues for children with hearing loss must be improved by preservation of residual hearing and improvements in cochlear implant technology."
https://openalex.org/W2255030827,"The role of the outermost transmembrane α-helix in both the maturation and function of the prokaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, GLIC and ELIC, was examined by Ala scanning mutagenesis, deletion mutations, and mutant cycle analyses. Ala mutations at the M4-M1/M3 interface lead to loss-of-function phenotypes in GLIC, with the largest negative effects occurring near the M4 C terminus. In particular, two aromatic residues at the M4 C terminus form a network of π-π and/or cation-π interactions with residues on M3 and the β6-β7 loop that is essential for both maturation and function. M4-M1/M3 interactions appear to be optimized in GLIC with even subtle structural changes at this interface leading to detrimental effects. In contrast, mutations along the M4-M1/M3 interface of ELIC typically lead to gain-of-function phenotypes, suggesting that these interactions in ELIC are not optimized for channel function. In addition, no cluster of interacting residues involving the M4 C terminus, M3, and the β6-β7 loop was found, suggesting that the M4 C terminus plays little role in ELIC maturation or function. This study shows that M4 makes distinct contributions to the maturation and gating of these two closely related homologs, suggesting that GLIC and ELIC exhibit divergent features of channel function."

The large substrate-induced conformational rearrangement in MCM lies in stark contrast to the more subtle conformational changes that occur upon substrate binding in a different AdoCbl-dependent enzyme, glutamate mutase. Here, the ribose of the AdoCbl 5′-deoxyadenosyl group (5′-dAdo) undergoes pseudorotation from the C2′-endo conformation to the C3′-endo conformation when substrate binds, breaking the Co–C bond and repositioning the resulting 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical for hydrogen atom abstraction from substrate (33Gruber K. Reitzer R. Kratky C. Radical shuttling in a protein: ribose pseudorotation controls alkyl-radical transfer in the coenzyme B12-dependent enzyme glutamate mutase.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

No structural data exist as to whether the same change in ribose conformation is involved in reactivity of MCM or other acyl-CoA mutases. Given the limited number of mutases that have been structurally characterized, we still have much to learn about how these enzymes generate and control the highly reactive 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical upon substrate binding. Furthermore, to engineer mutases for biotechnological applications, an understanding of the substrate binding determinants will also be required. Substrate-bound structures of MCM (25Mancia F.

We recently reported crystal structures of IcmF from Cupriavidus metallidurans, which contains a G-protein domain in addition to the mutase domains, with AdoCbl in the ICM active site and GDP·Mg2+ in the G-protein active site (holo-IcmF·GDP) but without acyl-CoA substrates (28Jost M.

Here, we report crystal structures of IcmF bound to AdoCbl, GDP·Mg2+, and all four known acyl-CoA substrates (pivalyl-CoA, isovaleryl-CoA, isobutyryl-CoA, and n-butyryl-CoA), revealing the mode of substrate binding and the determinants of substrate specificity in IcmF. Guided by the structural insight and bioinformatic analyses, we identify two classes of acyl-CoA mutases that likely catalyze novel AdoCbl-dependent reactions. Isobutyryl-CoA, n-butyryl-CoA, and isovaleryl-CoA were obtained from Sigma. Pivalyl-CoA was synthesized in a one-step procedure from pivalic anhydride (Sigma) and CoA (Sigma) (Fig. 2). Briefly, to a solution of 0.20 mmol of pivalic anhydride (40.6 μl) in 2 ml of anhydrous dimethylformamide were added 0.040 mmol of solid CoA hydrate (32 mg), 0.12 mmol of triethylamine (16.8 μl), and a catalytic amount of dimethylaminopyridine. The reaction was stirred for 30 min at 25 °C. Reaction progress was followed by thin layer chromatography in 1:1:1:1 1-butanol/acetic acid/ethyl acetate/water. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.10 mmol of HCl followed by dilution with water, and the water/dimethylformamide mixture was removed by lyophilization. The solid product was dissolved in 400 μl of 95:5 water/acetonitrile and purified by HPLC on a 250 × 10-mm Targa C18 (5-μm pore size) reversed-phase column (Higgins Analytical).

Purified IcmF was supplemented with AdoCbl (Sigma), GDP (Sigma), and MgCl2 to generate holo-IcmF·GDP and crystallized at 25 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. 1 μl of a protein solution (11.7 mg/ml IcmF in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm GDP, 3 mm MgCl2, 300 μm AdoCbl) was mixed with 1 μl of a precipitant solution (0.7–0.75 m potassium sodium tartrate, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 0.1 m imidazole, pH 7.0–7.7, 3% (v/v) ethylene glycol) on a glass coverslip. The coverslip was sealed with grease over a reservoir containing 500 μl of the precipitant solution without ethylene glycol. Triangular crystals appeared within 3 weeks and grew to full size within 6 weeks. To generate crystals of holo-IcmF·GDP bound to n-butyryl-CoA, isobutyryl-CoA, isovaleryl-CoA, or pivalyl-CoA, pre-formed holo-IcmF·GDP crystals were transferred to 2 μl of a soak solution containing the precipitant, 2 mm GDP, 3 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm of the corresponding substrate in three steps of about 30 s each, with successive increases in the substrate concentration from 1.25 to 2.5 to 5 mm. After soaking, crystals were transferred in two steps of increasing glycerol concentration into a cryogenic solution containing the precipitant, 2 mm GDP, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm substrate, and 20% (v/v) glycerol, incubated in that solution for 15 s, and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. All crystallization and soaking procedures were carried out in a dark room under red light to prevent cleavage of the AdoCbl Co–C bond before ligand binding. All IcmF crystals belong to space group R32 (denoted as H32 by the PDB). All data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL) at beamline 24ID-C at a temperature of 100 K and a wavelength of 0.9795 Å (12,658 eV). Data for holo-IcmF·GDP bound to isobutyryl-CoA, n-butyryl-CoA, and isovaleryl-CoA were collected using a Quantum 315 detector in 0.5° (isobutyryl-CoA) or 1° oscillation steps (n-butyryl-CoA and isovaleryl-CoA). Data for holo-IcmF·GDP bound to pivalyl-CoA were collected using a Pilatus 6MF detector in wedges of 20° in 0.5° oscillation steps. The crystal was displaced along its major macroscopic axis after each wedge. All data were integrated in XDS and scaled in XSCALE (35Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Preoperative high-resolution computer tomography (HRCT) images were available and reviewed in 5,439 lung ADC patients since 2005. Time trends of the ADC proportion of lung cancer cases, gender distribution, age at diagnosis, the proportion of early-stage ADC and imaging features were investigated.The proportion of ADC increased during the 14 years (P = 0.000). The ratio of female to male ADC cases was higher than both squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC) and total lung cancer cases (P = 0.000). The median age at diagnosis of ADC patients was younger than that of both SQCC and total lung cancer during the 14 years (P = 0.000). The proportion of age group 45-59 years increased in total lung cancer cases (P = 0.000). When stratified by lung cancer histopathologic subtypes, this trend was also observed in ADC (P = 0.001) and SQCC (P = 0.007). The proportion of early-stage cases of ADC increased from 2008 to 2012 (P < 0.001). The proportion of subsolid nodules (SSN) in ADC increased (P = 0.001) from 2005 to 2012.The data suggests that the proportion of ADC increased from 1999 to 2012 especially in middle-aged, female patients; early-stage ADC and SSN on HRCT images gradually increased, which may have been caused by a change in smoking habits and increased application of HRCT."
https://openalex.org/W2167830149,"Nearly 50% of the horses participating in endurance events are eliminated at a veterinary examination (a vet gate). Detecting unfit horses before a health problem occurs and treatment is required is a challenge for veterinarians but is essential for improving equine welfare. We hypothesized that it would be possible to detect unfit horses earlier in the event by measuring heart rate recovery variables. Hence, the objective of the present study was to compute logistic regressions of heart rate, cardiac recovery time and average speed data recorded at the previous vet gate (n-1) and thus predict the probability of elimination during successive phases (n and following) in endurance events. Speed and heart rate data were extracted from an electronic database of endurance events (80-160 km in length) organized in four countries. Overall, 39% of the horses that started an event were eliminated--mostly due to lameness (64%) or metabolic disorders (15%). For each vet gate, logistic regressions of explanatory variables (average speed, cardiac recovery time and heart rate measured at the previous vet gate) and categorical variables (age and/or event distance) were computed to estimate the probability of elimination. The predictive logistic regressions for vet gates 2 to 5 correctly classified between 62% and 86% of the eliminated horses. The robustness of these results was confirmed by high areas under the receiving operating characteristic curves (0.68-0.84). Overall, a horse has a 70% chance of being eliminated at the next gate if its cardiac recovery time is longer than 11 min at vet gate 1 or 2, or longer than 13 min at vet gates 3 or 4. Heart rate recovery and average speed variables measured at the previous vet gate(s) enabled us to predict elimination at the following vet gate. These variables should be checked at each veterinary examination, in order to detect unfit horses as early as possible. Our predictive method may help to improve equine welfare and ethical considerations in endurance events."
https://openalex.org/W1666636854,"It has been considered that the detection methods for circulating tumor cells (CTCs) based on epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) underestimate the number of CTCs and may miss a metastatic subpopulation with cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. Therefore, we investigated EpCAM-positive and -negative CTCs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients at different stages, assessed the clinical value of these CTCs and explored their capacity in the following CSC model.CTCs were enriched by the depletion of leukocytes with bi-antibodies using a magnetic bead separation technique and then identified by the expression of EpCAM and cytokeratin 7 and 8 using multi-parameter flow cytometry. We determined the distribution of CTCs classified by the expression of EpCAM in 46 NSCLC patients with stages I to IV, assessed the diagnostic value of these CTCs by longitudinal monitoring in 4 index patients during adjuvant therapy and characterized the stemness of these CTCs by the expression of CXCR4 and CD133 in 10 patients.EpCAM-negative (E-) CTCs were detected to be significantly higher than EpCAM-positive (E+) CTCs in stage IV (p = 0.003). The patients with the percentage of E-CTCs more than 95% (r > 95%) were detected to be significantly increased from 13.3% in stage I-II to 61.1% in stage IV (p = 0.006). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the patients with r > 95% had significantly shorter survival time than those with r ≤ 0.95 (p = 0.041). Longitudinal monitoring of CTCs indicated that the patients with a high percentage of E-CTCs in the blood were not responsive to either chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Further characterization of CTCs revealed that a stem-like subpopulation of CXCR4+CD133+ CTCs were detected to be significantly more prevalent in E-CTCs than that in E+CTCs (p = 0.005).The enrichment of CTCs by the depletion of leukocytes with bi-antibodies is a valuable method for estimating the number of CTCs, which can be potentially applied in predicting the prognosis, monitoring the therapeutic effect of NSCLC patients and further analyzing the biology of CTCs."

The prevalence and consequences of good vs. poor adjustment (resilience vs. vulnerability) following encounters with violence were also examined. Data were based on the sixth wave of the ""Tromsø Study"" (N = 12,981; 65.7% response rate, 53.4% women, M-age = 57.5 years, SD-age = 12.7 years). Self-reported data on psychological (threats) and physical violence (beaten/kicked), mental health (anxiety/depression), musculoskeletal pain (MSP), and granting of disability pension (DP) were collected. Men suffered more violent events during childhood than women did, and vice versa during adulthood. Psychological violence implied poorer mental health and slightly more MSP than physical violence. The risk of MSP was highest for violence occurring during childhood in women and during the last year for men. A dose-response relationship between an increasing number of violent encounters and poorer health was observed. About 58% of individuals reported no negative impact of violence (hence, resilience group), whereas 42% considered themselves as more vulnerable following encounters with violence. Regression analyses indicated comparable mental health but slightly more MSP in the resilience group compared to the unexposed group, whereas the vulnerable group had significantly worse health overall and a higher risk of early granting of DP. Resilience is not an all-or-nothing matter, as physical ailments may characterize individuals adapting well following encounters with violence."
https://openalex.org/W1961681902,"Environmental perturbations can affect the health, welfare, and fitness of animals. Being able to characterize and phenotype adaptive capacity is therefore of growing scientific concern in animal ecology and in animal production sciences. Terms borrowed from physics are commonly used to describe adaptive responses of animals facing an environmental perturbation, but no quantitative characterization of these responses has been made. Modeling the dynamic responses to an acute challenge was used in this study to facilitate the characterization of adaptive capacity and therefore robustness. A simple model based on a spring and damper was developed to simulate the dynamic responses of animals facing an acute challenge. The parameters characterizing the spring and the damper can be interpreted in terms of stiffness and resistance to the change of the system. The model was tested on physiological and behavioral responses of rainbow trout facing an acute confinement challenge. The model has proven to properly fit the different responses measured in this study and to quantitatively describe the different temporal patterns for each statistical individual in the study. It provides therefore a new way to explicitly describe, analyze and compare responses of individuals facing an acute perturbation. This study suggests that such physical models may be usefully applied to characterize robustness in many other biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W2153578531,"Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, alters its gene expression in response to environmental signals unique to its tick vector or vertebrate hosts. B. burgdorferi carries one superoxide dismutase gene (sodA) capable of controlling intracellular superoxide levels. Previously, sodA was shown to be essential for infection of B. burgdorferi in the C3H/HeN model of Lyme disease. We employed two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific to carbonylated proteins to identify targets that were differentially oxidized in the soluble fractions of the sodA mutant compared to its isogenic parental control strain following treatment with an endogenous superoxide generator, methyl viologen (MV, paraquat). HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of oxidized proteins revealed that several proteins of the glycolytic pathway (BB0057, BB0020, BB0348) exhibited increased carbonylation in the sodA mutant treated with MV. Levels of ATP and NAD/NADH were reduced in the sodA mutant compared with the parental strain following treatment with MV and could be attributed to increased levels of oxidation of proteins of the glycolytic pathway. In addition, a chaperone, HtpG (BB0560), and outer surface protein A (OspA, BBA15) were also observed to be oxidized in the sodA mutant. Immunoblot analysis revealed reduced levels of Outer surface protein C (OspC), Decorin binding protein A (DbpA), fibronectin binding protein (BBK32), RpoS and BosR in the sodA mutant compared to the control strains. Viable sodA mutant spirochetes could not be recovered from both gp91/phox-⁄- and iNOS deficient mice while borrelial DNA was detected in multiple tissues samples from infected mice at significantly lower levels compared to the parental strain. Taken together, these observations indicate that the increased oxidation of select borrelial determinants and reduced levels of critical pathogenesis-associated lipoproteins contribute to the in vivo deficit of the sodA mutant in the mouse model of Lyme disease. This study, utilizing the sodA mutant, has provided insights into adaptive capabilities critical for survival of B. burgdorferi in its hosts."

Here, we show that Plasmodium falciparum and other apicomplexans possess a unique heterodimeric glutamyl-tRNA amidotransferase consisting of GatA and GatB subunits (GatAB). We localized the P. falciparum GatA and GatB subunits to the apicoplast in blood stage parasites and demonstrated that recombinant GatAB converts Glu-tRNA(Gln) to Gln-tRNA(Gln) in vitro. We demonstrate that the apicoplast GatAB-catalyzed reaction is essential to the parasite blood stages because we could not delete the Plasmodium berghei gene encoding GatA in blood stage parasites in vivo. A phylogenetic analysis placed the split between Plasmodium GatB, archaeal GatE, and bacterial GatB prior to the phylogenetic divide between bacteria and archaea. Moreover, Plasmodium GatA also appears to have emerged prior to the bacterial-archaeal phylogenetic divide. Thus, although GatAB is found in Plasmodium, it emerged prior to the phylogenetic separation of archaea and bacteria."

We applied this system for the detection of the IS6110 insertion sequence of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB) and evaluated its feasibility for use in molecular diagnostics. Fifty-four sputum specimens were collected at our institution from October 2010 to March 2012. To detect MTB in the samples, we performed PCR amplification of the IS6110 DNA sequence using FAM-labeled primers, after which the PCR amplicon was incubated with GO and the fluorescence was measured. The results were compared with those obtained by conventional real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR). The fluorescence intensity observed increased in a concentration-dependent manner with the FAM-labeled IS6110 amplicon. The results of the PCR-GO system for detecting IS6110 DNA were in good agreement with those obtained with conventional RQ-PCR (kappa statistic = 0.925). The PCR-GO system detected MTB DNA in 23 of 25 RQ-PCR-positive sputum samples (92.0%; 95% CI, 75.0-98.0%), but not in 29 of 29 RQ-PCR-negative sputum samples (100%; 95% CI, 88.1-100.0%). These results indicate the utility of the PCR-GO system in molecular diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W1912280530,"Objective The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of hypertonic saline with 6% Dextran-70 (HSD) resuscitation on organ damage and the resuscitation efficiency of the combination of HSD and lactated ringers (LR) in a model of hemorrhage shock in dogs. Methods Beagles were bled to hold their mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 50±5 mmHg for 1 h. After hemorrhage, beagles were divided into three groups (n = 7) to receive pre-hospital resuscitation for 1 h (R1): HSD (4 ml/kg), LR (40 ml/kg), and HSD+LR (a combination of 4 ml/kg HSD and 40 ml/kg LR). Next, LR was transfused into all groups as in-hospital resuscitation (R2). After two hours of observation (R3), autologous blood was transfused. Hemodynamic responses and systemic oxygenation were measured at predetermined phases. Three days after resuscitation, the animals were sacrificed and tissues including kidney, lung, liver and intestinal were obtained for pathological analysis. Results Although the initial resuscitation with HSD was shown to be faster than LR with regard to an ascending MAP, the HSD group showed a similar hemodynamic performance compared to the LR group throughout the experiment. Compared with the LR group, the systemic oxygenation performance in the HSD group was similar but showed a lower venous-to-arterial CO2 gradient (Pv-aCO2) at R3 (p < 0.05). Additionally, the histology score of the kidneys, lungs and liver were significantly lower in the HSD group than in the LR group (p < 0.05). The HSD+LR group showed a superior hemodynamic response but higher extravascular lung water (EVLW) and lower arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) than the other groups (p < 0.05). The HSD+LR group showed a marginally improved systemic oxygenation performance and lower histology score than other groups. Conclusions Resuscitation after hemorrhagic shock with a bolus of HSD showed a similar hemodynamic response compared with LR at ten times the volume of HSD, but HSD showed superior efficacy in organ protection. Our findings suggest that resuscitation with the combination of HSD and LR in the pre-hospital setting is an effective treatment."

Yet broad applications of the volumetric ESAs are still hindered since the low cost fabrication has remained a tremendous challenge. Here we report a state-of-the-art technology to transfer electrically conductive composites (ECCs) from a planar mould to a volumetric thermoplastic substrate by using pad-printing technology without pattern distortion, benefit from the excellent properties of the ECCs as well as the printing-calibration method that we developed. The antenna samples prepared in this way meet the stringent requirement of an ESA (ka is as low as 0.32 and the antenna efficiency is as high as 57%), suggesting that volumetric electronic components i.e. the antennas can be produced in such a simple, green, and cost-effective way. This work can be of interest for the development of studies on green and high performance wireless communication devices."
https://openalex.org/W2133570310,"Distance sampling is a widely used method to estimate animal population size. Most distance sampling models utilize a monotonically decreasing detection function such as a half-normal. Recent advances in distance sampling modeling allow for the incorporation of covariates into the distance model, and the elimination of the assumption of perfect detection at some fixed distance (usually the transect line) with the use of double-observer models. The assumption of full observer independence in the double-observer model is problematic, but can be addressed by using the point independence assumption which assumes there is one distance, the apex of the detection function, where the 2 observers are assumed independent. Aerially collected distance sampling data can have a unimodal shape and have been successfully modeled with a gamma detection function. Covariates in gamma detection models cause the apex of detection to shift depending upon covariate levels, making this model incompatible with the point independence assumption when using double-observer data. This paper reports a unimodal detection model based on a two-piece normal distribution that allows covariates, has only one apex, and is consistent with the point independence assumption when double-observer data are utilized. An aerial line-transect survey of black bears in Alaska illustrate how this method can be applied."
https://openalex.org/W1676505105,"B cell hybridomas are an important source of monoclonal antibodies. In this paper, we developed a high-throughput method to characterize mouse IgG antibodies using surface plasmon resonance technology. This assay rapidly determines their sub-isotypes, whether they bind native antigen and their approximate affinities for the antigen using only 50 μl of hybridoma cell culture supernatant. Moreover, we found that mouse hybridomas secreting IgG antibodies also have membrane form IgG expression without Igα. Based on this surface IgG, we used flow cytometry to isolate rare γ2a isotype switched variants from a γ2b antibody secreting hybridoma cell line. Also, we used fluorescent antigen to single cell sort antigen binding hybridoma cells from bulk mixture of fused hybridoma cells instead of the traditional multi-microwell plate screening and limiting dilution sub-cloning thus saving time and labor. The IgG monoclonal antibodies specific for the native antigen identified with these methods are suitable for in vivo therapeutic uses, but also for sandwich ELISA assays, histology, flow cytometry, immune precipitation and x-ray crystallography."
https://openalex.org/W2156040118,"Inappropriate prescribing of antiosteoporotic medications has been observed; however, the joint study of both overuse and underuse has barely been attempted. Spain, with its high utilization rates, constitutes a good example to assess differences in over and under use according to diverse highly-influential osteoporosis guidelines (HIOG) worldwide. We used data of a population-based cross-sectional study including 824 post-menopausal women ≥50 years old living in the city of Valencia, Spain and aimed to estimate the percentage of women eligible for treatment, and the proportion of overuse and underuse of antiosteoporotic treatment according to HIOG. The prevalence of antiosteoporotic treatment in postmenopausal women ≥ 50 in Valencia was 20.9% (95%CI:17.6–24.4). The type of antiosteoporotic drugs prescribed varied greatly depending on the medical specialty responsible of the initial prescription. When applying the HIOG, the percentage of women 50 and over who should be treated varied from less than 9% to over 44%. In real terms, from the approximately eight million women of 50 years old and over in Spain, the number eligible for treatment would range from 0.7 to 3.8 million, depending on the guideline used. A huge proportion of inappropriate treatments was found when applying these guidelines to the Spanish population, combining a high overuse (42–78% depending on the guideline used) and underuse (7–41%). In conclusion, we found that the pharmacological management of osteoporosis in women of 50 and over in this population combines an important overuse and, to a lesser extent, underuse, although the level of inappropriateness varied strikingly depending on the CPG used. It seems urgent to reduce treatment overuse without neglecting underuse, as is urgent an attempt to reach wider agreement worldwide regarding osteoporosis management, in order to facilitate appropriate treatment and development of policies to reduce effectively treatment inappropriateness."
https://openalex.org/W1930600971,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa employs a type three secretion system to facilitate infections in mammalian hosts. The operons encoding genes of structural components of the secretion machinery and associated virulence factors are all under the control of the AraC-type transcriptional activator protein, ExsA. ExsA belongs to a unique subfamily of AraC-proteins that is regulated through protein-protein contacts rather than small molecule ligands. Prior to infection, ExsA is inhibited through a direct interaction with the anti-activator ExsD. To activate ExsA upon host cell contact this interaction is disrupted by the anti-antiactivator protein ExsC. Here we report the crystal structure of the regulatory domain of ExsA, which is known to mediate ExsA dimerization as well as ExsD binding. The crystal structure suggests two models for the ExsA dimer. Both models confirmed the previously shown involvement of helix α-3 in ExsA dimerization but one also suggest a role for helix α-2. These structural data are supported by the observation that a mutation in α-2 greatly diminished the ability of ExsA to activate transcription in vitro. Additional in vitro transcription studies revealed that a conserved pocket, used by AraC and the related ToxT protein for the binding of small molecule regulators, although present in ExsA is not involved in binding of ExsD."
https://openalex.org/W2144339314,"Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) present increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this study is to improve the assessment of lipoprotein profile in patients with T1D by using a robust developed method 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR), for further correlation with clinical factors associated to CVD. Thirty patients with T1D and 30 non-diabetes control (CT) subjects, matched for gender, age, body composition (DXA, BMI, waist/hip ratio), regular physical activity levels and cardiorespiratory capacity (VO2peak), were analyzed. Dietary records and routine lipids were assessed. Serum lipoprotein particle subfractions, particle sizes, and cholesterol and triglycerides subfractions were analyzed by 1H NMR. It was evidenced that subjects with T1D presented lower concentrations of small LDL cholesterol, medium VLDL particles, large VLDL triglycerides, and total triglycerides as compared to CT subjects. Women with T1D presented a positive association with HDL size (p<0.005; R = 0.601) and large HDL triglycerides (p<0.005; R = 0.534) and negative (p<0.005; R = -0.586) to small HDL triglycerides. Body fat composition represented an important factor independently of normal BMI, with large LDL particles presenting a positive correlation to total body fat (p<0.005; R = 0.505), and total LDL cholesterol and small LDL cholesterol a positive correlation (p<0.005; R = 0.502 and R = 0.552, respectively) to abdominal fat in T1D subjects; meanwhile, in CT subjects, body fat composition was mainly associated to HDL subclasses. VO2peak was negatively associated (p<0.005; R = -0.520) to large LDL-particles only in the group of patients with T1D. In conclusion, patients with T1D with adequate glycemic control and BMI and without chronic complications presented a more favourable lipoprotein profile as compared to control counterparts. In addition, slight alterations in BMI and/or body fat composition showed to be relevant to provoking alterations in lipoproteins profiles. Finally, body fat composition appears to be a determinant for cardioprotector lipoprotein profile."
https://openalex.org/W1256291830,"Direct exposure of cardiomyocytes to ethanol causes cardiac damage such as cardiac arrythmias and apoptotic cell death. Cardiomyocytes are connected to each other through intercalated disks (ID), which are composed of a gap junction (GJ), adherens junction, and desmosome. Changes in the content as well as the subcellular localization of connexin43 (Cx43), the main component of the cardiac GJ, are reportedly involved in cardiac arrythmias and subsequent damage. Recently, the hippo-YAP signaling pathway, which links cellular physical status to cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, has been implicated in cardiac homeostasis under physiological as well as pathological conditions. This study was conducted to explore the possible involvement of junctional intercellular communication, mechanotransduction through cytoskeletal organization, and the hippo-YAP pathway in cardiac damage caused by direct exposure to ethanol. HL-1 murine atrial cardiac cells were used since these cells retain cardiac phenotypes through ID formation and subsequent synchronous contraction. Cells were exposed to 0.5–2% ethanol; significant apoptotic cell death was observed after exposure to 2% ethanol for 48 hours. A decrease in Cx43 levels was already observed after 3 hours exposure to 2% ethanol, suggesting a rapid degradation of this protein. Upon exposure to ethanol, Cx43 translocated into lysosomes. Cellular cytoskeletal organization was also dysregulated by ethanol, as demonstrated by the disruption of myofibrils and intermediate filaments. Coinciding with the loss of cell-cell adherence, decreased phosphorylation of YAP, a hippo pathway effector, was also observed in ethanol-treated cells. Taken together, the results provide evidence that cells exposed directly to ethanol show 1) impaired cell-cell adherence/communication, 2) decreased cellular mechanotransduction by the cytoskeleton, and 3) a suppressed hippo-YAP pathway. Suppression of hippo-YAP pathway signaling should be effective in maintaining cellular homeostasis in cardiomyocytes exposed to ethanol."
https://openalex.org/W2137466197,"Long-term central venous catheters are essential for the management of chronic medical conditions, including childhood cancer. Catheter occlusion is associated with an increased risk of subsequent complications, including bloodstream infection, venous thrombosis, and catheter fracture. Therefore, predicting and pre-emptively treating occlusions should prevent complications, but no method for predicting such occlusions has been developed.We conducted a prospective trial to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of catheter-resistance monitoring, a novel approach to predicting central venous catheter occlusion in pediatric patients. Participants who had tunneled catheters and were receiving treatment for cancer or undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation underwent weekly catheter-resistance monitoring for up to 12 weeks. Resistance was assessed by measuring the inline pressure at multiple flow-rates via a syringe pump system fitted with a pressure-sensing transducer. When turbulent flow through the device was evident, resistance was not estimated, and the result was noted as ""non-laminar.""Ten patients attended 113 catheter-resistance monitoring visits. Elevated catheter resistance (>8.8% increase) was strongly associated with the subsequent development of acute catheter occlusion within 10 days (odds ratio = 6.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-21.5; p <0.01; sensitivity, 75%; specificity, 67%). A combined prediction model comprising either change in resistance greater than 8.8% or a non-laminar result predicted subsequent occlusion (odds ratio = 6.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.0-22.8; p = 0.002; sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 63%). Participants rated catheter-resistance monitoring as highly acceptable.In this pediatric hematology and oncology population, catheter-resistance monitoring is feasible, acceptable, and predicts imminent catheter occlusion. Larger studies are required to validate these findings, assess the predictive value for other clinical outcomes, and determine the impact of pre-emptive therapy.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01737554."
https://openalex.org/W1130374160,"At synapses, the release of neurotransmitter is regulated by molecular machinery that aggregates at specialized presynaptic release sites termed active zones. The complement of active zone proteins at each site is a determinant of release efficacy and can be remodeled to alter synapse function. The small GTPase Rab3 was previously identified as playing a novel role that controls the distribution of active zone proteins to individual release sites at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. Rab3 has been extensively studied for its role in the synaptic vesicle cycle; however, the mechanism by which Rab3 controls active zone development remains unknown. To explore this mechanism, we conducted a mutational analysis to determine the molecular and structural requirements of Rab3 function at Drosophila synapses. We find that GTP-binding is required for Rab3 to traffick to synapses and distribute active zone components across release sites. Conversely, the hydrolytic activity of Rab3 is unnecessary for this function. Through a structure-function analysis we identify specific residues within the effector-binding switch regions that are required for Rab3 function and determine that membrane attachment is essential. Our findings suggest that Rab3 controls the distribution of active zone components via a vesicle docking mechanism that is consistent with standard Rab protein function."
https://openalex.org/W1845469332,"TCR-dependent and costimulation signaling, cell division, and cytokine environment are major factors driving cytokines expression induced by CD4(+) T cell activation. PEA-15 15 (Protein Enriched in Astrocyte / 15 kDa) is an adaptor protein that regulates death receptor-induced apoptosis and proliferation signaling by binding to FADD and relocating ERK1/2 to the cytosol, respectively. By using PEA-15-deficient mice, we examined the role of PEA-15 in TCR-dependent cytokine production in CD4(+) T cells. TCR-stimulated PEA-15-deficient CD4(+) T cells exhibited defective progression through the cell cycle associated with impaired expression of cyclin E and phosphoRb, two ERK1/2-dependent proteins of the cell cycle. Accordingly, expression of the division cycle-dependent cytokines IL-2 and IFNγ, a Th1 cytokine, was reduced in stimulated PEA-15-deficient CD4(+) T cells. This was associated with abnormal subcellular compartmentalization of activated ERK1/2 in PEA-15-deficient T cells. Furthermore, in vitro TCR-dependent differentiation of naive CD4(+) CD62L(+) PEA-15-deficient T cells was associated with a lower production of the Th2 cytokine, IL-4, whereas expression of the Th17-associated molecule IL4I1 was enhanced. Finally, a defective humoral response was shown in PEA-15-deficient mice in a model of red blood cell alloimmunization performed with Poly IC, a classical adjuvant of Th1 response in vivo. Collectively, our data suggest that PEA-15 contributes to the specification of the cytokine pattern of activated Th cells, thus highlighting a potential new target to interfere with T cell functional polarization and subsequent immune response."
https://openalex.org/W1924306623,"The aim of this study was to describe the frequency and distribution of Saffold virus in longitudinal stool samples from children, and test for association with development of persistent autoantibodies predictive of type 1 diabetes. A cohort of Norwegian children carrying the HLA genotype associated with highest risk of type 1 diabetes (“DR4-DQ8/DR3-DQ2”) was followed with monthly stool samples from 3 to 35 months of age. Blood samples were tested for autoantibodies to insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase65 and Islet Antigen-2. 2077 stool samples from 27 children with ≥2 repeatedly positive islet autoantibodies (cases), and 53 matched controls were analysed for Saffold virus genomic RNA by semi-quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. Saffold virus was found in 53 of 2077 (2.6%) samples, with similar proportions between cases (2.5%) and controls (2.6%). The probability of being infected by 3 years of age was 28% (95% CI 0.18–0.40). Viral quantities ranged from <1 to almost 105 copies/μl. Estimated odds ratio between islet autoimmunity and infection episodes prior to seroconversion was 1.98 (95% CI: 0.57–6.91, p = 0.29). Saffold virus had no statistically significant association with islet autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W2155537421,"The uses of the Genome Reference Consortium’s human reference sequence can be roughly categorized into three related but distinct categories: as a representative species genome, as a coordinate system for identifying variants, and as an alignment reference for variation detection algorithms. However, the use of this reference sequence as simultaneously a representative species genome and as an alignment reference leads to unnecessary artifacts for structural variation detection algorithms and limits their accuracy. We show how decoupling these two references and developing a separate alignment reference can significantly improve the accuracy of structural variation detection, lead to improved genotyping of disease related genes, and decrease the cost of studying polymorphism in a population."
https://openalex.org/W1936119280,"Parliamentary motions are a vital and frequently used element of political control in democratic regimes. Despite their high incidence and potential impact on the political fate of a government and its policies, we know relatively little about the conditions under which parliamentary motions are likely to be accepted or rejected. Current collective decision-making models use a voting power framework in which power and influence of the involved parties are the main predictors. We propose an alternative, social dilemma approach, according to which a motion's likelihood to be accepted depends on the severity of the social dilemma underlying the decision issue. Actor- and dilemma-centered hypotheses are developed and tested with data from a stratified random sample of 822 motions that have been voted upon in the Dutch Parliament between September 2009 and February 2011. The social dilemma structure of each motion is extracted through content coding, applying a cognitive mapping technique developed by Anthony, Heckathorn and Maser. Logistic regression analyses are in line with both, actor-centered and social-dilemma centered approaches, though the latter show stronger effect sizes. Motions have a lower chance to be accepted if voting potential is low, the proposer is not from the voting party, and if the problem underlying the motion reflects a prisoner's dilemma or a pure competition game as compared to a coordination game. The number of proposing parties or a battle of the sexes structure does not significantly affect the outcome."
https://openalex.org/W1921658733,"In the present study, patch-clamp techniques have been used to investigate the effect of trimethyltin chloride (Met3SnCl) on the slow vacuolar (SV) channels in vacuoles from red beet (Beta vulgaris L.) taproots. Activity of SV channels has been measured in whole-vacuole and cytosolic side-out patch configurations. It was found that addition of trimethyltin chloride to the bath solution suppressed, in a concentration-dependent manner, SV currents in red beet vacuoles. The time constant, τ, increased significantly in the presence of the organotin. When single channel activity was analyzed, only little channel activity could be recorded at 100 μM Met3SnCl. Trimethyltin chloride added to the bath medium significantly decreased (by ca. threefold at 100 μM Met3SnCl and at 100 mV voltage, as compared to the control medium) the open probability of single channels. Single channel recordings obtained in the presence and absence of trimethyltin chloride showed that the organotin only slightly (by <10%) decreased the unitary conductance of single channels. It was also found that Met3SnCl significantly diminished the number of SV channel openings, whereas it did not change the opening times of the channels. Taking into account the above and the fact that under the here applied experimental conditions (pH = 7.5) Met3SnCl is a non-dissociated (more lipophilic) compound, we suggest that the suppression of SV currents observed in the presence of the organotin results probably from its hydrophobic properties allowing this compound to translocate near the selectivity filter of the channel."
https://openalex.org/W1954013540,"The defensive withdrawal reflexes of Aplysia are important behaviors for protecting the animal from predation. Habituation and dishabituation allow for experience-dependent tuning of these reflexes and the mechanisms underlying these forms of behavioral plasticity involve changes in transmitter release from the sensory to motor neuron synapses through homosynaptic depression and the serotonin-mediated recovery from depression, respectively. Interestingly, dishabituation is reduced in older animals with no corresponding change in habituation. Here we show that the cultured sensory neurons of heavier animals (greater than 120 g) that form synaptic connections with motor neurons have both reduced recovery from depression and reduced novel PKC Apl II activation with 5HT. The decrease in the recovery from depression correlated better with the size of the animal than the age of the animal. Much of this change in PKC activation and synaptic facilitation following depression can be rescued by direct activation of PKC Apl II with phorbol dibutyrate, suggesting a change in the signal transduction pathway upstream of PKC Apl II activation in the sensory neurons of larger animals."
https://openalex.org/W1900027555,"Functional Magnetic Resonance (fMRI) data can be used to depict functional connectivity of the brain. Standard techniques have been developed to construct brain networks from this data; typically nodes are considered as voxels or sets of voxels with weighted edges between them representing measures of correlation. Identifying cognitive states based on fMRI data is connected with recording voxel activity over a certain time interval. Using this information, network and machine learning techniques can be applied to discriminate the cognitive states of the subjects by exploring different features of data. In this work we wish to describe and understand the organization of brain connectivity networks under cognitive tasks. In particular, we use a regularity partitioning algorithm that finds clusters of vertices such that they all behave with each other almost like random bipartite graphs. Based on the random approximation of the graph, we calculate a lower bound on the number of triangles as well as the expectation of the distribution of the edges in each subject and state. We investigate the results by comparing them to the state of the art algorithms for exploring connectivity and we argue that during epochs that the subject is exposed to stimulus, the inspected part of the brain is organized in an efficient way that enables enhanced functionality."
