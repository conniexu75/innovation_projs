https://openalex.org/W2094396823,"Human monocytes contain two distinct receptor sites, one specific for the third component of complement (C'3), the other for immunoglobulin G(gammaG). The two receptors may function either independently or cooperatively in the induction of phagocytosis. Ingestion of erythrocytes coated with immunoglobulin M antibody requires a relatively large number of bound C'3 molecules per cell. Ingestion of erythrocytes sensitized with gammaG antibody is independent of complement; however, the reaction is inhibited by concentrations of gammaG far below those in normal serum. Inhibition by gammaG-globulin is overcome by a relatively small number of bound C'3 molecules per cell. The two monocyte receptors exert a cooperative effect on ingestion by monocytes of erythrocytes coated with gammaG antibody in the presence of inhibitory amounts of free gammaG."

This protein is devoid of light chains and is closely related to the alpha polypeptide chains of the gamma(A1) (Le) subclass of immunoglobulin A. It is characterized by electrophoretic heterogeneity, tendency toward polymerization, and a high carbohydrate content. No intracellular synthesis of light chain was detected."

This lysis of C'3 is 80 to 90 percent complete in 20 minutes at 37 degrees C and pH 7. Neither the nephritic factor nor its cofactor is identifiable with the complement system.

https://openalex.org/W1534571937,"A benzidine-H2O2 staining procedure and genetic tests were used for the detection of cytochrome c-deficient mutants of the cy1, cy2, cy3, cy4, and cy6 loci. The chromosomal gene, CY1, was shown to encode the primary structure of iso-1-cytochrome c from bakers' yeast. Sixteen cy1 mutants were isolated after examining over 1 million colonies. These cy1 mutants could be categorized as follows: (a) those which were completely deficient in iso-1-cytochrome c and failed to grow on lactate medium; (b) those which were partially deficient in iso-1-cytochrome c but failed to grow on lactate medium; and (c) those which were partially deficient in iso-1-cytochrome c and grew slightly on lactate medium. Both the concentrations of cytochrome c and the extent of growth on lactate medium of some, but not all, of the cy1 mutants were increased after incubation at lower temperatures. Up to three intragenic revertants were isolated from each of 15 cy1 mutants and iso-1-cytochromes c were prepared. Peptide mapping and amino acid analysis of 34 samples revealed that all of the revertants from eight of the cy1 mutants apparently contained normal iso-1-cytochrome c, while a revertant which contained an altered protein was obtained from each of the other seven cy1 mutants. The alterations in revertants from six of these latter cy1 mutants appear to be single amino acid substitutions which are located at six different residue positions. The alteration in a revertant of the seventh cy1 strain is more complex, since 2 residues are added in such a manner as to alter only one of the normal peptides. The amino acid replacements are discussed in terms of nonsense and missense mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2148438188,"Two siblings with Refsum's disease, an inherited disorder of lipid metabolism, oxidized intravenously injected uniformly labeled phytanic acid-C14 at rates less than 5 percent of those found in normal subjects. The defect in oxidation of phytanic acid persisted in cultures of fibroblasts from the patients' skin. The rate of oxidation of the phytanic acid-C14 was less than 1 percent of that found in cultures of fibroblasts from normal skin. However, pristanic acid, previously shown to be the first product of phytanic acid degradation, was oxidized at a normal rate in the patients' cultures. These results indicate that the enzymatic defect in Refsum's disease is in the first step of the pathway for degradation of phytanic acid, that is, in the unusual alpha-oxidative process that leads to a shortening of phytanic acid by one carbon atom."

https://openalex.org/W2193358949,"Abstract Further studies on the functional properties of a Waldenstrom macroglobulin (γMlay) with antibody activity have been performed. Binding of the subunits, γMs, and tryptic fragments, Fabµ, to the antigen, human γG, has been examined by ultracentrifugation and equilibrium molecular sieving. While the data have certain inevitable ambiguities, they are consistent with: (a) the antibody reacting with a single determinant on γG, (b) the subunits being potentially divalent although functionally univalent, and (c) all of the Fabµ fragments being functionally equivalent. Since the primary antigen-combining site interaction is energetically similar to that found in other systems, it is concluded that the cryoprecipitating property of the γM-γG complex is due to the univalence of the antigen as well as the solubility characteristics of the aggregates."

https://openalex.org/W2034245610,Fluorescein-labeled immunoglobulin G fractions from serums of patients with acute glomerulonephritis and from many normal serums stained the glomerular basement membrane and mesangium of renal tissue from patients with early acute glomerulonephritis; these serums did not stain the corresponding tissues from patients with any other kidney disease. Previous absorption of the serum fraction with frozen and thawed nephritogenic beta hemolytic streptococci abolished all staining. Other bacteria studied did not abolish the staining. Only the plasma membrane of the streptococcus absorbed the immunoglobulin G fraction; such absorption eliminated staining. Fluorescein-labeled antiserums against streptococcal plasma membrane had staining properties similar to patients' serums.

https://openalex.org/W1558785936,"Direct optical scanning of gel columns provides a useful new approach to analytical molecular sieve chromatography. Configurations of solute zones can be observed in detail during column experiments, and molecular parameters of a solute system can thus be analyzed at many intervals during a single experiment of short duration. A scanning system has been built in which the column is driven through a horizontally collimated beam of monochromatic light and absorbance values are recorded as a function of distance along the column. Accurate measurements can be made at wave lengths as low as 220 mµ. Three new procedures for quantitative characterization of single component systems of macromolecules by direct scanning of gel columns are presented. Partition coefficients are obtained from either moving zones or saturated column experiments. In moving zone experiments peak positions of a small zone or centroid positions of large zone boundaries are measured along with corresponding values of volume flow. In the static experiment, solute partitioning at any level within a saturated column is directly related to the optical density measured at that level. The three independent methods are shown to yield equivalent results. Preliminary results indicate that the technique of scanning gel chromatography is well suited for studies of interacting systems of macromolecules."
https://openalex.org/W1579221095,"Abstract Human pregnancy serum was previously reported to exhibit a high binding affinity for testosterone; steroid binding was measured by a semimicrotechnique, based on the principle of equilibrium dialysis but utilizing Sephadex G-25 in a batchwise fashion. This property may be ascribed to a testosterone-binding component, presumably a protein, present in very low concentration in serum. The testosterone-binding component was readily separated from corticosteroid-binding globulin (both steroid-binding proteins are present at elevated levels in late pregnancy) by column chromatography of pooled pregnancy serum on microgranular diethylaminoethyl cellulose. Stepwise elution furnished four major fractions: γ-globulin, β-globulin, albumin, and α-globulin, in that sequence. The testosterone-binding component appeared in the β-globulin fraction, whereas the corticosteroid-binding globulin (measured by its cortisol- and progesterone-binding activities) appeared in the albumin fraction; the latter fraction also exhibited considerable testosterone-binding activity, attributable to albumin itself and, in part, to corticosteroid-binding globulin. A portion of the β-globulin fraction (after precipitation in 50% ammonium sulfate) was chromatographed on a column of Sephadex G-100; the testosterone-binding protein was thereby separated from the bulk of the protein (the former emerged last from the column). Considerable losses in testosterone-binding activity were, however, encountered at each stage of purification, and so the over-all increase in specific binding activity (i.e. testosterone-binding activity per g of total protein) was only about 4-fold. Other fractionation procedures, i.e. column chromatography on hydroxylapatite and on fibrous DEAE-cellulose, were not as efficacious, but nonetheless informative; the testosterone-binding component is readily precipitated from whole serum in 50% saturated ammonium sulfate. The testosterone-binding component is distinctly different from corticosteroid-binding globulin in its chromatographic behavior and steroid-binding properties. There is also an appreciable difference in molecular size according to gel filtration studies: the testosterone-binding component has a Stokes molecular radius of about 47 A compared to 36 A for corticosteroid-binding globulin; the same value was obtained for the latter protein from the sedimentation and diffusion data of other investigators."

https://openalex.org/W1552874824,"Abstract Precipitation at pH 5.6 is found to improve the rabbit muscle troponin preparation. Further purification of troponin is achieved by treating troponin preparations with 0.1 m dithiothreitol, followed by the removal of contaminating tropomyosin by gel filtration. This is possible because through these purification procedures the molecular weight of tropomyosin as estimated by gel filtration remains fairly constant (approximately 130,000), while that of troponin preparations is gradually reduced from approximately 150,000 via 90,000 to 44,000. The sulfhydryl and tryptophan contents of troponin thus purified are 5.4 and 4.0 moles/105 g protein, respectively. Evidence is presented which indicates that tropomyosin and troponin form a complex which behaves exactly like the relaxing protein, and that the relaxing protein preparation is actually dissociated by 5 m urea into troponin and tropomyosin. The weight ratio of troponin to tropomyosin in the relaxing protein as estimated from the density of Amido black staining on gel electrophoresis is approximately 1:2.5. Precipitation of troponin by calcium and disaggregation of troponin by dithiothreitol support the view that, subsequent to calcium binding, troponin undergoes conformational change which is in turn transmitted through tropomyosin to the actin-myosin interaction."

The light chains were separated from the heavy chains and subjected to peptic digestion. Two radioactive peptides were recovered from the digest.

By contrast, weanling NZB and B/ W F(1) mice (18 to 25 days) as well as weanling C3H mice (16 to 19 days) became tolerant and had no serum antibody 12 days after challenge. The C3H mice remained unresponsive, but NZB and B! W F(1) mice produced antibody between days 27 and 41. The rapid loss of previously established tolerance to foreign antigens could have its parallel in the loss of tolerance to autoantigens with subsequent development of lupus nephritis and Coombs' positive hemolytic anemia in these animals."

https://openalex.org/W1675529715,"Abstract The isolation of immunochemically pure samples of γA myeloma proteins from human and canine sera and of equine γT-globulin antibodies and a γT paraprotein is described. Antigenic and ultracentrifugal analyses of the isolated proteins also are presented. The optical rotatory dispersion curves of the γA- and γT-globulins show minima near 230 and 225 mµ and maxima near 206 mµ. The Cotton effect at 240 mµ characteristic of human and equine γG-globulins could not be detected in either intact γA- or γT-globulins. A rare human γA2 subclass myeloma protein is not distinguishable from γA1-globulins by rotatory dispersion despite considerable differences in structure. Conversion of the dimeric canine γA-globulin to the monomer on mild reduction is not accompanied by any detectable change in conformation. The optical rotatory dispersion curves of F(ab')2 fragments produced by peptic digestion of human γA- and equine γT-globulins show single minima near 225 mµ. The F(ab')2 fragment of γA-globulin shows a Cotton effect at 240 mµ, whereas that of γT-globulin does not. In both fragments the levorotation above 235 mµ is considerably lower than in the parent protein. The results indicate that conformational differences exist between both human γA- and equine γT-globulins and their respective γG-globulins. While the rotatory dispersion spectra of the γA- and γT-globulins show over-all similarities, comparison of their respective peptic fragments suggests that there is some difference in conformation."

This immunoglobulin was degraded with pepsin to obtain an F(ab')(2) fragment. Fresh tumor cells were incubated with immunoglobulin or the fragment and injected into normal guinea pigs. The growth of these cells as tumor xenografts was inhibited by the gamma(2)-immunoglobulin and enhanced by the F(ab')(2) fragment.

https://openalex.org/W1554466351,"Microsomes derived from guinea pigs immunized with dinitrophenyl-protein conjugates possess firmly associated antibodies specific for the dinitrophenyl determinant. The fact that these antibodies can be specifically displaced by incubation with an excess of soluble, normal γ-globulins provides a method for studying the site (sites) on γ-globulin involved in the microsome-antibody complex. After digestion of γ-globulin or of the Fc fragment, several peptide fractions were separated by molecular sieve chromatography. All of these were found to be capable of solubilizing antibody from the microsomes. The peptides in one of the active fractions appear to be quite small as judged by their absorption into the matrix of Sephadex G-25 and G-15. The effect of mild periodate oxidation of γ-globulin on its ability to dissociate antibody from the microsomes was also examined. After oxidation, the ability of γ-globulin to displace antibody was increased 5-fold. In contrast, the reduction of a single disulfide bond located at the center of the heavy chains of γ-globulin resulted in a 5-fold decrease in the capacity of such γ-globulin to dissociate antibody. Direct reduction of the microsome-antibody complex also resulted in a loss of microsomal antibody. These findings and the fact that the reactive disulfide is adjacent to a threonine residue bearing one of the carbohydrate chains of γ-globulin are discussed in relation to the nature of the antibody-binding site on microsomes."
