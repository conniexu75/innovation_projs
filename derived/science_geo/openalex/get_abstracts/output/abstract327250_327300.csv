https://openalex.org/W1974097455,"A continuous record of oxygen-18 (delta(18)O) variations in the continental hydrosphere during the middle-to-late Pleistocene has been obtained from a uranium-series dated calcitic vein in the southern Great Basin. The vein was deposited from ground water that moved through Devils Hole-an open fault zone at Ash Meadows, Nevada-between 50 and 310 ka (thousand years ago). The configuration of the delta(18)O versus time curve closely resembles the marine and Antarctic ice core (Vostok) delta(18)O curves; however, the U-Th dates indicate that the last interglacial stage (marine oxygen isotope stage 5) began before 147 +/- 3 ka, at least 17,000 years earlier than indicated by the marine delta(18)O record and 7,000 years earlier than indicated by the less well dated Antarctic delta(18)O record. This discrepancy and other differences in the timing of key climatic events suggest that the indirectly dated marine delta(18)O chronology may need revision and that orbital forcing may not be the principal cause of the Pleistocene ice ages."

https://openalex.org/W1991791979,"Infrared observations of Io during the 1986 apparition of Jupiter indicate that a large eruptive event occurred on the leading side of Io on 7 August 1986, Universal Time. Measurements made at 4.8, 8.7, and 20 micrometers suggest that the source of the event was about 15 kilometers in radius with a model temperature of approximately 900 Kelvin. Together with previously reported events, these measurements indicate that high-temperature volcanic activity on the leading side of Io may be more frequent than previously thought. The inferred temperature is significantly above the boiling point of sulfur in a vacuum(715 Kelvin) and thus constitutes strong evidence for active silicate volcanism on the surface of Io."

https://openalex.org/W2092680833,"A measurement and interpretation on a molecular level of a phase transition in an ordered Langmuir monolayer is reported. The diagram of surface pressure (pi) versus molecular area of a monolayer of chiral (S)-[CF(3)-(CF(2))(9)-(CH(2))(2)-OCO-CH(2)-CH (NH(3)(+))CO(2)(-)] over water shows a change in slope at about pi(s)= 25 millinewtons per meter. Grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction and specular reflectivity measurements indicate a solid-solid phase transition at pi(s). The diffraction pattren at low pressures reveals two diffraction peaks of equal intensities, with lattice spacings d of 5.11 and 5.00 angstroms; these coalesce for pi >/=pi(s). Structural models that fit the diffraction data show that at pi> pi(s) the molecules pack in a two-dimensional crystal with the molecules aligned vertically. At pi < pi(s) there is a molecular tilt of 16 degrees +/- 7 degrees . Independent x-ray reflectivity data yield a tilt of 26 degrees +/- 7 degrees . Concomitant with the tilt, the diffraction data indicate a transition from a hexagonal to a distorted-hexagonal lattice. The hexagonal arrangement is favored because the -(CF(2))(9)CF(3) moiety adopts a helical conformation. Compression to 70 millinewtons per meter yields a unit cell with increased crystallinity and a coherence length exceeding 1000 angstroms."

https://openalex.org/W2043342411,"History shows that progress in astronomy often stems directly from technological innovation and that each portion of the electromagnetic spectrum offers unique insights into the nature of the universe. Most recently, the widespread availability of infrared-sensitive two-dimensional array detectors has led to dramatic improvements in the capabilities of conventional ground-based observatories. The impact of this new technology on our understanding of a wide variety of phenomena is illustrated here by infrared pictures of star-forming regions, of nebulae produced by the late stages of stellar evolution, of the nucleus of our own galaxy(the Milky Way), and of activity in other galaxies."
https://openalex.org/W2007923839,By means of direct arterial perfusion of the adrenal glands in the dog it has been shown that synthetic lysine vasopressin stimulates the secretion of hydrocortisone. This effect is not mediated via the adenohypophysis or any other organ but is rather the result of direct stimulation of the adrenal cortex by vasopressin itself.
https://openalex.org/W4252715199,"An electronic model is described for simulating many of the gross operational functions which are believed to hold for living nerve cells. Synaptic growth is not included. Despite difficulties in drawing very rigorous analogies between the biological cell and its model, a sufficient number of rough similarities exist to make systemic experimentation interesting. Several approaches are mentioned."

https://openalex.org/W2023145205,"Orbital debris in the near-Earth environment has reached a number density sufficient for a significant collisional interaction with some of the long-lived high-energy protons in the radiation belt. As a result of a continuing buildup of a shell of man-made debris, the lifetimes of high-energy protons whose trajectories remain below 1500 kilometers will decrease to the point where in the next decades we can expect a noticeable reduction in their fluxes."

It is concluded that the interaction of a complex of chemical and physical factors produces both seasonal fluctuations and sporadic blooms of phytoplankton.
