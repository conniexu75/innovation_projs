https://openalex.org/W4281716291,"A central goal of genetics is to define the relationships between genotypes and phenotypes. High-content phenotypic screens such as Perturb-seq (CRISPR-based screens with single-cell RNA-sequencing readouts) enable massively parallel functional genomic mapping but, to date, have been used at limited scales. Here, we perform genome-scale Perturb-seq targeting all expressed genes with CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) across >2.5 million human cells. We use transcriptional phenotypes to predict the function of poorly characterized genes, uncovering new regulators of ribosome biogenesis (including CCDC86, ZNF236, and SPATA5L1), transcription (C7orf26), and mitochondrial respiration (TMEM242). In addition to assigning gene function, single-cell transcriptional phenotypes allow for in-depth dissection of complex cellular phenomena—from RNA processing to differentiation. We leverage this ability to systematically identify genetic drivers and consequences of aneuploidy and to discover an unanticipated layer of stress-specific regulation of the mitochondrial genome. Our information-rich genotype-phenotype map reveals a multidimensional portrait of gene and cellular function."
https://openalex.org/W4281832698,"Alpha-synuclein (αS) is a conformationally plastic protein that reversibly binds to cellular membranes. It aggregates and is genetically linked to Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here, we show that αS directly modulates processing bodies (P-bodies), membraneless organelles that function in mRNA turnover and storage. The N terminus of αS, but not other synucleins, dictates mutually exclusive binding either to cellular membranes or to P-bodies in the cytosol. αS associates with multiple decapping proteins in close proximity on the Edc4 scaffold. As αS pathologically accumulates, aberrant interaction with Edc4 occurs at the expense of physiologic decapping-module interactions. mRNA decay kinetics within PD-relevant pathways are correspondingly disrupted in PD patient neurons and brain. Genetic modulation of P-body components alters αS toxicity, and human genetic analysis lends support to the disease-relevance of these interactions. Beyond revealing an unexpected aspect of αS function and pathology, our data highlight the versatility of conformationally plastic proteins with high intrinsic disorder."
https://openalex.org/W4281780364,"Introduction There have been more than 425 million COVID-19 infections worldwide. Post-COVID illness has become a common, disabling complication of this infection. Therefore, it presents a significant challenge to global public health and economic activity. Methods Comprehensive clinical assessment (symptoms, WHO performance status, cognitive testing, CPET, lung function, high-resolution CT chest, CT pulmonary angiogram and cardiac MRI) of previously well, working-age adults in full-time employment was conducted to identify physical and neurocognitive deficits in those with severe or prolonged COVID-19 illness. Results 205 consecutive patients, age 39 (IQR30.0–46.7) years, 84% male, were assessed 24 (IQR17.1–34.0) weeks after acute illness. 69% reported ≥3 ongoing symptoms. Shortness of breath (61%), fatigue (54%) and cognitive problems (47%) were the most frequent symptoms, 17% met criteria for anxiety and 24% depression. 67% remained below pre-COVID performance status at 24 weeks. One third of lung function tests were abnormal, (reduced lung volume and transfer factor, and obstructive spirometry). HRCT lung was clinically indicated in &lt;50% of patients, with COVID-associated pathology found in 25% of these. In all but three HRCTs, changes were graded ‘mild’. There was an extremely low incidence of pulmonary thromboembolic disease or significant cardiac pathology. A specific, focal cognitive deficit was identified in those with ongoing symptoms of fatigue, poor concentration, poor memory, low mood, and anxiety. This was notably more common in patients managed in the community during their acute illness. Conclusion Despite low rates of residual cardiopulmonary pathology, in this cohort, with low rates of premorbid illness, there is a high burden of symptoms and failure to regain pre-COVID performance 6-months after acute illness. Cognitive assessment identified a specific deficit of the same magnitude as intoxication at the UK drink driving limit or the deterioration expected with 10 years ageing, which appears to contribute significantly to the symptomatology of long-COVID."
https://openalex.org/W4281780864,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor-neuron disease caused by mutations of the SMN1 gene. The human paralog SMN2, whose exon 7 (E7) is predominantly skipped, cannot compensate for the lack of SMN1. Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that upregulates E7 inclusion and SMN protein levels by displacing the splicing repressors hnRNPA1/A2 from their target site in intron 7. We show that by promoting transcriptional elongation, the histone deacetylase inhibitor VPA cooperates with a nusinersen-like ASO to promote E7 inclusion. Surprisingly, the ASO promotes the deployment of the silencing histone mark H3K9me2 on the SMN2 gene, creating a roadblock to RNA polymerase II elongation that inhibits E7 inclusion. By removing the roadblock, VPA counteracts the chromatin effects of the ASO, resulting in higher E7 inclusion without large pleiotropic effects. Combined administration of the nusinersen-like ASO and VPA in SMA mice strongly synergizes SMN expression, growth, survival, and neuromuscular function."
https://openalex.org/W4281843318,"The ability of the food industry to practice a high degree of corporate social responsibility is related to whether national food safety can be effectively guaranteed. By taking the food enterprises in China’s A-share listed companies from 2009–2018, this paper probes into the influence of China’s macroeconomic policy uncertainty on corporate social responsibility, and depicts the differencent impact of enterprise’s practice of social responsibility under government association and market association, respectively. The results firstly show that, the uncertainty of economic policy has a negative effect on the social responsibility of food enterprises, with a regression coefficient of -0.013. Secondly, nonstate-owned enterprises are more vulnerable to macroeconomic fluctuations in the practice of social responsibility. Thirdly, in the case of greater economic policy uncertainty, enterprises with stronger market connections in the food industry tend to be more conservative in their CSR. The above research results not only verify the path of transmission of economic policy uncertainty to corporate social responsibility, but also provide important ideas and references for improving the level of corporate social responsibility in the food industry and ensuring food safety."

https://openalex.org/W4281887537,"Given the long-term ineffectiveness of current therapies and late-stage diagnoses, lung cancer is a leading cause of malignant diseases. Tumor progression is influenced by cancer cell interactions with the tumor microenvironment (TME). Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) was reported to affect the TME; however, the role of IGF1R in lung TME has not been investigated. First, we assessed IGF1R genomic alterations and expression in NSCLC patient tissue samples, as well as IGF1R serum levels. Next, we performed tumor heterotopic transplantation and pulmonary metastases in IGF1R-deficient mice using melanoma and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells. Herein we report increased amplification and mRNA expression, as well as increased protein expression (IGF1R/p-IGF1R) and IGF1R levels in tumor samples and serum from NSCLC patients, respectively. Moreover, IGF1R deficiency in mice reduced tumor growth, proliferation, inflammation and vascularization, and increased apoptosis after tumor heterotopic transplantation. Following induction of lung metastasis, IGF1R-deficient lungs also demonstrated a reduced tumor burden, and decreased expression of tumor progression markers, p-IGF1R and p-ERK1/2. Additionally, IGF1R-deficient lungs showed increased apoptosis and diminished proliferation, vascularization, EMT and fibrosis, along with attenuated inflammation and immunosuppression. Accordingly, IGF1R deficiency decreased expression of p-IGF1R in blood vessels, fibroblasts, tumor-associated macrophages and FOXP3+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Our results demonstrate that IGF1R promotes metastatic tumor initiation and progression in lung TME. Furthermore, our research indicates that IGF1R could be a potential biomarker for early prediction of drug response and clinical evolution in NSCLC patients."
https://openalex.org/W4281700201,"Processing of sensory information depends on the interactions between hierarchically connected neocortical regions, but it remains unclear how the activity in one area causally influences the activity dynamics in another and how rapidly such interactions change with time. Here, we show that the communication between the primary visual cortex (V1) and high-order visual area LM is context-dependent and surprisingly dynamic over time. By momentarily silencing one area while recording activity in the other, we find that both areas reliably affected changing subpopulations of target neurons within one hundred milliseconds while mice observed a visual stimulus. The influence of LM feedback on V1 responses became even more dynamic when the visual stimuli predicted a reward, causing fast changes in the geometry of V1 population activity and affecting stimulus coding in a context-dependent manner. Therefore, the functional interactions between cortical areas are not static but unfold through rapidly shifting communication subspaces whose dynamics depend on context when processing sensory information."
https://openalex.org/W4281984930,"RNA quality control relies on co-factors and adaptors to identify and prepare substrates for degradation by ribonucleases such as the 3' to 5' ribonucleolytic RNA exosome. Here, we determined cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complexes bound to RNA that reveal mechanistic insights to substrate recognition and early steps that precede RNA handover to the exosome. The structures illuminate ZCCHC8 as a scaffold, mediating homodimerization while embracing the MTR4 helicase and flexibly anchoring RBM7 to the helicase core. All three subunits collaborate to bind the RNA, with RBM7 and ZCCHC8 surveying sequences upstream of the 3' end to facilitate RNA capture by MTR4. ZCCHC8 obscures MTR4 surfaces important for RNA binding and extrusion as well as MPP6-dependent recruitment and docking onto the RNA exosome core, interactions that contribute to RNA surveillance by coordinating RNA capture, translocation, and extrusion from the helicase to the exosome for decay."
https://openalex.org/W4281756494,"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive malignancy with neuroendocrine (NE) features, limited treatment options, and a lack of druggable targets. There is no reported involvement of the MUC1-C oncogenic protein in MCC progression. We show here that MUC1-C is broadly expressed in MCCs and at higher levels in Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV)-positive (MCCP) relative to MCPyV-negative (MCCN) tumors. Our results further demonstrate that MUC1-C is expressed in MCCP, as well as MCCN, cell lines and regulates common sets of signaling pathways related to RNA synthesis, processing, and transport in both subtypes. Mechanistically, MUC1-C (i) interacts with MYCL, which drives MCC progression, (ii) is necessary for expression of the OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, MYC, and NANOG pluripotency factors, and (iii) induces the NEUROD1, BRN2 and ATOH1 NE lineage dictating transcription factors. We show that MUC1-C is also necessary for MCCP and MCCN cell survival by suppressing DNA replication stress, the p53 pathway, and apoptosis. In concert with these results, targeting MUC1-C genetically and pharmacologically inhibits MCC self-renewal capacity and tumorigenicity. These findings demonstrate that MCCP and MCCN cells are addicted to MUC1-C and identify MUC1-C as a potential target for MCC treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4281976942,"Neurosteroids, modulators of neuronal and glial cell functions, are synthesized in the nervous system from cholesterol. In peripheral steroidogenic tissues, cholesterol is converted to the major steroid precursor pregnenolone by the CYP11A1 enzyme. Although pregnenolone is one of the most abundant neurosteroids in the brain, expression of CYP11A1 is difficult to detect. We found that human glial cells produced pregnenolone, detectable by mass spectrometry and ELISA, despite the absence of observable immunoreactive CYP11A1 protein. Unlike testicular and adrenal cortical cells, pregnenolone production in glial cells was not inhibited by CYP11A1 inhibitors DL-aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole. Furthermore, addition of hydroxycholesterols increased pregnenolone synthesis, suggesting desmolase activity that was not blocked by DL-aminoglutethimide or ketoconazole. We explored three different possibilities for an alternative pathway for glial cell pregnenolone synthesis: (1) regulation by reactive oxygen species, (2) metabolism via a different CYP11A1 isoform, and (3) metabolism via another CYP450 enzyme. First, we found oxidants and antioxidants had no significant effects on pregnenolone synthesis, suggesting it is not regulated by reactive oxygen species. Second, overexpression of CYP11A1 isoform b did not alter synthesis, indicating use of another CYP11A1 isoform is unlikely. Finally, we show nitric oxide and iron chelators deferoxamine and deferiprone significantly inhibited pregnenolone production, indicating involvement of another CYP450 enzyme. Ultimately, knockdown of endoplasmic reticulum cofactor NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase had no effect, while knockdown of mitochondrial CYP450 cofactor ferredoxin reductase inhibited pregnenolone production. These data suggest that pregnenolone is synthesized by a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzyme other than CYP11A1 in human glial cells."
https://openalex.org/W4281657009,"Outpatient care for children and adolescents with chronic conditions needs to be continuous and programmed, encompassing comprehensive care, with periodically scheduled consultations, exams, and procedures, to promote quality of life and reduce mortality. In the context of the new coronavirus pandemic, however, outpatient care for children and adolescents with chronic conditions, in person, was hampered in favor of social isolation, a necessary sanitary measure to reduce and prevent the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019. In response to this need, studies suggest telehealth in pediatrics as a fertile and expanding field especially in times of pandemics. Here, we aimed to map the evidence related to telehealth in outpatient care for children and adolescents with chronic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic, to identify which strategies were implemented and their impacts on the continuity of care.A scoping review protocol is reported and guided by the Scoping Reviews Manual of the Joanna Briggs Institute. The search for evidence will cover the following databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Libary; Embase; Web of Science; Scopus; Cinahl and PsycINFO, plus additional sources, such as The British Library, Google Scholar, and Preprints [medRXiv]. No date or language restrictions will be employed in this scoping review. Two independent researchers will conduct the search strategy, study selection, data charting, and data synthesis.The findings will be presented through tables, charts, narrative summaries, and assessed based on the type of data charted as well as outcomes. Additionally, the meaning of these findings will be considered as they relate to the guiding question, the characterization and measurement of the impact of different telehealth modalities used in outpatient care for children and adolescents with chronic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the implications for practice and further research.To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first scoping review to look specifically at the telehealth modalities to be used in outpatient care for children and adolescents with chronic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect that our results will be of interest to practitioners as well as researchers concerned with this particular emerging issue in the pandemic context. Also, the plans for the dissemination of this study comprise peer-reviewed publication and conference presentations.Open Science Framework Registration: osf.io/5pqgu."
https://openalex.org/W4281703755,"Extinction learning is central to exposure-based behavioral therapies for reducing fear and anxiety in humans. However, patients with fear and anxiety disorders are often resistant to extinction. Moreover, trauma and stress-related disorders are highly prone to relapse and are twice as likely to occur in females compared to males, suggesting that females may be more susceptible to extinction deficits and fear relapse phenomena. In this report, we tested this hypothesis by examining sex differences in a stress-induced extinction learning impairment, the immediate extinction deficit (IED), and renewal, a common form of fear relapse. In contrast to our hypothesis, there were no sex differences in the magnitude of the immediate extinction deficit in two different rat strains (Long-Evans and Wistar). However, we did observe a sex difference in the renewal of fear when the extinguished conditioned stimulus was presented outside the extinction context. Male Wistar rats exhibited significantly greater renewal than female rats, a sex difference that has previously been reported after appetitive extinction. Collectively, these data reveal that stress-induced extinction impairments are similar in male and female rats, though the context-dependence of extinction is more pronounced in males."
https://openalex.org/W4281676048,"Parkin and PINK1 regulate a mitochondrial quality control system that is mutated in some early onset forms of Parkinson's disease. Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and regulated by the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 via a two-step cascade. PINK1 first phosphorylates ubiquitin, which binds a recruitment site on parkin to localize parkin to damaged mitochondria. In the second step, PINK1 phosphorylates parkin on its ubiquitin-like domain (Ubl), which binds a regulatory site to release ubiquitin ligase activity. Recently, an alternative feed-forward mechanism was identified that bypasses the need for parkin phosphorylation through the binding of a second phosphoubiquitin (pUb) molecule. Here, we report the structure of parkin activated through this feed-forward mechanism. The crystal structure of parkin with pUb bound to both the recruitment and regulatory sites reveals the molecular basis for differences in specificity and affinity of the two sites. We use isothermal titration calorimetry measurements to reveal cooperativity between the two binding sites and the role of linker residues for pUbl binding to the regulatory site. The observation of flexibility in the process of parkin activation offers hope for the future design of small molecules for the treatment of Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W4281906106,"Capsule endoscopy has been widely used as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for small or large intestinal lesions. In recent years, automated lesion detection systems using machine learning have been devised. This study aimed to develop an automated system for capsule endoscopic severity in patients with ulcerative colitis along the entire length of the colon using ResNet50. Capsule endoscopy videos from patients with ulcerative colitis were collected prospectively. Each single examination video file was partitioned into four segments: the cecum and ascending colon, transverse colon, descending and sigmoid colon, and rectum. Fifty still pictures (576 × 576 pixels) were extracted from each partitioned video. A patch (128 × 128 pixels) was trimmed from the still picture at every 32-pixel-strides. A total of 739,021 patch images were manually classified into six categories: 0) Mayo endoscopic subscore (MES) 0, 1) MES1, 2) MES2, 3) MES3, 4) inadequate quality for evaluation, and 5) ileal mucosa. ResNet50, a deep learning framework, was trained using 483,644 datasets and validated using 255,377 independent datasets. In total, 31 capsule endoscopy videos from 22 patients were collected. The accuracy rates of the training and validation datasets were 0.992 and 0.973, respectively. An automated evaluation system for the capsule endoscopic severity of ulcerative colitis was developed. This could be a useful tool for assessing topographic disease activity, thus decreasing the burden of image interpretation on endoscopists."
https://openalex.org/W4281615059,"Cancer consistently remains one of the top causes of death in the United States every year, with many cancer deaths preventable if detected early. Circulating serum miRNAs are a promising, minimally invasive supplement or even an alternative to many current screening procedures. Many studies have shown that different serum miRNAs can discriminate healthy individuals from those with certain types of cancer. Although many of those miRNAs are often reported to be significant in one cancer type, they are also altered in other cancer types. Currently, very few studies have investigated serum miRNA biomarkers for multiple cancer types for general cancer screening purposes.To identify serum miRNAs that would be useful in screening multiple types of cancers, microarray cancer datasets were curated, yielding 13 different types of cancer with a total of 3352 cancer samples and 2809 non-cancer samples. The samples were divided into training and validation sets. One hundred random forest models were built using the training set to select candidate miRNAs. The selected miRNAs were then used in the validation set to see how well they differentiate cancer from normal samples in an independent dataset. Furthermore, the interactions between these miRNAs and their target mRNAs were investigated.The random forest models achieved an average of 97% accuracy in the training set with 95% bootstrap confidence interval of 0.9544 to 0.9778. The selected miRNAs were hsa-miR-663a, hsa-miR-6802-5p, hsa-miR-6784-5p, hsa-miR-3184-5p, and hsa-miR-8073. Each miRNA exhibited high area under the curve (AUC) value using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Moreover, the combination of four out of five miRNAs achieved the highest AUC value of 0.9815 with high sensitivity of 0.9773, indicating that these miRNAs have a high potential for cancer screening. miRNA-mRNA and protein-protein interaction analysis provided insights into how these miRNAs play a role in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4281645026,"Our objective was to estimate the impact of universal varicella vaccination (UVV) on the use and costs of antibiotics and antivirals for the management of varicella among children in the United States (US).A decision tree model of varicella vaccination, infections and treatment decisions was developed. Results were extrapolated to the 2017 population of 73.5 million US children. Model parameters were populated from published sources. Treatment decisions were derived from a survey of health care professionals' recommendations. The base case modelled current vaccination coverage rates in the US with additional scenarios analyses conducted for 0%, 20%, and 80% coverage and did not account for herd immunity benefits.Our model estimated that 551,434 varicella cases occurred annually among children ≤ 18 years in 2017. Antivirals or antibiotics were prescribed in 23.9% of cases, with unvaccinated children receiving the majority for base case. The annual cost for varicella antiviral and antibiotic treatment was approximately $14 million ($26 per case), with cases with no complications accounting for $12 million. Compared with the no vaccination scenario, the current vaccination rates resulted in savings of $181 million (94.7%) for antivirals and $78 million (95.0%) for antibiotics annually. Scenario analyses showed that higher vaccination coverage (from 0% to 80%) resulted in reduced annual expenditures for antivirals (from $191 million to $41 million), and antibiotics ($82 million to $17 million).UVV was associated with significant reductions in the use of antibiotics and antivirals and their associated costs in the US. Higher vaccination coverage was associated with lower use and costs of antibiotics and antivirals for varicella management."
https://openalex.org/W4281670419,"Complement component C1q is a protein complex of the innate immune system with well-characterized binding partners that constitutes part of the classical complement pathway. In addition, C1q was recently described in the central nervous system as having a role in synapse elimination both in the healthy brain and in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the molecular mechanism of C1q-associated synapse phagocytosis is still unclear. Here, we designed monomer and multimer protein constructs, which comprised the globular interaction recognition parts of mouse C1q (globular part of C1q [gC1q]) as single-chain molecules (sc-gC1q proteins) lacking the collagen-like effector region. These molecules, which can competitively inhibit the function of C1q, were expressed in an Escherichia coli expression system, and their structure and capabilities to bind known complement pathway activators were validated by mass spectrometry, analytical size-exclusion chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, CD spectroscopy, and ELISA. We further characterized the interactions between these molecules and immunoglobulins and neuronal pentraxins using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. We demonstrated that sc-gC1qs potently inhibited the function of C1q. Furthermore, these sc-gC1qs competed with C1q in binding to the embryonal neuronal cell membrane. We conclude that the application of sc-gC1qs can reveal neuronal localization and functions of C1q in assays in vivo and might serve as a basis for engineering inhibitors for therapeutic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W4281924009,"Using specific photoreceptors, plants can sense light signals fundamental to their growth and development under changing light conditions. Phytochromes sense red and far-red light, cryptochromes and phototropins sense UV-A and blue light, while the UVR8 gene senses UV-B signals. The study of the molecular mechanisms used by plants to respond to artificial biophilic lighting is of pivotal importance for the implementation of biophilic approaches in indoor environments. CoeLux® is a new lighting system that reproduces the effect of natural sunlight entering through an opening in the ceiling, with a realistic sun perceived at an infinite distance surrounded by a clear blue sky. We used the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to assess the gene expression of the main plant photoreceptors at different light intensities and at different times after exposure to the CoeLux® light type, using high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps as control light type. Genes belonging to different families of photoreceptors showed a similar expression pattern, suggesting the existence of a common upstream regulation of mRNA transcription. In particular, PHYA, PHYC, PHYD, CRY1, CRY2, PHOT1, and UVR8, showed a common expression pattern with marked differences between the two light types applied; under the HPS light type, the expression levels are raising with the decrease of light intensity, while under the CoeLux® light type, the expression levels remain nearly constant at a high fold. Moreover, we showed that under biophilic illumination the light spectrum plays a crucial role in the response of plants to light intensity, both at the molecular and morphological levels."

The present study aimed to assess the self-reported adverse reactions following COVID-19 vaccination as a possible tool to increase the trust in vaccines. A cross-sectional survey-based study, covering 761 vaccinated respondents, was conducted in Plovdiv (469 with an mRNA vaccine and 292 with an adenoviral vector vaccine). Descriptive statistics parametric and non-parametric methods were applied. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. The median age of the respondents was 42 years, females (72.5%). At least one adverse reaction was reported in 89.9% of those immunized with mRNA vaccine and 93.8% in the adenoviral vector vaccine group (p&gt;0.05). They were mild to moderate and resolved within several days. The levels of local reactions were comparable: 91.7% in those who received mRNA and 89.7% in those who received an adenoviral vector vaccine (p = 0.366). The most common types of systemic reactions were fatigue, headache, and muscle pains. An association was found between the systemic reactions and the type of vaccine administered: 59.7% in mRNA recipients and 89.4% in adenoviral vector vaccinees (p&lt;0.001). None of the registered systemic reactions required medical attention. There were 3 reports of generalized urticaria after an mRNA and 2 after an adenoviral vector vaccine. The reported reactions are relatively high but expected and no adverse events have been reported that are not listed in the official Summary of Product Characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W4281664767,"Mevalonate 3,5-bisphosphate decarboxylase is involved in the recently discovered Thermoplasma-type mevalonate pathway. The enzyme catalyzes the elimination of the 3-phosphate group from mevalonate 3,5-bisphosphate as well as concomitant decarboxylation of the substrate. This entire reaction of the enzyme resembles the latter half-reactions of its homologs, diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase and phosphomevalonate decarboxylase, which also catalyze ATP-dependent phosphorylation of the 3-hydroxyl group of their substrates. However, the crystal structure of mevalonate 3,5-bisphosphate decarboxylase and the structural reasons of the difference between reactions catalyzed by the enzyme and its homologs are unknown. In this study, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of mevalonate 3,5-bisphosphate decarboxylase from Picrophilus torridus, a thermoacidophilic archaeon of the order Thermoplasmatales. Structural and mutational analysis demonstrated the importance of a conserved aspartate residue for enzyme activity. In addition, although crystallization was performed in the absence of substrate or ligands, residual electron density having the shape of a fatty acid was observed at a position overlapping the ATP-binding site of the homologous enzyme, diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase. This finding is in agreement with the expected evolutionary route from phosphomevalonate decarboxylase (ATP-dependent) to mevalonate 3,5-bisphosphate decarboxylase (ATP-independent) through the loss of kinase activity. We found that the binding of geranylgeranyl diphosphate, an intermediate of the archeal isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway, evoked significant activation of mevalonate 3,5-bisphosphate decarboxylase, and several mutations at the putative geranylgeranyl diphosphate-binding site impaired this activation, suggesting the physiological importance of ligand binding as well as a possible novel regulatory system employed by the Thermoplasma-type mevalonate pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4281681790,"The present work investigates a novel four-port, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), single element dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) for sub-6 GHz band. The DRA is designed and fabricated into a symmetric cross shape and fed using a coplanar waveguide (CPW) feed. A single radiator with four ports is rarely found in the literature. The -10 dB impedance bandwidth covered by the antenna is from 5.52 GHz to 6.2 GHz (11.6%) which covers fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) bands N47 and wireless local area network (WLAN) IEEE 802.11a band. The isolation between orthogonal ports is about 15 dB while the isolation between opposite ports is 12 dB. The radiation pattern of the proposed antenna is bidirectional due to the absence of a ground plane below the DRA. The orthogonal modes excited in the DRA are [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] through the four symmetrical CPW feeds. The simulated and measured results of the proposed design show that MIMO characteristics are achieved by pattern diversity between the ports. Due to the perfect symmetry of the design, the proposed work could be extended to MIMO array applications as well."

https://openalex.org/W4281630154,"In climbing, the visual system is confronted with a dual demand: controlling ongoing movement and searching for upcoming movement possibilities. The aims of the present research were: (i) to investigate the effect of different modes of practice on how learners deal with this dual demand; and (ii) to analyze the extent this effect may facilitate transfer of learning to a new climbing route. The effect of a constant practice, an imposed schedule of variations and a self-controlled schedule of variations on the gaze behaviors and the climbing fluency of novices were compared. Results showed that the constant practice group outperformed the imposed variability group on the training route and the three groups climbing fluency on the transfer route did not differ. Analyses of the gaze behaviors showed that the constant practice group used more online gaze control during the last session whereas the imposed variability group relied on a more proactive gaze control. This last gaze pattern was also used on the transfer route by the imposed variability group. Self-controlled variability group displayed more interindividual differences in gaze behaviors. These findings reflect that learning protocols induce different timing for gaze patterns that may differently facilitate adaptation to new climbing routes."
https://openalex.org/W4281647210,"Molecular biology techniques are increasingly being used in sex identification of skeletal remains when traditional anthropometric analyzes are not successful in identifying sex of remains that are incomplete, fragmented and /or of immature individuals. In the present work, we investigated the possibility of determining sex by using the qPCR-duplex method for both ancient and modern DNA samples. This method involves the co-amplification of two genes in a single reaction system and the subsequent analysis of the fusion curves; the gene sequences used for the construction of suitable primers are those of steroid sulfatase (STS) and testis specific protein Y-linked 1 (TSPY) genes which turned out to be two sensitive markers as they have a detection limit of 60 pg and 20 pg respectively on modern DNA. The validity of the method was verified on modern DNA in which gender was identified in all the samples with 100% accuracy; thus, allowing for the same results as the classic method with amelogenin, but in a faster and more immediate way, as it allows for sex determination solely by analyzing the denaturation curves without having to perform an electrophoretic run. The proposed molecular technique proves to be sensitive and precise even on degraded DNA, in fact on 9 archaeological finds dating from the VII-XII century in which sex had been identified through anthropometric analysis, it confirmed the sex of 8 out of 9 finds correctly."

In contrast, community based epidemiological studies target people with influenza-like illness (ILI) that self-reported influenza-like symptoms whether they have medical examinations or not. Because the criteria for influenza surveillance systems and ILI differ, there is a gap between them. The purpose of this study was to clarify this gap using school-based survey data. Methods Questionnaires about both ILI and the influenza diagnosis history during the 2018/19 season were administered to the guardians of 11,684 elementary schoolchildren in a single city in Japan. Based on their responses, a Bayesian model was constructed to estimate the probability of infection, ILI onset, and diagnosis at medical institutions. Results Responses were obtained from guardians of 10,309 children (88.2%). Of these, 3,380 children (32.8%) had experienced ILI, with 2,380 (23.1%) diagnosed as influenza at a medical institution. Bayesian estimation showed that the probability of influenza cases being diagnosed among ILI symptomatic children was 70% (95% credible interval, 69–71%). Of the infected children, 5% were without ILI symptoms, with 11% of these patients diagnosed with influenza. Conclusions This epidemiological study clarified the proportion gap between ILI and influenza diagnosis among schoolchildren. These results may help to establish epidemic control measures and secure sufficient medical resources."
https://openalex.org/W4281989707,"Due to promote manufacturing enterprises to carry out green technology innovation practice smoothly, achieve the goal of energy conservation and emission reduction, and win green competitive advantage, this paper first divides the green technology innovation path into two types, namely internal independent R&D of green technology (IIGT) and external green technology introduction (EGTI), and analyzes the operation mechanism of these two types of paths. Secondly, a two-agent game model of different types of environmental regulation tools on the choice of green technology innovation path of manufacturing enterprises is constructed. To be sure, the manufacturing enterprises include the leader enterprise A and the follower enterprise B. It is assumed that the two groups of manufacturing enterprises produce the same products or provide the same services in the natural state without considering other influencing factors. Finally, stability analysis and numerical simulation are employed to compare and analyze the heterogeneous effects of different environmental regulation tools on the path selection of green technology innovation in manufacturing enterprises.The simulation shows that when the government adopts or does not adopt environmental regulation means, the system, leader enterprise A and follower enterprise B will eventually choose the path of IIGT or EGTI respectively after a long-term evolution process. However, the effects of subsidy for green technology innovation and carbon tax rate on the path selection of green technology innovation are different among the three parties. Specifically, when the government adopts the means of subsidy for green technology innovation, the leader enterprise A will actively choose the the path of IIGT earlier than the follower enterprise B. On the contrary, when the government adopts the means of carbon tax, the leader enterprise A will actively choose the the path of IIGT later than the follower enterprise B. The research of this paper is helpful to explore the green and sustainable development mode of China's manufacturing industry under the dual constraints of environment and resources, and provides decision support for the relevant national departments to make relevant policies."
https://openalex.org/W4282016506,"α-Synuclein (α-syn) proteinopathy in the neurons of the Enteric Nervous System (ENS) is proposed to have a critical role in Parkinson’s disease (PD) onset and progression. Interestingly, the ENS of the human appendix harbors abundant α-syn and appendectomy has been linked to a decreased risk and delayed onset of PD, suggesting that the appendix may influence PD pathology. Common marmosets and rhesus macaques lack a distinct appendix (a narrow closed-end appendage with a distinct change in diameter at the junction with the cecum), yet the cecal microanatomy of these monkeys is similar to the human appendix. Sections of human appendix (n = 3) and ceca from common marmosets (n = 4) and rhesus macaques (n = 3) were evaluated to shed light on the microanatomy and the expression of PD-related proteins. Analysis confirmed that the human appendix and marmoset and rhesus ceca present thick walls comprised of serosa, muscularis externa, submucosa, and mucosa plus abundant lymphoid tissue. Across all three species, the myenteric plexus of the ENS was located within the muscularis externa with nerve fibers innervating all layers of the appendix/ceca. Expression of α-syn and tau in the appendix/cecum was present within myenteric ganglia and along nerve fibers of the muscularis externa and mucosa in all species. In the myenteric ganglia α-syn, p-α-syn, tau and p-tau immunoreactivities (ir) were not significantly different across species. The percent area above threshold of α-syn-ir and tau-ir in the nerve fibers of the muscularis externa and mucosa were greater in the human appendix than in the NHP ceca (α-syn-ir p&lt;0.05; tau-ir p&lt;0.05). Overall, this study provides critical translational evidence that the common marmoset and rhesus macaque ceca are remarkably similar to the human appendix and, thus, that these NHP species are suitable for studying the development of PD linked to α-syn and tau pathological changes in the ENS."
https://openalex.org/W4281615232,"Two studies investigated whether lower socioeconomic status (SES) would be associated with greater tolerance for unfair treatments. Specifically, we hypothesized that individuals with lower SES would be less likely to perceive apparent injustice as unfair than those with higher SES, and furthermore, such differences in perception would lead to the corresponding differences in ensuing psychological responses. In support of the hypotheses, we found that (Study 1, N = 326; Study 2, N = 130), compared with higher SES participants, lower SES participants perceived one-sidedly disadvantageous distribution during the dictator game as less unfair. Moreover, a behavioral experiment in Study 2 showed that such tolerance for unfair treatments were associated with subsequent passive reactions in the ultimatum game. Taken together, the results imply a vicious cycle whereby the SES differences in a tendency to accept unfair treatments lead to psychological responses that may maintain or even strengthen the existing social disparities."

The aim of the study was to investigate the use DSC in order to detect saliva thermal profiles and determine the most appropriate sampling procedure to collect and process saliva. Saliva was collected from 25 healthy young individuals and processed using different protocols based on centrifugation and filtering. The most effective protocol was centrifugation at 5000g for 10 min at 4°C followed by filtration through Millex 0.45 μm filter. Prepared samples were transferred to 3 mL calorimetric ampoules and then loaded into TAM48 calibrated to 30°C until analysis. DSC scans were recorded from 30°C to 90°C at a scan rate of 1°C/h with a pre-conditioning the samples to starting temperature for 1 h. The results show that the peak distribution of protein melting points was clearly bimodal, and the majority of peaks appeared between 40-50°C. Another set of peaks is visible between 65°C- 75°C. Additionally, the peak amplitude and area under the peak are less affected by the concentration of protein in the sample than by the individual differences between people. In conclusion, the study shows that with right preparation of the samples, there is a possibility to have thermograms of salivary proteins that show peaks in similar temperature regions between different healthy volunteers."
https://openalex.org/W4281630588,"At present, maintenance therapy with the antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab or with PARP-inhibitors represent two options for BRCA-wildtype ovarian cancer patients, after platinum-based first line chemotherapy. The identification of molecular markers to predict patient response to different maintenance therapies remains a major challenge. In the present study we analyzed the predictive potential of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) to identify ovarian cancer patients that might benefit from an antiangiogenic therapy.101 patients with primary epithelial ovarian cancer were analyzed for serum levels of VEGF-A,-C and CA-125 by ELISA. Serum levels were compared between patients with low pT-stage (pT1a-pT2c n = 11), healthy individuals (n = 27) and patients with higher pT-stage (> = pT3 n = 90). Adjusted ROC curves and an adjusted logistic regression model were carried out to evaluate the potential impact of VEGF-A and -C, as well as CA-125 serum level concentration on bevacizumab-therapy response, under consideration of covariates such as FIGO, pM, pN and residual tumor after surgery.A patient which has in comparison twice the VEGF-C concentration in serum, has a significant increased chance of response to bevacizumab by a factor of 2.79. Further, only VEGF-C serum levels were significantly higher in the group of patients with lower pT-stage compared to healthy individuals, whereas VEGF-A or CA-125 serum levels could not discriminate between healthy individuals and patients with ovarian cancer at low pT-stages.VEGF-C serum level might serve as as a biomarker to evaluate treatment response under bevacizumab."
https://openalex.org/W4281646830,"Stigma towards people with mental health problems is a growing issue across the world, to which healthcare providers might contribute. The aim of the present study was to explore psychiatrists' attitudes towards their patients and link them to psychosocial and professional factors.An online questionnaire was used to approach the in- and outpatient psychiatric services across Hungary. A total of 211 trainees and specialists in adult and child psychiatry participated in our study. Their overall stigmatizing attitudes were measured, with focus on attitude, disclosure and help-seeking, and social distance dimensions by using the self-report Opening Minds Stigma Scale for Health Care Providers (OMS-HC). Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to elucidate the dimensions of stigma and its association with sociodemographic, professional and personal traits.Stigmatizing attitudes of close colleagues towards patients were statistically significant predictors of higher scores on the attitude [B = 0.235 (0.168-0.858), p = 0.004], the disclosure and help-seeking subscales [B = 0.169 (0.038-0.908), p = 0.033], and the total score of the OMS-HC [B = 0.191 (0.188-1.843), p = 0.016]. Psychiatrists who had already sought help for their own problems had lower scores on the disclosure and help-seeking subscale [B = 0.202 (0.248-1.925), p = 0.011]. The overall stigmatizing attitude was predicted by the openness to participate in case discussion, supervision or Balint groups [B = 0.166 (0.178-5.886), p = 0.037] besides the more favorable attitudes of their psychiatrist colleagues [B = 0.191 (0.188-1.843), p = 0.016].The favorable attitudes of psychiatrists are associated with their own experiences with any kind of psychiatric condition, previous help-seeking behavior and the opportunity to work together with fellow psychiatrists, whose attitudes are less stigmatizing. The perception of fellow colleagues' attitudes towards patients and the openness to case discussion, supervision and Balint groups were the main two factors that affected the overall attitudes towards patients; therefore, these should be considered when tailoring anti-stigma interventions for psychiatrists."

We developed a new protective device to reduce the risk of aerosol diffusion and droplet infection among healthcare workers. Here, we report the results of a theoretical evaluation of the efficacy of this device.We used suction-capable masks with and without rubber slits, sleeves for the insertion section of endoscopes and treatment tools, and a cover for the control section of the endoscope. To simulate droplet spread from patients, we created a droplet simulation model and an aerosol simulation model. The results with and without the devices attached and with and without the suction were compared.The droplet simulation model showed a 95% reduction in droplets with masks with rubber slits; furthermore, a reduction of 100% was observed when the insertion sleeve was used. Evaluation of aerosol simulation when suction was applied revealed an aerosol reduction of 98% and >99% with the use of the mask without rubber slits and with the combined use of the mask and insertion sleeve, respectively. The elimination of droplet emission upon instrument removal confirmed that the instrument sleeve prevented the diffusion of droplets. The elimination of droplets upon repeated pressing of the suction button confirmed that the cover prevented the diffusion of droplets.We developed a device for infection control, in collaboration with a gastrointestinal endoscopist and Olympus Medical Systems Corporation, that was effective in reducing droplet and aerosol diffusion in this initial theoretical assessment."
https://openalex.org/W4281669708,"During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare facilities worldwide struggled to adequately care for the increasing number of COVID-19 patients while maintaining quality of care for all other patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the displacement and underuse of non-COVID-19 patient care in a medical department of a tertiary hospital in Switzerland. In this retrospective cross-sectional study, internal medicine admissions from 2017 to 2020, emergency outpatient visits from 2019 to 2020 and COVID-19 admissions in 2020 were analyzed and compared using a regression model. Internal medicine admissions were also stratified by diagnosis. A questionnaire was used to assess the pandemic experience of local general practitioners, referring hospitals, and nursing homes. The total number of admissions decreased during the 1st and 2nd waves of the pandemic but increased between the two waves. Elective admissions decreased in 2020 compared to pre-pandemic years: they represented 25% of total admissions in 2020 versus 30% of the total admissions during 2017-2019, p <0.001. Admissions for emergency reasons increased: 71% in 2020 versus 65% in 2017-2019, p < 0.001. Emergency outpatient consultations decreased in 2020 compared to 2019, 62.77 (14.70), mean (SD), weekly visits in 2020 versus 74.13 (13.98) in 2019, p<0.001. Most general practitioners and heads of referring hospitals also reported a decrease in consultations, especially during the 1st wave of the pandemic. Mental illnesses, anxiety or burn-out were perceived in both patients and staff in general practices and nursing homes. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the care of non-COVID-19 patients, particularly those with chronic illnesses. A shift of health care resources from non-COVID patients to COVID patients was observed. These findings could help institutions better manage such a situation in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4281738557,"Contact tracing is a key component of successful management of COVID-19. Contacts of infected individuals are asked to quarantine, which can significantly slow down (or prevent) community spread. Contact tracing is particularly effective when infections are detected quickly, when contacts are traced with high probability, when the initial number of cases is low, and when social distancing and border restrictions are in place. However, the magnitude of the individual contribution of these factors in reducing epidemic spread and the impact of population immunity (due to either previous infection or vaccination), in determining contact tracing outputs is not fully understood. We present a delayed differential equation model to investigate how the immunity status and the relaxation of social distancing requirements affect contact tracing practices. We investigate how the minimal contact tracing efficiency required to keep an outbreak under control depends on the contact rate and on the proportion of immune individuals. Additionally, we consider how delays in outbreak detection and increased case importation rates affect the number of contacts to be traced daily. We show that in communities that have reached a certain immunity status, a lower contact tracing efficiency is required to avoid a major outbreak, and delayed outbreak detection and relaxation of border restrictions do not lead to a significantly higher risk of overwhelming contact tracing. We find that investing in testing programs, rather than increasing the contact tracing capacity, has a larger impact in determining whether an outbreak will be controllable. This is because early detection activates contact tracing, which will slow, and eventually reverse exponential growth, while the contact tracing capacity is a threshold that will easily become overwhelmed if exponential growth is not curbed. Finally, we evaluate quarantine effectiveness in relation to the immunity status of the population and for different viral variants. We show that quarantine effectiveness decreases with increasing proportion of immune individuals, and increases in the presence of more transmissible variants. These results suggest that a cost-effective approach is to establish different quarantine rules for immune and nonimmune individuals, where rules should depend on viral transmissibility after vaccination or infection. Altogether, our study provides quantitative information for contact tracing downsizing in vaccinated populations or in populations that have already experienced large community outbreaks, to guide COVID-19 exit strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4281762845,"O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is the distinctive enzyme responsible for catalyzing O-GlcNAc addition to the serine or threonine residues of thousands of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins involved in such basic cellular processes as DNA damage repair, RNA splicing, and transcription preinitiation and initiation complex assembly. However, the molecular mechanism by which OGT regulates gene transcription remains elusive. Using proximity labeling-based mass spectrometry, here, we searched for functional partners of OGT and identified interacting protein Dot1L, a conserved and unique histone methyltransferase known to mediate histone H3 Lys79 methylation, which is required for gene transcription, DNA damage repair, cell proliferation, and embryo development. Although this specific interaction with OGT does not regulate the enzymatic activity of Dot1L, we show that it does facilitate OGT-dependent histone O-GlcNAcylation. Moreover, we demonstrate that OGT associates with Dot1L at transcription start sites and that depleting Dot1L decreases OGT associated with chromatin globally. Notably, we also show that downregulation of Dot1L reduces the levels of histone H2B S112 O-GlcNAcylation and histone H2B K120 ubiquitination in vivo, which are associated with gene transcription regulation. Taken together, these results reveal that O-GlcNAcylation of chromatin is dependent on Dot1L."
https://openalex.org/W4281783622,"Embodied and grounded cognition theories state that cognitive processing is built upon sensorimotor systems. In the context of numerical cognition, support to this framework comes from the interactions between numerical processing and the hand actions of reaching and grasping documented in skilled adults. Accordingly, mechanisms for the processing of object size and location during reach and grasp actions might scaffold the development of mental representations of numerical magnitude. The present study exploited motor adaptation to test the hypothesis of a functional overlap between neurocognitive mechanisms of hand action and numerical processing. Participants performed repetitive grasping of an object, repetitive pointing, repetitive tapping, or passive viewing. Subsequently, they performed a symbolic number comparison task. Importantly, hand action and number comparison were functionally and temporally dissociated, thereby minimizing context-based effects. Results showed that executing the action of pointing slowed down the responses in number comparison. Moreover, the typical distance effect (faster responses for numbers far from the reference as compared to close ones) was not observed for small numbers after pointing, while it was enhanced by grasping. These findings confirm the functional link between hand action and numerical processing, and suggest new hypotheses on the role of pointing as a meaningful gesture in the development and embodiment of numerical skills."
https://openalex.org/W4281896625,"Many studies suggest that species diversity and abiotic factors promote ecosystem multifunctionality. However, whether ecosystem multifunctionality is impacted by phylogenetic diversity remains controversial. The present study tested this in an arid desert ecosystem in Ebinur Lake Basin using soil C:N ratio, soil pH, and soil salinity as abiotic factors, and species diversity and phylogenetic diversity as indicators of plant diversity. The effects of plant diversity and abiotic factors on single ecosystem functions (nutrient cycling, carbon stocks, water regulation, and wood production) and ecosystem multifunctionality were studied. We used structural equation modeling to assess the relationships among different functional groups and factors. The results showed that: (1) abiotic factors, particularly pH and C:N ratio in soil, had the strongest positive impact on multifunctionality (P < 0.001). The phylogenetic diversity and species diversity showed inconsistent changes, and their contribution to multifunctionality were not outstanding. (2) Abiotic factors were closely related to different ecosystem functions. Soil C:N had a significant positive effect on carbon stocks (P < 0.001), with an effect index of 0.89. Soil pH significantly enhanced nutrient cycling and water regulation. The role of plant diversity varied with the combination of different ecosystem functions. Phylogenetic diversity and species diversity influenced wood production, but showed opposite functions. (3) The importance of four single-ecosystem functions in an arid region was ranked as follows: carbon stocks > water regulation > nutrient cycling > wood production, emphasizing the importance of carbon elements in these ecosystems. These results improve our understanding of the drivers of multifunctionality in arid ecosystems, facilitating the elucidation of the influence of abiotic factors and phylogenetic diversity."

From a total of 10,267 participants (6,112 females and 4,155 males), self-reported general health questionnaire, body mass index, self-reported oral health behaviours, panoramic x-rays and the oral health impact profile (OHIP-14) were gathered. Radiographically screened periodontitis was measured through a radiographic-based periodontal bone loss (R-PBL) approach. We compared the respective variables according to the R-PBL status and explored using multiple logistic regression adjusted for the significant variables. Overall, patients with periodontitis shown significantly different sociodemographic, health measures and oral hygiene characteristics. All domains of the OHIP-14 were significantly worsened in the periodontitis group, and further confirmed through adjusted logistic regression (p<0.001). Active smoking, number of missing teeth, sex and age were the most impactful variables in this relationship. Our results demonstrate the existence of a link between radiographically screened periodontitis and OHRQoL, mostly upheld by active smoking, number of missing teeth, sex and age."
https://openalex.org/W4281634026,"Agility and change of direction speed are two different abilities, but no study has investigated if this difference exists also in fatigued conditions, and whether fatigue develops in a different way in a repeated-trial scenario. Fourteen soccer players (age: 17.0 ± 0.4 yrs; height: 176.9 ± 6.5 cm; body mass: 69.2 ± 6.4 kg) competing in a national-level youth league completed in a randomized counter-balanced crossover design a repeated agility protocol (RA) and a repeated change-of-direction one (RCOD), both consisting in performing 20 consecutive repetitions (work:rest ratio 1:5). The 20 repetitions were divided into 4 blocks (each block containing 5 repetitions) for the analysis. Results show that agility and COD are two different abilities both in rest and fatigue conditions: block 1 RA vs 1 RCOD (p < 0.001; ES = 2.02 huge; r = 0.17 poor; r2 = 0.03), 2 RA vs 2 RCOD (p < 0.001; ES = 2.3 huge; r = 0.51 fair; r2 = 0.26), 3 RA vs 3 RCOD (p < 0.001; ES = 2.38 huge; r = 0.54 fair; r2 = 0.29), and 4 RA vs 4 RCOD (p < 0.001; ES = 2.7 huge; r = 0.41 fair; r2 = 0.17). However, the fatigue development in both conditions was similar, with a percentage decrement score (Sdec) of 7.5% for RA, and 7.3% for RCOD. Ratings of perceived exertions (RPE) were similar too (7.3 ± 1.7, and 6.6 ± 1.9, for RA and RCOD, respectively). However, a significant fatigue-related performance impairment arose earlier in RA (block 2) than in RCOD (block 3). Total RA and total RCOD times were significantly different (p < 0.001; ES = 2.65 huge; r = 0.41 fair; r2 = 0.17), suggesting that they are two different and independent abilities."

Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays are considered the 'gold standard' for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. However, the labor and resource requirements can be prohibitive with respect to large testing volumes associated with the pandemic. Pooled testing algorithms may serve to increase testing capacity with more efficient resource utilization. Due to the lack of carefully curated cohorts, there is limited evidence for the applicability of RT-PCR pooling in asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. In this study, we compared the analytical sensitivity of the TaqMan™ SARS-CoV-2 Pooling Assay to detect one positive sample in a pool of five anterior nares swabs in symptomatic and asymptomatic cohorts at an institute of higher education. Positive pools were deconvoluted and each individual sample was retested using the TaqPath™ COVID-19 Combo Kit. Both assays target the open reading frame (ORF) 1ab, nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) gene of the strain that originated in Wuhan, Hubei, China. Qualitative results demonstrated absolute agreement between pooled and deconvoluted samples in both cohorts. Independent t-test performed on Ct shifts supported an insignificant difference between cohorts with p-values of 0.306 (Orf1ab), 0.147 (N), and 0.052 (S). All negative pools were correctly reported as negative.

https://openalex.org/W4281661649,"Over most of the last two decades, China's Outward Direct Investment (CODI) has reshaped the global economic landscape and attracted considerable attention. Although extensive research shows that CODI features agglomeration, there is limited research from the perspective of different patterns of agglomeration economies at the subnational level. It is unclear which patterns of agglomeration economies play a role in the location choice of CODI, especially with the variations of CODI in terms of entry mode and ownership. Therefore, based on the data of the CODI in the United States in the period 2000-2016, we use a conditional logit model to investigate the influence of specialized and diversified agglomeration of local firms as well as industry-specific and industry-diverse agglomeration of Chinese investors on the location choice of CODI, and further explore the heterogeneous influence concerning the entry mode and ownership. Our results show that among a variety of agglomeration economies, the specialized agglomeration of local firms is the premier factor influencing the location choice of CODI, even exceeding the influence of industry-specific agglomeration of CODI in the same industry. Industry-diverse agglomeration of CODI plays a weak role, while diversified agglomeration of local firms has no effect. Moreover, the location choice of acquisition is more sensitive to the specialized agglomeration of local firms than that of greenfield investment, and the influence of the industry-diverse agglomeration of CODI has no effect on the location choice of acquisition. In terms of the ownership, the location choice of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is more sensitive to the specialized agglomeration of local firms and industry-specific agglomeration of CODI than that of private investment, and the industry-diverse agglomeration of CODI has no significant impact on the location choice of SOEs' offshoring subsidiaries."
https://openalex.org/W4281663118,"Group hunting is common among social carnivores, and mechanisms that promote this behavior are a central topic in evolutionary biology. Increased prey capture success and decreased losses from competitors are often invoked as factors promoting group hunting. However, many animal societies have linear dominance hierarchies where access to critical resources is determined by social rank, and group-hunting rewards are shared unequally. Despite this inequality, animals in such societies cooperate to hunt and defend resources. Game theoretic models predict that rank and relative rewards from group hunting vs. solitary hunting affect which hunting strategies will evolve. These predictions are partially supported by empirical work, but data needed to test these predictions are difficult to obtain in natural systems. We use digital evolution to test how social rank and tolerance by dominants of subordinates feeding while sharing spoils from group hunting influence which hunting strategies evolve in digital organisms. We created a computer-simulated world to reflect social and hunting dynamics of spotted hyenas ( Crocuta crocuta ). We found that group hunting increased as tolerance increased and as the relative payoff from group hunting increased. Also, top-ranking agents were more likely to group hunt than lower-ranking agents under despotic sharing conditions. These results provide insights into mechanisms that may promote cooperation in animal societies structured by dominance hierarchies."
https://openalex.org/W4281677042,"To study the influence of the gangue content of coal gangue particles on the vibration signal of the tail beam under sliding condition, this paper combines three-dimensional(3D) laser scanning technology with the finite element method, establishes a finite element model of the real shape of coal gangue particles and the hydraulic support in top coal caving in LS-DYNA, analyzes the influence of gangue content on some characteristics of the acceleration signal on the tail beam in the time and frequency domains, and then studies the influence of the size and total mass of the rock, and the angle of the tail beam on the characteristics. The following conclusions are obtained: when the coal gangue particles slip on the tail beam, an increase in gangue content significantly improves the effective value of the acceleration signal of the tail beam in the time domain and the average power and average amplitude in the frequency domain. With different sizes, total masses, and tail beam angles, the increase in gangue content always causes an increase in acceleration signal characteristics. In terms of the influence of various factors on the same gangue content, at the same total mass, the larger the rock mass size is, the faster the characteristic value increases with the increase in gangue content. The greater the total mass, the greater the value of the acceleration signal characteristics. A smaller angle between the tail beam and the ground increases the value of each characteristic. The results of this study provide a reference for further research on coal gangue identification based on vibrations."
https://openalex.org/W4281692419,"Background Intracranial stents are used to treat aneurysms by diverting the blood flow from entering into the aneurysmal dome. Although delayed rupture is rare, clinical outcomes are extremely poor in such cases. Hemodynamics after stent deployment may be related to delayed rupture and a better understanding of the basic characteristics of pressure changes resulting from stent deployment is needed; therefore, this study investigated the relationships between hemodynamics in aneurysms of different sizes treated using stents of different wire mesh densities. Methods Using computational fluid dynamics analysis, parameters related to velocity, volume flow rate, pressure, and residual volume inside the aneurysm were evaluated in digital models of 5 basic aneurysms of differing sizes (Small, Medium, Medium-Large, Large, and Giant) and using 6 different types of stent (varying number of wires, stent pitch and wire mesh density) for each aneurysm. Results Regardless of the aneurysm size, the velocity inside the aneurysm and the volume flow rate into the aneurysm were observed to continuously decrease up to 89.2% and 78.1%, respectively, with increasing stent mesh density. In terms of pressure, for giant aneurysms, the pressure on the aneurysmal surface elevated to 10.3%, then decreased to 5.1% with increasing stent mesh density. However, in smaller aneurysms, this pressure continuously decreased with increasing stent mesh density. The flow-diverting effect of the stents was limited when a stent with low mesh density (under 20%) was used with a giant aneurysm. Conclusions The present results indicate that the selection of appropriate stents according to aneurysm size may contribute to reduced risks of hemodynamic alternations related to stent deployment, which could reduce the incidence of delayed rupture."

In specific, it is a key step to study the relationship between the type and quantity of forage collected by cattle and sheep and their own growth, cashmere fineness, milk quality, meat quality and flavor, and so on. However, traditional method mainly rely on manual observation, which is time-consuming, laborious and inaccurate, and affects the normal grazing behavior of livestock. In this paper, the optimized Convolution Neural Network(CNN): edge autoencoder network(E-A-Net) algorithm is proposed to accurately identify the forage species, which provides the basis for ecological workers to carry out grassland evaluation, grassland management and precision feeding. We constructed the first forage grass dataset about Etuoke Banner. This dataset contains 3889 images in 22 categories. In the data preprocessing stage, the random cutout data enhancement is adopted to balance the original data, and the background is removed by employing threshold value-based image segmentation operation, in which the accuracy of herbage recognition in complex background is significantly improved. Moreover, in order to avoid the phenomenon of richer edge information disappearing in the process of multiple convolutions, a Sobel operator is utilized in this E-A-Net to extract the edge information of forage grasses. Information is integrated with the features extracted from the backbone network in multi-scale. Additionally, to avoid the localization of the whole information during the convolution process or alleviate the problem of the whole information disappearance, the pre-training autoencoder network is added to form a hard attention mechanism, which fuses the abstracted overall features of forage grasses with the features extracted from the backbone CNN. Compared with the basic CNN, E-A-Net alleviates the problem of edge information disappearing and overall feature disappearing with the deepening of network depth. Numerical simulations show that, compared with the benchmark VGG16, ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0, the f1 - score of the proposed method is improved by 1.6%, 2.8% and 3.7% respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4281732657,"Background Optic neuritis is a relatively common disease with an estimated lifetime risk of 0.6 per 1000; the estimated prevalence is 1–5 per 100 000/year. It occurs because of inflammation of the optic nerve from a variety of causes. The diagnosis of the disorder is established clinically and current literature is predominantly based on white patients from high-income countries. Optic neuritis presents differently in black patients compared to white patients. This study aims to assess the presentation and outcome of optic neuritis patients in a South African setting. Methods This is a prospective, hospital-based cohort study that will enrol patients with optic neuritis presenting to either the neurology department at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital or the ophthalmology department at St John Eye Hospital, both in Johannesburg, South Africa. The specific aetiologies, clinical presentation and radiological findings will be studied, and the patient’s course over one year will be documented in three-monthly follow-up visits. A specific group of patients with Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders (NMOSD) and Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein Associated Disorders (MOGAD) optic neuritis will be followed up for 5 years at yearly intervals. Discussion This study represents one of the few cohort studies in Sub-Saharan Africa that seeks to investigate optic neuritis. Our hope is that it will lead to better insights regarding the presentation, course and outcome of this condition. We will also analyse the data with a view of developing a predictive model for good visual outcome."

In India, such variations and their interrelation have not been studied at the sub-district level primarily due to the non-availability of good quality granular data. Given the sheer regional diversity in India, it is essential to develop a region-specific evidence base at the micro-level.The current study utilised, for the first time, a sub-district level survey data (Concurrent Child Monitoring Survey-II, 2014-15) to investigate the statistically significant clusters and spatial patterns of burden of undernutrition among children. The emergence of distinct patterns at the level of natural geographical regions of the state-coastal, southern and northern regions, lead to a region-specific analysis to measure the impact of various demographic, socio-economic and maternal factors on the prevalence of undernutrition specific to the three regions, using the National Family Health Survey-IV unit-level data.The spatial dependence and clustering of child undernourishment across sub-districts in Odisha were studied using various spatial statistical techniques, including spatial econometric models. Binary logistic regression was applied in the region-specific analysis.Findings indicated statistically significant spatial clustering of undernutrition among children in specific geographic pockets with poor sanitation, low institutional and skilled deliveries, poor maternal health reinforcing the need for inter-sectoral coordination. Disparities across the three natural-regions, suggest that the parameters requiring priority for intervention may differ across levels of overall development.The spatial clustering of different socio-demographic indicators in specific geographic pockets highlights the differential impact of these determinants on child undernutrition thereby reinforcing a strong need for targeted intervention in these areas. Present analysis and the evidence-based micro-level analysis can be utilised as a model for other Indian states and low-resource countries, making interventions more effective through multiple, synergistic and a multi-sectoral approach."
https://openalex.org/W4281957926,"In this study, a square wave voltammetric method for determination of theophylline in tablet formulation based on EDTA salt modified carbon paste electrode is presented. CV, FT-IR, and EIS results confirmed modification of the carbon paste with EDTA salt. In contrast to the unmodified carbon paste electrode, the modified carbon paste electrode showed irreversible oxidation of theophylline with considerable current enhancement. Investigation of the effect of scan rate on the Ip and Ep response of the modified electrode for theophylline revealed predominantly diffusion controlled oxidation kinetics. Under the optimized conditions, square wave oxidative peak current of theophylline in pH 7.0 PBS showed linear dependence on concentration in the range 10–200 μM with determination coefficient (R 2 ), limit of detection, and limit of quantification of 0.99782, 0.0257 μM, and 0.0857 μM, respectively. Detection of an amount of theophylline in the analyzed tablet formulation with 1.85% error from its nominal content (120 mg/tablet) confirmed the accuracy of the developed method. Spike and interference recovery results of 98.59%, and 95.7–100%, respectively validated the applicability of the developed method for determination of theophylline content in tablet samples."
