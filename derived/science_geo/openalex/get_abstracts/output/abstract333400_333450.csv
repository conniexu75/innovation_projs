This accounts for the disappearance of gas bubbles at depths greater than 1200 meters. The hydrate should exist from this depth to prise 0.06 percent of the ice."

The radius of curvature of the fracture zone changes at about 47°45′W; this suggests that the fracture zone was generated by rotation of crustal plates about at least two sequential poles."

Events have happened in that interval which mark the close of the Darwinian epoch. Down House, in which Darwin lived and worked, has been bought, restored, and endowed by Mr. Buckston Browne and presented by him to the Association, which holds it in custody for the nation. The house is now open asa shrine to those who treasure Darwin's memory. They may enter the study where the “Origin of Species” was penned, or wander out to the Sand Walk, and draw such inspiration as those spots may yet afford to those who are face to face with problems cognate to his own. These years have also severed personal links with Darwin himself. Sir William Thiselton-Dyer, who died in December 1928, had been his frequent correspondent. It was he who, more than any other, carried the evolutionary stimulus forward into the botanical schools of Britain. Sir Edwin RayLankester, whose portrait by Orpen was a poignant feature of last year's Academy, died in August 1929. Not only was he the leading zoologist of his time, but he has left a deep impress on general morphology; for he was the first to analyse from the evolutionary aspect the degrees of ‘sameness’ of parts, whether in animals or in plants. These two octogenarians were among the latest links between Darwin himself and living men of science; so this last meeting of the Association before its centenary next year falls at a nodal point in the personal history of evolution."

The molecular structure of anhydrous 2-p-toluidinyl-6-naphthalene sulfonate suggests extended electron resonance over the whole molecule and this is one of the causes of the spectral differences."

https://openalex.org/W2019423085,Experiments in our laboratory have demonstrated that white rats fed only fresh whole milk secured enough minerals from their cages to prevent anemia. Animals consuming large amounts of milk became anemic more quickly than those limited to small amounts. Access to feces delayed somewhat the onset of anemia. These results probably explain some of the conflicting data reported in the literature and also raise a question regarding the correctness of conclusions drawn from experiments in which recognition was not given the factors shown in this study to be important.
