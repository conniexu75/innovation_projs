As the basis of this program, almost all structures and functions undergo regular changes within 24 hours. Such rhythms have been described in physiological parameters, such as hormone levels in blood plasma, blood pressure and heart rate, body temperature, and sleep propensity, and in behavioral parameters, such as mood, reaction time, computation speed, and performance in learning tasks. These rhythms normally keep distinct phase-relationships with each other, implying a high degree of internal temporal order. In principle, this rhythmicity is maintained when subjects are sleep deprived, when they are starved, or when they receive equal amounts of food at short intervals over the day. The timing of single meals, however, may influence the pattern of some variables, and the sleep-wake cycle can have phase-setting as well as masking effects on the instantaneous value of rhythms as especially known for body temperature and some hormones."

https://openalex.org/W2062913534,"In concentrated solutions of either 9-ethyladenine or 1-cyclohexyluracil in deuterochloroform, absorption bands in the infrared spectrum demonstrate hydrogen bonding of the adenine and uracil derivatives with themselves. In dilute solutions, there is very little hydrogen bonding. However, when dilute solutions of 9-ethyladenine and 1-cyclohexyluracil are mixed, a series of bands appear which show that these molecules are hydrogen-bonding with each other much more strongly than with themselves. A study of the stoichiometry of this association indicates formation of 1:1 hydrogen-bonded pairs in solution."

https://openalex.org/W2114828970,"This report is the second of two papers dealing with the effect of structure on reactivity in a single, defined step of a chymotrypsin-catalyzed reaction. A previous study of the rates of hydrolysis of a series of substituted benzoyl-chymotrypsins provided evidence for a significant amount of participation of basic or nucleophilic groups in the reaction (l), a conclusion which was reached independently by Bender and Nakamura from a study of the rates of acyl-enzyme formation from a series of substituted phenyl esters (2). The present study was carried out to determine the effect of structure on the reactivity of a series of nucleophilic reagents toward an acyl-chymotrypsin, in the hope that the results would shed some light on the role played by the enzyme in activating the nucleophilic reagent or the acyl group or both for react,ion. It is well known that many alcohols and amines react with acyl-chymotrypsins and there is scattered quantitative data in the literature (3-10). The studies described here were carried out with furoyl-chymotrypsin (1, 3) which is similar to the cinnamoyl-chymotrypsin studied by Bender, Schonbaum, and Zerner (11, 12) in that it undergoes an easily measurable spectral change on reaction, which facilitates rate measurements."

The results are compared with those of analogous experiments on fish, bird, and mammal."

https://openalex.org/W2052226385,"X-IRRADIATION has been shown to interfere with some biosynthetic processes in the cell nucleus of the regenerating liver. A disturbance of DNA synthesis1–3 and of nuclear RNA turnover4 was noted when animals were irradiated with moderate doses of X-rays in the early phase of liver regeneration (2–6 h after partial hepatectomy in the case of RNA), but no effect was observed after X-irradiation in the later stages within 24 h after operation. Similarly, an inhibitory effect of X-irradiation on the total protein turnover in the 23-h regenerating liver was reported to occur in animals exposed to lethal doses of X-irradiation 2–6 h after partial hepatectomy, but not in those irradiated 18 h after operation5. The present communication reports the effect of whole-body X-irradiation, at different time intervals within 24 h after partial hepatectomy, on ammo-acid incorporation into proteins of cell nuclei isolated from a 24-h regenerating liver."
