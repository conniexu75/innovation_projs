https://openalex.org/W1601321432,"A new purification procedure for Escherichia coli DNA polymerase yields about 10 mg of homogeneous enzyme per kg of cell paste, with exonuclease III as a by-product. DNA polymerase consists of a single polypeptide chain of molecular weight 1.09 × 105. This tentative conclusion is based on (a) an unchanged molecular weight after unfolding in solutions containing guanidine hydrochloride and mercaptoethanol, (b) the presence of approximately one residue of NH2-terminal methionine, and (c) the presence of a single zone on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a denaturing solvent at several pH values. The enzyme contains one disulfide bond and a single reactive sulfhydryl group, which can be modified by iodoacetic acid without change in either polymerase or its associated exonuclease activity. There is less than one phosphorus atom per molecule, thus minimizing the possibility of enzyme-associated nucleotide material in stoichiometric amounts."
https://openalex.org/W1568532879,"Stringent strains of Escherichia coli are shown to produce one, and usually two, 32P-labeled compounds specifically in response to amino acid starvation. This pattern of labeling is not observed in three derived relaxed strains. Comparison of properties of the system regulating the synthesis of these compounds with those of the amino acid control of RNA biosynthesis suggests that the unusual compounds participate in an early step in the mechanism which leads to the slowing of RNA biosynthesis during amino acid starvation of stringent strains."

https://openalex.org/W1524822295,"Abstract O-Acetylserine sulfhydrylase-A is one of two highly specific enzymic activities which catalyzes the final step in l-cysteine biosynthesis in Salmonella typhimurium: O-acetyl-l-serine + sulfide → l-cysteine + acetate. The enzyme has been purified to near homogeneity and characterized. It is a pyridoxal phosphate-containing protein of s20,w 4.5 and molecular weight 68,000. Equilibrium sedimentation studies on native and carboxymethylated enzyme, analytical polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis in urea, pyridoxal phosphate analysis, tryptic peptide mapping, and amino acid analysis have shown that O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase-A consists of two identical subunits of molecular weight 34,000. The spectrum of native O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase-A has a visible absorption maximum at 412 mµ due to pyridoxal phosphate. When O-acetyl-l-serine is added to the enzyme, the visible absorption maximum shifts to 470 mµ. This shift is dependent upon the concentration of O-acetyl-l-serine, and the equilibrium constant, determined spectroscopically, for this reaction is 6 x 10-7 m. The shift in spectral absorption does not occur in the presence of sulfide. The Km for O-acetyl-l-serine, measured kinetically, in the presence of both substrates is 5 x 10-3 m."

Reconstitution of active particles in the presence of isolated split proteins allowed the identification of the single split protein responsible for spectinomycin sensitivity."

https://openalex.org/W1511450533,"Abstract The hydrolytic activity associated with homogeneous preparations of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase, previously designated exonuclease II, hydrolyzes polydeoxyribonucleotides from the 5' as well as the 3' terminus. 3'-Phosphate-terminated DNA is hydrolyzed only from the 5' terminus. The principal products of exhaustive hydrolysis of 3'-phosphate-terminated DNA are 5'-mononucleotides and oligonucleotides terminating in a 3'-phosphate group; the latter are not hydrolyzed from either end of the chain. The rates of hydrolysis from either end of a DNA chain are similar with native DNA as substrate. The ability of DNA polymerase to recognize and degrade from the 5' terminus (5' → 3') as well as the 3' terminus (3' → 5') of a DNA chain is considered in relation to possible models for DNA replication and to the active center of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1500960442,"Abstract The absorption and fluorescence properties of formycin provide a useful tool in the analysis of enzyme-substrate interactions; we have therefore studied selected biochemical properties of formycin nucleotides. Formycin and its derivatives effectively substitute for the corresponding adenosine substrates in a wide variety of enzyme reactions. These include enzymes of nucleotide metabolism, RNA polymerase, polynucleotide phosphorylase, aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetases, and the pyrophosphorylase of tRNA. tRNA molecules bearing formycin nucleoside termini are readily aminoacylated and efficiently transfer amino acids into polypeptides. Polymers containing formycin have also been prepared and studied. Certain characteristics of these polynucleotides are paradoxical. Copolymers of formycin are readily synthesized by polymerizing enzymes and efficiently direct polypeptide synthesis in vitro, while the homopolymer of formycin is difficult to synthesize and is inactive in coding experiments."

https://openalex.org/W1595654260,"Abstract Binding of DNA and d(A-T) oligomers to DNA polymerase was studied by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. A single molecule of d(A-T) oligomer is bound by the enzyme, suggesting only one binding site for DNA. The binding is reversible, does not require Mg++, and is inhibited by high concentrations of phosphate. Polymerase binds at multiple sites along single-stranded DNA, but binds to helical DNA only at nicks or at ends of molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1592201898,"Abstract We have examined the functional relationship in vivo between purine ribonucleoside triphosphate pool size and the rate of the RNA accumulation. Our findings are as follows. The imposition of stringency leads to a roughly 40% drop in the GTP pool which occurs very quickly; it is complete in less than 10 min, and occurs simultaneously with, or just before, the shutoff of RNA accumulation. A somewhat slower 30% drop in the ATP pool was also observed. In a relaxed mutant, there is a momentary shrinkage of both pools, but they quickly return to normal and thereafter expand. The shrinkage of the ATP and GTP pools during stringency cannot be accounted for as a feedback response to blockade of RNA accumulation; when RNA accumulation is blocked directly by uracil starvation, the ATP and GTP pools expand rather than contract. Shrinkage of the purine ribonucleoside triphosphate pools may be sufficient to account for the reduced rate of RNA accumulation during stringency. When the synthesis of ATP and GTP is blocked directly by purine starvation, the rate of RNA accumulation falls drastically with only about a 40% shrinkage of the two pools. Thus net RNA synthesis in vivo is much more sensitive to purine ribonucleoside triphosphate concentration than is RNA polymerase activity in vitro. Shrinkage of the GTP pool alone may be sufficient to account for the response of RNA accumulation to stringency. When GTP synthesis is blocked directly by guanine or guanosine starvation, a moderate decrease in the GTP pool results in a disproportionate reduction in net RNA synthesis. Despite virtually complete inhibition of net RNA synthesis during guanosine starvation, protein synthesis proceeds at about 25% of the normal rate. This suggests that the synthesis and turnover of messenger RNA is much less affected by a moderate decrease in GTP than is the accumulation of stable forms of RNA."

Distinction between growth and passive attachment was made with ultraviolet radiation. In all cases, slides irradiated at intervals had significantly fewer bacteria than controls. Estimated generation times ranged from 2 to 7 hours, values which are comparable to those of aquatic bacteria living in less extreme environments."
https://openalex.org/W1582032388,"Abstract The formation of 1,4-diaminobutane and spermidine from 14C-ornithine and 14C-arginine was studied in an ornithine auxotroph of Escherichia coli W grown in a chemostat. Even under conditions of severe ornithine-arginine restriction, a substantial part of the ornithine or arginine entering the cells (5 to 18%) was used for polyamine biosynthesis. Addition of exogenous 1,4-diaminobutane or spermidine to the culture resulted in a markedly decreased biosynthesis of the polyamines from 14C-ornithine and 14C-arginine. Evidence is presented that these amines can cause both inhibition of ornithine and arginine decarboxylation and partial repression of the formation of ornithine and arginine decarboxylases."

https://openalex.org/W1528860238,"Abstract The rates of synthesis and chain elongation of RNA in stringent (CP 78) and relaxed (CP 79) strains of Escherichia coli have been measured at 27° in the presence and in the absence of a required amino acid. The following observations have been made. 1. Although the rate of uptake of uracil by CP 78 is reduced 200-fold by amino acid starvation, the rate of synthesis of RNA obtained from the specific activity of the intracellular UTP pool is reduced only 9-fold. The rate of synthesis of RNA in CP 79 is unaffected by amino acid deprivation. 2. The number of nascent RNA chains is approximately the same for CP 78 and CP 79, and is unchanged by amino acid starvation. 3. The rates of RNA chain elongation are 23 and 3 nucleotides per sec for unstarved and starved cultures of CP 78, respectively. The rate for CP 79 is virtually unchanged by starvation: 24 and 21 nucleotides per sec for unstarved and starved cultures, respectively. 4. The results are inconsistent with a purely noncoordinate mode of RNA regulation, and suggest that the synthesis of both stable RNA and messenger RNA is restricted, although the relative degree of restriction on the synthetic rates of the two classes cannot be evaluated from these data."
https://openalex.org/W1591943875,"Abstract The arginyl transfer RNA synthetase from Escherichia coli K-12, wild-type, and two arginyl-tRNA synthetase mutant strains, MA 5003 and MA 5005, was purified approximately 200, 140, and 180 times, respectively. Various parameters of these synthetases were measured with the use of the esterification of arginine to transfer RNA as the assay. The mutant enzymes were found to have certain altered properties in common. Both mutant synthetases displayed an increased thermal sensitivity when compared to the wild-type enzyme. The pH optimum for all three enzymes was 8.0, but the activity of the mutant synthetases decreased more rapidly than the activity of the wild-type enzyme as the pH was lowered from 8.0 to 5.5. The Vmax of the mutant synthetases was lower than that of the wild-type enzyme when parameters as the Km values for arginine, ATP, tRNA, and dATP were measured. What differentiated the two mutant synthetases was the observation that the enzyme from strain MA 5003 displayed a 10- to 15-fold increase in Km for arginine, but less than a 2-fold increase in Km for ATP, whereas the arginyl-tRNA synthetase from strain MA 5005 had a 10-fold increase in Km for ATP, but less than a 2-fold increase in Km for arginine compared to the wild-type enzyme. It appears that the mutation in each mutant enzyme independently affects the Km for one substrate, arginine or ATP. When dATP was substituted for ATP, no difference in Km was observed between the wild-type enzyme and the mutant enzyme from strain MA 5005. Lastly the Km for tRNA was the same for all three enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2025591333,Changes in the configurational state of the cristal membranes of rat heart mitochondria within the living cell can be induced by imposing energizing conditions. An exact correlation has been established between the configurational states of the cristal membrane and the energy states of the mitochondrion. The configurational changes observed in mitochondria in situ are comparable to those established for beef heart mitochondria in vitro and are consistent with the postulate of the conformational basis of energy transductions in membrane systems. The formation of paracrystalline arrays is one of the noteworthy features of configurational changes of mitochondria in situ.

https://openalex.org/W1657215464,"Abstract When Escherichia coli 15 TAU is deprived of uracil, the accumulation of RNA abruptly ceases. RNA synthesis, however, continues and is balanced by an equal degradation of RNA. The rate of synthesis of total (messenger and stable) RNA, measured by the incorporation of adenosine, slowly declines during the course of uracil deprivation, attaining a value of 16% of the control after 1 hour. Synthesis of stable RNA, measured as the incorporation of methyl residues into RNA, also slowly declines during uracil starvation and attains a value of 12% after 1 hour. Consequently, the syntheses of message and stable RNA are controlled in an approximately coordinate manner during uracil deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W1484007731,"Relatively large amounts of cell envelopes from Escherichia coli spheroplasts have been isolated in the zonal ultracentrifuge after deoxyribonuclease treatment of the disrupted spheroplasts. The Anderson B-IV zonal rotor was adapted to this isolation. After isopycnic zonal centrifugation through a 34 to 77% sucrose density gradient, the center of the zone containing the cell wall-cell membrane material positions at 58.9% (w/v) sucrose, corresponding to a density of 1.220 g per ml. Such material was further purified by a washing procedure. Electron micrographs indicate that very little material other than envelopes is present in this fraction. The preparation contained fewer than 0.1% intact spheroplasts. The cell envelope fraction contains 6.6 ± 0.3% of the protein, 0.5 ± 0.2% of the DNA, 2.7 ± 0.3% of the RNA, and 92 ± 2% of the phospholipid of the cell. Variable amounts of putrescine and spermidine are found in this fraction. The content of spermidine was particularly high, amounting to 4 to 10% of the cell spermidine. However, the spermidine on the envelopes was shown to be exchangeable during isolation and was not shown to have been a characteristic membrane component. Most of the receptor sites for bacteriophage T6 seem to have been retained on the isolated envelopes. These envelopes contain less than 4% of the diaminopimelic acid of the cell, indicating that most of the material of the rigid layer had been removed."

https://openalex.org/W1568987742,"Abstract The DNA polymerase activity of preparations obtained from Ehrlich ascites cells by hypotonic shock was found to become increasingly dependent upon single strand DNA as promoter during the course of purification. The ability of crude preparations to utilize native DNA to promote synthesis reflected the presence of endonuclease activity. With the use of highly purified preparations the maximum activity was achieved with denatured DNA that had been digested with pancreatic DNase to the extent that 25% of the DNA was rendered acid-soluble. More extensive hydrolysis resulted in drastic inhibition of the reaction. The extent of incorporation, when oligonucleotides were used as promoter, varied widely depending on the molecular sizes of the oligonucleotide. Addition of high molecular weight polymer to low molecular weight polymer was found to enhance promoter activity to levels far greater than those expected by summation of the activities of these promoters used individually. It is concluded that the smaller molecules act as primer but that template function requires a larger size. The polymerase activity of the purified preparation was found to be promoted by oligonucleotides with 5'-phosphoryl and 3'-hydroxyl termini, but inhibited by oligonucleotides with 5'-hydroxyl and 3'-phosphoryl termini. The maximum net increase in DNA attained by the purified enzyme, using denatured DNA, was equivalent to 66% of the DNA used to promote synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1499907694,"Spectrophotometric studies with particles from Mycobacterium phlei have indicated the presence of two carbon monoxide-binding pigments; cytochrome a3 and a second pigment identified as cytochrome o. This identification was made by a comparison of the spectra from M. phlei with that of Escherichia coli, which is known to contain the CO-binding cytochromes, a1, a2, and o. Further identification of cytochrome was o made possible by lipase treatment of the M. phlei particles which released all of the cytochrome o into the supernatant fraction while releasing only small amounts of cytochromes b, c, and a + a3. With this supernatant fraction, the CO-cytochrome o peaks absorbed at 416, 538, and 567 mµ. In the intact particle, the 416 mµ CO-binding peak of cytochrome o was observed whether reduced by succinate, NADH, or malate-FAD which utilize the entire respiratory pathway or by ascorbate-N, N, N′, N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylene diamine which utilizes a segment of the respiratory chain between cytochrome c and oxygen."

https://openalex.org/W1568332246,"Abstract Leucyl transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase (EC 6.1.1.4, l-leucine:tRNA ligase (AMP)) has been purified from Escherichia coli and is free of other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, tRNA-methylating enzymes, and CpCpA-adding enzymes. Several criteria suggest that there is one synthetase with specificity for two forms of leucine-specific tRNA which can be separated by countercurrent distribution:purification studies, the mixed substrate method, and, most conclusively, an enzyme-dependent leucine exchange from countercurrent distribution fractions tRNAileu to tRNAiileu. Leucine exchange from tRNAileu to tRNAiileu occurs in the presence of AMP, magnesium chloride, 12C-leucine, and synthetase. This exchange can best be explained by an AMP-dependent reaction in which leucine is transferred from one kind of tRNA molecule to the other through a leucyl-adenylate-synthetase complex. This exchange implies the existence of a single leucyl-tRNA synthetase which acylates the multiple forms of leucine-tRNA in E. coli."

The results are in accord with the view that the ion-exchange properties of protoplasmic poly-electrolyte determine the overall ionic composition of the cell.
