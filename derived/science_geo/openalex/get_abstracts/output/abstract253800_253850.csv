https://openalex.org/W2139635035,"In decision-making under uncertainty, economic studies emphasize the importance of risk in addition to expected reward. Studies in neuroscience focus on expected reward and learning rather than risk. We combined functional imaging with a simple gambling task to vary expected reward and risk simultaneously and in an uncorrelated manner. Drawing on financial decision theory, we modeled expected reward as mathematical expectation of reward, and risk as reward variance. Activations in dopaminoceptive structures correlated with both mathematical parameters. These activations differentiated spatially and temporally. Temporally, the activation related to expected reward was immediate, while the activation related to risk was delayed. Analyses confirmed that our paradigm minimized confounds from learning, motivation, and salience. These results suggest that the primary task of the dopaminergic system is to convey signals of upcoming stochastic rewards, such as expected reward and risk, beyond its role in learning, motivation, and salience."

https://openalex.org/W1988678841,"Alcanivorax borkumensis is a cosmopolitan marine bacterium that uses oil hydrocarbons as its exclusive source of carbon and energy. Although barely detectable in unpolluted environments, A. borkumensis becomes the dominant microbe in oil-polluted waters. A. borkumensis SK2 has a streamlined genome with a paucity of mobile genetic elements and energy generation–related genes, but with a plethora of genes accounting for its wide hydrocarbon substrate range and efficient oil-degradation capabilities. The genome further specifies systems for scavenging of nutrients, particularly organic and inorganic nitrogen and oligo-elements, biofilm formation at the oil-water interface, biosurfactant production and niche-specific stress responses. The unique combination of these features provides A. borkumensis SK2 with a competitive edge in oil-polluted environments. This genome sequence provides the basis for the future design of strategies to mitigate the ecological damage caused by oil spills."

https://openalex.org/W1986866353,"The manner in which Ca2+-sensitive signaling proteins are activated in contracting cardiomyocytes is an intriguing theoretical problem given that the cytoplasm is continually bathed with systolic Ca2+ concentrations that should maximally activate most Ca2+-sensitive signaling kinases and phosphatases. Store-operated Ca2+ entry, partially attributed to transient receptor potential (TRP) proteins, can mediate activation of the Ca2+-sensitive phosphatase calcineurin in nonexcitable cells. Here we investigated the gain-of-function phenotype associated with TRPC3 expression in the mouse heart using transgenesis to examine the potential role of store-operated Ca2+ entry in regulating cardiac calcineurin activation and ensuing hypertrophy/myopathy. Adult myocytes isolated from TRPC3 transgenic mice showed abundant store-operated Ca2+ entry that was inhibited with SKF96365 but not verapamil or KB-R7943. Associated with this induction in store-operated Ca2+ entry, TRPC3 transgenic mice showed increased calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activation in vivo, cardiomyopathy, and increased hypertrophy after neuroendocrine agonist or pressure overload stimulation. The cardiomyopathic phenotype and increased hypertrophy after pressure overload stimulation were blocked by targeted disruption of the calcineurin Abeta gene. Thus, enhanced store-operated Ca2+ entry in the heart can regulate calcineurin-NFAT signaling in vivo, which could secondarily impact the hypertrophic response and cardiomyopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2062819794,"Translocation of the insulin-regulated glucose transporter GLUT4 to the cell surface is dependent on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. The RabGAP (Rab GTPase-activating protein) AS160 (Akt substrate of 160 kDa) is a direct substrate of Akt and plays an essential role in the regulation of GLUT4 trafficking. We have used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to identify several 14-3-3 isoforms as AS160-interacting proteins. 14-3-3 proteins interact with AS160 in an insulin- and Akt-dependent manner via an Akt phosphorylation site, Thr-642. This correlates with the dominant negative effect of both the AS160T642A and the AS1604P mutants on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Introduction of a constitutive 14-3-3 binding site into AS1604P restored 14-3-3 binding without disrupting AS160-IRAP (insulin-responsive amino peptidase) interaction and reversed the inhibitory effect of AS1604P on GLUT4 translocation. These data show that the insulin-dependent association of 14-3-3 with AS160 plays an important role in GLUT4 trafficking in adipocytes.

Its translocation from intracellular compartments to the cell surface in response to insulin is a multistep process involving intracellular sorting, vesicular transport to the cell surface along cytoskeletal elements, reorganization of cortical actin, and finally docking, priming, and fusion of so-called GLUT4 storage vesicle with the cell surface (1Bryant N.J.

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway has been shown to play an essential role in GLUT4 translocation. One of its many substrates, the Akt substrate of 160 kDa, AS160, contains a Rab GTPase-activating domain, but its cognate in vivo Rab has not yet been identified (5Kane S. Sano H. Liu S.C.H.

There is accumulating evidence in the recent literature that this RabGAP plays an important role in insulin-triggered GLUT4 translocation. Insulin treatment of adipocytes results in phosphorylation of AS160 at six separate sites, and this appears to be mediated by Akt (5Kane S. Sano H. Liu S.C.H. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.C.

Overexpression of an AS160 mutant, in which four of these phosphorylation sites have been mutated to alanines (AS1604P), inhibits insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface in adipocytes. This effect is dependent on an intact RabGAP domain because simultaneous disruption of the putative GAP domain in AS1604P overcame this inhibitory effect on GLUT4 translocation (6Sano H. Kane S.

This observation indicates that the GAP activity of this protein has an important role in GLUT4 trafficking, thus providing one of the first links between signaling and membrane trafficking in this process. More recent evidence suggests that AS160 may inhibit GLUT4 trafficking under basal conditions because knockdown of AS160 using RNA interference resulted in insulin-independent translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface (8Eguez L.

Adding another layer to this model, it has recently been shown that under basal conditions, AS160 binds to GLUT4 storage vesicles, at least in part by a direct interaction with the cytosolic tail of the vesicle cargo protein insulin-responsive amino peptidase (IRAP), and it is released into the cytosol upon insulin stimulation (9Larance M. Ramm G. Stockli J. van Dam E.M. Winata S. Wasinger V. Simpson F. Graham M. Junutula J.R. Guilhaus M. James D.E. J. Biol.

Several Rabs, including Rabs 2A, 8A, 10, 11, and 14, have been found to associate with GLUT4 vesicles (9Larance M. Ramm G. Stockli J. van Dam E.M. Winata S. Wasinger V. Simpson F. Graham M.

AS160 has been shown to display some GTPase activity toward Rabs 2A, 8A, 10, and 14 in vitro (10Miinea C.P. Sano H. Kane S. Sano E. Fukuda M. Peranen J. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. Biochem.

Their major role is facilitated by interacting with phospho-serine or phospho-threonine residues in a variety of proteins, often in response to growth factor stimulation. The interaction of 14-3-3 with target proteins has been shown to encode a variety of functions including subcellular redistribution, altered protein conformation, protection from proteolysis, impaired interaction with other proteins, and scaffolding. In the present study, we describe 14-3-3 as a novel interaction partner for AS160 and provide evidence that this interaction plays an important role in insulin-regulated GLUT4 trafficking. This adds to the list of roles ascribed to 14-3-3 proteins in biological systems.

Trypsin was from Promega (Madison, WI), and complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets were from Roche Applied Science. All other materials were obtained from Sigma. DNA Constructs—Single point mutations were introduced into AS160WT at serine 318 to alanine, serine 341 to alanine, serine 588 to alanine, and threonine 642 to alanine using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The AS1604P-R18 mutant was obtained by annealing, phosphorylating, and then ligating the synthetic oligonucleotide 5′-AATTGGGCAGGCACATGTTGGCCTCCAGGTCCAGCCAGCTCAGGTCGCGGGGCACGCAGTGGGGTG-3′ and its complement twice into the EcoRI site in AS1604P, resulting in the insertion of the peptide sequence NSPHCVPRDLSWLDLEANMCLPNSPHCVPRDLSWLDLEANMCLP into the Asn-719 site. The AS1604P-R18KK construct was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis from AS1604P-R18. Cell Culture and Transfections—3T3-L1 fibroblasts were obtained from Howard Green, cultured, and differentiated into adipocytes as described (9Larance M. Ramm G. Stockli J. van Dam E.M. Winata S.

CHO IR/IRS-1 cells were a gift from Morris White. For transient transfection, a total of 8 μg of DNA (4 μg + 4 μg for cotransfection) was used per 6-cm dish together with 20 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were infected with pBabepuro-HA-GLUT4 retrovirus (16Shewan A.M. van Dam E.M.

After 24 h, infected cells were selected in 2 μg/ml puromycin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and surviving cells were split and differentiated as described above. Adipocytes at day 5-7 after differentiation were electroporated with AS160 constructs as described previously (17Liu J. DeYoung S.M. Hwang J.B. O'Leary E.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36754-36762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and used 24-72 h after electroporation. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—FLAG-AS160-expressing CHO cells or 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h, stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 15 min or preincubated with 100 nm wortmannin for 10 min before the addition of insulin, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed by 10 strokes through a 27-gauge needle in Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 137 mm sodium chloride, 10% glycerol, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture and phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride) at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was incubated with anti-FLAG antibody and protein G beads for 2 h at 4°C.The beads were then washed, and FLAG-AS160 was released from the antibody by incubating for 1 h with 100 μg/ml 3xFLAG peptide (Sigma). For cotransfection of GST-14-3-3 with FLAG-AS160, the lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads, and the beads were washed and eluted with sample buffer. For GST pull downs, lysate from single transfected CHO IR/IRS-1 cells was incubated with either GST alone or GST-14-3-3 and glutathione-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed and boiled in sample buffer. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting was performed according to standard protocols. For the in vivo immunoprecipitation, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated as above but lysed in 1% Triton X-100/60 mm β-octylglucoside (137 mm sodium chloride, 10% glycerol, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, complete protease inhibitor mixture, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride). AS160 was immunoprecipitated from the lysate using 2 μl of AS160 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) and protein A beads for 2 h at 4°C. Mass Spectrometry—Sypro Ruby-stained gel bands were excised, destained for 30 min in 50% acetonitrile and 500 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and dehydrated in 100% acetonitrile for 30 min. The acetonitrile was removed, and the proteins were digested with modified trypsin (12.5 ng/μl) in 100 mm NH4HCO3 overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted by the addition of 5% formic acid for 1 h at room temperature followed by 1 volume of 100% acetonitrile for an additional 1 h and vacuum-desiccated with a SpeediVac. The material was resuspended in 20 μl of 5% formic acid and stored at -20 °C until analyzed. Samples were desalted and subjected to mass spectrometry (with the exception that the strong cation exchange cartridge separation was omitted), and MS/MS data were analyzed as described earlier (9Larance M. Ramm G. Stockli J. van Dam E.M. Winata S. Wasinger V. Simpson F. Graham M. Junutula J.R. Guilhaus M. James D.E. J. Biol.

Immunofluorescence Microscopy—3T3-L1 adipocytes were cultured and electroporated and seeded on glass coverslips. Prior to incubation in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin for 15 min, cells were serum-depleted for 2 h at 37°C. After washing in cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (ProSciTech, Thuringowa Central, Australia) and quenched with 50 mm glycine in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin and labeled for surface HA-GLUT4 as described previously (9Larance M. Ramm G. Stockli J. van Dam E.M. Winata S.

Cells were than washed and permeabilized and labeled with the AS160 antibody to identify the electroporated cells. Primary antibodies were detected with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 and anti-mouse Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies. Optical sections were obtained through separate scans for Alexa Fluor 488 and Cy3 using the Leica TCS SP confocal laser scanning microscope. For quantification of HA, surface staining random images were collected with the same confocal settings, and images were analyzed using the Wright Cell Imaging Facility ImageJ software. Five small ring-shaped regions of interest were placed at equal distances on the edge of the AS160 staining to select the plasma membrane region of cells expressing respective AS160 constructs. The rings were than copied onto the corresponding image of surface HA-Glut4 staining, and the mean fluorescence was measured. Identification of 14-3-3 as an AS160-binding Protein—The Rab GTPase-activating protein AS160 is so far the last known intermediate in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent signal transduction pathway leading to GLUT4 translocation. To further define the role of AS160 in insulin-regulated GLUT4 translocation and possibly find additional proteins involved in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, we sought to identify new AS160 interaction partners. CHO IR/IRS1 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged AS160. Immunoprecipitation of AS160 from basal versus insulin-treated cells revealed a 30-kDa band on SDS-PAGE that associated with AS160 in a partially insulin-dependent manner. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that this band contained two members of the 14-3-3 family, ϵ and θ (Fig. 1A). Three major Sypro Ruby-stained bands were identified in the AS160 immunoprecipitation migrating at a similar position to immunoreactive AS160 (Fig. 1A, asterisks). Each of these bands was identified as AS160 by mass spectrometry, and so it is assumed that they represent degradation products or covalently modified forms of AS160. In addition, antibody IgG was detected by LC-MS/MS at 55 and 25 kDa, respectively. With the exception of 14-3-3, all other bands were below the limit of detection by LC-MS/MS. The interaction between AS160 and 14-3-3 was confirmed with two different approaches involving far Western overlay using GST-14-3-3 β (Fig. 1B) and affinity purification of FLAG-AS160 from CHO cells using GST-14-3-3 β as bait (Fig. 1C). In each experiment, the interaction of AS160 with 14-3-3 was increased upon insulin stimulation. To establish whether there was any 14-3-3 isoform specificity in regard to AS160 binding, we cotransfected GST fusion proteins comprising each of the seven known mammalian 14-3-3 isoforms together with AS160 in CHO IR/IRS-1 cells and performed glutathione pull-downs (Fig. 2A). These studies indicated that all 14-3-3 isoforms interacted with AS160 to a similar extent in vivo, with the exception of the σ isoform, which showed reduced binding. We next attempted to establish the interaction between endogenous 14-3-3 and AS160 in adipocytes. Adipocyte lysates were immunoprecipitated using AS160 antibody. As indicated in Fig. 2B, there was a small amount of 14-3-3 associated with AS160 under basal conditions. However, with insulin, we observed a 4.1 ± 0.8-fold increase in the amount of 14-3-3 associated with AS160. This interaction was wortmannin-sensitive, indicating a role for Akt-dependent phosphorylation. Akt Dependence of 14-3-3 Binding to AS160 and Mapping of the Binding Site to Threonine 642—We next set out to determine whether the 14-3-3/AS160 interaction was Akt-dependent. As shown in Fig. 3A, AS160 underwent an insulin-dependent increase in phosphorylation following expression in CHO IR/IRS1 cells as determined by immunoblotting with the phospho-Akt substrate antibody. Furthermore, we observed an insulin-dependent increase in the association of endogenous 14-3-3 with FLAG-AS160 (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). To determine whether this interaction was mediated by Akt-dependent phosphorylation, we cotransfected CHO IR/IRS-1 cells with FLAG-AS160 together with a constitutively active myristoylated Akt mutant (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). Coexpression of constitutively active Akt resulted in a marked increase in Akt phosphorylation even in cells incubated in the absence of insulin. We also observed a concomitant increase in the association of 14-3-3 with AS160, which occurred in an insulin-independent manner. These studies are consistent with a role for Akt in the insulin-dependent association of AS160 and 14-3-3, pointing to a role for phosphorylation. We next constructed a series of AS160 point mutants (Fig. 3B) to map the 14-3-3 binding site. Point mutations were introduced at the Akt phosphorylation sites in FLAG-AS160 previously described by Lienhard and colleagues (6Sano H. Kane S. Sano E. Miinea C.P. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.W. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14599-14602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) that contained a 14-3-3 binding site. These mutants were expressed in CHO IR/IRS-1 cells and subsequently immunoprecipitated and probed with anti-14-3-3 antibodies. 14-3-3 binding was completely disrupted in mutants lacking the threonine 642 phosphorylation site, whereas mutation of Ser-318, Ser-341, or Ser-588 alone had no effect on 14-3-3 binding. Intriguingly, mutation of the 642 site alone resulted in a loss of binding of the Akt substrate antibody, suggesting that this antibody preferentially recognizes this site. It is unlikely that mutation of the 642 site results in impaired phosphorylation at other sites because we still observe an insulin-dependent molecular weight shift of the AS160T642A mutant following insulin treatment of cells (data not shown). The Interaction of AS160 with 14-3-3 Plays a Functional Role in GLUT4 Translocation—We next wanted to determine whether 14-3-3 plays an important role in the function of AS160 and GLUT4 trafficking. Initially, we showed that overexpression of the AS160T642A mutant in adipocytes inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation consistent with earlier studies by Lienhard and colleagues (6Sano H. Kane S. Sano E. Miinea C.P. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.W. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14599-14602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4D). These data suggest that loss of 14-3-3 binding interferes with insulin regulation of AS160 and GLUT4 translocation. To determine the role of 14-3-3 binding to AS160 independently of other factors such as increased phosphorylation, we engineered a tandem repeat of a high affinity 14-3-3 binding sequence referred to as R18 (18Wang B.C. Yang H.Z. Liu Y.C. Jelinek T. Zhang L.X. Ruoslahti E. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12499-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) into the AS1604P mutant adjacent to the 642 site (AS1604P-R18 mutant, Fig. 4B). As a control, we mutated the 14-3-3 binding site in both R18 sequences from WLDLE to WLKLK (AS1604P-R18KK mutant). Both of these constructs were overexpressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by electroporation and produced proteins of the expected size that were expressed at similar levels to the AS1604P mutant (Fig. 4C). As expected, the AS1604P-R18 showed a significant increase in constitutive 14-3-3 binding, whereas AS1604P-R18KK binding to 14-3-3 was disrupted. To measure the effect of these mutants on GLUT4 translocation, AS160WT, AS1604P, AS1604P-R18, or AS1604P-R18KK constructs were overexpressed in HA-GLUT4-expressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes by electroporation. Surface HA staining was used to monitor GLUT4 translocation. Consistent with previous studies (6Sano H. Kane S. Sano E. Miinea C.P. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.W. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14599-14602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), overexpression of the AS1604P mutant caused a significant inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 4, C and D). Strikingly, introduction of the R18 peptide into AS1604P, thus restoring 14-3-3 binding, completely overcame the inhibitory effect of AS1604P on insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation. Disruption of 14-3-3 binding in the AS1604P-R18KK mutant had a similar effect on GLUT4 translocation as the AS1604P mutant. These data suggest that one of the important functions of AS160 Akt phosphorylation is 14-3-3 binding. However, it is noteworthy that we have introduced the R18 peptide at a site slightly downstream of the natural 14-3-3 binding site at Thr-642. Therefore, we must entertain the possibility that this may result in a 14-3-3-mediated modification that is distinct from that mediated via interaction at Thr-642, although in view of the functional data obtained, this seems unlikely. Notably, overexpression of the AS1604P-R18 mutants in adipocytes was found to be without effect on cell surface GLUT4 levels in the absence of insulin. This illustrates that these mutants are unable to displace the function of endogenous AS160 in the basal state. However, in the presence of insulin, the AS1604P and AS1604P-R18KK mutants may act as dominant negative mutations preventing GLUT4 translocation. This argues in favor of an important role for non-phosphorylated AS160 in retaining the intracellular pool of GLUT4. To establish whether the AS1604P-R18 mutant was still able to interact with the GLUT4 vesicle protein IRAP (9Larance M. Ramm G. Stockli J. van Dam E.M. Winata S. Wasinger V. Simpson F. Graham M. Junutula J.R. Guilhaus M. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37803-37813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), we expressed AS160 mutants in CHO IR/IRS-1 cells and probed their binding to GST-IRAP in vitro (Fig. 4E). All three AS160 mutants showed the same degree of binding to a longer form containing the first 58 amino acids of IRAP as AS160WT. However, none of the mutants interacted with a shorter form of the IRAP cytosolic tail containing only 28 amino acids. In addition, interaction of the AS1604P-R18 mutant with IRAP was not disrupted by the inclusion of recombinant 14-3-3 at a concentration of 1 μm (KD value for R18 peptide for 14-3-3, 70 nm (18Wang B.C. Yang H.Z. Liu Y.C. Jelinek T. Zhang L.X. Ruoslahti E. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12499-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), not shown). The uninterrupted binding of AS1604P-R18 with GST-IRAP suggests that the interaction of 14-3-3 is able to overcome the effects of the 4P mutant on GLUT4 translocation independently of the association of AS160 with GLUT4 vesicles. Collectively, our data show that 14-3-3 plays an important role in insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation via its molecular interaction with AS160. In the present study, we have shown that AS160 interacts with 14-3-3 in an insulin- and Akt-dependent manner and that this interaction plays an important role in insulin-regulated GLUT4 translocation. Most notably, we observed that introduction of a constitutive 14-3-3 binding site into AS160 overcame the inhibitory effects of overexpressing an AS160 Akt phosphorylation mutant on insulin action in adipocytes. These results suggest that the function of AS160 is closely linked to that of 14-3-3. An emerging picture in the literature is that GTPase-activating proteins do not simply play a passive role in switching off GTPases following their activation, but rather, they are intimately involved in the regulatory mechanism that controls their cognate GTPases (19Bernards A. Settleman J. Growth Factors. 2005; 23: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem.

Life Sci. 2005; 62: 3014-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In several other cases, this regulatory switch involves phosphorylation of the GTPase-activating protein, and indeed, 14-3-3 binding has been implicated in some instances (22Benzing T. Kottgen M.

Most notably, Akt-dependent phosphorylation of the tuberin/hamartin complex (TSC1/TSC2) facilitates 14-3-3 binding (25Li Y. Inoki K. Yeung R. Guan K.L. J. Biol.

Members of the regulator of G protein signaling protein family (RGS), such as RGS3 and -7, have also been shown to bind to 14-3-3; however, the role of this interaction in regulating the GAP activity has been controversial (28Benzing T. Yaffe M.B. Arnould T. Sellin L. Schermer B. Schilling B. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. Leparc G.G. Kim E. Walz G. J. Biol.

Previous studies by Lienhard and colleagues (6Sano H. Kane S. Sano E. Miinea C.P. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.W. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14599-14602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) have clearly shown an important role for Akt-mediated phosphorylation of AS160 in GLUT4 trafficking. Expression of an AS160 mutant in adipocytes, in which all four Akt phosphorylation sites were mutated to Ala, resulted in a significant impairment of insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation (6Sano H. Kane S. Sano E. Miinea C.P. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.W. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14599-14602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), and this result has been verified in other studies including the present study (7Zeigerer A. McBrayer M.K. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4406-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 8Eguez L. Lee A. Chavez J.A. Miinea C.P. Kane S. Lienhard G.E. McGraw T.E. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We have been able to overcome the inhibitory effect achieved with this mutant by engineering a constitutive 14-3-3 binding site into the AS1604P mutant. This is not simply due to displacement of AS160 from the GLUT4 vesicle cargo protein IRAP as the AS160-IRAP interaction was maintained even in the constitutive 14-3-3 binding mutant AS1604P-R18. Collectively, these data suggest that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of AS160 and in turn 14-3-3 binding play an essential role in GLUT4 trafficking. The mechanism of AS160 regulation through Akt-mediated 14-3-3 binding may involve release of AS160 from the GLUT4 storage vesicles into the cytosol, prevention of AS160 dephosphorylation and its possible consequent reassociation with GLUT4 storage vesicles, inhibition of the GAP activity of AS160, or prevention of AS160 degradation. Although we cannot exclude the possibility of a role for 14-3-3 binding in regulating the stability of AS160, such a mechanism is unlikely to regulate the rapid release of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane that is observed upon insulin stimulation. A more likely interpretation is that 14-3-3 binding may have a role in regulating the GAP activity of AS160. This may explain why the constitutive 14-3-3 binding peptide R18 was able to reverse the inhibitory effect of the 4P mutant when the 4P-R18 construct was overexpressed in adipocytes. In support of this argument, Lienhard and colleagues (6Sano H. Kane S. Sano E. Miinea C.P. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.W. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14599-14602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the GAP activity of AS160 is an essential feature of its role in insulin-regulated GLUT4 trafficking as disrupting the GAP domain in the 4P mutant (4P-R/K) overcame its inhibitory effects on GLUT4 trafficking. The insulin-dependent binding of 14-3-3 to AS160 could also play an indirect role in the release of AS160 from GLUT4 vesicles (9Larance M. Ramm G. Stockli J. van Dam E.M. Winata S. Wasinger V.

This mechanism could also lead to activation of the Rab that controls GLUT4 exocytosis. Identification of the relevant Rab protein will facilitate the distinction between these various models. Our model predicts that there is one single 14-3-3 binding site in AS160 that is facilitated by interaction at Thr-642. We can, however, not exclude the possibility of an additional 14-3-3 binding site. Notably, we did observe significant binding of 14-3-3 to AS160 under basal conditions in both adipocytes and CHO cells (Figs. 1 and 2). Multiple 14-3-3 binding sites have also been observed in other signaling molecules such as the Ser/Thr kinase Raf (14Wilker E. Yaffe M.B. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2004; 37: 633-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 30Hekman M. Wiese S. Metz R. Albert S. Troppmair J. Nickel J. Sendtner M. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14074-14086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here 14-3-3 has been shown to play a multilayered role in modulating Raf function. Regardless, the sequence surrounding the 642 site in AS160 (RRRAHpTFSHPP), identified here as the major 14-3-3 binding site, fulfills most of the properties of a mode 1 14-3-3 binding site (31Yaffe M.B.

Most of the residues surrounding pT642 are in accordance with the phospho-serine-oriented degenerate peptide library screen with human 14-3-3 tau by Yaffe et al. (31Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S.

(Arg preferred in -3, Phe > Arg ∼ Ser ∼ Ala in -2, Arg > Tyr ∼ Phe ∼ His in -1, and Tyr > Trp ∼ Phe ∼ His in +1.) Other 14-3-3 binding phospho-peptides lacking the proline in the +2 position have been identified, such as the Ser-939 (RARSTpSLNERP) and the Ser-981 (RCRSIpSVSEHV) sites in TSC2 (32Cai S.L. Tee A.R.

The R18 sequence employed in the current study mimics a phosphorylated peptide sequence, and its binding to 14-3-3 occurs in a constitutive insulin-independent manner (18Wang B.C. Yang H.Z. Liu Y.C. Jelinek T. Zhang L.X. Ruoslahti E. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12499-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The discovery of AS160 by Lienhard and colleagues (6Sano H. Kane S. Sano E.

Chem. 2003; 278: 14599-14602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) represented a major advance in the GLUT4 trafficking field as this protein provides a further critical link between signaling downstream of Akt and trafficking. The present identification of 14-3-3 as a regulated binding partner of AS160 now places this protein as a central player in the function of AS160. Although future studies are required to establish whether the interaction of 14-3-3 with AS160 blocks its GAP activity, this can only be achieved once the relevant Rab protein has been identified. Establishing the link between this effect and the regulated association of AS160 with GLUT4 storage vesicles remains another issue that requires further evaluation. Finally, in view of the dimensions of the mammalian RabGAP family comprising as many as 50 members (33Bernards A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1603: 47-82PubMed Google Scholar, 34Bernards A. Settleman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), one wonders whether similar mechanisms to that observed for AS160 have been duplicated in some of these other proteins to achieve similar outcomes for different vesicle transport pathways.

However, the molecular mechanisms through which these compounds induce apoptosis are not well understood. Here we have found that aspirin treatment of the mouse Neuro 2a cells impaired the proteasome function and caused severe mitochondrial abnormalities. Treatment with aspirin lead to a dose- and time-dependent decrease in proteasome activity and an increase in the accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins in the cells, which correlated with its effect on cell death. Aspirin exposure also resulted in an increase in the half-life of pd1EGFP, a model substrate of proteasome, as well as various intracellular substrates like Bax, IκB-α, p53, and p27kip1. Aspirin-induced proteasomal malfunction might be responsible, at least in part, for the down-regulation of NF-κB activity and neurite outgrowth.

The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is the major extra lysosomal pathway of the cells responsible for the intracellular protein degradation in eukaryotes (24Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). A protein to be degraded by this pathway is first covalently attached with multiple molecules of ubiquitin, and then the polyubiquitylated proteins are degraded by the 26 S proteasome. The 26 S proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex, which contains 20 S proteasome as its proteolytic core. The 20 S proteasome has three different types of proteolytic activities. Those are chymotrypsin-like (Tyr or Phe at P1), trypsin-like (Arg or Lys at P1), and post-glutamyl peptidyl hydrolytic-like (Glu at P1) activities. The normal function of UPS is necessary for the cell growth by regulating the cell cycle through timely degradation of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (24Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar, 25Orlowski R.Z. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The proteasome is also associated with many other important functions including degradation of short-lived and misfolded proteins and several transcription factors (24Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Because the UPS is involved in the degradation of many short-lived proteins that are required for cell survival, it is expected that the dysfunction of this pathway will promote cell death. In fact, the pharmacological inhibition of proteasome function has been found to induce the dual apoptotic signaling pathways, depending on the cell types and conditions (26Sadoul R. Fernandez P.A.

In the present investigation, we demonstrate that aspirin inhibits the proteasome function, induces mitochondrial abnormalities, and activates intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Materials—Aspirin, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT), lactacystin, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), MG132, cycloheximide, proteasome and caspase substrates, rabbit polyclonal anti-ubiquitin, mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin, and all cell culture reagents were obtained from Sigma. Lipofectamine 2000 and JC-1 (5,5′, 6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolocarbocyanine iodide) were purchased from Invitrogen and Molecular Probes, respectively. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay kit was purchased from Promega. Mouse monoclonal anti-GFP and anti-HA were from Roche Applied Science; mouse monoclonal anti-cytochrome c and anti-p27kip1 were from Pharmingen; and mouse monoclonal anti-IκB kinase-β (IKKβ), rabbit polyclonal anti-IκB-α, anti-phospho-IκB-α, anti-Bax, and anti-p53 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Goat anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate was purchased from Vector laboratories, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were from Amersham Biosciences. The source of plasmids ubiquitin (with HA tag), pd1EGFP-N1, Hsp70, and Hsp40 are described elsewhere (29Jana N.R. Dikshit P. Goswami A. Nukina N. J. Biol.

Commun. 2006; 342: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). IκB-α-EGFP plasmid was purchased from BD Biosciences. Cell Culture, Treatments, and Viability Assay—Neuro 2a, COS-1, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics. For routine experiments, the cells were plated onto a 6-well tissue culture plate at subconfluent density. After 24 h of plating, cells were treated with different doses of aspirin and MG132 for different time periods and then processed for immunoblotting experiments. For cell viability assay, cells (5 × 103 cells/well) were seeded into 96-well plates, and 24 h after seeding, medium was replaced and cells were treated with different doses of aspirin alone or along with NAC. In some experiments, the cells were plated onto 48-well tissue culture plates. On the following day, cells were transfected with Hsp40 and Hsp70 plasmids. Twenty-four hours later, cells were treated with different doses of aspirin and then processed for cell viability assay. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay and trypan blue dye exclusion method. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Experiment—Twenty-four hours after transfection of pd1EGFP plasmids, cells were treated with different doses of aspirin and MG132 for 8 h. Cells were then washed with cold PBS, scraped, pelleted by centrifugation, and lysed on ice for 30 min with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, complete protease inhibitor mixture). Cell lysates were briefly sonicated, centrifuged for 10 min at 15000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants (total soluble extract) were used for immunoprecipitation. Protein concentration was measured according to the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 78: 248-254Crossref Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). For each immunoprecipitation experiment, 200-μg protein in 0.2 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer was incubated with 5 μl (2.5 μg) of GFP antibody. After overnight incubation at 4 °C with rotation, 20 μl of protein G-agarose beads were added, and incubation was continued at 4 °C for 5 h. The beads were washed six times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads with SDS (1×) sample buffer, vortexed, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by immunoblotting. The total cell lysate or the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated through SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were successively incubated in blocking buffer (5% skim milk in TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween)) with primary antibody in TBST and then with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase in TBST. Detection was carried out with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent. All primary antibodies were used in 1:1000 dilutions for immunoblotting. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Neuro 2a cells were transiently transfected with the IκB-α-EGFP plasmid, and 24 h later the cells were collected and lysed in 400 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 5 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and complete protease inhibitor mixture). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with IKKβ and GFP antibodies. Immune complex was washed twice with buffer A and then equal amounts of immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated with or without different doses of aspirin for 30 min at 4 °C, and in vitro kinase assay was performed at 30 °C for 30 min as described elsewhere (37Kim K.M. Song J.J. An J.Y. Kwon Y.T. Lee Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41047-41056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The samples were then subjected to immunoblotting using phospho-IκB-α and IKKβ antibodies. Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and Cytochrome c Release—Neuro 2a cells were plated onto a 60-mm tissue culture plate at subconfluent density. Twenty-four hours later, cells were exposed to different doses of aspirin and MG132 for 12 h and then incubated with 5 μm JC-1 fluorescence dye for 30 min in the CO2 incubator and washed several times with PBS prewarmed at 37 °C. Mitochondrial membrane potential was evaluated qualitatively under a fluorescence microscope using 568-nm filter. To study the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, Neuro 2a cells grown on chamber slides were treated with different doses of aspirin and MG132. Twelve h after treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, washed extensively and then blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in TBST for 1 h. Primary antibody (anti-cytochrome c) incubation was carried out overnight at 4 °C. After several washings with TBST, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody for 4 h, washed several times, and visualized using a fluorescence microscope. The digital images were assembled using Adobe Photoshop. To evaluate the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria by immunoblotting, Neuro 2a cells were grown on tissue culture dishes, and the cells were then treated with different doses of aspirin for 12 h. The cells were collected by scraping, washed in the PBS followed by sucrose buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride containing 250 mm sucrose), and resuspended in the same buffer. After 1 h of incubation on ice, cells were lysed by Dounce homogenizer of B-type pestle with 30 strokes. Homogenates were centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were recentrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The final supernatants were used for immunoblotting experiments of cytochrome c. Assay of Proteasome, and Caspase-9- and Caspase-3-like Protease Activity—The cells were plated onto a 6-well tissue culture plate, and on the following day, cells were treated with varying doses of aspirin and MG132 for different time periods. Cells were then isolated and processed for proteasome activity assay as described earlier (29Jana N.R. Dikshit P. Goswami A. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11680-11685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The substrates Succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-MCA and benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Glu-MCA were used to determine chymotrypsin and post-glutamyl peptidyl hydrolytic-like activity, respectively. To evaluate the direct effect of aspirin on the protease activity of proteasome, pure 20 S proteasome (250 ng/reaction) was used instead of cell supernatant in the protease activity assay buffer. Protease activities at a particular time point (30 min) within the linear range were used to calculate the data. The fluorescence intensity was measured at 380 nm excitation and 460 nm emissions using a fluorescence plate reader. The caspase-9- and -3-like protease activities were determined as described earlier (32Jana N.R. Zemskov E.A. Wang G. Nukina N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The substrates Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-MCA and Ac-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-MCA were used to determine the caspase-3- and -9-like protease activity, respectively. Cycloheximide-Chase Experiment—Neuro 2a cells were plated onto a 6-well tissue culture plate and on the following day, cells were chased with 15 μg/ml of cycloheximide for different time periods in the presence or absence of aspirin. Cells collected at each time point were then processed for immunoblotting using antibodies against Bax, IκB-α, p53, p27kip1, and β-tubulin. In some experiments, Neuro 2a cells were transiently transfected with pd1EGFP plasmids, and 24 h later, cells were chased with cycloheximide as described above. The collected cells at each time points were then processed for immunoblotting using anti-GFP. Reporter Gene Assay—Neuro 2a cells were plated onto 6-well tissue culture plates at a subconfluent density. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transiently transfected with NF-κB-luciferase and pRL-SV40 plasmids together using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiency was about 80-90%. Twenty-four hours posttransfection, cells were treated with different doses of aspirin and then processed for luciferase assay. Luciferase activity was measured using a dual luciferase reporter assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions. pRL-SV40 plasmid was used for co-transfection to normalize the data, and it was transfected at avery low concentration (150-fold lower than NF-κB luciferase plasmid). The data were represented as relative luciferase activity (the ratio of firefly to Renilla values). Aspirin Inhibits Growth and Induces Apoptosis in Neuro 2a Cells—Aspirin and other NSAIDs have been found to induce apoptosis in many cell types. Here we first tested the effect of aspirin on the viability of mouse Neuro 2a neuroblastoma cells. The cells were plated onto 96-well tissue culture plates, and on the following day, the cells were exposed to the different doses of aspirin for 24 h. The cell viability was determined by MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 1, treatment with aspirin dose dependently reduced the cell viability. Aspirin at a dose of 2.5 mm (the concentration that can be found in the serum of patients treated with aspirin for chronic inflammatory diseases (38Insel P.A. Herman J.G. Molinoff P.B. Rudden R.W. Gilman A.G. The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. McGraw-Hill, New York1996: 617-657Google Scholar)) significantly increased the cell death to about 15 and 35% after 24 and 48 h of exposure, respectively, but how aspirin induced the cell death program was not very clear. NSAIDs have been found to induce the expression of heat shock proteins (Hsps) and generate the oxidative and ER stress (21Tsutsumi S. Gotoh T. Tomisato W. Mima S. Hoshino T. Hwang H.J. Takenaka H. Tsuchiya T. Mori M. Mizushima T. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 22Gao J. Liu X. Rigas B Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17207-17212Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, we presumed that aspirin-induced apoptosis might be because of the induction of stress responses. To test this hypothesis, we checked the role of antioxidant NAC and the overexpression of various heat shock proteins on aspirin-induced cell death. The treatment of NAC dose dependently rescued aspirin-induced cell death (Fig. 1B). Aspirin-induced cell death was also prevented upon overexpression of Hsp70 and Hsp40 chaperones (Fig. 1C). Aspirin Inhibits the Proteasome Function—We next tried to explore the mechanism of aspirin-induced stress responses in the cells. Because the inhibition of proteasomal function induces the stress responses inside the cells, we checked the possible role of aspirin on proteasomal dysfunction. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, dose and time dependently, aspirin treatment of Neuro 2a cells inhibits various protease activities of proteasome. Aspirin exposure at doses of 2.5, 5, and 10 mm for 8 h caused about 25, 40, and 60% inhibition of proteasome activity, respectively. Aspirin also inhibited the proteasome activity in HeLa and COS-1 cells (Fig. 2C). In many experiments, we used 10 mm aspirin to reduce the time of exposure. Because aspirin inhibits the proteasome activity in cell culture, we were further interested to know the possible mechanism of proteasome inhibition. Therefore, we tested the direct effect of aspirin on proteasome activity. The partially purified 20 S proteasome was incubated with varying doses of aspirin in the presence of chymotrypsin-like protease substrate. Fig. 2D shows that aspirin had no effect on the protease activity of the purified 20 S proteasome. Proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin were used as positive controls, and they dramatically decreased the proteasome activity. Thus our results suggest that aspirin-induced proteasomal inhibition is mediated indirectly. To reconfirm the aspirin-induced proteasomal malfunction in cell culture, we checked the ubiquitylation profile because inhibition of proteasome function would lead to the increased accumulation of ubiquitylated derivatives of various proteins. Fig. 3 shows that the exposure to aspirin caused a dose-dependent increase in the accumulation of ubiquitylated derivatives of various cellular proteins. To further confirm the accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins upon aspirin treatment, we transiently transfected Neuro 2a cells with HA-ubiquitin plasmids and then treated them with different doses of aspirin. The blot was detected with HA antibody. In this case, we also detected an increased accumulation of HA-tagged ubiquitylated proteins and a subsequent decrease in the free HA-tagged ubiquitin levels (Fig. 3B). Aspirin Treatment Decreases the Turnover of a Model Substrate of Proteasome—Aspirin-induced proteasomal dysfunction was further confirmed by using destabilized enhanced green fluorescent protein (d1EGFP), a model substrate for proteasome with 1 h of half-life. The pd1EGFP vector contains multiple proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine signal sequence in its C terminus, which can be targeted for degradation by proteasome. The proteasomal malfunction will increase the half-life of this protein. Neuro 2a cells were transiently transfected with the pd1EGFP expression plasmids, and then the cells were chased with cycloheximide in the presence or absence of 10 mm aspirin. Results show that the treatment with 10 mm aspirin increased the half-life of d1EGFP proteins by about 3.5-fold (Fig. 4, A and B). In another experiment, Neuro 2a cells were transiently transfected with pd1EGFP plasmids and then treated with varying doses of aspirin and MG132. The cell lysates were then processed for co-immunoprecipitation experiment using anti-GFP, and the blot was detected sequentially with ubiquitin and GFP antibody. As expected, aspirin treatment, like MG132, resulted in increased accumulations of ubiquitylated d1EGFP proteins (Fig. 4C). Exposure to Aspirin Increases the Half-life of Various Cellular Substrates of Proteasome—Because aspirin increases the half-life of a model substrate of proteasome, we next tested its effect on the half-life of other cellular target substrates. First, we checked the effect of aspirin on the accumulations and degradations of IκB-α and the down-regulation of NF-κB activity. As shown in Fig. 5, A-C, the treatment with aspirin caused a dose-dependent increase in accumulation and increased half-life of IκB-α. This increased half-life of IκB-α might be involved, at least in part, in the down-regulation of the NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity (Fig. 5D). Aspirin-induced increased accumulation of IκB-α is not only observed in Neuro 2a cells but also can be detected in COS-1 and HeLa cells (Fig. 5E). Aspirin at a dose of 5 mm caused about 3-fold increase in the accumulation of IκB-α in COS-1 and HeLa cel"

https://openalex.org/W2158402820,"Cellular prion protein (PrPc) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored membrane protein that is highly conserved in mammalian species. PrPc has the characteristics of adhesive molecules and is thought to play a role in cell adhesion and membrane signaling. Here we investigated the possible role of PrPc in the process of invasiveness and metastasis in gastric cancers. PrPc was found to be highly expressed in metastatic gastric cancers compared to nonmetastatic ones by immunohistochemical staining. PrPc significantly promoted the adhesive, invasive, and in vivo metastatic abilities of gastric cancer cell lines SGC7901 and MKN45. PrPc also increased promoter activity and the expression of MMP11 by activating phosphorylated ErK1/2 in gastric cancer cells. MEK inhibitor PD98059 and MMP11 antibody (Ab) significantly inhibited in vitro invasive and in vivo metastatic abilities induced by PrPc. N-terminal fragment (amino acid 24-90) was suggested to be an indispensable region for signal transduction and invasion-promoting function of PrPc. Taken together, the present work revealed a novel function of PrPc that the existence of N-terminal region of PrPc could promote the invasive and metastatic abilities of gastric cancer cells at least partially through activation of MEK/ERK pathway and consequent transactivation of MMP11."

https://openalex.org/W2042830971,"We had previously defined by allele loss studies a minimal region at 6q27 (between D6S264 and D6S297) to contain a putative tumour suppressor gene. The p90 ribosomal S6 kinase-3 gene (p90 Rsk-3, RPS6KA2) maps in this interval. It is a serine–threonine kinase that signals downstream of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. It is expressed in normal ovarian epithelium, whereas reduced or absent in tumours or cell lines. We show that RPS6KA2 is monoallelically expressed in the ovary suggesting that loss of a single expressed allele is sufficient to cause complete loss of expression in cancer cells. Further, we have identified two new isoforms of RPS6KA2 with an alternative start codon. Homozygous deletions were identified within the RPS6KA2 gene in two cell lines. Re-expression of RPS6KA2 in ovarian cancer cell lines suppressed colony formation. In UCI101 cells, the expression of RPS6KA2 reduced proliferation, caused G1 arrest, increased apoptosis, reduced levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase and altered other cell cycle proteins. In contrast, small interfering RNA against RPS6KA2 showed the opposite effect in 41M cells. The above results suggest that RPS6KA2 is a putative tumour suppressor gene to explain allele loss at 6q27."
https://openalex.org/W2047558196,"The antimicrobial activity of amphipathic α-helical peptides is usually attributed to the formation of pores in bacterial membranes, but direct structural information about such a membrane-bound state is sparse. Solid state 2H-NMR has previously shown that the antimicrobial peptide PGLa undergoes a concentration-dependent realignment from a surface-bound S-state to a tilted T-state. The corresponding change in helix tilt angle from 98 to 125° was interpreted as the formation of PGLa/magainin heterodimers residing on the bilayer surface. Under no conditions so far, has an upright membrane-inserted I-state been observed in which a transmembrane helix alignment would be expected. Here, we have demonstrated that PGLa is able to assume such an I-state in a 1:1 mixture with magainin 2 at a peptide-to-lipid ratio as low as 1:100 in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine/dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol model membranes. This 2H-NMR analysis is based on seven orientational constraints from Ala-3,3,3-d3 substituted in a non-perturbing manner for four native Ala residues as well as two Ile and one Gly. The observed helix tilt of 158° is rationalized by the formation of heterodimers. This structurally synergistic effect between the two related peptides from the skin of Xenopus laevis correlates very well with their known functional synergistic mode of action.

Acta. 1998; 1376: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar and 9Matsuzaki K. Sugishita K. Miyajima K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar for reviews). Both peptides occur in the same biological tissue, and several studies have demonstrated synergistic effects in their antimicrobial action. For example, the membrane potential decreases when either PGLa or MAG is added to bacteria, and a greatly enhanced effect is observed for mixtures (10Juretic D. Stud. Biophys. 1990; 138: 79-86Google Scholar). Likewise, liposome leakage induced by MAG was found to increase 25–40- fold in the presence of a small amount of PGLa (11Williams R.W. Starman R. Taylor K.M. Gable K. Beeler T. Zasloff M. Covell D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4490-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Synergism has also been demonstrated in studies of respiration in spermatozoa (12De Waal A. Vaz Gomes A. Mensink A. Grootegoed J.A. Westerhoff H.V. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and membrane permeability (13Vaz Gomes A. De Waal A. Berden J.A. Westerhoff H.V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5365-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) for 1:1 mixtures of PGLa and MAG. A functional study on anti-tumor effects, membrane leakage, and glucose permeability of several mixtures with different ratios shows that the 1:1 mixture is the most potent, suggesting heterodimer formation (14Westerhoff H.V. Zasloff M. Rosner J.L. Hendler R.W. De Waal A. Vaz Gomes A. Jongsma A.P.M. Riethorst A. Juretic D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Structure analysis by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy suggests dimerization via specific interactions between the two peptides, as amino acid mutations change their mutual affinity (15Matsuzaki K. Mitani Y. Akada K.Y. Murase O. Yoneyama S. Zasloff M. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15144-15153Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). A cross-linking study shows that heterodimers are formed in a parallel fashion, and the cross-linked peptides are more efficient in inducing vesicle leakage (16Hara T. Mitani Y. Tanaka K. Uematsu N. Takakura A. Tachi T. Kodama H. Kondo M. Mori H. Otaka A. Nobutaka F. Matsuzaki K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12395-12399Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the present analysis, we used solid-state NMR to determine the molecular alignment of PGLa in lipid bilayers in the presence of MAG. In determining whether PGLa has a preference for forming heterodimers with MAG rather than homodimers, we expected to see structural differences compared with its usual behavior, which we had characterized in detail previously (17Strandberg E.

The amino acid sequences (see Table 1) suggest that both peptides form amphiphilic α-helices, with charged and polar side chains on one face and hydrophobic residues on the other (see helical wheels in Fig. 1). For PGLa, the α-helical conformation is confirmed by circular dichroism in the presence of lipid vesicles (15Matsuzaki K. Mitani Y. Akada K.Y. Murase O. Yoneyama S. Zasloff M. Miyajima K.

Open table in a new tab Solid-state NMR is a powerful tool in resolving the structure and alignment of membrane-active peptides in lipid bilayers (3Strandberg E. Ulrich A.S.

For simple α-helical peptides, it is straightforward to collect a number of orientational constraints from which the molecular conformation can be verified and its membrane alignment and dynamic behavior deduced (26Ulrich A.S. Wadhwani P. Dürr U.H.N. Afonin S. Glaser R.W. Strandberg E. Tremouilhac P. Sachse C. Berditchevskaia M. Grage S.L. Boca Raton FL Ramamoorthy A NMR Spectroscopy of Biological Solids. CRC Press, 2006: 215-236Google Scholar). For each NMR constraint, a selective isotope label has to be placed into a suitable position on the peptide. Non-perturbing 15N isotopes are conveniently incorporated into the backbone and 2H-labels into the side chains. Alanine-3,3,3-d3 (Ala-d3) is highly suitable, because the deuterated methyl group is attached directly to the backbone and reflects the orientation of the entire peptide segment (27Van der Wel P.C.A.

Previous 15N-NMR studies of PGLa have shown that the helix axis is aligned roughly parallel to the membrane surface (20Glaser R.W. Sachse C. Dürr U.H.N. Wadhwani P. Ulrich A.S. J. Magn.

Analogous studies on MAG have also revealed a flat S-state in various lipid systems up to a peptide-to-lipid molar ratio (P/L) of 1:25 (29Marassi F.M. Ma C. Gesell J.J. Opella S.J. Appl. Magn.

For our more recent 2H-NMR studies, we have placed selective Ala-d3 labels into PGLa and measured its alignment more accurately in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and in mixed DMPC/DMPG (dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol) bilayers. A slight but significant concentration-dependent realignment of the helix axis in the membrane has been observed (17Strandberg E. Wadhwani P. Tremouilhac P. Dürr U.H.N. Ulrich A.S. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 1676-1686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Tremouilhac P. Strandberg E. Wadhwani P. Ulrich A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The same realignment has also been characterized by 19F-NMR studies of 19F-labeled PGLa (19Glaser R.W. Ulrich A.S. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 164: 104-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Glaser R.W. Sachse C. Dürr U.H.N. Wadhwani P. Ulrich A.S. J. Magn.

At low peptide concentration, the helix axis was found to lie almost flat on the membrane surface in the so-called S-state at an angle of 98° with respect to the membrane normal. At high peptide concentration, an obliquely tilted T-state was discovered and characterized for the first time. The helices were tilted by ∼125° in this putative antiparallel homodimer. We did not, however, observe any upright transmembrane orientation that would be expected for an inserted I-state (where the tilt angle would be near 0 or 180°), which is proposed in the Matsuzaki-Shai-Huang model of antimicrobial activity (8Matsuzaki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 33Shai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar, 34Huang H.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8347-8352Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In the I-state, the peptides are supposed to form transmembrane pores, which induce cell leakage and thereby kill bacteria. Such pores have been observed by neutron diffraction for MAG in the DMPC/DMPG (3:1) system (35Yang L. Weiss T.M. Lehrer R.I. Huang H.W. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2002-2009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), where the peptide was proposed to be in the I-state. In the present study, Ala-d3-labeled PGLa was reconstituted with MAG at a 1:1 molar ratio into DMPC/DMPG model membranes. A solid-state 2H-NMR structure analysis was performed to determine the orientation of PGLa in the presence of MAG to examine the possible formation and structural behavior of synergistically active heterodimers. Peptide Synthesis—PGLa was labeled at eight different positions, one at a time, replacing Ala, Gly, or Ile with Ala-d3 (see Table 1). MAG was prepared without isotope labels. All peptides were chemically synthesized and purified as described previously (17Strandberg E. Wadhwani P. Tremouilhac P. Dürr U.H.N. Ulrich A.S. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 1676-1686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Tremouilhac P. Strandberg E. Wadhwani P. Ulrich A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of the products was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and analytical high pressure liquid chromatography showed them to be at least 95% pure. Sample Preparation—DMPC and DMPG were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Macroscopically oriented membranes on glass plates were prepared as previously described (17Strandberg E. Wadhwani P. Tremouilhac P. Dürr U.H.N. Ulrich A.S. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 1676-1686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Tremouilhac P. Strandberg E. Wadhwani P. Ulrich A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Appropriate amounts of peptides and lipids were co-dissolved in ∼400 μl of methanol/CHCl3 (1:1 v/v) and spread onto 20 thin glass plates of dimensions 18 × 7.5 × 0.08 mm3 (Marienfeld Laboratory Glassware, Lauda-Königshofen, Germany). The plates were dried in air for 1 h followed by drying under vacuum overnight. They were then stacked and hydrated using deuterium-depleted water at 96% relative humidity at 48 °C for 24–48 h. NMR Spectroscopy—All solid-state NMR measurements were carried out on Bruker Avance 500- or 600-MHz spectrometers at 308 K. 31P- and 2H-NMR experiments were performed as previously described (17Strandberg E.

Choice of Peptide-Lipid System—For PGLa in DMPC bilayers, we have found previously that the peptide binds in a monomeric S-state at P/L ≤ 1:200, whereas at P/L ≥ 1:50, a homodimeric T-state is characterized in oriented NMR samples (17Strandberg E. Wadhwani P. Tremouilhac P. Dürr U.H.N. Ulrich A.S. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 1676-1686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21Glaser R.W. Sachse C. Dürr U.H.N. Afonin S. Wadhwani P. Strandberg E. Ulrich A.S. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 3392-3397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In a negatively charged lipid mixture of DMPC/DMPG (3:1), the same realignment of PGLa was observed as in zwitterionic DMPC, although the T-state was reached at a somewhat lower peptide concentration. The exact threshold concentration depends on the affinity of the cationic peptide to the lipids and on the presence of excess water in the sample (18Tremouilhac P. Strandberg E. Wadhwani P. Ulrich A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in the present study, a PGLa/MAG/DMPC/DMPC (1:1:75:25) system was used to prepare oriented NMR samples (containing no excess water). This composition corresponds to a total P/L of 1:50, as the individual peptides contribute with a P/L of 1:100 each. PGLa alone has been shown to exist in the T-state both at P/L = 1:50 and 1:100 in both DMPC and DMPC/DMPG (3:1), which implies that PGLa forms stable homodimers under all these conditions (18Tremouilhac P. Strandberg E. Wadhwani P. Ulrich A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). 31P-NMR Quality Check—The oriented membrane samples were examined by 31P-NMR and found to form a well oriented lamellar phase (Fig. 2A). A simulation of the spectrum was performed with the program DMFit (37Massiot D. Fayon F. Capron M. King I. Le Calve S. Alonso B. Durand J.O. Bujoli B. Gan Z.H. Hoatson G. Magn. Reson. Chem. 2002; 40: 70-76Crossref Scopus (3311) Google Scholar), and it was found that ∼80% of the signal came from oriented parts, with a ratio of 3:1 from DMPC and DMPG, respectively, and 20% of the signal coming from unoriented parts of the sample. Thus, no enrichment of either lipid was found in the unoriented part. No non-lamellar or narrowed signals were observed. 2H-NMR Analysis—The 2H-NMR spectra of PGLa/MAG/DMPC/DMPG (1:1:75:25) with PGLa labeled at eight different positions with Ala-d3 are shown in Fig. 2B. The respective 2H quadrupole splittings are listed in Table 1. Because the splittings for any one label are different in the PGLa and PGLa/MAG samples, this clearly indicates a different alignment of PGLa in the lipid bilayer when MAG is present, suggesting that heterodimers are formed. To calculate the alignment of PGLa in the heterodimer from the NMR data of Fig. 2B, we note that a helical peptide in the membrane can be generally described by three parameters: the tilt angle τ of the helix axis with respect to the bilayer normal, the azimuthal rotation angle ρ around the helix axis, and the molecular order parameter Smol (3Strandberg E.

Given that the effective (time-averaged) quadrupole tensor is collinear with the C–CD3 axis in the molecular frame of PGLa, at least three orientational constraints are required to calculate the three parameters τ, ρ, and Smol. In practice, more than three are needed, as the sign of a quadrupole splitting is not accessible, which leads to multiple solutions (39Ulrich A.S. Heyn M.P. Watts A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10390-10399Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A previous study indicates that at least four labeled positions are required to obtain a reliable structure (28Strandberg E. Özdirekcan S. Rijkers D.T.S. Van der Wel P.C.A. Koeppe II, R.E. Liskamp R.M.J. Killian J.A. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3709-3721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To perform this kind of analysis, the secondary structure of the peptide in the lipid bilayer has to be known. PGLa has been previously shown by circular dichroism and 1H-NMR to form an α-helix in the region between residues 6–21 (15Matsuzaki K. Mitani Y. Akada K.Y. Murase O. Yoneyama S. Zasloff M.

We therefore used an ideal poly(alanine) α-helix as a model structure for PGLa, and this model was fitted to the experimental 2H-NMR data of the peptide. In a grid search for the best-fit structure, the theoretical quadrupole splittings were systematically calculated for all combinations of τ, ρ, and Smol (17Strandberg E. Wadhwani P. Tremouilhac P.

The parameters τ and ρ were changed in steps of 1° and Smol in steps of 0.01 to find the lowest root mean square deviation with regard to the experimental data. The results were then displayed in a quadrupolar wave plot to assess the deviations of the individual data points and in a two-dimensional τ-ρ map to check whether there were any further local minima present. PGLa Alignment in the Presence of MAG—A substitution of Ala by Ala-d3 is entirely non-perturbing and does not affect the molecular behavior of wild-type PGLa. When any other amino acid (in this case a single Gly or Ile) is replaced by Ala-d3, such a mutation might change the properties of the peptide. Therefore, the 2H-NMR data analysis was first performed by taking into account only those four orientational constraints from the non-perturbed native Ala positions in the sequence, i.e. using the quadrupole splittings of Ala-6, -8, -10, and -14. That way, we found a helix tilt angle of τ = 158° for PGLa in the 1:1 mixture with MAG, corresponding to an almost upright transmembrane alignment of the peptide. The best-fit parameters are listed in Table 2, and a quadrupolar wave plot is shown in Fig. 3A, (solid line). In this representation, the hypothetical quadrupole splittings are calculated for each position around the helical wheel and displayed on a curve from 0 to 360°. For comparison, we recall that the tilt angle of PGLa alone in an analogous DMPC/DMPG system had been previously determined to be ∼125° with respect to the membrane normal (18Tremouilhac P. Strandberg E. Wadhwani P. Ulrich A.S. Biochim. Biophys.

Open table in a new tab To verify and strengthen this result, additional Ala-d3 labels were included in the structure analysis, replacing either Gly-7, Ile-9, or Ile-13. The combined fit over seven data points, including these three labels, gave almost the same best-fit values in τ, ρ, and Smol (Table 2; Fig. 3A, dashed curve). None of the seven experimental data points deviated significantly from the quadrupolar wave that was generated from the ideal α-helix, thus confirming that the labeled stretch is consistent over its full length with a non-perturbed α-helical conformation. A deviation was only noted for yet another labeled position, where Gly-11 was replaced by Ala-d3, as this splitting was inconsistent with the remaining data (Fig. 3A). When this data point was included in the mathematical data analysis, virtually the same tilt angle was calculated, but with a high Smol and a very high root mean square deviation (Table 2). The quality and uniqueness of the fitted solution could be assessed using two-dimensional τ-ρ error plots. Fig. 3B shows the error plot for the fit using only the four native Ala-d3 labels. The root mean square deviation (in kHz) is illustrated by a gradient gray scale for all combinations of τ and ρ. There exist several minima with a root mean square deviation <2.0 kHz, as the signs of the quadrupole splittings are not known, but the solution with a tilt angle of τ = 158° is clearly the best fit (ρ = 93°, Smol = 0.84). The corresponding quadrupolar wave in Fig. 3A, solid line, represents the non-perturbed peptide structure. When the data from Gly-7, Ile-9, and Ile-13 are included (Fig. 3A, dashed line), the error plot in Fig. 3C then shows only one distinct minimum, proving that this is the unique solution. In this solid-state 2H-NMR study, we have labeled PGLa selectively with Ala-d3 and determined the orientation of this antimicrobial peptide in a lipid bilayer in the presence of MAG. Besides placing the labels into native Ala positions, in some cases, Ala-d3 was also used to replace an Ile or Gly residue. Antimicrobial tests performed on these mutated peptides showed that they all have the same activity as wild-type PGLa within a factor of two, and all of the mutants also showed synergistic effects when mixed with MAG. 3P. Tremouilhac, D. Tiltak, E. Strandberg, P. Wadhwani, and A. S. Ulrich, unpublished results. To be sure to avoid any potential conformational artifacts induced by the mutations, in the first round of the data analysis, we used only the non-perturbed peptides, and we then refined the analysis by including the mutants. In the following discussion, we will first compare the observed alignment of PGLa with and without MAG. Thereafter, we will discuss the possibility that toroidal wormhole pores are formed in the membrane. Finally, we will examine the possible role of specific interactions between PGLa and MAG. Previous studies of PGLa in different lipid systems (DMPC and DMPC/DMPG) over a wide range of concentrations from P/L = 1:200 to P/L = 1:20 always reveal an S-state or a T-state alignment or a fast averaging between the two (17Strandberg E.

The S-state is attributed to monomeric peptides lying virtually flat on the membrane surface and rotating fast around the membrane normal with the lysine side chains pointing toward the water phase (17Strandberg E.

The T-state, observed at a higher peptide concentration, exhibits a tilt angle of ∼125°, and the charged amino acids also point toward the aqueous phase (17Strandberg E. Wadhwani P. Tremouilhac P.

This alignment corresponds to a helix inclination of ∼35° relative to the membrane plane, with the C terminus penetrating more deeply than the N terminus. The T-state is proposed to represent antiparallel homodimers engaged in fast rotation around the membrane normal. It corresponds to a distinct and stable state, presumably because of a specific packing of the two PGLa helices. Under certain conditions, the T-state has been observed to exist in fast exchange with the S-state (18Tremouilhac P. Strandberg E. Wadhwani P. Ulrich A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, Ala-d3-labeled PGLa was mixed with unlabeled MAG at a 1:1 molar ratio, and the splittings from 2H-NMR were analyzed. In the presence of MAG, we discovered a distinctly different helix tilt angle for PGLa of ∼158°. This nearly upright alignment of PGLa suggests a membrane-inserted I-state, which has been postulated to be responsible for antimicrobial action (8Matsuzaki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 33Shai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar, 34Huang H.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8347-8352Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). A formation of membrane-inserted complexes would explain the observation that PGLa/MAG mixtures are less sensitive to proteases than either peptide alone (14Westerhoff H.V. Zasloff M. Rosner J.L. Hendler R.W. De Waal A. Vaz Gomes A. Jongsma A.P.M. Riethorst A. Juretic D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The functional synergism with a maximum effect at a 1:1 molar ratio observed in previous studies (12De Waal A. Vaz Gomes A. Mensink A. Grootegoed J.A. Westerhoff H.V. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Vaz Gomes A. De Waal A. Berden J.A. Westerhoff H.V.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15144-15153Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) also supports our interpretation that PGLa/MAG heterodimers are present in the NMR sample. The corresponding tilt angle of 158° would give PGLa an effective length across the membrane of ∼21 × 1.5 × cos(158°) Å = 29.2 Å, assuming that the 21-residue peptide forms an α-helix with a 1.5-Å step distance/residue. This length is enough to span the DMPC/DMPG bilayer, assuming a hydrophobic thickness of ∼26 Å, close to that of pure DMPC (40Nagle J.F. Tristram-Nagle S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 159-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2229) Google Scholar). In a transmembrane alignment, the amphipathic PGLa/MAG dimers are expected to assemble further to avoid any contact of the charged amino acids with the hydrophobic bilayer interior. Because the 31P-NMR spectra showed that all of the lipids were in a lamellar phase, the formation of small or non-lamellar aggregates can be excluded. Therefore, the heterodimers presumably assemble into larger transmembrane pores in which the charged residues line the water-filled channel, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 4. For PGLa/MAG, a higher order parameter (Smol = 0.8) was found than for PGLa alone (Smol = 0.7). This reduced wobble of PGLa/MAG also supports the formation of larger assemblies. We also observed that the usual long-axial rotation of PGLa around the bilayer normal ceases in the presence of MAG. This was deduced from measurements of the oriented NMR sample at a 90° inclination with respect to the static magnetic field. Transmembrane pores have been previously observed for MAG using neutron diffraction (41Ludtke S.J. He K. Heller W.T. Harroun T.A. Yang L. Huang H.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13723-13728Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), and a toroidal wormhole model has been proposed (8Matsuzaki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The pore was postulated to be lined by both negatively charged lipid headgroups as well as cationic peptides, as opposed to the barrel-stave model in which only peptides line the pore. Such wormholes have also been proposed for PGLa alone, but so far no direct evidence has been presented. 31P-NMR line shapes can provide some information about the lipid behavior and morphology. Our spectra are similar to those reported in the presence of the antimicrobial peptide MSI-78, for which wormhole formation has been proposed (42Hallock K.J. Lee D.K. Ramamoorthy A. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 3052-3060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Having attributed the synergistic action of PGLa/MAG to the formation of stable transmembrane pores, we still need to explain the lower but yet considerable activity of PGLa alone, which was always found to remain surface-bound in our NMR analysis. One possibility is that the homodimers of PGLa with a shallow tilt angle preferentially float on the membrane surface but occasionally assemble further to form a short-lived pore in the I-state. When MAG is added, heterodimers form instead, for which the corresponding pores are more stable and sufficiently long-lived to be observed by NMR (see Fig. 4). A likely factor contributing to their stability could be the reduced electrostatic repulsion of MAG (+3 to +4) compared with PGLa (+5). Indeed, Matsuzaki et al. (15Matsuzaki K. Mitani Y. Akada K.Y. Murase O. Yoneyama S. Zasloff M. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15144-15153Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) have demonstrated by fluorescence quenching that the lifetime of pores follows the order of PGLa > PGLa/MAG > PGLa (15Matsuzaki K. Mitani Y. Akada K.Y. Murase O. Yoneyama S. Zasloff M. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15144-15153Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Concerning the specific interaction between PGLa and MAG, we speculate that the heterodimers are stabilized by salt bridges between the negatively charged Glu-19 of MAG and one of the lysines of PGLa, most likely Lys-19 or Lys-5, for the case of parallel and antiparallel dimers, respectively. A cross-linking study, where Cys residues had been added to the termini of the peptides in a systematic way, shows that heterodimers form in lipid membranes in a parallel fashion (16Hara T. Mitani Y. Tanaka K. Uematsu N. Takakura A. Tachi T. Kodama H. Kondo M. Mori H. Otaka A. Nobutaka F. Matsuzaki K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12395-12399Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which suggests the formation of parallel dimers. We also note that the 2H quadrupole splitting of Ala-d3 substituted for position Gly-11 in PGLa did not fit with the other seven data points. This deviation may be attributed to a specific interaction between PGLa and MAG at this position, which gets perturbed in the Gly→Ala mutant. Gly-Gly interactions have indeed been shown to be important for dimerization in other membrane-associated peptides and proteins (43Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). We are grateful to Olaf Zwernemann, Silvia Gehrlein and Stephanie Maurer at the Institute for Biological Interfaces at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe for their help with synthesis and purification of PGLa and MAG."

The removal from blood of endogenous and xenobiotic cholephilic organic anions, such as bile acids, bilirubin, and steroid hormones, is a major function carried out by the liver. The vectorial transport of these compounds by hepatocytes includes uptake across the basolateral plasma membrane and subsequent secretion into bile across the canalicular plasma membrane. Because for most of these substances simple diffusion plays a minor role in both processes, the overall system depends on the polarized expression of transport proteins (1Kullak-Ublick G.A. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 322-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (gene symbol SLC10A1) mediates efficient sodium-dependent bile acid uptake across the basolateral plasma membrane (2Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Foguet M.

Together with carriers belonging to the SLC22A gene family, such as organic anion transporters (3Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. Semin.

Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 447: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). OATPs exhibit broad substrate specificity, including conjugated and unconjugated bile acids, bilirubin, thyroid hormones, anionic peptides, and numerous drugs (5Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1609: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 6Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 447: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Three OATP isoforms with the ability to transport bile acids are expressed in human liver, namely OATP-A/1A2 (gene symbol SLCO1A2), OATP-C/1B1 (SLCO1B1), and OATP8/1B3 (SLCO1B3). The role of OATP-A/1A2 in bile acid uptake by hepatocytes is probably minor as compared with other OATPs because of its low expression in these cells (7Kullak-Ublick G.A. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B.

In contrast, based on its broad specificity, high expression level, and localization at the hepatocyte basolateral plasma membrane, OATP-C/1B1 probably plays a major role in the hepatic uptake of organic anions (9König J. Cui Y. Nies A.T. Keppler D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G156-G164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). OATP8/1B3 is also expressed at the same domain of the hepatocyte plasma membrane (10König J. Cui Y. Niesm A.T. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23161-23168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) and exhibits similar broad substrate specificity to that of OATP-C/1B1 (11Kullak-Ublick G.A.

Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 525-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), which suggests that this transporter could contribute to transporting organic anions in the liver as well as in other epithelial cells expressing it (8Briz O. Serrano M.A. Macias R.I.R. Gonzalez-Gallego J. Marin J.J.G. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The driving forces accounting for OATP-mediated transport are not yet well known (12Ballatori N. Hammond C.L. Cunningham J.B. Krance S.M. Marchan R. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2005; 204: 238-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Rat Oatp1/1a1-mediated transport has been reported to occur through pH-dependent and electro-neutral anion exchange, in which the uptake of organic anions is coupled to the efflux of bicarbonate (13Satlin L.M. Amin V. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26340-26345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, the ability of reduced glutathione (GSH) to participate in exchange with organic anions across this antiporter has been also suggested (14Li L. Lee T.K. Meier P.J. Ballatori N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16184-16191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The efflux of intracellular GSH or glutathione S-conjugates also seems to be able to account for the driving force involved in rat Oatp2/1a4-mediated substrate uptake (15Li L. Meier P.J. Ballatori N. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the organic substrate transport carried out by Oatp1/1a1 and Oatp2/1a4 can be potentially bidirectional (15Li L. Meier P.J. Ballatori N. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 16Shi X. Bai S. Ford A.C. Burk R.D. Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25591-25595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which implies that the overall directionality of the net transport is dependent on substrate gradients across the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes. Studies carried out with human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells have indicated that the uptake and extrusion of cholephilic organic anions are modulated by intracellular GSH (17Lee T.K. Hammond C.L. Ballatori N. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2001; 174: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) but not by proton gradients (18Marin J.J.G. Mangas D. Martinez-Diez M.C. El-Mir M.Y. Briz O. Serrano M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1611: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In contrast, OATP-B/2B1 is a pH-sensitive transporter that does not transport GSH and is not activated by the outwardly directed GSH gradient (19Nozawa T. Imai K. Nezu J.I. Tsuji A. Tamai I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 308: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Whether other human members of the OATP family may work as anion exchangers or GSH-mediated transporters remains to be elucidated. In preliminary experiments, we unexpectedly found evidence that OATP8/1B3 could behave as a GSH-dependent symporter. Accordingly, we wondered whether this could play a role in cis-activating bile acid transport and, if so, what the functional meaning of this mechanism of action would be. Under physiological circumstances, several ATP-binding cassette proteins export cholephilic organic anions into bile across the canalicular plasma membrane of hepatocytes, whereas other ATP-binding cassette proteins, such as the isoforms 1, 3, and 4 of the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), are up-regulated in response to cholestasis and become a route for the extrusion of cholephilic organic anions across the basolateral membrane (for review see Ref. 20Marin J.J.G. Romero M.R. Vallejo M. Perez M.J. Briz O. Med. Hypotheses Res. 2005; 2: 425-448Google Scholar). This may limit the accumulation in hepatocytes of potentially toxic compounds. Therefore, another goal of this study was to investigate whether OATPs, in particular OATP8/1B3, may contribute to this function. Radiolabeled substrates were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (ITISA Biomedica, Madrid, Spain) or PerkinElmer Life Sciences, except 22,23-3H-labeled bile acids, [3H]taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA; 0.37 TBq/mmol), [3H]taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA; 1.11 TBq/mmol), and [3H]tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA; 0.37 TBq/mmol), which were prepared by reductive tritiation of their corresponding Δ22,23 precursors, as reported previously (21Sorscher S. Lillienau J. Meinkoth J.L. Steinbach J.H. Schteingart C.D. Feramisco J. Hofmann A.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 1455-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). [14C]Cholic acid (CA) methyl ester (CA-ME) was synthesized by reaction of CA dissolved in methanol/chloroform (1:2, v/v) with an excess of freshly distilled diazomethane in diethyl ether at room temperature for 12 h (22Vallejo M.

Unlabeled sodium salts of bile acids, CA-ME, estradiol 17β-d-glucuronide (E217βG), GSH and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione, l-glutamic acid, and sodium bicarbonate were purchased from Sigma. As indicated by the supplier, the purity of the bile acids, GSH, and GSSG was more than 98% as determined by thin layer chromatography. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Harvesting and preparation of oocytes were carried out as described elsewhere (23Briz O. Serrano M.A. Rebollo N. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Koepsell H. Marin J.J.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) from mature female frogs (X. laevis), purchased from Regine Olig (Hamburg, Germany) and treated in accordance with the indications of current Spanish and European laws (RD 223/88 and European Union Directive 86/609/CEE) and supervised by the Ethical Committee for Laboratory Animals of the University of Salamanca. Synthesis of cRNAs was performed as described previously (23Briz O. Serrano M.A. Rebollo N. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Koepsell H. Marin J.J.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) using recombinant plasmids containing the open reading frame cDNA of the following proteins: human OATP8/1B3 and OATP-C/1B1 cloned in pCMV6-XL4 and rat Bsep and human carboxylesterase-1 (CES1) cloned in pSPORT1. Incubation time after injection of the cRNA in oocytes was selected based on preliminary experiments on the time course of the functional expression for these carriers (results not shown). Uptake studies were carried out using groups of at least eight oocytes per data point, and experiments were repeated using three different frogs. Oocytes were washed with substrate-free uptake (U) medium (100 mm choline chloride, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, and pH adjusted to 7.5 with Tris) and incubated with 100 μl of U medium containing the desired amount of the substrate to be tested at 25 °C for the indicated time. To investigate the cis-effects (activation or inhibition), the compounds were added to the U medium together with the substrate. Uptake was stopped by the addition of 4 ml of ice-cold U medium, and oocytes were washed three more times before being collected. They were then placed individually in vials to measure radioactive substrate by liquid scintillation. Three different sets of experiments were carried out to investigate the glutathione-induced activation of OATP8/1B3-mediated efflux of bile acids from oocytes. Trans-activation Experiments—Oocytes were injected with cRNA of either human CES1 and OATP8/1B3 or CES1 and rat Bsep, which were used as a positive control of bile acid efflux (22Vallejo M. Briz O. Serrano M.A. Monte M.J. Marin J.J.G. J. Hepatol. 2006; 44: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). After 2 days, the oocytes were incubated with 50 μm [14C]CA-ME at 25 °C for 1 h, which, as has been reported previously (22Vallejo M. Briz O. Serrano M.A. Monte M.J. Marin J.J.G. J. Hepatol. 2006; 44: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), permitted the cells to be loaded with [14C]CA-ME, which was subsequently hydrolyzed to free [14C]CA by CES1. Based on previous studies (22Vallejo M. Briz O. Serrano M.A. Monte M.J. Marin J.J.G. J. Hepatol. 2006; 44: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), because the magnitude of [14C]CA-ME hydrolysis by endogenous esterases is variable, cotransfection with CES1 was carried out to obtain higher and standardized cleavage activity. Bile acid efflux was determined after transferring the oocytes to fresh radioactivity-free medium with or without the activators or inhibitors to be tested and incubating at 25 °C for 2 h. Cis-activation of the Efflux from Oocytes Loaded by Incubation—The oocytes were incubated with 10 μm [14C]taurocholic acid in the absence of GSH at 25 °C for 120 min or in the presence of 20 mm [3H]GSH at 25 °C for 60 min. The efflux of both compounds was determined at different time points after transferring the oocytes to radioactive substrate-free medium at 25 °C. Cis-activation of the Efflux from Oocytes Loaded by Microinjection—The oocytes were directly loaded with 50 nl of U medium containing 300 μm [14C] taurocholic acid alone or with 20 mm [3H]GSH. The efflux of both compounds was determined at different time points after immediately transferring the oocytes to radioactive substrate-free U medium at 25 °C. Some oocytes were used to carry out the analysis of the intracellular balance between reduced and oxidized radioactive glutathione. Groups of three oocytes were treated with 100 μl of lysis/extraction solution (1-butanol, 2-propanol, glacial acetic acid, and methanol, 2.5:2:0.5:1), sonicated in an ice-cold bath for 1 min, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was analyzed by TLC using a mixture of 1-butanol, 2-propanol, glacial acetic acid, methanol, and water (2.5:2:0.5: 1:4) as eluent. In this system, Rf values were 0.45 for GSH and 0.28 for GSSG. In a different set of oocytes, the magnitude of the leak of injected compounds through the hole made in the plasma membrane by the microcapillary was evaluated by measuring the efflux of [3H]inulin that was similarly loaded by microinjection. In these sets of experiments the efflux process was stopped as in the uptake experiments, and the oocytes were processed as described elsewhere (22Vallejo M. Briz O. Serrano M.A. Monte M.J.

Samples from human liver biopsies were obtained at the University Hospital of Salamanca (Spain) in accordance with established protocols, and consent forms were reviewed and approved by the Human Subjects Committee of this hospital. Forty two patients (age 49.6 ± 14.7 S.D.; 50% female) were included in the study after being diagnosed at the Gastroenterology Division of the Salamanca University Hospital with one of the liver diseases indicated in Table 1 and showing biochemical signs of cholestasis. These were elevations above normal values of the serum concentrations of one or more of the following: total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase.TABLE 1Absolute steady-state levels of mRNA for OATPs in control liver tissue and that of patients with cholestatic liver diseasesOATP-A/1A2OATP-C/1B1OATP8/1B31B1/1B3 ratiocopies/106 copies 18 S rRNAControl8 ± 24894 ± 1208923 ± 1485.3Hepatocellular cholestasis12 ± 47444 ± 11461205 ± 1326.2Primary biliary cirrhosis I-II15 ± 74022 ± 657893 ± 684.5Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis7 ± 45500 ± 1779873 ± 1086.3Nonviral hepatitis6 ± 35982 ± 1954961 ± 2736.2Hemochromatosis16 ± 46288 ± 14481335 ± 3584.7 Open table in a new tab Samples were collected for diagnostic purposes, and only the remaining tissue was used for this study. This was immediately immersed in the RNA stabilization reagent RNAlater (Qiagen, Izasa) and stored at –80 °C until total RNA was isolated and absolute abundance measured by real time quantitative RT-PCR using AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Madrid) in an ABI Prism 5700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) as described previously (8Briz O. Serrano M.A. Macias R.I.R. Gonzalez-Gallego J. Marin J.J.G. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Detection of amplification products was carried out using SYBR Green I (Applied Biosystems). No nonspecific product of PCR, as detected by 2.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA melting temperature curves, was found in any case. The results of mRNA abundance for the target genes in each sample were normalized on the basis of its 18 S rRNA content, which was measured using the TaqMan® ribosomal RNA control reagents kit (Applied Biosystems). The primer oligonucleotides sequences and conditions for measuring the absolute abundances of OATP-A/1A2, OATP-C/1B1, and OATP8/1B3 have been reported elsewhere (8Briz O. Serrano M.A. Macias R.I.R. Gonzalez-Gallego J. Marin J.J.G. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as means ± S.D. For kinetic analyses, values were fitted to Michaelis-Menten or Hill equations. Linear regression analyses were carried out by the method of least squares. To calculate the statistical significance of the differences between groups, the paired t test or the Bonferroni method for multiple range testing was used as appropriate. OATP8/1B3-mediated Uptake of Bile Acids in X. laevis Oocytes—OATP8/1B3 expression markedly enhanced the ability of the oocytes to take up E217βG, a prototypic substrate of OATP8/1B3 (10König J. Cui Y. Niesm A.T. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23161-23168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), as compared with noninjected oocytes (Fig. 1A). Because in preliminary experiments no significant difference between oocytes injected with TE buffer and noninjected oocytes regarding their ability to take up bile acids or E217βG was found (data not shown), in this study, noninjected oocytes (wild) were used to determine nonspecific uptake. Similarly, the uptake of several bile acid species differing in their conjugation states and degree of hydroxylation was enhanced in oocytes injected with the cRNA of OATP8/1B3 (Fig. 1A). However, this effect was lower than for E217βG (Fig. 1B). Trans-activation of OATP8/1B3-mediated Bile Acid Efflux—Because bile acid transport by several OATP isoforms, such as rat Oatp1/1a1 and Oatp2/1a4, has been reported to be potentially bidirectional and trans-stimulated by glutathione (14Li L. Lee T.K. Meier P.J. Ballatori N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16184-16191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 15Li L. Meier P.J. Ballatori N. Mol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25591-25595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we investigated these characteristics for OATP8/1B3 using an experimental model described previously (22Vallejo M. Briz O. Serrano M.A. Monte M.J. Marin J.J.G. J. Hepatol. 2006; 44: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To measure bile acid efflux, oocytes expressing CES1 were incubated with radiolabeled CA-ME. This permitted efficient loading of these cells with CA-ME. This was subsequently cleaved to free CA, which then slowly effluxed from the oocytes. This process was enhanced when rat Bsep was expressed in these cells (Fig. 2), which was used here as positive control of the experiment. Although to a lower extent, the expression of OATP8/1B3 also enhanced CA efflux (Fig. 2). On placing taurocholic acid in the extracellular medium, a trans-activation of the OATP8/1B3-mediated efflux of CA was observed (Fig. 2); this is usually interpreted as an indication of the bidirectional transport ability of the carrier. To test whether OATP8/1B3 could work as an exchanger trans-activated by glutathione, inwardly directed glutathione gradients were imposed. Surprisingly, extracellular GSH and GSSG, which had no effect on the CA efflux from noninjected oocytes, induced a significant inhibition of OATP8/1B3-mediated CA efflux. Indeed, the reduction in CA content was even lower than that observed in oocytes expressing only human CES1 (Fig. 2). We speculated then on the possibility that CA molecules that had effluxed from the oocytes could in part be taken up again via OATP8/1B3 because of activation by the inwardly directed glutathione gradient, resulting in a net reduction of bile acid efflux. Cis-activation of OATP8/1B3-mediated Bile Acid Uptake—The next experiments were carried out to elucidate whether re-uptake of the bile acid was indeed involved in the diminished net CA efflux observed when glutathione was placed in the extracellular medium. Both GSH and GSSG, but not other anions such as bicarbonate and glutamate, were able to induce cis-stimulation of OATP8/1B3-mediated uptake of E217βG, taurocholic acid, glycocholic acid (GCA), and CA (Fig. 3). As expected, unlabeled E217βG and taurocholic acid inhibited the uptake of the radiolabeled substrates. We then investigated whether OATP-C/1B1-mediated transport was also sensitive to cis-activation by glutathione. In contrast to what was found for OATP8/1B3, the addition of 20 mm GSH or GSSG to the incubation medium significantly reduced OATP-C/1B1-mediated taurocholic acid uptake (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained when bicarbonate, taurocholic acid, or E217βG was added to the incubation medium (Fig. 4). These results are consistent with the expected behavior of OATP-C/1B1, similar to other members of the OATP family, as an organic anion exchanger (5Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1609: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). The net intracellular accumulation of taurocholic acid reflects the balance between both uptake and efflux mechanisms. Accordingly, in the presence of glutathione or bicarbonate in the medium, the efflux of substrate taken up previously may decrease net taurocholic acid accumulation as compared with that occurring in the absence of inwardly directed glutathione or bicarbonate gradients. The reduction in radiolabeled taurocholic acid uptake by E217βG and taurocholic acid was consistent with competition between these substrates for OATP-C/1B1-mediated uptake (Fig. 4). To perform kinetic analyses under appropriate initial velocity conditions, the time course of taurocholic acid uptake by oocytes expressing OATP8/1B3 was determined (Fig. 5A). The results indicated that 15 min was an appropriate time to obtain a marked signal of uptake still within the linear range of the uptake process. The addition of 20 mm GSH to the extracellular medium had little effect on nonspecific taurocholic acid uptake but markedly increased OATP8/1B3-mediated taurocholic acid uptake (Fig. 5B). Saturation curves were obtained by fitting the values of net taurocholic acid uptake against taurocholic acid concentrations. The best fits for OATP8/1B3-mediated taurocholic acid uptake were to Michaelis-Menten equations. Kinetic parameters were calculated from double-reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plots for taurocholic acid (Fig. 5C) and similarly for other bile acids (Table 2). These results revealed that the GSH-induced enhancement in the efficiency of OATP8/1B3-mediated bile acid transport (ET), defined as the ratio between the maximal velocity of transport (Vmax) and the apparent affinity constant (Km), was mainly because of the increased Vmax value, whereas the Km value was not significantly modified by the presence of GSH.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters of OATP8/1B3-mediated transport of reduced GSH and bile acidsSubstrateActivatorKmVmaxET(Vmax/Km)Rμmpmol/15 min/oocyteGSH4651 ± 690746 ± 1330.160.9969GSHGCA4507 ± 4601596 ± 54ap < 0.05 was compared with uptake in the absence of GSH by the paired t test.0.35ap < 0.05 was compared with uptake in the absence of GSH by the paired t test.0.9982TCA42.2 ± 4.25.9 ± 0.30.140.9988TCAGSH43.3 ± 4.38.6 ± 0.4ap < 0.05 was compared with uptake in the absence of GSH by the paired t test.0.20ap < 0.05 was compared with uptake in the absence of GSH by the paired t test.0.9989GCA43.4 ± 17.84.3 ± 0.60.100.9722GCAGSH43.5 ± 16.45.6 ± 0.8ap < 0.05 was compared with uptake in the absence of GSH by the paired t test.0.13ap < 0.05 was compared with uptake in the absence of GSH by the paired t test.0.9766CA41.8 ± 13.47.0 ± 1.00.170.9884CAGSH41.6 ± 7.89.1 ± 0.8ap < 0.05 was compared with uptake in the absence of GSH by the paired t test.0.22ap < 0.05 was compared with uptake in the absence of GSH by the paired t test.0.9958a p < 0.05 was compared with uptake in the absence of GSH by the paired t test. Open table in a new tab OATP8/1B3-mediated Cotransport of Glutathione and Bile Acids—As kinetic analysis suggested that GSH activates the translocation of the substrate, whether this was because of an interaction of GSH with the protein with or without cotransport of the activator was investigated. Using radiolabeled GSH, it was found that nonspecific GSH uptake was much lower than that observed in oocytes expressing OATP8/1B3 (Figs. 6 and 7A). Moreover, when the values of net OATP8/1B3-mediated GSH uptake versus GSH concentrations were plotted, a saturation curve was obtained. The best fit was a Michaelis-Menten equation, whose kinetic parameters (Fig. 7B and Table 2), revealed values for ET of the same range as those for bile acids, although both Vmax and Km values were markedly higher.FIGURE 7Kinetic analysis of OATP8/1B3-mediated uptake of GSH.

Here we describe the effects of a potent and selective inhibitor of CSF-1R-CYC10268-on CSF-1R-dependent signaling. In in vitro kinase assays, CYC10268 was active in the low nanomolar range and showed selectivity over other kinases such as Abl and Kit. CYC10268 blocked survival mediated by CSF-1R in primary murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) and in the factor-dependent cell line Ba/F3, in which the CSF-1R was ectopically expressed. CYC10268 also inhibited CSF-1 regulated signaling (Akt, ERK-1/2), gene expression (urokinase plasminogen activator, toll-like receptor 9, and apolipoprotein E), and priming of LPS-inducible cytokine production in BMM. In thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (TEPM), which survive in the absence of exogenous CSF-1, CYC10268 impaired LPS-induced cytokine production and regulated expression of known CSF-1 target genes. These observations support the conclusion that TEPM are CSF-1 autocrine and that CSF-1 plays a central role in macrophage effector functions during inflammation. CSF-1R inhibitors such as CYC10268 provide a powerful tool to dissect the role of the CSF-1/CSF-1R signaling system in a range of biological systems and have potential for a number of therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W1966999937,"Increasing evidence suggests that sulfur in ubiquitous iron-sulfur clusters is derived from l-cysteine via cysteine desulfurases. In Escherichia coli, the major cysteine desulfurase activity for biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters has been attributed to IscS. The gene that encodes IscS is a member of an operon iscSUA, which also encodes two highly conserved proteins: IscU and IscA. Previous studies suggested that both IscU and IscA may act as the iron-sulfur cluster assembly scaffold proteins. However, recent evidence indicated that IscA is an iron-binding protein that can provide iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU (Ding, H., Harrison, K., and Lu, J. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 30432–30437). To further elucidate the function of IscA in biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters, we evaluate the iron-sulfur cluster binding activity of IscA and IscU under physiologically relevant conditions. When equal amounts of IscA and IscU are incubated with an equivalent amount of ferrous iron in the presence of IscS, l-cysteine and dithiothreitol, iron-sulfur clusters are assembled in IscU, but not in IscA, suggesting that IscU is a preferred iron-sulfur cluster assembly scaffold protein. In contrast, when equal amounts of IscA and IscU are incubated with an equivalent amount of ferrous iron in the presence of IscS and dithiothreitol but without l-cysteine, nearly all iron is bound to IscA. The iron binding in IscA appears to prevent the formation of the biologically inaccessible ferric hydroxide under aerobic conditions. Subsequent addition of l-cysteine efficiently mobilizes the iron center in IscA and transfers the iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU. The results suggest an intriguing interplay between IscA and IscU in which IscA acts as an iron chaperon that recruits “free” iron and delivers the iron for biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters in IscU under aerobic conditions.

On the other hand, recent studies indicated that IscA is a novel iron binding protein with an iron association constant of 2.0–3.0 × 1019 m–1 in the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system (30Ding H. Harrison K. Lu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30432-30437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or dithiothreitol (31Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that the iron-loaded IscA can provide iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU (32Ding H. Clark R.J. Ding B. J. Biol.

To reconcile the two models proposed for the function of IscA, here we re-evaluated the iron-sulfur cluster binding activity of IscA and IscU under physiologically relevant conditions and found that in the presence of ferrous iron, l-cysteine, and cysteine desulfurase IscS, IscU is a preferred iron-sulfur cluster assembly scaffold protein. On the other hand, when l-cysteine is not present in the incubation solution, IscA acts as an iron chaperon that binds “free” iron. The iron binding in IscA appears to prevent the formation of the biologically inaccessible ferric hydroxide under aerobic conditions. Subsequent addition of l-cysteine mobilizes the iron center in IscA and transfers the iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU even under aerobic conditions. The potential interplay between IscA and IscU for biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters will be discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Preparation—Recombinant E. coli IscA (31Ding H. Clark R.J.

The His-tag in the purified proteins was removed with thrombin and re-purified using a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) (31Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem.

Purif. 1997; 9: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Scott B. Mulrooney (University of Michigan). Both TrxA and TrxB were purified as native form without any tags. The purity of purified proteins was greater than 95% as judged by electrophoresis analysis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. The monomeric concentration of apo-IscA was determined using an extinction coefficient at 260 nm of 2.4 mm–1 cm–1 (31Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The monomeric concentrations of apo-IscU, IscS, TrxA, and TrxB were determined using extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 11.2 mm–1 cm–1, 39.7 mm–1 cm–1, 14.2 mm–1 cm–1, and 17.7 mm–1 cm–1, respectively (31Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of IscA and IscU were referred to the dimeric species in the text. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma.Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly in IscA and IscU—For the iron-sulfur cluster assembly reactions, apo-IscA and/or apo-IscU were incubated with Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 and IscS in the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system (containing thioredoxin 1 (TrxA) (5 μm), thioredoxin reductase (TrxB) (0.5 μm) and NADPH (500 μm)) or dithiothreitol (2 mm) in buffer containing NaCl (200 mm) and Tris (20 mm) (pH 8.0) anaerobically at 37 °C. While both the thioredoxin reductase system and dithiothreitol were effective for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU (30Ding H. Harrison K. Lu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30432-30437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the absorption peak at 340 nm of NADPH in the thioredoxin reductase system introduced an unwanted complication to the absorption spectra of the protein samples. Therefore, dithiothreitol was generally used for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly reactions in this study. For anaerobic conditions, reaction solutions were purged with pure argon gas and preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min before l-cysteine was added to initiate the iron-sulfur cluster assembly reactions. For re-purification of IscA and IscU from the incubation solutions, the samples were diluted with Tris (20 mm) (pH 8.0), and loaded onto a Mono Q column (0.98 ml) (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated with buffer containing Tris (20 mm) (pH 8.0). The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1.0 m) as described previously (30Ding H. Harrison K. Lu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30432-30437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All solutions were purged with argon gas before use. The eluted fractions were immediately analyzed using a Beckman DU640 UV-Vis absorption spectrometer and the SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels. The total iron content in protein samples was determined using an iron indicator ferrozine. Briefly, protein samples were heated at 85 °C for 20 min in the presence of l-cysteine (2 mm) and ferrozine (500 μm). The concentration of the iron-ferrozine complex was measured at 564 nm using an extinction coefficient of 27.9 mm–1 cm–1 (37Cowart R.E. Singleton F.L. Hind J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The total sulfide content in each sample was determined according to the Siegel's method (38Siegel L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 11: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The purified E. coli ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster (39Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30980-30986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was used as a reference for measuring total iron and sulfur contents in the protein samples.Iron Binding in IscA and IscU—For the iron binding experiments, apo-IscA and apo-IscU were incubated with Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 and IscS in the presence of dithiothreitol (2 mm) in buffer containing 200 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) anaerobically at 37 °C for 30 min. IscA and IscU were then repurified from the incubation solutions using a Mono Q column. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the protein samples and their total iron contents were measured as described above. The iron association constants of IscA in the presence or absence of IscU were analyzed using a physiological iron binding competitor citrate (40Crichton R.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 281-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) as described previously (31Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem.

The EPR conditions were: microwave frequency, 9.45 GHz; microwave power, 20 milliwatt; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 2.0 mT; sample temperature, 4.5 K; receive gain, 1.0 × 105.RESULTSIscU Is a Preferred Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly Scaffold Protein—Previously, both IscU (15Agar J.N.

However, their physiological relevance is still not fully understood. It would be of interest to compare the relative iron-sulfur cluster binding activity of IscU and IscA under physiologically relevant conditions.For the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscA, we incubated apo-IscA (25 μm) with cysteine desulfurase IscS (0.5 μm), l-cysteine (1 mm) and ferrous iron (25 μm) in the presence of dithiothreitol (2 mm) anaerobically at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, an absorption peak at 415 nm that was assigned to the iron-sulfur clusters in IscA (22Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Mattioli T. Takahashi Y. Fontecave M. J. Biol.

The absorption spectrum was essentially identical to that reported previously for the [2Fe-2S] cluster-bound IscA (22Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Mattioli T. Takahashi Y. Fontecave M. J. Biol.

Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) emerged (Fig. 1B). As the concentration of apo-IscU was gradually increased (from 0 to 25 μm) in the incubation solution, the amplitude of the absorption peak at 456 nm was progressively increased (Fig. 1, B–D). At the equal concentrations of apo-IscA (25 μm) and apo-IscU (25 μm) (Fig. 1D), the observed absorption spectrum was essentially identical to that when only apo-IscU (25 μm) was used with no apo-IscA in the incubation solution.To further analyze the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscA and IscU, both proteins were re-purified from the above incubation solutions. As shown in Fig. 2A, IscA and IscU were well separated using a Mono Q column. The UV-Vis absorption measurements of the re-purified proteins revealed that the amount of iron-sulfur clusters assembled in IscA was gradually decreased with a concomitant increase of the iron-sulfur clusters assembled in IscU as the concentration of apo-IscU was increased from 0 to 25 μm. At the equal concentrations of apo-IscA (25 μm) and apo-IscU (25 μm), the re-purified IscA had little or no iron-sulfur clusters (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, the re-purified IscU showed a major absorption peak at 456 nm and a minor peak at 420 nm (Fig. 2B), indicative of the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU (15Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2IscU is a preferred iron-sulfur cluster assembly scaffold protein.

After incubation, IscA and IscU were re-purified using a Mono Q column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Panel a, the elution profile of IscA and IscU from a Mono Q column.

The high absorption at 280 nm of IscU is due to its large extinction coefficient (11.2 mm–1 cm–1).

This observation is consistent with the previous report that the iron-sulfur clusters in IscU are EPR silent and are quickly decomposed after reduction with dithionite (15Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar).The total iron content analyses of the IscA and IscU fractions shown in Fig. 2B revealed that the ratio of iron to the IscA dimer in fraction 8 was 0.05 ± 0.03 (n = 3), whereas the ratio of iron to the IscU dimer in fraction 10 was 0.85 ± 0.08 (n = 3). The amount of sulfide in fraction 8 was not detectable. In contrast, the ratio of sulfide to the IscU dimer in fraction 10 was 0.78 ± 0.10 (n = 3). These results further suggest that under physiologically relevant conditions, iron-sulfur clusters were assembled in IscU but not in IscA.No absorption peaks from 400 nm to 600 nm were observed without apo-IscA or apo-IscU in the incubation solution (Fig. 3d), indicating that the observed iron-sulfur clusters were assembled in the proteins. However, a number of proteins containing free thiol groups have been shown to form nonspecific iron-sulfur clusters in the presence of ferrous iron and sulfide in vitro (41Arakawa S. Kimura T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 580: 382-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To test this idea, we used BSA as an example for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly. BSA contains 35 cysteine residues, which are about five times as many cysteine residues in the IscA or IscU dimer. When BSA (5 μm) was incubated with IscS (0.5 μm), l-cysteine (1 mm) and ferrous iron (25 μm) in the presence of dithiothreitol (2 mm) anaerobically at 37 °C for 30 min, an absorption peak at 415 nm representing the iron-sulfur cluster assembly appeared (Fig. 3c). The observed spectrum of BSA was almost indistinguishable to that of IscA (Fig. 3b) but was very different from that of IscU (Fig. 3a), suggesting that the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscA could in fact be nonspecific.FIGURE 3Iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU, IscA, and bovine serum albumin. a, apo-IscU (25 μm) was incubated with IscS (0.5 μm) and Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 (25 μm) in the presence of dithiothreitol (2 mm) anaerobically at 37 °C. The UV-Vis absorption spectra were taken 30 min after l-cysteine (1 mm) was added. b, same as in a, except apo-IscA (25 μm) was used instead of apo-IscU. c, same as in a except BSA (5 μm) was used instead of apo-IscU. d, same as in a except no apo-IscU was added.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)IscA Acts as an Iron Chaperon When l-Cysteine Is Not Present—The iron-sulfur cluster assembly requires a coordinated delivery of both iron and sulfide.

Conceivably, the intracellular l-cysteine content could be a major determining factor for the overall biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters.To emulate the conditions at which the intracellular l-cysteine is limited, we incubated apo-IscA (25 μm), apo-IscU (25 μm), and IscS (0.5 μm) with ferrous iron (25 μm) in the presence of dithiothreitol (2 mm) anaerobically at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, both IscA and IscU were re-purified using a Mono Q column.

However, integration sites are randomly distributed in the genome and transgene expression can be influenced by position effects. We developed a novel technology that utilizes chimeric transposases to direct integration into specific sites on a target DNA molecule. The Gal4 DNA binding domain was fused to the NH(2) terminus of the Mos1 and piggyBac transposases and a target plasmid was created that contained upstream activating sequences (UAS), to which the Gal4 DBD binds with high affinity. The transpositional activity of the Gal4-Mos1 transposase was 12.7-fold higher compared to controls where the Gal4-UAS interaction was absent and 96% of the recovered transposition products were identical, with integration occurring at the same TA site. In a parallel experiment, a Gal4-piggyBac transposase resulted in an 11.6-fold increase in transpositional activity compared to controls, with 67% of the integrations occurring at a single TTAA site. This technology has the potential to minimize nonspecific integration events that may result in insertional mutagenesis and reduced fitness. Site-directed integration will be advantageous to the manipulation of genomes, study of gene function, and for the development of gene therapy techniques."

https://openalex.org/W1981381293,"The interaction between VPg of turnip mosaic virus and wheat germ eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F (the complex of eIFiso4E and eIFiso4G) were measured and compared. The fluorescence quenching data showed the presence of one binding site on eIFiso4E for VPg. Scatchard analysis revealed the binding affinity (Ka) and average binding sites (n) for VPg were (8.51 ± 0.21) × 106 M–1 and 1.0, respectively. The addition of eIFiso4G to the eIFiso4E increased the binding affinity 1.5-fold for VPg as compared with eIFiso4E alone. However, eIFiso4G alone did not bind with VPg. The van't Hoff analyses showed that VPg binding is enthalpy-driven and entropy-favorable with a large negative ΔH°(–29.32 ± 0.13 kJmol–1) and positive ΔS° (36.88 ± 0.25 Jmol–1K–1). A Lineweaver-Burk plot indicates mixed-type competitive ligand binding between VPg and anthraniloyl-7-methylguanosine triphosphate for eIFiso4E. Fluorescence stopped-flow studies of eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F with VPg show rapid binding, suggesting kinetic competition between VPg and m7G cap. The VPg protein binds much faster than cap analogs. The activation energies for binding of eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F with VPg were 50.70 ± 1.27 and 75.37 ± 2.95 kJmol–1 respectively. Enhancement of eIFiso4F-VPg binding with the addition of a structured RNA derived from tobacco etch virus suggests that translation initiation involving VPg occurs at internal ribosomal entry sites. Furthermore, the formation of a protein-RNA complex containing VPg suggests the possibility of direct participation of VPg in the translation of the viral genome.

Viral RNAs share characteristics with the host cell mRNAs but must employ different strategies for preferential translation.

Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) belongs to the potyvirus group, a member of the super group of picorna-like viruses (4Riechmann J.L. Lain S. Garcia J.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The viral genome is a positive single-stranded RNA molecule of about 10 kilobases in length, a poly(A) tail at the 3′-end, and a VPg of molecular mass 22–24 kDa (5Murphy J.F. Rhoads R.E. Hunt A.G.

The potyviral VPg is multifunctional, and interaction between VPg and eIF4E has been reported for TuMV (2Leonard S. Plante D. Wittmann S. Daigneault N. Fortin M.G. Laliberte J.-F. J.

Virology. 1997; 234: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), but the consequences of this interaction with respect to translation initiation are not clear because elements in the 5′-untranslated region of the potyviral RNA direct cap-independent translation (9Carrington J. Freed D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1590-1597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viral proteins are likely to participate in the regulation of viral genome translation (10Thompson S.R. Sarnow P. Curr. Opin.

VPg has several suggested roles in the virus life cycle. Interactions of VPg with the viral RNA polymerase in yeast (12Hong Y. Levay K. Murphy J.F. Klein P.G. Shaw J.G. Hunt A.G.

Virol. 1998; 79: 2043-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) support a role in viral RNA synthesis. Additionally, VPg has been implicated in overcoming resistance in plants (15Keller K.E.

VPg-Pro of tobacco etch potyvirus also interacts with eIF4E from tomato and tobacco, and the interaction was shown to enhance genome amplification (20Schaad M.C. Anderberg R.J. Carrington J.C. Virology. 2000; 273: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).In wheat germ (Triticum aestivum) and other plants, an isoform of eIF4F called eIFiso4F has been found (21Browning K.S. Lax S.R. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11228-11232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Browning K.S. Webster C. Roberts J.K. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10096-10100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). eIFiso4F functions like eIF4F in supporting cap-dependent in vitro translation (22Browning K.S. Webster C. Roberts J.K. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10096-10100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, eIF4F and eIFiso4F show preferences for translation of structured and unstructured non-coding regions, respectively. eIFiso4F contains two subunits, a 28-kDa eIFiso4E and an 86-kDa eIFiso4G. The eIFiso4E acts as the binding site of m7GpppN cap. eIFiso4G binds to mRNA in an ATP-dependent manner, may interact with eIF4A and eIF4B (23Balasta M.L. Carberry S.E. Friedland D.E. Perez R.A. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18599-18603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and more interestingly, may interact with poly(A)-binding protein (24Le H. Tanguay R.L. Balasta M.L.

Some structural and functional similarity exists between eIF4F and eIFiso4F. Functionally, they are very similar even though these two proteins are antigenically distinct (26Lax S. Fritz W. Browning K. Ravel J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Wheat germ eIFiso4F can substitute for mammalian eIF4F in an RNA-dependent ATPase activity and in cross-linking of mammalian eIF4A to the cap of oxidized mRNA (27Abramson R.D. Browning K.S. Dever T.E. Lawson T.G. Thach R.E. Ravel J.M. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5462-5467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The interaction between the VPg of TuMV and the translation eukaryotic initiation factor eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F of Arabidopsis thaliana has previously been reported (2Leonard S.

Virology. 1997; 234: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These observations suggest VPg is important in initiation of protein synthesis, perhaps functioning as a cap analogue, as proposed by Herbert and co-workers (28Herbert T.P. Brierley I. Brown T.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 1033-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Michon et al. (29Michon T. Estevez Y. Walter J. German-Retana S. Le Gall O. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 1312-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) characterized the interaction of lettuce eIF4E and VPg from lettuce mosaic virus. Earlier studies (30Miyoshi H. Suehiro N. Tomoo K. Muto S. Takahashi T. Tsukamoto T. Ohmori T. Natsuaki T. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have shown that interaction between VPg and plant eIFiso4E is sufficiently strong so that VPg competes with cap binding. In this study we further characterize this interaction, determine the effects of eIFiso4G on the VPg and eIFiso4E interaction, and demonstrate an interaction with viral RNA. The kinetics of binding suggest that VPg binding to eIFiso4F is favored. We propose a mechanism where VPg substitutes for the cap analog and enhances formation of an eIFiso4F complex with viral internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The TuMV full-length cDNA clone and construction of the expression vector for TuMV VPg was described previously (30Miyoshi H.

Okuda S. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 2087-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B and m7GTP-Sepharose were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow was purchased from Qiagen K. K. The HiTrap Mono Q, HiTrap SP column, and PreScission protease were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The pET21a and pET28a expression vectors were purchased from Novagen, an affiliate of Merck. Buffer A was 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole. Buffer B was 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole. Buffer C was 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol. Buffer D was 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—eIFiso4E and eIFiso4G were expressed in Escherichia coli containing the constructed pET3d vector in BL21 (DE3) pLysS as described elsewhere (32van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A HiTrap Mono Q ion exchange column and an m7-GTP-Sepharose column were used for the purification of eIFiso4E. E. coli cells were disrupted by sonication, suspended in buffer B-600 (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 600 mm KCl) containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.5 ml of aprotinin, and 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor for 30 min (S11 supernatant) to separate soluble eIFiso4E from inclusion bodies. The S11 supernatant was centrifuged at 45,000 rpm in a Sorvall TV-850 rotor for 3 h (S175 supernatant) to remove ribosomes and additional aggregates. The S175 supernatant was dialyzed against buffer B-50 (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.0, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl). The dialyzed sample was applied to a 5-ml HiTrap Mono Q column equilibrated with 10 bed volumes of buffer B-50 with a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The column was washed at the same flow rate with buffer B-50 until optical density returned to base line. The expressed eIFiso4E was eluted with 50–400 mm KCl linear gradient at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The peak was collected in 1.0-ml fractions. To maximize purity, the sample was subsequently applied to a 4-ml m7GTP-Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer B-50. The column was washed with buffer B-50 followed by 25 ml of buffer B-50 containing 0.1 mm GTP to remove GTP-binding proteins. The expressed eIFiso4E was eluted from the column with 15 ml of buffer B-50 containing 100 mm GTP. After 2 ml of the elution buffer had entered the column, the column was turned off for 30 min. Elution was resumed, and column fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. The fractions were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A HiTrap SP column was used to purify eIFiso4G by the following procedure (32van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli cells were disrupted by alumina, suspended in buffer B-600, and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 2 h. The supernatant was dialyzed against buffer B-50, loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap SP column, and washed with B-50 buffer until the optical density returned to the base line. A 50–400 mm KCl linear gradient (total volume 100 ml) was used to elute the eIFiso4G, and 1.0-ml fractions were collected. The eIFiso4G appeared in the 200–300 mm KCl fractions. After purification, the purity was confirmed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All steps were carried out in a cold box at ∼5 °C.For purification of TuMV VPg (30Miyoshi H. Suehiro N. Tomoo K. Muto S. Takahashi T. Tsukamoto T. Ohmori T. Natsuaki T. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were transformed with pETVPg1. Cells were cultured in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 25 °C. At an A600 of 0.5, expression was induced for 6 h with 50 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, after which cells were harvested by centrifugation. Subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended into buffer A and disrupted by sonication, and the lysates were centrifuged. Supernatant was applied to a 1-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed 3 times with 10 ml of buffer A, and the bound protein was eluted with 5 ml of buffer B. The protein was dialyzed against buffer C, further purified to homogeneity on Mono Q and HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 pg columns, and finally dialyzed against buffer D. The purified VPg-His6 was confirmed by 15% SDS-PAGE.All samples were dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mm EDTA) and passed through a 0.22 μm filter (Millipore) before the spectroscopy measurements were performed. The fractions were concentrated with a Centricon 10 (Amicon Co.) as necessary. The concentrations of protein were determined by a Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as standard (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad).The Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) mRNA Synthesis in Vitro—The (TEV PK1 and S1-3 of PK1) clones were described previously (34Zeenko V. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26813-26824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). DNA was linearized with SalI, a site immediately upstream of the luc open reading frame. The linearized DNA was treated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing proteinase K (100 μg/ml), 0.5% SDS, and 5 mm CaCl2 for 30 min at 37 °C. DNA was further purified by phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) at pH 8.0 and ethanol precipitation. Purity was confirmed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and concentration was determined spectrophotometrically after linearization and brought to 0.5 mg/ml. In vitro transcription of PK1 and S1-3 of PK1 were carried out using Promega RiboMAX™ large scale RNA Production System-T7. Setting of reaction conditions and purification of synthesized RNA was according to the protocol as described in Promega RiboMAX™ kit. The concentration of RNA was determined by measuring the optical density at 260 nm. The purity of synthesized RNA was checked by measuring the absorbance ratio A260/A280 nm in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water.Fluorescence Titration Measurements—Fluorescence measurements were performed using a Spex Fluorolog τ2 spectrofluorimeter equipped with excitation and emission polarizers. The formation of the binary protein-protein and protein-RNA complexes was studied by direct fluorescence titration. The excitation and emission slits were set on 4 and 5 nm, respectively. The excitation wavelength for eIFiso4E was 280 nm, and emission was monitored at 332 nm. The excitation slits were chosen to avoid photobleaching, and the absorbance of the sample at the excitation wavelength was less than 0.02 to minimize the inner-filter effect. Emission spectra were corrected for the wavelength-dependent lamp intensity and monochromator sensitivities.The samples were thermostated at the different temperatures, i.e. 5, 10, 15, 22, 25, and 32 ± 0.5 °C. The temperature was monitored by a thermocouple inside the cuvette. Titrations were performed in 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 1.0 mm DTT. The normalized fluorescence difference (ΔF/ΔFmax) between the protein-protein complex and the sum of the individual fluorescence spectra was used to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd). The details of the data fitting are described elsewhere (35Khan M.A. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9092-9097Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensities, when necessary, were corrected for dilution and for inner filter effect. Nonlinear least squares fitting of the data were performed using KaleidaGraph software (Version 2.1.3; Abelbeck Software).Determination of the Number of Binding Sites—Protein-protein interaction of genome-linked protein (VPg) of turnip mosaic virus with wheat germ eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F (complex of eIFiso4E and eIFiso4G) were studied by direct fluorescence titration. A solution of purified eIFiso4E (0.5 μm) was titrated with increasing amounts of VPg protein. The fluorescence intensity at emission maximum (332 nm) was used for calculating the relative fluorescence, considering the fluorescence intensity of control untreated eIFiso4E as 100. The fractional quench, Q, was determined at each VPg/eIFiso4E molar ratio (R). For an observed fluorescence intensity F, the fractional quench, Q, was obtained from the equation Q = (Fo – F)/m (maximal quench)). Fractional quench, Q, is linearly related to VPg binding, [VPg-eIFiso4E]/[eIFiso4E]T = Q, where [eIFiso4E]T represents the total protein concentration. The average number of binding sites (n) were determined from intercept on the x axis of the Scatchard plot Q versus Q/(R – Q)[eIFiso4E]T (36Khan M.A. Muzammil S. Musarrat J. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2002; 30: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 37Levine R.L. Clin. Chem. 1977; 23: 2292-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The slope also gives Ka, which is in agreement with Ka obtained from nonlinear least square fitting.Thermodynamic Parameters for eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F Binding to VPg—The temperature dependence of Keq for VPg was analyzed according to the van't Hoff isobaric equation assuming the entropy change, ΔS°, and the enthalpy change, ΔH°, as constants over the range of temperatures studied.-lnKeq=1RΔHoT-ΔSoCompetitive Binding Experiments—The fluorescent cap analogue, anthraniloyl (Ant)-m7GTP, was synthesized as described previously (38Ren J. Goss D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3629-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The competitive substitution reactions were performed at constant Ant-m7GTP concentration (0.1 μm) and increasing amounts of VPg. The fluorescence measurements were made at 25 °C in 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 1.0 mm DTT. An excitation wavelength of 332 nm was used to monitor the Ant-m7GTP fluorescence emission at 420 nm.Stopped-flow Fluorescence Kinetics—Stopped-flow fluorescence experiments were performed on an OLIS RSM 1000 stopped-flow system with a 1-ms dead time. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the cut-on filter was 324 nm for eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F with VPg interactions. A reference photomultiplier was used to monitor fluctuations in the lamp intensity. The temperature of the flow cell and solution reservoirs was maintained using a temperature-controlled circulating water bath. VPg binding induced a decrease in eIFiso4E fluorescence. After rapid mixing of 1 μm (0.5 μm after mixing) eIFiso4E or eIFiso4F with 5 μm (2.5 μm after mixing) VPg, the time course of the fluorescence intensity change was recorded by computer data acquisition. In each experiment, 1000 pairs of data were recorded, and sets of data from 3 experiments were averaged. Each averaged set of stopped-flow data was then fitted to nonlinear analytical equations using Global analysis software provided by OLIS. Data were fitted to the single and double exponential functions. Fitted curves correspond to the single exponential equation (39Olsen K. Christensen U. Sierks M.R. Svensson B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9686-9693Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar),Ft=ΔFexp(-kobst)+F∞ where Ft is that fluorescence observed at any time, t, ΔF is the amplitude, ΔF∞ is the final value of fluorescence, and kobs is the observed first-order rate constant. The kinetic data for double exponential fitsFt=ΔF1exp(-kobs1t)+ΔF2exp(-kobs2t)+F∞ where ΔF1 and ΔF2 are the amplitudes of two exponentials with rate constants kobs1 and kobs2, respectively. The residuals were measured by the differences between the calculated fit and the experimental data. The reaction was consistent with a single exponential process. The derived rate constants were used to construct an Arrhenius plot according to the equation,lnk=-EaRT+lnA(Eq. 4) where k is the rate constant, Ea is the activation energy, and A is the Arrhenius pre-exponential term. The activation energy was calculated from the slope of the fitted linear plot of ln k versus 1/T (Kelvin).Dissociation Rate Constants—To measure the dissociation rate constants, a complex of eIFiso4E or eIFiso4F with VPg was rapidly diluted 15-fold in a spectrofluorimeter cuvette, and the resulting increase in fluorescence was measured. Because of the high binding affinity of the protein-protein complex, a large dilution, which could not be accomplished by stopped-flow, was necessary. The concentration of the reactants before mixing was 10 μm VPg and 2 μm (each) eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F, respectively. The dissociation rates were determined from fits of the appropriate equations to the data using nonlinear least-square fitting program KaleidaGraph software (Version 2.1.3, Abelbeck software).RESULTSFluorescence Titration of eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F with VPg—To determine the binding constants for the viral protein linked to the genome (VPg) of TuMV and wheat germ eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F, direct fluorescence titration studies were performed as shown in Fig. 1. After the inner-filter effect corrections, we observed a total percent quench 58 and 50% for eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F fluorescence upon the addition of VPg at the highest molar ratios. The inset in Fig. 1 shows the corresponding Scatchard plots. The slope and intercept of the straight line obtained on the plot Q/[VPg] × 10–6 versus Q provided the binding constant (Ka) and binding capacity (n) of translation initiation factors for viral genome-linked protein (VPg). Kd values were obtained using a non-linear least squares analysis described elsewhere (35Khan M.A. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9092-9097Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). eIFiso4F exhibited almost 1.5 times stronger binding affinity than eIFiso4E (eIFiso4F, Kd = 81.31 ± 1.9 nm; eIFiso4E, Kd = 117.48 ± 2.7 nm). Similarly, the average binding sites (n) of eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F for VPg were determined to be 0.98 ± 0.15. Scatchard analysis of the binding data (Fig. 1) suggests that eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F each bound a single VPg.Fig. 2 shows a representative plot of eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F with VPg for determination of the dissociation constant (Kd). The titration curve in Fig. 2 shows the difference in fluorescence intensity between the protein-protein complex and the sum of the individual fluorescence intensities. From such analysis, the equilibrium binding constant can be calculated for the interactions between eIFiso4E or eIFiso4F with VPg (Table 1). eIFiso4E showed a strong interaction with VPg in the presence of eIFiso4G. No interaction was observed between eIFiso4G and VPg. A comparison of the dissociation constants at different temperatures is shown in Table 1. eIFiso4F has a higher affinity for VPg with a dissociation constant of 62.43 ± 0.61 nm as compared with eIFiso4E (97.47 ± 1.6 nm) at 22 °C. From the temperature dependence of these dissociation constants, the thermodynamic parameters for eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F with VPg were calculated (Table 2). A von't Hoff plot of –ln Keq versus the reciprocal of temperature (T –1) was used to calculate the thermodynamic parameters, entropy (ΔS°), and enthalpy (ΔH°). Fig. 3 shows the van't Hoff plot based on VPg binding to eIFiso4E or eIFiso4F; the values of ΔH° and ΔS° were obtained from the intercept and slope, respectively (correlation coefficient of >0.95). The van't Hoff analyses showed that the VPg binding is enthalpy-driven and entropy-favorable with a large negative ΔH°(–29.32 ± 0.13 kJmol–1) and positive ΔS° (36.88 ± 0.25 Jmol–1K–1) for eIFiso4E. The ΔG° values at 25 °C were calculated from equation, ΔG° = –RT ln Keq. The ΔG° values for eIFiso4E (–39.53 ± 0.32 kJmol–1) and eIFiso4F (–40.45 ± 0.51 kJmol–1) with VPg were shown in Table 2. Although the ΔG° value for the binding of VPg to eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F was almost the same, the data suggest different forces driving the interaction. The binding of eIFiso4E-VPg and eIFiso4F-VPg occurs as enthalpy-driven with large negative ΔH° and large positive ΔS°, leading to a negative ΔG° (Table 2). However, the activation energy for eIFiso4F is substantially larger, suggesting an energetically less favorable transition state.FIGURE 2Representative fluorescence intensity measurements on binding of eIFiso4E (○) and eIFiso4F (▵) to VPg. eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F, each at an initial concentration of 500 nm, were titrated by VPg. The curves shown are for the same concentrations to give an accurate comparison. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the emission was 332 nm. The fluorescence is normalized by using the formula fb = (F0 – Fobs)/(Fobs – F∞)(F0/F∞) + (F0 – Fobs), which is directly related to the fraction of protein bound (fb).

https://openalex.org/W2037188661,"The human ACF chromatin-remodeling complex (hACF) contains the ATPase motor protein SNF2h and the non-catalytic hACF1 subunit. Here, we have compared the ability of SNF2h and a reconstituted hACF complex containing both SNF2h and hACF1 to remodel a series of nucleosomes containing different lengths of DNA overhang. Both SNF2h and hACF functioned in a manner consistent with sliding a canonical nucleosome. However, the non-catalytic subunit, hACF1, altered the remodeling properties of SNF2h by changing the nature of the requirement for a DNA overhang in the nucleosomal substrate and altering the DNA accessibility profile of the remodeled products. Surprisingly, addition of hACF1 to SNF2h increased the amount of DNA overhang needed to observe measurable amounts of DNA accessibility, but decreased the amount of overhang needed for a measurable binding interaction. We propose that these hACF1 functions might contribute to making the hACF complex more efficient at nucleosome spacing compared with SNF2h. In contrast, the SWI/SNF complex and its ATPase subunit BRG1 generated DNA accessibility profiles that were similar to each other, but different significantly from those of hACF and SNF2h. Thus, we observed divergent remodeling behaviors in these two remodeling families and found that the manner in which hACF1 alters the remodeling behavior of the ATPase is not shared by SWI/SNF subunits.

Regulation of chromatin structure is crucial to many fundamental cellular processes such as replication and transcription activation and repression (1Havas K. Whitehouse I. Owen-Hughes T. CMLS Cell.

The two classes of mechanisms that are believed to regulate structure are covalent and noncovalent modifications (1Havas K. Whitehouse I. Owen-Hughes T. CMLS Cell. Mol.

Covalent modifications to chromatin include acetylation, deacetylation, methylation, ubiquitylation, and phosphorylation (4Jenuwein T. Allis C.D.

Noncovalent modifications encompass several mechanisms, the most prominent of which involves ATP hydrolysis-driven, multisubunit complexes whose central subunits are ATPases of the SNF2 superfamily (1Havas K.

These complexes are divided into at least four subfamilies defined by the ATPase catalytic subunits Swi2/Snf2, ISWI, CHD, and Swr1. The ISWI family has the most identified members of remodeling complexes, each of which contains a small number of noncatalytic subunits. In contrast, the members of the SWI/SNF family, the second most abundant remodeling family, contain a total of 10–15 subunits. Human complexes that contain the human ISWI homolog SNF2h include RSF (remodeling and spacing factor; contains SNF2h and RSF1), WICH (WSTF-ISWI chromatin remodeling; contains WSTF and SNF2h), hACF (ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor; contains ACF1 and SNF2h), hCHRAC (chromatin accessibility complex; contains SNF2h, hACF1, p15, and p17), NoRC (nucleolar remodeling complex; contains SNF2h and TIP5), and the SNF2h/cohesin/NuRD complex (8Loyola A.

This diversity in SNF2h-based complexes raises the question of the mechanistic role played by these different subunits in the process of nucleosome remodeling. The ISWI-based complexes have varied functions. For example, studies have suggested that ISWI complexes are involved in various aspects of transcription (14Deuring R. Fanti L. Armstrong J.A. Sarte M.

In addition, mouse NoRC is involved in the formation of heterochromatin and silencing of rDNA (12Strohner R. Nemeth A. Jansa P. Hofmann-Rohrer U. Santoro R. Langst G. Grummt I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 20Santoro R. Li J. Grummt I. Nat.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2231-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ISWI has been implicated in the maintenance of higher order chromatin structure and the facilitation of DNA replication through heterochromatin (14Deuring R. Fanti L. Armstrong J.A. Sarte M. Papoulas O. Prestel M. Daubresse G. Verardo M. Moseley S.L. Berloco M. Tsukiyama T. Wu C. Pimpinelli S. Tamkun J.W. Mol.

Schalch T. Kulangara A. Duda S. Schroeder R.R. Richmond T.J. Science. 2004; 306: 1571-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The ability of the Drosophila dACF and CHRAC complexes to create regular spacing of nucleosomes suggests that this is an important property of these complexes in vivo (10Ito T. Bulger M. Pazin M.J. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 90: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 23Ito T. Levenstein M.E. Fyodorov D.V. Kutach A.K. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T.

Although both ISWI and the dACF complex can space nucleosomes, dACF is more efficient (23Ito T. Levenstein M.E. Fyodorov D.V. Kutach A.K. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 24Fyodorov D.V. Blower M.D. Karpen G.H. Kadonaga J.T.

Other data suggest a more intricate interaction between ISWI and the dACF1 subunit in dACF than simple enhancement of ISWI activity. ISWI by itself prefers to move centrally located nucleosomes to the end of the template, whereas dACF prefers to move end-located nucleosomes to the central position (27Eberharter A. Ferrari S.

Differences in remodeling outcome catalyzed by the motor proteins in the ISWI and SWI/SNF complexes have been demonstrated previously (3Becker P.B. Horz W. Annu. Rev.

ISWI family complexes can efficiently slide nucleosomes, and their remodeling products have characteristics of canonical nucleosomes. In contrast, SWI/SNF family complexes create products with characteristics distinct from those of canonical nucleosomes and are able to efficiently create access to sites near the center of the nucleosome. These observations have led to the hypothesis that these remodeling complexes function by distinct mechanisms. Studies to date show that additional subunits in the SWI/SNF family of complexes can alter biological targeting of the complex and can increase the specific activity of the complex (35Hsiao P.W.

Cell. 1999; 3: 247-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), but these studies have not shown significant changes caused by the non-catalytic subunits in the nature of the remodeling function of the complex. In contrast, initial data on directionality of movement have raised the possibility that partner proteins of ISWI might cause more substantive changes in remodeling outcome (27Eberharter A. Ferrari S. Langst G. Straub T. Imhof A. Varga-Weisz P. Wilm M. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 28Eberharter A. Vetter I. Ferreira R. Becker P.B.

The major goal of this work was to measure the remodeling activity of SNF2h as an isolated protein and to compare its activity with that of the hACF complex. Previous work implied that ISWI family proteins require a nucleosomal DNA overhang for remodeling and that the length of overhang might affect the activity of the complex in binding to nucleosomes (31Strohner R.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2092-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, we set out to investigate the remodeling efficiencies of SNF2h and the hACF complex at a series of enzyme restriction sites throughout the nucleosome using an extensive set of templates with different lengths of DNA overhang. In addition, we also compared their activities in spacing nucleosomes. Our data suggest that, although SNF2h and hACF share a dependence on the presence of a nucleosomal DNA overhang, the nature of that dependence is changed in that hACF prefers substrates with longer overhangs. Furthermore, both SNF2h and hACF activities created regularly spaced nucleosomes on chromatin that had been assembled on supercoiled plasmid. In contrast, consistent with previous data, BRG1 and BRG1-based SWI/SNF complex remodeling did not require extranucleosomal DNA overhangs. Additional SWI/SNF subunits did not appear to significantly alter the characteristics of BRG1 function, revealing intriguing difference between the two families of complexes in the interaction between the motor protein and its binding partners.

Cell. 2001; 8: 1219-1230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Nucleosome Mobility Assay—All reactions were performed in 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 60 mm KCl, 8% glycerol, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP·Mg, and 0.02% Nonidet P-40. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. Time course experiments were performed to show that these reactions were complete within 5 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of 157 nm ADP and 1.5 μg of salmon sperm DNA. The samples were run on 0.5× Tris acetate/EDTA 5% gels (33Fan H.-Y. He X. Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1311-1322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Determination of the Specific Activities of hACF and SNF2h—The specific activities of SNF2h and hACF were determined under the conditions described previously (33Fan H.-Y. He X. Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1311-1322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). 1 unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to generate 1 pmol of PstI-accessible mononucleosomes (substrate C91-25)/min at 30 °C. Rate constants were obtained from initial rates determined by linear fits of data for the first 15% of cut substrates. ATPase Assay—ATPase assays were performed using Michaelis-Menten conditions as described previously (32Aalfs J.D. Narlikar G.J. Kingston R.E. J. Biol.

To determine the Km of the remodelers for nucleosomal and naked DNA substrates, increasing amounts of substrates were titrated into reactions containing limited amounts of remodelers. To assay the turnover rate of ATP by the remodelers, saturating concentrations of remodelers and nucleosomes were used. Array Assembly—2 kilobase pairs of supercoiled plasmid DNA G1E10 (10Ito T.

Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) were assembled into arrays with HeLa core histone by salt dialysis (45). The ratio of DNA to histone was ∼1:1, and the final concentration of the array was 0.12 μg/μl. Spacing Assay—All reactions were performed in 8 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 8 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP·Mg, 8% glycerol, 30 mm creatine phosphate, 6 ng/μl creatine kinase, and 0.4 mm EGTA at 30 °C for 3–4.5 h. The concentration of the array used was 5 μg/ml, and the concentration of the remodelers used was 1 μg/ml. After the array was incubated with each remodeler in the presence or absence of ATP, all the reactions were digested with micrococcal nuclease (Sigma) at two different concentrations (0.001 μg/μl and 0.5 ng/μl) for 5 min in 25 °C. The concentration of SNF2h and hACF used was 0.001 μg/ml each. After the reactions were stopped with 2% SDS, DNA was extracted from each reaction by proteinase K digestion (0.5 μg/μl; Sigma), followed by phenol/chloroform purification. Ethanol-precipitated DNA samples were resuspended in Tris/EDTA and resolved by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis in 1× Tris acetate/EDTA buffer against a 123-bp DNA ladder (Invitrogen). To examine how non-catalytic subunits in a remodeling complex might alter the function of the central ATP-dependent subunit, we compared the ATPase SNF2h in isolation with the hACF complex, which contains both SNF2h and the non-catalytic subunit hACF1. We used two protocols to examine the activity of these proteins following their purification from baculovirus-infected cells (Fig. 1A). The first protocol monitors the shift in nucleosome position upon remodeling using native gel electrophoresis. This protocol has been used previously to demonstrate that mammalian complexes containing SNF2h and Drosophila complexes containing SNF2h homologs change the translational position of the nucleosome (also referred to as “sliding” of the nucleosome) (27Eberharter A.

Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The preparations used here were able to move end-positioned nucleosomes that contained 120 bp of additional DNA to the 147 bp that formed the nucleosome. Both SNF2h and hACF moved the nucleosome away from the end position toward the center, thus slowing the mobility of the nucleosomal fragment. As anticipated from previous work, the hACF complex had higher activity compared with SNF2h alone in that hACF could move nucleosomes away from the starting position at lower concentrations than SNF2h alone (Fig. 1B). The remodeling activities of SNF2h and hACF can be more readily quantified using a second protocol that measures restriction enzyme accessibility. Previously occluded restriction enzyme sites in nucleosomal DNA are made accessible when a productive remodeling event occurs (42Narlikar G.J. Phelan M.L. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1219-1230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 46Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Therefore, the rate of remodeling can be determined by measuring the rate of restriction enzyme cleavage in the presence of a remodeler and ATP. In describing these restriction enzyme accessibility experiments, we refer to the “short end” of the mononucleosome as the end of the template that lacks an extranucleosomal DNA overhang, whereas the “long end” has a DNA overhang. The mononucleosome used here had a 91-bp overhang at the long end and a PstI site that was 25 bp away from the short end of the nucleosomal DNA and thus was occluded for cleavage upon assembly into nucleosomes. Access to the PstI site is believed to be created by moving the nucleosome by at least 25 bp onto free DNA. Both the SNF2h and hACF preparations were able to efficiently create access to the PstI site on this template, with the hACF preparation displaying 3-fold higher activity compared with the SNF2h preparation (Fig. 1C). SNF2h and hACF Remodeling Requires Different Lengths of Nucleosomal DNA Overhang—We compared the ability of SNF2h and hACF to remodel a series of defined substrates. SNF2h is unable to open a PstI site located at position 50 of mononucleosomes (158 bp) that lack a long DNA overhang (32Aalfs J.D. Narlikar G.J. Kingston R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34270-34278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but it can open this site in substrates with a 55-bp overhang (33Fan H.-Y. He X. Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1311-1322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition, ISWI-based remodelers from various organisms can reposition nucleosomes on substrates whose templates are longer than those of the core mononucleosome (11Poot R.A. Dellaire G.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3049-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These previous results indicated that the nucleosomal DNA overhang might be essential for remodeling by SNF2h and hACF, prompting us to examine this issue using a wide variety of substrates. A crucial role for a DNA overhang in SNF2h and hACF remodeling might be due to any of the following mutually compatible possibilities. 1) The DNA overhang might be required as a place to reposition the remodeled nucleosome; 2) it might enhance the productive binding of remodelers to substrate; and 3) it might increase the efficiency of SNF2h and hACF in hydrolyzing ATP. To test the above possibilities and to compare the impact of overhang length on SNF2h and hACF remodeling, we used templates based upon the 601 nucleosome positioning sequence (49Lowary P.T. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 19-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). This template produces a defined nucleosome position, as measured by micrococcal nuclease mapping, with each of the different DNA overhang lengths and engineered restriction sites used in this study (supplemental Fig. 1). We initially characterized the impact of overhang length on remodeling using native gel electrophoresis. Templates with 20-, 45-, 91-, and 120-bp overhangs (referred to as C20, C45, C91, and C120, respectively) were all visibly remodeled by SNF2h and hACF in an ATP-dependent manner as measured using this protocol (Fig. 1D). The remodeled species created on the C45 template was similar for both preparations and had a mobility consistent with a centrally localized nucleosome. Despite the limited potential for change in mobility of the smallest C20 template, we observed a slightly slower mobility of this fragment following SNF2h and hACF remodeling that was also consistent with movement to a central position (Fig. 1D). Remodeling with both proteins on the C91 and C120 templates also moved the nucleosome away from an end po"
https://openalex.org/W2161095739,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a powerful vasoconstrictor, is involved in vasospastic diseases such as coronary artery disease and subarachnoidal hemorrhage, as well as in renal and cardiovascular fibrotic remodeling. Transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mediates ET-1 signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and isolated arteries. Moreover, EGFR is required for a full constrictive response to ET-1. However, the relevant mechanisms mediating EGFR transactivation in response to ET-1 have not been identified. The present study used isolated arteries and VSMCs to investigate the role of the EGFR ligand heparin binding-epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) in ET-1-induced transactivation of EGFR, intracellular calcium mobilization, and VSMCs contraction. While baseline blood pressures were similar in HB-EGF-deficient and in wild-type littermate mice, the vasoconstrictor actions of ET-1 were attenuated in HB-EGF-/- animals. In isolated mouse carotid artery segments mounted in an arteriograph, ET-1 caused only a weak increase in isovolumetric tone in HB-EGF-deficient vessels, and this effect was mimicked by inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in wild-type arteries with or without endothelium, indicating a specific role in VSMCs. EGFR or PI3K inhibitors had no effect on KCl-induced contraction, which was normal in HB-EGF-deficient mice. To confirm that the abnormal responses in HB-EGF-deficient mice were due to impaired EGFR signaling, we studied VSMCs from waved-2 (wa2) mice; these animals have a mutation causing a partial loss of function of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity. The ET-1-induced calcium peak was reduced by 30% in VSMCs from wa2 mice and from HB-EGF-/- mice. This effect was reproduced by preincubation of wild-type VSMCs with EGFR inhibitor AG1478 and PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin. ProHB-EGF is bound to the cell membrane and released after cleavage by metalloproteinases; its action may contribute to effects of GPCR agonists on cell growth. Pretreatment of mouse VSMCs with batimastat, a metalloproteinase inhibitor, significantly attenuated ET-1-induced [Ca(2+)](i) response in wild-type cells. Human proHB-EGF has been shown to be the endogenous receptor for Corynebacterium diphteriae toxin (DT). Mutated DT toxin (CRM197) is devoid of toxicity but it neutralizes HB-EGF binding to EGFR. Pretreatment of human VSMCs from internal mammary arteries with CRM197 significantly blunted ET-1-stimulated calcium transients. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the mechanism of ET-1-induced vasoconstriction involves HB-EGF-mediated transactivation of the EGFR. This functional cascade requires modulation of agonist-induced calcium transient by EGFR and PI3K with extremely fast kinetics, suggesting a novel paradigm for GPCR-mediated calcium signaling, which may offer future therapeutic targets."

Hamon Y. Chimini G. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1007-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The range of substrates they transport varies from ions and small organic molecules to lipids, carbohydrates, and even whole proteins. In humans, they are associated with cystic fibrosis and several other genetic disorders as well as resistance to drug therapy (2Borst P. Elferink R.O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). Selective uptake and efflux by ABC transporters is driven against concentration gradients using energy derived from the binding and hydrolysis of ATP. All ABC transporters consequently have an ATP-binding subunit whose sequence and structure is relatively well conserved, with sequence identities of these nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) in the range of 25-30% across the entire superfamily (3Higgins C.F. Hiles I.D. Salmond G.P.C. Gill D.R. Downie J.A. Evans I.J. Holland I.B. Gray L. Buckel S.D. Bell A.W. Hermodson M.A. Nature. 1986; 323: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 4Hyde S.C.

Together with the two NBDs, functional ABC transporters also typically have two transmembrane domains (TMDs). These have a more variable sequence, consistent with their role as the passageway for the many different kinds of substrates that ABC transporters transport. The mechanism of energy transduction in ABC transporters is not exactly understood. Experimental evidence indicates that the catalytic cycle of ABC transporters in general involves ATPdriven association and dissociation of the NBDs (5Liu R. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11865-11873Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 6Chen J. Sharma S. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), which have two ATP-binding and hydrolysis sites. ATP binding in ABC transporters may proceed in two steps (7Chen J. Lu G. Lin J. Davidson A.L. Quiocho F.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The first step is the diffusion and binding of ATP to the core subdomain that hosts the Walker A motif. The second step is the closure of the NBDs leading to the formation of a dimer in which ATP is sandwiched between the Walker A and the signature motifs. This general sequence of events is supported by the fact that there are several crystal structures of monomeric NBDs (e.g. HisP) with ATP bound to the core subdomain (8Hung L.W. Wang I.X.Y. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F.L. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) but none with ATP bound only to the signature motif. However, the details of this process and in particular the interaction between the two ATP-binding sites and the interaction between the NBDs and the TMDs remain unclear. A number of crystal structures of dimeric NBDs (MJ0796, BtuCD, MalK, CysA, HlyB, and MsbA) have recently been reported (7Chen J. Lu G. Lin J. Davidson A.L. Quiocho F.A. Mol.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In this study, we focus on the maltose transporter. The maltose transporter complex, MalFGK2, is composed of two TMDs (MalF and MalG) and two NBDs (MalK2). MalK is the only ABC transporter NBD that has been structurally characterized by x-ray crystallography as a physiological dimer with and without bound ATP (7Chen J. Lu G. Lin J. Davidson A.L. Quiocho F.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), which makes it particularly interesting for understanding the interactions between NBDs. More recently, the structure of a MgADP-bound, presumably posthydrolysis dimer of MalK has also been reported (13Lu G. Westbrooks J.M. Davidson A.L. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17969-17974Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although crystal structures of open, semiopen, and closed forms of MalK exist, these are essentially static snapshots. In this study, we use molecular dynamics simulations, starting from the different crystal structures, to investigate the interactions between the MalK NBDs and MgATP in a realistic environment by simulating the motions of the proteins, water, and MgATP. The utility of simulation studies in elucidating the mechanism of biological macromolecules has been discussed in a number of reviews (14Ash W.L. Zlomislic M.R. Oloo E.O. Tieleman D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1666: 158-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 15Hansson T. Oostenbrink C. van Gunsteren W. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Molecular dynamics simulations give insight into dynamic properties of biomolecules, and can be used to investigate pathways between different states of a system, such as the different experimental structures of MalK. Because they are carried out in solution with all solvent and ions present, they are not constrained by crystal lattice contacts, and they can clearly follow the motions of water molecules and small cofactors, such as Mg2+, which are often not visible in crystal structures. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations provide some hope that different states of a protein can be modeled and investigated based on a single crystal structure, which is of particular interest for ABC transporters where there is, for example, a single structure of the vitamin B12 importer BtuCD (9Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar) in an unknown state in the overall transport process. We investigate the effect of docked MgATP on the conformational state of open and semiopen MalK, focusing on two key questions. 1) Can the introduction of MgATP into the binding sites transform the open and semiopen dimeric configurations into the closed? 2) Can we identify features of the NBDs and MgATP that drive closure? We discuss the simulation results in the context of NBD-NBD interactions as well as their possible relevance for the mechanism of energy coupling to the TMDs. In addition to these general aspects of ABC transporter mechanism, MalK is of interest because of its regulatory roles. It contains a regulatory domain that interacts with enzyme IIAglc, a glucose-specific permease in the sugar-transporting phosphotransferase system (17Dean D.A. Reizer J. Nikaido H. Saier M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21005-21010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kuhnau S. Reyes M. Sievertsen A. Shuman H.A. Boos W. J.

Simulations of the interactions between the two NBDs also give some insights that are relevant for understanding the structural basis of these regulatory roles. The starting structures for the simulations were the structures of MalK from Escherichia coli in three different dimeric configurations: closed (1Q12), semiopen (1Q1B), and open (1Q1E) (7Chen J. Lu G. Lin J. Davidson A.L. Quiocho F.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The closed form was crystallized with ATP bound at each of its two active sites, whereas the open and semiopen forms were nucleotide-free. In addition, simulations in which MgATP was docked into the active sites of the open and semiopen conformations were performed. Docking of MgATP was performed as previously described (22Oloo E.O. Tieleman D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45013-45019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To enhance sampling and increase the statistical accuracy of the simulations, five copies of each set-up were simulated with different random initial velocities. We also investigated the effects of removing the regulatory domains in order to determine what influence they may have on the association and dissociation of the NBDs. Residues 236-370, which constitute the regulatory domain (RD), were deleted from each of the three crystal forms. All starting structures were solvated with Simple Point Charge water molecules (23Hermans J. Berendsen H.J.C. Vangunsteren W.F. Postma J.P.M. Biopolymers. 1984; 23: 1513-1518Crossref Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Random water molecules were replaced with Na+ and Cl- ions to neutralize charge in the system and to emulate physiological conditions by raising the salt concentration to 150 mm NaCl. The production runs were 15 ns long. They were preceded by a short equilibration run of 240 ps with protein atoms restrained. As an example of a typical system size, the simulation box for MgATP-bound MalK measured 11 × 11 × 11 nm, containing 40,081 water molecules, 121 Na+ ions, and 109 Cl- ions in addition to the protein and nucleotides. The total number of atoms in this system was 127,765. Electrostatic interactions were evaluated using the Particle-Mesh Ewald method (24Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem.

Theoretical B-factors were calculated as follows, B = (8π2/3) × RMSF2, where RMSF represents the root mean square fluctuation of an atomic position during the simulations, and B is the B-factor.

Mobile Regions—To investigate the mobility of individual MalK residues in the ATP-bound closed conformation relative to the nucleotide-free open conformation, we compared open/closed B-factor ratios calculated from the simulations with experimental B-factor ratios obtained from the crystal structures. For C-α atoms, the minimum, maximum, mean, and S.D. values of crystallographic B-factors were 12.2, 87.0, 40.3, and 16.8 Å2, respectively, for the open conformation, whereas those for the closed conformation were 33.7, 148.9, 70.1, and 23.9 Å2, respectively. Corresponding minimum, maximum, mean, and S.D. values of simulation B-factors were 17.7, 850.5, 145.4, and 129.3 Å2, respectively, for the open conformation, whereas respective values for the closed dimer were 10.1, 384.8, 60.6, and 46.1 Å2. The open/closed B-factor ratios are mapped onto colorcoded ribbon diagram representations of the protein in Fig. 1. Fig. 1, A and B, shows the B-factor ratios from x-ray crystallographic data, whereas Fig. 1, C and D, show results obtained from simulation. The red regions highlight segments of the protein whose B-factors were greater in the open conformation than in the closed. Conversely, the blue regions had higher B-factors in the closed form than in the open conformation. Fig. 1 thus identifies red and blue segments as regions exhibiting the highest differences in mobility between the two configurations. Fig. 1, A and C, indicate that regions with higher mobility in the open conformation than in the closed form (red) are pre-dominantly located within the nucleotide binding domains. Most regions within the regulatory domain had about the same mobility in both states (green) or higher mobility in the closed state relative to the open (blue). Some local differences were also observed. A comparison of Fig. 1, A and B, with Fig. 1, C and D, shows that the simulation study reveals more flexibility in the NBDs than indicated by the experimental analysis. Calculated B-factor ratios from the simulation are particularly high for the two helices C-terminal to the Q-loop in the helical subdomain of one of the two NBDs. Residues in this segment are predicted to interact with the transmembrane subunits. A summary of residues in the protein that register very high or very low B-factor ratios is provided in Table 1. As indicated in Table 1, both experimental and simulation B-factor analyses identified the loop between strand S7 and helix H6 as highly mobile in the open conformation compared with the closed. In addition, the calculated B-factors also identified the segments containing the Walker A motif and the signature sequence as highly mobile in the nucleotide-free open conformation. Both sequences are involved in ATP binding in the closed MalK dimer, restricting their mobility when ATP is bound.TABLE 1Summary of regions with the highest and lowest B-factor ratiosResidue numbersDescription of segmentaSecondary structure elements are numbered sequentially in the order presented in Refs. 7 and 53.Conformation showing significantly enhanced flexibilityb“Closed” or “Open” in boldface type indicates that the segment shows the same B-factor behavior in both monomeric units, whereas normal type indicates that the result applies for one of the two monomers.

Open table in a new tab Both experiment and simulation indicate that the interface between the NBDs and the RDs is more mobile in the closed conformation than in the open. These include helices H8 and H9 at the C-terminal end of the NBD. Crystallographic analysis suggests that the loop between H3 and H4 is more mobile in the closed conformation, but simulations suggest enhanced mobility in the open form. Examination of crystal lattice interactions indicated that this region is involved in crystal contacts in the open dimer. These contacts are not present in our simulation. Inside the RD, both simulation and experiment generally reveal heightened mobility in the closed conformation relative to the open. Residues predicted to interact with MalT have been identified in some of the regions highlighted in Table 1. These are Ala250, Ile251, Trp267, and Leu268 (37Bohm A. Diez J. Diederichs K. Welte W.

Transition toward a Closed Dimer—To investigate the transition from the open and semiopen crystal structure conformations to the closed conformation, we docked a MgATP molecule into each active site of the protein. Fig. 2 shows representative snapshots of the starting and final (15 ns) conformations obtained from the simulations. Also shown are the separation distances between the Walker A motif and the signature motif across the dimer interface. Without MgATP, the semiopen starting conformation shown in Fig. 2A transitioned to the slightly more open conformation shown in Fig. 2B, with an increase in separation distance of 3 Å at both binding sites after 15 ns (Fig. 2C). In the presence of docked MgATP, however, all five copies of the semiopen starting conformation (Fig. 2D) evolved to a closed conformation (Fig. 2E). Considering backbone atoms for all of the 734 residues in the NBDs plus the RDs, the calculated r.m.s. deviation between the structure shown in Fig. 2E and the closed crystal conformation was 2.9 Å. Trends observed for the open crystal structure conformation were similar to those of the semiopen form. In the absence of MgATP, the open form (Fig. 2G) transitioned to an even more open state as shown in Fig. 2H. On the other hand, the presence of docked MgATP induced the open form (Fig. 2J) to adopt a semiopen conformation (Fig. 2K) after 15 ns in three of five simulations. The backbone r.m.s. deviation of the structure in Fig. 2K is 4.8 Å relative to the semiopen crystal conformation and 6.5 Å relative to the closed crystal conformation. It is evident, from these r.m.s. deviation values and from the final configuration presented in Fig. 2K, that despite the presence of MgATP, 15 ns was not sufficient time for the open conformation to evolve to the fully closed conformation as characterized by x-ray crystallography. At both active sites, however, the ATP molecule advanced closer to the signature motif of the opposing monomer, as shown in Fig. 2L. Movie clips of the four transitions described in Fig. 2 are included as supplemental material. Although all five copies of the semiopen simulation with docked MgATP molecules evolved to a closed conformation, as judged by the decrease in distance between centers of mass of the NBDs, analyses of the separation distance between the Walker A and the signature motif at the two active sites revealed some differences. In two simulations, this gap converged to the same value at both sites. The final separation distance at both sites was ∼8.5 Å in the first simulation and ∼10 Å in the second. The former, in particular, was in very good agreement with the experimental closed structure in which the equivalent distance was also determined to be 8.5 Å at both binding sites. The rest of the simulations of the semiopen form with docked MgATP all had one-site converge to a steady distance of 9 or 10 Å within the first 5 ns of simulation. In contrast, the separation distance at the second binding site was larger and constantly fluctuated during the 15-ns simulation time. The final distance at this site ranged between 12 and 15 Å. In simulations with the regulatory domains removed, the orientation of the two NBDs relative to each other was severely disrupted in the open and semiopen nucleotide-free dimers in the absence of MgATP (details not shown). The closed dimer with bound MgATP was, however, stable on the time scale of the simulation. Specific Interactions between NBDs—We analyzed the trajectories of the MgATP-induced transition of dimeric MalK from the open to the semiopen and the semiopen to the closed state to identify residues that are involved in closure. Simulations of the open form with docked MgATP revealed cross-interface protein-protein contacts not observed in the crystal structure. After modeling hydrogen atom coordinates by geometry into the Protein Data Bank files, two direct protein-protein hydrogen bond contacts between NBD1 and NBD2 were identified in the open crystal structure. Both of these were between His192 and Asp165. In addition to these, all simulations of the open dimer revealed cross-interface hydrogen bond interactions between the D-loops in each NBD, including Asn163-Asp165 (most common), Asn163-Asn163, and Leu164-Asp165. The MgATP molecules docked onto the Walker A motif of the open form did not advance close enough to be involved in hydrogen bond contacts across the dimer interface. However, in the absence of docked MgATP, the open dimer became even more open, as shown in Fig. 2, G and H. It is apparent, therefore, that attractive forces due to MgATP are at play, even without direct interaction. Fig. 3A shows the crystal structure conformation of semio-pen MalK (rendered in color) fit onto the closed crystal structure (white ribbon). The distance between the centers of mass of the NBDs of the semiopen crystal form was determined to be 33.3 Å. After 15 ns of simulation in the presence of docked MgATP, this distance decreased to 28.1 ± 0.2, 30.3 ± 0.4, 29.2 ± 0.2, 29.7 ± 0.1, and 31.2 ± 0.3 Å, respectively, in each of the five copies of the semiopen form simulated (averaged over the last 2 ns). These values are close to the equivalent NBD to NBD distance of 28.1 Å in the closed crystal structure. A fit of the closed conformation determined by x-ray crystallography and one derived from the semiopen form by molecular dynamics simulation is shown in Fig. 3B (r.m.s. deviation of 2.9 Å). Our simulations suggest that the MgATP-driven closure of semiopen MalK is initiated by favorable contacts across the dimer interface that mainly involve the γ-phosphate and the signature motif. However, direct protein-protein interactions between the D-loop and the Walker A motif also appear to play a key role. The sequence of structures presented in Fig. 3, C-F, highlights changes at the interface between the NBDs during one simulation of semiopen MalK with docked MgATP. At the beginning of the simulation, the two NBDs are separated by a large volume of solvent water molecules (Fig. 3C). These were added to the simulation box at the outset in order to mimic the aqueous cellular environment of MalK. For clarity, only water molecules within a 5-Å radius of MgATP are shown in subsequent panels. No direct protein-protein hydrogen bonds were observed between the NBDs of the semiopen crystal structure. At time 0.5 ns during the simulation, a direct protein-protein contact across the dimer interface was observed in the form of a hydrogen bond between Ser38 of the Walker A motif and Asp165 of the D-loop (Fig. 3D). The γ-phosphate of ATP also formed a direct hydrogen bond with Gly137 and a water-mediated hydrogen bond with Gln138. Both residues are located in the signature motif. The snapshot at 2.5 ns (Fig. 3E) confirms the involvement of the same set of conserved residues in hy"
https://openalex.org/W2072257415,"We have shown that DNA oligonucleotides substantially homologous to the telomere 3-prime overhang sequence (T-oligos) increase DNA repair capacity (DRC) in cultured human cells and decrease UV-induced mutation rate and photocarcinogenesis in mouse skin. To investigate the protective effects of T-oligos in intact human skin, paired skin explants obtained from adult donors were treated with T-oligos or diluent alone for 24 h, then UVB- or sham-irradiated, and processed after 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h for histological analysis. After UV irradiation apoptotic epidermal cells were comparable in diluent- and T-oligo-treated skin. Proliferating (Ki67+) cells were sparse in sham-irradiated skin and for 24 h after UV in both diluent- and T-oligo-treated specimens. However, compared to diluent controls, at 48 and 72 h T-oligos significantly inhibited UV-induced rebound hyperproliferation. Maximum and comparable cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) were detected immediately after UV irradiation in diluent- and T-oligo-treated skin, but CPDs were strikingly reduced in T-oligo- vs. diluent-treated skin at 24, 48, and 72 h. Total and activated p53 protein was increased in T-oligo- vs. diluent-pretreated skin at the time of irradiation, and up to 3-fold increases persisted for 24 h post-UV. Over 5 days, UV irradiation and T-oligo comparably increased expression of melanogenic proteins and each increased epidermal melanin content 3- to 5-fold, with distinct nuclear capping in many keratinocytes. In combination, these findings predict that T-oligo treatment will increase melanogenesis, prolong epidermal arrest, and increase DNA repair rate after UV irradiation, thus decreasing the severity of acute and chronic photodamage in human skin. Moreover, the data document an inducible SOS-like response consisting of increased melanogenesis and increased DNA repair capacity in human skin following UV-induced damage that is also produced by T-oligos in the absence of initial damage."

https://openalex.org/W2070920270,"The role of the transcriptional coactivator p300 in cell cycle control has not been analysed in detail due to the lack of appropriate experimental systems. We have now examined cell cycle progression of p300-deficient cancer cell lines, where p300 was disrupted either by gene targeting (p300− cells) or knocked down using RNAi. Despite significant proliferation defects under normal growth conditions, p300-deficient cells progressed rapidly through G1 with premature S-phase entry. Accelerated G1/S transition was associated with early retinoblastoma (RB) hyperphosphorylation and activation of E2F targets. The p300-acetylase activity was dispensable since expression of a HAT-deficient p300 mutant reversed these changes. Co-immunoprecipitation showed p300/RB interaction occurs in vivo during G1, and this interaction has two peaks: in early G1 with unphosphorylated RB and in late G1 with phosphorylated RB. In vitro kinase assays showed that p300 directly inhibits cdk6-mediated RB phosphorylation, suggesting p300 acts in early G1 to prevent RB hyperphosphorylation and delay premature S-phase entry. Paradoxically, continued cycling of p300− cells despite prolonged serum depletion was observed, and this occurred in association with persistent RB hyperphosphorylation. Altogether, these results suggest that p300 has an important role in G1/S control, possibly by modulating RB phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1977789926,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase in the insulin receptor superfamily. We recently demonstrated that the growth factors pleiotrophin (PTN) and midkine (MK) are ligands for ALK and that upon ALK activation, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and other substrates are phosphorylated. Here, the role of IRS-1 in ligand-mediated ALK signaling is investigated in interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent 32D murine myeloid cells. These cells do not express ALK and IRS family members, and do not respond to exogenously added PTN or MK. We show that expression of ALK plus IRS-1 renders these cells independent of IL-3 owing to the activation of ALK by endogenous MK. Mutational analysis reveals that this transformed phenotype of 32D cells requires kinase-active ALK as well as the interaction of ALK with IRS-1. Furthermore, 32D/IRS-1/ALK cells display an enhanced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and PI3-kinase pathways, and a selective transcriptional activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the endogenous MK or p65/NF-kappaB revealed that both these are rate limiting for the transformed phenotype induced by ALK plus IRS-1. We conclude that the recruitment of IRS-1 to activated ALK and the activation of NF-kappaB are essential for the autocrine growth and survival signaling of MK."
https://openalex.org/W2074037055,"We have followed at high resolution the ribosomal protein S6 entering the nucleus of HeLa cells, stopping in some (not all) interchromatin granules clusters and reaching, via Cajal bodies, the nucleolus. There, S6 is assembled with other proteins and rRNA into small ribosomal subunit (SSU), released in the nucleoplasm, and exported through the nuclear pores. We show for the first time the spatial association of nuclear myosin I (NMI) and actin with the SSU already at the nucleolar periphery to the nuclear pore. A blockade of NMI or actin induces an upstream accumulation of the S6 protein en route to the nucleolus, and a temperature lower than normal influences RNA export. Our data strongly suggest a functional relationship of SSU with NMI and actin. In our hypothesis, an active, myosin-driven movement of the small ribosomal subunit can be responsible for the export of approximately 10% of SSUs. This hypothesis is supported by ultrastructural, immunofluorescence, and biochemical analyses. The currently accepted model for the subunit release suggests a diffusive, temperature-independent mechanism. However, the advantage of the double mechanism would assure that the movement of a part of the subunits could be modulated, increased, or decreased according to the needs of the cell at a specific moment in the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2110551282,"The PDZ proteins such as hDLG, hScrib and MAGIs function as the membrane-associated protein scaffolds and have been shown to interact with the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6s. In this report, we identify a Golgi-associated PDZ protein, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator-associated ligand (CAL) as a cellular target of HPV16 E6 by the proteomic approach. The carboxy-terminal PDZ-binding motif of HPV16 E6 specifically interacts with the PDZ domain of CAL, and the interaction enhances proteasome-mediated degradation of CAL. HPV16 E6 interacts with CAL more strongly and degrades it better than HPV18 E6 owing to the more compatible PDZ-binding motif. CAL is ubiquitinated by the E6/E6-associated protein (E6AP) complex or by E6AP alone, albeit less efficiently, which indicates that it could be a normal target of E6AP. Although it downregulates CAL at the transcript level, small interfering RNA-induced depletion of HPV16 E6 in Caski cells stabilizes CAL at the protein level, suggesting that HPV16 E6 mediates the proteasomal degradation of CAL in HPV-positive cervical cancer cells. HPV16 E6 may tightly regulate the vesicular trafficking processes by interacting with CAL, and such a modification can contribute to the development of cervical cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1966928253,"Medulloblastoma (MB) results from aberrant development of cerebellar neurons in which altered hedgehog (Hh) signalling plays a major role. We investigated the possible influence of Hh signalling on ErbB-receptor expression in MB, in particular that of the ErbB-4 CYT-1 and CYT-2 isoforms generated by alternative splicing of the cytoplasmic domain. ErbB-4 expression was downregulated in Hh-induced MBs from Patched-1+/− mice. Hh signalling (reflected by enhanced expression of the Gli1 transcription factor) inhibited ErbB-4 expression in mouse cerebellar granule progenitors and human MB cells. Analysis of 26 human primary MBs revealed a subset of 11 tumors characterized by low Gli1 levels, upregulated ErbB-4 expression and increased CYT-1:CYT-2 ratios. Interestingly, CYT-1 and Gli1 levels were inversely correlated. ErbB-4 CYT-1 and CYT-2 had different phenotypic effects in cultured MB cells: in response to neuregulin treatment, CYT-2 overexpression inhibited proliferation whereas CYT-1, which includes a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-binding site that is missing in CYT-2, enhanced resistance to starvation- and etoposide-induced apoptosis by activating PI3K/Akt signalling. CYT-1:CYT-2 ratios displayed correlation with tumor histotype and ErbB-2 levels, which are established prognostic indices for MB. These findings demonstrate that low-level Hh signalling in human MB is associated with the selective maintenance of high ErbB-4 CYT-1 expression, an alteration that exerts tumor-promoting effects."

They include spermidine-preferential and putrescine-specific uptake systems, which belong to the family of ATP-binding cassette transporters, and a protein, PotE, involved in the excretion of putrescine by a putrescine-ornithine antiporter activity. Furthermore, it has been reported that cadaverine and aminopropylcadaverine function as compensatory polyamines for cell growth (10Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Hamasaki H. Miura A. Kakegawa T. Hirose S. Matsuzaki S. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and CadB, a cadaverine-lysine antiporter, is strongly involved in cell growth at acidic pH like PotE (11Neely M.N. Olson E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5522-5528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Soksawatmaekhin W. Kuraishi A. Sakata K. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1401-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Analogous to the speF-potE operon (13Kashiwagi K. Suzuki T. Suzuki F. Furuchi T. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20922-20927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cadB is one component of the cadBA operon, in which cadA encodes lysine decarboxylase (14Meng S.Y. Bennett G.N. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2659-2669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Watson N. Dunyak D.S. Rosey E.L. Slonczewski J.L. Olson E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 530-540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the cadBA operon is regulated by a positive regulator CadC, which is encoded by adjacent cadC gene (14Meng S.Y. Bennett G.N. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2659-2669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Watson N. Dunyak D.S. Rosey E.L. Slonczewski J.L. Olson E.R. J.

The cadBA and speF-potE operons contribute to an increase in pH of the extracellular medium through excretion of cadaverine and putrescine, the consumption of a proton, and a supply of carbon dioxide during the decarboxylation reaction (12Soksawatmaekhin W. Kuraishi A. Sakata K. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1401-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 16Takayama M. Ohyama T. Igarashi K. Kobayashi H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) so that expression of these two operons is important for cell growth at acidic pH. It is also shown that expression of the speF-potE operon is increased when the cadBA operon is not induced (12Soksawatmaekhin W. Kuraishi A. Sakata K. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1401-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Other antiport systems for basic amino acids and their amine products (histidine/histamine and arginine/agmatine), coupled with decarboxylation, have been reported to generate a proton motive force in Lactobacillus buchneri and E. coli (17Molenaar D. Bosscher J.S. ten Brink B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2864-2870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Gong S. Richard H. Foster J.W. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4402-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). At neutral pH, both CadB and PotE have cadaverine and putrescine uptake activity and contribute to cell growth of a polyamine-requiring mutant MA261 (12Soksawatmaekhin W. Kuraishi A. Sakata K.

Igarashi K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1401-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), the structure of CadB is not well understood. When homology between the amino acid sequences of CadB and PotE was compared, high sequence similarity was observed (30.7% overall identity) (12Soksawatmaekhin W. Kuraishi A. Sakata K. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1401-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We have previously identified amino acid residues involved in putrescine uptake and excretion by PotE (8Kashiwagi K. Kuraishi A. Tomitori H. Igarashi A. Nishimura K. Shirahata A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36007-36012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified a likely cadaverine recognition site on CadB based on the information concerning putrescine recognition by PotE.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid and Site-directed Mutagenesis of cadB Gene—Plasmid pMWcadB was prepared using pMW119 (Nippon Gene Co.) as described previously (12Soksawatmaekhin W. Kuraishi A. Sakata K. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1401-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of cadB gene was carried out with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using a Seq 4 × 4 personal sequencing system (Amersham Biosciences) or CEQ8000 DNA genetic analysis system (Beckman Coulter). A list of oligonucleotide primers for mutagenesis has not been included but is available from the authors upon request. pUCcadB was constructed by inserting 1.5 kbp BamHI and EcoRI fragments of pMWcadB into the same restriction sites of pUC119 (Takara Shuzo Co.).Culture Conditions—E. coli JM109 (recA1 supE44 endA1 gyrA96 relA1 thi Δ (lac-proAB)/F′ (traD36 proAB+ lacIq lacZΔM15)) (19Sambrook J.

Igarashi K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3131-3135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and/or kanamycin (50 μg/ml) were added to the medium, if necessary. Where indicated, 0.2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the medium.Cadaverine Uptake by Intact Cells—E. coli JM109/pMW119 or JM109/pMWcadB cultured until A540 = 0.5 in the presence of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) 2The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide. was suspended in buffer I containing 0.4% glucose, 62 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1.7 mm sodium citrate, 7.6 mm (NH4)2SO4, and 0.41 mm MgSO4 to yield a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The cell suspension (0.48 ml) was preincubated at 30 °C for 5 min, and the reaction was started by the addition of 0.02 ml of 0.25 mm [14C]cadaverine (370 MBq/mmol, Sigma). Thus, the concentration of [14C]cadaverine in the reaction mixture was 10 μm. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 s to 3 min, the cells were collected on cellulose acetate filters (0.45 μm; Advantec Toyo Co.), and the filters were washed three times with a total of 9 ml of buffer I. To determine the Km values of cadaverine for cadaverine uptake activity of cadB mutants, 10-200 μm cadaverine was used as a substrate. The radioactivity on the filters was measured with a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Protein content was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Preparation of Inside-out Membrane Vesicles and Cadaverine Uptake by the Vesicles—Cadaverine-lysine antiport activity by CadB was estimated by measuring cadaverine uptake by inside-out membrane vesicles prepared according to the method of Houng et al. (22Houng H.S. Lynn A.R. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli JM109/pMWcadB cells were cultured until A540 = 0.5 in the presence of 0.5 mm IPTG. Inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared by French press treatment (10,000 p.s.i.) of the cells suspended in a buffer containing 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.6, 10 mm EDTA in the presence of 2.5 mm lysine (23Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Suzuki F. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4529-4533Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). After removal of unbroken cells and cell debris, membrane vesicles were collected by ultracentrifugation (170,000 × g, 1 h). Membrane vesicles were washed with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.14 m KCl, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, collected by ultracentrifugation, and suspended in the same buffer at the protein concentration of 5-10 mg/ml. The reaction mixture (0.1 ml) for the uptake by inside-out membrane vesicles contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.14 m KCl, 100 μm [14C]cadaverine (1.48 GBq/mmol), and 100 μg of inside-out membrane vesicle protein. After incubation at 22 °C for 10 s to 1 min, membrane vesicles were collected on cellulose nitrate filters (0.45 μm; Advantec Toyo Co.) and washed twice with a total of 9 ml of washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.14 m KCl). To determine the Km values of cadaverine for cadaverine-lysine antiport activity of cadB mutants, 100-2000 μm cadaverine was used as a substrate. Radioactivity on the filters was measured with a liquid scintillation spectrometer.Western Blot Analysis of CadB Protein—Rabbit antibody for the CadB protein was prepared according to the method of Posnett et al. (24Posnett D.N. McGrath H. Tam J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1719-1725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the multiple antigenic peptide, KVY-GEVDSNGIPKK, which correspond to amino acids 308-321 of the CadB protein. For Western blot analysis of CadB, inside-out membrane vesicles (30 μg protein) were separated by SDS-poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 12% acrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore). CadB protein was detected with ProtoBlot Western blot AP System (Promega), except that 0.2% Triton X-100 was used instead of 0.05% Tween 20 (25Nielsen P.J. Manchester K.L. Towbin H. Gordon J. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12316-12321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Reactivity of [14C]NEM ([ethyl-1-14C]N-Ethylmaleimide) with CadB Protein—E. coli JM109/pUCcadB cells were cultured until A540 = 0.5 in a 19-amino acid supplemented medium containing 1% glycerol and 0.5 mm IPTG with or without 0.2 mm 2-mecaptoethanol. Right-side-out membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously (26Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 972-977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactivity of [14C]NEM with CadB was tested according to the method of Sahin-Tóth et al. (27Sahin-Tóth M. Gunawan P. Lawrence M.C. Toyokuni T. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13039-13045Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Right-side-out membrane vesicles (200 μg protein) were suspended with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, in a final volume of 50 μl, and 10 μl of 2.4 mm [14C]NEM (2.1 GBq/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc.) was added. Incubation was carried out at 22 °C for 10 min. Reactions were terminated by adding 1.8 μl of 1 m dithiothreitol (final: 30 mm), and the vesicles were solubilized by adding 15 μl of 10% dodecyl β-d-maltoside. CadB was then precipitated with 50 μl of anti-CadB serum and 20 μg of PANSORBIN® cells (Calbiochem). Cells were washed three times with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.02% dodecyl β-d-maltoside. Cells were suspended in 40 μl of SDS sample buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.05% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 4 min. After centrifugation, a 30-μl aliquot was subjected to SDS-poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis on an 8.5% acrylamide gel. Incorporation of [14C]NEM into CadB was visualized by BAS2000 II imaging analyzer (Fuji Film).Analysis of Hydropathy and Sequence Homology of Proteins—Average hydropathy profiles of the proteins were obtained according to the method of Kyte and Doolittle (28Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17009) Google Scholar) with a hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity plot (GENETYX-MAC Version 10, GENETYX Co.). A model of the secondary structure of proteins was then constructed according to these profiles. Sequence homology of the protein was analyzed by the CLUSTALW V1.83 program (29Thompson J.D.

These residues were individually mutated to asparagine and glutamine, respectively. Cadaverine uptake activity was measured using E. coli JM109 transformed with pMW encoding wild type or mutated CadB. Cadaverine excretion (i.e. cadaverine-lysine antiporter activity) was measured by [14C]cadaverine uptake using lysine-loaded inside-out membrane vesicles prepared from E. coli JM109 transformed with pMW encoding wild type or mutated CadB. As shown in Fig. 1, both uptake and excretion were greatly decreased with the mutants E204Q and D303N and moderately with E76Q and E377Q, and only uptake was moderately decreased with D185N and E408Q. There are 11 tryptophan and 13 tyrosine residues in CadB. These residues were mutated to leucine and the activities were measured. Both uptake and excretion were strongly decreased with the mutants Y73L, Y89L, Y90L, Y235L, and Y423L and moderately with Y55L, Y246L and Y310L, and only uptake was greatly decreased with W43L, Y57L, Y107L, Y366L, and Y368L and moderately with W41L and Y174L (Fig. 1).In our previous studies of PotE, we found that cysteine residues were involved in the recognition of putrescine by PotE (8Kashiwagi K.

There are 8 cysteine residues in CadB. Each cysteine was mutated to serine, and uptake and excretion were measured. As shown in Fig. 2, both uptake and excretion were decreased significantly with the mutant C370S, and then with C397S, but mutations C12S, C125S, C196S, C282S, C389S, and C394S had no effect or only modest effects. To confirm that Cys370 is important for CadB activities, all 8 cysteine residues were replaced by serine and both uptake and excretion were measured. As shown in Fig. 3, the activities of the ΔC mutant were decreased greatly, and they were restored only with the mutant ΔC C370, which has one cysteine residue at position 370 but not with the mutants ΔC C12, C125, C196, C282, C389, C394, and C397. The results confirmed that the SH group of Cys370 is involved in both uptake and excretion.FIGURE 2Effect of Cys mutations on the cadaverine uptake and excretion activities of CadB.

To confirm the importance of these amino acid residues, Glu204 was replaced by Asp and Asp303 by Glu. As shown in Fig. 4A, replacement of Glu204 and Asp303 by Asp and Glu did not restore the activities of CadB, indicating that Glu204 and Asp303 are critical for both activities. Similarly, Tyr73, Tyr89, Tyr90, Tyr235, and Tyr423 were replaced by Phe and Trp. Replacement of Tyr73, Tyr89, and Tyr235 by Phe and Trp did not restore the activities of CadB. Replacement of Tyr90 by Phe, but not by Trp, and replacement of Tyr423 by Phe and Trp slightly restored the activities of CadB. These results also indicate that these five tyrosine residues are critical for both activities of CadB. Expression of mutated CadB proteins was examined by Western blot analysis using 30 μg of protein of inside-out membrane vesicles. Comparable amounts of mutated CadB proteins were expressed on the membranes, indicating that the mutations do not affect expression of CadB (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Cadaverine uptake and excretion activities of Glu204, Asp303, Tyr73, Tyr89, Tyr90, Tyr235 and Tyr423 mutants of CadB (A) and their expression (B).

As shown in Table 1, the Km value for uptake of cadaverine by wild-type CadB was 20.8 μm. In mutants that caused a reduction in activity, the Km value for cadaverine was increased, and the change in Km paralleled the decrease in cadaverine uptake activity shown in Figs. 1 and 2. As a control, the Km values were measured with W269L and D436N mutants, whose activities were almost the same as that of wild type. They were nearly equal to the Km value of wild type. These results indicate that all of the key mutants are at amino acid residues involved in the recognition of cadaverine. The Km value for excretion of cadaverine by CadB was 390 μm (Table 1). In CadB mutants that caused a decrease in excretion, the Km value for cadaverine was increased, in parallel with the decrease in cadaverine excretion shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Although the change in the Km value for uptake of cadaverine was greater than the change in the Km value for excretion of cadaverine for any given mutant except the mutants Y73L and Y423, the change in the Km value for uptake was parallel with that for excretion.TABLE 1The Km value of mutated CadB for cadaverine uptake and excretionMutantUptakeaAssays were performed as described in the legend of Fig. 1.ExcretionaAssays were performed as described in the legend of Fig. 1.KmbThese values were calculated from the Lineweaver-Burk plots.

Open table in a new tab For the related protein PotE, a putrescine-ornithine anti-porter, residue Lys301 in C5 (cytoplasmic loop 5) is involved in recognition of the carboxyl group of ornithine (8Kashiwagi K.

Thus, we determined whether a basic amino acid(s) in the cytoplasmic loops is involved in recognition of the carboxyl group of lysine. As shown in Fig. 5, excretion but not uptake of cadaverine was markedly reduced in R299A in C5, whereas both uptake and excretion activities were reduced to a similar, small extent in all other mutants. The results suggest that Arg299 is involved in the recognition of lysine.FIGURE 5Effect of Arg and Lys mutations on the cadaverine uptake and excretion activities of CadB. Arg and Lys located in the cytoplasmic loops were mutated to Ala. Assays were performed as described in the legend of Fig. 1. Values are the mean ± S.D. of three samples. The amino acid residues in rectangles are involved in lysine recognition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Location of Amino Acid Residues Involved in Uptake and Excretion—Average hydropathy profiles of CadB indicated that CadB consists of 12 helices like PotE. Sequence homology between CadA and PotE was 30.7% (12Soksawatmaekhin W. Kuraishi A. Sakata K. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1401-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To confirm the high sequence similarity between CadB and PotE, the multiple sequence alignments were analyzed by the CLUSTALW program (29Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55217) Google Scholar). The score between PotE and CadB was 27.3, but the scores between PotE and other proteins were less than 16. Thus, the secondary structure of CadB was constructed as shown in Fig. 6, which is similar to that of PotE. Amino acids important for both uptake and excretion were located in the transmembrane helices II, III, VI, VII, X, and XII or in the cytoplasmic region between transmembrane helices II and III (C2), VI and VII (C4), VIII and IX (C5), and X and XI (C6). Amino acid residues in the transmembrane helices are also located in the cytoplasmic side rather than the periplasmic side. In contrast to PotE, the Km value for cadaverine uptake by CadB is high (20.8 μm). Since numerous amino acid residues are involved in uptake of cadaverine, the participation of any individual residue in recognition of cadaverine may be weak. Those amino acids are mainly located in the transmembrane helices and the periplasmic loops and may be slightly separated from the substrate binding site. However, it is expected that those amino acid are located close to each other in the tertiary structure of CadB.FIGURE 6Amino acid residues involved in the activities of CadB.

https://openalex.org/W2156871627,"Signal peptide peptidase (SPP) is an intramembrane cleaving protease (I-CLiP) identified by its cleavage of several type II membrane signal peptides. To date, only human SPP has been directly shown to have proteolytic activity. Here we demonstrate that the most closely related human homologue of SPP, signal peptide peptidase like 3 (SPPL3), cleaves a SPP substrate, but a more distantly related homologue, signal peptide peptidase like 2b (SPPL2b), does not. These data provide strong evidence that the SPP and SPPL3 have conserved active sites and suggest that the active sites SPPL2b is distinct. We have also synthesized a cDNA designed to express the single SPP gene present in Plasmodium falciparum and cloned this into a mammalian expression vector. When the malaria SPP protein is expressed in mammalian cells it cleaves a SPP substrate. Notably, several human SPP inhibitors block the proteolytic activity of malarial SPP (mSPP). Studies from several model organisms that express multiple SPP homologs demonstrate that the silencing of a single SPP homologue is lethal. Based on these data, we hypothesize that mSPP is a potential a novel therapeutic target for malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2078356115,"We show that human osteosarcoma cells (Saos-2) have downregulation of alpha3beta1-integrin compared to normal bone cells; this was further described in human osteosarcomas and in a primary murine sarcoma. The alpha3 gene was silenced in Saos-2 cells causing a low expression of alpha3beta1-integrin and reduction in collagen attachment with increasing migratory capacity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay performed on alpha3 promoter established that Myc and Yin Yang protein (YY1) cooperate in tandem to downregulate the alpha3 gene. This silencing mechanism involves the binding of Myc and YY1 to DNA and formation of complexes among Myc/Max, YY1, CREB-binding protein and deacetylation activity. The promoter containing deletions of E-boxes or YY1 cassettes failed to downregulate the transcription of a reporter gene as well as the inhibition of deacetylation activity. Overexpression of both Myc and YY1 was necessary to determine the alpha3-integrin promoter downregulation in normal osteoblasts. This downregulation of alpha3beta1-integrin can contribute to the acquisition of a more aggressive phenotype. YY1 regulated negatively the Myc activity through a direct interaction with the Myc/Max and deacetylase complexes. This represents a novel silencing mechanism with broad implications in the transcription machinery of tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2158268644,"Melanin synthesized by epidermal melanocytes protects the skin against UVR-induced DNA damage and skin cancer. Exposure to UVR increases the synthesis of the photoprotective eumelanin on activation of MC1R, a melanoma susceptibility gene. We studied the expression of MC1R under UVR and alpha-MSH stimulation in skin of different ethnic origins and in melanocytes of various pigmentary levels. This study identifies and characterizes a novel MC1R isoform (MC1R350) generated by alternative splicing of the classically known MC1R (MC1R317). We demonstrate that the melanin content of melanocytes shows a significant positive correlation with MC1R317 levels but correlates inversely with the amount of MC1R350, suggesting that this latter isoform could act as a negative regulator of melanin synthesis. We confirmed that hypothesis by showing that while MC1R317 signaling significantly increases the expression of MITF and tyrosinase, two key factors in the melanin synthesis pathway, MC1R350 dramatically hampers their expression. In the skin, we show that UVR does not increase MC1R350 expression but does significantly increase MC1R317. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that MC1R350 acts as a negative regulator of skin pigmentation and demonstrate for the first time that MC1R isoform-specific expression is closely related to skin pigmentation and photoprotection."
https://openalex.org/W2163110797,"Pressure overload associated with hypertension is an important pathological factor leading to heart remodeling and ultimately heart failure partially due to cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Here we show that endogenous NO signaling plays a critical role in mechanical stretch-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Mechanical stretch induced elevated expression of both eNOS and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and increased synthesis of NO. A sustained increase in iNOS expression was also found in hearts of hypertensive rats in vivo. Blockade of NO signaling by inhibitors of NOS (L-NAME and AMT) or downstream guanylyl cyclase (ODQ) strongly inhibited stretch-induced apoptosis, mitochondria depolarization, and cytochrome c release, suggesting that NO is required in stretch-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The expression of iNOS, but not eNOS, was blocked by L-NAME and ODQ, indicating that the iNOS induction is NO dependent. The initial elevation of NO is likely due to Ca(2+)-dependent activation of eNOS because elimination of intracellular calcium by EGTA-AM inhibited both iNOS induction and NO elevation. Other calcium signaling inhibitors (nifedipine, ryanodine, thapsigargin, and ionic gadolinium) also attenuated the initial NO elevation. These data indicate that mechanical signals initiate Ca(2+)-dependent NO synthesis, which is further amplified by activation of NO-induced iNOS expression, to regulate cardiomyocyte apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2047228116,"Structure-function studies of mammalian and bacterial excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs), as well as the crystal structure of a related archaeal glutamate transporter, support a model in which TM7, TM8, and the re-entrant loops HP1 and HP2 participate in forming a substrate translocation pathway within each subunit of a trimer. However, the transport mechanism, including precise binding sites for substrates and co-transported ions and changes in the tertiary structure underlying transport, is still not known. In this study, we used chemical cross-linking of introduced cysteine pairs in a cysteine-less version of EAAT1 to examine the dynamics of key domains associated with the translocation pore. Here we show that cysteine substitution at Ala-395, Ala-367, and Ala-440 results in functional single and double cysteine transporters and that in the absence of glutamate or dl-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartate (dl-TBOA), A395C in the highly conserved TM7 can be cross-linked to A367C in HP1 and to A440C in HP2. The formation of these disulfide bonds is reversible and occurs intra-molecularly. Interestingly, cross-linking A395C to A367C appears to abolish transport, whereas cross-linking A395C to A440C lowers the affinities for glutamate and dl-TBOA but does not change the maximal transport rate. Additionally, glutamate and dl-TBOA binding prevent cross-linking in both double cysteine transporters, whereas sodium binding facilitates cross-linking in the A395C/A367C transporter. These data provide evidence that within each subunit of EAAT1, Ala-395 in TM7 resides close to a residue at the tip of each re-entrant loop (HP1 and HP2) and that these residues are repositioned relative to one another at different steps in the transport cycle. Such behavior likely reflects rearrangements in the tertiary structure of the translocation pore during transport and thus provides constraints for modeling the structural dynamics associated with transport.

Poolman B. Konings W.N. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, the transport of glutamate against its concentration gradient is driven by the co-transport of three sodium ions and a proton, and the counter transport of a potassium ion (14Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), resulting in a stoichiometric transport current. Glutamate binding to the transporter in the presence of sodium also activates an anion conductance that is not stoichiometrically coupled to transport (7Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 15Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The prokaryotic carriers use sodium and/or protons to drive the concentrative uptake of glutamate across the cell membrane, and it is not yet known whether they also mediate an anion conductance (13Lolkema J.S. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The current model of the transporter topology is based on cysteine-scanning accessibility studies of the mammalian and bacterial carriers (1Amara S.G. Fontana A.C. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 41: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 16Bridges R.J. Esslinger C.S. Pharmacol. Ther. 2005; 107: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Sobczak I.

Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). In this model, the first half of the protein appears to form six TM helices, and the second half is composed of two re-entrant loops in opposite orientations (HP1 and HP2), a seventh TM divided by a β-linker into two helices (TM7) and a final amphipathic transmembrane helix (TM8). Biochemical studies of the rat EAAT1–3 and a related bacterial transporter, GltTBsc, as well as the crystal structure indicate that the transporter exists as a trimer, although substrate binding and translocation are thought to occur within each subunit (19Gendreau S.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11913-11923Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Indeed, within each monomer of the crystal the C-terminal domains form what appears to be a pore or binding pocket for a “trapped” glutamate molecule (18Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Our current understanding of the role of the C-terminal domains in transport is based on numerous structure-function and topology studies of the mammalian and bacterial transporters. In these studies, it was determined that consecutive, conserved serine residues in HP1 are in an aqueous environment and are accessible from both sides of the membrane (23Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9684-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar– 25Slotboom D.J. Sobczak I. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14282-14287Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, the modification of cysteines substituted for each of these residues abolishes transport, supporting a model in which the residues are closely associated with the translocation pore (23Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9684-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 24Seal R.P. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G.

A. 1999; 96: 14282-14287Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Similarly, most residues in the highly conserved TM7 are also in an aqueous environment and accessible from one or both sides of the membrane (26Pines G. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17093-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Seal R.P. Amara S.G.

A. 1998; 95: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Modification of a majority of these residues, after substitution with cysteine, also abolishes transport, and A395C is protected from modification by substrates and nontransported inhibitors (27Seal R.P. Amara S.G. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1487-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Two of these residues influence the binding of co-transported ions, sodium and/or potassium (Tyr-403 and Glu-404 in Glt1), and when mutated shift the carrier from a unidirectional transport mode into an exchange mode (26Pines G. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17093-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Zarbiv R. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1703-1708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In HP2, two residues (Ser-440 and Ser-443 in Glt1) influence whether lithium can substitute for sodium to support transport (30Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and one residue appears to be accessible from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (31Grunewald M. Menaker D. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26074-26080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, most all of the residues in the C-terminal portion of HP2 form a helix and reside in an aqueous environment, near what appears to be the extracellular mouth of the pore (32Leighton B.H. Seal R.P. Shimamoto K. Amara S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29847-29855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of a cysteine introduced into HP1 to one introduced into HP2 suggested that these loops reside in close proximity to one another when the transporter is in the sodium-bound state (33Brocke L. Bendahan A. Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3985-3992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Based on this finding and on the crystal structure, the two re-entrant loops are hypothesized to act as internal (HP1) and external (HP2) gates in an alternating access model of transport (18Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 33Brocke L. Bendahan A. Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3985-3992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Finally, previous work showed that TM8 forms an amphipathic helix with one face lining an aqueous pathway (34Slotboom D.J. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10775-10781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An arginine residue at the N-terminal side of this helix (Arg-77 in Glt1) is thought to interact with the γ-carboxylate group of glutamate and to influence potassium binding (35Bendahan A. Armon A. Madani N. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37436-37442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Mutation of a second arginine (Arg-475 in Glt1) in this helix changes the substrate selectivity and transforms the carrier into a substrate-gated cation channel (36Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2513-2519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, many of the previous studies, as well as the recent crystal structure, support a model in which these C-terminal domains are directly associated with the translocation pore. To better understand how these domains are spatially oriented relative to one another during the transport cycle, we carried out a cysteine cross-linking study. We created 22 double cysteine transporters by introducing pairs of cysteine residues into C-terminal domains of a cysteine-less version of EAAT1 (27Seal R.P. Amara S.G. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1487-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and we then measured their transport activity before and after application of copper phenanthroline (CuPh), a catalyst of disulfide bond formation. We also determined the effect of cross-linking on the kinetics of transport, as well as the effects of substrates, inhibitors, and sodium ions on the extent of crosslinking. Results from this work suggest that Ala-395 in TM7 resides at a central point in the translocation pathway near a residue at the tip of each re-entrant loop, Ala-367 in HP1 and Ala-440 in HP2, and that the spatial relationship between these domains is altered during the transport cycle. Constructs and Cell Transfections—To make the cysteine substitution mutants, cysteine residues were introduced into the Cys-less-EAAT1 transporter using PCR (QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene). PCR products were subcloned into the pCMV5 vector and sequenced by dye terminator cycle sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). COS-7 cells were passaged and plated into 24-well plates and then transfected by the DEAE-dextran method. Experiments were performed 2 days post-transfection. Cys-less-EAAT1 mutant constructs were assessed for their ability to accumulate 10 μm l-[3H]glutamate (100 nm l-[3H]glutamate, 9.9 μm unlabeled l-glutamate (24 Ci/mmol)). Cells were lysed in 0.1% SDS and counted in a scintillation counter. Cells transfected with the pCMV5 vector served as a control for endogenous l-glutamate uptake under all conditions. Kinetics—Cells expressing cysteine substitution mutants or Cys-less-EAAT1 were assayed for the ability to accumulate l-glutamate (200 μm; 100 nm l-[3H]glutamate, 199.9 μm nonlabeled l-glutamate) as a function of time (6Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Uptake remained linear for 10 min. For Vmax and Km calculations, cells were incubated with 100 nml-[3H]glutamate in final unlabeled l-glutamate concentrations of 1, 3, 10, 50, 100, 300, 500, and 1000 μm for 10 min at room temperature. Endogenous l-glutamate uptake measured in cells transfected with the pCMV5 vector was subtracted from each concentration. The Cys-less-EAAT1 transport activity was typically at least 5-fold over the endogenous background activity. The Vmax is expressed as a percent of Cys-less-EAAT1. Km and Vmax values were derived by the Michaelis-Menten equation using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). CuPh-catalyzed Disulfide Cross-linking—COS-7 cells expressing Cys-less-EAAT1 or Cys-less-EAAT1 with single or double cysteine mutations were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated for 5 min at room temperature with various concentrations of copper phenanthroline (CuPh) (0.1–1.5 mm) in PBS. Prior to experimental use, CuSO4 and 1,10-phenanthroline were combined in a 1:2 ratio to produce the CuPh reagent. Cells were then washed two times with PBS plus 0.1 mm calcium chloride, 1 mm magnesium chloride (PBSCM), and transporter-mediated uptake was assayed with 10 μm l-[3H]glutamate (100 nm l-[3H]glutamate, 9.9 μm unlabeled l-glutamate (24 Ci/mmol)) in PBSCM for 10 min at room temperature. After washing twice with PBSCM, cells were dissolved in 0.1% SDS, and activity was measured by a scintillation counter. Data were plotted as a percentage of the carrier activity without CuPh-catalyzed cross-linking under the same conditions. Percent activity = 100 × uptake after/uptake before. DTT Application after CuPh Treatment—CuPh-catalyzed cross-linking was performed as described above. Cells were then washed twice with PBSCM and incubated with 20 mm dl-dithiothreitol (DTT) in PBSCM for 5 min. Cells were washed twice with PBSCM, and uptake was performed as described above. Data were plotted as a percent of transport activity measured in the absence of CuPh. CuPh Treatment without Sodium—COS-7 cells expressing mutant or Cys-less-EAAT1 transporters were washed once in choline buffer containing 138 mm choline-Cl, 8.1 mm Tris-H3PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.4). CuPh was applied at 8 or 300 μm for A395C/A440C or 300 or 700 μm for A395C/A367C for 5 min in either choline buffer or PBS. Incubation at these concentrations reduces transport activity maximally or half-maximally. Cells were then washed twice in PBSCM before radiolabeled glutamate uptake was performed in PBSCM as described above. Data are plotted as the percent of the carrier activity without CuPh treatment. Percent activity = 100 × uptake after/uptake before. CuPh Treatment in the Presence of Substrate—COS-7 cells expressing mutant or Cys-less-EAAT1 transporters were washed once with PBS and then incubated for 5 min in PBS or 10 mm l-glutamate with or without the addition of 300 μm CuPh. Cells were then washed twice with PBSCM, and 10 μm l-[3H]glutamate uptake was measured as described above. MTSET Modification after CuPh Treatment—Cells expressing mutant cysteine transporters were washed once with PBS, and then CuPh was applied at a concentration that results in maximal inhibition of transport. To remove the potential contribution of uncross-linked transporters, cells were then washed twice with PBS and incubated for 5 min with 1 mm MTSET, an impermeant sulfhydryl-modifying reagent established to completely inhibit A367C, A395C, and A440C (24Seal R.P.

Cells were again washed twice, and 10 μm l-[3H]glutamate uptake was measured as described above. dl-TBOA Inhibition of l-Glutamate Uptake—COS-7 cells were transfected with the cysteine substitution mutants and washed once with PBSCM and then preincubated with dl-TBOA, a nontransported substrate analog, at concentrations ranging from 64 nm to 5 mm in PBSCM for 5 min, and uptake of 10 μm l-glutamate (100 nml-[3H]glutamate) was measured, as described above. Cells were then washed and processed as described above for scintillation counting. Results are expressed as the inhibition of l-glutamate uptake as a function of the concentration of dl-TBOA. IC50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego). The IC50 values are the mean ± S.E. of 3–4 independent experiments done in triplicate. CuPh Treatment in the Presence of TBOA—COS-7 cells expressing cysteine substitution mutants or Cys-less-EAAT1 transporters were washed once with PBS or choline containing buffer and then incubated for 5 min in PBS or choline with and without 1 mm TBOA and in the presence or absence of CuPh (300 μm A395C/A440C or 700 μm A395C/A367C). Cells were then washed twice with PBSCM prior to 10 μm glutamate uptake as described above. Three-dimensional Modeling—The software Swiss-PDBViewer was used to generate a folding model of EAAT1 based on a manual sequence alignment with the glutamate transporter homolog from Pyrococcus horikoshii (GltPh) (18Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). The model is depicted without refinement. Images were rendered using MacPymol (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA). Effects of Cysteine Cross-linking on Transport—We constructed 22 double cysteine transporters for this cross-linking study using as the template a previously characterized and fully functional version of EAAT1 that lacks endogenous cysteines (Cys-less-EAAT1) (27Seal R.P. Amara S.G. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1487-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We focused on residues that we knew were similar in accessibility and in phenotype following modification (24Seal R.P. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G. Neuron. 2000; 25: 695-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and that could be protected from modification by substrates and inhibitors (data not shown). To determine whether the cysteine pair introduced into each transporter is capable of forming a disulfide bond, we expressed each transporter in COS-7 cells and then measured the accumulation of radiolabeled l-glutamate before and after exposure to the cross-linking reagent CuPh. From this assay, we identified two double cysteine transporters, A395C/A367C and A395C/A440C (Fig. 1), that exhibit a dramatic decrease in transport activity following exposure to CuPh. The other transporter mutants showed either impaired transport activity in the absence of 300 μm CuPh (A395C/T362C, A395C/S363C, A395C/S366C, A395C/I371C, A395C/A414C, A395C/T428C, A395C/I429C, A395C/A441C, A395C/G442C, A395C/T450C, A395C/M451C, and A395C/S457C) or no change in transport activity after exposure to CuPh (A367C/A435C, A367C/I438C, A367C/G439C, A367C/A440C, A367C/T462C, and A395C/G439C; see Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Transport activity of cysteine substitution mutants before and after CuPh treatment. Double and single cysteine transporters expressed in COS-7 cells were assayed for their ability to transport 10 μm l-glutamate before and after incubation with 300 μm CuPh. Results are expressed as a percent of the activity measured for Cys-less-EAAT1 and are the average ± S.E. of 4–8 experiments done in triplicate. The * denotes a significant difference from the untreated control, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To better characterize the effect of CuPh on the A395C/A367C and A395C/A440C transporters, we measured glutamate transport activity as a function of CuPh concentration. For both transporters, we observed that increasing concentrations of the cross-linking agent (1–1500 μm) lead to a greater reduction in glutamate transport (data not shown). Because the transport activity of our control Cys-less-EAAT1 transporter declines slightly at 1 mm CuPh, in subsequent experiments, we used CuPh concentrations that maximize cross-linking but do not affect the Cys-less-EAAT1 transporter (300 μm for the A395C/A440C transporter and 700 μm for the A395C/A367C transporter). However, even at the highest concentrations of CuPh, we still observed some residual transport activity in the A395C/A367C and A395C/A440C transporters (data not shown). To determine whether this residual activity results from incomplete cross-linking, we modified uncross-linked sulfhydryl groups with MTSET, a compound shown to abolish transport in the A395C, A367C, and A440C transporters (24Seal R.P. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G. Neuron. 2000; 25: 695-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 27Seal R.P. Amara S.G. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1487-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Indeed, application of MTSET after CuPh treatment abolishes the residual activity in both double cysteine transporters (Fig. 3, A and B) suggesting incomplete cross-linking of these residues. Our observations from cross-linking thus far suggest that Ala-395 in TM7 is indeed in close proximity to Ala-367 in HP1 and to Ala-440 in HP2, the two re-entrant loops postulated to gate the translocation pore. Disulfide Bond Formation Is Reversible and Intra-molecular— To determine whether the effect of CuPh treatment on the two double cysteine transporters is reversible, we incubated the carriers first with CuPh and then with the reducing agent, DTT, for 5 min. As expected, incubation with 20 mm DTT restored transport activity in both double cysteine transporters (Fig. 3, A and B). In rare instances CuPh can lead to the formation of covalent links between cysteine and other residues and thus the reversibility in the presence of DTT confirms the formation of a disulfide bond. To determine whether the cross-linking in these carriers occurs intra-molecularly or inter-molecularly, we examined the effect of CuPh on the transport activity of the single cysteine mutants, A367C, A395C, and A440C expressed either individually or in pairs (A395C with A367C and A395C with A440C) (Fig. 3, A and B). As shown in Table 1, the uptake activity of the individual transporters is similar to that observed for Cys-less-EAAT1 (A395C Km = 41 ± 10 μm, A440C Km = 30 ± 7 μm, and A367C Km = 42 ± 6 μm) and when expressed either alone or with the two single mutants together is unaffected by incubation with CuPh (Table 1). Thus, disulfide bonds formed in the double cysteine transporters are reversible and occur within single subunits rather than between subunits. These findings reinforce the idea that any functional effects of cross-linking observed in the A395C/A367C and A395C/A440C transporters likely arise from constraints within the translocation core of a single monomer.TABLE 1Cross-linking alters transport kineticsVmaxKm300 μm CuPhVmaxKmCys-less-EAAT110033 ± 697 ± 332 ± 4A395C/A440C19 ± 124 ± 320 ± 3167 ± 25**A395C65 ± 841 ± 1068 ± 438 ± 5A440C30 ± 530 ± 729 ± 222 ± 3VmaxKm700 μm CuPhVmaxKmCys-less-EAAT110041 ± 5102 ± 263 ± 12A395C/A367C37 ± 355 ± 914 ± 1**37 ± 7A395C67 ± 841 ± 1072 ± 164 ± 14A367C60 ± 442 ± 656 ± 350 ± 7 Open table in a new tab Cross-linking Alters Transport Kinetics—To examine the effect of intra-molecular cross-linking on the transport kinetics of these carriers, we measured the apparent transport affinity (Km) and maximum transport rate (Vmax) of glutamate before and after exposure to CuPh. In the absence of CuPh, the double cysteine transporters exhibit Km values that are comparable with Cys-less-EAAT1 (Cys-less-EAAT1, Km = 33 ± 6 μm; A395C/A440C, Km = 24 ± 3 μm; and A395C/A367C, Km = 55 ± 9 μm) (Table 1). After cross-linking, however, A395C/A367C exhibits the same apparent transport affinity (Km = 37 ± 7 μm) but a reduced Vmax (Table 1 and Fig. 4B). In contrast, A395C/A440C has a significantly lower apparent transport affinity (Km = 167 ± 25 μm) but the same Vmax (Table 1 and Fig. 4A). These data suggest that disulfide bond formation between A395C in TM7 and A367C in HP1 (the proposed intracellular gate) abolishes transport function, whereas a disulfide bond formed between the A395C and A440C in HP2 (the proposed extracellular gate) can surprisingly still permit maximal transport activity, albeit with a lower apparent transport affinity.

https://openalex.org/W2124711449,"Angiogenesis plays an essential role in tumor growth. This study investigated expression of the noncollagenous domain of alpha3(IV) collagen (alpha3(IV)NC1) transduced into tumors and its inhibition of tumor growth. We hypothesized that if a human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter-driven RGD motif containing alpha3(IV)NC1 (hTERT/RGD-alpha3(IV)NC1) were expressed in telomerase-expressing tumor cells, it would inhibit tumor growth by its anti-angiogenic property. Adenoviral transduction of hTERT/RGD-alpha3(IV)NC1 expressed RGD-alpha3(IV)NC1 in hTERT-positive tumor cell lines. However, hTERT/RGD-alpha3(IV)NC1 did not express RGD-alpha3(IV)NC1 in hTERT-negative cells such as keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The secreted RGD-alpha3(IV)NC1 in the conditioned medium from tumor cells inhibited cell proliferation as well as tube formation in cultured endothelial cells, but had no effect on other types of cells. In an in vivo model, adenoviral hTERT/RGD-alpha3(IV)NC1 gene therapy showed limited expression of RGD-alpha3(IV)NC1 in tumors and resulted in a significant decrease of vessel density in tumors. The growth of subcutaneous (s.c.) tumors in nude mice was significantly suppressed by treatment with hTERT/RGD-alpha3(IV)NC1. In addition, long-term inhibition of tumor growth was achieved by intermittent administration of hTERT/RGD-alpha3(IV)NC1. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that tumor-specific anti-angiogenic gene therapy utilizing RGD-alpha3(IV)NC1 under the hTERT promoter inhibited angiogenesis in tumors, resulting in an antitumor effect."
https://openalex.org/W2133232503,"YidC is a member of the OxaI family of membrane proteins that has been implicated in the membrane insertion of inner membrane proteins in Escherichia coli. We have recently demonstrated that proteoliposomes containing only YidC support both the stable membrane insertion and the oligomerization of the c subunit of the F1F0 ATP synthase (F0c). Here we have shown that two mutants of F0c unable to form a functional F1F0 ATPase interact with YidC, require YidC for membrane insertion, but fail to oligomerize. These data show that oligomerization is not essential for the stable YidC-dependent membrane insertion of F0c consistent with a function of YidC as a membrane protein insertase.

These data show that oligomerization is not essential for the stable YidC-dependent membrane insertion of F0c consistent with a function of YidC as a membrane protein insertase. Membrane protein targeting and insertion in Escherichia coli generally occurs via the highly conserved SRP/SecYEG pathway (1Herskovits A.A. Bochkareva E.S. Bibi E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 2de Gier J.W. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, another membrane protein, YidC, that associates with SecYEG has been implicated in membrane protein insertion (3Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L.

YidC is a member of the Alb3/OxaI/YidC family of membrane proteins that function in promoting membrane insertion in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and bacteria (4Luirink J. Samuelsson T. de Gier J.W.

YidC was shown to cross-link to the transmembrane regions of nascent membrane proteins (3Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. Oudega B.

Indeed, recent evidence shows that YidC is essential for the Sec translocase-mediated membrane insertion of subunit a of the cytochrome bo3 oxidase subunit (8du Plessis D.J. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M.

YidC has also been implicated in the folding of LacY but appears not to be essential for its membrane insertion (11Nagamori S. Smirnova I.N. Kaback H.R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Importantly, YidC also functions independently of the Sec translocase in membrane protein insertion. This was first demonstrated for small phage proteins such as M13 procoat (12Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) and Pf3 coat (13Chen M. Samuelson J.C. Jiang F. Muller M. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol.

FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The c subunit of the F1F0 ATP synthase (F0c) was shown to be an authentic substrate for this YidC-only pathway (15van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 16Yi L. Celebi N. Chen M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39260-39267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). F0c is a small inner membrane protein with two transmembrane segments that assembles into a decameric ring structure in E. coli (17Fillingame R.H. Angevine C.M. Dmitriev O.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The c-ring is associated with two b subunits and one a subunit (F0b and F0a, respectively) and forms the membrane-embedded F0 sector. The catalytic F1 domain is peripherally bound to the F0 sector at the cytosolic side of the membrane. The F1F0 ATP synthase converts the energy stored in a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient into ATP and plays a central role in the energy metabolism of the cell. ATP synthesis or hydrolysis occurs on three catalytic sites in the F1 sector, whereas H+ transport occurs through the F0 subcomplex at the interface between F0a and the F0c ring (18Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 154-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 19Senior A.E. Nadanaciva S. Weber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 188-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 20Weber J. Senior A.E. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Using an in vitro system it was demonstrated that YidC is required and sufficient for the stable membrane insertion of F0c in its correct topology (15van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Membrane-inserted F0c was found to assemble into a large oligomeric complex with a size reminiscent of that of the F0c ring observed in vivo. Interestingly, all known proteins that strictly require YidC for membrane insertion, the major coat proteins of the bacteriophages Pf3 and M13 (21Russel M. Linderoth N.A. Sali A. Gene. 1997; 192: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), F0c of the F1F0 ATP synthase, and subunit a of the cytochrome bo3 oxidase subunit, assemble into large oligomeric structures, which may point to a role of YidC in the assembly of macromolecular protein complexes. Furthermore, this raises the question of whether insertion and oligomerization are concerted processes and whether these both require the function of YidC. YidC may act solely as a membrane protein insertase mediating the membrane integration of F0c monomers. Alternatively, YidC may function as a membrane chaperone that stabilizes the “spontaneously” membrane-inserted monomeric form of F0c in its correct conformation to facilitate its oligomerization. Another possibility is that YidC catalyzes both the insertion and assembly reactions. To distinguish between the putative insertase and chaperone functions of YidC we have analyzed the YidC dependence of the membrane insertion of two F0c mutants, i.e. G23D and L31F, that do not support the formation of an active F1F0 ATP synthase (22Downie J.A. Cox G.B. Langman L. Ash G. Becker M. Gibson F. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 200-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Jans D.A. Fimmel A.L. Langman L. James L.B. Downie J.A. Senior A.E. Ash G.R. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These mutants have been suggested to be defective in assembly of the F0 sector, but the exact nature of the assembly defect has not been elucidated (24Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 791-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that the two F0c mutants still insert in vitro into the membrane in a YidC-dependent manner but that they are unable to assemble into an oligomer. This shows that the oligomerization into the c-ring per se is not essential for the stable YidC-dependent membrane insertion of F0c consistent with a function of YidC as a membrane protein insertase. Strains and Plasmids—The uncE114 mutant strain MM944Iq (25Miller M.J. Fraga D. Paule C.R. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 305-311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used in the in vivo complementation experiments and ATPase activity and ΔpH measurements. pET20AtpE was used for the in vitro transcription of wild-type F0c (15van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). pET20AtpE-G23D and pET20AtpE-L31F were constructed by replacing the GGT codon at position 23 with GAT or the CTC codon at position 31 with TTC in the atpE gene, respectively. For in vivo expression, the NdeI/EcoRI sites surrounding atpE were replaced by NcoI/BamHI sites, and the resulting fragment was cloned into the plasmid pTrc99a, yielding pTrc99AtpE and its derivatives pTrc99AtpE-G23D and pTrc99AtpE-L31F. In Vivo Complementation—The pTrc99a-based plasmids were used to transform strain MM944Iq. Cells were streaked on M63 minimal medium plates containing 0.6% succinate or 0.2% glucose with the appropriate supplements and 25 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μg/ml ampicillin (25Miller M.J. Fraga D. Paule C.R. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 305-311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown for 20 h at 37 °C. ATPase and ΔpH Measurements—Strain MM944Iq transformed with the appropriate plasmids was grown on M63 medium supplemented with 0.6% glucose, the appropriate supplements, 25 μg/ml kanamycin, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 400 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for induction until an OD660 of 1.0. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and inner membrane vesicles (IMVs) 5The abbreviations used are: IMV, inner membrane vesicle; ACMA, 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine; DDM, dodecyl maltoside. were isolated by French pressure treatment (26de Vrije T. Tommassen J. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 900: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of isolated IMVs at 37 °C was measured by the malachite green assay as described (27Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). To inhibit the activity of coupled F1F0 complexes 250 μm dicyclohexylcarbodiimide was used. The ΔpH in IMVs was measured by means of the fluorescent dye 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (ACMA). Reaction mixtures contained 1.25 μg/ml IMVs and 1 μm ACMA in 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reactions were started by the addition of 1 mm ATP or 1.25 mm NADH, and the ACMA fluorescence was monitored in a PerkinElmer LS50B luminescence spectrophotometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 409 and 474 nm, respectively. In Vitro Insertion Reaction Assays—The RiboMax transcription kit (Promega) was used for the synthesis of mRNA in a coupled transcription/translation system. Reactions were carried out for 20 min at 37 °C in the presence of proteoliposomes as described previously (28van der Laan M. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1659-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A small sample of the reaction mixture was used as a synthesis control, and the remainder was treated with 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K for 30 min on ice in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100. Samples were trichloroacetic acid precipitated and analyzed by 18% SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. Blue Native PAGE Analysis—F0c was synthesized radioactively in the presence of proteoliposomes containing YidC or without protein present. After re-isolation of the F0c-loaded (proteo) liposomes, pellets were resuspended in 25 μl of solubilization buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% dodecyl maltoside) and incubated for 15 min on ice. Samples were then mixed with gel-loading buffer. Blue Native PAGE was performed on an 8–18% gradient gel as previously described (29Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). Association of in Vitro-synthesized F0c with YidC—F0c was synthesized radioactively in the presence of YidC proteoliposomes, empty liposomes, or no membranes present. After synthesis, 0.1% DDM-solubilized YidC proteoliposomes were added to the reactions without membranes present. All reactions were subsequently treated with 0.1% DDM, and after 15 min on ice nonsolubilized proteins were removed by centrifugation through a glycerol cushion consisting of 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.1% DDM, 20% glycerol. The supernatant was mixed with Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) equilibrated with buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1% DDM) containing 10 mm imidazole. The suspension was gently shaken for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with 10 volumes of buffer A containing 60 mm imidazole, and bound proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole, transferred to gel-loading buffer, and analyzed by 18% SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. Other Methods—YidC was purified and reconstituted into E. coli phospholipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL) as described (30van der Laan M. Houben E.N. Nouwen N. Luirink J. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). YidC polyclonal antiserum was raised in rabbit against purified hisYidC by Agrisera (Umeå, Sweden). F0c monoclonal antiserum was a generous gift from G. Deckers-Hebestreit (University of Osnabrück, Germany). F0c G23D and L31F Mutants Are Defective in the Formation of an Active F1F0 ATP Synthase—Previously, two F0c mutants (G23D and L31F) (22Downie J.A. Cox G.B. Langman L. Ash G. Becker M. Gibson F. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 200-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Jans D.A. Fimmel A.L. Langman L. James L.B. Downie J.A. Senior A.E. Ash G.R. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have been isolated that do not support the assembly of a functional F1F0 ATP synthase, possibly as a result of a defect in the formation of a functional F0 sector. As both mutants have not been analyzed biochemically, we first validated their phenotype in vivo. For this purpose, the atpE (G23D) and atpE (L31F) mutant genes were cloned behind the inducible trc promotor and the resulting plasmids were transformed into strain MM944Iq. This strain contains a chromosomal mutation in the atpE gene encoding subunit c (Q42E) that disturbs the binding of F1 to the F0 subcomplex (25Miller M.J. Fraga D. Paule C.R. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 305-311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strain MM944Iq is unable to grow on minimal medium with succinate as an energy and carbon source, whereas growth on glucose is undisturbed. Introduction of a plasmid containing wild-type atpE into MM944Iq fully restored growth on succinate minimal medium plates (Fig. 1A, right panel), whereas an empty plasmid or a plasmid containing atpE (G23D) had no effect. A plasmid containing atpE (L31F) also restored growth of strain MM944Iq on succinate minimal medium plates, but after overnight growth at 37 °C observed colonies were approximately half the size of the colonies with the wild-type atpE plasmid (Fig. 1A, left panel). Immunoblotting showed that the levels of F0c in IMVs derived from cells expressing wild-type F0c and F0c L31F are elevated as compared with background levels of the chromosomal atpE gene (Fig. 1B, insert), whereas with F0c G23D IMVs the level of F0c is only marginally increased. To obtain quantitative information on the activity of the F0c mutants, IMVs from strain MM944Iq were analyzed for their ATPase activity and ability to generate a proton motive force. In contrast to the wild-type, both F0c mutants supported only low levels of ATPase activity. When dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an inhibitor of proton translocation by F1F0 ATP synthase, was added, the ATPase activity of the wild-type was strongly reduced whereas the activity of the mutant complexes was unaffected (Fig. 1B). To examine the effect of the F0c mutants on the ability of the F1F0 ATP synthase to generate a proton motive force, IMVs were incubated with either ATP or NADH and the generation of a transmembrane proton gradient (ΔpH) was monitored with the fluorescent dye ACMA. The ionophore valinomycin that converts the transmembrane electrical potential (Δψ) into an additional ΔpH was added to ensure that the ΔpH is the only component of the proton motive force, while the ionophore nigericin was added to collapse the ΔpH. In contrast to wild-type F0c (Fig. 2A), the F0c G23D and F0c L31F mutants were defective in the ATP-dependent generation of a ΔpH (Fig. 2, B and C). The inhibitory effect of the ionophore nigericin is somewhat more pronounced with the F0c L31F mutant, suggesting the presence of a very small ΔpH (Fig. 2C). When the oxidizable substrate NADH was added as an energy source all IMVs were capable of generating a ΔpH, showing that the expression of the F0c mutants does not interfere with the integrity of the membrane (Fig. 2, D–G). These data demonstrate that the F0c mutants G23D and L31F are defective in the formation of an active F1F0 ATP synthase complex. F0c G23D and L31F Insert in a YidC-dependent Manner into the Membrane but Are Unable to Form Oligomeric Complexes— YidC is required for the efficient insertion of wild-type F0c into liposomes and IMVs (15van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and in intact cells (15van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N.

Chem. 2004; 279: 39260-39267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To test the membrane insertion requirement of the F0c mutants, the proteins were synthesized in a cell-free transcription/translation system and assayed for membrane insertion into liposomes and YidC proteoliposomes using a protease protection assay (15van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In the presence of YidC proteoliposomes, wild-type F0c was protease resistant as shown before (15van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A, lane 2). F0c G23D and F0c L31F were also found to be protease protected in the presence of YidC proteoliposomes (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and 6), although insertion was less efficient as compared with wild-type F0c. The formation of a second proteolytic fragment of F0c L31F was observed at ∼4 kDa (Fig. 3A, lane 8), which may point to an effect of the L31F mutation on the conformation of F0c resulting in an altered susceptibility to the added protease. Similar results were obtained when IMVs were used instead of YidC proteoliposomes (data not shown). No or very little proteaseprotected F0c could be detected in protein-free liposomes (Fig. 3B). These data demonstrate that the F0c G23D and L31F mutants insert into the membrane in a YidC-dependent manner. In vivo, the F0c subunits assemble into a ring-like structure that forms part of the rotor domain of F1F0 ATP synthase (31Vonck J. von Nidda T.K. Meier T. Matthey U. Mills D.J. Kuhlbrandt W. Dimroth P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar– 33Meier T. Polzer P. Diederichs K. Welte W. Dimroth P. Science. 2005; 308: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that in vitro, YidC membrane-inserted wild-type F0c assembles into an oligomer (15van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To determine whether the membrane-inserted F0c mutants are capable of oligomerization, YidC proteoliposomes containing membrane-inserted F0c were re-isolated, solubilized with the detergent dodecyl maltoside, and subjected to Blue Native PAGE (Fig. 3C). Radioactively labeled wild-type F0c was detected as a high molecular mass complex of ∼80 kDa (Fig. 3C, lane 1) (15van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The F0c G23D and L31F mutants both failed to form such a complex and are only visible as a broad and a weak band, most likely the monomeric species (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 3). These data demonstrate that, at least in vitro, the YidC membrane-inserted F0c G23D and L31F mutants are defective in the formation of a stable oligomer. F0c Associates with YidC in Vitro—Because the wild-type F0c and assembly mutants require YidC for membrane insertion, the physical interaction between YidC and F0c during membrane integration was addressed. Co-affinity purification was used to assay for the association of membrane-integrated YidC with in vitro synthesized and inserted radiolabeled F0c. After an insertion reaction, membranes were solubilized with DDM. Unsolubilized membrane proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated with Ni2+-NTA beads to purify His-tagged YidC. Co-purification of F0c was subsequently analyzed by autoradiography. Immunoblotting showed that the recovery of YidC in all samples was identical (Fig. 4B). Only a low level of background binding of F0c to Ni2+-NTA beads is observed with protein-free liposomes (Fig. 4A, lanes 4–6), but in the presence of YidC-containing proteoliposomes significant levels of in vitro synthesized F0c co-purified (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–3). Remarkably, the F0c G23D mutant reproducibly co-purifies to an up to 2-fold higher extent than wild-type and F0c L31F. Strikingly, a much lower level of association was observed when solubilized YidC proteoliposomes were added after the in vitro synthesis reaction had been completed (Fig. 4A, lanes 7–9). These data demonstrate that YidC directly interacts with F0c within the membrane and that the G23D mutation in F0c stabilizes this interaction. The functional assembly of energy-transducing membrane protein complexes such as the cytochrome bo3 oxidase and the F1F0 ATP synthase in E. coli is strongly affected by the cellular depletion of YidC (34van der Laan M. Urbanus M.L. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Nouwen N. Oudega B. Harms N. Driessen A.J.M. Luirink J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5801-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Recent in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate that key subunits of these energy transducing complexes strictly require YidC for membrane insertion (8du Plessis D.J. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. J.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Reconstitution studies demonstrate that YidC alone mediates the stable membrane insertion of subunit c (F0c) of the F0 sector of the F1F0 ATP synthase. Upon membrane insertion, a large oligomeric complex is formed with a molecular mass reminiscent of that of the F0c ring (15van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Here we have characterized two mutants of F0c that are unable to form a functional F1F0 ATP synthase. Our data suggest that the assembly defect of the mutants is due to a deficiency in the F0c ring formation, whereas the membrane insertion of these mutant proteins still strictly depends on YidC. This study therefore separates the proposed chaperone and insertase functions of YidC in the biogenesis of the F0 sector. In vivo, the defect of the two F0c mutants may be even further strengthened by a rapid degradation of the unassembled F0c subunits by FtsH (37Akiyama Y. Kihara A. Ito K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 26-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that YidC is also actively involved in the oligomerization of F0c, this process appears not to be mechanistically linked to the initial insertion. YidC may facilitate the hydrophobic partitioning of F0c into the membrane by providing an amphiphilic surface (38van der Laan M. Nouwen N.P. Driessen A.J.M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and subsequent oligomerization of correctly inserted F0c units upon their release from YidC may be spontaneous events as suggested previously (39Arechaga I. Butler P.J. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). By co-affinity purification we have demonstrated that YidC directly interacts with its substrate F0c. This interaction was found to be more pronounced with one of the assembly mutants, F0c G23D, which suggests a slower release of F0c G23D by YidC. Because this effect is not as dramatic as the oligomerization defect, assembly is most likely interrupted because of the inability of the mutant c subunits to interact (see below). Chen et al. (13Chen M. Samuelson J.C. Jiang F. Muller M. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7670-7675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have previously shown by photo-cross-linking that YidC interacts with an arrested nascent chain of the Sec-independent phage protein, Pf3 coat. However, photo-cross-linking is not a suitable approach to study the interaction between YidC and F0c, because the formation of a helical hairpin, which has been suggested to drive the membrane integration of F0c (38van der Laan M. Nouwen N.P. Driessen A.J.M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 40Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1981; 23: 411-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), can only occur when both termini of the polypeptide chain have been released from the ribosome. Our co-affinity-purified YidC-F0c complex most likely represents an insertion and assembly intermediate of the catalytic cycle. The in vivo and biochemical characterizations of the mutant F1F0 ATP synthase complexes demonstrate that the F0c G23D and L31F mutants are unable to support the formation of an active F0 sector. The crystal structure of the c-ring of an F-type Na+ ATP synthase of Ilyobacter tartaricus (33Meier T. Polzer P. Diederichs K. Welte W. Dimroth P. Science. 2005; 308: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) now provides clues as to why these mutants are disturbed in oligomerization. An aspartate residue introduced at position 23 (I. tartaricus Gly-27) protrudes laterally from one F0c subunit, resulting in both intra- and intermolecular steric hindrances (Fig. 5A), whereas the bulkier phenylalanine residue at position 31 (I. tartaricus Ala-35) causes a more extensive hindrance, but only within a single F0c molecule (Fig. 5B). This difference in interactions might explain why the F0c L31F mutant, in contrast to the F0c G23D mutant, shows some ability to transport protons and, when overexpressed, rescues the growth defect on succinate. The intramolecular hindrances of the L31F mutant seem to destabilize the oligomer so that it does not survive native electrophoresis. However, oligomer formation is not completely abolished, because in vivo, partial activity of the F1F0 ATPase is retained. Moreover, the other F0 subunits and the F1 subcomplex may have a further stabilizing effect on the defective c-ring in vivo. The intermolecular hindrance of F0c G23D disturbs the interactions between different subunits and consequently severely affects the assembly of the c-ring. It should be stressed that the level of F0c in IMVs derived from cells expressing F0c G23D is only marginally increased, which may point to degradation of incorrectly folded or conformationally unstable F0c (37Akiyama Y. Kihara A. Ito K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 26-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The altered interaction between subunits, the partial membrane insertion defect and possibly a reduced transmembrane stability, and finally the slower release from YidC into the lipid bilayer will all contribute to a strongly reduced ability to form an active F1F0 ATPase complex, thus explaining the growth defect of F0c G23D containing F1F0 ATPase on succinate. The biogenesis of the active F1F0 ATPase is likely a coordinated process that requires the membrane insertion of the separate F0 subunits, the stabilization of these subunits prior to their assembly into the F0 subcomplex with the correct stoichiometry of a, b and c subunits, and finally the coupling of F0 to the F1 sector. It is not clear if the F1-sector and the F0-sector are fully assembled before coupling occurs, but in vitro studies demonstrate that mixing of the separately purified complexes results in the restoration of coupled ATPase activity (41Steffens K. Schneider E. Herkenhoff B. Schmid R. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 138: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that F0a is not present in the membrane unless F0c and F0b are co-expressed (42Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2815-2817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In vitro, F0a and F0b can be isolated as a subcomplex that when co-reconstituted with F0c yields a functional F0 sector (43Stalz W.D. Greie J.C. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27068-27071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). F0a is unstable when uncomplexed, and it is degraded by the FtsH protease (37Akiyama Y. Kihara A. Ito K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 26-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). On the other hand, stable F1F0 complexes occur without F0a present (44Vik S.B. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8340-8346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the activity of the subunit a-deprived complexes of the thermophilic Bacillus PS3 can be restored by the simple addition of purified F0a (45Ono S. Sone N. Yoshida M. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33409-33412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fluorescence studies have shown that F0b and a fully assembled c-ring suffice for the binding of the F1 subcomplex (46Krebstakies T. Zimmermann B. Graber P. Altendorf K. Borsch M. Greie J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33338-33345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These data imply that a correct and timed assembly of the c-ring is crucial for the formation of a functional ATP synthase and that F0a might be the last component that in vivo is added to a complex of F0b and the c-ring. The Alb3/OxaI/YidC family of proteins are not only structurally but also functionally related (47Preuss M. Ott M. Funes S. Luirink J. Herrmann J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13004-13011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 48Yi L. Dalbey R.E. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In mitochondria, Oxa1p is involved in the membrane insertion of a subset of proteins synthesized in the mitochondrial matrix and interacts with translating ribosomes (49Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Oxa1p is needed for the assembly of large energy-transducing complexes such as the F1F0 ATP synthase and the cytochrome c oxidase (50Lemaire C. Hamel P. Velours J. Dujardin G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23471-23475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 51Altamura N. Capitanio N. Bonnefoy N. Papa S. Dujardin G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The thylakoidal Alb3 protein is required for the membrane insertion and assembly of light harvesting proteins (52Moore M. Harrison M.S. Peterson E.C. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1529-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The results presented in this study do not exclude the possibility that YidC also actively participates in the assembly of large membrane complexes. In the case of F0c, YidC might accumulate single or several membrane-inserted subunits prior to the formation of the ring structure. Our observation that stable YidC-F0c subcomplexes can be isolated is consistent with this hypothesis. Future studies should address the mechanism by which the various subunits assemble into a functional F0-sector and how protein substrates are released by YidC. We thank Robert H. Fillingame, Department of Physiological Chemistry, University of Wisconsin Medical School, for donating strain MM944Iq and Gabriele Deckers-Hebestreit, University of Osnabrück, Germany, for the F0c monoclonal antiserum."
https://openalex.org/W1973677548,"Dmp1 is a Myb-like transcription factor that transmits oncogenic Ras-Raf signaling to the Arf-p53 pathway and induces cell cycle arrest. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to identify the pattern of Dmp1 expression in normal murine tissues compared with the proliferation marker, Ki67. In thymus, the nuclei of mature T lymphocytes in the medulla were strongly positive for Dmp1, whereas Ki67 was detected only in the cortex. In intestine, Dmp1 was detected in the nuclei of superficial layers of the villi, whereas Ki67-positive cells were confined to the lower one-third of the crypt. Double staining for Dmp1 and Ki67 revealed that these two proteins were expressed in mutually exclusive fashion in nearly all the tissues examined. Subsets of E2Fs were specifically bound to the Dmp1 promoter upon mitogenic signaling and E2Fs 1-4 inhibited the Dmp1 promoter in a reporter assay. The Dmp1 promoter was repressed when the cells entered the S to G2/M phase of the cell cycle when both Dmp1 and Arf expressions were downregulated. The Dmp1 mRNA was not downregulated by serum in E2F-DB(+) cells, suggesting that the Dmp1 promoter repression is E2F-dependent. This explains why the Dmp1 and Ki67-positive cells are stained in mutually exclusive fashion in normal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1995608266,"CoAA is an RRM-containing transcriptional coactivator that stimulates transcriptional activation and regulates alternative splicing. We show that the CoAA gene is amplified at the chromosome 11q13 locus in a subset of primary human cancers including non-small cell lung carcinoma, squamous cell skin carcinoma and lymphoma. Analysis of 42 primary tumors suggests that CoAA amplifies independently from the CCND1 locus. Detailed mapping of three CoAA amplicons reveals that the amplified CoAA gene is consistently located at the 5' boundaries of the amplicons. The CoAA coding and basal promoter sequences are retained within the amplicons but upstream silencing sequences are lost. CoAA protein is overexpressed in tumors containing the amplified CoAA gene. RNA dot blot analysis of 100 cases of primary tumors suggests elevated CoAA mRNA expression. CoAA positively regulates its own basal promoter in transfection assays. Thus, gene amplification, loss of silencing sequence and positive feedback regulation may lead to drastic upregulation of CoAA protein. CoAA has transforming activities when tested in soft agar assays, and CoAA is homologous to oncoproteins EWS and TLS, which regulate alternative splicing. These data imply that CoAA may share a similar oncogenic mechanism with oncogene EWS and that CoAA deregulation may alter the alternative splicing of target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2102228096,"Scorpion beta and alpha-toxins modify the activation and inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels. Although the two types of toxin bind at two distinct receptor sites on the same sodium channel, they exhibit synergic effects when coinjected into insects. To clarify the basis of this synergism we examined the mutual effects of alpha and beta toxin representatives in radio-ligand binding assays. We found positive allosteric interactions between receptor site-4 of the excitatory Bj-xtrIT and the depressant LqhIT2 beta toxins and receptor site-3 of the alpha toxin LqhalphaIT, on locust neuronal membranes. Unexpectedly, a nontoxic mutant Bj-xtrIT-E15R, which binds with high affinity to receptor site-4, was able to enhance LqhalphaIT binding and toxicity similarly to the unmodified Bj-xtrIT. This result indicates that mere binding of a nontoxic ligand to receptor site-4 (""silent binding"") induces a conformational change that does not alter channel gating, but influences toxin binding at receptor site-3 leading to enhanced toxicity. This finding suggests a new functional role for weakly toxic polypeptides in that they enhance the effect of other active neurotoxins in the arthropod venom. Such silent binding may have also valuable implications in attempts to improve drug efficacy by combining potent drugs with nonactive allosteric enhancers."
https://openalex.org/W2122152182,"Postoperative ileus, a major cause of morbidity after abdominal surgery, is characterized by intestinal dysmotility and inflammation. The aim was to investigate the involvement of sphingolipids in postoperative intestinal inflammation using a standardized rat model of intestinal surgical manipulation. Sphingolipid analysis (ESI-MS) of intestinal muscularis after manipulation revealed a time-dependent increase of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and of ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P). We therefore established a culture system of primary rat intestinal smooth muscle cells and examined the potential role of these sphingolipids in intestinal inflammation. Incubation of cells with either of the two sphingolipid-phosphates resulted in an elevated production of PGE(2). Further analysis revealed that S1P enhances cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression whereas C1P increases release of arachidonic acid, indicating an enhanced phospholipase A(2) activity. S1P-induced COX-2 expression was pertussis toxin sensitive, suggesting the involvement of Gi/o protein-coupled S1P receptors. Further downstream mediators of S1P induced COX-2 expression appear to be extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Collectively, our results demonstrate that intestinal smooth muscle cells represent a major target for both C1P and S1P activity. Thus, the sustained elevated concentration of the two bioactive sphingolipids in this tissue could at least in part explain postoperative intestinal dysmotility."
https://openalex.org/W2002644881,"The 5'-HS4 chicken beta-globin insulator functions as a positional enhancer blocker on chromatinized episomes in human cells, blocking the HS2 enhancer of the human beta-globin locus control region from activating a downstream epsilon-globin gene. 5'-HS4 interrupted formation of a domain of histone H3 and H4 acetylation encompassing the 6-kb minilocus and inhibited transfer of RNA polymerase from the enhancer to the gene promoter. We found that the enhancer blocking phenotype was amplified when the insulated locus contained a weakened HS2 enhancer in which clustered point mutations eliminated interaction of the transcription factor GATA-1. The GATA-1 mutation compromised recruitment of histone acetyltransferases and RNA polymerase II to HS2. Enhancer blocking correlated with a significant depletion of nucleosomes in the core region of the insulator as revealed by micrococcal nuclease and DNase I digestion studies. Nucleosome depletion at 5'-HS4 was dependent on interaction of the insulator protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and was required for enhancer blocking. These findings provide evidence that a domain of active chromatin is formed by spreading from an enhancer to a target gene and can be blocked by a nucleosome-free gap in an insulator."
https://openalex.org/W2002844583,"Growth factor-mediated signal transduction cascades can be regulated spatio-temporally by signaling modulators, such as Sprouty proteins. The four mammalian Sprouty family members are palmitoylated phosphoproteins that can attenuate or potentiate numerous growth factor-induced signaling pathways. Previously, we have shown that Sprouty-1 and Sprouty-2 associate with Caveolin-1, the major structural protein of caveolae. Like Sprouty, Caveolin-1 inhibits growth factor-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Here, we demonstrate that all four mammalian Sprouty family members physically interact with Caveolin-1. The C terminus of Caveolin-1 is the major Sprouty-binding site, whereas Sprouty binds Caveolin-1 via its conserved C-terminal domain. A single point mutation in this domain results in loss of Caveolin-1 interaction. Moreover, we demonstrate that the various Sprouty isoforms differ dramatically in their cooperation with Caveolin-1-mediated inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and that such cooperation is also highly dependent on the type of growth factor investigated and on cell density. Together, the data suggest that the Sprouty/Caveolin-1 interaction modulates signaling in a growth factor- and Sprouty isoform-specific manner."

https://openalex.org/W1588432421,"Transgenic mice overexpressing Notch4 intracellular domain (Int3) under the control of the whey acidic protein (WAP) or mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat promoters, develop mammary tumors. Microarray analysis of these tumors revealed high levels of c-Kit expression. Gleevec is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets c-Kit, platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) and c-Abl. This led us to speculate that tyrosine kinase receptor activity might be a driving force in the development of Int3 mammary tumors. WAP-Int3 tumor-bearing mice were treated with continuous release of Gleevec using subcutaneously implanted Alzet pumps. Phoshorylation of c-Kit, PDGFRs and c-Abl is inhibited in Int3 transgenic mammary tumors by Gleevec. Inhibition of these enzymes is associated with a decrease in cell proliferation and angiogenesis, and an induction of apoptosis. To examine the signaling mechanisms underlying Notch4/Int3 tumorigenesis, we employed small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knock down c-Kit, PDGFRs and c-Abl alone or in combination and observed the effects on soft agar growth of HC11 cells overexpressing Int3. Only siRNA constructs for c-Kit and/or PDGFR-α were able to inhibit HC11-Int3 colony formation in soft agar. Our data demonstrate an inhibitory effect of Gleevec on Int3-induced transformation of HC11 cells and mammary tumors and indicate an oncogenic role for c-Kit and PDGFR-α tyrosine kinases in the context of Int3 signaling."

Here we argue that stochastic fluctuation in the release machinery can give rise to apparent release-independent depression as a result of sampling bias. The relationship between this apparent depression and the interstimulus interval provides a window on the kinetics of state transitions of the release apparatus."
