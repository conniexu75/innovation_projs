https://openalex.org/W4280532787,"Recent understanding of how the systemic environment shapes the brain throughout life has led to numerous intervention strategies to slow brain ageing1-3. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) makes up the immediate environment of brain cells, providing them with nourishing compounds4,5. We discovered that infusing young CSF directly into aged brains improves memory function. Unbiased transcriptome analysis of the hippocampus identified oligodendrocytes to be most responsive to this rejuvenated CSF environment. We further showed that young CSF boosts oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) proliferation and differentiation in the aged hippocampus and in primary OPC cultures. Using SLAMseq to metabolically label nascent mRNA, we identified serum response factor (SRF), a transcription factor that drives actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, as a mediator of OPC proliferation following exposure to young CSF. With age, SRF expression decreases in hippocampal OPCs, and the pathway is induced by acute injection with young CSF. We screened for potential SRF activators in CSF and found that fibroblast growth factor 17 (Fgf17) infusion is sufficient to induce OPC proliferation and long-term memory consolidation in aged mice while Fgf17 blockade impairs cognition in young mice. These findings demonstrate the rejuvenating power of young CSF and identify Fgf17 as a key target to restore oligodendrocyte function in the ageing brain."
https://openalex.org/W4280576974,"The scaling of silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors has followed Moore's law for decades, but the physical thinning of silicon at sub-ten-nanometre technology nodes introduces issues such as leakage currents1. Two-dimensional (2D) layered semiconductors, with an atomic thickness that allows superior gate-field penetration, are of interest as channel materials for future transistors2,3. However, the integration of high-dielectric-constant (κ) materials with 2D materials, while scaling their capacitance equivalent thickness (CET), has proved challenging. Here we explore transferrable ultrahigh-κ single-crystalline perovskite strontium-titanium-oxide membranes as a gate dielectric for 2D field-effect transistors. Our perovskite membranes exhibit a desirable sub-one-nanometre CET with a low leakage current (less than 10-2 amperes per square centimetre at 2.5 megavolts per centimetre). We find that the van der Waals gap between strontium-titanium-oxide dielectrics and 2D semiconductors mitigates the unfavourable fringing-induced barrier-lowering effect resulting from the use of ultrahigh-κ dielectrics4. Typical short-channel transistors made of scalable molybdenum-disulfide films by chemical vapour deposition and strontium-titanium-oxide dielectrics exhibit steep subthreshold swings down to about 70 millivolts per decade and on/off current ratios up to 107, which matches the low-power specifications suggested by the latest International Roadmap for Devices and Systems5."
https://openalex.org/W4280592279,"The RNA world concept1 is one of the most fundamental pillars of the origin of life theory2-4. It predicts that life evolved from increasingly complex self-replicating RNA molecules1,2,4. The question of how this RNA world then advanced to the next stage, in which proteins became the catalysts of life and RNA reduced its function predominantly to information storage, is one of the most mysterious chicken-and-egg conundrums in evolution3-5. Here we show that non-canonical RNA bases, which are found today in transfer and ribosomal RNAs6,7, and which are considered to be relics of the RNA world8-12, are able to establish peptide synthesis directly on RNA. The discovered chemistry creates complex peptide-decorated RNA chimeric molecules, which suggests the early existence of an RNA-peptide world13 from which ribosomal peptide synthesis14 may have emerged15,16. The ability to grow peptides on RNA with the help of non-canonical vestige nucleosides offers the possibility of an early co-evolution of covalently connected RNAs and peptides13,17,18, which then could have dissociated at a higher level of sophistication to create the dualistic nucleic acid-protein world that is the hallmark of all life on Earth."
https://openalex.org/W4280500694,"Gasdermins (GSDMs) are a family of pore-forming effectors that permeabilize the cell membrane during the cell death program pyroptosis1. GSDMs are activated by proteolytic removal of autoinhibitory carboxy-terminal domains, typically by caspase regulators1-9. However, no activator is known for one member of this family, GSDMA. Here we show that the major human pathogen group A Streptococcus (GAS) secretes a protease virulence factor, SpeB, that induces GSDMA-dependent pyroptosis. SpeB cleavage of GSDMA releases an active amino-terminal fragment that can insert into membranes to form lytic pores. GSDMA is primarily expressed in the skin10, and keratinocytes infected with SpeB-expressing GAS die of GSDMA-dependent pyroptosis. Mice have three homologues of human GSDMA, and triple-knockout mice are more susceptible to invasive infection by a pandemic hypervirulent M1T1 clone of GAS. These results indicate that GSDMA is critical in the immune defence against invasive skin infections by GAS. Furthermore, they show that GSDMs can act independently of host regulators as direct sensors of exogenous proteases. As SpeB is essential for tissue invasion and survival within skin cells, these results suggest that GSDMA can act akin to a guard protein that directly detects concerning virulence activities of microorganisms that present a severe infectious threat."
https://openalex.org/W4280594254,"Non-coding genetic variants may cause disease by modulating gene expression. However, identifying these expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) is complicated by differences in gene regulation across fluid functional cell states within cell types. These states—for example, neurotransmitter-driven programs in astrocytes or perivascular fibroblast differentiation—are obscured in eQTL studies that aggregate cells1,2. Here we modelled eQTLs at single-cell resolution in one complex cell type: memory T cells. Using more than 500,000 unstimulated memory T cells from 259 Peruvian individuals, we show that around one-third of 6,511 cis-eQTLs had effects that were mediated by continuous multimodally defined cell states, such as cytotoxicity and regulatory capacity. In some loci, independent eQTL variants had opposing cell-state relationships. Autoimmune variants were enriched in cell-state-dependent eQTLs, including risk variants for rheumatoid arthritis near ORMDL3 and CTLA4; this indicates that cell-state context is crucial to understanding potential eQTL pathogenicity. Moreover, continuous cell states explained more variation in eQTLs than did conventional discrete categories, such as CD4+ versus CD8+, suggesting that modelling eQTLs and cell states at single-cell resolution can expand insight into gene regulation in functionally heterogeneous cell types. A single-cell Poisson model is used to analyse eQTLs in memory T cells across continuous, dynamic cell states, revealing that the cell context is critical to understanding variation in eQTLs and their association with disease."
https://openalex.org/W4280516302,"NPR1 is a master regulator of the defence transcriptome induced by the plant immune signal salicylic acid1–4. Despite the important role of NPR1 in plant immunity5–7, understanding of its regulatory mechanisms has been hindered by a lack of structural information. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy and crystal structures of Arabidopsis NPR1 and its complex with the transcription factor TGA3. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis reveals that NPR1 is a bird-shaped homodimer comprising a central Broad-complex, Tramtrack and Bric-à-brac (BTB) domain, a BTB and carboxyterminal Kelch helix bundle, four ankyrin repeats and a disordered salicylic-acid-binding domain. Crystal structure analysis reveals a unique zinc-finger motif in BTB for interacting with ankyrin repeats and mediating NPR1 oligomerization. We found that, after stimulation, salicylic-acid-induced folding and docking of the salicylic-acid-binding domain onto ankyrin repeats is required for the transcriptional cofactor activity of NPR1, providing a structural explanation for a direct role of salicylic acid in regulating NPR1-dependent gene expression. Moreover, our structure of the TGA32–NPR12–TGA32 complex, DNA-binding assay and genetic data show that dimeric NPR1 activates transcription by bridging two fatty-acid-bound TGA3 dimers to form an enhanceosome. The stepwise assembly of the NPR1–TGA complex suggests possible hetero-oligomeric complex formation with other transcription factors, revealing how NPR1 reprograms the defence transcriptome. Cryo-electron microscopy and crystal structures of Arabidopsis NPR1—a bird-shaped homodimer—and its complex with the transcription factor TGA3 provide an explanation for a direct role of salicylic acid and enhanceosome assembly in regulating NPR1-dependent gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W4280605846,"Abstract Immunotherapies have achieved remarkable successes in the treatment of cancer, but major challenges remain 1,2 . An inherent weakness of current treatment approaches is that therapeutically targeted pathways are not restricted to tumours, but are also found in other tissue microenvironments, complicating treatment 3,4 . Despite great efforts to define inflammatory processes in the tumour microenvironment, the understanding of tumour-unique immune alterations is limited by a knowledge gap regarding the immune cell populations in inflamed human tissues. Here, in an effort to identify such tumour-enriched immune alterations, we used complementary single-cell analysis approaches to interrogate the immune infiltrate in human head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and site-matched non-malignant, inflamed tissues. Our analysis revealed a large overlap in the composition and phenotype of immune cells in tumour and inflamed tissues. Computational analysis identified tumour-enriched immune cell interactions, one of which yields a large population of regulatory T (T reg ) cells that is highly enriched in the tumour and uniquely identified among all haematopoietically-derived cells in blood and tissue by co-expression of ICOS and IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL1R1). We provide evidence that these intratumoural IL1R1 + T reg cells had responded to antigen recently and demonstrate that they are clonally expanded with superior suppressive function compared with IL1R1 − T reg cells. In addition to identifying extensive immunological congruence between inflamed tissues and tumours as well as tumour-specific changes with direct disease relevance, our work also provides a blueprint for extricating disease-specific changes from general inflammation-associated patterns."
https://openalex.org/W4280553575,"Light-driven electronic excitation is a cornerstone for energy and information transfer. In the interaction of intense and ultrafast light fields with solids, electrons may be excited irreversibly, or transiently during illumination only. As the transient electron population cannot be observed after the light pulse is gone, it is referred to as virtual, whereas the population that remains excited is called real1-4. Virtual charge carriers have recently been associated with high-harmonic generation and transient absorption5-8, but photocurrent generation may stem from real as well as virtual charge carriers9-14. However, a link between the generation of the carrier types and their importance for observables of technological relevance is missing. Here we show that real and virtual charge carriers can be excited and disentangled in the optical generation of currents in a gold-graphene-gold heterostructure using few-cycle laser pulses. Depending on the waveform used for photoexcitation, real carriers receive net momentum and propagate to the gold electrodes, whereas virtual carriers generate a polarization response read out at the gold-graphene interfaces. On the basis of these insights, we further demonstrate a proof of concept of a logic gate for future lightwave electronics. Our results offer a direct means to monitor and excite real and virtual charge carriers. Individual control over each type of carrier will markedly increase the integrated-circuit design space and bring petahertz signal processing closer to reality15,16."

https://openalex.org/W4280507428,"Abstract Theoretical modelling predicts very unusual structures and properties of materials at extreme pressure and temperature conditions 1,2 . Hitherto, their synthesis and investigation above 200 gigapascals have been hindered both by the technical complexity of ultrahigh-pressure experiments and by the absence of relevant in situ methods of materials analysis. Here we report on a methodology developed to enable experiments at static compression in the terapascal regime with laser heating. We apply this method to realize pressures of about 600 and 900 gigapascals in a laser-heated double-stage diamond anvil cell 3 , producing a rhenium–nitrogen alloy and achieving the synthesis of rhenium nitride Re 7 N 3 —which, as our theoretical analysis shows, is only stable under extreme compression. Full chemical and structural characterization of the materials, realized using synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction on microcrystals in situ, demonstrates the capabilities of the methodology to extend high-pressure crystallography to the terapascal regime."
https://openalex.org/W4280559897,"Mutations in the germline generates all evolutionary genetic variation and is a cause of genetic disease. Parental age is the primary determinant of the number of new germline mutations in an individual's genome1,2. Here we analysed the genome-wide sequences of 21,879 families with rare genetic diseases and identified 12 individuals with a hypermutated genome with between two and seven times more de novo single-nucleotide variants than expected. In most families (9 out of 12), the excess mutations came from the father. Two families had genetic drivers of germline hypermutation, with fathers carrying damaging genetic variation in DNA-repair genes. For five of the families, paternal exposure to chemotherapeutic agents before conception was probably a key driver of hypermutation. Our results suggest that the germline is well protected from mutagenic effects, hypermutation is rare, the number of excess mutations is relatively modest and most individuals with a hypermutated genome will not have a genetic disease."
https://openalex.org/W4280519745,"Abstract The liver takes up bile salts from blood to generate bile, enabling absorption of lipophilic nutrients and excretion of metabolites and drugs 1 . Human Na + –taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) is the main bile salt uptake system in liver. NTCP is also the cellular entry receptor of human hepatitis B and D viruses 2,3 (HBV/HDV), and has emerged as an important target for antiviral drugs 4 . However, the molecular mechanisms underlying NTCP transport and viral receptor functions remain incompletely understood. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of human NTCP in complexes with nanobodies, revealing key conformations of its transport cycle. NTCP undergoes a conformational transition opening a wide transmembrane pore that serves as the transport pathway for bile salts, and exposes key determinant residues for HBV/HDV binding to the outside of the cell. A nanobody that stabilizes pore closure and inward-facing states impairs recognition of the HBV/HDV receptor-binding domain preS1, demonstrating binding selectivity of the viruses for open-to-outside over inward-facing conformations of the NTCP transport cycle. These results provide molecular insights into NTCP ‘gated-pore’ transport and HBV/HDV receptor recognition mechanisms, and are expected to help with development of liver disease therapies targeting NTCP."
https://openalex.org/W4280525469,"Although germline mutation rates and spectra can vary within and between species, common genetic modifiers of the mutation rate have not been identified in nature1. Here we searched for loci that influence germline mutagenesis using a uniquely powerful resource: a panel of recombinant inbred mouse lines known as the BXD, descended from the laboratory strains C57BL/6J (B haplotype) and DBA/2J (D haplotype). Each BXD lineage has been maintained by brother-sister mating in the near absence of natural selection, accumulating de novo mutations for up to 50 years on a known genetic background that is a unique linear mosaic of B and D haplotypes2. We show that mice inheriting D haplotypes at a quantitative trait locus on chromosome 4 accumulate C>A germline mutations at a 50% higher rate than those inheriting B haplotypes, primarily owing to the activity of a C>A-dominated mutational signature known as SBS18. The B and D quantitative trait locus haplotypes encode different alleles of Mutyh, a DNA repair gene that underlies the heritable cancer predisposition syndrome that causes colorectal tumors with a high SBS18 mutation load3,4. Both B and D Mutyh alleles are present in wild populations of Mus musculus domesticus, providing evidence that common genetic variation modulates germline mutagenesis in a model mammalian species."
https://openalex.org/W4280573520,"The adiabatic theorem, a corollary of the Schrödinger equation, manifests itself in a profoundly different way in non-Hermitian arrangements, resulting in counterintuitive state transfer schemes that have no counterpart in closed quantum systems. In particular, the dynamical encirclement of exceptional points (EPs) in parameter space has been shown to lead to a chiral phase accumulation, non-adiabatic jumps and topological mode conversion1-8. Recent theoretical studies, however, have shown that contrary to previously established demonstrations, this behaviour is not strictly a result of winding around a non-Hermitian degeneracy9. Instead, it seems to be mostly attributed to the non-trivial landscape of the Riemann surfaces, sometimes because of the presence of an EP in the vicinity9-11. Here, in an effort to bring this counterintuitive aspect of non-Hermitian systems to light and confirm this hypothesis, we provide a set of experiments to directly observe the field evolution and chiral state conversion in an EP-excluding cycle in a slowly varying non-Hermitian system. To do so, a versatile yet unique fibre-based photonic emulator is realized that utilizes the polarization degrees of freedom in a quasi-common-path single-ring arrangement. Our observations may open up new avenues for light manipulation and state conversion, as well as providing a foundation for understanding the intricacies of the adiabatic theorem in non-Hermitian systems."
https://openalex.org/W4280554797,"Parthanatos-associated apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) nuclease (PAAN), also known as macrophage migration inhibitor factor (MIF), is a member of the PD-D/E(X)K nucleases that acts as a final executioner in parthanatos. PAAN's role in Parkinson's disease (PD) and whether it is amenable to chemical inhibition is not known. Here, we show that neurodegeneration induced by pathologic α-synuclein (α-syn) occurs via PAAN/MIF nuclease activity. Genetic depletion of PAAN/MIF and a mutant lacking nuclease activity prevent the loss of dopaminergic neurons and behavioral deficits in the α-syn preformed fibril (PFF) mouse model of sporadic PD. Compound screening led to the identification of PAANIB-1, a brain-penetrant PAAN/MIF nuclease inhibitor that prevents neurodegeneration induced by α-syn PFF, AAV-α-syn overexpression, or MPTP intoxication in vivo. Our findings could have broad relevance in human pathologies where parthanatos plays a role in the development of cell death inhibitors targeting the druggable PAAN/MIF nuclease."
https://openalex.org/W4280527618,"Cellular diversification is critical for specialized functions of the brain including learning and memory1. Single-cell RNA sequencing facilitates transcriptomic profiling of distinct major types of neuron2–4, but the divergence of transcriptomic profiles within a neuronal population and their link to function remain poorly understood. Here we isolate nuclei tagged5 in specific cell types followed by single-nucleus RNA sequencing to profile Purkinje neurons and map their responses to motor activity and learning. We find that two major subpopulations of Purkinje neurons, identified by expression of the genes Aldoc and Plcb4, bear distinct transcriptomic features. Plcb4+, but not Aldoc+, Purkinje neurons exhibit robust plasticity of gene expression in mice subjected to sensorimotor and learning experience. In vivo calcium imaging and optogenetic perturbation reveal that Plcb4+ Purkinje neurons have a crucial role in associative learning. Integrating single-nucleus RNA sequencing datasets with weighted gene co-expression network analysis uncovers a learning gene module that includes components of FGFR2 signalling in Plcb4+ Purkinje neurons. Knockout of Fgfr2 in Plcb4+ Purkinje neurons in mice using CRISPR disrupts motor learning. Our findings define how diversification of Purkinje neurons is linked to their responses in motor learning and provide a foundation for understanding their differential vulnerability to neurological disorders. Subpopulations of Purkinje neurons display distinct transcriptomic responses and functions in associative learning."
https://openalex.org/W4280495797,"Novae are caused by runaway thermonuclear burning in the hydrogen-rich envelopes of accreting white dwarfs, which leads to a rapid expansion of the envelope and the ejection of most of its mass1,2. Theory has predicted the existence of a 'fireball' phase following directly on from the runaway fusion, which should be observable as a short, bright and soft X-ray flash before the nova becomes visible in the optical3-5. Here we report observations of a bright and soft X-ray flash associated with the classical Galactic nova YZ Reticuli 11 h before its 9 mag optical brightening. No X-ray source was detected 4 h before and after the event, constraining the duration of the flash to shorter than 8 h. In agreement with theoretical predictions4,6-8, the source's spectral shape is consistent with a black-body of 3.27+0.11-0.33 × 105 K (28.2+0.9-2.8 eV), or a white dwarf atmosphere, radiating at the Eddington luminosity, with a photosphere that is only slightly larger than a typical white dwarf."
https://openalex.org/W4280534777,"Abstract Missense driver mutations in cancer are concentrated in a few hotspots 1 . Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain this skew, including biased mutational processes 2 , phenotypic differences 3–6 and immunoediting of neoantigens 7,8 ; however, to our knowledge, no existing model weighs the relative contribution of these features to tumour evolution. We propose a unified theoretical ‘free fitness’ framework that parsimoniously integrates multimodal genomic, epigenetic, transcriptomic and proteomic data into a biophysical model of the rate-limiting processes underlying the fitness advantage conferred on cancer cells by driver gene mutations. Focusing on TP53 , the most mutated gene in cancer 1 , we present an inference of mutant p53 concentration and demonstrate that TP53 hotspot mutations optimally solve an evolutionary trade-off between oncogenic potential and neoantigen immunogenicity. Our model anticipates patient survival in The Cancer Genome Atlas and patients with lung cancer treated with immunotherapy as well as the age of tumour onset in germline carriers of TP53 variants. The predicted differential immunogenicity between hotspot mutations was validated experimentally in patients with cancer and in a unique large dataset of healthy individuals. Our data indicate that immune selective pressure on TP53 mutations has a smaller role in non-cancerous lesions than in tumours, suggesting that targeted immunotherapy may offer an early prophylactic opportunity for the former. Determining the relative contribution of immunogenicity and oncogenic function to the selective advantage of hotspot mutations thus has important implications for both precision immunotherapies and our understanding of tumour evolution."
https://openalex.org/W4280512127,"Death is defined as the irreversible cessation of circulatory, respiratory or brain activity. Many peripheral human organs can be transplanted from deceased donors using protocols to optimize viability. However, tissues from the central nervous system rapidly lose viability after circulation ceases1,2, impeding their potential for transplantation. The time course and mechanisms causing neuronal death and the potential for revival remain poorly defined. Here, using the retina as a model of the central nervous system, we systemically examine the kinetics of death and neuronal revival. We demonstrate the swift decline of neuronal signalling and identify conditions for reviving synchronous in vivo-like trans-synaptic transmission in postmortem mouse and human retina. We measure light-evoked responses in human macular photoreceptors in eyes removed up to 5 h after death and identify modifiable factors that drive reversible and irreversible loss of light signalling after death. Finally, we quantify the rate-limiting deactivation reaction of phototransduction, a model G protein signalling cascade, in peripheral and macular human and macaque retina. Our approach will have broad applications and impact by enabling transformative studies in the human central nervous system, raising questions about the irreversibility of neuronal cell death, and providing new avenues for visual rehabilitation. Experiments measuring light-evoked responses in postmortem mouse and human retinas are used to quantify decay of photoreceptors following death and optimise conditions for reviving trans-synaptic transmission."

Community members are empowered to understand and describe obesity causation, identify and prioritise possible solutions. The application of such approaches to childhood obesity is in its infancy.To describe the first 12 months of a participatory whole-of-community systems approach to creating collective action to tackle childhood obesity, called GenR8 Change, in a local government area of Victoria, Australia.Three group model building (GMB) sessions focused on the development of a causal loop diagram (CLD), prioritised evidence-informed actions, and developed implementation strategies. The collective impact framework underpinned the approach, with a local backbone group supporting community members to implement prioritised actions.The first two GMB sessions included 20 key community leaders where a CLD examining the factors contributing to childhood obesity in the community was constructed and refined (22 variables GMB1, 53 variables GMB2). In the third session, 171 members of the wider community further refined the CLD, identified priorities for childhood obesity prevention (72 variables in final CLD). One-hundred and thirteen individuals signed up across 13 working groups to plan and implement 53 prioritised actions. Agreed community actions included creating sugar free zones; developing healthy policies; increasing breastfeeding rates; improving drinking water access; and increasing physical activity options. Twelve months post-GMB3, 115 actions had been implemented.GenR8 Change is one of the first communities to apply systems thinking to childhood obesity prevention. Knowledge on how to collectively identify relevant leverage points to tackle childhood obesity can now be shared with other communities."
https://openalex.org/W4280549598,"Social gaze interaction powerfully shapes interpersonal communication. However, compared with social perception, very little is known about the neuronal underpinnings of real-life social gaze interaction. Here, we studied a large number of neurons spanning four regions in primate prefrontal-amygdala networks and demonstrate robust single-cell foundations of interactive social gaze in the orbitofrontal, dorsomedial prefrontal, and anterior cingulate cortices, in addition to the amygdala. Many neurons in these areas exhibited high temporal heterogeneity for social discriminability, with a selectivity bias for looking at a conspecific compared with an object. Notably, a large proportion of neurons in each brain region parametrically tracked the gaze of self or other, providing substrates for social gaze monitoring. Furthermore, several neurons displayed selective encoding of mutual eye contact in an agent-specific manner. These findings provide evidence of widespread implementations of interactive social gaze neurons in the primate prefrontal-amygdala networks during social gaze interaction."

https://openalex.org/W4280574190,"Rapid and reliable estimation of large earthquake magnitude (above 8) is key to mitigating the risks associated with strong shaking and tsunamis1. Standard early warning systems based on seismic waves fail to rapidly estimate the size of such large earthquakes2-5. Geodesy-based approaches provide better estimations, but are also subject to large uncertainties and latency associated with the slowness of seismic waves. Recently discovered speed-of-light prompt elastogravity signals (PEGS) have raised hopes that these limitations may be overcome6,7, but have not been tested for operational early warning. Here we show that PEGS can be used in real time to track earthquake growth instantaneously after the event reaches a certain magnitude. We develop a deep learning model that leverages the information carried by PEGS recorded by regional broadband seismometers in Japan before the arrival of seismic waves. After training on a database of synthetic waveforms augmented with empirical noise, we show that the algorithm can instantaneously track an earthquake source time function on real data. Our model unlocks 'true real-time' access to the rupture evolution of large earthquakes using a portion of seismograms that is routinely treated as noise, and can be immediately transformative for tsunami early warning."
https://openalex.org/W4280528809,"Recent models of spiking neuronal networks have been trained to perform behaviors in static environments using a variety of learning rules, with varying degrees of biological realism. Most of these models have not been tested in dynamic visual environments where models must make predictions on future states and adjust their behavior accordingly. The models using these learning rules are often treated as black boxes, with little analysis on circuit architectures and learning mechanisms supporting optimal performance. Here we developed visual/motor spiking neuronal network models and trained them to play a virtual racket-ball game using several reinforcement learning algorithms inspired by the dopaminergic reward system. We systematically investigated how different architectures and circuit-motifs (feed-forward, recurrent, feedback) contributed to learning and performance. We also developed a new biologically-inspired learning rule that significantly enhanced performance, while reducing training time. Our models included visual areas encoding game inputs and relaying the information to motor areas, which used this information to learn to move the racket to hit the ball. Neurons in the early visual area relayed information encoding object location and motion direction across the network. Neuronal association areas encoded spatial relationships between objects in the visual scene. Motor populations received inputs from visual and association areas representing the dorsal pathway. Two populations of motor neurons generated commands to move the racket up or down. Model-generated actions updated the environment and triggered reward or punishment signals that adjusted synaptic weights so that the models could learn which actions led to reward. Here we demonstrate that our biologically-plausible learning rules were effective in training spiking neuronal network models to solve problems in dynamic environments. We used our models to dissect the circuit architectures and learning rules most effective for learning. Our model shows that learning mechanisms involving different neural circuits produce similar performance in sensory-motor tasks. In biological networks, all learning mechanisms may complement one another, accelerating the learning capabilities of animals. Furthermore, this also highlights the resilience and redundancy in biological systems."

It is becoming the most commonly recognized cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in under-five mortality in recent years. This study was done to determine the prevalence and determinants of Campylobacter infection among under-fives with acute watery diarrhea.This institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted at governmental and private health institutions in Hawassa city. All outpatient under-five children who met the inclusion criteria from April 2021 to August 2021 were enrolled in this study. Demographic and clinical data were obtained using a standardized data collection tool. Stool samples were collected from each participant with a sterile container and inoculated on a campylobacter agar media. The isolates were identified by using biochemical tests and a disc diffusion technique was performed to determine the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the isolates. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 21. Descriptive and Logistic regression analysis was applied to determine the determinants of Campylobacter infection. P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.A total of 235 under-five children were enrolled in this study with a 100% response rate. Of these 130 (55.3%) and 105(44.7%) were males and females respectively with the age range of 2 months to 60 months with the mean age of 25 months. The majority of the 150 (63.2%) were rural residents. Of 235 under-fives with acute watery diarrhea, 16 (6.8%) patients were found to have Campylobacter infection with (95% CI, 3.8-10.2%). Consumption of pasteurized milk (AOR: 0.12; 95% CI 0.02-0.75, P<0.05), presence of domestic animals like cats, hens, and cows (AOR: 0.09: 95% CI 0.01-0.67, P<0.05), absence of handwashing practice before food preparation (AOR: 3.63, 95% CI 1.15-11.46, P<0.05) showed significant association with campylobacter infection. The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the isolated bacteria were 100% sensitivity to Azithromycin, Chloramphenicol, and Gentamicin, however; it was 100% resistant to Cephalothin. The associations of socio-demographic, environmental, and behavioral factors were compared and consumption of unpasteurized milk, the presence of domestic animal like the cat was significantly associated.Campylobacter infection showed a comparatively low prevalence in under-fives with acute watery diarrhea. In this study contact with cats, consumption of unpasteurized milk were associated with Campylobacter infection. The treatment approach of Campylobacter infection must consider the sensitivity profile of antibiotics as indicated in the study. We, therefore, recommend further studies to determine the species responsible for Campylobacter infection with other co-morbidities and the susceptibility pattern for each species to indicate appropriate antibiotic therapy."

The results indicate that the increasing of income inequality significantly restrained the increase of household consumption, while the moderate increase of household leverage can promote household consumption to a certain extent. According to the conclusion of this article, in order to realize the sustainable growth of consumption and upgrade of structure, the government should take measures to stimulate domestic demand: (1) For the central and western regions, the overall wealth level of households should be improved and the borrowing level of residents should be appropriately increased; (2) For the eastern region, the income inequality should be controlled and reduced the negative effects of income inequality on sustainable consumption growth. This research provides evidence for understanding the relationship between income inequality, household leverage ratio and consumption, and sheds light on the formulation of related policies."
https://openalex.org/W4280579803,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections. The global emergence of multidrug-resistant uropathogens in the last decade underlines the need to search for new antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action. In this regard, exploring endophytic fungi inhabiting medicinal plants used locally against urinary tract infections could be a promising strategy for novel drug discovery. This study investigates crude metabolites from endophytic fungi isolated from Annona muricata as potential sources of antibiotic drugs to fight against uropathogens and reduce related oxidative stress. Crude ethyl acetate extracts from 41 different endophytic fungi were screened against three bacterial strains using the broth microdilution method, and fungi producing active crude extracts were identified using ITS1-5.8S rRNA-ITS2 nucleotide sequences. The antibacterial modes of action of the five most active extracts were evaluated using Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300 and Klebsiella oxytoca strains. The DPPH and FRAP assays were used to investigate their antioxidant activity, and their cytotoxicity against the Vero cell line was evaluated using the MTT assay. Out of the 41 crude extracts tested, 17 were active with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 3.125 μg/mL to 100 μg/mL and were not cytotoxic against Vero cell lines with a cytotoxic concentration 50 (CC 50 ) &gt;100 μg/mL. The more potent extracts (from Fusarium waltergamsii AMtw3, Aspergillus sp. AMtf15, Penicillium citrinum AMf6, Curvularia sp. AMf4, and Talaromyces annesophieae AMsb23) significantly inhibited bacterial catalase activity, lysed bacterial cells, increased outer membrane permeability, and inhibited biofilm formation, and the time-kill kinetic assay revealed concentration-dependent bactericidal activity. All seventeen extracts showed weak ferric iron-reducing power (1.06 to 12.37 μg equivalent NH 2 OH/g of extract). In comparison, seven extracts exhibited DPPH free radical scavenging activity, with RSA 50 ranging from 146.05 to 799.75 μg/mL. The molecular identification of the seventeen active fungi revealed that they belong to six distinct genera, including Aspergillus , Curvularia , Fusarium , Meyerozyma , Penicillium , and Talaromyces . This investigation demonstrated that fungal endophytes from Cameroonian Annona muricata , a medicinal plant used locally to treat bacterial infections, might contain potent antibacterial metabolites with multiple modes of action. The antibacterial-guided fractionation of these active extracts is currently ongoing to purify and characterise potential antibacterial active ingredients."
https://openalex.org/W4280608948,"Introduction Local soft tissue status (STS) guides the timing for definitive surgical treatment strategies of fracture fixation around the ankle joint. The aim of this study was to assess different types of new technical devices in relation to the surgical treatment in closed ankle and pilon fractures. Methods This study was designed as a cohort study. Adult patients admitted between February 1, 2019 and December 31, 2020 presenting with closed ankle fracture requiring surgical treatment were eligible. The exclusion criteria were previous injuries to the lower extremity, acute deep venous thrombosis, skin diseases, and delayed presentation (admission &gt;24 hours after injury). Moderate-energy trauma includes injuries sustained during team sports, biking, and running. The primary outcome was the assessment of the degree of soft tissue involvement following closed fractures by comparing different techniques focusing on the ankle region and including ankle and pilon fractures. The variables of interest included the circumference of soft tissue swelling around the ankle, determined within a 5-mm range in the area of the medial and lateral malleolus and the bone-skin distance on a plain radiograph, determined by the largest distance from the malleolus to the border of the soft-tissue shadow. STS assessment included optical measures of local perfusion (O2C, Lea Inc. Germany) and tactile measures of mechanical characteristics (Myoton ® tensiometer AS, Estonia). Measurements of Group Temp (temporary stabilization) and Group Def (definitive surgery) were taken on admission and prior to the treatment strategy decision. The contralateral non-injured ankle served as a control. The quality of assessment tools was quantified by calculating the smallest detectable change (SDC). Results In total, 38 patients with a mean age of 40.4 (SD 17.8) years were included. The SDC was 3.2% (95%CI 2.5 to 3.8) for local blood flow and 1.1% (95%CI 0.4 to 1.7) for soft tissue stiffness. The circumference of the injured area at admission was significantly higher than that of the healthy site (28.2 [SD 3.4] cm versus 23.9 [SD 2.4] cm, p &lt; 0.001). The local perfusion (blood flow 107.5 (SD 40.79 A.U. vs. 80.1 [SD 13.8] A.U., p = 0.009), and local dynamic stiffness of the skin (668.1 (SD 148.0) N/m vs 449.5 (SD 87.7) N/m, p &lt; 0.001) were significantly higher at the injured site. In Group Temp, the local blood flow was significantly higher when compared with Group Def (109.6 [SD 39.8] vs. 94.5 [SD 13.0], p = 0.023). The dynamic stiffness of the soft tissue was significantly higher in Group Temp (679.4 N/m [SD 147.0] N/m vs. 573.0 N/m (SD 93.8) N/m, p &lt; 0.001). The physical properties of STS were comparable among the fracture types. None of the included patients had local soft tissue complications. Conclusion Closed fractures of the ankle and the pilon are associated with an increase in local circulation and local soft tissue stiffness and tension. These changes of the STS following injury can be quantified in a standardized and reproducible manner."
https://openalex.org/W4280509410,"At present, the global demand for lithium batteries is still in a high growth state, and the traditional lithium battery pole mill control system is still dominated by ARM (Artificial Intelligence Enhanced Computing), DSP (Digital Signal Processing), and other single-chip control methods. There are problems such as poor anti-interference ability and insufficient real-time online analysis of production data. This paper adopts the dual-chip control system architecture based on ""ARM+DSP"", starting from the mechanical characteristics and operating signal features of the pole mill. The hardware system adopts a three-unit joint control hardware structure, which separates the control unit from the data processing unit and improves the operation of the system. The software system adopts fuzzy PID algorithm to realize deflection control and tension control, and verifies that the Fuzzy PID (Proportion Integration Differentiation) control algorithm can effectively improve the anti-interference ability of the deflection system and tension system. The results show that the data loss rate is low with the SPI communication between DSP and ARM. The tension error of the ""ARM+DSP"" control system does not exceed 5%, and the deviation of the correction band is within ±4mm. The dedicated dual-chip hardware architecture effectively improves the robustness and operation efficiency of the pole mill, solves the problem of low tension control accuracy, and provides a theoretical basis for the application of the dual-roll mill."
https://openalex.org/W4280583890,"There is evidence from various models of hypoxic-ischemic injury (HII) that nitric oxide (NO) is protective. We hypothesized that either inhaled NO (iNO) or nitrite would alleviate brain injury in neonatal HII via modulation of mitochondrial function.We tested the effects of iNO and nitrite on the Rice-Vannucci model of HII in 7-day-old rats. Brain mitochondria were isolated for flow cytometry, aconitase activity, electron paramagnetic resonance, and Seahorse assays.Pretreatment of pups with iNO decreased survival in the Rice-Vannucci model of HII, while iNO administered post-insult did not. MRI analysis demonstrated that pre-HII iNO at 40 ppm and post-HII iNO at 20 ppm decreased the brain lesion sizes from 6.3±1.3% to 1.0±0.4% and 1.8±0.8%, respectively. Intraperitoneal nitrite at 0.165 μg/g improved neurobehavioral performance but was harmful at higher doses and had no effect on brain infarct size. NO reacted with complex IV at the heme a3 site, decreased the oxidative stress of mitochondria challenged with anoxia and reoxygenation, and suppressed mitochondrial oxygen respiration.This study suggests that iNO administered following neonatal HII may be neuroprotective, possibly via its modulation of mitochondrial function."
https://openalex.org/W4280641274,"Background Suicide is a serious cause of mortality worldwide and is a psychiatric emergency. Among prisoners, it is the leading cause of death compared to the general population. However, suicide in prison is a neglected public health issue especially in middle- and low-income countries including Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of suicidal behavior among prisoners in Dilla Town Correctional Center, South Ethiopia. Methods An institution-based cross- sectional study was conducted from May13- June 13, 2020 in the Dilla Town Correctional Center. The simple random sampling technique was used to select 650 prisoners. Data were collected by face-to—to-face interview. Suicidal ideation and attempts were assessed by using the suicidality module of World Mental Health survey initiative version of the World Health Organization composite International diagnostic interview. Data were coded, entered with EP-data version 3.1, and analyzed by using Statistical Package for Social Science version 24. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine the significant association between explanatory variables and outcome variables at 95% CI. The results The prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempt among prisoners were 21.9% (95%CI, 18.4–25.2) and 13.1% (95%CI, 10.6–15.8), respectively. Female sex [(AOR) = 2.6, 95%CI, (1.39, 8.2)], divorced/widowed [AOR = 3.67, 95%CI, (2.05, 6.58)], family history of mental illness [AOR = 2.49, 95%CI, (1.41, 4.38)], common mental disorder [AOR = 1.98, 95%CI, (1.25, 3.16)] and poor social support [AOR = 2.68, 95%CI, (1.42, 5.06)] were statistically associated with suicidal ideation. Whereas, female sex [AOR = 3.24, 95%CI, (1.89, 9.4)], previous incarceration [AOR = 2.38, 95%CI, (1.2, 5.16)], and family history of mental illness [AOR = 2.08, 95%CI, (1.11, 3.9)] were associated with suicide attempt. Conclusion The prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts among prisoners were high. The special attention in early screening and treatment of suicide among prisoners and collaborating with health institutions is important for better management and prevention."
https://openalex.org/W4280644393,"Despite India’s steady economic growth over recent the period, the burden of childhood malnutrition persists, contributing to higher neonatal and infant mortality. There is limited evidence available to contextualise mothers’ crucial role in childcare practices and health status in the Indian context. This study attempts to assess the association between maternal autonomy and the nutritional status of children under five. We used samples of 38,685 mother-child pairs from the fourth round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), conducted in 2015–16. We considered three widely used indicators of child nutrition as outcome variables: stunting, wasting, and underweight. Maternal autonomy (measured from three dimensions: household decision-making, freedom of physical movement, and access to economic resources/control over assets) was the key predictor variable, and various child demographics, maternal, and household characteristics were considered control variables. Stepwise binary logistic regression models were performed to examine the association. Of study participants, 38%, 21%, and 35% of children were stunted, wasted, and underweight, respectively. Our results (models 1 to 4) indicate that mothers with greater autonomy were significantly associated with lower odds of malnourished children. After controlling for all potential confounding variables (in model 5), maternal autonomy had a statistically insignificant association with children’s stunting (Odds ratio [OR]: 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.87, 1.00) and wasting (OR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.85, 1.00). However, a significant relationship (though marginally) was retained with underweight (OR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.99). In addition, socio-demographic characteristics such as child age, birth order, maternal education, maternal BMI, place of residence and household wealth quintile were found to be strong predictors of child nutritional status. Future policies should not only inform women’s empowerment programmes but also emphasise effective interventions toward improving female educational attainment and nutritional status of women, as well as addressing socioeconomic inequalities in order to combat the persistent burden of childhood malnutrition in India."
https://openalex.org/W4280649205,"Background Skin cancer, including melanoma and non-melanoma (keratinocyte), is increasing in incidence in the UK. Accounting for half of all cancers in England and Wales, the disease significantly impacts overstretched dermatology services. Research suggests that 86% of melanoma is preventable with modified sun exposure. Educating children about sun safety in schools can help prevent skin cancer and is recommended by major health organisations. In England, teaching sun safety in primary schools is compulsory, while in Wales this is left to school discretion. Aims Understand how primary schools in Wales are responding to growing skin cancer rates and explore the effectiveness of sun safety policies in schools on knowledge and behaviour. Methods Sunproofed is a mixed-methods scoping study comprising 5 work packages (WP) using survey and routine electronic health record (EHR) data supplemented by qualitative case studies. Objective(s) are to: WP1: Discover if primary schools in Wales have sun safety policies; policy characteristics; determine factors that may influence their presence and identify areas where schools need support. WP2: Determine what EHR data is available regarding the incidence of sunburn in primary school children and the feasibility of using this data to evaluate the impact of sun safety policies. WP3: Understand the impact of sun safety policies on sun-safe knowledge and behaviour amongst children, parents, teachers, and school management; identify barriers and facilitators to schools implementing sun safety policies. WP4: Co-produce guidance regarding sun safety policies and best methods for implementation in schools. WP5: Disseminate guidance and findings widely to ensure impact and uptake. Discussion Skin cancer rates are increasing in the UK, straining limited resources. Sunproofed has the potential to inform the development of future prevention activities, both in Wales and beyond. This could reduce the number of skin cancer cases in the future and keep people healthier for longer."
https://openalex.org/W4280501297,"Purpose To assess the efficacy of combination chemotherapy with nafamostat mesilate, gemcitabine and S-1 for unresectable pancreatic cancer patients. Materials and methods The study was conducted as a single-arm, single center, institutional review board-approved phase II trial. Patients received nafamosntat mesilate (4.8 mg/kg continuous transregional arterial infusion) with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m 2 transvenous) on days 1 and15, and with oral S-1 [(80 mg/day (BSA&lt;1.25 m 2 ), 100 mg/day (1.25 ≤ BSA&lt;1.5 m 2 ), or 120 mg/day (BSA ≥1.5 m 2 )] on days 1–14 or, days 1–7 and 15–21. This regimen was repeated at 28-day intervals. Results Forty-seven evaluable patients (Male/Female: 31/16, Age (median): 66 (range 35–78) yrs, Stage III/IV 10/37.) were candidates in this study. Two patients in stage III (20%) could undergo conversion surgery. Twenty-four patients (51%) underwent subsequent treatment (1 st line/ 2 nd line / 4 th line, 13/ 10/ 1, FOLFIRINOX: 12, GEM/nab-PTX: 18, TAS-118: 3, chemoradiation with S-1: 2, GEM/Erlotinib: 1, nal-IRI: 1, surgery: 2). Median PFS and OS were 9.7 (95% CI, 8.9–14.7 mo) and 14.2 months (99% CI, 13.3–23.9 mo), respectively. Median PFS in stage IV patients was 9.2 months (95% CI, 8.4–12.0 mo). Median OS in patients without subsequent treatment was 10.8 months (95% CI, 9.1–13.8 mo). Median OS in patients with subsequent treatment was 19.3 months (95% CI, 18.9–31.9 mo). Grade 4 treatment-related hematological toxicities were encountered in 7 patients. Two patients developed grade 3 allergic reaction after 6 cycles or later. No febrile neutropenia has been observed. Conclusion NAM/GEM/S-1 therapy is safe and could be promising option for unresectable pancreatic cancer, especially for stage IV cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4280516115,"Since the recycling of waste original cement-stabilized macadam (OCSM) base has important environmental and economic significance, the addition of emulsified asphalt to OCSM to form emulsified recycled OCSM (ER-OCSM) can improve the flexibility of recycled mixtures. However, the influence of emulsified asphalt on the mechanical performance of such mixtures remains to be investigated. This study presents a gradation design and ER-OCSM established using the step-by-step filling method and investigated the mechanical properties of the ER-OCSM mixture. The apparent characteristics, crushing value and needle-like particle content of the OCSM milling material were tested. Based on step-by-step filling theory, the appropriate test method to achieve a uniform and dense state according to the characteristics of different aggregates was selected, and the dense skeleton gradation design method for recycled cement macadam was obtained. The mechanical properties of the ER-OCSM were analyzed by performing indoor physical laboratory tests. The natural gradation of the OCSM milling material exceeded the gradation range recommended in the Technical Guide for the Promotion of Science and Technology of the Construction Project of the Main Highway in Jiangsu Province (Trial), but the designed gradations were basically within the range. At the same age and temperature, the flexural strength and dynamic elastic modulus of the ER-OCSM decreased gradually with an increase in the emulsified asphalt content. Because ER-OCSM had temperature-sensitive characteristics, the adhesiveness of the asphalt between particles in the mixture decreased with increasing temperature, which was manifested as the unconfined compressive strength, flexural tensile strength and dynamic elastic modulus decreasing with an increase in temperature (the decrease was slight within 5-25°C but noticeable within 25-60°C). Furthermore, a higher emulsified asphalt content caused a more noticeable decrease. The flexural strength of the tested ER-OCSM showed noticeable correlations with the splitting strength, unconfined compressive strength and dynamic elastic modulus. The proper addition of emulsified asphalt can reduce the rigidity of ER-OCSM. However, the emulsified asphalt content should be strictly controlled; otherwise, the mechanical properties of the material will decrease greatly, adversely impacting the comprehensive road use performance."

https://openalex.org/W4280561837,"Background Thoracic endometriosis-related pneumothorax is a secondary spontaneous pneumothorax caused by thoracic endometriosis. Diaphragmatic endometriosis is well-studied, but visceral and/or parietal pleural lesions are not. Although surgery is an effective treatment, postoperative recurrence rates are unsatisfactory probably due to inadequate understanding of underlying pathophysiology. We aimed to clarify the clinicopathological features of thoracic endometriosis. Methods In total, 160 patients who underwent thoracoscopic surgery from a single institution with histopathologically proven thoracic endometriosis from January 2015 to December 2019 were included. Clinicopathological characteristics and surgical outcomes were assessed retrospectively. Results The cohort median age was 41 (range 22–53) years. Pneumothorax was right-sided in 159 (99.4%) and left-sided in only 1 (0.6%) case. Visceral and parietal pleural lesions were diagnosed in 79 (49.4%) and 71 (44.4%) patients, respectively. In total, 104 visceral pleural lesions and 101 parietal pleural lesions were detected. The S 4 region and the dorsal 6 th intercostal space contained the largest number of visceral pleural (66 lesions) and parietal pleural lesions (25 lesions), respectively. Histopathological evaluation revealed endometriotic tissues, existing in the outer external elastic layer in all lesions, were localized or invaded deeply. The median follow-up period was 370 (range, 6–1824) days. The Kaplan-Meier method revealed that the 1- and 2-year postoperative recurrence rates were 13.8% and 19.3%, respectively. Conclusions Visceral pleural endometriotic lesions may be disseminated from the visceral pleural surface and infiltrate into the pleura. Intraoperatively, careful observation of the specific sites, such as the visceral pleura of S 4 and the parietal pleura of 6 th intercostal space, is important to reduce postoperative recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W4280564778,"Understanding the determinants of the shadow economy plays a vital role in formulating policies for economic growth and development, particularly for the Southeast Asian countries–a new economic force for a global economy. The key drivers of a shadow economy, such as institutional quality, taxation, government expenditure, are widely examined. However, the effect of national intellectual capital, which affects macroeconomic indicators, on the shadow economy has largely been ignored in the existing literature. Our paper examines this critical link and its causality relationship for eight Southeast Asian countries from 2000 to 2017. This paper uses the dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) and fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS), which allow cross-sectional dependence and slope homogeneity in panel data analysis. Empirical findings from this paper indicate that national intellectual capital impacts negatively and significantly the shadow economy size. This finding implies that enhancing national intellectual capital reduces the shadow economy size. These two forces lead to enhanced economic growth. Our Granger causality tests confirm a bi-directional relationship between national intellectual capital and the shadow economy. As a result, policies targeted to reduce the shadow economy size can now include the accumulation of national intellectual capital, particularly for Southeast Asian Countries."

Four steps were covered: 1) Analysis of content validity of each indicator (relevance and adequacy); 2) Analysis of reliability via intra and inter-rater agreement of each indicator; 3) Analysis of the utility of each indicator; 4) Construction and analysis of the reliability of a weighted composite indicator based on effectiveness and safety scores for each indicator.Twenty-nine potential indicators were listed, but only 13 were approved for validity, reliability and usefulness. Twelve indicators were excluded because of validity (<90% validity index) and four because they were not useful in the context of the study. Three weighted composite indicators were tested, but only one was approved for reliability and usefulness. The validated instrument therefore contains 13 indicators and 1 weighted composite indicator.This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and usefulness of QualiPresc for the evaluation of prescription writing in the context of primary care. Application to contexts such as secondary care and tertiary care requires cross-cultural adaptation and new content validity. Educators, managers and health care professionals can access QualiPresc online, free of charge, to assess performance and provide feedback involving drug prescribers."
https://openalex.org/W4280609498,"Purpose Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor which seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, studies on intraocular ET-1 in DR have been limited. Thus, we investigated aqueous ET-1 levels in patients with DR. Methods A total 85 subjects were included in this prospective study. Those were classified into three groups: advanced DR group included those with severe nonproliferative DR or proliferative DR, whereas early DR group included those with mild nonproliferative DR or moderative nonproliferative DR. Those who underwent cataract surgery and had no concomitant ocular disease were included in the control group. Aqueous humor levels of ET-1 were obtained before intravitreal bevacizumab injection (IVB) and after 1 month for the DR patients, and at the time of cataract surgery for the control group. Results Advanced DR group included 40 eyes (47.1%), whereas early DR group did 19 eyes (22.4%), and control group (26 eyes, 30.5%). Mean aqueous ET-1 level was 10.1±4.1 pg/mL (6.0–21.0 pg/mL) in advanced DR group, 1.9±0.7 pg/mL (0.6–2.8 pg/mL) in early DR group, and 2.1±1.0 pg/mL (0.7–3.9 pg/mL) in control group (P &lt; 0.001). Advanced DR group was further subdivided into severe nonproliferative DR (15 eyes, 12.8%) and proliferative DR (25 eyes, 34.3%). Mean aqueous ET-1 level was 10.1±4.3 pg/mL (6.0–20.1 pg/mL) in patients with severe nonproliferative DR, and 10.0±4.0 pg/mL (6.0–21.0 pg/mL) in those with proliferative DR (P = 0.928) at baseline. Mean ET-1 level at 1 month after intravitreal injection was 2.5±1.0 pg/mL (0.3–4.8 pg/mL) in patients with severe proliferative DR and 2.9±1.7 pg/mL (1.0–7.0 pg/mL) in those with proliferative DR (P = 0.443). Mean aqueous ET-1 level was significantly reduced in both groups (P &lt; 0.001, respectively). Conclusion The mean aqueous ET-1 level was significantly higher in the eyes with advanced DR than those with early DR and the control group. The mean aqueous ET-1 level was significantly reduced after intravitreal injections in the advanced DR group. Based on our results, future studies on the exact role of ET-1 in the pathogenesis of DR and future implication for intervention would be helpful for managing DR."
https://openalex.org/W4280624939,"This study aimed to quantify the inequalities and identify the associated factors of the UN sustainable development goal (SDG) targets in relation to safe drinking water. The concentration of the gut bacterium Escherichia coli in drinking water at the point of use (POU) and other information were extracted from the latest wave of the nationally representative Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS 2019). Bivariate and multivariable multinomial logistic regression models were used to identify potential predictors of contamination, whereas, classification trees were used to determine specific combinations of background characteristics with significantly higher rates of contamination. A higher risk of contamination from drinking water was observed for households categorized as middle or low wealth who collected water from sources with higher concentrations of E. coli. Treatment of drinking water significantly reduced the risk of higher levels of contamination, whereas owning a pet was significantly associated with recontamination. Regional differences in the concentrations of E. coli present in drinking water were also observed. Interventions in relation to water sources should emphasize reducing the level of E. coli contamination. Our results may help in developing effective policies for reducing diarrheal diseases by reducing water contamination risks."

https://openalex.org/W4280538561,"The coronavirus pandemic has led to increased use of digital teaching formats in medical education. A number of studies have assessed student satisfaction with these resources. However, there is a lack of studies investigating changes in student performance following the switch from contact to virtual teaching. Specifically, there are no studies linking student use of digital resources to learning outcome and examining predictors of failure.Student performance before (winter term 2019/20: contact teaching) and during (summer term 2020: no contact teaching) the pandemic was compared prospectively in a cohort of 162 medical students enrolled in the clinical phase of a five-year undergraduate curriculum. Use of and performance in various digital resources (case-based teaching in a modified flipped classroom approach; formative key feature examinations of clinical reasoning; daily multiple choice quizzes) was recorded in summer 2020. Student scores in summative examinations were compared to examination scores in the previous term. Associations between student characteristics, resource use and summative examination results were used to identify predictors of performance.Not all students made complete use of the digital learning resources provided. Timely completion of tasks was associated with superior performance compared to delayed completion. Female students scored significantly fewer points in formative key feature examinations and digital quizzes. Overall, higher rankings within the student cohort (according to summative exams) in winter term 2019/20 as well as male gender predicted summative exam performance in summer 2020. Scores achieved in the first formative key feature examination predicted summative end-of-module exam scores.The association between timely completion of tasks as well as early performance in a module and summative exams might help to identify students at risk and offering help early on. The unexpected gender difference requires further study to determine whether the shift to a digital-only curriculum disadvantages female students."
https://openalex.org/W4280557529,"Limited information and resources have caused many parks and protected areas (PPAs) to functionally manage recreationists as a single homogeneous group, despite potential negative social and ecological consequences. We aimed to evaluate the homogeneity of recreationists at the Valentine National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) by 1) quantifying frequencies of consumptive (i.e., hunting), intermediate-consumptive (i.e., fishing), and non-consumptive recreational-activity groups (e.g., wildlife viewing), and 2) evaluating sociodemographic differences among these groups. We used onsite surveys to determine that Valentine NWR supports heterogeneous groups of recreationists. The intermediate-consumptive group was most frequent (77% of all parties). All three recreational-activity groups varied in party size, distance traveled, household income, population type (urban or rural residence), and vehicle type (two-wheel or four-wheel drive). Tracking and accounting for diverse recreationists will equip managers with the ability to sustain recreational activities while also preserving ecological systems."
https://openalex.org/W4280566751,"Background In 2017, San Francisco’s initiative to locally eliminate hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a public health threat, End Hep C SF , generated an estimate of city-wide HCV prevalence in 2015, but only incorporated limited information about population HCV treatment. Using additional data and updated methods, we aimed to update the 2015 estimate to 2019 and provide a more accurate estimate of the number of people with untreated, active HCV infection overall and in key subgroups–people who inject drugs (PWID), men who have sex with men (MSM), and low socioeconomic status transgender women (low SES TW). Methods Our estimates are based on triangulation of data from blood bank testing records, cross-sectional and longitudinal observational studies, and published literature. We calculated subpopulation estimates based on biological sex, age and/or HCV risk group. When multiple sources of data were available for subpopulation estimates, we calculated an average using inverse variance weighting. Plausible ranges (PRs) were conservatively estimated to convey uncertainty. Results The total number of people estimated to have anti-HCV antibodies in San Francisco in 2019 was 22,585 (PR:12,014–44,152), with a citywide seroprevalence of 2.6% (PR:1.4%–5.0%)–similar to the 2015 estimate of 21,758 (PR:10,274–42,067). Of all people with evidence of past or present infection, an estimated 11,582 (PR:4,864–35,094) still had untreated, active HCV infection, representing 51.3% (PR:40.5%–79.5%) of all people with anti-HCV antibodies, and 1.3% (PR:0.6%–4.0%) of all San Franciscans. PWID comprised an estimated 2.8% of the total population of San Francisco, yet 73.1% of people with anti-HCV antibodies and 90.4% (n = 10,468, PR:4,690–17,628) of untreated, active HCV infections were among PWID. MSM comprised 7.8% of the total population, yet 11.7% of people with anti-HCV antibodies and 1.0% (n = 119, PR:0–423) of those with untreated active infections. Low SES TW comprised an estimated 0.1% of the total population, yet 1.4% of people with HCV antibodies and 1.6% (n = 183, PR:130–252) of people with untreated active infections. Conclusions Despite the above-average number (2.6%) of people with anti-HCV antibodies, we estimate that only 1.3% (PR:0.6%–4.0%) of all San Francisco residents have untreated, active HCV infection–likely a reflection of San Francisco’s robust efforts to diagnose infection among high-risk groups and initiate curative treatment with as many people as possible. While plausible ranges of infections are wide, these findings indicate that while the overall number of people with anti-HCV antibodies may have increased slightly, the number of people with active HCV infection may have decreased slightly since 2015. This estimate improves upon the 2015 calculations by directly estimating the impact of curative treatment citywide and in subgroups. However, more research is needed to better understand the burden of HCV disease among other subgroups at high risk, such as Blacks/African Americans, people with a history of injection drug use (but not injecting drugs in the last 12 months), people who are currently or formerly incarcerated, and people who are currently or formerly unhoused."
https://openalex.org/W4280579077,"Fine hand movements require the synergistic contraction of intrinsic and extrinsic muscles to achieve them. In this paper, a Finite Element Digital Human Hand Model (FE-DHHM) containing solid tendons and ligaments and driven by the Muscle-Tendon Junction (MTJ) displacements of FDS, FDP and ED measured by ultrasound imaging was developed. The synergistic contraction of these muscles during the finger flexion movements was analyzed by simulating five sets of finger flexion movements. The results showed that the FDS and FDP contracted together to provide power during the flexion movements, while the ED acted as an antagonist. The peak stresses of the FDS, FDP and ED were all at the joints. In the flexion without resistance, the FDS provided the main driving force, and the FDS and FDP alternated in a ""plateau"" of muscle force. In the flexion with resistance, the muscle forces of FDS, FDP, and ED were all positively correlated with fingertip forces. The FDS still provided the main driving force, but the stress maxima occurred in the FDP at the DIP joint."
https://openalex.org/W4280585756,"Inspired Therapeutics (Merritt Island, FL) is developing a mechanical circulatory support (MCS) system designed as a single driver with interchangeable, extracorporeal, magnetically levitated pumps. The NeoMate system design features an integrated centrifugal rotary pump, motor, and controller that will be housed in a single compact unit. Conceptually, the primary innovation of this technology will be the combination of disposable, low-cost pumps for use with a single, multi-functional, universal controller to support multiple pediatric cardiopulmonary indications. In response to the paucity of clinically available pediatric devices, Inspired Therapeutics is specifically targeting the underserved neonate and infant heart failure (HF) patient population first. In this article, we present the development of the prototype Inspired Therapeutics NeoMate System for pediatric left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support, and feasibility testing in static mock flow loops (H-Q curves), dynamic mock flow loops (hemodynamics), and in an acute healthy ovine model (hemodynamics and clinical applicability). The resultant hydrodynamic and hemodynamic data demonstrated the ability of this prototype pediatric LVAD and universal controller to function over a range of rotary pump speeds (500-6000 RPM), to provide pump flow rates of up to 2.6 L/min, and to volume unload the left ventricle in acute animals. Key engineering challenges observed and proposed solutions for the next design iteration are also presented."
https://openalex.org/W4280589106,"Biomarkers common to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) may reflect early impairments underlying both diseases.We evaluated associations of 71 CVD-related plasma proteins measured in 2,873 Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring cohort participants with cross-sectional continuous eGFR and with longitudinal change in eGFR from baseline to follow-up (ΔeGFR). We also evaluated the associations of the 71 CVD proteins with the following dichotomous secondary outcomes: prevalent CKD stage ≥3 (cross-sectional), new-onset CKD stage ≥3 (longitudinal), and rapid decline in eGFR (longitudinal). Proteins significantly associated with eGFR and ΔeGFR were subsequently validated in 3,951 FHS Third Generation cohort participants and were tested using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to infer putatively causal relations between plasma protein biomarkers and kidney function.In cross-sectional analysis, 37 protein biomarkers were significantly associated with eGFR at FDR<0.05 in the FHS Offspring cohort and 20 of these validated in the FHS Third Generation cohort at p<0.05/37. In longitudinal analysis, 27 protein biomarkers were significantly associated with ΔeGFR at FDR<0.05 and 12 of these were validated in the FHS Third Generation cohort at p<0.05/27. Additionally, 35 protein biomarkers were significantly associated with prevalent CKD, five were significantly associated with new-onset CKD, and 17 were significantly associated with rapid decline in eGFR. MR suggested putatively causal relations of melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM; -0.011±0.003 mL/min/1.73m2, p = 5.11E-5) and epidermal growth factor-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (EFEMP1; -0.006±0.002 mL/min/1.73m2, p = 0.0001) concentration with eGFR.Eight protein biomarkers were consistently associated with eGFR in cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis in both cohorts and may capture early kidney impairment; others were implicated in association and causal inference analyses. A subset of CVD protein biomarkers may contribute causally to the pathogenesis of kidney impairment and should be studied as targets for CKD treatment and early prevention."
https://openalex.org/W4280650454,"Background Meningitis remains an important cause of morbi-mortality in adults in sub-Saharan Africa. Data on the etiological investigation of meningitis in adults in Mozambique is limited and most studies were conducted in southern Mozambique. Identification of the etiology of meningitis in adults are crucial to guide prevention and treatments strategies. In this study, we determine the burden of fungal and bacterial meningitis among adults at the three largest hospitals in Mozambique. Method We performed analysis of data from the routine sentinel surveillance system for meningitis in Mozambique from January 2016 to December 2017. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected from eligible adults (≥18 years old) who met World Health Organization (WHO) case definition criteria for Meningitis. All samples were tested by cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) lateral flow assay (LFA), culture and triplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay and all patients were tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) using the national algorithm for HIV testing. Results Retrospective analysis of 1501 CSF samples from adults clinically suspected of meningitis revealed that 10.5% (158/1501) were positive for bacterial and fungal meningitis. Of these 158 confirmed cases, the proportion of Cryptococcal meningitis and pneumococcal meningitis was38.6% (95% CI: 31.0% to 46.7%) and 36.7% (95% CI: 29.2% to 44.7%), respectively. The other bacterial agents of meningitis identified include Neisseria meningitidis (8.9%; 14/158), Escherichia coli (6.3%; 10/158), Haemophilus influenzae (5.1%; 8/158) and S . aureus (4.4%; 7/158), which represent (24.7%; 39/158) of the total confirmed cases. Conclusion Altogether, our findings show a high burden of Cryptococcal meningitis among adults in Mozambique, especially in people living with HIV, followed by pneumococcal meningitis. Our findings suggest that rollout of CrAg Lateral Flow Assay in the health system in Mozambique for early detection of cryptococcus neoformans is necessary to improve overall patient care."
