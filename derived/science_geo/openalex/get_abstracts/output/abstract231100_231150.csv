https://openalex.org/W2109381735,"Streptococcus pneumoniae, the major cause of community-acquired pneumonia and bacterial meningitis, has been shown to transiently invade epithelial and endothelial cells. Innate immune receptors including Toll-like receptors recognize various pathogens, such as S. pneumoniae, by identifying conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Recently, two members of a novel class of pattern recognition receptors, the cytosolic proteins nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (Nod1)/CARD4 and Nod2/CARD15, have been found to detect cell wall peptidoglycans. Here we tested the hypothesis that Nod proteins are involved in the intracellular recognition of pneumococci. Data indicate that pneumococci invade HEK293 cells. Genetic complementation studies in these cells demonstrate that NF-κB activation induced by S. pneumoniae depends on Nod2. Moreover, intracellular transfection of inactivated pneumococci yielded similar effects, confirming the Nod2 dependence of NF-κB activation by pneumococci in HEK293 cells. By dominant negative overexpression and small interfering RNA experiments, we show for the first time that interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase participates in Nod2-dependent NF-κB activation. Additionally, dominant negative interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 2, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6, NF-κB-inducing kinase, transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase-binding protein 2, and transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 also inhibited Nod2-dependent NF-κB activation. We finally demonstrate that in C57BL/6 mouse lung tissue in vivo as well as in the bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B, Nod1 and Nod2 mRNA expressions were up-regulated after pneumococcal infection. Data presented suggest that Nod proteins contribute to innate immune recognition of S. pneumoniae. Furthermore, Rip-2 and members of the Toll-like receptor-signaling cascade are involved in the Nod2-dependent activation of NF-κB induced by pneumococci.

Streptococcus pneumoniae, a human pathogen that frequently colonizes the upper respiratory tract, is the leading bacterial cause of community-acquired pneumonia and meningitis (1Bartlett J.G.

In the United States alone, an estimated 40,000 deaths per year are caused by pneumococcal pneumoniae or meningitis (3Centers for Disease Control and Prevention MMWR Recomm.

The innate immune system recognizes pathogens by sensing so-called pathogen-associated molecular patterns via its pattern recognition receptors. The best studied innate immune receptors are the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which also have been found to be involved in defense against S. pneumoniae (6Koedel U. Angele B. Rupprecht T. Wagner H.

Another subset of pattern recognition receptors are the recently identified nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (Nod) proteins, molecules that have been implicated in intracellular recognition of pathogens (11Girardin S.E.

Nod1 and Nod2 are composed of one or two N-terminal CARDs, a centrally located Nod, and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain (16Bertin J. Nir W.J. Fischer C.M. Tayber O.V. Errada P.R. Grant J.R.

Nod1 is expressed in multiple tissues, whereas Nod2 expression is mainly restricted to leukocytes, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells (17Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S.

After activation of Nod proteins, the Rip2 kinase (also called RICK or CARDIAK) interacts through homophilic CARD-CARD interactions and eventually leads to nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-κB via IκB release by the IκB kinase complex (16Bertin J.

However, there might be intermediate signaling molecules leading to NF-κB activation by Nod proteins that are still unknown. Because pneumococci penetrate epithelial as well as endothelial cells and Nod proteins mediate intracellular detection of bacterial components, we tested the hypothesis that Nod proteins are involved in host recognition of S. pneumoniae. Overexpression experiments indicate that Nod2 recognizes S. pneumoniae. We furthermore show that Nod protein expression is up-regulated in vivo and in vitro by pneumococcal infection. Moreover, this study suggests that in addition to Rip2, the signal-transducing molecules IRAK, IRAK2, TRAF6, NIK, TAB2, and TAK1 are involved in NF-κB activation by Nod proteins in pneumococci-stimulated cells. Bacterial Strains—Capsulated S. pneumoniae serotype 3 (NCTC 7978) were used for the murine pneumonia model. Bacteria were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 on Columbia agar with 5% sheep blood at 37 °C. Single colonies were expanded by resuspension in Todd-Hewitt broth supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract and incubation at 37 °C for 3–4 h to midlogarithmic phase (A600 = 0.2–0.4). Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and were washed twice in sterile PBS. Bacteria were then resuspended in sterile PBS, at ∼2.5 × 108 CFU/ml, as determined by plating serial 10-fold dilutions onto Columbia-agar plates. The S. pneumoniae R6x is the unencapsulated derivate of serotype 2 strain D39 (22Tiraby J.G. Fox M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3541-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A pneumolysin-negative mutant of R6x ply– was generated by insertion-duplication mutagenesis using the pJDC9:ply construct. After transformation of the plasmid into S. pneumoniae strain R6x, erythromycin-resistant transformants were selected with 1 μg/ml erythromycin of Luria-Bertani agar containing 5% sheep blood. Insertion of the plasmid into the pneumolysin-encoding gene ply was confirmed by PCR analysis and DNA sequencing. For cell culture stimulation studies, R6x or R6x ply– pneumococci were expanded as described above, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in suitable cell culture medium or inactivated by heating at 56 °C for 30 min and sonication. The ethanol inactivation was performed as described before (7Malley R. Henneke P. Morse S.C. Cieslewicz M.J. Lipsitch M. Thompson C.M. Kurt-Jones E. Paton J.C. Wessels M.R. Golenbock D.T. Proc. Natl.

HEK293 Cell Invasion Assay and PAF Receptor Overexpression—The cDNA encoding the human PAF receptor (kindly provided by T. Shimizu, Tokyo, Japan) was subcloned into the human expression vector cDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells (ATCC) were cultured in 12-well plates with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. In some experiments, subconfluent cells were transfected with 0.3 μg of PAF receptor plasmid using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Pneumococcal invasion of HEK293 was assessed by antibiotic protection assay as described previously for endothelial and epithelial cells (4Cundell D.R. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Idanpaan-Heikkila I. Tuomanen E.I. Nature. 1995; 377: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 5Ring A. Weiser J.N. Tuomanen E.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 347-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells were infected with 106 CFU/ml S. pneumoniae strain R6x ply–. After the indicated time intervals, cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 h with culture medium supplemented with penicillin G (10 μg/ml) and gentamicin (200 μg/ml) to kill extracellular bacteria. Subsequently, HEK293 cells were washed three times again with PBS and lysed by using ice-cold 0.025% Triton X-100, and 100-μl aliquots were plated on Columbia agar with 5% sheep blood to assess numbers of intracellular pneumococci. In a control, the antibiotics used were sufficient to kill 5 × 107 CFU/ml S. pneumoniae in 1 h. Expression Plasmids, HEK293 Cell Transfection, and Luciferase Assays—Expression plasmids for Nod1 and Nod2 were kindly provided by G. Nuñez (Ann Arbor, MI). Expression vectors encoding wild-type Myc-Rip2 and dominant negative (dn) Rip-2 were a generous gift from P. Dempsey (Los Angeles, CA). The constructs encoding dnMyD88, dnIRAK, dnIRAK2, dnTRAF6, and dnNIK were from C. Kirschning (Munich, Germany) and Tularik Inc. (San Francisco, CA); dnTAK1 and dnTAB2 were a kind gift from Tohru Ishitani (Nagoya, Japan). dnMal and dnTRIF were from K. Fitzgerald (Golenbock Laboratory, University of Massachusetts, Worchester, MA). Subconfluent HEK293 cells were cotransfected the following day using the calcium phosphate method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech) with 0.1 μg of NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter (23Krull M. Klucken A.C. Wuppermann F.N. Fuhrmann O. Magerl C. Seybold J. Hippenstiel S. Hegemann J.H. Jantos C.A. Suttorp N. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4834-4841PubMed Google Scholar), 0.1 μg of RSV β-galactosidase plasmid, 0.1 μg of PAF receptor, and 0.3 ng of Nod or 0.5 μg of Rip2 expression vectors. In some experiments, 0.5 μg/ml MDP (Calbiochem) or 5 × 107 CFU/ml inactivated S. pneumoniae were added to the cells prior to transfection to allow their entry into the cells. When indicated, cells were additionally transfected with 0.1 μg of dominant negative mutants of several signaling molecules. The experiment shown in Fig. 4B was performed using 5, 25, and 125 ng of dnIRAK or dnIRAK2. In some experiments, cells were incubated with S. pneumoniae strain R6x ply– for 5 h on the following day. Luciferase activity was measured by using the Luciferase Reporter-Gene Assay (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), and results were normalized with values obtained by RSV-β-galactosidase or protein concentrations (Fig. 1A).Fig. 1Internalization of HEK293 cells by S. pneumoniae and effects of Nod1 and Nod2 overexpression on NF-κB activation. A, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with a control vector, Nod1 or Nod2 expression plasmids, and plasmids encoding PAF receptor and an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter. The next day, cells were infected with the indicated doses of S. pneumoniae for 5 h. Relative luciferase activities are shown as means of -fold inductions ± S.E. for one representative experiment of three, each transfection performed in triplicate. B, HEK293 cells overexpressing PAF receptor were infected with S. pneumoniae for the indicated time intervals, and an antibiotic protection assay was performed. The number of internalized pneumococci was determined by assessing CFU surviving antibiotic treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) RNA Interference—Control nonsilencing siRNA (sense, UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUtt; antisense, ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGGAGA-Att) and different siRNAs targeting IRAK were purchased from Ambion (Huntingdon, UK). Different siRNAs were checked for their ability to silence IRAK protein expression in HEK293 cells by Western blots using anti-human IRAK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) 72 h after siRNA transfection (RNAiFect; Qiagen). Sequence 3 (sense, GGUUGUCCUUGAGUAAUAAtt; antisense, UUAUUACUCAAGGACAACCtg) was most effective in inhibition of protein expression and was therefore used for further studies. 72 h before cDNA transfections, siRNA duplexes (final concentration 100 nm) were transfected by using RNAiFect (Qiagen). Murine Model of Pneumococcal Pneumonia—Pathogen-free, female C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany). The animals were kept with a 12-h light/dark cycle and were given free access to food and water. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for the care of animal subjects. Mice were challenged at 10 weeks of age and 19–20 g of weight. Mice were lightly anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine and were inoculated intranasally with 20 μl of bacterial suspension (5 × 106 CFU of S. pneumoniae serotype 3). Control mice were challenged with 20 μl of sterile PBS. Groups of three mice were sacrificed 6, 12, 24, or 48 h postinfection, and lungs were removed aseptically and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Control mice were sacrificed 6 h postinfection (n = 3). Frozen lung tissue was crushed using a sterile, nitrogen-cooled high grade steel plate homogenizer. Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Isolation kit (Quiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. For cDNA synthesis, 2 μg of pooled RNA from each group was reversed transcribed using a Pro Stare First Strand RT-PCR kit (Stratagene Europe, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) following the manufacturer's protocol by using oligo(dT) primers. Murine glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as housekeeping gene. After 35 (Nod1) or 40 (Nod2) PCR amplification cycles, samples were resolved on a 1.2% agarose gel. The PCR primers for Nod1 (expected size 469 bp) were 5′-CTTGCATTCAATGGCATCTC-3′ and 5′-ACATCGGTGTGCACTGTGGA-3′; primers for Nod2 (expected size 515 bp) were 5′-AGCAGAACTTCTTGTCCCTGA-3′ and 5′-TCACAACAAGAGTCTGGCGT-3′; and primers for GAPDH (expected size 496 bp) were 5′-TGATGGGTGTGAACCACGAG-3′ and 5′-TCAGTGTAGCCCAAGATGCC-3′. Total RNA from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated murine macrophages (RAW 264.7; murine macrophage cell line) served as positive control. Stimulation of BEAS-2B Cells, mRNA Isolation, and Reverse Transcription-PCR—The human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B (a generous gift of Dr. Curtis Harris, Bethesda, MD) was cultured in keratinocyte medium supplemented according to the manufacturer's instructions (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Cells were grown to confluence in 3.5-cm well plates, subsequently infected with 106 CFU/ml S. pneumoniae strain R6x for different durations, stimulated with 5 × 107 CFU/ml heat-inactivated pneumococci or 20 ng/ml TNF-α (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany). The generated cDNA was amplified by PCR using specific primers (Nod1-sense, 5′-AAGCGAAGAGCTGACCAAAT-3′; Nod1-antisense, 5′-TTCATAGACTTTGGCCTCCTC-3′; Nod2-sense, 5′-AGCCATTGTCAGGAGGCTC-3′; Nod2-antisense, 5′-CGTCTCTGCTCCATCATAGG-3′). All primers were purchased from TIB MOLBIOL (Berlin, Germany). After 35 (Nod1) or 40 (Nod2) amplification cycles, the PCR products were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and subsequently visualized. To confirm equal amounts of RNA in each experiment, all samples were checked for GAPDH mRNA expression. Statistics—Nod2-dependent stimulatory effects of active or inactive S. pneumoniae as well as inhibitory effects of dominant negative signaling molecule mutants were statistically evaluated employing Student's t test. Throughout the figures, p values of <0.05 are indicated by one asterisk, and p values of <0.01 are shown by double asterisks. S. pneumoniae Invade HEK293 Cells and Activate NF-κB in a Nod2-dependent Manner—To explore a possible function of Nod proteins in host recognition of S. pneumoniae, we performed overexpression assays in HEK293 cells. This cell line has been described as not expressing TLR2, a well known receptor for Gram-positive patterns (24Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Merrill Ayres T. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Moreover, we could not detect any Nod2 mRNA and detected only very low levels of Nod1 mRNAs in these cells by RT-PCR analysis (data not shown). We transiently transfected the cells with an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter construct and Nod1 or Nod2, respectively. Additionally, since the PAF receptor has been shown to be involved in internalization of pneumococci (4Cundell D.R. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Idanpaan-Heikkila I. Tuomanen E.I. Nature. 1995; 377: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 5Ring A. Weiser J.N. Tuomanen E.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 347-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), we cotransfected a plasmid encoding the PAF receptor. On the next day, cells were exposed to different concentrations of viable S. pneumoniae strain R6x ply–. We used this pneumolysin-negative mutant for HEK cell experiments in order to avoid pneumolysin-induced damage of HEK293 cells. The bacteria failed to cause induction of reporter gene activity if only a control vector was transfected (Fig. 1A). After overexpressing of Nod1 or Nod2, we observed a constitutive reporter activity, which is in line with previously published results (14Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Viala J. Chamaillard M. Labigne A. Thomas G. Philpott D.J. Sansonetti P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8869-8872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). Pneumococcal infection further enhanced the reporter gene activity in Nod2-transfected cells in a dose-dependent manner, thus indicating a role of Nod2 in NF-κB activation by pneumococci. Nod2-dependent NF-κB activation by pneumococci was less pronounced in cells that were transfected with an empty control vector instead of the PAF receptor plasmid, indicating the importance of cell invasion of pneumococci for Nod signaling (data not shown). Taken together, the data indicate that Nod2 is involved in recognition of internalized S. pneumoniae. To further confirm internalization of pneumococci into HEK293 cells, we performed an antibiotic protection assay as described previously (4Cundell D.R. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Idanpaan-Heikkila I. Tuomanen E.I. Nature. 1995; 377: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 5Ring A. Weiser J.N. Tuomanen E.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 347-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1B, S. pneumoniae strain R6x ply– was internalized into HEK293 cells overexpressing PAF receptor in a time-dependent manner. Nod2 Mediates NF-κB Activation by Inactivated S. pneumoniae—To further characterize the role of Nod proteins in the recognition of pneumococci, we used heat-inactivated, sonicated, or ethanol-inactivated pneumococci; MDP served as a positive control. In contrast to viable bacteria, inactivated pneumococci as well as MDP failed to induce NF-κB activation in Nod-transfected cells when extracellular stimulation was performed (data not shown), an observation compatible with the notion that Nod2 detects only intracellularly located pathogen-derived material. We therefore assessed Nod-dependent NF-κB activity after allowing the internalization of bacterial components into the cells (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). Under these conditions, Nod2 conferred a dose-dependent responsiveness to inactivated pneumococci and MDP (Fig. 2, A and B). Hereby, the ethanol-inactivated pneumococci were more potent then the heat-inactivated pneumococci, displaying Nod2 activity already at a concentration of 5 × 105 CFU/ml. Again, we observed a certain constitutive activity caused by overexpression of Nod1 and Nod2. The different quantities in these background activities may be caused by slightly variable transfection conditions. Involvement of Rip2, but Not of the TLR Adapter Proteins, in the NF-κB Activation by Inactivated S. pneumoniae and MDP—Following our observation that Nod2, and not the TLRs, mediates NF-κB induction by S. pneumoniae in our assay, we tried to further exclude any TLR involvement by using dominant negative mutants of TLR adapter proteins (25O'Neill L.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 270: 47-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Therefore, we cotransfected HEK293 cells with an NF-κB-dependent reporter gene, Nod2, as well as dominant negative mutants of different signaling molecules and stimulated these cells with heat-inactivated pneumococci or MDP. Vectors containing dominant negative mutants of the TLR adapter molecules MyD88, Mal, and TRIF failed to exhibit significant inhibitory effects on Nod2-dependent NF-κB activation (Fig. 3). As expected and shown earlier, dnMyD88, dnMal, and dnTRIF clearly inhibited TLR-dependent NF-κB activity brought about by respective TLR ligands (24Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Merrill Ayres T. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 26Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) (data not shown). In contrast, dominant negative mutants of Rip2, a kinase known to associate with Nod proteins, suppressed Nod2-dependent NF-κB activation induced by inactivated pneumococci and MDP. We thus conclude that Nod proteins and Rip2, but not the TLRs or their adapter molecules, mediate NF-κB activation in our assay. The Signaling Cascade Downstream of Nod2—Little is known about the further downstream signaling cascade of Nod2. In order to identify potential molecules involved, experiments using dominant negative mutants of different signaling molecules were carried out. As shown in Fig. 4A, dnIRAK, dnIRAK2, dnTRAF6, dnNIK, dnTAB2, and dnTAK1 suppressed the Nod2-dependent NF-κB activity induced by pneumococcal components and MDP. Moreover, dominant negative mutants of IRAK and IRAK2 inhibited NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). To further confirm the unexpected role of IRAK in Nod2 signaling, gene silencing experiments using siRNA were performed. To assess gene silencing activities, HEK293 cells were transfected with different siRNAs targeting IRAK as well as nonsilencing siRNA for 24 h, and Western blot analyses using anti-IRAK antibodies were performed 72 h after transfection. Sequence 3 was most effective in gene silencing (Fig. 4C) and was therefore used in subsequent reporter gene assays. As can be seen in Fig. 4D, siRNA targeting IRAK inhibited the NF-κB activation brought about by overexpression of Nod2. In contrast, IRAK siRNA duplexes had no inhibitory effect on TNF-α response. IRAK, IRAK2, TRAF6, NIK, TAB2, and TAK1 Are Located Downstream of Nod2 and Rip2—To examine whether IRAK, IRAK2, NIK, TAB2 and TAK1 lie upstream or downstream of Rip2, plasmids encoding wild-type RIP2, an NF-κB reporter, and the dominant negative mutants of signaling molecules examined were cotransfected in HEK293 cells. Overexpression of Rip2 leads to a strong NF-κB activation (Fig. 5). In line with the above mentioned studies, the reporter gene activation could not be suppressed by dnMyD88, dnMal, and dnTRIF. Furthermore, dnIRAK, dnIRAK2, dnTRAF6, dnNIK, dnTAB2, and dnTAK1 inhibited Rip2-induced NF-κB activation. Thus, IRAK, IRAK2, TRAF6, NIK, TAB2, and TAK1 seem to be located downstream of Rip2 and play essential roles in transducing information from Nod2 to NF-κB activation. Nod1 and Nod2 mRNA Levels Were Up-regulated in Vivo and in Vitro after Pneumococcal Infection—Finally, we analyzed the expression of Nod1 and Nod2 in mouse lung tissue and examined whether their mRNA levels changed during pneumococcal infection in vivo. C57BL/6 mice were infected with capsulated S. pneumoniae serotype 3 for different durations, and subsequently total RNA of mouse lung tissue was isolated and RT-PCR was performed. Our analyses detected Nod1 transcripts in lung tissue, whereas the expression of Nod2 was lower (Fig. 6A). After pneumococcal infection, a marked increase of Nod1 and Nod2 mRNA levels could be observed. To further confirm up-regulation of Nod1 and Nod2 expression during infection with S. pneumoniae, we used the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. Cells were infected with S. pneumoniae strain R6x or stimulated with heat-inactivated pneumococci or TNF-α. The levels of Nod1 and Nod2 transcripts were low in untreated epithelial cells examined (Fig. 6B). Increased Nod1 and Nod2 mRNA levels could be detected after infection. Furthermore, Nod1 and Nod2 mRNA up-regulation was also observed after stimulation with inactivated pneumococci for 24 h and when TNF-α was used as a control (Fig. 6B). Thus, in a mouse pneumococcal pneumonia model and in a bronchial epithelial cell line, Nod1 and Nod2 expression was up-regulated, suggesting a physiological role of Nod proteins in host defense against pneumococci. In the presented study, we show for the first time a role of Nod proteins in host recognition of S. pneumoniae. Overexpression experiments indicate that Nod2 mediates NF-κB activation by viable S. pneumoniae or when inactivated pneumococci were transfected within the cells. Moreover, Rip2, IRAK, IRAK2, TRAF6, NIK, TAB2, and TAK1 seemed to be involved in Nod2-dependent NF-κB activation. We finally demonstrate that Nod1 and Nod2 expression was up-regulated after pneumococcal infection in vivo and in vitro, suggesting a physiological role of Nod proteins in immune response against pneumococci in pulmonary tissue. TLR2 and TLR4 have been associated with host recognition of pneumococci (6Koedel U. Angele B. Rupprecht T. Wagner H. Roggenkamp A. Pfister H.W. Kirschning C.J. J.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas these TLRs are likely to serve as the first line receptors for S. pneumoniae, the Nod proteins might play a major role in a subsequent phase of infection. Since TLRs mediate NF-κB activation and NF-κB binding sites have been identified in the Nod2 promoter (19Gutierrez O. Pipaon C. Inohara N. Fontalba A. Ogura Y. Prosper F. Nunez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L.

Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 1001-1009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), recognition of pneumococci by the TLRs might cause the up-regulation of Nod2 (and probably even Nod1) and thereby facilitate the immune response of the host against this pathogen. In line with this hypothesis, the penetration of epithelial and endothelial cells by S. pneumoniae is initiated during the first hours after infection, and it is most pronounced after 4–6 h (5Ring A. Weiser J.N. Tuomanen E.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 347-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). mRNA levels of Nod1 and Nod2 increased within a similar time frame, suggesting that Nod-mediated NF-κB activation might play an important role in this subsequent phase of host responses against S. pneumoniae. The downstream signaling cascade induced by Nod activation is currently poorly understood. By two different approaches, such as dominant negative overexpression and siRNA experiments, we demonstrated that IRAK participates in Nod2 signaling. Moreover, data presented suggest that molecules like IRAK2, TRAF6, NIK, TAB2, and TAK1 are additionally involved in NF-κB activation and seemed to be located downstream of Nod2 and Rip2. Thus, Nod-mediated signaling might be partly homologous to TLR/MyD88 downstream signaling (25O'Neill L.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 270: 47-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Importantly, the TLR adapter proteins MyD88, Mal, and TRIF did not participate in NF-κB activation by Nod2, indicating that Nod and TLR pathways merge down-stream of MyD88, Mal, and TRIF. In the Rip2 knockout mice, even TLR-dependent signal transduction was attenuated, showing that Rip2 is not exclusively involved in Nod-regulated cell activation (27Chin A.I. Dempsey P.W. Bruhn K. Miller J.F. Xu Y. Cheng G. Nature. 2002; 416: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 28Kobayashi K. Inohara N. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Nunez G. Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2002; 416: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar), and suggesting a model in which Rip2 could be a junction. Nevertheless, analyses using knockout mice and further siRNA experiments should be initiated to clarify differences and homologies of Nod and TLR signaling pathways. The Nod-dependent NF-κB activation by intact or inactive S. pneumoniae is most likely due to cell wall peptidoglycan. Nod2 has been found to mediate cell activation by a muramyl-dipeptide conserved in basically all kinds of peptidoglycans (14Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Viala J. Chamaillard M. Labigne A. Thomas G.

Chem. 2003; 278: 5509-5512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar), whereas meso-diaminopimelate acid is responsible for Nod1 utilization (12Chamaillard M. Hashimoto M. Horie Y. Masumoto J. Su Q. Saab L. Ogura Y. Kawasaki A. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Valvano M.A. Foster S.J. Mak T.W. Nunez G. Inohara N. Nat.

DiStefano P.S. Bertin J. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1584-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). Our finding that pneumococci showed a clear Nod2 but no Nod1 activity is thus in line with the fact that lysine, and not meso-diaminopimelate acid, has been found as the third amino acid in peptidoglycans of various pneumococcal strains (29Severin A. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 168-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high constitutive activity of overexpressed Nod1 and Nod2 might be responsible for the limited effect of viable pneumococci on Nod-dependent NF-κB activation (in contrast to the more distinct effects of intracellularly transfected pneumococci). A recently published paper describes macrophages from Nod2 knockout mice as responding normally to different pathogen-associated molecules, leading these authors to challenge the role of Nod2 in host defenses (30Pauleau A.L. Murray P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7531-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In this study, cells were stimulated with known TLR ligands from the extracellular side, and no viable pathogens were used. It remains to be determined how these Nod2-deficient cells would respond to living invasive bacteria. Thus, the Nod2-deficient mice as well as the recently generated Nod1 knockout mice will be of invaluable help to further elucidate the precise role of these proteins in host defense (12Chamaillard M.

Biol. 2003; 23: 7531-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Overall, besides S. pneumoniae recognition by TLRs, Nod2 activation seems to play an important role in host cell activation by internalized pneumococci. Downstream of Nod2 and Rip2, signal-transducing molecules like IRAK, IRAK2, TRAF6, NIK, TAB2, and TAK1 might mediate NF-κB-dependent cell activation.

https://openalex.org/W2113937251,"Macrophages in advanced atherosclerotic lesions accumulate large amounts of unesterified, or “free,” cholesterol (FC). FC accumulation induces macrophage apoptosis, which likely contributes to plaque destabilization. Apoptosis is triggered by the enrichment of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with FC, resulting in depletion of ER calcium stores, and induction of the unfolded protein response. To explain the mechanism of ER calcium depletion, we hypothesized that FC enrichment of the normally cholesterol-poor ER membrane inhibits the macrophage ER calcium pump, sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase-2b (SERCA2b). FC enrichment of ER membranes to a level similar to that occuring in vivo inhibited both the ATPase activity and calcium sequestration function of SERCA2b. Enrichment of ER with ent-cholesterol or 14:0-18:0 phosphatidylcholine, which possess the membrane-ordering properties of cholesterol, also inhibited SERCA2b. Moreover, at various levels of FC enrichment of ER membranes, there was a very close correlation between increasing membrane lipid order, as monitored by 16-doxyl-phosphatidycholine electron spin resonance, and SERCA2b inhibition. In view of these data, we speculate that SERCA2b, a conformationally active protein with 11 membrane-spanning regions, loses function due to decreased conformational freedom in FC-ordered membranes. This biophysical model may underlie the critical connection between excess cholesterol, unfolded protein response induction, macrophage death, and plaque destabilization in advanced atherosclerosis.

This biophysical model may underlie the critical connection between excess cholesterol, unfolded protein response induction, macrophage death, and plaque destabilization in advanced atherosclerosis. The cholesterol-loaded macrophage, or foam cell, is a hallmark of atherosclerotic lesions (1Ross R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 2Libby P. Clinton S.K. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 355-363Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Cholesterol accumulates in these cells as a result of the internalization of arterial-wall lipoproteins (3Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In early atherosclerosis, most of the lipoprotein-derived cholesterol is esterified to fatty acids by the enzyme acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), which is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (4Chang T.Y. Chang C.C. Lin S. Yu C. Li B.L. Miyazaki A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In late lesions, however, macrophages accumulate mostly unesterified, or “free,” cholesterol (FC) (5Rapp J.H. Connor W.E. Lin D.S. Inahara T. Porter J.M. J.

Although the mechanism of FC accumulation is not known, there is evidence in vivo to suggest that ACAT 1The abbreviations are: ACAT, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase; 16-doxyl-PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl(16-4′,4-dimethyloxazlidin-N-oxy)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DPPC, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FC, free cholesterol; LDL, low density lipoprotein; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; PC, phosphatidylcholine; SERCA, sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase; UPR, unfolded protein response; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations are: ACAT, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase; 16-doxyl-PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl(16-4′,4-dimethyloxazlidin-N-oxy)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DPPC, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FC, free cholesterol; LDL, low density lipoprotein; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; PC, phosphatidylcholine; SERCA, sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase; UPR, unfolded protein response; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. dysfunction, likely coupled with defects in cellular cholesterol efflux, contribute to this process (7Tabas I. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Most importantly, FC accumulation in late lesional macrophages induces apoptosis and secondary necrosis in these cells (7Tabas I. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). These events are thought to contribute to lesional necrosis and to promote plaque disruption, which in turn leads to acute atherothrombotic cardiovascular events (7Tabas I. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 8Mallat Z. Hugel B. Ohan J. Leseche G. Freyssinet J.M. Tedgui A. Circulation. 1999; 99: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Thus, an important goal in this area of research is to understand the mechanisms of cholesterol-induced cytotoxicity in FC-loaded macrophages. In this context, recent work in our laboratory has begun to elucidate the cellular and molecular events involved in FC-induced apoptosis. The key event appears to be induction of the ER stress pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) (9Feng B. Yao P.M. Li Y. Devlin C.M. Zhang D. Harding H.P. Sweeney M. Rong J.X. Kuriakose G. Fisher E.A. Marks A.R. Ron D. Tabas I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). One of the effector molecules of the UPR, a transcription factor called CHOP (GADD153), has been implicated in a number of apoptotic pathways (10Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar, 11Oyadomari S. Koizumi A. Takeda K. Gotoh T. Akira S. Araki E. Mori M. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar), and we have shown that macrophages from Chop-/- mice are resistant to FC-induced apoptosis (9Feng B. Yao P.M. Li Y. Devlin C.M. Zhang D. Harding H.P. Sweeney M. Rong J.X. Kuriakose G. Fisher E.A. Marks A.R. Ron D. Tabas I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Moreover, genetic and pharmacologic manipulations that block FC trafficking to the ER block both CHOP induction and apoptosis. Thus, FC trafficking to the ER somehow induces the UPR, and the CHOP branch of the UPR then leads to the induction of apoptosis pathways in these cells. In the Apoe-/- mouse model of atherosclerosis, FC-rich macrophages in advanced atherosclerotic lesions express CHOP, and inhibition of FC trafficking to the ER blocks lesional macrophage apoptosis and lesional necrosis (9Feng B. Yao P.M. Li Y. Devlin C.M. Zhang D. Harding H.P. Sweeney M. Rong J.X. Kuriakose G. Fisher E.A. Marks A.R. Ron D. Tabas I. Nat.

A. 2003; 100: 10423-10428Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). How might FC trafficking to the ER induce the UPR? We have shown that the earliest detectable event in the FC-UPR-apoptosis pathway is depletion of ER calcium stores (9Feng B. Yao P.M. Li Y. Devlin C.M. Zhang D. Harding H.P. Sweeney M. Rong J.X. Kuriakose G. Fisher E.A. Marks A.R. Ron D. Tabas I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Low calcium in the ER lumen is a known inducer of the UPR, most likely by causing dysfunction of calcium-dependent protein chaperones such as calreticulin, calnexin, and BiP (13Brostrom C.O. Brostrom M.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 79-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 14Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). Proof for this connection in FC-loaded macrophages must await future experiments in which ER calcium pools could somehow be maintained in FC-loaded macrophages. However, pending such proof, we sought to explore how FC loading of the ER might lead to ER calcium depletion. A critical molecule involved in the maintenance of ER calcium stores is sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), which pumps calcium from the cytosol into the ER lumen (15East J.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2000; 17: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The SERCA family is encoded by three distinct genes, numbered 1-3, each of which has multiple isoforms (16Brandl C.J. deLeon S. Martin D.R. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3768-3774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15024-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Burk S.E. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18561-18568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these SERCA isoforms have similar overall structures and function, there are differences in certain specific structural features, functional characteristics, and regulatory properties (19Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most notably, certain isoforms are only expressed in muscle, which contains abundant sarcoplasmic reticulum and high SERCA expression. Specifically, SERCA1a and -1b are expressed exclusively in fast-twitch skeletal muscle, SERCA2a is expressed in cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscle, and SERCA2b, -3a, and -3b are expressed in non-muscle cells (20Wu K.D. Lee W.S. Wey J. Bungard D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C775-C784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now report that FC loading of ER membranes containing SERCA2b, the form found in macrophages, profoundly inhibits SERCA2b ATPase activity and calcium sequestration. Moreover, this inhibition is directly correlated with an increase in order parameter of the ER membrane, which is normally relatively fluid (21Davis P.J. Poznansky M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 118-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although previous studies have investigated similar questions with skeletal muscle SERCA1, the results of those studies have been somewhat variable, and, most importantly, not related to a specific physiological or pathophysiological event in vivo (see “Discussion”). In the current study, the increase in the FC:phospholipid ratio needed to change fluidity and inhibit SERCA2b in the range that occurs in vivo during FC loading of macrophages. These findings support the hypothesis that FC trafficking to the ER, by increasing lipid packing of this normally fluid membrane, inhibits SERCA2b activity. This series of events likely contributes to ER calcium depletion in FC-loaded macrophages and may be a critical event in the induction of the UPR and FC-induced apoptosis.

Rabbit anti-β1-integrin was a gift of Dr. Eugene Marcantanio (Columbia University). Monoclonal anti-LAMP2 (ABL-93) was from the Developmental Hybridoma Bank (National Institutes of Health NICHHD, Iowa City, IA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Cell Culture—RAW 264.7 macrophages were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Transient transfection of HEK293 cells with pcDNA3.1(+)-SERCA2b was achieved using LipofectAMINE® transfection reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol, and the cells were studied 24 h after transfection. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were harvested from female wild-type C57BL6/J (Jackson Laboratories). Mice at 8-10 weeks of age were intraperitoneally injected with 0.5 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 40 μg of concanavalin A, and the macrophages were harvested 3 days later from the peritoneal lavage. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 20% L-cell-conditioned medium for 24-48 h to reach confluence. Macrophages were loaded with FC by incubation with acetyl-LDL (100 μg/ml) and compound 58035 (10 μg/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% FBS. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD)-Sterol Complex Preparation—50 μmol of MβCD was dissolved in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and 6.25 μmol of cholesterol, ent-cholesterol, or other sterol was added to this solution with vigorous vortexing. The dispersion was sonicated for 5 min at room temperature using a Fisher model 60 sonic dismembrator at setting 5. The solution was filtered through a 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and kept in a glass tube under argon at 4 °C for up to a week. To determine the amount of sterol incorporated, the mixture was lipid extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (28Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42389) Google Scholar) and then assayed for sterol content by gas chromatography using β-sitosterol as the standard (29Ishikawa T.T. MacGee J. Morrison J.A. Glueck C.J. J. Lipid Res. 1974; 15: 286-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid Vesicle Preparation—A chloroform solution containing 3 μmol of phospholipid was dried under a nitrogen stream, and the dried lipids were then resuspended in 3 ml of PBS with vigorous vortexing. The dispersion was sonicated at 4 °C under argon using a Branson 450 sonicator with the duty cycle setting at 30% and the output setting at 4, until a clear solution was obtained. The solution was centrifuged for 1 h at 145,000 × g at 4 °C to remove any titanium particles and large multilamellar vesicles. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stored under argon. Preparation of Microsomes—Cells on a 150-mm plate were rinsed twice with PBS and then detached by incubating with 2 ml of PBS, 2 mm EDTA for 5-10 min. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. The pellet was washed with PBS, re-centrifuged, resuspended into 2 ml of low-ionic strength buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 100 units/ml aprotinin), and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cells were then homogenized with 40 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer with the type A pestle. Cell disruption was confirmed by trypan blue staining. The homogenate was made isotonic by the addition of 2 ml of 0.5 m sucrose, 0.3 m KCl, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 40 μm CaCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and then centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a polycarbonate tube containing 0.9 ml of 2.5 m KCl, then centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was washed twice and then resuspended in 200 μl of Buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 0.15 m KCl, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 μm CaCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Protein concentration was measured by the Lowry assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The suspension was then snap frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane Fractionation—A sucrose step gradient was prepared by layering 3.0 ml of 1.1 m sucrose, 2.6 ml of 0.88 m sucrose, and 2.6 ml of 0.58 m sucrose in a 11-ml centrifuge tube, followed by refrigeration for 2 h at 4 °C. Cells from five 150-mm plates were collected and homogenized in 4 ml of low-ionic strength buffer as described above. The homogenates were then made isotonic by the addition of 0.8 ml of low-ionic strength buffer containing 1.46 m sucrose and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (4.8 ml) was divided into two equal portions of 2.4 ml each, loaded onto two sucrose density gradient tubes, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. This procedure resulted in visible bands at each of the four interfaces plus a pellet. Five fractions were collected as depicted in Fig. 1A. The pellet, which was enriched in endoplasmic reticulum (see “Results”), was washed twice and then resuspended in 250 μl of Buffer A. Equal amounts of protein from each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for organelle markers. Lipids from each fraction were extracted using the method of Bligh and Dyer (28Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42389) Google Scholar) and analyzed for free cholesterol content by gas chromatography and for phospholipid content by the Bartlett assay (31Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enrichment of Microsomal/ER Membranes with Sterols or Phospholipid in Vitro—Various amounts of sterols in complex with MβCD, or vesicles containing phospholipids with saturated or unsaturated fatty acids, were added to 100 μg of microsomal or endoplasmic reticulum membranes from HEK293T cells, and the final volume adjusted to 500 μl with Buffer A. After incubation at 25 °C for 30 min with gentle agitation, the samples were centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was washed twice and then resuspended in Buffer A to a final concentration of 1 μg/μl for the assays described below. Measurements of Ca2+-dependent ATPase Activity—SERCA ATPase activity was measured using an enzyme-coupled spectrophotometric assay in which hydrolysis of ATP is coupled to the oxidation of NADH (32Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The depletion of NADH was then detected by a decrease in absorption at 340 nm using a Spectra Max 190 fluorospectrometer (Molecular Devices) maintained at 30 °C. The assay buffer contained 120 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.45 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 25 mm MOPS/KOH, 0.32 mm NADH, 5 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 2 μm of the calcium ionophore A23187. The pH was adjusted to 7.0 with KOH before addition of the enzymes, and the free Ca2+ concentration in the solution was determined to be ∼3 μm. The reaction was started by adding 10 μg of the membranes to 200 μl of the assay buffer in wells of a 96-well UV-visible transparent bottom plate, followed by rapid mixing. The absorption at 340 nm was recorded at 30-s intervals for 30 min using the SOFTmax PRO 3.0 program. Measurements of 45Ca2+ Uptake into Membrane Vesicles—Ca2+ uptake activity was measured using an ATP-mediated oxalate-dependent assay (32Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 45CaCl2 was added to the uptake buffer (120 mm KCl, 25 mm MOPS/KOH, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.45 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm potassium oxalate, 3 mm ATP, pH 7.0) to a final concentration of 1 μCi/ml. The reaction was started by adding 5 μg of membranes to 0.5 ml of Ca2+ uptake buffer in a clean glass tube at 25 °C with gentle mixing. At intervals of 5, 10, and 15 min, 150-μl aliquots were withdrawn from the reaction mixture and diluted into 3 ml of quench buffer (150 mm KCl, 1 mm LaCl3) in a glass tube on ice. The buffer was filtered through a Millipore filtration manifold with a pre-wetted 0.3-μm PHWP nitrocellulose membrane, followed immediately by washing with 5 ml of cold quench buffer. The membrane was removed from the manifold, and radioactivity was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. ESR Spectroscopy and Non-linear Least Squares Fitting of ESR Spectra—5 μl of 0.28 mm 16-doxyl-PC in methanol was added to 250 μl of PBS containing 250 μg of control or FC-enriched ER membranes. The labeled dispersion was vortexed for 30 s, then diluted with PBS to 4 ml and centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was transferred to a quartz capillary tube for ESR measurements. ESR spectra were obtained using a Bruker Instruments (Billerica, MA) EMX ESR spectrometer at a frequency of 9.34 GHz equipped with a Varian temperature controller. The non-linear least squares analyses of the spectra were performed using the latest version of the ESR fitting program (33Budil D.E. Lee S. Saxena S. Freed J.H. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1996; 120 (abstr.): 155-189Crossref Scopus (795) Google Scholar). These analyses yield the following parameters: rotational diffusion rate R⊥ and order parameters S0, S2. R⊥ is the rotational rate of the nitroxide radical around an axis perpendicular to the mean symmetry axis for the rotation. This symmetry axis is also the direction of preferential orientation of the spin-labeled molecule (34Schneider D.J. Freed J.H. Spin Label Theory and Applications. Plenum Press, New York1989Google Scholar). The order parameter S0 is a measure of the angular extent of the rotational diffusion of the nitroxide moiety relative to the membrane director (the normal to the lipid bilayer). The larger the S0, the more restricted is the motion, which usually means that laterally the lipid molecules surrounding the nitroxide radical are packed more tightly. S2 is the non-symmetric order parameter, which represents the nonaxiality of the preferential orientation of the spin-labeled molecule relative to the membrane director. Thus, for S2, the restriction of the wagging motion of the spin label is not symmetric about its main symmetry axis. Cholesterol Accumulation in ER-enriched Membranes from FC-loaded Macrophages—FC trafficking to the ER is a necessary step in ER calcium depletion in FC-loaded macrophages (9Feng B. Yao P.M. Li Y. Devlin C.M. Zhang D. Harding H.P. Sweeney M. Rong J.X. Kuriakose G. Fisher E.A. Marks A.R. Ron D. Tabas I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). As a prelude to our study on the effects of increased ER cholesterol on SERCA activity, we determined the level of cholesterol accumulation in the ER in FC-loaded macrophages. For this purpose, we developed a sucrose density step-gradient fractionation procedure for the isolation of an ER-enriched fraction in RAW and mouse peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B for RAW macrophages and Fig. 1D for mouse peritoneal macrophages, the fifth fraction (pellet) was enriched in the ER-specific protein ribophorin (26Marcantonio E.E. Grebenau R.C. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The blot in Fig. 1B shows no detectable LAMP2 (lysosomes), Gos 28 (Golgi), or β1-integrin (plasma membrane) in fraction 5. As expected for an ER-enriched fraction (35Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13103-13108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the FC:phospholipid ratio of fraction 5 was relatively low (black bars in Fig. 1, C and D). With FC loading of the macrophages, the FC:phospholipid ratio of the ER-enriched fraction increased ∼2-2.5-fold (gray bars in Fig. 1, C and D). SERCA Expression in Control and FC-loaded Macrophages—In theory, ER calcium depletion in FC-loaded macrophages could be caused by activation of calcium release channels and/or inhibition of SERCA. Initial experiments with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor and the ryanodine receptor intracellular calcium release channels reconstituted in planar lipid bilayer membranes with different FC:phospholipid ratios revealed no evidence of consistent cholesterol-induced activation of these channels (data not shown). We therefore focused on the hypothesis that cholesterol inhibits SERCA. In this context, we first determined which isoform(s) of SERCA were expressed in macrophages. As shown by the immunoblot in Fig. 2A (first two lanes), RAW macrophages and mouse peritoneal macrophages express SERCA2b; SERCA1 and -3 could not be detected (not displayed). Previous studies by Caspersen et al. (36Caspersen C. Pedersen P.S. Treiman M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22363-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) showed that SERCA2b expression in PC12 cells was increased by inducers of the UPR. Because FC loading induces the UPR in macrophages (9Feng B. Yao P.M. Li Y. Devlin C.M. Zhang D. Harding H.P. Sweeney M. Rong J.X. Kuriakose G. Fisher E.A. Marks A.R. Ron D. Tabas I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), we assayed SERCA2b protein levels in control and FC-loaded macrophages. As shown in Fig. 2B, FC loading led to an ∼2-fold increase in SERCA2b expression that preceded maximum induction of the UPR effector CHOP. As expected, SERCA2b activity in microsomes isolated from macrophages was too low to be measured in vitro. Because macrophages are very difficult to transfect, we used SERCA2btransfected HEK293 cells as the source of SERCA2b-containing membranes for our study. As shown in Fig. 2A (third lane), endogenous SERCA2b was undetectable in HEK293 cells, whereas 24 h after transient transfection, the cells expressed abundant SERCA2b (fourth lane in Fig. 2A; note that 10 μg of protein was loaded in the fourth lane versus 50 μg for the first three lanes). Immunostaining of the transfected cells showed that SERCA2b was expressed in a distinct ER pattern (not shown). Cholesterol Enrichment Inhibits SERCA2b Activity—To determine the effects of membrane cholesterol enrichment on SERCA2b activity in vitro, we incubated SERCA2b-containing microsomes with various amounts of cholesterol in complex with MβCD. The microsomes were then recovered by centrifugation, and SERCA2b activity was measured. Cholesterol enrichment of the microsomes inhibited both SERCA2b calcium ATPase activity (Fig. 3A) and SERCA2b-mediated 45Ca2+ uptake (Fig. 3B) in the same dose-dependent manner, with a 50% inhibition of both when incubated with 1.5 μg of cholesterol.

Herein we describe that mice lacking the eIF2 kinase, general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) fail to alter the phosphorylation of this initiation factor in liver, and are moribund in response to dietary leucine restriction. Wild-type (GCN2+/+) and two strains of GCN2 null (GCN2–/–) mice were provided a nutritionally complete diet or a diet devoid of leucine or glycine for 1 h or 6 days. In wild-type mice, dietary leucine restriction resulted in loss of body weight and liver mass, yet mice remained healthy. In contrast, a significant proportion of GCN2–/– mice died within 6 days of the leucine-deficient diet. Protein synthesis in wild-type livers was decreased concomitant with increased phosphorylation of eIF2 and decreased phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K1, translation regulators controlled nutritionally by mammalian target of rapamycin. Whereas translation in the liver was decreased independent of GCN2 activity in mice fed a leucine-free diet for 1 h, protein synthesis in GCN2–/– mice at day 6 was enhanced to levels measured in mice fed the complete diet. Interestingly, in addition to a block in eIF2 phosphorylation, phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K1 was not decreased in GCN2–/– mice deprived of leucine for 6 days. This suggests that GCN2 activity can also contribute to nutritional regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. As a result of the absence of these translation inhibitory signals, liver weights were preserved and instead, skeletal muscle mass was reduced in GCN2–/– mice fed a leucine-free diet. This study indicates that loss of GCN2 eIF2 kinase activity shifts the normal maintenance of protein mass away from skeletal muscle to provide substrate for continued hepatic translation.

This study indicates that loss of GCN2 eIF2 kinase activity shifts the normal maintenance of protein mass away from skeletal muscle to provide substrate for continued hepatic translation. Mammals require an adequate supply of dietary essential amino acids (i.e. those that cannot be synthesized de novo) to grow and thrive. Deficiency in one or more essential amino acids in the diet of rodents results in anorexia and loss of body protein (1Beverly J. Gietzen D. Rogers Q. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: R716-R723PubMed Google Scholar, 2Said A. Hegsted D. J. Nutr. 1970; 100: 1363-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Loss of body proteins in growing animals is due in large part to a depression in protein synthesis at the initiation stage of mRNA translation (3Pronczuk A. Rogers Q. Munro H. J. Nutr. 1970; 100: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 4Anthony T. Reiter A. Anthony J. Kimball S. Jefferson L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E430-E439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Translation initiation is an intricate process coordinated by a family of protein factors called eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) 1The abbreviations used are: eIF2, eukaryotic initiation factor 2; GCN2, general control nonderepressible 2; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; S6K1, ribosomal p70 S6 kinase; ANOVA, analysis of variance; 4E-BP1, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1.

Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Under diverse conditions of cell stress, phosphorylation of eIF2α inhibits guanine nucleotide exchange on eIF2 and restrains mRNA translation. At the same time, the phosphorylation of eIF2α serves to enhance gene-specific translation important for regulating the expression of genes that manage cellular insults (7Harding H. Ron D. Diabetes. 2002; 51: S455-S461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Harding H. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol.

A family of four known protein kinases have been described to phosphorylate eIF2α in response to different cell stressors (6Dever T. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 7Harding H. Ron D. Diabetes. 2002; 51: S455-S461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hinnebusch A.

Cell. 2003; 11: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar), this process places eIF2α phosphorylation as the decisive event in regulating the ability of the cell to cope with environmental stress. One of the eIF2α kinases, termed general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2), is activated under conditions of nutrient deprivation or UV irradiation (14Yang R. Wek S. Wek R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2706-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 15Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Deng J. Harding H. Raught B.

The role of GCN2 in response to amino acid starvation has been characterized extensively in yeast (10Hinnebusch A. Sonenberg N. Hershey J. Mathews M. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-244Google Scholar, 17Kimball S. Anthony T. Cavener D. Jefferson L. Winderickx P. Taylor J.

Topics in Current Genetics: Nutrient-induced Responses in Eukaryotic Cells. 7. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2004: 171-199Google Scholar). In yeast, starvation for any single amino acid results in intracellular accumulation of uncharged tRNA, which binds to GCN2 on a domain homologous to histidyl-tRNA synthetases. This binding event triggers a conformational change in GCN2, enhancing phosphorylation of eIF2α. Whereas eIF2α phosphorylation serves to slow global rates of translation, at the same time it enhances translation of the transcriptional activator, GCN4. Increased levels of GCN4 leads to induction of genes that encode amino acid biosynthetic enzymes and other related metabolic proteins in an attempt to correct for the nutritional deficiency. Whereas GCN4 is not present in mammalian systems, several transcription factors have been shown to be induced in response to phosphorylation of eIF2α by amino acid starvation in mammalian cells, including members of the activating transcription factor and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcriptional transactivators (8Harding H.

Another signaling event altered in response to nutrients involves the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein kinase, a downstream effector of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (protein kinase B) signaling pathway. Signaling downstream of mTOR is implicated in many aspects of cell growth including cell cycle control and ribosome biogenesis. mTOR activates both the ribosomal p70 S6 kinase (S6K1) and the mRNA cap-binding protein inhibitory protein, 4E-BP1, and its pharmacological inhibition causes G1 phase cell cycle arrest (19Proud C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20Panwalkar A. Verstovsek S. Giles F. Cancer. 2004; 100: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Recently, there have been reports of potential crosstalk between GCN2 and the TOR signaling pathway in yeast (21Kubota H. Obata T. Ota K. Sasaki T. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20457-20460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 22Cherkasova V. Hinnebusch A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 859-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Specifically, rapamycin releases TOR-directed phosphorylation of yeast GCN2, contributing to enhanced eIF2α kinase activity (21Kubota H. Obata T. Ota K. Sasaki T. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20457-20460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 22Cherkasova V. Hinnebusch A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 859-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Although this finding has not yet been extended to mammals, it suggests that events downstream of mTOR, namely the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K1, may be coordinated with eIF2α phosphorylation via GCN2. Previous work by one of the authors (4Anthony T. Reiter A. Anthony J. Kimball S. Jefferson L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E430-E439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrates that dietary leucine deprivation results in both the increased phosphorylation of eIF2α and the concomitant reduced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K1 in rat liver. The mammalian form of GCN2 was identified several years ago (23Berlanga J. Santoyo J. De Haro C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 24Sood R. Porter A. Olsen D. Cavener D. Wek R. Genetics. 2000; 154: 787-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and soon thereafter a GCN2 knockout mouse was developed and partially described (25Zhang P. McGrath B. Reinert J. Olsen D. Lei L. Gill S. Wek S. Vattem K. Wek R. Kimball S. Jefferson L. Cavener D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6681-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Its phenotype was initially unremarkable, reportedly growing and reproducing normally under freely fed conditions. However, pregnant GCN2–/– dams fed a diet devoid of leucine bore fewer viable pups as compared with pregnant GCN2+/+ dams, suggesting that GCN2 is important for managing nutritional stress during embryogenesis. Currently, there are no studies addressing the role of GCN2 in managing postnatal stress in these mice. Thus, the focus of this investigation was to characterize the growth response of GCN2–/– mice to dietary amino acid restriction, and to determine whether GCN2 is important for coping with nutritional stress postnatally. We were also interested in understanding if GCN2 is the primary kinase involved in catalyzing the phosphorylation of eIF2α in response to amino acid deprivation in vivo, or if other eIF2α kinase family members also serve a role in sensing amino acid deprivation. Finally, we wished to examine whether dysregulation of eIF2α phosphorylation would impact signaling downstream of mTOR. Animals and Diets—The following study protocol was approved by the Institutional Care and Use Committee at the Indiana University School of Medicine, Evansville Center for Medical Education. Mice were obtained by in-house breeding or from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Four to 6-week-old male C57BL/6J (GCN2+/+) and GCN2–/– mice (either on a heterozygous hybrid background of C57BL/6J and TL1 129SvEvTac, as reported in (25Zhang P. McGrath B. Reinert J. Olsen D. Lei L. Gill S. Wek S. Vattem K. Wek R. Kimball S. Jefferson L. Cavener D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6681-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and designated GCN2–/–HH) or backcrossed onto the C57BL/6J background 8 generations (GCN2–/–BC) were maintained on a 12-h light:dark cycle and provided free access to commercial rodent chow (PMI International, Brentwood, MO) and tap water prior to the experiment. At the start of the feeding experiment, mice were acclimated to a nutritionally complete, control diet for a minimum of 3 days, and then randomly assigned to one of four dietary treatments as follows: AA, continued free access to the nutritionally complete, control diet; –LEU, free access to a diet that was devoid of the essential amino acid leucine; –GLY, free access to a diet that was devoid of the non-essential amino acid glycine; PF, restricted access to the AA diet that equaled the intake of mice freely consuming the –LEU diet as previously detailed (4Anthony T. Reiter A. Anthony J. Kimball S. Jefferson L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E430-E439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rodents, when fed a diet deficient in an essential amino acid, will reduce their intake (26Gietzen D. Ross C. Hao S. Sharp J. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Harper A. Benevenga N. Wolhlhuster R. Physiol. Rev. 1970; 50: 428-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Consequently, the PF group was used to compare the effects of amino acid versus calorie deprivation on signaling events regulating protein synthesis. PF mice received their daily food ration as one meal at the beginning of the light cycle. All diets were isocaloric and compositionally the same in terms of carbohydrate and lipid components as described previously (4Anthony T. Reiter A. Anthony J. Kimball S. Jefferson L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E430-E439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The –LEU and –GLY diets were isonitrogenous with the AA diet, with alanine, glutamate, and aspartate compensating for the missing amino acid. Animals in each group were offered their diets at the beginning of the light cycle following an overnight fast and euthanized at 1 h and 6 days (144 h) following commencement of feeding. Food intake and body weight was recorded daily and body and tissue wet weights (liver and skeletal muscle) were recorded at each point of euthanasia. Animals were killed by decapitation and trunk blood was collected for the determination of serum amino acids and insulin concentrations. Serum Measurements—Serum was obtained by centrifugation of clotted blood and then snap-frozen and stored at –20 °C. Serum samples were sent to the Indiana University School of Medicine Quantitative Amino Acid Core Facility (under the direction of Edward Liechty) for the determination of amino acid profiles by the ninhydrin method, using standard ion exchange chromatography with a Beckman 6300 automated amino acid analyzer. Serum insulin was measured using a commercial radioimmunoassay kit (Linco, Inc., St. Louis, MO). Protein Synthesis—Ten minutes before euthanasia, all mice were injected intraperitoneally with a bolus solution of 250 mg of dl-[2H5]phenylalanine per kg of body weight for the measurement of tissue protein synthesis. Each tissue sample was processed to determine the enrichment of labeled phenylalanine in liver protein as previously described (28Caso G. Ford G. Nair K. Garlick P. McNurlan M. PresS. 2002; : 1-44Google Scholar). Tissue l-[2H5]phenylalanine enrichments were measured in Stony Brook by monitoring the ions at m/z 336 and 341 of the tertiary butyldimethylsilyl derivative on a model MD800 GC-MS (Fisons Instruments) operated under electron impact (29McNurlan M. Garlick P. Steigbigel R. DeCristofaro K. Frost R. Lang C. Johnson R. Santasier A. Cabahug C. Fuhrer J. Gelato M. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2125-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The intraperitonal route of injection to ensure constant precursor enrichment has been previously validated (30Lundholm K. Ternell M. Zachrisson H. Moldawer L. Lindstrom L. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1991; 141: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Additionally, time course studies performed using the intraperitonal route of injection demonstrated constant enrichment of the free phenylalanine within the liver and linear incorporation of injected tracer into tissue protein for at least 20 min (data not shown). Tissue Preparation for Immunoblot Analysis—Tissues were homogenized as previously described (4Anthony T. Reiter A. Anthony J. Kimball S. Jefferson L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E430-E439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a Dounce glass homogenizer in 7 volumes of buffer consisting of (in mm) 20 HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 KCl, 0.2 EDTA, 2 EGTA, 1 dithiothretiol, 50 NaF, 50 β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 benzamidine, and 0.5 sodium vanadate. The homogenates were immediately centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C for analysis of the translation initiation factor phosphorylation state as described below. Phosphorylation of eIF2α—Phosphorylation of eIF2α was measured as described (4Anthony T. Reiter A. Anthony J. Kimball S. Jefferson L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E430-E439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using an antibody that recognizes the protein only when it is phosphorylated at serine 51 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA). Results were normalized for total eIF2α with an antibody that recognizes the protein irrespective of phosphorylation state (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1—Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was measured as a change in migration during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as detected by immunoblot analysis as described previously (4Anthony T. Reiter A. Anthony J. Kimball S. Jefferson L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E430-E439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, an aliquot of the 10,000 × g supernatant was boiled for 10 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was added to 1 volume of SDS sample buffer and then subjected to protein immunoblot analysis using a polyclonal 4E-BP1 antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX). Phosphorylation of S6K1—Phosphorylation of S6K1 was measured as a decrease in mobility during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (4Anthony T. Reiter A. Anthony J. Kimball S. Jefferson L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E430-E439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, an aliquot of the 10,000 × g supernatant was added to 1 volume of SDS sample buffer. Immunoblot analysis was then performed using a polyclonal S6K1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnoloogy, Santa Cruz, CA). Statistics—All data were analyzed by the STATISTICA statistical software package for the Macintosh, volume II (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK). Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA to assess main effects, with mouse strain and diet treatment as the independent variables. When a significant overall effect was detected, differences among treatment groups were assessed with Duncan's Multiple Range post-hoc test. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05 for all statistical tests. Data are reported as mean ± S.E. GCN2–/–BCMice Are More Fragile Than GCN2–/–HH or GCN2+/+Mice—A prior characterization of the GCN2 null mouse indicated that these mice grow normally with complete nutrition (25Zhang P. McGrath B. Reinert J. Olsen D. Lei L. Gill S. Wek S. Vattem K. Wek R. Kimball S. Jefferson L. Cavener D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6681-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). GCN2–/– mice used in this earlier study were of a heterozygous hybrid background, a genetic mixture of the C57BL/6J and TL1 129 SvEvTac strains (designated in this study as GCN2–/–HH). It is recognized that the genetic background of engineered mice can influence physiological response to challenge (31Kahn C. Exp. Diabesity Res. 2003; 4: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); therefore, GCN2–/–HH mice were backcrossed into the C57BL/6J lineage for 8 generations (designated in this study as GCN2–/–BC) to produce a mouse that is 99.6% genetically identical to a C57BL/6J mouse (designated in this study as GCN2+/+). Average litter size of the GCN2–/–HH strain was greater than GCN2–/–BC or GCN2+/+ (6.73 ± 0.26 versus 5.65 ± 0.29 versus 5.46 ± 0.45 pups per litter, respectively, p < 0.05). Although similar in initial litter size, GCN2–/–BC mice were decidedly more fragile than GCN2+/+ mice, as a subset of most litters died shortly (1–2 days) after birth. GCN2–/–HH mice could be weaned at day 21, but weaning had to be delayed until day 28 with GCN2–/–BC mice to prevent additional mortality, particularly when housed singly or on wire-bottom cages. By contrast, GCN2+/+ and GCN2–/–HH mice adapted to these environmental conditions upon weaning without incident. Growth curves from birth until 28 days of age demonstrated that GCN2–/–HH mice grew larger than GCN2–/–BC or GCN2+/+ mice (p < 0.05 at days 12–28; Fig. 1). GCN2+/+ and GCN2–/–BC mice grew similarly during the suckling period until day 27 when the body weights of GCN2–/–BC mice began to plateau as compared with GCN2+/+ mice, ending up statistically the smallest in size at day 28. GCN2–/–Mice Consume Less Food, Lose More Body Weight, and Have Increased Mortality When Fed a Leucine-devoid Diet—Intake of a leucine-free diet caused the expected reduction in food intake in all strains (two-way ANOVA p < 0.05 main effect of –LEU on reducing intake) (Fig. 3B). However, GCN2–/–BC mice consumed less food than GCN2+/+ or GCN2–/–HH mice independent of dietary treatment (two-way ANOVA p < 0.05 main effect of GCN2–/–BC strain on food intake). Intake of the leucine-devoid diet in both GCN2–/– strains was less than that in GCN2+/+ mice (–30% in GCN2–/–BCversus –34% in GCN2–/–HHversus –22% in GCN2+/+ compared with respective AA intake). Consumption of the –GLY diet was similar to intake of the AA diet in each respective strain, whereas the PF intake successfully matched the intake of the –LEU mice. Although GCN2–/–HH mice grew better than GCN2+/+ mice, they also lost more body weight on a leucine-devoid diet. GCN2–/–HH mice fed –LEU lost 23% of their starting body weight by day 6, whereas GCN2+/+ mice lost 14.3% (Fig. 3A). GCN2–/–HH mice further became scruffy and lethargic in appearance by day 6 (Fig. 2), yet none died. In contrast, GCN2–/–BC mice fed –LEU experienced a substantial rate of death before the end of the experiment (Table I). Forty percent (8 of 20) of the initial starting number of GCN2–/–BC mice assigned to a leucine-devoid diet would die within 3–5 days. GCN2–/–BC mice that remained viable throughout the 6-day experimental period also appeared sickly and experienced loss of body weight (–19.4%) that was slightly greater than GCN2+/+ mice fed the –LEU diet, and statistically intermediate between the GCN2–/–HH and GCN2+/+ strains. Mice fed a glycine-devoid diet generally gained weight throughout the study period, although GCN2–/–BC mice gained less weight than GCN2+/+ or GCN2–/–HH. This is likely because of reduced intake of the –GLY diet by GCN2–/–BC mice (Fig. 3B). All PF mice lost weight because of reduced caloric intake equal to GCN2+/+ mice fed a leucine-devoid diet. Thus, leucine deficiency in GCN2–/– mice resulted in greater weight loss than that because of caloric restriction alone.Table INumber of wild-type (GCN2+/+), GCN2 null heterozygous hybrids (GCN2-/-HH), and GCN2 null backcrossed (GCN2-/-BC) mice that died or required euthanasia before completion of the 6-day feeding studyMortality rateGCN2+/+GCN2-/-HHGCN2-/-BC+AAaExperimental diets: AA, free access to a nutritionally complete diet; -LEU, free access to a diet that was devoid of the essential amino acid leucine; -GLY, free access to a diet that was devoid of the non-essential amino acid glycine; PF, restricted access to the AA diet that equaled the intake of mice freely consuming the -LEU diet.0/120/122/14-LEU0/120/128/20-GLY0/120/121/12PF0/120/123/12a Experimental diets: AA, free access to a nutritionally complete diet; -LEU, free access to a diet that was devoid of the essential amino acid leucine; -GLY, free access to a diet that was devoid of the non-essential amino acid glycine; PF, restricted access to the AA diet that equaled the intake of mice freely consuming the -LEU diet. Open table in a new tab A small number of GCN2–/–BC mice fed the other diets also died before the end of the study period (Table I). Closer examination of the expired GCN2–/–BC AA, –GLY, and PF mice revealed their starting body weights to be smaller than the average group weights (below 12 versus 15 g average). Therefore, similar to younger GCN2–/–BC mice, their demise may be related to an inability to adapt to being housed singly in a wire-bottom cage, as noted above. GCN2–/–Mice Experience Sparing of Liver Mass during Dietary Leucine Starvation—Leucine deprivation reduced wet weight of liver in all strains. However, when expressed relative to body weight, only GCN2+/+ mice fed on the leucine-devoid diet experienced significant loss of liver relative to body mass (–20% in –LEU, p < 0.05 as compared with AA; Fig. 3C). In contrast, both GCN2–/– strains were resistant to losing a significant percentage of their liver mass. Interestingly, food restriction (PF group) significantly reduced liver mass in both GCN2+/+ (–15%) and GCN2–/–BC (–22%) mice. A glycine-free diet did not alter liver mass in any strain compared with the AA diet. Dietary Leucine Starvation Reduces Skeletal Muscle Mass in GCN2–/–Mice—The wet weights of hind limb muscle (gastrocnemius plus plantaris) were reduced in all mice in response to caloric restriction (PF) or leucine deprivation. However, when expressed as a ratio to body weight, skeletal muscle from GCN2+/+ mice generally remained in proportion to body weight irrespective of dietary treatment (Fig. 3D). By contrast, GCN2–/–HH and GCN2–/–BC mice demonstrated proportionately greater loss of muscle mass by feeding –LEU (–20.5% and –17.5%, respectively, p < 0.05) and GCN2–/–HH strain demonstrated marked loss by PF (–16.5%, p < 0.05). Thus, loss of functional GCN2 resulted in greater loss of skeletal muscle in response to nutrient deprivation. Amino Acid Profiles Suggest GCN2–/–Mice Fed –LEU or PF for 6 Days Are More Catabolic Than GCN2+/+Mice— Serum concentrations of the 20 essential and non-essential amino acids were measured at 1 h and 6 days following consumption of experimental diets (Tables II and III). Data in the two GCN2 null strains were pooled, because values were similar. At 1 h, serum leucine concentrations were lower and serum isoleucine and valine concentrations were higher, in all mice fed –LEU (main effect of leucine-free diet by two-way ANOVA, p < 0.05) (Table I). In all mice fed –GLY, serum concentrations of glycine and serine were lower, irrespective of mouse strain (main effect of glycine-free diet by two-way ANOVA, p < 0.05). There were no changes in the concentrations of any other amino acids.Table IISerum insulin and amino acid concentrations in GCN2+/+ and GCN2-/- mice after consuming experimental diets for 1 hGCN2+/+GCN2-/-AA—LEU—GLYAA—LEU—GLYInsulin (ng/ml)2.14 ± 0.261.71*Main effect of —leucine diet (by two-way ANOVA), p < 0.05. ± 0.131.95 ± 0.182.19 ± 0.331.60*Main effect of —leucine diet (by two-way ANOVA), p < 0.05. ± 0.272.04 ± 0.15Leucine (μmol/liter)224.33 ± 10.3568.82*Main effect of —leucine diet (by two-way ANOVA), p < 0.05. ± 5.86215.20 ± 17.38258.13 ± 38.7351.08*Main effect of —leucine diet (by two-way ANOVA), p < 0.05. ± 4.70249.37 ± 24.58Isoleucine (μmol/liter)150.15 ± 4.75222.76*Main effect of —leucine diet (by two-way ANOVA), p < 0.05. ± 23.47144.04 ± 15.64158.00 ± 30.90237.15*Main effect of —leucine diet (by two-way ANOVA), p < 0.05. ± 15.6415"
https://openalex.org/W2001892266,"CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) is an adaptor molecule involved in T cell receptor signaling and podocyte homeostasis. CD2AP-deficient mice develop nephrotic syndrome and renal failure caused by glomerulosclerosis. Here we report that increased transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) expression and apoptosis were present in podocytes at the onset of albuminuria and were followed by depletion of podocytes associated with progressive focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis in CD2AP-/- mice. Conditionally immortalized podocytes derived from CD2AP-/- mice were more susceptible to TGF-β-induced apoptosis compared with CD2AP+/+ podocytes. Reconstitution of CD2AP rescued CD2AP-/- podocytes from TGF-β-induced apoptosis. CD2AP was required for early activation of anti-apoptotic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 by TGF-β. In contrast, activation of pro-apoptotic p38 MAPK by TGF-β was accelerated and enhanced in the absence of CD2AP. CD2AP was not required for PI3K/AKT activation by insulin and epidermal growth factor, indicating that CD2AP is a selective mediator of anti-apoptotic TGF-β signaling. In summary, we identified CD2AP as a novel mediator for selective activation of survival pathways and repression of apoptosis signaling by TGF-β in podocytes. Together, our in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that TGF-β-induced podocyte apoptosis is an early pathomechanism in mice developing focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis associated with functional impairment of CD2AP.

The TGF-β isoforms are widely expressed and act on virtually every cell type in mammals by engaging a ubiquitous intracellular signaling cascade of Smad family proteins through ligand-induced activation of heteromeric transmembrane TGF-β receptor kinases. Receptor-activated Smad protein complexes accumulate in the nucleus where they participate directly in transcriptional activation of target genes. In addition, TGF-β receptors can activate Smad-independent signaling mechanisms, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and PI3K (1Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar, 2Roberts A.B. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13: 3-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, molecular mechanisms of activation of Smad-independent pathways by TGF-β receptors remain unclear. The mouse CD2 receptor-associated protein (CD2AP) and its human orthologue Cas ligand with multiple SH3 domains (CMS) belong to a family of ubiquitously expressed adaptor molecules that also includes the human Cbl-interacting protein of 85 kDa (CIN85) and its rat and mouse orthologue regulator of ubiquitous kinase (Ruk) and SH3 domain-containing gene expressed in tumorigenic astrocytes (SETA) (for review, see Ref. 3Dikic I. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These proteins are defined as cytoplasmic adaptor or scaffolding proteins by three N-terminal SH3 domains, a proline-rich domain, and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. CIN85/CMS family proteins have been shown to interact with proline-rich regions present in a variety of signaling proteins, including Cbl oncogene, CD2 receptor, AIP1 apoptosis-inducing protein-1, and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), mediated through the SH3 domains, and with focal adhesion kinase p130Cas, Src family kinases Fyn, Src, and Yes, Grb2, and endophilins, mediated through the proline-rich region (for review, see Ref. 3Dikic I. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Other structural features include FXDXF motifs, mediating interactions with endocytic proteins, and actin binding motifs, mediating interactions with actin cytoskeleton. Based on these observations, CIN85/CMS proteins are thought to exert multiple and diverse signaling functions in the organization of the immunological synapse in T cells, endocytosis and signaling of receptor tyrosine kinases, and neuronal apoptosis (3Dikic I. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Degeneration of differentiated glomerular, tubular, and vascular cells in the normal nephron is a hallmark of chronic progressive kidney disease along with readily apparent renal scarring (4Rennke H.G.

Sclerosing glomeruli are characterized by progressive depletion of podocytes, resulting in denuded glomerular basement membrane areas and tuft adhesions, which may be considered as initial lesions of irreversible glomerular injury (4Rennke H.G.

Indeed, recent studies demonstrate that podocyte numbers are reduced early in glomeruli of diabetic patients with nephropathy (8Meyer T.W. Bennett P.H. Nelson R.G.

We have shown that TGF-β1 induces apoptosis in podocytes in vitro and in vivo via a p38 MAPK and caspase-dependent mechanism. We further demonstrated in a TGF-β1 transgenic mouse model of glomerulosclerosis that podocyte apoptosis is an early glomerular phenotype leading to progressive podocyte depletion. Together, our studies suggest that TGF-β may induce podocyte apoptosis and depletion in glomerulosclerosis (10Schiffer M. Bitzer M. Roberts I.S. Kopp J.B. ten Dijke P. Mundel P. Bottinger E.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). An important functional role for CMS/CD2AP in the kidney was suggested initially by phenotype features in CD2AP knockout mice (CD2AP-/-), which manifest high grade albuminuria at a young age followed by progressive glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis and death from renal failure (11Shih N.Y. Li J. Karpitskii V. Nguyen A. Dustin M.L. Kanagawa O. Miner J.H. Shaw A.S. Science. 1999; 286: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). In the present study we describe a novel and essential role for CD2AP in TGF-β signaling in podocytes. We demonstrate that CD2AP is required for rapid activation of PI3K and ERK MAPK pathways by TGF-β. Failure of TGF-β receptors to engage these anti-apoptotic pathways early in the absence of CD2AP is associated with hyperactivation of proapoptotic p38 MAPK and accelerated apoptosis in podocytes in vitro. Finally, rates of apoptosis and expression of TGF-β1 were greatly increased, specifically in podocytes in the kidneys of CD2AP-/- mice, coincident with the onset of albuminuria, and this preceded podocyte depletion and glomerulosclerosis. Mice—CD2AP knockout mice in mixed C57Bl6/129J background were described previously (11Shih N.Y. Li J. Karpitskii V. Nguyen A. Dustin M.L. Kanagawa O. Miner J.H. Shaw A.S. Science. 1999; 286: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Kidney tissue was harvested and either immersion-fixed in formaldehyde for paraffin embedding or embedded in O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) for frozen sections. Animal protocols and procedures were reviewed for ethical and humane standards and approved by an institutional Animal Use Committee. Cell Culture—Conditionally immortalized podocytes were derived from CD2AP-/- mice and CD2AP+/+ littermates and cultured as previously reported (12Mundel P. Kriz W. Exp. Nephrol. 1996; 4: 263-266PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, podocytes were grown on collagen type I (BD Biosciences) at 33 °C with interferon-γ (10 units/ml; Invitrogen) to drive expression of thermosensitive SV40 large T antigen. To induce differentiation, podocytes were maintained at 37 °C without interferon-γ for 14 days. Cytokine and Inhibitor Treatment—Proliferating CD2AP+/+ and CD2AP-/- podocytes were expanded to 70% confluence and serum-deprived by culturing in 0.2% fetal bovine serum for 24 h before stimulation with 5 ng/ml recombinant human TGF-β1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in the absence or presence of 10 μm AKT inhibitor SH-5 (d-3-deoxy-2-O-methyl-myo-inositol 1-[(R)-2-methoxy-3-(octadecyloxy)propyl hydrogen phosphate]) (13Kozikowski A.P. Sun H. Brognard J. Dennis P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1144-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA), wortmannin (100 nm) (Calbiochem), or epidermal growth factor (EGF) (20 ng/ml) and insulin (25 ng/ml) (Sigma). Immunostaining in Situ and in Vitro—For in situ detection of proteins we used the following antibodies: monoclonal anti-synaptopodin antibody (14Mundel P. Anat. Anz. 1998; 180: 391-392Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), rabbit polyclonal anti-WT-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, St. Cruz, CA), and anti-active TGF-β1 antibody (LC 1-30-1) (a gift from Anita Roberts, National Cancer Institute). The samples were evaluated on a Bio-Rad MR600 confocal microscope, and images were captured using a Kanton Electronic Prog/Res/3012 digital video camera and digitally processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.0.2 (Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA). Scoring of Apoptotic Nuclei in Situ—To detect DNA fragmentation in situ, apoptotic nuclei were detected by a terminal dUTP nick-end labeling assay of kidney sections using peroxidase and counterstaining with hematoxylin and periodic acid-Schiff stain, as described earlier (10Schiffer M. Bitzer M. Roberts I.S. Kopp J.B. ten Dijke P. Mundel P. Bottinger E.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The terminal dUTP nick-end labeling assay was used according to the manufacturer's protocol (Intergen Co., Purchase, NY). Positive cells were counted as podocytes when residing on the outer aspect of periodic acid-Schiff-positive basement membrane. Cells residing in areas circumscribed by periodic acid-Schiff-positive basement membrane were counted as endocapillary/mesangial cells. Cells lining the inner surface of the Bowman's capsule were counted as parietal epithelial cells. Quantification of Apoptotic Nuclei in Vitro—Podocytes were seeded on glass coverslips and cultured at 33 °C. After 24 h of serum starvation in 0.2% fetal bovine serum, cells were pretreated with chemical inhibitors as indicated and treated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF-β for 24 or 48 h as indicated before fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma), and coverslips were mounted on slides. Apoptotic nuclei were counted in 20 fields per sample by a person blinded to the experimental conditions. Numbers were normalized for the total cell number per high power field. For reconstitution of CD2AP, cells were cotransfected with pcDNA3.1-myc-CD2AP or empty control vector pcDNA3.1 together with pEGFP (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA) in a ratio of 5:1 using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Transfection efficiency was verified after 24 h by examination of enhanced GFP expression. Cells were serum-starved for 12 h before stimulation with or without TGF-β1 as indicated. Cell Death Δ405 Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Apoptotic cell death was also quantified in vitro using the Cell Death Δ405 ELISA (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, 104 cells were lysed in the provided lysis buffer, and lysates were placed in streptavidin-coated microtiter plates. Anti-histone biotin and anti-DNA peroxidase-labeled antibodies were added. The anti-histone antibody binds to the histone components of the nucleosomes and captures the immunocomplex to streptavidin via its biotinylation. The anti-DNA peroxidase reacts with the DNA components of the nucleosomes. After incubation and washing, color was developed using the provided 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) substrate solution to the wells. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Western Blotting—To detect levels of total protein and phosphorylated proteins, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors as previously described (15Schiffer M. Schiffer L.E. Gupta A. Shaw A.S. Roberts I.S. Mundel P. Bottinger E.P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 2657-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Lysates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE before transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Western blotting was performed as previously described, and the following primary antibodies were used for antigen detection: mouse monoclonal anti-total AKT1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti-S(P)475 AKT, rabbit anti-phospho-Smad2, mouse anti-phospho-Erk1/2, rabbit anti-total ERK1/2, rabbit anti-phospho-p38, and mouse anti-total p38 (all from Cell Signaling Inc., Beverly, MA). Quantitative Real-time PCR—Glomerular fractions were prepared by a sieving method to >95% purity from fresh mouse kidneys. Total RNA was prepared from glomerular fractions using RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and reverse-transcribed with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and the cDNA was amplified using SYBR-Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and specific primers for murine TGF-β1 (5′ primer, CCCTATATTTGGAGCCTGGA; 3′ primer, GTTGGTTGTAGAGGGCAAGG), TGF-β-RI (5′ primer, TCCAAACAGATGGCAGAGC; 3′ primer, TCCATTGGCATACCAGCAT), TGF-β-RII (5′ primer, CAGTGTGCTGAGAGACCGAG; 3′ primer, AGCACTCGGTCAAAGTCTCA), murine WT-1 (5′ primer, ATCTGAAGACCCACACCAGG; 3′ primer, GCTGAAGGGCTTTTCACTTG), and murine Smad7 (5′ primer, ATCTTCATCAAGTCCGCCAC; 3′ primer, AACCAGGGAACACTTTGTGC) in an iCycler (Bio-Rad). Normalization across samples was performed using the average of the constitutive gene murine β-actin (5′ primer, ACCGTGAAAAGATGACCCAG; 3′ primer, AGCCTGGATGGCTACGTACA). Increased Expression of TGF-β1 in Podocytes in CD2AP-/- Mice Is Associated with Onset of Albuminuria and FSGS—We previously reported that Smad7 and TGF-β1 induce apoptosis in podocytes in vitro and in vivo (10Schiffer M. Bitzer M. Roberts I.S. Kopp J.B. ten Dijke P. Mundel P. Bottinger E.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). To determine whether manifestations of FSGS typically observed in CD2AP-/- mice were associated with TGF-β expression profiles in glomeruli, we examined functional and histopathological manifestations of FSGS in CD2AP-/- and CD2AP+/+ littermates at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks of age. Immunoperoxidase labeling of kidney sections from 2-, 3-, and 4-week-old mice for TGF-β1 protein demonstrated that podocytes in 3-week-old (n = 5) (Fig. 1d) and 4-week-old CD2AP-/- mice (n = 5) (Fig. 1f) stained strongly positive for TGF-β1, whereas 3- and 4-week-old CD2AP+/+ controls (Fig. 1, c and e) and 2-week-old mice of either genotype showed no or minimal TGF-β1 staining in podocytes (Fig. 1, a and b). The strong increase in TGF-β1 protein synthesis in podocytes in this model is similar to the increase in Smad7 protein in podocytes that we observed previously in CD2AP-/- mice (15Schiffer M. Schiffer L.E. Gupta A. Shaw A.S. Roberts I.S. Mundel P. Bottinger E.P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 2657-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). During the first 2 weeks, kidney structure and function were not significantly different in CD2AP-/- and control littermates, respectively. However all CD2AP-/- animals had developed high grade albuminuria when examined at 3 weeks of age; significant glomerular histopathology characterized by mesangial proliferation and early FSGS lesions was detectable at 3 weeks and progressed to sclerosis in more than 50% of examined glomeruli in CD2AP-/- mice at 4 weeks (data not shown). Thus, the onset of glomerular disease in this model with high grade proteinuria is rapid and occurs between 2 and 3 weeks of age. Next, we isolated glomeruli from CD2AP+/+ and CD2AP-/- kidneys at 4 weeks of age to quantitate mRNA expression of key components of TGF-β signaling directly in primary glomerular fractions by quantitative real-time PCR. Transcript levels for TGF-β1, type II TGF-β receptor (TGF-βRII), and Smad7 were all significantly increased in glomeruli obtained from CD2AP-/- compared with glomeruli from CD2AP+/+ mouse kidneys (Fig. 1g). In contrast, type I TGF-β receptor mRNA was not significantly different (Fig. 1g). Together, these in situ protein and mRNA expression data indicate that increased expression of TGF-β1 and Smad7 by differentiated podocytes in CD2AP-/- mice is associated with albuminuria and mesangial activation at early stages of glomerulosclerosis. CD2AP Deficiency Predisposes Podocytes to Undergo Apoptosis Induced by Autocrine and Paracrine TGF-β in Vitro—After we determined that increased expression of mediators of TGF-β signaling in podocytes of CD2AP-/- mice coincided with onset of albuminuria, we wished to examine whether TGF-β signaling and apoptosis were affected by CD2AP deficiency in vitro. Conditionally immortalized CD2AP-/- and control CD2AP+/+ podocyte cell lines were established from littermate mice as described previously (12Mundel P. Kriz W. Exp. Nephrol. 1996; 4: 263-266PubMed Google Scholar). After 14 days of culture in non-permissive conditions, morphology and expression patterns of podocyte markers such as WT-1, synaptopodin, and podocin was indistinguishable in CD2AP-/- and control CD2AP+/+ podocyte cell lines (data not shown). In addition, distribution patterns of ZO-1 protein indicated the formation of characteristically interdigitated cell extensions in cultured CD2AP-/- and CD2AP+/+ podocytes (data not shown). Three independent cell clones for each genotype were examined. Quantitation of apoptotic nuclei showed that base-line (un-treated) rates of apoptosis were significantly higher in CD2AP-/- compared with CD2AP+/+ (2.4 ± 0.9 versus 0.7 ± 0.3%, respectively) (Fig. 2a). TGF-β treatment for 24 h increased apoptosis rates by 2.5 ± 0.5-fold over base line in CD2AP+/+ cells and 4.8 ± 1.7-fold over base line in CD2AP-/- podocytes (Fig. 2a). Thus, the apoptosis-inducing effect of TGF-β was significantly enhanced in CD2AP-/- compared with CD2AP+/+ podocytes (4.8 ± 1.7 versus 2.5 ± 0.5-fold induction; p < 0.03). These findings suggest that CD2AP exerted an anti-apoptotic function in podocytes both at base line and in particular when exposed to exogenous (paracrine) TGF-β1. Because we have found that podocytes also secrete latent and active autocrine TGF-β2, 2D. Wu and E. P. Böttinger, unpublished observations. we examined base-line apoptosis rates in the absence or presence of pan-neutralizing anti-TGF-β antibody 2G7. Neutralizing antibody (2G7) significantly reduced base-line apoptosis in CD2AP-/- podocytes by 49% compared with control IgG (1.09 ± 0.39 versus 2.13 ± 0.22%, p < 0.004) (Fig. 2b). Thus, increased base-line apoptosis observed in CD2AP-/- podocytes is largely, but not exclusively, dependent on autocrine TGF-β signaling, indicating that TGF-β receptor activity and survival pathway signaling are coupled in podocytes by the CD2AP adaptor molecule. We conclude that CD2AP deficiency predisposes podocytes to apoptosis induced by both exogenous (paracrine) and autocrine TGF-β. CD2AP Is Required for Rapid Activation of PI3K and ERK1/2 by TGF-β but Not by EGF and Insulin—We reasoned that the anti-apoptotic effect of CD2AP on TGF-β-induced apoptosis could be due to essential survival signaling and/or inhibition of pro-apoptotic pathways or both. Because PI3K/AKT functions as a primary cell survival pathway in many cell types (16Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar), we examined activation profiles of PI3K/AKT in response to TGF-β1 in three independent lines of CD2AP-/- and CD2AP+/+ podocytes, respectively. In CD2AP+/+ podocyte lines, TGF-β1 induced a strong and rapid (minutes) phosphorylation of AKT on serine 473 (Fig. 3a). Serine 473 phosphorylation peaked between 1 and 2 h and remained elevated for up to 4 h (Fig. 3b). In contrast, S(P)473-AKT was not detectable until 1 h of TGF-β treatment in CD2AP-/- podocyte lines (Fig. 3a), and peak phosphorylation was delayed at 4 h of TGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 3b). Among MAPKs, the ERK1/2 mediates primarily mitogenic and/or anti-apoptotic signaling (17Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar, 18Cross T.G. Scheel-Toellner D. Henriquez N.V. Deacon E. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the profile of ERK1/2 activation in control CD2AP+/+ podocytes treated with TGF-β1 was very similar to the S(P)473-AKT profile, including a strong and rapid activation detectable at 5 min (Fig. 3a) followed by peak phosphorylation at 2 h (Fig. 3b). Similar to S(P)473-AKT, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was not detectable during the initial 45 min (Fig. 3a), and peak phosphorylation was delayed between 2 and 4 h in CD2AP-/- podocytes (Fig. 3b). Thus, the anti-apoptotic mediators PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 are activated by TGF-β in podocytes with similar kinetic profiles, consistent with previous reports that ERK1/2 and PI3K are synergistically activated to mediate anti-apoptotic pathways (19Davies C.C. Mason J. Wakelam M.J. Young L.S. Eliopoulos A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1010-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Xu D. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39349-39355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our results presented here demonstrate for the first time that early activation of PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 MAPK by TGF-β in podocytes requires the CD2AP adaptor protein. To examine whether CD2AP and PI3K function in a linear pathway, we quantitated and directly compared the extent of TGF-β-stimulated apoptosis as assayed by DAPI count and cell death ELISA (Δ405) in CD2AP-/- podocytes and CD2AP+/+ podocytes pretreated with wortmannin, a chemical inhibitor of PI3K function. Pretreatment with wortmannin resulted in a significant increase of the proapoptotic TGF-β effect in CD2AP+/+ podocytes, but not in CD2AP-/- podocytes, as determined by DAPI (Fig. 4a) and cell death assay (Fig. 4b). Similar results were obtained when the AKT-specific inhibitor SH-5 was used in place of wortmannin (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that both CD2AP-deficiency or functional inactivation of PI3K were associated with enhanced TGF-β-induced apoptosis signaling in a non-additive, quantitatively comparable manner, indicating that CD2AP and PI3K function in a linear pathway downstream of TGF-β receptors. To confirm this hypothesis at a molecular level by direct reconstitution experiment, we transfected CD2AP-/- podocytes with CD2AP expression plasmid. Expression of epitope-tagged, reconstituted CD2AP in transfected CD2AP-/- cells was validated by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Rates of apoptotic nuclei were significantly reduced in CD2AP-/- cells transfected with CD2AP expression plasmid compared with empty vector (control)-transfected cells (Fig. 4c). Together these findings demonstrate that PI3K/AKT mediate survival signals in podocytes exposed to TGF-β1 and show that CD2AP is required for activation of this survival pathway by TGF-β. To examine whether CD2AP is a general or pathway-selective mediator of PI3K/AKT activation in podocytes, we treated CD2AP-/- and control CD2AP+/+ podocytes with insulin and EGF, two well characterized extracellular stimulators of PI3K/AKT-dependent anti-apoptotic signaling (21Bevan P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1429-1430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Danielsen A.J. Maihle N.J. Growth Factors. 2002; 20: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast with TGF-β stimulation, insulin and EGF induced early AKT phosphorylation rapidly and to a similar extent in both CD2AP+/+ and CD2AP-/- podocytes, respectively (Fig. 4d), suggesting that CD2AP is required for activation of PI3K/AKT pathway by TGF-β signaling through receptor serine/threonine kinases but not by insulin or EGF signaling through receptor tyrosine kinases. We reasoned next that if CD2AP is not required for PI3K/AKT pathway activation by insulin and EGF, then pretreatment with insulin should reduce the increased apoptotic response induced by TGF-β irrespective of the absence or presence of CD2AP. Indeed, pretreatment with insulin significantly inhibited TGF-β-induced apoptosis in both control CD2AP+/+ and CD2AP-/- cells, providing further functional evidence that CD2AP is selectively required for PI3K/AKT-associated anti-apoptotic signaling by TGF-β but not by insulin (Fig. 4e). CD2AP Deficiency Is Associated with Hyperactivation of Proapoptotic p38 MAPK by TGF-β—We have previously shown that TGF-β activates p38 MAPK in podocytes and that p38 is required for TGF-β-induced podocyte apoptosis (10Schiffer M. Bitzer M. Roberts I.S. Kopp J.B. ten Dijke P. Mundel P. Bottinger E.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Base-line levels of phospho-p38 were increased in CD2AP-/- compared with control CD2AP+/+ podocytes (Fig. 5a). TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of p38 was detectable at 30 min in control CD2AP+/+ cells (Fig. 5a) and peaked at 2 h (Fig. 5b). In CD2AP-/- podocytes, TGF-β-induced phospho-p38 activation peaked earlier (1 h) and was further increased at 4 h when compared with CD2AP+/+ (Fig. 5b). The absence or presence of CD2AP had no effect on Smad2 phosphorylation by TGF-β receptors (Fig. 5, a and b), indicating that direct CD2AP-dependent signaling has no effect on Smad activation. Indeed, phospho-Smad2 profiles were comparable for up to 4 h in CD2AP+/+ and CD2AP-/- podocytes (Fig. 5b). Taken together, the kinetic profiles of PI3K/AKT and MAPK activation by TGF-β in podocytes suggest that ligand-activated TGF-β receptors control anti-apoptotic PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 activation possibly through common upstream mediators, which include CD2AP as a novel essential signaling component between TGF-β receptor and PI3K. Moreover, TGF-β receptors control pro-apoptotic p38 activation through a pathway that is distinct from PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2. CD2AP-dependent signals negatively trans-modulate pro-apoptotic MAPKs. Thus, the net effect of loss of CD2AP function in TGF-β signaling is enhanced proapoptotic p38 signaling activity and diminished anti-apoptotic PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 pathway activity, consistent with our finding of increased sensitivity to TGF-β1-induced apoptosis in CD2AP-/- podocytes. Podocyte Apoptosis Is an Initial Manifestation in Albuminuric CD2AP-/- Mice Developing Podocyte Depletion and Glomerulosclerosis—Because CD2AP deficiency in podocytes in vitro caused increased susceptibility to TGF-β-induced apoptosis, we examined whether apoptosis was increased in glomerular cells in CD2AP-/- mice in vivo. Glomerular cell turnover was examined by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling immunoperoxidase staining in combination with periodic acid-Schiff staining to demarcate glomerular basement membrane. We observed significantly increased apoptosis in 3-week-old CD2AP-/- mice compared with age-matc"
https://openalex.org/W1997019726,"Many tumor cells exhibit aberrant gap junctional intercellular communication, which can be restored by transfection with connexin genes. We have previously discovered that overexpression of connexin43 (Cx43) in C6 glioma cells not only reduces proliferation but also leads to production of soluble growth-inhibitory factors. We identified that several members of the CCN (Cyr61/connective tissue growth factor/nephroblastoma-overexpressed) family are up-regulated following Cx43 expression, including CCN3 (NOV). We now report evidence for an association between CCN3 and Cx43. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the 48-kDa full-length CCN3 protein was present in the lysate and conditioned medium of growth-suppressed C6-Cx43 cells, as well as primary astrocytes, but not in C6 parental and human glioma cells. Immunocytochemical examination of CCN3 revealed diffuse localization in parental C6 cells, whereas transfection of C6 cells with Cx43 (C6-Cx43) or with a modified Cx43 tagged to green fluorescent protein on its C terminus (Cx43-GFP) resulted in punctate staining, suggesting that CCN3 co-localizes with Cx43 in plaques at the plasma membrane. In cells expressing a C-terminal truncation of Cx43 (Cx43Delta244-382), this co-localization was lost. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay and co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that CCN3 was able to physically interact with Cx43. In contrast, CCN3 was not found to associate with Cx43Delta244-382. Similar experiments revealed that CCN3 did not co-localize or associate with other connexins, including Cx40 or Cx32. Taken together, these data support an interaction of CCN3 with the C terminus of Cx43, which could play an important role in mediating growth control induced by specific gap junction proteins."

Leptin is secreted into the bloodstream by adipocytes, and blood concentrations of leptin correlate with white adipose tissue mass. Through activation of its receptor in the hypothalamus, leptin can modulate energy expenditure and food intake. Besides this adipostatic function, leptin can also induce proliferation, differentiation, and functional activation of hemopoietic cells (2Gainsford T. Willson T.A. Metcalf D. Handman E. McFarlane C.

Leptin also plays a role in atherosclerosis, because leptin promotes many processes of atherogenesis, and ob/ob mice appear to be resistant to diet-induced atherosclerosis (15Peelman F. Waelput W.

Experientia. 1977; 33: 995-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mature human leptin is secreted as a 146-amino acid protein, with a bundle of 4 helices (helices A-D) with an up-up-down-down topology (18Zhang F.M. Basinski M.B. Beals J.M. Briggs S.L. Churgay L.M. Clawson D.K. DiMarchi R.D. Furman T.C. Hale J.E. Hsiung H.M. Schoner B.E. Smith D.P. Zhang X.Y. Wery J.P. Schevitz R.W. Nature. 1997; 387: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Dali (19Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar) structural similarity searches reveal that leptin shows the highest structural similarity with the cytokines of the IL-6 family and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and to a minor extent with other long-chain cytokines, including growth hormone and placental lactogen (20Zabeau L. Lavens D. Peelman F. Eyckerman S. Vandekerckhove J. Tavernier J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Similarly, the LR shows highest sequence similarity with the receptors of the IL-6 family and with the G-CSFR. The extracellular part of the human LR contains at least seven structural domains (21Fong T.M. Huang R.R.C. Tota M.R. Mao C. Smith T. Varnerin J. Karpitskiy V.V. Krause J.E. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Domains 1 (residue 62-178) and 2 (residue 235-328) have a fibronectin type III fold and together form a cytokine receptor homology module (CRH), named CRH1. Domain 3 (residue 329-427) has an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like fold. Domains 4 (residue 428-535) and 5 (residue 536-635) also have a fibronectin type III fold and together form a second CRH, named CRH2. Domains 6 and 7 adopt a fibronectin type III fold. The presence of an Ig-like domain between two cytokine receptor modules is again similar to the G-CSF and IL-6 family receptors. CRH2 is most likely the main high affinity binding site for leptin on the LR (21Fong T.M. Huang R.R.C. Tota M.R. Mao C. Smith T. Varnerin J. Karpitskiy V.V. Krause J.E. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The Ig-like domain is strictly required for JAK2 phosphorylation and concomitant STAT3-dependent signaling (22Zabeau L. Defeau D. Van der Heyden J. Iserentant H. Vandekerckhove J. Tavernier J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 150-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Human IL-6 forms a hexameric 2:2:2 complex with its gp130 and IL-6Rα chains: each IL-6 molecule binds one IL-6Rα by its binding site I, and two gp130 molecules by site II and III binding sites (Fig. 1) (23Boulanger M.J. Chow D.C. Brevnova E.E. Garcia K.C. Science. 2003; 300: 2101-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Because the leptin/LR system shows significant similarities with the IL-6 family and the G-CSF system, we examined whether similar binding sites I-III are present in leptin. The leptin crystal structure was superposed on the crystal structures of long-chain cytokines, and residues in leptin correlating with binding sites I-III of other cytokines were mutated in mouse leptin. The signaling and binding activity of the different leptin mutants was tested to map the interactions between leptin and its receptor. Interestingly, we identified a leptin mutant in binding site III that lacks any signaling capacity but still binds to the LR with wild type affinity and that thus behaves as a potent leptin antagonist in vitro and in vivo. Structural Superposition and Molecular Modeling of Mouse Leptin—The crystal structures of human leptin and other long-chain four-helix bundle cytokines were superposed using the FSSP and Prosup programs. According to this superposition, their sequences were aligned in moe (Chemical Computing Group). A homology model was built for murine leptin by replacing non-identical residues in the human leptin structure by the optimal rotamer of the corresponding residue in mouse leptin, followed by energy minimization, using moe and the charmm22 force field (24Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar). Mutants were chosen based on molecular modeling: solvent-accessible residues selected for mutagenesis were replaced in silico by different hydrophilic residues, and the effect on the overall structure and potential energy of leptin was tested to check mutant misfolding, instability, and hence potential expression problems. Generation of HA-tagged Mouse Leptin Mutants—The pMET7-SIgKHA-mLep vector allows the expression of a fusion protein, consisting of the SIgK signal peptide, followed by the HA tag sequence, followed by a four-amino acid GGSG linker, followed by amino acids 3-146 of mouse leptin. Upon expression in eukaryotic cells, the SIgK signal peptide is cleaved off and the HA-tagged protein is secreted in the medium. Mutations in the HA-tagged mouse leptin were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis procedure (Stratagene). Mutations were coupled to a change in restriction cleavage and confirmed by restriction analysis and DNA sequence analysis. Expression of HA-tagged Mouse Leptin Mutants—3 × 106 COS-1 cells were seeded in 75-cm2 flasks and cultured overnight in DMEM (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in a 10% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. The cells were then transfected using a standard polyethyleneimine transfection method with the pMet7-SIgK-HA-mLep vector or mutants in this vector. Medium was replaced 4 h post-transfection, and cells were further cultured for 4 h, after which the medium was replaced by 25 ml of Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen). After another 90 h, the Opti-MEM medium containing the secreted HA-tagged leptin or mutant was collected, and cells were removed by centrifugation and filtration through a 0.22-μm filter. The media were concentrated 30-fold with Vivaspin 15R concentrators, with a molecular weight cut-off of 5000 Da (Sartorius). Expression was verified by Western blot analysis, using a mouse monoclonal anti-HA tag antibody (clone 12CA5, Roche Applied Science), and a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences). The concentration of the mouse leptin mutants was determined using a mouse leptin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D systems). rPAP1-luciferase Reporter Assay—HEK293T cells were transfected with the pMET7-mLRlo plasmid and the pXP2d2-rPAP1 plasmid. The pMET7-mLRlo plasmid encodes the long form of the mouse LR with a C-terminal myc tag. The pXP2d2-rPAP1 plasmid contains the luciferase gene under control of the STAT3-inducible rat pancreatitis-associated protein-1 promoter (25Eyckerman S. Broekaert D. Verhee A. Vandekerckhove J. Tavernier J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 26Broekaert D. Eyckerman S. Lavens D. Verhee A. Waelput W. Vandekerckhove J. Tavernier J. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 2002; 13: 78-85PubMed Google Scholar). On day 1, 7 × 106 HEK293T cells were seeded into a 175-cm2 flask. Cells were cultured overnight in DMEM (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in a 10% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. On day 2, the cells were transfected overnight with ∼36 μg of pMET7-mLRlo DNA and 9 μg of pXP2d2-rPAP1 DNA using a standard calcium phosphate precipitation procedure. On day 3, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline-A (Invitrogen) and cultured overnight. On day 4, cells were detached with cell dissociation agent (Invitrogen) and resuspended in medium, and 50 μl of cell suspension was seeded in black 96-well plates (Costar). Cells were stimulated with 50 μl of a dilution of the concentrated COS-1 supernatant, containing the HA-tagged leptin mutant. On day 5, the luciferase activity induced by the mutant was measured by chemiluminescence. Cells were lysed in 50 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.8; 2 mm EDTA; 2 mm dithiothreitol; 10% glycerol; 1% Triton X-100) for 10 min, and 35 μl of luciferase substrate buffer (20 mm Tricine; 1.07 mm (MgCO3)4Mg(OH)2·5H2O; 2.67 mm MgSO4·7H2O; 0.1 mm EDTA; 33.3 mm dithiothreitol; 270 mm Coenzyme A; 470 mm Luciferin; 530 mm ATP; final pH 7.8) was added in each well. Light emission was measured for 5 s in a TopCount chemiluminescence counter (Packard). Competition Assay for CRH2 Binding—We measured binding of the leptin mutants to CRH2 by competition with a mouse leptin-secreted alkaline phosphatase fusion protein (leptin-SEAP, wherein SEAP is fused to the C terminus of leptin) (27Eyckerman S. Waelput W. Verhee A. Broekaert D. Vandekerckhove J. Tavernier J. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1999; 10: 549-556PubMed Google Scholar). pMET7-mLRCRH2-his6 encodes amino acids 407-604, corresponding to the CRH2 module of the murine LR, followed by a C-terminal His6 tag. 2L. Zabeau, D. Defeau, F. Peelman, H. Iserentant, and J. Tavernier, unpublished results. COS-1 cells were transfected with pMET7-mLRCRH2-his6 using the polyethyleneimine transfection method, as described above. Maxisorp plates (Nunc) were coated overnight at 6 °C with 0.25 μg/ml anti-His5 antibody (Qiagen). Plates were washed four times with wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween 20). The free protein binding sites on the plates were blocked by incubation with 1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Sigma-Aldrich), 5% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, at 37 °C for 2 h. Plates were washed four times with wash buffer. The plates were incubated overnight at 6 °C with the undiluted medium containing the His-tagged CRH2 of the murine LR. Plates were washed four times with wash buffer. The plates were then co-incubated with diluted COS-1 medium, containing the leptin mutant and a 1/80 dilution of a COS-1-conditioned medium containing the leptin-SEAP chimera. After four washing steps with wash buffer, endogenous phosphatases were inactivated (65 °C for 30 min), and secreted alkaline phosphatase activity was measured using the CSPD substrate method (PhosphaLight, Tropix) in a TopCount chemiluminescence counter (Packard). Production and Purification of HA-tagged S120A/T121A Mutant Mouse Leptin—COS-1 cells were seeded at 8 × 106 cells per 175-cm2 flask in DMEM. Ten 175-cm2 flasks were transfected with the S120A/T121A pMET7-SIgK-HA-mLep mutant by transfection using polyethyleneimine. After 4 h, the medium was replaced by fresh DMEM, and cells were grown overnight. The medium was then replaced by 50 ml of Opti-MEM, and cells were incubated in this medium for another 72 h. The medium with the secreted S120A/T121A HA-tagged mouse leptin was collected and filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, and complete (Roche Applied Science) protease inhibitor was added. The S120A/T121A HA-tagged mouse leptin was purified onto a 1-ml anti-HA affinity column (Roche Applied Science). The medium was loaded at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The column was washed with 25 ml of equilibration buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA) plus 0.05% Tween 20, followed by 10 ml of equilibration buffer without Tween 20. The S120A/T121A HA-mouse leptin was eluted with HA peptide (1 mg/ml) in equilibration buffer at 37 °C. The presence of the HA-tagged mutant in the eluates was verified by Western blot analysis, using a mouse monoclonal anti-HA tag antibody (clone 12CA5, Roche Applied Science) and a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Production and Purification of Recombinant S120A/T121A Mutant Human Leptin—We introduced the S120A/T121A mutation in the pLPPsOMPAhOB plasmid, using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis as described above. The pLPPsOMPAhOB plasmid harboring the S120A/T121A mutation was electroporated into Escherichia coli MC1061 cells. This allows the expression of untagged, properly folded S120A/T121A human leptin in the periplasm of E. coli MC1061 cells (28Guisez Y. Fache I. Campfield L.A. Smith F.J. Farid A. Plaetinck G. Van der Heyden J. Tavernier J. Fiers W. Burn P. Devos R. Prot. Expr. Purif. 1998; 12: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The periplasmic fraction was prepared by an osmotic shock procedure (28Guisez Y. Fache I. Campfield L.A. Smith F.J. Farid A. Plaetinck G. Van der Heyden J. Tavernier J. Fiers W. Burn P. Devos R. Prot. Expr. Purif. 1998; 12: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) was added. The S120A/T121A human leptin was purified from the periplasmic fraction by affinity chromatography with a column consisting of 2A5 monoclonal anti-human leptin antibody (29Verploegen S.A.B.W. Plaetinck G. Devos R. Van der Heyden J. Guisez Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), coupled to divinylsulfone-activated agarose (Mini-LEAK, Kem-En-Tec). After loading of the periplasmic fraction, the column was washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the bound S120A/T121A human leptin was eluted with 2 m MgCl2. After dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline, residual endotoxins were removed via polymyxin B-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich). The concentration of S120A/T121A human leptin was determined by measuring the optical density at 280 nm. On average, 9 mg of S120A/T121A human leptin was purified from 8 liters of E. coli culture. Competitive Inhibition of LR Signaling—For testing the antagonistic properties of human and mouse S120A/T121A leptin on mouse LR signaling, HEK293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates, co-transfected with the pMET7-mLRlo and the pXP2d2-rPAP1 plasmids, detached, and resuspended as described above. 50 μl of the cell suspension was seeded in each well of a black 96-well plate (Costar). 50 or 100 μl of a mixture of mouse or human leptin with mouse or human S120A/T121A leptin was added, as specified below. Cells were lysed after overnight incubation, and the luciferase activity was measured as described above. For testing the antagonistic properties of the HA-tagged S120A/T121A mouse leptin, Opti-MEM medium, containing wt HA-tagged mouse leptin was diluted 16-fold in Opti-MEM. 50 μl of this diluted medium was added to the cells, together with 50 μl of dilution of anti-HA-purified HA-tagged S120A/T121A mouse leptin. For testing the antagonistic properties of the S120A/T121A human leptin, 50 μl of cell suspension was incubated with 50 μl of a mixture of 9 ng/ml recombinant mouse leptin (R&D Systems) plus different concentrations of purified untagged S120A/T121A human leptin. For testing the antagonistic properties of human S120A/T121A leptin on human LR signaling, HEK293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates, co-transfected with the pSVSPORT-hLRlo and the pXP2d2-rPAP1 plasmids, detached, and resuspended as described above. The pSVSPORT-hLRlo allows expression of the long form of the human leptin receptor. 50 μl of cell suspension was incubated with 50 μl of a mixture of 16 ng/ml recombinant human leptin (R&D Systems) plus different concentrations of purified untagged S120A/T121A human leptin. In Vivo Antagonism of the S120A/T121A Leptin Mutant—DBA/1 mice, 10-12 weeks of age, were purchased from Janvier (Le Genest St. Isle, France). Mice were treated and used in agreement with the institutional guidelines. To analyze the effect of WT leptin and leptin antagonist on body weight, either 40 μg of WT leptin or 40 μg of leptin antagonist were injected intraperitoneally into DBA/1 mice, twice a day. Before injection, both WT leptin and leptin antagonist were preincubated with 200 μg of anti-leptin mAb 2A5 to increase their in vivo stability (29Verploegen S.A.B.W. Plaetinck G. Devos R. Van der Heyden J. Guisez Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Body weight was measured, three times a week, beginning from 1 day before intraperitoneal injections. Identification of Candidate Binding Sites in Leptin Using Structural Superposition—Long-chain four-helical bundle cytokines typically interact with their receptor through two or three binding sites in the cytokine. Human IL-6 forms a hexameric 2:2:2 complex with its gp130 and IL-6Rα chains: each IL-6 molecule binds one IL-6Rα by its binding site I and two gp130 molecules by its binding sites II and III (Fig. 1A) (23Boulanger M.J. Chow D.C. Brevnova E.E. Garcia K.C. Science. 2003; 300: 2101-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Binding site I is formed by the C terminus of helix D and binds to the CRH of the IL-6Rα chain. Binding site II, consisting of residues in helices A and C, interacts with the CRH of gp130. Binding site III consists of residues in the N terminus of helix D, in the loop connecting helices C and D and in the loop connecting helices A and B, and interacts with the immunoglobulin-like domain of gp130. The detailed crystal structure of the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus IL-6 (vIL-6, viral IL-6) in a 2:2 tetrameric complex with the three N-terminal extracellular domains of human gp130 revealed only two binding sites, binding sites II and III, for interaction between vIL-6 and gp130 (30Chow D.C. He X.L. Snow A.L. Rose-John S. Garcia K.C. Science. 2001; 291: 2150-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). G-CSF most probably interacts with its receptor in a similar tetrameric complex: binding site II interacts with the CRH of the G-CSFR, whereas binding site III interacts with the immunoglobulin-like domain of the G-CSFR (Fig. 1B) (31Layton J.E. Hall N.E. Connell F. Venhorst J. Treutlein H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36779-36787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A binding site I is probably not required for G-CSF receptor activation. Site I-III residues were identified in other members of the IL-6 family of cytokines by site-directed mutagenesis: human IL-6, human IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M, and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) (32Kalai M.

Human leptin residues overlapping with or close to these binding sites were considered as possible binding site I, II, or III residues. Within this selection, residues with high solvent accessibility were selected for site-directed mutagenesis. The structural superposition, with identification of the binding sites is shown in Fig. 1E. The alignment corresponding to this superposition is shown in Fig. 1F. Solvent-accessible residues outside the three possible binding sites were also selected for mutagenesis to detect possible binding sites that would not coincide with binding sites I, II, or III in other cytokines. These residues were chosen to cover the entire surface of leptin, so that no surface residue is further than 8 Å from a mutated residue. A total of 31 leptin mutants were created. Table I shows a list of the mutations, with their position in the leptin structure indicated.Table IEffects of leptin mutations on rPAP1-luciferase reporter activity Open table in a new tab Effects of Leptin Mutations on LR Signaling—HA-tagged wild type leptin and mutants were expressed in COS-1 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2164599187,"Three different mammalian sialidases have been described as follows: lysosomal (Neu1, gene NEU1), cytoplasmic (Neu2, gene NEU2), and plasma membrane (Neu3, gene NEU3). Because of mutations in the NEU1 gene, the inherited deficiency of Neu1 in humans causes the severe multisystemic neurodegenerative disorder sialidosis. Galactosialidosis, a clinically similar disorder, is caused by the secondary Neu1 deficiency because of genetic defects in cathepsin A that form a complex with Neu1 and activate it. In this study we describe a novel lysosomal lumen sialidase encoded by the NEU4 gene on human chromosome 2. We demonstrate that Neu4 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and has broad substrate specificity by being active against sialylated oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and gangliosides. In contrast to Neu1, Neu4 is targeted to lysosomes by the mannose 6-phospate receptor and does not require association with other proteins for enzymatic activity. Expression of Neu4 in the cells of sialidosis and galactosialidosis patients results in clearance of storage materials from lysosomes suggesting that Neu4 may be useful for developing new therapies for these conditions.

Three different mammalian sialidases have been described as follows: lysosomal (Neu1, gene NEU1), cytoplasmic (Neu2, gene NEU2), and plasma membrane (Neu3, gene NEU3).

J. 1993; 10: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and is involved in lysosomal catabolism of sialylated glycoconjugates (reviewed in Ref. 2Pshezhetsky A.V. Ashmarina M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 69: 81-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Neu2 is active against α2-3-sialylated oligosaccharides, glycopeptides, and gangliosides (3Miyagi T. Tsuiki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 710-6716Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 4Monti E. Preti A. Nesti C. Ballabio A. Borsani G.

Chem. 2004; 279: 3169-3179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The exact biological role of this enzyme is not known, but it was suggested to cleave GM3 ganglioside, associated with the cytoskeleton, leading to the alteration of cytoskeletal functions (6Akita H. Miyagi T. Hata K. Kagayama M. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 107: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 7Sato K. Miyagi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In accordance with this, the Neu2 activity of melanoma cells inversely correlates with their invasive and metastatic potential (8Tokuyama S. Moriya S. Taniguchi S. Yasui A. Miyazaki J. Orikasa S. Miyagi T. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 73: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Neu3 is an integral membrane protein localized in caveolae microdomains of plasma membranes (9Wada T. Yoshikawa Y. Tokuyama S. Kuwabara M. Akita H. Miyagi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 10Wang Y. Yamaguchi K. Wada T. Hata K. Zhao X. Fujimoto T. Miyagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26252-26259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is active mostly against gangliosides involved in signal transduction including GM1, GD1a, and other polysialogangliosides (11Schneider-Jakob H.R. Cantz M. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1991; 372: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Neu3 is probably involved in the modulation of the oligosaccharide chains of gangliosides on the cell surface in the course of transformation, differentiation, and formation of cell contacts (12Kopitz J. von Reitzenstein C. Sinz K. Cantz M. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Kopitz J. von Reitzenstein C. Burchert M. Cantz M. Gabius H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11205-11211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In particular it is implicated in cell signaling during neuritogenesis (14Wu G. Ledeen R.W. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), carcinogenesis, and apoptosis (15Kakugawa Y. Wada T. Yamaguchi K. Yamanami H. Ouchi K. Sato I. Miyagi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10718-10723Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) as well as in insulin signaling (16Sasaki A. Hata K. Suzuki S. Sawada M. Wada T. Yamaguchi K. Obinata M. Tateno H. Suzuki H. Miyagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27896-27902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The autosomal recessive disorder sialidosis (OMIM 256550) is caused by lysosomal sialidase deficiency because of mutations in the NEU1 gene (reviewed in Refs. 17Thomas G.H. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 3507-3534Google Scholar and 18Seyrantepe V. Poupetova H. Froissart R. Zabot M.-T. Pshezhetsky A.V. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 22: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Another disorder, galactosialidosis (OMIM 256540), is caused by the secondary Neu1 deficiency because of genetic defects in cathepsin A that form a complex with Neu1 and activate it (reviewed in Ref. 19d'Azzo A. Andria G. Strisciuglio P. Galijaard H. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 3811-3826Google Scholar). Both disorders belong to the group of lysosomal storage diseases because sialidase deficiency in both cases disrupts the catabolic pathways for degradation of sialylated glycoconjugates, causing their accumulation in the lysosome and excretion in urine (17Thomas G.H. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 3507-3534Google Scholar, 19d'Azzo A. Andria G. Strisciuglio P. Galijaard H. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 3811-3826Google Scholar). Both sialidosis and galactosialidosis include patients with severe early onset form and relatively mild late onset form. All patients develop visual defects, myoclonus syndrome, cherry-red macular spots, ataxia, hyper-reflexia, and seizures. The severe early onset form is also associated with dysostosis multiplex, Hurler-like phenotype, mental and motor retardation, and hepatosplenomegaly (17Thomas G.H. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 3507-3534Google Scholar, 19d'Azzo A. Andria G. Strisciuglio P. Galijaard H. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 3811-3826Google Scholar). Identification of the human sialidase cDNA and gene on human chromosome 6 (20Bonten E. van der Spoel S.A. Fornerod M. Grosveld G. d'Azzo A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3156-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 21Milner C.M. Smith S.V. Carrillo M.B. Taylor G.L. Hollinshead M. Campbell R.D. J. Biol.

Dallaire L. Potier M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) paved the way for the characterization of the molecular basis of sialidosis, molecular diagnostics of this disease, and genotype-phenotype correlations (reviewed in Ref. 18Seyrantepe V. Poupetova H. Froissart R. Zabot M.-T. Pshezhetsky A.V. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 22: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, development of enzyme replacement or gene replacement therapies for sialidosis has been hampered because Neu1 is an integral membrane enzyme (23Lukong K.E. Seyrantepe V. Landry K. Trudel S. Ahmad A. Gahl W.A. Lefrancois S. Morales C.R. Pshezhetsky A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46172-46181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and requires co-expression with cathepsin A for induction of enzymatic activity (20Bonten E. van der Spoel S.A. Fornerod M. Grosveld G. d'Azzo A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3156-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Here we describe that a novel human sialidase, Neu4 encoded by a NEU4 gene on chromosome 2, exhibits broad substrate specificity and trafficking to the lysosomal lumen. Over-expression of Neu4 clears storage materials from cultured fibroblasts of sialidosis and galactosialidosis patients. Administration of Neu4 and/or induction of NEU4 gene may therefore offer potential for the treatment of the severe multisystemic neurodegenerative disorders caused by defects of the NEU1 gene. Plasmids—The human Neu4 cDNA clone 4156395 was obtained from the ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). For the expression of Neu4-GFP and GFP-Neu4 fusion proteins, an entire cDNA was subcloned into EcoRI-BamHI sites of pEGFP_N3 and pEGFP_C1 vectors (Clontech). For the expression of Neu4-FLAG fusion protein, the Neu4 cDNA was subcloned into EcoRI-XhoI sites of pCMVTag4A vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Neu3 cDNA, kindly provided by Dr. Miyagi from the Research Institute, Miyagi Prefectural Cancer Center (Japan), was subcloned into SacII-XhoI sites of pCMV-Script vector (Stratagene). Expression constructs for human lysosomal sialidase Neu1 (pCMV-Neu1) and human lysosomal cathepsin A (pCMVCathA) were described before (22Pshezhetsky A.V. Richard C. Michaud L. Igdoura S. Wang S. Elsliger M.A. Qu J. Leclerc D. Gravel R. Dallaire L. Potier M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Expression of Neu4 in Human Fibroblasts and in COS-7 Cells—Human skin fibroblasts of sialidosis, galactosialidosis, and mucolipidosis II patients and of normal controls were obtained from NIGMS Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (GM2438A), Montreal Children's Hospital Cell Repository (WG0544), and from Ste-Justine Hospital cell repository (7615). Skin fibroblasts cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics, were trypsinized, suspended at a density of 6 × 106 cells per ml in Eagle's minimal essential medium, and electroporated by using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). COS-7 cells cultured until 70% confluency in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics were transfected by using a LipofectAMINE Plus kit (Invitrogen) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Subcellular Fractionation of COS-7 Cells—Subcellular fractionation was performed as described for rat liver (24Graham Y. Rickwood D. Centrifugation: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1984: 161-182Google Scholar), but a Dounce tissue grinder was used to break the cells instead of a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. Light mitochondrial fraction was further separated using the density gradient ultracentrifugation. The fraction was applied at the bottom of a 0-22% OptiPrep (Invitrogen) gradient. After a 2-h centrifugation at 24,000 rpm in an SW41-Ti Beckman rotor, 12 fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of the tube. Enzyme Assays—Sialidase, β-galactosidase, and β-hexosaminidase activities in cellular homogenates and in subcellular fractions were assayed by using the corresponding fluorogenic 4-methylumbelliferyl glycoside substrates (25Potier M. Mameli L. Belisle M. Dallaire L. Melançon S.B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 26Rome L.H. Garvin A.J. Allietta M.M. Neufeld E.F. Cell. 1979; 17: 143-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase, glutamate dehydrogenase, and esterase in subcellular factions were measured as described elsewhere (27Bergmeyer H. Gawehn K. Grassl M. Bergmeyer H.V. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1974: 495-496Google Scholar, 28Schmidt E. Bergmeyer H.V. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis.

Sialidase activity toward mucin, sialyllactose, and mixed bovine gangliosides was measured as described (1Miyagi T. Hata K. Hasegawa A. Aoyagi T. Glycoconj. J. 1993; 10: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11Schneider-Jakob H.R. Cantz M. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1991; 372: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in the presence of Triton X-100 (0.2%) or sodium deoxycholate (0.1%). The concentration of released sialic acid was measured by the thiobarbituric method (31Manzi A.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2003: 17.18.8-17.18.10Google Scholar). Enzyme activity is expressed as the conversion of 1 nmol of substrate per h. Protein concentration was assayed according to Bradford (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Skin fibroblasts or COS-7 cells were treated for 45 min with 75 nm LysoTracker Red DND-99 dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), washed twice with ice-cold PBS, 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; LC, liquid chromatography; 4-MU-NANA, 2′-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein. and fixed with 3.8% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. Cells were permeabilized by 0.5% Triton X-100, washed twice with PBS, stained with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies, and counterstained with Oregon Green 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Alternatively, the cells were double stained with anti-FLAG antibodies and Texas Red-labeled monoclonal antibodies against LAMP-2 (Washington Biotechnology Inc., Baltimore, MD). Slides were studied on a Zeiss LSM510 inverted confocal microscope (Zeiss). Electron Microscopy—The fibroblasts cell lines were trypsinized, pelleted, and fixed for 1 h with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer. After embedding in 2% agarose, the cells were post-fixed with osmium ferrocyanide. Increasing concentrations of ethanol were used for subsequent dehydration. The cells were then embedded in Epon. Semithin sections were cut and mounted on 200 mesh copper grids. Staining of the grids was done with uranyl acetate for 5 min followed by lead citrate for 2 min as described (33Igdoura S.A. Rasky A. Morales C.R. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 283: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34Lefrancois S. Michaud L. Potier M. Igdoura S.A. Morales C.R. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 17188-17199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The grids were viewed on a JEOL JEM-2000 FX electron microscope. Lysosomes were identified by using the following morphological criteria: lysosomes have to be spherical, ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 μm in diameter, and have moderate to strong electron density (33Igdoura S.A. Rasky A. Morales C.R. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 283: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34Lefrancois S. Michaud L. Potier M. Igdoura S.A. Morales C.R. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1593-1603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sometimes secretory granules may fall within this morphological description. However, the employed cell line used in this investigation was derived from fibroblasts, which do not contain secretory granules. For both Neu1 and Neu4-transfected fibroblasts, ∼100 cells per grid (n = 3) were counted and classified according to the characteristic of their lysosomes as rescued or nonrescued cells. In the case of the galactosialidosis cell line transfected with the Neu4 construct, it was also possible to identify and count partially rescued cells. Metabolic Labeling of Neu4 with [32P]Phosphate—Twenty-four hours after transfection with Neu4-FLAG plasmid, COS-7 cells were incubated for 15 min in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and for 3 h in the same medium supplemented with [32P]phosphate (ICN, Irvine, CA), 0.1 mCi/ml. The radioactive medium was then removed. Cells were placed on ice, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and lysed for 30 min in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl,1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm α-toluenesulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The lysate was collected and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min to remove the cell debris. The purification of Neu4-FLAG on the immunoaffinity gel (Sigma) was done as recommended by the manufacturer. Neu4-FLAG was eluted with the 100 μg/ml solution of the FLAG peptide (Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline. The eluted fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining and autoradiographic detection. Detectable bands were excised for MS analysis. A second sample prior to SDS analysis was deglycosylated with endoglycosidase H. Endoglycosidase H (Sigma) was added to the sample in a final concentration of 50 milliunits/ml, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. MS Identification—In-gel digestion of proteins and extraction of peptides was performed as described (36Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by an LC-MS/MS system consisting of a nanoflow liquid chromatography system and an ion trap 1100 series LC MSD mass spectrometer (NanoFlow Proteomics Solution, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Peptides were separated by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a Zorbax 300SB-C18 column (Agilent) with a gradient of 3-90% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. The column eluent was sprayed directly into the mass spectrometer. Spectra were searched against NCBI NR data base (NCBI, Bethesda, MD) using a Spectrum Mill software (Agilent). Northern Blot Analysis—A 12-lane MTN blot containing 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from various human tissues per lane (Clontech) was hybridized with the following probes: a 500-bp Neu4 cDNA fragment obtained from clone 4156395 by PvuII digestion, an entire Neu1 cDNA, a 700-bp Neu3 fragment obtained from a cDNA clone by PstI digestion, and an entire cDNA of human β-actin. All probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming using a MegaPrime labeling kit (Amer-sham Biosciences). Pre-hybridization of the blots was performed at 68 °C for 30 min in ExpressHybTM (Clontech). The denatured probes were added directly to the pre-hybridization solution and incubated at 68 °C for 1 h. The blots were washed twice for 30 min with 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS at room temperature, once for 40 min with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C, and exposed to a BioMax film overnight at -80 °C. Sialidase Activity of Neu4—Sequencing and annotation of the human genome predicted the presence on chromosome 2 of a gene presumably coding for another sialidase (NEU4) with an amino acid sequence homology to Neu1, Neu2, and Neu3. Our recent experiments aimed on analysis of the proteome of rat liver lysosome have identified MS and MS/MS spectra of the peptide VPALLCVPPRPTLLAFAEQR derived from the sequence of gene product XP_237421 (GI:34877834), the rat analog of human NEU4. 2K. Landry, M. Ashmarina, and A. V. Pshezhetsky, unpublished observations. These results suggested that NEU4 is expressed at least in rat liver and inspired further studies of this protein. The alignment of the human Neu4 amino acid sequence with those of crystallized bacterial sialidases (Fig. 1a) demonstrated conservation in Neu4 of all important active site residues, which bind the carboxylate group of the sialic acid substrate (Arg-35, -254, and -401) as well as N-acetyl-/N-glycolyl-binding active site residues (Asn-98) and suggested that Neu4 may have sialidase activity. The topology of secondary structural elements such as antiparallel β-strands or the so-called “Asp boxes” (Ser/Thr-X-Asp-X-Gly-X-X-Trp/Phe) is also conserved in Neu4 (Fig. 1a). Asp boxes are found in all bacterial and mammalian sialidases always on the turns between βD and βE, βH and βI, βN and βO, and βS and βT, i.e. between the third and the fourth β-strand of each sheet. All Asp boxes have similar conformation with the aromatic residues packed into the hydrophobic core that stabilizes the turn, whereas the hydrophilic Asp residues are always exposed to the solvent. Neu4 therefore most probably shares general “sialidase fold” consisting of six four-stranded antiparallel β-sheets arranged as the blades of a propeller around a pseudo 6-fold axis (37Varghese J.N. Laver W.G. Colman P.M. Nature. 1983; 303: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar).Fig. 1Catalytic activity of Neu4. a, partial amino acid sequence alignment of human Neu4 (residues 16-480) with homologous sialidases from Vibrio cholerae (KIT, GenBank™ accession number NP_231419), Micromonospora viridifaciens (EUR, accession number A45244), Salmonella typhimurium (SIL, accession number AAL19864), as well as human cytosolic (Neu2, accession number, NP_005374, residues 6-379) and lysosomal sialidases (Neu1, accession number NM_000434, residues 61-415). The identical residues are boxed. Active site residues are shown as black on yellow and Asp box repeats as black on blue. The β-sheets in the structures of bacterial sialidases are indicated by arrows above the alignment. b, pH dependence of the maximal reaction rate of the 4-MU-NANA hydrolysis catalyzed by Neu1, Neu3, and Neu4. Human Neu1, Neu3, and Neu4 were expressed in COS-7 cells, and their activity was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Data represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. c, substrate specificity of human Neu1, Neu3, and Neu4. Enzymatic activity of human Neu1, Neu3, and Neu4 expressed in COS-7 cells against bovine mucin, sialyllactose, 4-MU-NANA, and mixed bovine gangliosides was measured at pH optimum for each enzyme as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) By using the synthetic fluorescent substrate 2′-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (4-MU-NANA), we demonstrated that the NEU4 gene product indeed had sialidase activity. COS-7 cells transfected with the Neu4 cDNA showed a 10-fold increase in sialidase activity compared with mock-transfected cells. The pH-optimum was 3.5, i.e. close to that of Neu1 and Neu3 but in contrast to those enzymes Neu4 retained almost 40% of its maximal activity at higher pH (Fig. 1b). Although all mammalian sialidases show activity against 4-MU-NANA, they differ in their specificity against natural substrates, Neu1 being most active on oligosaccharides and Neu2 and Neu3 on glycolipids (16Sasaki A. Hata K. Suzuki S. Sawada M. Wada T. Yamaguchi K. Obinata M. Tateno H. Suzuki H. Miyagi T. J. Biol.

Human Neu4 showed broad substrate specificity (Fig. 1c), being almost equally active on glycoproteins (mucin), oligosaccharides (sialyllactose), 4-MU-NANA, and sialylated glycolipids (mixed bovine gangliosides). Intracellular Localization and Trafficking of Neu4—Our results indicate that Neu4 localizes to lysosomes. First, confocal fluorescent microscopy showed that Neu4 tagged with GFP or FLAG peptides was targeted in COS-7 cells and human fibroblasts to cytoplasmic organelles co-localizing with the lysosomal markers LysoTracker Red (Fig. 2, a and b) or LAMP-2 (not shown). Second, the majority of Neu4-related sialidase activity in the COS-7 cells transfected with pCMV-SPORT-Neu4 was found in the light mitochondrial fraction-enriched in lysosomes and containing most of the lysosomal β-hexosaminidase activity (Fig. 2c). When the light mitochondrial fraction was further analyzed by density gradient ultracentrifugation, Neu4 activity was found exclusively in the fractions containing lysosomes and marked by the presence of β-hexosaminidase (Fig. 2d) and β-galactosidase (not shown). 97% of the Neu4-related sialidase activity in COS-7 cells transfected with Neu4-FLAG cDNA was found in the supernatant after the centrifugation of the sonicated cell homogenate at 100,000 × g for 1 h (not shown). These data suggest that in contrast to an integral lysosomal membrane protein, Neu1, which cannot be solubilized without detergent (23Lukong K.E. Seyrantepe V. Landry K. Trudel S. Ahmad A. Gahl W.A. Lefrancois S. Morales C.R. Pshezhetsky A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46172-46181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), Neu4 is a soluble hydrolase located in the lysosomal lumen. This is also consistent with the results of computer analysis of the Neu4 amino acid sequence by the Classification and Secondary Structure Prediction of Membrane Proteins algorithm (SOSUI system, Department of Biotechnology, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology; sosui.proteome.bio.tuat.ac.jp/sosuiframe0.html) which predicted that Neu4 is a soluble protein, whereas Neu1 and Neu3 both contain transmembrane helixes. With rare exceptions, precursors of lysosomal luminal proteins are targeted by the mannose 6-phosphate receptor. Our data demonstrate that Neu4 is also transported by this mechanism. Neu4 binds to a concanavalin A-Sepharose (not shown) suggesting that it is glycosylated. To detect if Neu4 precursor is phosphorylated, we performed 32P-labeling of COS-7 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged Neu4. Proteins purified from the cell lysate on anti-FLAG immunoaffinity column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with autoradiographic detection. Altogether we found five phosphorylated protein bands (Fig. 3a, Neu4). Three of those bands were also present in the immunopurified fraction of mock-transfected cells (Fig. 3a, Mock) and probably represented phosphorylated proteins non-specifically absorbed on the matrix. Of the other two bands, the upper band (60 kDa) cross-reacted with anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 3b). We therefore excised it from gel (Fig. 3c), digested with trypsin, and analyzed tryptic peptides by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). MS/MS identified the 60-kDa band as human Neu4 (gi21704287) with 18% sequence coverage (Fig. 3d). When the immunopurified sample was treated with endoglycosidase H, the phosphorylation of Neu4 was not detected showing that the phosphate label is on the oligosaccharide portion of the enzyme rather then on polypeptide chain (Fig. 3c). Further evidence that Neu4 is targeted by the mannose 6-phosphate receptor was obtained when we found that it is deficient in mucolipidosis II cells (ML II, OMIM 252500). ML II is caused by genetic deficiency of UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase, which is necessary for generation of mannose 6-phosphate signal in precursors of soluble lysosomal enzymes (38Kornfeld S.

However, the exact molecular mechanisms triggered by oxidative stress in photoreceptor cell death remain undefined. This study delineates the molecular events that occur after treatment of the photoreceptor cell line 661W with the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Cytosolic calcium levels increased during photoreceptor apoptosis, leading to activation of the calcium-dependent proteases calpains. Furthermore, caspase activation also occurred following SNP insult. However, although treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone inhibited caspase activity per se in SNP-treated 661W cells, it did not prevent apoptosis. On the other hand, CR-6 (3,4-dihydro-6-hydroxy-7-methoxy-2,2-dimethyl-1(2H)-benzopyran) acted as a scavenger of ROS and reduced 661W photoreceptor apoptosis induced by SNP by preventing the activation of a pathway in which calpains have a key role. In summary, we report for the first time that both caspases and calpains are involved in 661W photoreceptor apoptosis and that calpain activation can be prevented by the ROS scavenger CR-6.

In summary, we report for the first time that both caspases and calpains are involved in 661W photoreceptor apoptosis and that calpain activation can be prevented by the ROS scavenger CR-6. The cell death process of apoptosis is characterized by a series of morphological and biochemical changes, including membrane blebbing, loss of plasma membrane asymmetry, chromatin cleavage, and DNA fragmentation (1Kaufmann S.H.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Apoptosis plays a central role in tissue modeling during development and, together with the cell-generating process of mitosis, is responsible for the maintenance of cell numbers in multicellular organisms. Deregulation of apoptosis has been well documented in several human pathologies, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and AIDS (3Migliore L. Coppede F. Mutat. Res. 2002; 512: 135-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 4Olinski R. Gackowski D. Foksinski M. Rozalski R. Roszkowski K. Jaruga P. Free Radic. Biol.

Apoptosis also appears to be responsible for the cell loss seen in several disorders of the retina, including retinitis pigmentosa (a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders), glaucoma, and macular degeneration (5Chang G.Q.

Experiments aimed at unraveling the signaling pathways of apoptosis have identified several distinct mechanisms, and it has largely been accepted that caspases play a key role in both the initiation and execution pathways of apoptosis. However, the involvement of caspases does not seem to be clear-cut in some tissue systems. For example, there is still considerable controversy as to whether caspases play a role in retinal cell death (9Liu C. Li Y. Peng M. Laties A.M. Wen R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4778-4785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Carmody R.J. Cotter T.G. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 11Donovan M. Carmody R.J.

Rakic P. Roth K.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 59: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recent work from our laboratory has indicated that photoreceptor death in animal models of retinitis pigmentosa proceeds in the absence of caspase activity, suggesting a caspase-independent mechanism of cell destruction (11Donovan M. Carmody R.J. Cotter T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23000-23008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 12Donovan M. Cotter T.G.

The exact mechanisms operating in photoreceptor death are still unclear but may involve calpains rather than caspases as the executing enzymes. These studies also suggested a key role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; RNI, reactive nitrogen intermediates; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; Z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase; Ac-DEVD-pNA, acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp p-nitroanilide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RNI, reactive nitrogen intermediate(s); DHE, dihydroethidium; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; RNI, reactive nitrogen intermediates; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; Z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase; Ac-DEVD-pNA, acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp p-nitroanilide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RNI, reactive nitrogen intermediate(s); DHE, dihydroethidium; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. and reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) since inhibitors of nitric-oxide synthase blocked the cell death seen. These results are quite interesting since several studies have indicated that the eye is particularly sensitive to oxidative stress and therefore, modifications of the cellular redox state of the eye have been reported to play an important role in retinal degeneration processes (17Liang F.Q.

Additional support for the involvement of ROS and oxidative stress in photoreceptor apoptosis comes from several studies in which antioxidants appeared to retard or inhibit the degenerative pathology (21Lam S. Tso M.O. Gurne D.H. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1990; 108: 1751-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Ranchon I. Gorrand J.M. Cluzel J. Droy-Lefaix M.T. Doly M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

However, the mechanisms of action of these anti-apoptotic molecules are unclear, and further work is necessary to resolve whether oxidative stress acts as a common mediator of retinal degeneration in retinitis pigmentosa. The retina is composed of several different cell types, and this complicates any studies aimed at delineating the underlying mechanism of photoreceptor apoptosis. The production and characterization of the photoreceptor cell line 661W by Al-Ubaidi et al. (24Al-Ubaidi M.R. Font R.L. Quiambao A.B. Keener M.J. Liou G.I. Overbeek P.A. Baehr W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1681-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) have greatly facilitated work in this area. This cell line expresses several markers of photoreceptors and has proved useful for in vitro studies investigating photoreceptor apoptosis (19Crawford M.J. Krishnamoorthy R.R. Rudick V.L.

Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 3583-3589PubMed Google Scholar). In the context of this work, we have used this cell line to investigate the role played by oxidative stress in photoreceptor apoptosis induced by the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP). This constitutes a direct extension of previous work from this laboratory (11Donovan M. Carmody R.J. Cotter T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23000-23008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) in which we showed that nitric oxide and ROS play a key role in driving photoreceptor apoptosis in vivo. In this study, we show that SNP induced ROS production in the mitochondrion and that this in turn triggered apoptosis, with both calpains and caspases playing a role. Treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk) inhibited the activation of caspases, but does not appear to be a useful strategy to prevent oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in 661W photoreceptor cells. On the other hand, in the context of this work, we show that CR-6 (a vitamin E analog that has been shown to prevent glutamate neurotoxicity in cultured neurons due to its role as a nitric oxide scavenger (27Montoliu C. Llansola M. Saez R. Yenes S. Messeguer A. Felipo V. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)), interfered with oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in 661W cells by preventing the activation of the calpain-mediated apoptotic pathway. Drugs, Reagents, and Antibodies—SNP was purchased from Sigma (Poole, United Kingdom). The synthesis of CR-6 has been described elsewhere (28Casas J. Gorchs G. Sanchez-Baeza F. Teixidor P. Messeguer A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1992; 40: 585-590Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) provided antipoly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (catalog no. 9542), anti-caspase-3 (catalog no. 9662), anti-caspase-9 (catalog no. 9504), and anticaspase-12 (catalog no. 2202) antibodies. Anti-Calpain-1 (catalog no. 208753) and anti-calpain-2 (catalog no. 208755) antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-calpastatin (sc-7561) and anti-calpain small regulatory subunit (C-20; sc-7528) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-β-actin antibody was from Sigma. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-goat, and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were obtained from Dako Corp. The broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk was purchased from Bachem Ltd. (Meyerside, United Kingdom). Alexis Co. (Läufefingen, Switzerland) provided the caspase-3 substrate acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp p-nitroanilide (Ac-DEVD-pNA). Cell Culture—661W cells were kindly provided by Muayyad Al-Ubaidi, Department of Cell Biology, University of Oklahoma (Oklahoma City, OK). 661W cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (both from Sigma) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere as described (20Krishnamoorthy R.R. Crawford M.J. Chaturvedi M.M. Jain S.K. Aggarwal B.B. Al-Ubaidi M.R. Agarwal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3734-3743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). SNP was used to induce apoptosis at the doses indicated; SNP stock was prepared at 100 mm in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4). Pretreatment of 661W photoreceptors with CR-6 was done for 15 min at 37 °C as described above. A 100 mm CR-6 stock was prepared in Me2SO. Treatments carried out in 6-well plates (Nalge Nunc International, Hereford, United Kingdom) were as follow. Cells (75 × 104/well) were seeded and allowed to attach for 20 h at 37 °C. Following insult, cells were detached with a trypsin/EDTA solution (Sigma) and collected together with their supernatants for flow cytometric analysis. Cells for Western blot analysis were grown in 75-cm2 flasks (Sarstedt AG & Co., Nümbrecht, Germany). Initially, cells (8 × 105/flask) were seeded and allowed to attach before treatment. Samples were collected 24 or 48 h post-insult. Analysis of Generated RNI: Griess Reaction—Determination of the presence of RNI was done by means of the Griess reaction (29Marzinzig M. Nussler A.K. Stadler J. Marzinzig E. Barthlen W. Nussler N.C. Beger H.G. Morris Jr., S.M. Bruckner U.B. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1 (S. M. J.): 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 104) were incubated for 15 min in the dark at room temperature with 40 μl of Griess reagent (Alexis Corp.). Nitrites present in the samples react with sulfanilic acid and N-(1-naphthly)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride in the presence of phosphoric acid, which produces a colored azo dye that can be measured at 548 nm. Analysis of Intracellular ROS Generation—Measurement of superoxide anion levels was carried out as described previously (30Gorman A. McGowan A. Cotter T.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were loaded with 10 μm dihydroethidium (DHE) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Leiden, The Netherlands), prepared from a 10 mm stock in Me2SO, for 15 min at 37 °C. Superoxide anion oxidizes DHE intracellularly to produce ethidium bromide, which fluoresces upon interaction with DNA. The fluorescence due to ethidium bromide in a BD Biosciences FACScan flow cytometer with excitation and emission settings of 488 and 590 nm, respectively, was monitored to assess superoxide anion levels. CellQuest software was used for data analysis, and 10,000 events/sample were acquired. Cell Death Measurement—Propidium iodide (Sigma) was used to quantify cell death. Treated cells were collected as described above, washed once with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended to a final concentration of 1 × 105 cells/ml. Propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) was added immediately before flow cytometric analysis. Fluorescence was measured at FL2 (590 nm), and 10,000 events/sample were acquired. Measurement of Intracellular Free Ca2+—Intracellular Ca2+ levels were determined using the intracellular Ca2+ probe Fluo-3/acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc.), which binds Ca2+ with a 1:1 stoichiometry. After trypsinization, cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in fresh buffer. Cells were incubated in the darkness with 250 nm Fluo-3, prepared from a 500 μm stock, for 30 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence was measured at FL1 (530 nm) in a BD Biosciences FACScan flow cytometer with excitation at 488 nm, and CellQuest software was employed for subsequent data analysis. At least 10,000 events/sample were acquired. Western Blot Analysis—After exposure to drug, whole cell extracts were obtained and resolved by denaturing SDS-PAGE. Briefly, harvested cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS; resuspended in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.25% sodium deoxycholate) containing antipain (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), chymostatin (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (0.1 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), and 0.2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; and incubated on ice for 20 min. Supernatants were recovered by a 10-min centrifugation (10,000 × g) at 4 °C, and protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Proteins (20–40 μg) were diluted in 2× sample buffer (10% SDS and 100 mm each dithiothreitol, glycerol, bromphenol blue, and Tris-HCl) and resolved on 6–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Then proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll, Dassel, Germany), and the blots were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate dilution of primary antibody (1:5000 for anti-m-calpain and anti-μ-calpain antibodies and 1:1000 for all other antibodies). After three 5-min washes with Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20, the blots were incubated with the corresponding peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. They were then washed again three times with Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20, rinsed briefly with PBS, and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Detection of β-actin (1:5000 antibody dilution) was used as control for equal loading of protein. Determination of Ac-DEVD-pNA Cleavage—661W cells (8 × 105) were grown in 75-cm2 flasks and preincubated at 37 °C with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (50 μm) for 1 h prior to insult with 0.3 mm SNP. Untreated and 0.3 mm SNP-treated 661W cells were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. After a 24-h incubation, cells were collected as described above and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 1× PBS and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. Subsequently, the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 m NaCl, 1% CHAPS, 1 m dithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Following a 20-s sonication, cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,500 × g. The protein content of each sample was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. An equal quantity of protein (50 μg) was loaded into each well of a microtiter plate, and the final volume was made up to 90 μl with assay buffer (same as lysis buffer minus 1% Nonidet P-40). Lysates were incubated with 0.2 mm Ac-DEVD-pNA at 37 °C for 20 h. Cleavage of the peptide substrate DEVD-pNA was monitored by liberation of chromogenic pNA in a SpectraMax-340 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA) by measuring absorption at 405 nm. Annexin V Assay—A combined staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide was performed as a measure of apoptosis. Harvested cells were washed once with Ca2+ binding buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2) and resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V (IQ Products, Groningen, The Netherlands). After a 15-min incubation in the dark at room temperature, cells were diluted with 400 μl of binding buffer, and propidium iodide was added before flow cytometric analysis. Fluorescence was measured as described above. SNP Induces ROS Production and Cell Death in the Photoreceptor Cell Line 661W—Oxidative stress has been reported to play an important role in photoreceptor cell death (18Carmody R.J. McGowan A.J. Cotter T.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 520-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Krishnamoorthy R.R. Crawford M.J. Chaturvedi M.M. Jain S.K. Aggarwal B.B. Al-Ubaidi M.R. Agarwal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3734-3743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Previous work carried out in this laboratory demonstrated that nitric oxide mediates retinal degeneration in vivo and that ROS significantly contribute to photoreceptor cell death (11Donovan M. Carmody R.J. Cotter T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23000-23008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Despite these findings, the mechanisms leading to photoreceptor apoptosis are still not fully understood, and little is known about oxidative pathways involved in retinal death. Therefore, to gain a better understanding of the events triggered by RNI and ROS in photoreceptors, the 661W cell line was treated with increasing concentrations of the nitric oxide donor SNP (0.1–0.5 mm) for 20 h. Previous studies have shown that SNP can trigger apoptosis in neurons (31Tamatani M. Ogawa S. Nunez G. Tohyama M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The production of nitric oxide metabolites was detected with the Griess reaction (29Marzinzig M. Nussler A.K. Stadler J. Marzinzig E. Barthlen W. Nussler N.C. Beger H.G. Morris Jr., S.M. Bruckner U.B. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1 (S. M. J.): 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In this method, nitrite metabolites are detected with a colorimetric reaction. Therefore, the value of the resulting absorbance is proportional to the amount of RNI present in the samples. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, an increase in nitric oxide metabolites was observed in 661W photoreceptor cells upon treatment with up to a concentration of SNP of 0.3 mm. Higher concentrations of SNP did not significantly modify the concentration of RNI in the cells.Fig. 1SNP-induced RNI and ROS production and apoptotic cell death in the photoreceptor cell line 661W. 661W cells were treated with increasing concentrations of SNP (0.1–0.5 mm) for 20 h. A, the presence of nitric oxide metabolites was detected colorimetrically by the Griess reaction. The error bars correspond to the S.D. of three independent experiments done in duplicate. B, superoxide anion levels were quantified by flow cytometry using the probe DHE prior to SNP treatment (0 mm) and after treatment with 0.1–0.5 mm SNP. The percentage of cells displaying increased levels of ROS is shown at each SNP concentration. Results are representative of three independent experiments done in duplicate. C, cell death measurements were done by flow cytometry using propidium iodide. Dot plots show that treatment of 661W photoreceptor cells with the nitric oxide donor SNP induced oxidative stress, leading to cell death. Results are representative of three independent experiments carried out in duplicate. FSC-H, forward-angle light scatter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In parallel with this study, superoxide anion formation was monitored using the probe DHE (Fig. 1B). Contrary to results observed for RNI, treatment with the lowest concentrations of SNP (0.1–0.2 mm) did not significantly alter the levels of superoxide anions present in 661W cells, and increased levels of ROS were not detected until treatment with 0.3 mm SNP. Incubation with 0.5 mm SNP increased superoxide anion levels up to 73%, indicating a modification of the redox state in 661W cells. Quantification of cell death was performed by flow cytometric analysis. Propidium iodide was used to quantify the population of cells in which membrane integrity was lost. As expected, treatment of 661W cells with SNP (0.1–0.5 mm) induced cell death, with only 29% of cells surviving post-insult with 0.5 mm SNP (Fig. 1C). Nevertheless, an SNP concentration of 0.3 mm, which resulted in ∼50% cell death, was chosen for further studies. Apoptotic cell death was then assessed by detection of DNA fragmentation by DNA gel electrophoresis after treatment with 0.3 mm SNP. The presence of the DNA ladder was detected 48 h post-insult (data not shown). In conclusion, these results confirm and extend previous observations showing the involvement of ROS in photoreceptor cell death (11Donovan M. Carmody R.J. Cotter T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23000-23008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 12Donovan M. Cotter T.G.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5723-5731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 661W Photoreceptor Cell Death Induced by SNP Is Mediated by an Increase in Intracellular Ca2+Levels and Calpain Activation—In the cell, oxidative stress induces Ca2+ influx from the extracellular environment and efflux from intracellular stores, leading to an increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels, which has been associated with apoptosis in diverse in vivo and in vitro systems (32Berridge M.J.

It has also been shown that elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels play a role in rod photoreceptor apoptosis (11Donovan M. Carmody R.J. Cotter T.G. J. Biol.

In this study, intracellular Ca2+ levels were determined using the fluorescent probe Fluo-3/acetoxymethyl ester. To ensure that SNP treatment of 661W photoreceptor cells increased [Ca2+]i, calcium levels in untreated 661W cells were compared with those in cells incubated with 0.3 mm SNP for 20 h. As depicted in the histogram in Fig. 2A, treatment of 661W cells with 0.3 mm SNP produced an increase in FL1 fluorescence, indicating an increased concentration of intracellular calcium. Activation of calcium-dependent proteases such as calpains is thought to play an important role in certain models of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (35Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J.

In addition, several studies have shown that calpains can contribute to neuronal death (38McCollum A.T. Nasr P. Estus S. J.

Previous work from this laboratory has reported the activation of calpains during light-induced retinal degeneration (12Donovan M. Cotter T.G. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1220-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To verify the activation of calpains in 661W cells following increased levels of intracellular Ca2+, we performed immunoblot analyses using polyclonal antibodies against the calpain isoforms m-calpain and μ-calpain. Moreover, we also analyzed the common small regulatory subunit of calpains, which is dissociated in response to increased levels of cytosolic calcium (44Pal G.P. Elce J.S. Jia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47233-47238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 2B, a decrease in the total amount of m-calpain was observed after a 24-h treatment of 661W cells with 0.3 mm SNP (50% cell death). The reduction in calpain levels was even more evident after 48 h (76% cell death). Although calpains require only an increase in [Ca2+]i to become active, the a"

It is becoming evident that membrane proteins rarely function as independent units. Instead, these proteins are commonly coassembled in larger functional domains. Such domains may consist of various membrane proteins, a number of scaffolding proteins, and different intracellular components with catalytical functions. As an example, in a series of studies Ca2+-activated potassium channels with big conductance (BK) 1The abbreviations used are: BK channels, big conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channels; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; IbTX, iberiotoxin; IK channels, intermediate conductance potassium channels; RIA, radioimmunoassay; SK channels, small conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channels; TBS, Tris-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: BK channels, big conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channels; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; IbTX, iberiotoxin; IK channels, intermediate conductance potassium channels; RIA, radioimmunoassay; SK channels, small conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channels; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. have been demonstrated to be functionally coupled to a number of other membrane proteins including voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (1Gola M.

Neuron. 2001; 31: 1027-1034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These studies are all based on functional experiments. However, demonstration of a direct assembly of these proteins has still to be completed. Virtually all cell types, including neurons, express at least some type of Ca2+-activated potassium channels (13Ashcroft F.M. Ion Channels and Disease. Academic Press, San Diego2000: 125-134Crossref Google Scholar). Three broad families of Ca2+-activated potassium channels are known. These have been classified in terms of their single channel conductance into small conductance (SK1–3 or KCNN1–3), intermediate conductance (IK or KCNN4), and big conductance (BK or KCNMA1) channels. They share the common feature of being sensitive to cytosolic Ca2+. Potassium permeability is changed in response to alterations in the Ca2+ concentration in the micro- to nanomolar range. In contrast to SK and IK channels, BK channels are not only Ca2+ sensitive but also gated by voltage (14Latorre R. Oberhauser A. Labarca P. Alvarez O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Functional BK channels (also called maxi-K or slo channels) are tetrameric structures consisting of four pore forming α subunits (the principal subunits). In addition, four different β subunits (auxiliary subunits) have been identified (15Brenner R. Jegla T.J. Wickenden A. Liu Y. Aldrich R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6453-6461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 16Knaus H.G. Folander K. Garcia-Calvo M. Garcia M.L. Kaczorowski G.J. Smith M. Swanson R. J. Biol.

The Ca2+ channel family is classified into at least six major groups (N-, L-, P-, Q-, T-, and R-type) on the basis of biophysical and pharmacological features. Members of this family comprise a single pore-forming α1 subunit and four auxiliary subunits named α2, β, δ, and γ (20Catterall W.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 707: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cloning of Ca2+ channels gave rise to a subdivision of these groups according to the primary sequence of the principal subunits (α1). According to this nomenclature, four different α1 subunits have been identified which refer to voltage-gated Ca2+ channels of the L-type. These are α1C, α1D, α1S, and α1F (21Birnbaumer L. Campbell K.P. Catterall W.A. Harpold M.M. Hofmann F. Horne W.A. Mori Y. Schwartz A. Snutch T.P. Tanabe T. Neuron. 1994; 13: 505-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 22Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). Various types of neurons express some or all of these channels in different proportions. BK channels are localized in the presynaptic membrane of hippocampal neurons facing the synaptic cleft in terminals of Schaffer collaterals (23Hu H. Shao L.R. Chavoshy S. Gu N. Trieb M. Behrens R. Laake P. Pongs O. Knaus H.G. Ottersen O.P. Storm J.F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9585-9597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In neurons firing with high frequency, the membrane depolarization, together with presynaptic Ca2+ influx, is thought to be sufficient to activate BK channels. This BK activation will prevent neuronal hyperexcitability by initiating a repolarization of the membrane. BK channels thereby act as a kind of “emergency brake” (2Marrion N.V. Tavalin S.J. Nature. 1998; 395: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 24Knaus H.G. Schwarzer C. Koch R.O. Eberhart A. Kaczorowski G.J. Glossmann H. Wunder F. Pongs O. Garcia M.L. Sperk G. J.

It has also been demonstrated that activation of BK channels can be accomplished in less than 0.5 ms by Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels during a single action potential in hippocampal pyramidal cells (2Marrion N.V. Tavalin S.J. Nature. 1998; 395: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 26Lancaster B. Nicoll R.A. J. Physiol. 1987; 389: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 27Storm J.F.

Keeping the enormous cellular Ca2+ buffering capacity in mind, this rapid activation requires an intimate association of both channel types. The nature of the apparent coupling is still not known. It is uncertain whether these channels are located in close proximity or actually linked together. Further, it is debated which types of voltage-gated Ca2+ channel are involved. The present study was therefore devoted to investigating direct coassembly of BK channels and certain types of voltage-gated Ca2+ channel. Materials—An iberiotoxin double mutant was engineered, purified, and radioiodinated with 125I (125I-IbTX-D19Y/Y36F) as described previously (29Koschak A. Koch R.O. Liu J. Kaczorowski G.J. Reinhart P.H. Garcia M.L. Knaus H.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1943-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Isradipine ((+)-3H-PN200–110) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Affinity-purified alkaline phosphatase- or peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Jackson & Jackson or Sigma. Avidin-biotinylated horseradish complex reagent and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine was from Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA. Scintillation fluid was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Sepharose 4B was from Amersham Biosciences. Water-soluble digitonin, special grade, was from Biosynth AG, Staad, Switzerland. Deoxycholate, cholate, CHAPS, Triton X-100, protein A-Sepharose 4B, EDTA, BSA, iodoacetamide, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, benzamide, pepstatin A, and H2O2 were from Sigma. All other reagents employed were of the highest purity grade commercial available. Membrane Preparation—Membrane preparation was slightly modified from Knaus et al. (24Knaus H.G. Schwarzer C. Koch R.O. Eberhart A. Kaczorowski G.J. Glossmann H. Wunder F. Pongs O. Garcia M.L. Sperk G. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 955-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In short, Wistar rats (200–300 g) were killed by cervical dislocation. The brains were transferred immediately to ice-cold homogenization buffer consisting of (in mm) 320 sucrose, 1 EDTA, 10 Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1 iodoacetamide, 0.01 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 benzamide, 0.001 pepstatin A. After 12 × Dounce homogenization in ice the homogenate was subjected to 2 × low speed centrifugation at 823 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer and loaded on a 7.5/10% Ficoll gradient afterward. The gradient was subjected to high speed centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The fraction between the synaptosome suspension and 7.5% Ficoll (“supernatant”) was centrifuged in homogenization buffer at 200,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, the pellet resuspended in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. The fraction between 7.5 and 10% Ficoll (“interface”) was centrifuged in homogenization buffer at 14,290 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of homogenization buffer and transferred to 500 ml of 5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, for 45 min at 4 °C on a stirring plate for cell lysis. The suspension was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C and the pellet processed like the supernatant fraction. Antibody Production and Affinity Purification—All applied antibodies were purified from polyclonal sera raised in rabbits using immunogenic peptides of the following sequences: BK channel α subunit, residue positions 913–926 (VND TNV QFL DQD DD) of mSlo (anti-α(913–926)); L-type α1C subunit, residue positions 818–835 (anti-α1C (818–835)), and L-type α1D subunit, residue positions 2121–2137 (anti-α1D (2121–2137)). Antibodies were raised, affinity purified from respective immune sera, and characterized by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis as described previously (24Knaus H.G.

Kaufmann W.A. Trieb M. Schwarzer C. Storm J.F. Knaus H.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9698-9707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specificity of immunolabeling for all antibodies was confirmed (see Fig. 2). Immunoblotting—After running membranes on SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred under constant cooling onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Transfer was performed for 60 min under constant voltage (100 V) in a buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, 10% (v/v) methanol. After protein transfer, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in blocking buffer consisting of 10% low fat milk powder, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20, dissolved in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Membranes were then incubated overnight on a rocking plate at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted 1:1,000 in blocking buffer. Membranes were washed in washing buffer consisting of 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20, dissolved in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and incubated with affinity-purified alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Sigma) diluted 1:2,000 in blocking buffer for 90 min on a rocking plate at room temperature. After five washes in washing buffer, blots were developed in staining buffer consisting of 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.5, 0.045% nitro blue tetrazolium, and 0.035% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphatase until bands were clearly visible (4–10 min). The staining reaction was stopped by transfer of blots to staining buffer containing 20 mm EDTA and 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. Immunoprecipitation with Radioactive Ligands and Antibodies— 0.5–2 ml of rat brain membranes (2–8 mg of protein) was prelabeled overnight at room temperature in 20 ml of incubation buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1% BSA) with either 50–100 pm125I-IbTX-D19Y/Y36F (BK channel ligand), 20–50 pm125I-ω-conotoxin (N-type Ca2+ channel ligand), or 100–200 pm isradipine (L-type Ca2+ channel ligand). Incubation with isradipine was carried out in the dark. Prelabeled membranes were centrifuged for 10 min at 48,000 × g at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in solubilization buffer (2% detergent, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and placed on ice for 1 h. The volume of the buffer was adjusted to a protein:detergent ratio of 1:10. Solubilized membranes were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and solubilization efficiency was determined by counting bound counts before and after solubilization. For all immunoprecipitation studies antibodies were prebound to protein A immobilized on Sepharose 4B. Protein A-Sepharose 4B was swollen by washing three times in RIA buffer (0.1% detergent, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). Antibodies were bound to protein A by incubating varied amounts of serum with ∼100 μl of packed gel material and 250 μl of RIA buffer for >15 min at 4 °C at gentle rotation. The suspension was washed three times with RIA buffer before addition of 250 μl of RIA buffer and 50–150 μl of solubilized membranes. Incubation was then allowed to take place for >4 h at gentle rotation at 4 °C. After washing three times with RIA buffer the suspension was transferred to counting tubes and counted in a Cobra II auto γ counter or a Tri-Carb 2900TR liquid scintillation analyzer, both from Packard Bioscience. For β counting, 3 ml of scintillation fluid was used for each sample. When 125I-IbTX-D19Y/Y36F was used as ligand, paxilline was added to all buffers (final concentration, 375 nm). Immunoprecipitation with Antibodies—For these immunoprecipitation studies BK antibodies were prebound to Sepharose 4-B by washing 0.25 mg of Sepharose in 8.5 ml of dialyzed affinity-purified BK antibody for 60 min at 4 °C a gentle rotation. Dialyzing was performed in 0.1 m NaHCO3. Sepharose-antibody complexes were isolated by gentle centrifugation for 5 min at 2,000 × g. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in 10 ml of 100 mm glycine, pH 7.4, to block unbound Sepharose sites. Blocking was allowed to proceed for 60 min at 4 °C under gentle rotation. The suspension was filtered and washed with 1 liter of ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS) consisting of 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, at a metal grid. The Sepharose-antibody complex was recovered from the grid with a spatula, resuspended in 6 ml of TBS, and added to a column. Rat brain membranes were solubilized before loading at the column. This was obtained by washing 2-ml membranes in 20 ml of buffer consisting of 10 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 0.1% BSA followed by a 10-min centrifugation at 48,000 × g. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet solubilized in 4 ml of buffer consisting of 2% (w/v) digitonin, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, for 60 min at 0 °C. Membranes were then centrifuged for 30 min at 106.000 × g and the supernatant containing solubilized membranes loaded at the column in a total volume of 7 ml of 2% (w/v) digitonin, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4 and incubated overnight at 4 °C under gentle rotation. The column was washed five times with 0.1% digitonin, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and then eluted with 12 ml of 0.1% digitonin, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 m CAPS, pH 10.0. The eluate was kept on ice and neutralized immediately to pH 7.4 with HCl. After dialyzing overnight in 1 liter of 0.05% SDS, 5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, membranes were concentrated to 0.5 ml using a Centriprep 30 (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). SDS sample buffer was added and the samples heated to 56 °C for 10 min before being analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed as described above with the exception that secondary antibody was peroxidase conjugated and diluted 1:100,000 in 3% BSA, developed with Supersignal (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and exposed on Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Bioscience). Binding Studies—Binding studies were performed as described previously (29Koschak A. Koch R.O. Liu J. Kaczorowski G.J. Reinhart P.H. Garcia M.L. Knaus H.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1943-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—Adult Wistar rats were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital (150 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). Brains were perfusion fixed through the ascending aorta with 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (50 mm, pH 7.4) plus heparin (3,000 IU/liter) followed by 250 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 50 mm phosphate-buffered saline. Brains were removed immediately, postfixed in the same fixative for 60 min at 4 °C, and transferred to 5, 10, and 20% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline. They were rapidly frozen in isopentane (–45 °C) and stored at –70 °C. Serial coronal and sagittal sections (40 μm) were cut on a sliding cryostat (Microm, Walldorf, Germany) and kept in 0.1 m TBS (pH 7.2, containing 0.05% NaN3) at 4 °C. Consecutive brain sections were processed for immunohistochemistry using the peroxidase anti-peroxidase technique for free floating samples. Sections were rinsed in 0.1 m TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.4% Triton X-100) over a period of 2 h at room temperature (4 × 30 min). Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 0.9% H2O2 and 20% methanol in TBS followed by rinsing sections in TBS-T. Nonspecific binding sites were then blocked by incubating sections for 90 min on a rocker plate in TBS-T containing 2% BSA, 2% normal goat serum, and 0.2% milk powder. Primary antibodies were applied in TBS-T containing 1% BSA overnight at room temperature on a rocker plate. Antibody dilutions were: affinity-purified anti-BK Alpha-18, 2.2 ng/μl (1:2,000); CNC1 crude serum, 1:1,000; affinity-purified CND8, 1.8 ng/μl (1:1,500). Tissue sections were rinsed 4 × 5 min in TBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) diluted 1:400 in TBS-T buffer containing 1% BSA for 120 min at room temperature. The antigen-antibody complex was visualized by a reaction using 0.63 mm 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and 0.002% H2O2 in TBS, pH 7.6. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10–12 min and terminated by washing sections in TBS. Tissue sections were mounted on chromalaun gelatin-coated glass slides, air dried for 1 h, flushed with tap water followed by dH2O, dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, cleared in n-butylacetate, and coverslipped with Eukitt. Alternatively, sections were processed according to the avidin-biotinylated horseradish complex technique. Primary antisera were applied as described before. Thereafter, sections were washed in TBS-T, and goat anti-rabbit biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:200 in TBS-T containing 0.1% BSA; Vector Laboratories) were applied for 90 min at room temperature. Sections were rinsed in TBS-T again and treated with an avidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (1:200 in TBS-T containing 0.1% BSA) for 90 min at room temperature. The sections were reacted with 0.05% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and 0.003% H2O2 in TBS for 6–7 min, rinsed in TBS, mounted on glass slides, air dried, dehydrated, and covered with Eukitt. The specificity of the immunostaining was controlled by applying the respective preimmune serum or the immune serum preadsorbed with the synthetic immunogenic peptides (concentration, 10 μm). Statistics—The results from saturation immunoprecipitation experiments and saturation binding experiments were subjected to Michaelis-Menten analysis in which the equilibrium dissociation constant Kd and maximal receptor concentration Bmax were determined using Equation 1y=(Bmax·x)/(Kd+x)(Eq. 1) where y is the receptor concentration and x is the radioligand or antibody concentration. Resulting values are given as the mean ± S.E. Protein Determination—The protein concentrations of the membrane preparations were determined according to Bradford using BSA as a standard. Optimization of Immunoprecipitation Studies—Functional interaction of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and Ca2+-activated K+ channels has been suggested from a number of different electrophysiological experiments, but demonstration of direct coupling is still missing. Different kinds of immunoprecipitation were performed to investigate direct coupling of potassium channels of the BK type and L-type Ca2+ channels. Radiolabeled ligands exist for both BK and L-type Ca2+ channels. This raises the possibility of performing semiquantitative immunoprecipitation experiments. Membranes are labeled with a radioligand recognizing specifically either BK or L-type channels. Subsequently, immunoprecipitation is performed with antibodies recognizing the protein thought to interact with either of the two channels. Finally, the presence of BK or L-type channels in the precipitate is detected by counting the amount of radioactivity. In an initial experiment shown in Fig. 1A, rat brain membranes were labeled with the modified BK-specific scorpion toxin IbTX (125I-IbTX-D19Y/Y36F). In earlier studies this double mutated radiolabeled toxin has been demonstrated to interact specifically with BK channels in a manner no different from native IbTX (29Koschak A. Koch R.O. Liu J. Kaczorowski G.J. Reinhart P.H. Garcia M.L. Knaus H.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1943-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 33Grunnet M. Knaus H.G. Solander C. Klaerke D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G22-G30PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled membranes were subsequently precipitated with antibodies raised against different kinds of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. As a control, precipitation was performed using antibodies against BK channels (Alpha-18 antibody). Antibodies against both rat α1C and α1D L-type Ca2+ channels (CNC1 and CND8) precipitated IbTX binding, whereas antibodies against P/Q-type Ca2+ channels (CNA-C1), denaturated Ca2+ channel β subunits (RCP15), and rabbit L-type Ca2+ channels (CNCMCA-gly) hardly showed any precipitation. Measurements were performed in duplicate, and data were averaged. All data presented are specific precipitation values defined as the difference between total precipitation and precipitation obtained in the absence of antibody. Nonspecific precipitation was generally <5% of total precipitation. Remaining data are all presented in a similar manner. Several optimization experiments were carried out to determine the most favorable solubilization conditions. Rat brain membranes labeled with 125I-IbTX-D19Y/Y36F were incubated with five different detergents. The solubilization efficiency was 10.0% for cholate, 11.4% for deoxycholate, 19.4% for Triton X-100, 12.9% for CHAPS, and 14.8% for digitonin. After solubilization, membranes were precipitated with two different concentrations (5 and 10 μl) of L-type Ca2+ channel-specific antibodies (Fig. 1B). The highest amount of specific precipitation was obtained for deoxycholate- and digitonin-solubilized membranes. Deoxycholate was seen to cause nonspecific precipitation using radioligands other than IbTX (e.g. ω-conotoxin; data not shown). Furthermore, digitonin has been shown previously to be a good detergent when working with ion channels (33Grunnet M. Knaus H.G. Solander C. Klaerke D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G22-G30PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, digitonin was used as detergent in the following experiments. The overall digitonin solubilization efficiency for IbTX-labeled membranes was 13.6 ± 3% (n = 11) and for isradipine-labeled membranes 23.2% ± 4% (n = 5). Membrane solubilization is in general more efficient in the presence of K+ compared with Na+. At the same time, K+ compromises IbTX interaction with BK channels. Optimization of the ion composition for the solubilization buffer was therefore performed and revealed 150 mm NaCl without any KCl to be most suitable for the experiments conducted in this study (data not shown). In a final optimization step, the reactivity of applied antibodies was tested. Immunoprecipitation was performed with preimmune serum or serum from early bleeds and the results compared with precipitation performed with antisera from final bleeds. Fig 1C shows an example of 125I-IbTX-D19Y/Y36F-labeled membranes precipitated with antibodies against BK channels (Alpha-18) and L-type Ca2+ channels (CNC1 and CND8). Precipitation performed with preimmune serum constituted less than 5% of control precipitation performed with final bleed antibodies. For the CNC1 antibody, where no preimmune serum was available, precipitation with second bleed antibodies constituted 18% of control values. These results indicate that the antibodies used are highly specific in immunoprecipitation assays. Immunoblotting—All antibodies applied in these experiments have proven highly specific in earlier studies (24Knaus H.G. Schwarzer C. Koch R.O. Eberhart A. Kaczorowski G.J. Glossmann H. Wunder F.

https://openalex.org/W2115959117,"We analyzed the transcriptional program elicited by stimulation of normal human fibroblasts with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) using cDNA microarrays. 103 significantly regulated transcripts that had not been previously linked to PDGF signaling were identified. Among them, a cluster of genes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis, including stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), fatty acid synthase, and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS), was up-regulated by PDGF after 24 h of treatment, and their expression correlated with increased membrane lipid production. These genes are known to be controlled by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP). PDGF increased the amount of mature SREBP-1 and regulated the promoters of SCD and HMGCS in an SREBP-dependent manner. In line with these results, blocking SREBP processing by addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol blunted the effects of PDGF on lipogenic enzymes. SREBP activation was dependent on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, as judged from the effects of the inhibitor LY294002 and mutation of the PDGFβ receptor tyrosines that bind the PI3K adaptor subunit p85. Fibroblast growth factors (FGF-2 and FGF-4) and other growth factors mimicked the effects of PDGF on NIH3T3 and human fibroblasts. In conclusion, our results suggest that growth factors induce membrane lipid synthesis via the activation SREBP and PI3K.

In conclusion, our results suggest that growth factors induce membrane lipid synthesis via the activation SREBP and PI3K. Growth factors stimulate cell division by promoting the transition from G0 to S in the cell cycle. One such factor, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), 1The abbreviations used are: PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; APRE, acute phase response element; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FAS, fatty acid synthase; FGF, fibroblast growth factors; HMGCR, hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase; HMGCS, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKB, protein kinase B; RPLP0, ribosomal protein, large, P0; SCD, stearoyl-CoA desaturase; SLC20A1, solute carrier family 20, member 1; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. was initially characterized as a potent mitogen for fibroblasts and other cells of mesenchymal origin (1Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar). PDGF consists of a family of dimeric ligands that are produced from four different genes, namely PDGF-A, -B, -C, and -D. They exert their cellular effects by binding to and dimerizing PDGF α- and/or β-receptors, which belong to the receptor-tyrosine kinase family (2Li X. Ponten A. Aase K. Karlsson L. Abramsson A. Uutela M. Bäckström G. Hellstrom M. Bostrom H. Li H. Soriano P. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Alitalo K. Östman A. Eriksson U. Nat.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The PDGF isoforms play important roles during embryonic development and in wound healing (1Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar, 4Betsholtz C. Karlsson L. Lindahl P. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 494-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In addition, an improper activation of PDGF receptors contributes to the development of fibrosis, atherosclerosis, and certain forms of cancer (1Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar). Growth factor receptors, including the PDGF receptors, use a common set of signal transduction cascades (5Heldin C.H. Östman A. Rönnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-113PubMed Google Scholar). One of the best characterized pathways involves the sequential activation of Ras, RAF, MEK, and the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase, which phosphorylates multiple substrates, many of which are transcription factors. A second important signaling event depends on the re-localization of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) to the plasma membrane, which leads to the production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and the activation of downstream effectors such as protein kinase B (PKB, also called Akt), and p70 S6 kinase (6Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). Both ERK and PI3K play essential roles in the mitogenic response to growth factors (1Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar, 7Jones S.M. Kazlauskas A. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2413-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, Jones and Kazlauskas (8Jones S.M. Kazlauskas A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) proposed that the G0 to S transition requires two waves of signaling; one that follows immediately after growth factor stimulation and is mediated by ERK and c-Myc, and a second wave that occurs about 8-h later and overlaps temporally with the cell cycle program (8Jones S.M. Kazlauskas A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). PI3K activation appeared to be essential during the second phase. Most studies have focused on the mechanism by which growth factors stimulate DNA synthesis and mitosis. Besides these essential aspects of the cell cycle, cell proliferation also requires the replication of all other cell constituents. It was recently suggested that this process is in part mediated by PI3K, which was shown to stimulate protein synthesis and to contribute to cell size increase (9Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of production of other cell constituents, such as membrane lipids, during proliferation are not well understood. Lipogenic enzymes are controlled at multiple levels, such as gene expression, protein stability, and enzymatic activity. One of the most important groups of transcription factors that govern the expression of these enzymes is constituted by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins, i.e. SREBP-1a, -1c, and -2 (10Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 11Edwards P.A. Ericsson J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 157-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). SREBP-1c differs from SREBP-1a only in the N terminus, which is encoded by an alternative exon 1 of the SREBP-1 gene. These factors are produced as precursor proteins embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane as a complex with the cholesterol sensor SCAP (10Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 12Rawson R.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). SCAP is required to escort SREBP in the Golgi apparatus, where two specific proteases, S1P/SKI-1 and S2P, cleave SREBP, releasing a soluble active transcription factor that up-regulates the expression of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis, as well as NADPH production (13Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3838) Google Scholar, 14Horton J.D. Shah N.A. Warrington J.A. Anderson N.N. Park S.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12027-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). In a negative feedback mechanism, cholesterol promotes the binding of SCAP to INSIG-1 and -2, which prevents SREBP movement to the Golgi and its processing (12Rawson R.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 15Yabe D. Komuro R. Liang G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3155-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Using mutant mammalian cell lines, Goldstein et al. (16Goldstein J.L. Rawson R.B. Brown M.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that several components of the SREBP pathway are required for long term proliferation, unless the cells are provided with key lipid metabolism products, such as oleic acid, cholesterol, and mevalonate (16Goldstein J.L. Rawson R.B. Brown M.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Whether SREBP is regulated during cell growth is, however, not known. In this report, we analyzed changes in gene expression in fibroblasts stimulated by PDGF, using cDNA microarrays. After 1–4 h of stimulation, we observed altered expression mainly of previously characterized immediate early genes (17Fambrough D. McClure K. Kazlauskas A. Lander E.S. Cell. 1999; 97: 727-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 18Tullai J.W. Schaffer M.E. Mullenbrock S. Kasif S. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20167-20177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Among the genes induced after longer periods of PDGF treatment were genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, which required the activation of SREBP transcription factors, and correlated with increased membrane lipid synthesis. This cascade of events was also triggered by other growth factors and was found to depend on the activation of the PI3K pathway. Cell Culture and Reagents—AG01518 foreskin fibroblasts (Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ) from passages 11–19 were cultured in modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and glutamine. For starvation and treatments, cells were washed and incubated in medium containing glutamine and 0.1% essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma). PDGF-BB was generously provided by Amgen. EGF, FGF-2, and FGF-4 were purchased from Peprotech (London, UK). HepG2 and NIH3T3 were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum or calf serum, respectively. NIH3T3 that stably express the EGF receptor were kindly provided by Katarzyna Kowanetz (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden). A rabbit antiserum raised against the CLARIKRTGDGNYKSG peptide, mapping at the C terminus of human SCD, was generated as described (19Demoulin J.B. Seo J.K. Ekman S. Grapengiesser E. Hellman U. Ronnstrand L. Heldin C.H. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). cDNA Microarray Analysis—Subconfluent AG01518 fibroblasts were starved for 16 h in the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and then stimulated for 1, 4, 10, or 24 h with PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml in starvation medium) or left untreated for the same periods of time. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The RNA quality was checked by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis (RNeasy protocol). Total RNA (40 μg) from cells treated for a given period of time with PDGF or starvation medium alone was labeled in reverse transcription reactions (Superscript II kit, Invitrogen) with dCTP-Cy5 and dCTP-Cy3, respectively (Amersham Biosciences). In every second replicate experiment the fluorescent deoxynucleotides were swapped. Purified cDNA probes labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 were mixed per pair and hybridized to cDNA microarray chips (hver1.2.1) from the Sanger Institute/LICR/CRUK consortium (see www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Microarrays/ for details and hybridization protocols). For each time point, we performed at least four independent hybridizations and used at least two different batches of RNA. Chips were scanned in a PerkinElmer/GSI Lumonics ScanArray 4000 scanner, and spot intensities were measured using the QuantArray software (histogram method with background subtraction). Normalization and statistical analysis of the quadruplicate data sets were performed using GeneSpring 5.0 analysis software (Silicon Genetics). A Lowess non-linear normalization was applied, and the median of the ratio distribution for each array was set to 1. Regulated spots were selected based on the average ratio values ≥1.750 for up-regulated genes and ≤0.571 for down-regulated genes. In addition, we considered only genes that were significantly regulated (Student's t test, p < 0.05) based on replicate hybridizations (global error model, GeneSpring). For all features selected using this protocol, the signal was significantly above the background, indicating that the expression of these genes was detectable. Finally, Hver1.2.1 microarrays contain replicate spots (1Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar, 2Li X. Ponten A. Aase K. Karlsson L.

Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar) corresponding to the same gene. Genes represented by spots that were not regulated in a similar manner were discarded. We show the average ratio of one representative spot for each regulated gene, with standard error calculated from multiple hybridizations and with the annotation provided by the microarray facility (Hver1.2.1_NCBI33). Quantitative Real Time PCR—These experiments were performed essentially as recommended by Applied Biosystems and described in a previous report (20Giandomenico V. Simonsson M. Gronroos E. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2587-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA was prepared from 5 μg of total RNA using the Superscript II kit and diluted with water to 100 μl. Quantitative real-time PCR experiments were performed with 2 μl of cDNA, SYBR green master mix (Applied Biosystems), and oligonucleotides designed using the PrimerExpress software, according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR reactions were run in triplicate on an ABI7000 sequence detection system. Quantitative data were calculated using a regression curve from serial dilutions of a standard cDNA, or the Ct method (for validated assays). Luciferase Experiments—Cells were seeded 1 day before in 12-well plates (50,000 cells per well). NIH3T3 were transfected using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen), and HepG2 with calcium phosphate precipitates, as described (20Giandomenico V. Simonsson M. Gronroos E. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2587-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The indicated promoters cloned in the pGL2 luciferase reporter (125 ng, Promega) were mixed with pDRIVE-chEF1-RU5′ (β-galactosidase reporter, Invitrogen, 125 ng) and pTKCIII as carrier DNA. Cells were washed, incubated in serum-free medium for 36 h, in the presence or absence of PDGF-BB (50 ng/ml), lysed, and processed as described (20Giandomenico V. Simonsson M. Gronroos E. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2587-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Data are presented as the average ratio between the luciferase activity and the β-galactosidase content, with standard deviations from duplicate transfections. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Lipid Synthesis Measurements—Subconfluent AG01518 fibroblasts were starved for 16 h, and treated with or without PDGF-BB (50 ng/ml) for 20 h. [1-14C]acetate (5 μCi, 1 μCi/ml) was then added, and incubation was prolonged for 4 h. Cells were washed, trypsinized, centrifuged, resuspended in PBS, and solubilized by addition of 20 volumes of chloroform/methanol 2:1. Four volumes of 0.9% NaCl were added to separate the two phases. The chloroform phase was dried under a nitrogen flux, and either used for total lipid determinations (see below), or hydrolyzed for 1 h at 80 °C in 1 ml of methanol containing 1 m KOH. Cholesterol and other neutral lipids were extracted with hexane. The lower phase was then neutralized and mixed with chloroform to extract fatty acids. Fractions were dried and analyzed by thin layer chromatography using silica gel 60 plates (Merck), which were developed with hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (87:20:1 vol), in the presence of standards (oleic acid, stearic acid, cholesterol, lanosterol, and squalene, all from Sigma). Unsaturated fatty acids were separated from saturated ones using plates impregnated with AgNO3, as described (21Dobson G. Christie W.W. Nikolova-Damyanova B. J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Appl. 1995; 671: 197-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was quantified using a FUJI phosphorimager, and standards were visualized in iodine vapors or by charring. The radioactivity of each fraction was also measured in a β counter. The analysis of nonhydrolyzed lipids was performed as described (22Touchstone J.C. J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Appl. 1995; 671: 169-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The initial chloroform extract was loaded on an aminopropyl column (Supelco). Neutral lipids were eluted with chloform/isopropyl alcohol (2:1) and phospholipids with methanol. Each fraction was dried and analyzed by thin layer chromatography. The plates were developed in chloroform/methanol (2:1) only to 2 cm from bottom edge, followed by development with chloroform/ethanol/triethylamine/water (30:34:30:8) for 4 cm, thoroughly dried, and then developed in hexane/diethyl ether (50:5). Spots were visualized as above, and identified by comparison with the following standards: phospholipid mix (Supelco), triolein, cholesterol oleate, cholesterol, lanosterol (all from Sigma). Total protein contents of the initial samples were measured using the BCA kit (Pierce) and used to normalize the results. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blots—Subconfluent AG01518 cells were starved as described above and stimulated with PDGF-BB for the indicated period of time. N-Acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (25 μg/ml, Calbiochem) was added to the medium 2 h before harvest (23Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.Y. Brown M.S.

Cells were washed, scraped in 2 ml of PBS, centrifuged, and lysed (1% Triton, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 140 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1% Trasylol, 1 mm NaF, 25 μmN-acetyl-leucyl-leucylnorleucinal). Lysates were homogenized by using a 20G syringe and cleared by centrifugation. SREBP-2 was immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of total proteins with 10 μg of 1D2 antibody and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitates or equal amounts of total protein extract were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting performed with anti-SREBP-1 or anti-SREBP-2 (clone 2A4 and 1D2, respectively), and re-probed with anti-α-actin antibodies as a control (Sigma). Regulation of Gene Expression by PDGF in Fibroblasts—In order to gain knowledge about gene regulation by PDGF, we performed microarray experiments with Hver1.2.1 chips, which were provided by the Sanger Institute Microarray facility, and contain 9932 single-stranded cDNAs. Human foreskin fibroblasts were starved in serum-free medium for 16 h, and then stimulated by PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml) for 1, 4, 10, or 24 h. Cells that were left untreated for the same period of time were used as control for each time point. RNA was extracted, and used as a template to synthesize cDNA in the presence of dCTP-Cy3 or dCTP-Cy5. These probes were used for competitive hybridization of microarrays, as described under “Materials and Methods.” We selected genes that were significantly regulated by PDGF-BB by at least 1.75-fold, at one or more time points. We found 127 genes that fulfilled these criteria, usually at only one time point. They included 24 that had previously been linked to PDGF signaling in various models. Notably, PDGF-AB elicited an almost identical transcriptional program (data not shown). To further validate our data, the expression of 18 genes was checked by Northern blotting and/or quantitative PCR. Overall, we found a close concordance between cDNA microarray data and PCR or Northern blot data, with the microarray analysis underestimating the amplitude of each specific gene response. Of the 127 genes regulated by PDGF-BB, 18 genes have no known cellular function, while the others could be classified into 12 clusters (Table I). Transcription factors constituted the most prominent class of genes regulated after 1 h of stimulation by PDGF and included well characterized proto-oncogenes such as c-Jun, JunB, and c-Myc. Several molecules involved in signaling were also up-regulated early, including the dual specificity phosphatases DUSP-1, -4, -5, and -6, which have been shown to inhibit ERK activation, in a negative feedback loop (24Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. Faseb. J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Stimulation of fibroblasts for 24 h affected the expression of genes connected with the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton, which might contribute to the effects of PDGF on connective tissue contraction. PDGF treatment also increased the expression of two phosphate transporters, SLC20A1 and SLC20A2, which may account for the old observation that growth factors stimulate phosphate uptake by fibroblasts (25Holmsen H. Male R. Rongved S. Langeland N. Lillehaug J. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 589-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The largest group comprised 28 genes connected to metabolism, including 17 genes implicated in the biosynthesis of fatty acids or cholesterol. Stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD), which catalyzes the transformation of saturated fatty acids into monounsaturated fatty acids, was the gene induced to the highest extent by PDGF after 24 h (8.0 ± 2.2-fold). It was also regulated by PDGF in NIH3T3 and AG01523 fibroblasts (data not shown). This cluster also included fatty acid synthase (FAS), hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase (HMGCS), and reductase (HMGCR). Altogether, our microarray data point to a major effect of PDGF on lipid biosynthesis pathways.Table IGene regulation by PDGF in AG01518 fibroblastsNameSynonyms/descriptionEnsembl

https://openalex.org/W1965071570,"A cytotoxic enterotoxin (Act) of Aeromonas hydrophila possesses several biological activities, induces an inflammatory response in the host, and causes apoptosis of murine macrophages. In this study, we utilized five target cell types (a murine macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7), bone marrow-derived transformed macrophages, murine peritoneal macrophages, and two human intestinal epithelial cell lines (T84 and HT-29)) to investigate the effect of Act on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and mechanisms leading to apoptosis. As demonstrated by immunoprecipitation/kinase assays or Western blot analysis, Act activated stress-associated p38, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in these cells. Act also induced phosphorylation of upstream MAPK factors (MAPK kinase 3/6 (MKK3/6), MKK4, and MAP/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1)) and downstream effectors (MAPK-activated protein kinase-2, activating transcription factor-2, and c-Jun). Act evoked cell membrane blebbing, caspase 3-cleavage, and activation of caspases 8 and 9 in these cells. In macrophages that do not express functional tumor necrosis factor receptors, apoptosis and caspase activities were significantly decreased. Immunoblotting of host whole cell lysates revealed Act-induced up-regulation of apoptosis-related proteins, including the mitochondrial proteins cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor. However, mitochondrial membrane depolarization was not detected in response to Act. Taken together, the data demonstrated for the first time Act-induced activation of MAPK signaling and classical caspase-associated apoptosis in macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells. Given the importance of MAPK pathways and apoptosis in inflammation-associated diseases, this study provided new insights into the mechanism of action of Act on host cells.

MEKs are themselves activated via phosphorylation by MEK kinases (MEKKs) or MAPK kinase kinases. There are four major MAPK cascades that lead to altered gene expression: ERK1/2, JNK, p38 kinase, and ERK5. ERK1 and ERK2 are activated via phosphorylation by MEK1 and MEK2, respectively (17Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3439) Google Scholar).The two MAPK pathways most frequently associated with immune responses are JNK and p38 kinases. The JNK signaling pathway is a stress-activated MAPK pathway involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis (18Otto I.M. Raabe T. Rennefahrt U.E. Bork P. Rapp U.R. Kerkhoff E. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 345-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The p38 MAPK signaling pathway is associated with cell growth, differentiation, and death, and is activated by a variety of cytokines, including interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (17Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3439) Google Scholar, 19Waetzig G.H. Seegert D. Rosenstiel P. Nikolaus S. Schreiber S. J.

Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3439) Google Scholar). The activation of p38 leads to the production of several cytokines, including IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8, as well as cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric-oxide synthase enzyme, and phosphorylation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (20Marie C.

The ERK5 pathway is the most recently described MAPK pathway and is primarily associated with response to stress (26Lee J.D. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). ERK5 is activated via MEK5, which is itself activated by MEKK3 (28Chao T.-H. Hayashi M. Tapping R.I. Kato Y. Lee J.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36035-36038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).In the current study, we investigated the effects of Act on MAPK signaling in RAW 264.7 cells, murine peritoneal macrophages, and human intestinal epithelial cells (T84 cells) to determine the role of MAPK signaling in host cells and ultimately dissect the definitive role of signaling molecules that lead to the disease state during Aeromonas infection.Because we previously demonstrated that Act caused apoptosis of RAW 264.7 murine macrophages (16Galindo C.L.

Chem. 2003; 278: 40198-40212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we also investigated mechanisms associated with Act-induced apoptosis in murine peritoneal (primary) macrophages, TNF receptor (TNFR) knockout (KO) murine bone marrow-derived and transformed macrophages (29Mukhopadhyay A. Suttles J. Stout R.D. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31906-31912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and human intestinal epithelial cells. Taken together, the data clearly demonstrated for the first time that Act-induced host cell signaling involves activation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK pathways. Furthermore, we delineated the mechanisms of apoptosis in Act-treated host cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—The murine macrophage (RAW 264.7) and human intestinal epithelial (T84 and HT-29) cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). WT, double KO murine bone marrow-derived and transformed macrophages (deficient in both TNFR-1 and TNFR-2), and TNFR1/TNFR2 single KO macrophages were graciously provided by Dr. Aggarwal (29Mukhopadhyay A. Suttles J. Stout R.D. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31906-31912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 and HT-29 cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) containing 4.5 g of glucose/liter, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics, penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). T84 cells were cultured similarly, but in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) and 5% fetal bovine serum. WT and TNFR KO macrophages were cultured in RPMI (Invitrogen) and 5% fetal bovine serum. For each experiment, 5 × 105 cells/ml were plated in 35-mm dishes and allowed to attach overnight. The medium was removed, and fresh medium containing the stimulant (6 ng/ml (unless otherwise stated) lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-free Act) was added (14Chopra A.K. Xu X. Ribardo D. Gonzalez M. Kuhl K. Peterson J.W. Houston C.W. Infect. Immunol. 2000; 68: 2808-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). After each time point, cells were lysed using 100 μl/well of 1× Cell Lysis Buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), sonicated twice for 15 s, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min.Peritoneal Macrophage Isolation—Adult 25–30 g Swiss Webster female mice (6–8 weeks old) were purchased from Taconic Farm (Germantown, CA). Mice were housed in the specific pathogen-free animal facility at the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, and given free access to food and water prior to experiments. A 1-ml solution of 3% thioglycolate was injected into the peritoneal cavity of mice to elicit macrophage migration into the cavity. Mice were allowed to rest for 4 days and then sacrificed by an overdose of isoflurane followed by cervical dislocation. A partial midline incision was made to remove the dermis and expose the parietal peritoneum lining. Peritoneal exudate cells were harvested by flushing the peritoneal cavity with 7 ml of RPMI medium (Invitrogen) using a 10-ml syringe fitted with a 21-gauge, 1½-inch needle. Extracted cells were counted, centrifuged, and plated at 1 × 108 cells in 35-mm tissue culture dishes containing RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were allowed to adhere for 1 h, and then non-adherent cells were washed from the cultures. Complete medium was added to the cultures and Act (12 or 20 ng/ml) was added. Cells were incubated for the appropriate times before being lysed for subsequent Western blot analysis.Western Blot Analysis—The antibody for β-tubulin was purchased from Santa Cruz Biochemical Corp. (Santa Cruz, CA). All other antibodies and Jurkat T cell control extracts were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, and Western blot analysis was performed by established procedures (30Rose J.M. Houston C.W. Kurosky A. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1170-1176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications according to specifications of the antibody manufacturer. Briefly, equal amounts of total protein were loaded and separated on SDS, 10% polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk and washed in 1× Tween (0.1%), Tris-buffered saline three times for 5 min each. Primary antibodies diluted 1:1000 in 5% milk or bovine serum albumin (prepared in 1× Tween (0.1%), Tris-buffered saline) were allowed to incubate overnight at 4 °C. After washing, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) was diluted 1:2000 in 5% milk and applied to membranes. Subsequently, membranes were washed and a chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL) was applied and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 5 min.Immunoprecipitation/Kinase Assay—Kinase assay kits for p38 and JNK were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, and the procedure was performed as described by the manufacturer. Whole cell lysates were incubated with immobilized phospho-p38 antibody or c-Jun fusion protein overnight at 4 °C. Following microcentrifugation and washing, the pellet was suspended in kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of ATF-2 fusion protein (for p38 kinase activity) or 100 μm ATP (for JNK activity) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated with SDS sample loading buffer and the samples subjected to Western blot analysis.Gel Shift Analysis—Gel shift assays were performed as previously described (14Chopra A.K. Xu X. Ribardo D. Gonzalez M. Kuhl K. Peterson J.W. Houston C.W. Infect. Immunol. 2000; 68: 2808-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 16Galindo C.L. Sha J. Ribardo D.A. Fadl A.A. Pillai L. Chopra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40198-40212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, consensus oligonucleotide for CCAAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBP-β) was labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer. Next DNA binding reaction mixtures were assembled. We used unlabeled AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide as a specific competitor, unlabeled AP-2 or SP-1 consensus oligonucleotides as nonspecific competitors (Promega), and nuclear extracts from specific time points after Act treatment of RAW cells. Nuclear extracts were prepared using NE-PER kit (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 10 min, followed by addition of 20,000 cpm of 32P-labeled transcription factor consensus oligonucleotide, and incubation at room temperature for 20 min. Subsequently, 1 μl of gel loading 10× buffer (Promega) was added to each reaction mixture and samples (5 to 20 μg) were loaded on a nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was pre-run in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer for 30 min at 100 V before loading the samples. After completion of the run, the gel was transferred to Whatman 3MM paper, dried at 80 °C for 5 h, and exposed to x-ray film overnight to 48 h.Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy—Cells (RAW 264.7 and T84) were grown in cover glass chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) and observed on a Zeiss 510 UV meta confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). To view membrane blebbing, Act was added (20 ng/ml), and images were taken every 30 s for 6 h. To examine mitochondrial membrane potential, Act-treated RAW 264.7 cells were stained with 10 μm MitoTracker red CM-H2XRos dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). All observations were made using a plan-neofluar ×40/0.85 objective lens with an electronic zoom of 2. The Nomarski differential interference contrast images were stored on an optical disk and analyzed with Zeiss LSM software.Electron Microscopy—Act-treated (20 ng/ml) RAW 264.7 cells were fixed with a mixture of 0.1% glutaraldehyde, 2.5% formaldehyde, 0.03% trinitrophenol, and 0.03% CaCl2 in 0.05 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3) (31Berryman M.A. Rodewald R.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), postfixed in 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, stained en bloc with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate, and embedded in Poly/Bed 812. Ultrathin sections were cut on a Reichert-Leica Ultracut S ultramicrotome and examined in a Philips 201 electron microscope at 60 kV.Caspase Activity Assay—Colorimetric activity assay kits were purchased from BioVision Inc. (Mountain View, CA), and caspase activity assays were performed as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, reaction mixtures were assembled as follows: 50–200 μg of protein (whole cell lysates from Act-treated RAW 264.7 cells or from TNFR-1 and -2 single and double KO macrophages), 50 μl of 2× reaction buffer (containing 10 mm dithiothreitol), and 5 μl of peptide substrate (N-acetyl-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-p-nitroaniline (LEHD-pNA) for caspase 9 assays, N-acetyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-p-nitroaniline (IETD-pNA) for caspase 8 assays, or N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-p-nitroanilide (DEVD-pNA) for caspase 3 assays). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1–2 h and then read at 405 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Whole cell lysates from camptothecin-treated Jurkat T cells (BioVision Inc.) were used as positive controls.Flow Cytometry—For detection of apoptosis, variously stimulated HT-29 cells (1 × 106) were stained with annexin V-conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) by using the annexin-V-FITC staining kit (BioVision Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, cells were suspended in 500 μl of annexin V binding buffer and incubated with 5 μl of annexin V and 5 μl of PI for 5 min at room temperature in the dark. At least 20,000 cells were acquired in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer using CellQuest 3.0.1 software (BD Biosciences). Percentages of cells undergoing apoptosis were determined by dual-color analysis. This staining allowed us to distinguish 3 subsets of cells: viable cells (annexin V negative and PI negative), early apoptotic cells (annexin V positive and PI negative), and late apoptotic or necrotic cells (annexin V positive and PI positive). Immediately after staining, the cells were analyzed on a flow cytometer using 488-nm excitation and a 525-nm band pass filter for FITC and a 620-nm filter for PI detection.For detection of mitochondrial membrane potential, variously stimulated RAW 264.7 cells (1 × 106) were stained for 10 min at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml of the mitochondrial membrane potential sensor dye, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolycarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) (Molecular Probes). JC-1 is a cationic dye that exhibits potential-dependent accumulation in mitochondria, indicated by a fluorescence emission shift from 530 to 585 nm. At normal mitochondrial potential, fluorescent JC-1 aggregates predominate (585 nm). However, as mitochondrial potential drops, the aggregates separate, and the fluorescent monomeric form (530 nm) predominates. JC-1-stained cells were analyzed for relative 585 (FL2) to 530 nm (FL1) fluorescence, as described above.Apoptotic Protein Screens—Whole lysate protein samples (350 μg) from Act-treated (20 ng/ml) RAW 264.7 cells were analyzed by Kinetworks™ KAPS-1.0 Apoptosis Screens (Kinexus Bioinformatics Corp., Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) as previously described (view the Kinexus website for details and publication links). The Kinetworks™ analysis involved resolution of a single lysate sample by SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting with panels of up to 3 primary antibodies per channel in a 20-lane Immunetics Multiblotter. The antibody mixtures were carefully selected to avoid overlapping cross-reactivity with target proteins. Normalized trace quantity units (CPM) were arbitrary based on the intensity of ECL fluorescence detection for target immunoreactive proteins recorded with a Fluor-S MultiImager and quantified using Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad).Isolation of Cytosolic and Mitochondrial Lysates—RAW 264.7 cells, treated with 20 ng/ml Act for 0, 2, 4, and 6 h, were washed with PBS and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were washed twice with PBS and suspended in ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 250 mm sucrose. Cells were subsequently incubated on ice for 15 min and then homogenized by 15 passages though a 22-gauge needle. Homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were centrifuged twice at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants (cytosolic fractions) were subsequently subjected to Western blot analysis. All of the experiments were performed at least in triplicate and representative data are presented.RESULTSAct Induces Phosphorylation/Activation of p38 Kinase in RAW 264.7 Cells, Murine Peritoneal Macrophages, and Human Intestinal Epithelial (T84) Cells—RAW 264.7 cells, thioglycolate-induced murine peritoneal macrophages, or T84 cells were treated with 6, 12, or 20 ng/ml of Act for various time points and whole cell lysates were subjected to electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells (100 ng/ml for 30 min) were used as a positive control in these experiments and other MAPK Western blot analyses. LPS has been shown to induce ERK, p38, and JNK pathways in RAW 264.7 cells (32Sanghera J.S. Weinstein S.L. Aluwalia M. Girn J. Pelech S.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4457-4465PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent blots were probed with antibodies specific for the phosphorylated form of p38 (p-p38) or total p38α. As shown in Fig. 1A, Act (6 ng/ml) induced an increase in a 43-kDa sized band, consistent with the phosphorylated form of p38, by 1 h. This increase was observed up to 8 h but disappeared by 12 h. Western blot analysis on samples from RAW 264.7 cells treated with a higher dose (12 ng/ml) of Act (for up to 8 h) resulted in similar results, with the earliest induction of p38 phosphorylation observed at 30 min (data not shown). Increased phosphorylation of p38 observed upon Act treatment was not because of an increase in the protein concentration of total p38, as evidenced by similarly sized bands for each time point when blots were probed with an antibody that recognized both the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of p38α (Fig. 1B). Act-treated murine peritoneal macrophages exhibited a similar pattern of p38 phosphorylation for both concentrations of Act that were used (12 and 20 ng/ml): Act induced phosphorylation of p38 by 1 h (Fig. 1C), but no increase was observed for total p38α (Fig. 1D). Likewise, p38 phosphorylation was observed for Act-treated (12 ng/ml) T84 cells by 1 h (Fig. 1E), with no increase in total protein concentration (Fig. 1F). Because no bands were observed for total p38α in T84 cells (data not shown), we used an antibody specific for p38δ (Fig. 1F). Antibodies for p-p38 recognized both phosphorylated isoforms (p38α and p38δ), but it is likely that the phosphorylated form observed at 1 h in T84 cells was not the p38α isoform.To demonstrate that increased phosphorylation of p38 in Act-treated cells was biologically significant, we examined p38 kinase activity in Act-treated RAW cells. Whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of p38, and kinase assays were performed using ATF-2, a known substrate of p38. The resulting reactions were then subjected to electrophoresis and the blots were probed with an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of ATF-2. As shown in Fig. 1G, a 70-kDa sized band consistent with phosphorylated ATF-2 was"

Vipp1 is closely related to the phage shock protein A (PspA), a bacterial protein induced under diverse stress conditions. Vipp1 proteins differ from PspA by an additional C-terminal domain that is required for Vipp1 function in thylakoid biogenesis. We show here that in Cyanobacteria, green algae, and vascular plants, Vipp1 is part of a high molecular mass complex. The complex is formed by multiple copies of Vipp1, and complex formation involves interaction of the central α-helical domain that is common to Vipp1 as well as to PspA proteins. In chloroplasts of vascular plants, the Vipp1 complex can be visualized by green fluorescent protein fusion in discrete locations at the inner envelope. Green fluorescent protein fusion analysis furthermore revealed that complex formation is important for proper positioning of Vipp1 at the inner envelope of chloroplasts.

Green fluorescent protein fusion analysis furthermore revealed that complex formation is important for proper positioning of Vipp1 at the inner envelope of chloroplasts. Oxygenic photosynthesis is a specific feature of Cyanobacteria and chloroplasts of plants and algae. Characteristic of oxygenic photosynthesis is a specialized membrane system, the thylakoids, on which the components of the photosynthetic machinery are located (1Vothknecht U.C. Westhoff P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Despite its importance in the process of oxygenic photosynthesis, very little is known about the origin of the thylakoid membrane system in the ancestry of present day Cyanobacteria. Furthermore, proteins and other factors that are involved in the formation and maintenance of the thylakoid membrane in either Cyanobacteria or chloroplasts are not well defined. We have shown recently that in Arabidopsis as well as in Synechocystis the Vipp1 1The abbreviations used are: Vipp1, vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; BN, blue native; BS3, bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DM, n-decyl-β-maltoside; EM, electron microscopic; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PspA, phage shock protein A; RFP, red fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: Vipp1, vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; BN, blue native; BS3, bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DM, n-decyl-β-maltoside; EM, electron microscopic; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PspA, phage shock protein A; RFP, red fluorescent protein. protein is essential for thylakoid biogenesis (2Kroll D. Meierhoff K. Bechtold N. Kinoshita M. Westphal S. Vothknecht U.C. Soll J. Westhoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4238-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 3Westphal S. Heins L. Soll J. Vothknecht U.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4243-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Δ-vipp1 mutants, in which the expression of the vipp1 gene is greatly reduced, have lost their ability to build up a thylakoid membrane system and to perform oxygenic photosynthesis (2Kroll D. Meierhoff K. Bechtold N. Kinoshita M. Westphal S. Vothknecht U.C. Soll J. Westhoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4238-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 3Westphal S. Heins L. Soll J. Vothknecht U.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4243-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Interestingly, disruption of the vipp1 gene in Arabidopsis also abolished chloroplast vesicle transport, which has an alleged function in thylakoid formation in the chloroplasts of higher plants (2Kroll D. Meierhoff K. Bechtold N. Kinoshita M. Westphal S. Vothknecht U.C. Soll J. Westhoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4238-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 4Westphal S. Soll J. Vothknecht U.C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Vipp1 is closely related to PspA, a bacterial protein that is induced under distinct stress conditions, i.e. invasion by filamentous phages, inhibition of lipid biosynthesis, secretion defects, or the saturation of the twin arginine pathway (5Brissette J.L. Weiner L. Ripmaster T.L. Model P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 6Bergler H. Abraham D. Aschauer H. Turnowsky F. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1937-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Jones S.E. Lloyd L.J. Tan K.K. Buck M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6707-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8DeLisa M.P. Lee P. Palmer T. Georgiou G. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). PspA and Vipp1 are distinguished by a C-terminal domain of about 20–30 amino acids which is present in all Vipp1 proteins but lacking in PspA (3Westphal S. Heins L. Soll J. Vothknecht U.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4243-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It is presumed that this C-terminal extension is important for the role of Vipp1 in thylakoid biogenesis. Most Cyanobacteria possess genes coding for both PspA and Vipp1. Chloroplasts seem to have retained solely Vipp1, indicating that the function of PspA is no longer required in this organelle. So far, the exact function of PspA and Vipp1 remains elusive. In bacteria, PspA is part of a larger operon encoding four more proteins, PspB–PspE. PspA is induced under a number of different stress conditions, and it is believed that the protein helps to sustain the proton motive force across the plasma membrane (5Brissette J.L. Weiner L. Ripmaster T.L. Model P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 6Bergler H. Abraham D. Aschauer H. Turnowsky F. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1937-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). PspA was furthermore shown to repress its own transcription by binding to the AAA-ATPase PspF, which subsequently binds to the pspa promoter (9Dworkin J. Jovanovic G. Model P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Elderkin S. Jones S. Schumacher J. Studholme D. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). PspA can associate with the plasma membrane by interaction with two membrane-bound members of the psp operon, PspB and PspC (11Adams H. Teertstra W. Demmers J. Boesten R. Tommassen J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A recent study by DeLisa and co-workers (8DeLisa M.P. Lee P. Palmer T. Georgiou G. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) suggests that one of the functions of PspA is the enhancement of protein translocation via the twin arginine pathway. They showed that blockage of the twin arginine translocon by overexpression of a substrate could be released by coexpression of PspA. In similar experiments, the coexpression of Vipp1 from Synechocystis had the same effect as PspA, indicating that under these conditions Vipp1 might be able to replace PspA. Our experiments in Synechocystis, on the other hand, indicated that the function of Vipp1 could not be replaced by PspA (3Westphal S. Heins L. Soll J. Vothknecht U.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4243-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Here we show that the Vipp1 protein of Cyanobacteria, green algae, and vascular plants is organized in a high molecular mass complex. The complex consists of several Vipp1 molecules and does not seem to comprise any additional proteins. In chloroplasts, the Vipp1 complex is found closely associated with the inner envelope membrane but not within the thylakoids. Complex formation requires the interaction of a central α-helical domain of the Vipp1 molecules which is also common to PspA proteins. It does not require the C-terminal domain that distinguishes Vipp1 from PspA. Cloning of GFP and RFP Fusion Constructs—Full-length and C-terminally truncated vipp1 from Arabidopsis thaliana were amplified by PCR using Arabidopsis cDNA as template. Primers V-forward (5′-ggactagtatggctctcaaagcttca-3′) and V-reverse (5′-cggggtacccaaagtcgttagctttc-3′) were used to obtain the full-length vipp1 PCR product; primers V-forward and Vm-reverse (5′-ggggtaccccaattctttcttcaag-3′) were used to amplify the N-terminal part of vipp1 (1–859 bp). The PCR products were cloned into pOL-LP vector, N-terminal to the coding sequence for GFP, thereby creating the plasmids pVipp1-GFP and pVipp1m-GFP (12Mollier P. Hoffmann B. Debast C. Small I. Curr. Genet. 2002; 40: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Vipp1Δα-helix-GFP was created by restriction of pVipp1-GFP with Eco72I at positions 475 bp and 637 bp followed by re-ligation of the plasmid. pVipp1-RFP was created by subcloning vipp1 into pOL-LP where the GFP sequence was replaced with RFP (12Mollier P. Hoffmann B. Debast C. Small I. Curr. Genet. 2002; 40: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Western Blotting Analysis—Proteins were separated by 3–13% blue native (BN)-PAGE and 12.5% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Protan, Schleicher & Schuell) following the supplier's instructions. Immunodecorations with α-Vipp1 were performed as described previously (3Westphal S. Heins L. Soll J. Vothknecht U.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4243-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). α-Vcterm antiserum was prepared against the C-terminal 42 amino acids of the pea Vipp1 protein. Base pairs 915–1041 of the vipp1 coding region were amplified by PCR with primers 5′-ggagagcttcctcctggaaga-3′ and 5′-ttaaagctcctttgatctttttct-3′. The PCR product was cloned into the pCR T7/NT-TOPO expression vector (Invitrogen) with an N-terminal His6 tag. Heterologously expressed protein was purified on a Ni-NTA Superflow column (Qiagen) under denaturing conditions following the manufacturer's instruction. Antisera were made by injection of purified protein into rabbit by Pineda antibody service. Cross-linking—Chloroplast inner envelope membranes from pea were purified according to the method of Keegstra and Yousif (13Keegstra K. Yousif A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 316-325Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar) modified by Waegemann and Soll (14Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1991; 1: 149-158Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Isolated inner envelope membranes were resuspended in 50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6, and cross-linked with 0.5 mm bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate (BS3) for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Proteins were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot analysis using α-Vipp1 and α-Vcterm antisera. Trypsin Digestion—Inner envelope membrane of pea and total Escherichia coli membranes were incubated with trypsin as indicated at 25 °C for 90 s in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes and 5 mm CaCl2. To stop the reaction, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added, and the samples were incubated for 10 min on ice. Proteins were subsequently separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using α-Vipp1, α-Vcterm, and α-PspA antisera. BN-PAGE—BN-PAGE separation was carried out on 3–13% gradient gels according to the method of Schägger and von Jagow (15Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis chloroplasts were isolated from 3–4-week-old plants, purified on 40–80% Percoll gradients, and washed with isolation medium (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, 0.33 m sorbitol, 14.3 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Chlorophyll concentrations were determined by the method of Arnon (16Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synechocystis membranes were isolated as described in Shukla et al. (17Shukla V.K. Stanbekova G.E. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Fractions corresponding to 50 μg of chlorophyll for chloroplasts and 10 μg of chlorophyll for Synechocystis were solubilized in 60 μl of buffer containing 750 mm aminocaproic acid, 50 mm BisTris, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm EDTA-Na2 and incubated for 3–5 min on ice. n-Decyl-β-maltoside (DM) was added to a final concentration of 1%, and samples were incubated on ice for 10–20 min. After a 10-min centrifugation at 4 °C and 21,000 × g the supernatant was collected and loading buffer (5% Serva Blue G, 750 mm aminocaproic acid) was added to 1/10th of the sample volume. Protein samples were separated by BN-PAGE in the first and SDS-PAGE in the second dimension. Transient Expression in Tobacco Protoplasts—Seedlings of Nicotiana tabacum cv. petite Havana were germinated on B5-modified medium (18Gamborg O.L. Murashige T. Thorpe T.A. Vasil I.K. In Vitro. 1976; 12: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and leaves of 3–4-week-old plants were used in all experiments. Protoplast isolation and transient transformation were performed as described previously (19Koop H.U. Steinmuller K. Wagner H. Rossler C. Eibl C. Sacher L. Planta. 1996; 199: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). pVipp1-GFP, pVipp1m-GFP, and pVipp1Δα-helix-GFP were used for single transformations at 50 μg of DNA/5 × 105 cells; for cotransformation, 25 μg of pVipp1-RFP and pVipp1m-GFP were used/5 × 105 cells. For subsequent BN-PAGE analysis, 2 × 106 protoplasts were transformed, collected, and resuspended in isolation medium (330 mm sorbitol, 20 mm MOPS, 13 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 0,02% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were lysed on ice for 30 min, and chloroplasts were isolated by filtering the suspension through 25-μm gauze. The chlorophyll concentration was estimated, and BN-PAGE separation was performed as described above. Cloning and Expression of His-tagged Vipp1—The vipp1 full-length sequence from Arabidopsis was amplified by PCR and cloned into the expression vector pGEX17 (Invitrogen) C-terminally to a His6 tag. The construct was verified by DNA sequencing. The protein was expressed by transformation of the construct into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)lysS and induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. 2 h after induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, and lysed by passage through a French pressure cell. For BN-PAGE analysis the suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6. DM was added to 1% of the total volume, and the suspension was incubated for 15–20 min on ice. The insoluble fraction was discarded after centrifugation (1 h, 15,000 × g), and the supernatant, representing the DM-solubilized fraction, was analyzed on BN-PAGE followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Size exclusion chromatography of Vipp1-His6 was performed under different conditions. First, E. coli cells overexpressing Vipp1-His6 were collected, resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 75 mm NaSCN), and lysed using a French pressure cell. The suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer supplemented with 1.1% CHAPS, 600 mm NaCl and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with agitation followed by a centrifugation for 1 h at 15,000 × g. The supernatant, containing solubilized proteins, was applied onto a Ni-NTA column in binding buffer (50 mm Hepes-HCl, pH 7.6, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 75 mm NaSCN, 0.05% CHAPS), and Vipp1-His6 was purified under native conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions with the exception that 75 mm NaSCN was added to washing and elution buffer. Eluted Vipp1 was centrifuged for 10 min at 21,000 × g and analyzed on Superose 6 HR 10/300 column. The column was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 75 mm NaSCN. The column was calibrated with the following molecular mass markers: blue dextran (2,000 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa). Size exclusion was performed at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions (0.25 ml) were collected and analyzed by Western blotting with α-Vipp1 antiserum. Second, E. coli cells overexpressing Vipp1-His6 cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, and lysed by passage through a French pressure cell. The suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, the pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 4 m urea, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4,10mm Hepes, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and incubated for approximately 20 min at room temperature with agitation. Nonsolubilized and aggregated protein was removed by centrifugation (10 min, 15,000 × g). After estimation of the protein concentration the supernatant was diluted 1:20 (v/v) in renaturation buffer (55 mm Tris, pH 8.2, 10.56 mm NaCl, 0.44 mm KCl, 0.055% polyethylene glycol 3350, 550 mm guanidine HCl, 1.1 mm EDTA, 440 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm DM) to yield a final concentration of 1 mg/ml protein and incubated for 14 h at 4 °C with rotating. The sample was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min to remove aggregated proteins, and the supernatant was dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 300 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, centrifuged again (21000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) before being applied to the Superose 6 HR 10/300 column. The column was equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl and calibrated as described above. Electron Microscopy—Samples were prepared for EM using the conventional negative staining procedure. Briefly, one drop of purified Vipp1 complex diluted 1:10 was placed onto a carbon-coated grid hydrophilyzed by charge glow. After 2 min the protein solution was removed, and the grid was dried on air. Grids spread with the Vipp1 complex were treated for 1 min with 1% uranyl acetate and 0.01% glucose in water, briefly rinsed with a drop of water, and then air dried. The samples were examined with a Zeiss EM 912 transmission electron microscope operated with the Omega energy filter in the zero-loss mode. Imaging—All fluorescence images were obtained by an epifluorescence microscope (polychrome IV System, Till Photonics, Munich, Germany) using GFP, fluorescein isothiocyanate, and rhodamine filter sets. Pictures were taken with a cooled IR CCD camera and visualized by the TILLvision 4.0 software. Cross-linking of Inner Envelope Vesicles from Pea—Inner envelope vesicles derived from pea chloroplasts were cross-linked with BS3, and proteins were subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE. Vipp1 protein was detected by Western blot analysis using an antibody raised against the full-length protein from pea (Fig. 1A). As shown previously, the monomeric Vipp1 can be detected as a band of 33 kDa, in accordance with its deduced molecular mass (2Kroll D. Meierhoff K. Bechtold N. Kinoshita M. Westphal S. Vothknecht U.C. Soll J. Westhoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4238-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 20Li H.M. Kaneko Y. Keegstra K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 4: 619-632Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A second band of about 35 kDa can be observed frequently after long exposure to reducing conditions and was identified previously as Vipp1 by protein sequencing (2Kroll D. Meierhoff K. Bechtold N. Kinoshita M. Westphal S. Vothknecht U.C. Soll J. Westhoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4238-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The chemical alteration that causes the difference in the running behavior is not known. Incubation of inner envelope vesicles with BS3 created several immunoreactive bands of higher molecular mass. A characteristic band pattern was observed repeatedly in all our experiments, indicating the formation of specific cross-link products (Fig. 1A). A band of about 66 kDa became visible early on during the cross-linking reaction, and it remained the most prominent immunoreactive band even after prolonged incubation with BS3. The reaction created two more immunoreactive bands of about 100 and well over 200 kDa. A similar pattern was observed with chloroplasts of other vascular plants and with a different cross-linker (data not shown) supporting the specificity of the cross-link reaction. These results were the first indication that Vipp1 is in close proximity to other proteins to which it can be cross-linked. The cross-linking pattern suggests that Vipp1 primarily forms a homodimer or that it interacts with a protein of a very similar molecular mass (Fig. 1A). From their size, the higher molecular mass products could well present tetramers and octamers of Vipp1. BN-PAGE Analysis of Cyanobacteria and Chloroplast Vipp1—To investigate a potential complex formation by Vipp1 we separated native protein complexes from Arabidopsis chloroplasts by BN-PAGE. Isolated chloroplasts were solubilized in 1% DM, and nonsolubilized proteins were removed by centrifugation. Under these conditions most of the proteins were found in the supernatant including about 90% of the Vipp1 protein as determined by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The solubilized proteins and protein complexes were subsequently separated by BN-PAGE in the first (Fig. 1B, upper panel) and SDS-PAGE in the second dimension. Western blot analysis of the second dimension revealed two distinct positions of the Vipp1 protein (Fig. 1B, lower panel). A minor part of Vipp1 was found slightly below the first green band, which contains the monomeric light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding protein and which corresponds to a size of about 66 kDa. This part of the Vipp1 protein is therefore most likely monomeric. The major part of Vipp1 was found clearly above the photosystem I complex corresponding to a size of more than 1,000 kDa, indicating that most of the Vipp1 is indeed present as a high molecular mass complex. Similar results were obtained for the Vipp1 protein from pea, tobacco, or Chlamydomonas (data not shown). Thus, the organization of Vipp1 in a high molecular mass complex seems common to vascular plants as well as green algae. We wanted to elucidate whether a similar organization of Vipp1 can be found in Cyanobacteria. Therefore, detergent-solubilized membrane proteins from Synechocystis were separated by BN-PAGE in the first (Fig. 1C, upper panel) and SDS-PAGE in the second dimension. The proteins were subsequently analyzed by Western blot with α-Vipp1 against the pea protein, which also recognizes Vipp1 from Synechocystis (Fig. 1C, lower panel). The immunoblot showed very little monomeric Vipp1 protein in Synechocystis, whereas most of the Vipp1 was present in complexes of similar sizes compared with higher plants. It was shown recently that PspA from E. coli forms a ring-like homomultimer of 1,023 kDa (21Hankamer B.D. Elderkin S.L. Buck M. Nield J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8862-8866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that a similar structure is also formed by Vipp1. BN-PAGE Analysis of Heterologously Expressed Vipp1—To elucidate whether the Vipp1 complex is homo-oligomeric, we analyzed the organization of full-length Vipp1 from Arabidopsis that was heterologously expressed in E. coli. Cells were disrupted, and the membrane fraction was recovered by centrifugation. The majority of the heterologously expressed Vipp1 protein was found in this fraction. The membrane fraction was subsequently treated with 1% DM, and solubilized proteins were separated by BN-PAGE and SDS-PAGE as before. Western blot analysis revealed that more than half of Vipp1 was present as monomeric protein (Fig. 2A). Nevertheless, a significant amount was found in a high molecular mass complex of approximately the same size as native Vipp1 from chloroplasts. These results indicated that heterologously expressed Vipp1 protein alone seems to be sufficient for complex formation, and no further chloroplast proteins are required for this process. Size Exclusion Chromatography of Heterologously Expressed Vipp1—To analyze further the nature of the Vipp1 complex we separated heterologously expressed Vipp1 protein by size exclusion chromatography. Part of heterologously expressed Vipp1 protein is soluble under conditions where nondenaturing detergents such as DM or CHAPS are used in the preparation. We purified this soluble fraction of Vipp1 by affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA under nondenaturing conditions. The eluate from Ni-NTA was nearly free from contamination by other proteins and was separated further by size exclusion chromatography on Superose 6 (Fig. 2B). The chromatogram displayed a major protein peak corresponding to a molecular mass of about 2,000 kDa. Western blot analysis identified Vipp1 in this high molecular mass peak (Fig. 2B), confirming the results from the BN-PAGE analysis. The behavior of the heterologously expressed Vipp1 protein during size exclusion is identical to Vipp1 purified from detergent-solubilized chloroplasts, providing confirmation that the heterologously expressed Vipp1 behaves like the native protein (data not shown). To obtain a larger quantity of purified Vipp1 for negative stain EM analysis, the protein was isolated from inclusion bodies under denaturing conditions and was subsequently renatured in a buffer that included guanidine-HCl, polyethylene glycol, and sucrose. Most of the Vipp1 protein was soluble after renaturation, and this fraction was then likewise analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2C). The chromatogram obtained from this fraction was very similar to the one from Vipp1 purified under nondenaturing conditions. The Vipp1 protein was again found predominantly in the peak corresponding to a molecular mass of approximately 2,000 kDa. Thus we concluded that the denaturing-renaturing process did not interfere with the ability of Vipp1 to form a high molecular mass complex, and the protein eluting in the peak fraction was used for EM studies. Analysis of Purified Vipp1 Complex by Negative Staining EM—The Vipp1 complex purified under nondenaturing conditions by size exclusion chromatography was analyzed by negative stain EM after treatment with uranyl acetate. Because of the limited amount of protein the sample yielded only very few particles (Fig. 2Da). To obtain more data on the Vipp1 particles, we analyzed Vipp1 complexes isolated under denaturing conditions, which had been renatured and subsequently purified by size exclusion (Fig. 2D, b and c). These samples yielded a much larger set of particles. Several different samples obtained from two separate purifications were analyzed to get an impression of the structure of the Vipp1 complex. The majority of singular particles appeared ring-shaped, with a darker area in the center (Fig. 2D, a, b, d, and e), and they were classified as top view onto the complex. Other particles appeared tilted by 90° in relation to the plane of the grid, representing a side view on the complex (Fig. 2D, b and g). These particles were often found in stacks of two or more. We assume that this stacking is most likely the result of a higher complex concentration in this sample. In some rare cases particles could be found which were tilted at a less than 90° angle (Fig. 2D, c and f). In these cases the hole in the middle of the complex became partially visible. To get a rough estimation of the size of the Vipp1 complex, the different dimensions of about 60 single particles were measured. Calculated from this measurements the Vipp1 complex has a width of about 400 Å and a height of about 140 Å. The hole in the middle is estimated to be about 120 Å. Trypsin Digestion of Inner Envelope Vesicles and Overexpressed Vipp1 Protein—We had observed previously that treatment of inner envelope vesicles with trypsin resulted in the formation of a 25-kDa proteolytic fragment of Vipp1 that remained fairly resistant to proteolysis (Fig. 3A, left panel). This fragment is about the same size as the Vipp1 protein without its C-terminal extension or as PspA from E. coli (Fig. 3A, right panel). We tested this assumption by raising an antibody against the last 42 amino acids of the pea Vipp1 protein (α-Vcterm). The antiserum recognized the full-length Vipp1 protein in untreated inner envelope. In contrast, the 25-kDa peptide that remained after trypsin digestion was not recognized by this antibody (Fig. 3A, center panel). Thus, it is indeed the Vipp1-specific C-terminal extension that is cleaved from the Vipp1 protein. These results are consistent with a hypothetical structure of the Vipp1 where the N-terminal PspA-like"

Monitoring EGFR phosphorylation was achieved by measuring translocation and binding of an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP)-labeled phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB) to enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP)-tagged EGFR using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy or sensitized emission measurements. To simplify dynamic phosphorylation pattern measurements in cells, FLAME, a ratiometric sensor containing both EGFR-ECFP and PTB-EYFP in one molecule, was designed and examined in COS7 cells. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment demonstrated rapid and reversible changes in the EYFP/ECFP fluorescence emission ratios, due to binding of the PTB domain to its consensus binding sites upon phosphorylation at the cell periphery, whereas perinuclear regions failed to respond to EGF but were responsive to tyrosine kinase inhibition. Long-term EGF treatment resulted in accumulation of dephosphorylated receptor in the perinuclear region due to active dephosphorylation occurring at intracellular sites. This indicates that the sensor closely approaches the true dynamics of tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Phosphatase inhibition by pervanadate resulted in an irreversible response in all cellular compartments. These data show that EGFR is under tonic phosphatase suppression maintaining the receptor in an unphosphorylated (silent) state and is dephosphorylated at endomembranes after ligand-mediated endocytosis.

Ligand-stimulated EGFR homo- and heterodimerizes and subsequently phosphorylates itself and other cytoplasmic substrates at tyrosine residues, thus activating an intracellular signaling cascade and finally resulting in a wide range of responses, such as cytoskeletal rearrangements, changes in gene expression, and increased cell proliferation (1Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5538) Google Scholar). Previous analysis of the phosphorylation/activation status of the EGFR using a number of biochemical approaches such as immunoprecipitation and/or immunoblotting has revealed the basic mechanisms of ligand-induced autophosphorylation. Moreover, cell-based assays using fluorescence lifetime measurements have yielded quantitative spatial information about EGFR phosphorylation in fixed cells (2Verveer P.J. Wouters F.S. Reynolds A.R. Bastiaens P.I. Science. 2000; 290: 1567-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, biochemical as well as fixed cell approaches generally fail to capture the dynamics of tyrosine kinase activation in a single cell.Therefore, the activity of EGFR has been elegantly monitored in live cells expressing genetically encoded ECFP- and EYFP-labeled ratiometric fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensors on downstream targets such as Ras (3Sawano A. Takayama S. Matsuda M. Miyawaki A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 245-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) or cytoplasmic substrates (4Ting A.Y. Kain K.H. Klemke R.L. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15003-15008Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The latter study specifically monitored the enzymatic activity of the EGFR tyrosine kinase toward soluble substrates in live cells. These studies successfully solved the above-mentioned problems but were focused on the analyses of substrate phosphorylation or Ras activation, representing later events in EGFR signaling.Obviously, autophosphorylation of EGFR, representing the first step of the signaling cascade, can be determined by measuring the translocation of signaling molecules that interact with phosphotyrosine residues on EGFR to the plasma membrane in response to EGF. We therefore coexpressed the phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB) domain of human Shc fused to EYFP and EGFR-ECFP in MCF7 cells. Stimulation with EGF caused translocation of the PTB domain to the plasma membrane. Determination of FRET to show direct binding of the PTB domain to EGFR was done by measuring the fluorescence lifetime of ECFP or the sensitized emission of EYFP.These quantitative FRET measurements are comparatively complex and involve a number of image processing/calculation steps. Moreover, these approaches require the coexpression of two constructs, the relative levels of which are difficult to control but have an influence on the dynamic range of the read out. To generate a sensor for EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation that can be imaged by a simple ratiometric approach, we fused the PTB-EYFP construct to EGFR-ECFP and thus created a monomolecular sensor, FLAME (fluorescent, linked autophosphorylation monitor for EGFR), representing a noninvasive approach to dynamically determine the phosphorylation state of the EGFR by intramolecular binding of the PTB domain to specific phosphotyrosine residues.Phosphatases clearly play an important role in controlling receptor tyrosine kinase activity at various levels. First, phosphatase activity confers tonic suppression on tyrosine kinases to prevent spontaneous autophosphorylation in the absence of ligand (5Reynolds A.R. Tischer C. Verveer P.J. Rocks O. Bastiaens P.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and thereby controls the phosphorylation levels. This is supported by the well-known observation that application of tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors, such as pervanadate, to cells induces ligand-independent, high tyrosine phosphorylation levels. A second function of phosphatases is receptor silencing after growth factor stimulation (signal termination). Because recent data indicate that EGFR activation/phosphorylation and signal termination by phosphatases occur at different sub-cellular localizations (6Haj F.G. Verveer P.J. Squire A. Neel B.G. Bastiaens P.I. Science. 2002; 295: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 7Burke P. Schooler K. Wiley H.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1897-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), we decided to use the newly generated sensor to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution of phosphorylated (activated) and dephosphorylated (inactivated) EGFR upon growth factor stimulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—MCF7 and COS7 cells were routinely cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU (μg)/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. For microscopy experiments, cells were transferred to low bicarbonate minimal essential medium without phenol red and riboflavin, supplemented with 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4).Preparation of Constructs—EGFR-ECFP was produced in the same manner as the previously described EGFR-EGFP. The citrine variant of EYFP (8Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) was used for all constructs, due to its low pKa and salt independence. PTB-EYFP was constructed in two steps. First, a flexible linker was inserted into pcDNA3.1-Citrine in front of citrine by annealing the following oligonucleotides 5′-CTAGCACCGGTTCTGGTGGGTCAGGAGGGGGCGGAGGTA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTACCTCCGCCCCCTCCTGACCCACCAGAACCGGTG-3′. Second, the PTB domain was inserted by amplification from human shc cDNA using Pfu Turbo (Stratagene) and the primers 5′-TTTCTAGACCATGGGCCAGCTTGGGGGCGA-3′ and 5′-TTACCGGTCCTGAGGTATTGTTTGAAGCGCAA-3′. The PCR product was digested with XbaI and AgeI and cloned into vector predigested with NheI and AgeI.The monomolecular sensor FLAME was produced by cloning a linker using annealed oligonucleotides (5′-GTACAAGAACGGCACCAGCGGCGGCAACAGCGGCGGCAACACGCGTAACGCGTGC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGCACGCGTTACGCGTGTTGCCGCCGCTGTTGCCGCCGCTGGTGCCGTTCTT-3′) into EGFR-ECFP digested with BsrGI and NotI. The resulting construct was redigested with MluI and XbaI and used as a vector to clone PTB-EYFP obtained by PCR from the above-described PTB-EYFP construct using the following primers: forward primer, 5′-TTTACGCGTACCATGGGCCAGCTTGGGGGCGAG-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-TAGAAGGCACAGTCGAGG-3′. PCR products were digested with MluI and XbaI and subcloned.Cell Transfection and Preparation for Imaging—Constructs were transiently transfected into MCF7 or COS7 cells using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, cells were microinjected with a mixture of plasmids encoding FLAME_F5 and EGFR at 1 ng/μl using an Inject-man/Femtojet system (Eppendorf). Cells were then serum-starved for 12 h before all experiments in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking fetal calf serum and antibiotics. A 250 mm pervanadate stock solution was prepared directly before use by mixing sodium orthovanadate and 30% hydrogen peroxide (approximately 10 m; Sigma) at a molar ratio of 2:1 and kept cold before application to cells. Stock solutions of human recombinant EGF (Promega) were prepared at 100 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). AG1478 (Calbiochem) was dissolved at 10 mm in DMSO and further diluted to 100 μm in PBS directly before use. A 25 mm stock solution of monensin (ethanol) was directly diluted to 25 μm in imaging medium.Microscopy—FLIM sequences were obtained at a modulation frequency of 80 MHz with an IX70 microscope (Olympus), using a 100×/1.4 NA oil objective. ECFP was excited using the 457.9-nm line of an argon ion laser. ECFP fluorescence was detected using a dichroic beam splitter (467; Delta) and a narrow-band emission filter (HQ 480/20; Chroma). The EYFP images were recorded using a 100-watt mercury arc lamp with a filter set (excite, HQ 515/20; dichroic, Q 530 LP; emitter, HQ 560/40).Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed on a TCS SP2 microscope (Leica) equipped with a 63×/1.4 NA oil immersion lens. For sensitized emission measurements, CFP and YFP were excited sequentially by using the 457.9- and 514-nm argon laser line, respectively. Fluorescence emission was detected at 460-495 nm (CFP channel) and 520-550 nm (YFP channel). Calculations of sensitized emission signals were performed as described previously (9Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 10Nagy P. Vamosi G. Bodnar A. Lockett S.J. Szollosi J. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, the total amount of light emitted by sensitized emission from EYFP was calculated. For quantitative evaluation, the total amount of light calculated as sensitized emission was normalized by division by EYFP fluorescence to generate an apparent FRET efficiency EAPP.Ratiometric imaging was done using an automated Axiovert 135 microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a 63×/1.4 NA oil immersion lens or a 40×/1.2 NA water immersion lens, two automatic filter wheels (Visitronsystems), and a Cool Snap HQ cooled charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics). Samples were illuminated by a 100-watt mercury arc lamp through a D436/10 excitation filter, a 90% neutral density filter, and a CFP/YFP/Cy5 triple-band beam splitter and imaged sequentially through 470/30 (CFP) and 535/30 (YFP) emission filters with the charge-coupled device camera set to 4 × 4 binning. Background values were calculated within a region of interest outside the cell. Ratios were calculated after background subtraction by pixel-wise divisions of the images in the YFP and CFP channels.Image Analysis—Image analysis was performed using the commercially available software IPLab (Scanalytics) and custom-designed software.Immunoblotting—Proteins were extracted using 50 mm Tris/Cl, 300 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied Science), and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate for 20 min on ice and separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and gels were equilibrated for 5 min in blotting buffer (20% methanol, 380 mm glycine, 50 mm Tris, and 0.1% SDS). Proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P; Millipore), which were then blocked for 1 h in 5% bovine serum albumin/PBS at room temperature, washed with PBS, and immunostained for 3 h at room temperature in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS containing primary antibody Py72 (anti-phosphotyrosine; 5 μg/ml; Cancer Research UK) or JL-8 (anti-GFP; 0.5 μg/ml; Clontech). Washed blots were labeled for 1 h with sheep anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences; diluted 1:20,000 in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBST (PBS) with 0.1% Tween 20), washed extensively in PBST, immersed in Western Lightning detection reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film.RESULTSPTB Domain Translocation by Binding to EGFR-ECFP—EGF-induced binding of the PTB domain to EGFR-ECFP (Fig. 2A) was analyzed by measuring FRET using fluorescence lifetime microscopy (11Wouters F.S. Bastiaens P.I. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1127-1130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). MCF7 cells were cotransfected with EGFR-ECFP and PTB-EYFP (see Fig. 1) and starved as described. Treatment with 100 ng/ml EGF resulted in a drop in the fluorescence lifetime of ECFP, indicating binding of the PTB domain to the activated receptor. This drop in lifetime was fully reversed when EYFP was bleached by intense illumination at 515 ± 10 nm, indicating that the observed lifetime drop was due to FRET.Fig. 2Translocation and binding of soluble PTB domain to EGFR-ECFP in MCF7 cells. A, fluorescence lifetime imaging data showing the fluorescence images of PTB-EYFP and EGFR-ECFP and the fluorescence lifetime maps of ECFP calculated before EGF treatment (first row), after 18 min of EGF (100 ng/ml) treatment (second row), and after photodestruction of EYFP (third row). Lifetimes (in ns) were calculated independently as described from the phase shift (Tau_Phase) and the demodulation (Tau_Mod).

Potential PTB domain binding sites are highlighted in red (Tyr1086 and Tyr1148); an additional PTB domain binding site (Tyr1114) is highlighted in light red because this site does not represent a major autophosphorylation site. In the FLAME_F5 constructs, all major autophosphorylation sites were knocked out by replacing tyrosine residues with phenylalanine residues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Confocal microscopy (Fig. 2B) demonstrated the EGF-induced rapid translocation of the PTB domain to the plasma membrane. Moreover, sensitized emission measurements were carried out as described previously (9Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 10Nagy P. Vamosi G. Bodnar A. Lockett S.J. Szollosi J. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) to observe FRET at confocal resolution. The addition of 100 ng/ml EGF resulted in complete translocation and maximal sensitized emission after 30 s. Quantitation of the sensitized emission demonstrated that a maximum of 150% of the starting signal was reached after EGF treatment (Fig. 2C), whereas the EYFP fluorescence emission (dashed line) remained constant. The subsequent addition of 100 nm AG1478, an EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor (12Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar), 2 min after EGF stimulation resulted in a gradual reversion of the PTB domain translocation, which was complete 2.5 min after AG1478 addition. These data indicate that EGF induces binding of the PTB domain to EGFR-ECFP, which can be slowly reversed by inhibition of EGFR kinase activity.Intramolecular Recognition of Phosphorylation in FLAME—A ratiometric sensor, FLAME, was designed as outlined in Fig. 1 to monitor EGFR phosphorylation by intramolecular binding of the linked PTB domain to its consensus binding sites present in the tail of EGFR upon phosphorylation. FLAME has several advantages for measuring phosphorylation of EGFR compared with translocation experiments as indicated above. First, the physical link between the PTB domain and EGFR renders the interaction of PTB-EYFP with EGFR-ECFP independent of long-range diffusion, such that PTB domain binding kinetics should more closely approach that of EGFR phosphorylation. Second, the relative amounts of ECFP and EYFP are constant throughout the cell when FLAME is expressed, enabling the recording of EYFP/ECFP emission ratios as a direct measurement of changes in FRET. Finally, the stoichiometry of binding between EGFR and the PTB domain is constant in FLAME, whereas binding of several PTB domains to one EGFR could occur during coexpression of PTB-EYFP and EGFR-ECFP.Biochemical characterization of FLAME was performed by immunoblotting as shown in Fig. 3. Transfected COS7 cells were lysed, and protein (10 μg/lane) was loaded and immunostained with a GFP antibody recognizing all spectral variants or the Py72 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Immunoblotting confirmed that both FLAME and FLAME_F5 were expressed at the correct size and became tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to EGF (100 ng/ml, 2 min). It should be noted that FLAME_F5 showed a very low basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation but still became phosphorylated upon EGF stimulation. This is due to the fact that EGFR contains more than five tyrosine residues that become phosphorylated upon growth factor stimulation (13Soler C. Beguinot L. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12320-12324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two of these five major autophosphorylation sites correspond to the consensus-binding site of the PTB domain (Tyr1086 and Tyr1148), thus allowing specific interaction. A third potential binding site at Tyr1114 is still present in FLAME_F5 (see Fig. 1) but represents a minor phosphorylation site and was shown not to contribute to the observed ratio changes (see below).Fig. 3Immunoblot analysis of FLAME after expression and EGF stimulation (2 min) in COS7 cells. T, transfection; FL, FLAME; F5, FLAME_F5; GFP, blot with anti-GFP antibody (recognizing all variants); pY, anti-phosphotyrosine antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4A demonstrates that FLAME expressed in COS7 cells reversibly measures EGFR autophosphorylation. Transfected COS7 cells were observed by ratiometric imaging using 436/10 nm excitation. Recombinant human EGF (100 ng/ml) was added at the indicated time points, and YFP/CFP emission ratios were recorded. After 2 min of EGF stimulation, the EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 (100 nm) was added, which resulted in rapid and complete reversion of the ratio changes even beyond the initial values. These data indicate that PTPs are able to access and dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine residues in the EGFR-PTB domain complex, resulting in rapid reversibility. Furthermore, Fig. 4A demonstrates that in the absence of ligand, EGFR has basal phosphorylation levels that can be reduced by inhibition of its tyrosine kinase activity. Quantitation of four regions, as indicated in the images, demonstrated that EGF-induced ratio changes were more pronounced at the periphery (i.e. close to the membrane) of the cell than in the perinuclear regions, yielding maximal ratio changes of 5% and 8%, whereas the perinuclear regions hardly responded to EGF treatment and yielded ratio changes of ∼2%. The S.D. within the regions of interest was 2% for all four regions (Fig. 4C).Fig. 4Ratiometric imaging of COS7 cells after EGF stimulation. A, COS7 cells expressing FLAME were stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF. EYFP/ECFP ratios are presented. B, COS7 cells expressing the mutant version FLAME_F5 were treated as described in A.

Beguinot L. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12320-12324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) residues resulted in an inactive sensor termed FLAME_F5, as shown in Fig. 4B, indicating that the observed ratiometric changes in FLAME are due to binding of the PTB domain to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the receptor, phospho-Tyr1086 and/or phospho-Tyr1148 (14Zhou M.M. Harlan J.E. Wade W.S. Crosby S. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31119-31123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these findings indicate that the potential PTB binding site at Tyr1114 (a minor phosphorylation site of EGFR) does not contribute to the observed FRET response.Phosphatase inhibition by treatment with 1 mm pervanadate (Fig. 5) resulted in a rapid drop of the YFP/CFP ratio, which was stable even after the subsequent addition of AG1478 for another 60 s. Irreversibility arises from the absence PTP activity, which could dephosphorylate the receptor in the cell. Furthermore, quantitation of four regions of interest (two on the periphery and two in the perinuclear region) yielded irreversible ratio changes in a similar range for both peripheral and perinuclear regions, indicating that pervanadate treatment, in contrast to growth factor treatment, induces full phosphorylation of EGFR on all membrane compartments in the cell.Fig. 5Ratiometric imaging of COS7 cells after pervanadate (1 mm) stimulation followed by treatment with 100 nm AG1478.

FLAME-expressing COS7 cells were subjected to either single treatments with AG1478, EGF, or pervandadate (2 min) or two consecutive treatments using the same compounds (2-min treatment with the first compound, followed by an additional 2-min treatment with the second compound) and lysed, and protein (10 μg/lane) was loaded and immunostained with the Py72 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, stripped, and reprobed with GFP antibody.Fig. 6 demonstrates that EGF induced a 2.5-fold increase in phosphotyrosine levels, whereas AG1478 reduced the band intensity to ∼50%. Pervanadate resulted in a very strong induction of phosphorylation (>5-fold). However, consecutive treatment of the cells with EGF and AG1478 did not result in increased phosphorylation compared with control, whereas consecutive application of pervanadate and AG1478 resulted in a strong induction of tyrosine phosphorylation relative to control. These data again suggest that EGF induces reversible phosphorylation, whereas pervanadate, by inhibiting phosphatases, leads to a very strong and irreversible phosphorylation of the receptor, and these results are in good accordance with those obtained by ratiometric imaging (Figs. 3 and 4).Fig. 6Immunoblot analysis of FLAME in COS7 cells after consecutive stimulations. 1., first treatment; 2., second treatment; -, no treatment; E, EGF (100 ng/ml, 2 min); A, AG1478 (100 nm, 2 min); P, pervanadate (1 mm, 2 min). pY/GFP, relative band intensities after reprobing with GFP antibody relative to control (first lane).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Moreover, we assessed whether FLAME responds to changes in tyrosine phosphorylation following an intra- or intermolecular mechanism. The latter could occur by binding of the linked PTB domain to phosphorylated consensus binding sites present on proteins in the vicinity of FLAME, e.g. as a result of homodimerization (representing a well-described mechanism in EGFR signaling). This is important to establish because an intermolecular binding mechanism would depend on local FLAME concentration differences within different compartments in addition to phosphorylation, thus complicating the interpretation of results, whereas an intramolecular mechanism would be concentration-independent. To achieve this aim, we coexpressed FLAME_F5 with EGFR by microinjecting equal amounts of both plasmids and performed ratiometric imaging (Fig. 7). Quantitative image analysis was performed by subtracting the relative ratio (R/R0) after EGF treatment (last frame of EGF exposure) from the relative ratio after AG1478 addition (first frame after addition) obtained in EGF-treated COS7 cells within peripheral regions to evaluate the maximal dynamic range in the ratio changes. Even in the presence of coexpressed EGFR, FLAME_F5 expression did not yield any ratiometric response, in contrast to expression of FLAME. These data indicate that FLAME responds to phosphorylation via an intramolecular binding mechanism and therefore does not require dimerization for its activity.Fig. 7Intra-versus intermolecular binding of the PTB domain in FLAME. COS7 cells expressing FLAME, FLAME_F5, or FLAME_F5 and EGFR after EGF and AG1478 treatment. Quantitation of the total relative response was performed by calculating the differences between the relative ratios after EGF and AG1478 treatment within individual cells on ≥5 cells for each condition. Average FLAME response, 4.5 ± 1.4% (n = 8); average FLAME_F5 response, -0.7 ± 0.7% (n = 5); average FLAME_F5/EGFR (equal amounts) response, 0 ± 1.2% (n = 15).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation was followed for a longer period to observe dephosphorylation of the receptor by endogenous PTPs. To obtain more rapid internalization of the receptors upon EGF treatment, these experiments were performed in the presence of 25 μm monensin, which blocks EGFR recycling (15Pennock S. Wang Z. Mol.

Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Nectin-like molecules (Necls) have been named for a group of Ig-like molecules whose domain structures are similar to, but slightly different from, those of nectins (9Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Nectins are Ca2+-independent Ig-like cell-cell adhesion molecules that constitute a family of four members, nectin-1, -2, -3, and -4 (for reviews, see Refs. 9Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar and 10Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Nectins form cis-dimers followed by formation of trans-dimers (trans-interaction), eventually causing cell-cell adhesion. Nectins first form cell-cell adhesion where cadherins are recruited, resulting in formation of adherens junctions in epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Nectins are associated with the actin cytoskeleton through afadin, a nectin- and actin filamentbinding protein, as cadherins are associated with the actin cytoskeleton through α- and β-catenins (for a review, see Ref. 11Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). Necl-5 is one member of the Necl family consisting of five members, Necl-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5 (9Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Although they have domain structures similar to those of nectins, they do not directly bind afadin.Nectin-3 forms not only homo-trans-dimers but also hetero-trans-dimers (heterophilic trans-interaction) with either nectin-1 or -2 (9Takai Y.

These hetero-trans-dimers show much higher cell-cell adhesion activity than the homo-trans-dimers. In contrast to nectins, Necl-5 does not show homophilic cell-cell adhesion activity (12Aoki J.

We have moreover found that Necl-5 is up-regulated in NIH3T3 cells transformed by an oncogenic Ras (V12Ras-NIH3T3 cells) (13Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Itoh S. Shingai T. Takekuni K. Satoh K. Inoue Y.

Kakunaga S. Takekuni K. Shingai T. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Imai T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18015-18025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and enhances serum- and platelet-derivedgrowthfactor(PDGF)-inducedcellmotilityinanintegrin-dependent manner, when Necl-5 does not trans-interact with nectin-3 (15Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Takekuni K. Shingai T. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Imai T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18015-18025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Studies on the mechanisms of the cell migrating activity of Necl-5 have revealed that the extracellular region of Necl-5 is necessary for directional cell migration, but not for random cell motility. The cytoplasmic region is necessary for both random cell motility and directional cell migration. Necl-5 enhances the serum-induced activation of Cdc42 and Rac, causing formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, respectively, which are necessary for cell motility. The cytoplasmic region of human Necl-5 binds Tctex-1, a subunit of the dynein motor complex (16Mueller S. Cao X. Welker R. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7897-7904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), which may also be involved in the regulation of cell motility in cooperation with microtubules. Thus, Necl-5 plays key roles not only in poliovirus infection but also in cell motility and is likely to be responsible for enhanced motility of transformed cells. Transformed cells generally show not only enhanced cell motility but also enhanced cell proliferation. We have therefore examined here whether Necl-5 is furthermore involved in regulation of cell proliferation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction—Expression vectors were constructed in pCAGIZeo (17Niwa H.

Fatty acid-free BSA and insulin were purchased from Sigma. Human recombinant PDGF-BB and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-basic were purchased from PEPROTECH.Quantification of Necl-5 by Flow Cytometry—For flow cytometry of endogenous Necl-5, the cells were detached with 5 mm EDTA and phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in FACS buffer (1% BSA, 0.02% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline), and incubated with the anti-Necl-5-mAb-i or control rat IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) in FACS buffer. After being washed, the cells were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG pAb (Chemicon).

The plating efficiencies of NIH3T3, Swiss3T3, and MEF cells were about 80, 40, and 50%, respectively. After 4 h, the cells were washed with DMEM and starved of serum with DMEM containing 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA for 24 or 48 h. After the serum starvation, the quiescent cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% serum in the presence or absence of 100 μg/ml anti-Necl-5 mAb-s or DMEM containing 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA, 20 ng/ml PDGF or 10 ng/ml FGF, and 10 μg/ml insulin.

After being washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were harvested with prewarmed Laemmli buffer (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) and boiled for 5 min. Protein concentrations of the samples were determined by an RC DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with BSA as a reference protein. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar), followed by Western blotting using the various Abs and ECL plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences).Assay for Activation of Ras—The GTP-bound form of Ras was detected by the pull-down method as described previously (22Guo F.F.

Kakunaga S. Takekuni K. Shingai T. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Imai T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18015-18025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We first obtained NIH3T3 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged Necl-5-ΔCP (Necl-5-ΔCP-NIH3T3 cells) and Zeocin-resistant NIH3T3 cells (Zeo-NIH3T3 cells) as an empty vector control. FLAG-tagged Necl-5-ΔCP was indeed expressed in Necl-5-ΔCP-NIH3T3 cells as estimated by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). Necl-5-ΔCP-NIH3T3, Zeo-NIH3T3, and wild-type NIH3T3 cells were starved of serum for 24 h and then cultured in the presence of serum. The cells continued to proliferate until they became confluent. The growth rate of Zeo-NIH3T3 cells was similar to that of wild-type NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2A). However, the growth rate of Necl-5-ΔCP-NIH3T3 cells was much slower than that of Zeo-NIH3T3 and wild-type NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore, the density of Necl-5-ΔCP-NIH3T3 cells at confluence was far less than that of Zeo-NIH3T3 and wild-type NIH3T3 cells. We have shown previously that one of the anti-Necl-5 mAbs, the anti-Necl-5 mAb-s, stimulates the cell motility enhancing activity of Necl-5 (15Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Takekuni K. Shingai T. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Imai T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18015-18025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We then examined the effect of this mAb on the proliferation of wild-type NIH3T3 cells. The growth rate was faster in the presence of the mAb than in the absence of the mAb (Fig. 2A). The cell density at confluence was higher in the presence of the mAb than in the absence of the mAb. Furthermore, we obtained NIH3T3 cells inducibly expressing FLAG-tagged Necl-5-ΔCP by use of the Tet-Off system (Tet-Off-Necl-5-ΔCP-NIH3T3 cells) (Fig. 1B). The growth rate of Tet-Off-NIH3T3 cells, which were the parental cells of Tet-Off-Necl-5-ΔCP-NIH3T3 cells, was similar to that of wild-type NIH3T3 cells in the presence or absence of doxycycline (Fig. 2, A and B). When FLAG-tagged Necl-5-ΔCP was inducibly expressed in the absence of doxycycline, the growth rate of Tet-Off-Necl-5-ΔCP-NIH3T3 cells was much slower than that of Tet-Off-NIH3T3 and wild-type NIH3T3 cells. When the expression of FLAG-tagged Necl-5-ΔCP was suppressed by doxycycline, the growth rate of Tet-Off-Necl-5-ΔCP-NIH3T3 cells became faster than that in the absence of doxycycline (Fig. 2B). However, this growth rate was slower than that of Tet-Off-NIH3T3 and wild-type NIH3T3 cells because of the expression of FLAG-tagged Necl-5-ΔCP to a small extent which was not completely suppressed by doxycycline (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results indicate that Necl-5 is involved in the regulation of proliferation of NIH3T3 cells.Fig. 2Growth curves of NIH3T3, Swiss3T3, and MEF cells. The cells were seeded, starved of serum, and cultured in the presence of 10% serum. The cell numbers were counted at each indicated time.

The time course starts at the time of culture in the presence of serum. The results are the means ± S.E. of the five independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We further confirmed by use of other cell lines that Necl-5 is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. Necl-5 was undetected by Western blotting in Swiss3T3 and MEF cells (data not shown), but it was expressed in these cell lines as estimated by flow cytometry (Fig. 1Ca). Therefore, we obtained Swiss3T3 and MEF cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged Necl-5-ΔCP (Necl-5-ΔCP-Swiss3T3 and Necl-5-ΔCP-MEF cells, respectively). FLAG-tagged Necl-5-ΔCP was indeed expressed in these cell lines as estimated by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). FLAG-tagged Necl-5-ΔCP and the anti-Necl-5 mAb-s showed the essentially similar inhibitory and stimulatory effects, respectively, on the proliferation of Swiss3T3 and MEF cells, although the extents of the inhibitory and stimulatory effects were slightly different among the three cell lines used (Fig. 2, C and D). These results indicate that Necl-5 is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation.Shortening the period of the G0/G1 Phase of the Cell Cycle by Necl-5—We next investigated using NIH3T3 cells how Necl-5 enhanced cell proliferation. We first performed flow cytometry to clarify which phase of the cell cycle is enhanced by Necl-5. Necl-5-ΔCP-NIH3T3 and wild-type NIH3T3 cells were starved of serum for 24 h and then cultured in the presence of serum for 18 h. During the 18 h, the number of cells in the G0/G1 phase was decreased less markedly in Necl-5-ΔCP-NIH3T3 cells than in wild-type NIH3T3 cells, and conversely the number of cells in the S phase was increased less markedly in Necl-5-ΔCP-NIH3T3 cells than in wild-type NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3A, a and b). It took 15 h for the progression of the G0/G1 phase to the S phase of wild-type NIH3T3 cells, whereas it took 21 h for that of Necl-5-ΔCP-NIH3T3 (data not shown). The number of wild-type NIH3T3 cells in the G0/G1 phase was decreased more markedly in the presence of the anti-Necl-5 mAb-s than in the absence of the mAb, and conversely the number of wild-type NIH3T3 cells in the S phase was increased more markedly in the presence of the mAb than in the absence of the mAb (Fig. 3Aa). These results, essentially similar to those obtained for wild-type NIH3T3 cells, were obtained for Zeo-NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). These results indicate that Necl-5 shortens the time of the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle.Fig. 3Cell cycle analysis of NIH3T3 cells by flow cytometry. NIH3T3 or Necl-5-ΔCP-NIH3T3 cells were seeded, starved of serum, and cultured in the presence of 10% serum or 20 ng/ml PDGF and 10 μg/ml insulin. The cells were analyzed by a FACSort and Cell Quest software. A, culture in the presence of serum. a, NIH3T3 cells; and b, Necl-5-ΔCP-NIH3T3 cells.

Cyclin D is first up-regulated followed by down-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 and up-regulation of cyclin E in this order at the G1 phase in NIH3T3 cells (25Uren A.

We then examined the expression levels of these cell cycle regulators in Necl-5-ΔCP-NIH3T3 and wild-type NIH3T3 cells by Western blotting.

In contrast, p27Kip1 was less down-regulated in Necl-5-ΔCP-NIH3T3 cells than in wild-type NIH3T3 cells, whereas it was more down-regulated in the presence of the anti-Necl-5-mAb-s than in the absence of the mAb in wild-type NIH3T3 cells.

https://openalex.org/W1964421631,"Dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPPIV or CD26) is a homodimeric type II membrane glycoprotein in which the two monomers are subdivided into a β-propeller domain and an α/β-hydrolase domain. As dipeptidase, DPPIV modulates the activity of various biologically important peptides and, in addition, DPPIV acts as a receptor for adenosine deaminase (ADA), thereby mediating co-stimulatory signals in T-lymphocytes. The 3.0-Å resolution crystal structure of the complex formed between human DPPIV and bovine ADA presented here shows that each β-propeller domain of the DPPIV dimer binds one ADA. At the binding interface, two hydrophobic loops protruding from the β-propeller domain of DPPIV interact with two hydrophilic and heavily charged α-helices of ADA, giving rise to the highest percentage of charged residues involved in a protein-protein contact reported thus far. Additionally, four glycosides linked to Asn229 of DPPIV bind to ADA. In the crystal structure of porcine DPPIV, the observed tetramer formation was suggested to mediate epithelial and lymphocyte cell-cell adhesion. ADA binding to DPPIV could regulate this adhesion, as it would abolish tetramerization.

EC 3.4.14.5) is a ubiquitous, multifunctional integral type II membrane glycoprotein located on the surface of a variety of epithelial, endothelial, and lymphoid cells, and it also occurs in soluble form in serum. As serine exopeptidase, DPPIV cleaves N-terminal dipeptides from polypeptides with proline or alanine preferentially in the penultimate position, thereby regulating the activity of a variety of biologically important peptides (1Mentlein R. Regul. Pept. 1999; 85: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Besides its peptidase activity, one of the main functions of DPPIV is binding to adenosine deaminase (ADA, EC 3.5.4.4) and to the extracellular matrix (2Hanski C. Huhle T. Gossrau R. Reutter W. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 178: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). All of these functions can influence T-cell proliferation (3Gorrell M.D. Gysbers V. McCaughan G.W. Scand. J.

In addition, DPPIV interacts with human immunodeficiency virus-1 Tat protein (5Gutheil W.G. Subramanyam M. Flentke G.R. Sanford D.G. Munoz E. Huber B.T. Bachovchin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The six-residue-long N-terminal cytoplasmic tails of the DPPIV dimer are followed by 22-residue-long transmembrane α-helices. The subsequent extracellular ectodomains are divided into two domains each. Eight-bladed β-propeller domains (Arg54-Asn497) form the arms of the “U” distal to the membrane plane, and α/β-hydrolase domains (Gln508-Pro766) proximal to the membrane form the bend of the “U” and harbor the catalytic triads that are required for peptidase activity. Soluble DPPIV (without transmembrane α-helix) migrates as a dimer in gel filtration (3Gorrell M.D. Gysbers V. McCaughan G.W. Scand. J. Immunol. 2001; 54: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) but can also form higher molecular weight assemblies with apparent mass of 900 kDa (10Lambeir A.M. Diaz Pereira J.F. Chacon P. Vermeulen G. Heremans K. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J. De Meester I. Scharpe S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1340: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This could be due to a tetrameric assembly as observed in the crystal structure of porcine DPPIV (pDPPIV) that is associated with head-to-head binding between the ends of the arms of two “U” -shaped DPPIV dimers to form a “⊂ ⊃” -shaped complex. Engel et al. (9Engel M. Hoffmann T. Wagner L. Wermann M. Heiser U. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Bode W. Demuth H.U. Brandstetter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5063-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) suggested that pDPPIV tetramerization might be involved in cell-cell contacts, and this view would explain why DPPIV promotes adhesion between lymphocytes and epithelial cells that is inhibited by the addition of exogenous ADA (11Gines S. Marino M. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Morimoto C. Callebaut C. Hovanessian A. Casado V. Lluis C. Franco R. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 203-209PubMed Google Scholar). ADA is a ubiquitous, soluble, and globular enzyme with a TIM barrel fold (eight parallel β-strands forming a barrel decorated by α-helices) (12Wilson D.K. Rudolph F.B. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). It is present in all mammalian tissues and involved in the development and function of lymphoid tissue. ADA binds specifically to the DPPIV of humans, cattle, and rabbits with dissociation constants of 3 to 20 nm depending on the organism (3Gorrell M.D. Gysbers V. McCaughan G.W. Scand. J. Immunol. 2001; 54: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Binding of ADA to DPPIV is important in regulating the extracellular local concentration of adenosine (13Kameoka J. Tanaka T. Nojima Y. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. Science. 1993; 261: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 14Schrader W.P. West C.A. Miczek A.D. Norton E.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19312-19318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of ADA reduces signals mediated by CD3 and T-cell receptors and suggests a correlation between ADA binding to DPPIV and T-cell activation (15Martin M. Huguet J. Centelles J.J. Franco R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4630-4643PubMed Google Scholar), as elevated adenosine concentration inhibits the proliferation of T-lymphocytes. Although they share high sequence homology with their higher mammal analogs, DPPIV and ADA of rodents do not form a complex. A cryo-electron microscopy study of the DPPIV·ADA complex at 22 Å resolution confirmed the location of the ADA binding site on the β-propeller domain of DPPIV (16Ludwig K. Fan H. Dobers J. Berger M. Reutter W. Bottcher C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because details of intermolecular interactions remained elusive at this low resolution, ADA was oriented relative to DPPIV on the basis of mutagenesis studies, which suggested that helix α2 of ADA binds to segments of β-propeller blades IV and V of DPPIV (17Dong R.P. Tachibana K. Hegen M. Munakata Y. Cho D. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6070-6076PubMed Google Scholar, 18Abbott C.A. McCaughan G.W. Levy M.T. Church W.B. Gorrell M.D. Eur. J.

We crystallized the complex of human DPPIV (hDPPIV) ectodomain with bovine ADA (bADA), which shares 91% amino acid sequence homology with human ADA (hADA). The crystal structure determined at 3.0 Å resolution shows the intermolecular contacts in a highly amphiphilic interface that contribute to and stabilize hDPPIV·bADA complex formation. Production, Purification, and Crystallization of hDPPIV·bADA—Full-length, enzymatically active hDPPIV was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified (20Dobers J. Zimmermann-Kordmann M. Leddermann M. Schewe T. Reutter W. Fan H. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing showed that residues 1-29 were uniformly truncated during purification. The hDPPIV·bADA complex was prepared by mixing hDPPIV and bADA (Sigma type VIII from calf intestinal mucosa) with a molar excess of bADA in 20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and incubating at 4 °C overnight. The formed complex was analyzed by gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions (20Dobers J. Zimmermann-Kordmann M. Leddermann M. Schewe T. Reutter W. Fan H. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), purified by gel filtration on Superdex 200 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 (16Ludwig K. Fan H. Dobers J. Berger M. Reutter W. Bottcher C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and concentrated to 7 mg/ml. For crystallization, a reduced factorial screen (Hampton Research) was set up using the vapor diffusion method. Crystals were obtained with 20-22% polyethylene glycol 3350, 200 mm NaCl, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and optimized by microseeding. Prior to data collection, the crystals were soaked in 25% polyethylene glycol 3350, 200 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, supplemented with 20% glycerol, and cryo-cooled. Diffraction quality improved by annealing the crystal to room temperature twice for 3 s. Structure Determination—X-ray data were collected at BESSY II, Berlin, Germany (Beamline BL1 of Free University, Berlin) and processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Macromolecular Crystallography Part A. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar); see Table I. The structure of hDPPIV·bADA was solved by a molecular replacement method with the program MOLREP (22Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar) using glycoside-depleted hDPPIV as a partial search model (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1N1M), yielding two DPPIV dimers per asymmetric unit. Difference electron density clearly showed the presence of ADA molecules. Although an additional search using bADA (PDB code 1KRM) located four bADA molecules, the asymmetric unit is occupied by two (hDPPIV·bADA)2 complexes. Refinement was done using the REFMAC5 program (23Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) by applying four-fold noncrystallographic symmetry restraints to the protein chains but omitting the interface regions (24P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Manual model building was done with the program O (25Jones T.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1978; 11: 268-272Crossref Google Scholar). Glycoside residues could be fitted to the electron density at eight of the expected nine N-glycosylation sites except for Asn685.

Open table in a new tab Overall Structure—hDPPIV was expressed and purified as full-length protein, but N-terminal sequencing revealed that it was cleaved during purification after residue 29, explaining its solubility in detergent-free buffer. The final electron density map of hDPPIV·bADA featured no density for the N-terminal residues 30-38 presumably because of high flexibility and/or disorder of this segment. Ser39 is the first residue with appropriate electron density of the hDPPIV ectodomain. The crystal asymmetric unit contains two complexes, each with (hDPPIV·bADA)2 stoichiometry and a molar mass of 275 kDa (Fig. 1A). Each hDPPIV binds one bADA at the periphery of the β-propeller domain near the ends of the arms of the “U” (Fig. 1B), thereby preserving the pseudo-two-fold symmetry of the complex (Fig. 1A). All crystal contacts of (hDPPIV:bADA)2 are distant to the interface region, suggesting that they will not structurally influence the binding of hDPPIV to bADA. Superposition of main chain structures of hDPPIV (PDB code 1N1M) and bADA (PDB code 1KRM) with their equivalents in (hDPPIV·bADA)2 yielded average root mean square deviations of 0.8 and 0.9 Å, respectively, indicating that their structures are nearly identical. In particular, the interface regions of hDPPIV and bADA do not rearrange significantly upon complex formation and show root mean square deviations of 1.0 and 0.6 Å, respectively, for main chain atoms. In the (hDPPIV·bADA)2 complex, bADA does not block the possible path of substrate through the central tunnel of the β-propeller or through the side opening to the active site of hDPPIV (Fig. 1), and conversely, binding of hDPPIV (Fig. 1B) does not block the active site of bADA. This agrees with studies indicating that upon complex formation, DPPIV and ADA remain catalytically active (28De Meester I. Vanham G. Kestens L. Vanhoof G. Bosmans E. Gigase P. Scharpe S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The hDPPIV·bADA Interface—The hDPPIV:bADA interface buries 930-Å2 solvent-accessible surface area/polypeptide corresponding to 3 and 7% of the total accessible surface of individual hDPPIV and bADA molecules, respectively. Four glycoside residues linked to the conserved Asn229 of hDPPIV are well defined in the electron density (Fig. 2). They contact 33Arg-Arg-Gly-Ile36 of bADA and form one intermolecular hydrogen bond, and the protein-sugar interactions increase the buried surface by 170 Å2. This contact, however, is not a prerequisite for ADA binding as shown by site-directed mutagenesis of Asn229 → Ala or deletion of any other N-glycosylation site (29Aertgeerts K. Ye S. Shi L. Prasad S.G. Witmer D. Chi E. Sang B.C. Wijnands R.A. Webb D.R. Swanson R.V. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). hDPPIV binds bADA with two adjacent loops. Loop A (Ile287-Asp297) connects blades IV and V, and loop B (Asp331-Gln344) links β-strands β3 and β4 of blade V (Fig. 3). The loops protrude from the propeller blades and form a cleft accommodating helix α2 (Pro126-Asp143) of bADA (Fig. 4A). Interactions between helix α1 (Arg76-Ala91) of bADA and loop A of hDPPIV complete the interface (Fig. 4). As indicated in Fig. 3 by triangles, 14 and 13 residues in hDPPIV and bADA, respectively, are engaged in intermolecular contacts at the binding interface (see Fig. 4B). The supplementary information provides all interfacial contacts shorter than 3.9 Å.Fig. 4The interface between bADA and hDPPIV.A, stereo plot of the hDPPIV·bADA interface, with bADA segments in green and hDPPIV segments in gray.

Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4434) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A total of 11 intermolecular hydrogen bonds are formed between hDPPIV and bADA (Fig. 4). bADA-Glu139 on helix α2 appears to be important, as the carboxylate oxygen Oϵ1 forms hydrogen bonds to loop A of hDPPIV involving hDPPIVAla291NH, hDPPIV-Ser292NH, and hDPPIV-Ser292Oγ. In addition, bADA-Glu139Oϵ2 is hydrogen-bonded to hDPPIV-Gln344Nϵ on loop B, and hDPPIV-Gln344Oϵ is in contact with bADA-Arg142Nη on helix α2. The array of 11 hydrogen bonds with one hydrogen bond per 169 Å2 of buried surface is in close agreement to the average value of 10 hydrogen bonds per protein-protein interface and one hydrogen bond per 170 Å2 of buried interface area (30Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). The interface in the hDPPIV·bADA complex is strongly amphiphilic. Of the 14 residues of hDPPIV forming intermolecular contacts at the interface, seven are apolar, six neutral polar, and only one (Arg336) is charged (Figs. 3, 4B, and 5). This agrees grossly with the average distribution of residues in protein-protein interfaces, which comprise 57% apolar, 24% neutral polar, and 19% charged residues (30Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). By contrast, all of the 13 residues forming the interface region of bADA are polar, and among these, 9 (69%) are charged (see Fig. 5). The charged residues of bADA form two intramolecular and one intermolecular salt bridges (bADA-Arg76···bADA-Glu128, bADA·Arg142···bADA-Asp143), and (bADA-Asp127···hDPPIVArg336, respectively), and the other charged residues of bADA form hydrogen bonds to hDPPIV (Fig. 4). The highly charged interface region of bADA is unusual. Of all 27 residues participating in complex formation at the hDPPIV·bADA interface, 10 (37%) are charged, which is the highest percentage ever observed in protein·protein complexes, with the next highest value being 27% (30Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). As the sequences of human and bovine ADA are identical at the binding interface (Fig. 3), except for the conservative substitution hADA-Glu77/bADA-Asp77 that forms a hydrogen bond to hDPPIV-Gln286Nϵ (Fig. 4), structures of hDPPIV in complex with bovine and human ADA are supposed to be nearly identical. Binding Studies Are Consistent with the (hDPPIV·bADA)2 Structure—ADA from mouse and rat does not bind to endogenous DPPIV but binds weakly (in the μm range) to the DPPIV of primates, cattle, and rabbits. Although this lack of complex formation in rodents might be associated with amino acid substitutions in loops A and B of DPPIV and in helix α2 of ADA (Fig. 3), it has inspired mutational, binding, and kinetic studies on complex formation between DPPIV (18Abbott C.A. McCaughan G.W. Levy M.T. Church W.B. Gorrell M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 798-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and ADA (31Richard E. Alam S.M. Arredondo-Vega F.X. Patel D.D. Hershfield M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19720-19726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For wild type (WT) hADA nearly all residues on helix α2 were substituted, and the binding of the variants to WT rabbit DPPIV (rDPPIV) was studied in terms of dissociation constants (KD) and binding kinetics (kon, koff) (19Richard E. Arredondo-Vega F.X. Santisteban I. Kelly S.J. Patel D.D. Hershfield M.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1223-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The affinity of the complex between WT hADA and rDPPIV (KD = 17 nm) is ∼300× stronger than between WT murine ADA (mADA) and rDPPIV (KD = 5,400 nm). Compared with WT hADA, the most significant effects of single point mutations performed on helix α2 of hADA were found with Glu139 → Ala, Arg142 → Ala, and Asp143 → Ala, which showed an ∼10- to 8-fold decrease in binding affinity to rDPPIV, with KD between 160 and 112 nm (31Richard E. Alam S.M. Arredondo-Vega F.X. Patel D.D. Hershfield M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19720-19726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In all cases, the kinetic constants for complex formation (kon) were comparable (kon ∼2 × 104m-1 s-1) and similar to that for WT hADA and rDPPIV, whereas those for complex dissociation differed by one power (koff ∼2-4 × 10-3 s-1) compared with WT hADA, (koff ∼4 × 10-4 s-1. Such behavior (nearly constant kon but differing koff in point-mutated protein complexes) suggests important contributions by hydrophobic interactions (32Murrell-Lagnado R.D. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 977-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which, besides the salt bridges and hydrogen bonds detailed above, must add considerably to hDPPIV·bADA binding. This agrees with the finding that the (hDPPIV·bADA)2 complex dissociates at low ionic strength, suggesting that hydrophobic amino acids are essential for binding (33Tsai C.J. Lin S.L. Wolfson H.J. Nussinov R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). As interfacial residues of mADA and hADA differ solely in positions 142 and 143 on helix α2 (Fig. 3), a chimeric mADA construct containing the human α2 helix (residues 126-143) would be expected to bind to rDPPIV in a similar manner as WT hADA. The expected complex, however, showed a ∼35-fold reduced KD of 591 nm compared with ∼17 nm for rDPPIV·hADA. This is not due to conformational changes of α2, as superimposed backbone atoms of helices α1 and α2 of free mADA (PDB code 2ADA) with (hDPPIV·bADA)2 yielded a root mean square deviation of 0.53 Å. Although this is not significant at the 3.0-Å resolution level, the differences in dissociation constants may be due to other substitutions in mADA compared with hADA. The (hDPPIV:bADA)2 model shows that two nonconserved residues in the binding region of bADA, Gln175 and Ser131, are located at ∼5 Å to Asn338 of hDPPIV and exchanged for charged Lys175 and Asp131 in mADA. This change could lead to far reaching electrostatic effects, thereby reducing the binding affinity in the complex formed by rDPPIV and chimeric mADA. hDPPIV binds with a hydrophobic surface to ADA (Fig. 5). Compared with rodent DPPIV, which does not bind to endogenous ADA, four residues in the ADA binding site of hDPPIV are not conserved in any of the two rodent sequences, as depicted in Fig. 3. These are the bulky and hydrophobic residues Leu294, Ile295, and Val341 in hDPPIV that are all replaced by Thr in rat and by Ala294, Arg295, and Thr341 in mouse DPPIV, respectively. The positively charged Arg336 in hDPPIV is replaced by Val336 and Thr336 in rat and mouse, respectively. The significance of Leu294 or Val341 for ADA binding affinity was shown by mutational and subsequent binding studies, which indicated that mutations Leu294 → Ala or Val341 → Ala in hDPPIV reduced binding affinity to bADA, and drastic replacements Leu294 → Arg and Val341 → Lys even abolished bADA binding. The mutation Ile295 → Ser showed no detectable effect (18Abbott C.A. McCaughan G.W. Levy M.T. Church W.B. Gorrell M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 798-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), probably because Ile295 is located at the outer interface region (Figs. 4 and 5). The introduction of these three bulky hydrophobic residues in hDPPIV increases the hydrophobicity of the interface (Fig. 5). This may indicate a directional shift to the evolution of strong ADA binding affinity to DPPIV in higher mammals contrasted to the loss of binding in rodents as proposed by Abbott et al. (18Abbott C.A. McCaughan G.W. Levy M.T. Church W.B. Gorrell M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 798-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The fourth nonconserved residue in the ADA binding site of hDPPIV is Arg336, which is replaced for Val and Thr in rat and mouse DPPIV, respectively (Fig. 3). Arg336, the only charged residue in the hDPPIV interface, forms a salt bridge to bADAAsp127 (see Figs. 4 and 5) and might therefore improve binding affinity. ADA Binding Would Interfere with Tetramer Formation of DPPIV—Because the (hDPPIV·bADA)2 complex does not show significant structural changes compared with the isolated components hDPPIV and bADA, and their enzymatic activities are not affected (28De Meester I. Vanham G. Kestens L. Vanhoof G. Bosmans E. Gigase P. Scharpe S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), any modulation of a DPPIV-mediated signal transduction across the membrane that is induced by ADA binding may consequently be associated with yet unidentified sterical interference. In this context, porcine DPPIV is of interest because it shares 88% amino acid sequence identity with hDPPIV and crystallized as a tetramer forming a “⊂ ⊃” -shaped complex (9Engel M. Hoffmann T. Wagner L. Wermann M. Heiser U. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Bode W. Demuth H.U. Brandstetter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5063-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This is associated with the four β-strands Asn279-Gln286 that form two antiparallel β-sheets, thus extending the propeller blades IV to two eight-stranded β-sheets, and the dimer-dimer interactions are augmented by the outer β-strands of blades V (9Engel M. Hoffmann T. Wagner L. Wermann M. Heiser U. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Bode W. Demuth H.U. Brandstetter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5063-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). These segments (indicated by violet arrows in Fig. 1) share a homologous sequence in hDPPIV (Fig. 3), and although Gln286 is engaged in bADA binding (Fig. 4B), tetramer formation of DPPIV and binding of ADA are mutually exclusive. With this view, a recent study is explained that shows that hDPPIV promotes adhesion of lymphocytes to human epithelial cells, and that adhesion is significantly reduced by incubation with exogenous ADA (11Gines S. Marino M. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Morimoto C. Callebaut C. Hovanessian A. Casado V. Lluis C. Franco R. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 203-209PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that ADA could regulate cell-cell adhesion mediated by DPPIV, although no evidence has yet been provided that DPPIV directly participates in cell-cell adhesion. The proposed key role of the glycosylation state of Asn279 in preventing or enabling ADA binding (9Engel M. Hoffmann T. Wagner L. Wermann M. Heiser U. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Bode W. Demuth H.U. Brandstetter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5063-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), however, can be ruled out. This is because (hDPPIV·bADA)2 shows electron density for two N-acetylglucosamine residues attached to each Asn281 (corresponding to Asn279 in the porcine sequence) at an ∼15 Å distance to the bADA surface (indicated by an asterisk in Fig. 1B), which is too far to directly interfere with ADA binding.

https://openalex.org/W2093406710,"Glucosylceramide synthase (GlcT-1) catalyzes the formation of glucosylceramide (GlcCer), the core structure of major glycosphingolipids (GSLs), from ceramide and UDP-glucose. Ceramide and its metabolites, such as sphingosine-1-phosphate, are now known to be important mediators of apoptosis and cell survival. Recently, we have shown that GlcT-1 functions to regulate intracellular ceramide levels via glycosylation of ceramide. In this study, we employ the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model system for understanding the in vivo roles of GlcT-1. We isolated and characterized a GlcT-1 homologue (DGlcT-1) from Drosophila. When DGlcT-1 was expressed in GM-95 cells deficient in GSLs (because of the absence of GlcT-1 activity), these cells regained the ability to synthesize GSLs. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses revealed that the expression of DGlcT-1 mRNA was ubiquitous throughout development, suggesting that DGlcT-1 is important for development and differentiation. Indeed, RNA interference experiments demonstrated that the loss of GlcT-1 function enhances apoptotic cell death. Conversely, targeted expression of GlcT-1 partially rescued cell death caused by the proapoptotic factors Reaper and Grim, suggesting that ceramide generation might be one signal pathway that executes the cell death program. We also found that GlcT-1 localized not only in the Golgi apparatus but also in the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum, providing the first visual evidence of GlcT-1 in membranes. These results indicate that GlcT-1 might down-regulate ceramide generated in these membranes. Glucosylceramide synthase (GlcT-1) catalyzes the formation of glucosylceramide (GlcCer), the core structure of major glycosphingolipids (GSLs), from ceramide and UDP-glucose. Ceramide and its metabolites, such as sphingosine-1-phosphate, are now known to be important mediators of apoptosis and cell survival. Recently, we have shown that GlcT-1 functions to regulate intracellular ceramide levels via glycosylation of ceramide. In this study, we employ the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model system for understanding the in vivo roles of GlcT-1. We isolated and characterized a GlcT-1 homologue (DGlcT-1) from Drosophila. When DGlcT-1 was expressed in GM-95 cells deficient in GSLs (because of the absence of GlcT-1 activity), these cells regained the ability to synthesize GSLs.

These results indicate that GlcT-1 might down-regulate ceramide generated in these membranes. Ceramide and its metabolites, such as sphingosine-1-phosphate, have emerged as novel second messengers for intracellular signaling pathways that are involved in regulation of diverse cellular responses to exogenous stimuli (1Mathias S. Pena L.A. Kolesnick R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 2Kolesnick R.N. Kronke M. Annu. Rev.

Its mechanisms of action and the regulation of its production have focused particular attention since ceramide has been shown to be an intracellular effector in apoptosis (4Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar, 5Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). However, the role of ceramide in apoptosis has been the subject of some controversy. Whether ceramide generation precedes induction of apoptosis or is subsequent to the commitment process is uncertain (6Pronk G.J. Ramer K. Amiri P. Williams L.T. Science. 1996; 271: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Very recently, Acharya et al. (7Acharya U. Patel S. Koundakjian E. Nagashima K. Han X. Acharya J.K. Science. 2003; 299: 1740-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) have shown that retinal degeneration caused by light-dependent photoreceptor cell death involves ceramide generation. It remains unclear, however, where ceramide is formed in the visual system. Moreover, what ceramide targets and its mode of action also are unknown. Importantly, cell death in this system is completely rescued by the introduction of ceramidase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes ceramide to sphingosine and fatty acid. Glucosylceramide synthase (GlcT-1, 1The abbreviations used are: GlcT-1, ceramide glucosyltransferase; GSL, glycosphingolipid; GlcCer, glucosylceramide; GM3, sialyllactosylceramide; C6-NBD-Cer, 6-{[(N-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) amino] caproyl}sphingosine; SM, sphingomyelin; SMase, sphingomyelinase; GMR, glass multimer promoter; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; ds, double stranded; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; TM, transmembrane. EC 2.4.1.80) catalyzes the transfer of glucose (Glc) from UDP-Glc to ceramide (Cer) to form glucosylceramide (GlcCer). We propose that GlcT-1 has dual functions. First, GlcT-1 can act as a negative regulator of ceramide-mediated reactions by modifying ceramide with glucose. GlcT-1-mediated glycosylation of ceramide reduces intracellular ceramide level and protects cells from apoptosis (8Bourteele S. Hausser A. Doppler H. Horn-Muller J. Ropke C. Schwarzmann G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1140-1146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Second, GlcT-1 can catalyze the synthesis of GlcCer, the core structure of major glycosphingolipids (GSLs). GSLs form lipid microdomains (e.g. rafts of the plasma membrane) that have been implicated in various important cellular processes, such as differentiation, adhesion, proliferation, and cell-cell recognition (12Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4984) Google Scholar, 13Hakomori S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 14Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2551) Google Scholar). Thus, GlcT-1 plays significant roles in a variety of biological processes by regulating both intracellular ceramide levels and the overall synthesis of GSLs. We have previously cloned cDNAs of human GlcT-1 (HGlcT-1, UGCG) (15Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12654Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and mouse GlcT-1 (MGlcT-1) (16Ichikawa S. Ozawa K. Hirabayashi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). GlcT-1 is a type III membrane protein. Its catalytic domain is located at the cytosolic surface of the Golgi apparatus (17Trinchera M. Fabbri M. Ghidoni R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20907-20912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 19Coste H. Martel M.B. Got R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 20Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Burger K.N. van Meer G. Wieland F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar); thus, GlcT-1-mediated reactions occur on the cytosolic surface. Other glycosylation reactions involved in GSL synthesis, however, take place on the luminal surface of the Golgi (21Ichikawa S. Hirabayashi Y. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 198-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 22van Meer G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1321-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Under in vitro conditions, cells apparently do not require the de novo synthesis of GlcCer for cellular proliferation and survival. The mouse melanoma cell line GM-95 inherently lacks GlcT-1 activity and grows without GSLs (23Ichikawa S. Nakajo N. Sakiyama H. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2703-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, when GlcT-1 function is knocked out in mice via gene-targeting techniques, these mice die at embryonic day 8 (24Yamashita T. Wada R. Sasaki T. Deng C. Bierfreund U. Sandhoff K. Proia R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9142-9147Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Moreover, enhanced apoptosis is evident in the ectodermal layer of these mice. These observations clearly point to an essential role of GSL in embryo survival. However, because GlcT-1 has multiple functions, it is difficult to explain why the elimination of the GlcT-1 gene is lethal during embryonic development in mice. Since molecular, genetic, and cell biological techniques are fully available for Drosophila, it is a very attractive alternative to vertebrate systems for examining the functions of GlcT-1. Despite having a different ceramide composition in the hydrophobic portions, membranes in Drosophila contain sphingolipids similar to those found in mammalian membranes (25Rietveld A. Neutz S. Simons K. Eaton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12049-12054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In addition, many components of cell death pathways in mammals are also conserved in Drosophila. To identify the in vivo roles of GlcT-1 through genetic manipulation, we first cloned and characterized a homologue of MGlcT-1 from Drosophila melanogaster, termed DGlcT-1. Then, we examined whether the ectopic expression or elimination of DGlcT-1 affects Drosophila development. Our data suggest that GlcT-1 functions as a regulator of intracellular ceramide levels, which in turn regulates cell death during Drosophila development. Cloning of DGlcT-1—A putative DGlcT-1 genomic DNA sequence was found in P1 clone DS00642 (accession no. AC004365) by searching nucleotide and protein databases (National Center for Biotechnology Information). A cDNA library of the adult Drosophila genome was prepared from Marathon-Ready™ cDNA (Clontech) and adult Drosophila poly (A)+RNA (Clontech). The full sequence of DGlcT-1 cDNA was determined from three RACE products derived from the Marathon-Ready/adult Drosophila cDNA library. Plasmids—The coding sequence of DGlcT-1 was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of adult Drosophila poly (A)+RNA (Clontech). The cDNA encoding full-length DGlcT-1 was subcloned into one of three expression vectors (pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen), or pUAST) (26Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HGlcT-1 deletion mutants were generated with PCR and cloned into either pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) or pdsRed-N1 (Clontech). Constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The fluorescent protein reporter plasmids pEYFP-Golgi, pEYFP-ER, and pEYFP-Mito were purchased from Clontech. Cell Culture and Transfection—GM-95 cells, a B16 melanoma mutant line of cells that lacks GlcT-1 activity (23Ichikawa S. Nakajo N. Sakiyama H. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2703-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), were cultured, transfected, and used for the enzymatic assay of GlcT-1 activity. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Plasmids were transfected into cells using TransIT Transfection Reagents (Takara). Stable cell lines were selected by addition of G418 (Calbiochem) to the culture medium. Enzyme Assay—GlcT-1 activity was assayed using synthetic NBD-ceramide as previously described (15Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12654Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), except the incubation reaction was carried out at 30 or 25 °C. Flow Cytometry—Cells were incubated for 2 h on ice with anti-GM3 monoclonal antibody (M2590) (1:500), and then for 2 h on ice with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Fluorescence intensity was analyzed by FACStar (BD Biosciences). Northern Blot Analysis and In Situ Hybridization—Commercially available Drosophila mRNAs from embryo, larva, and adult flies (Clontech) were used for Northern blot analysis. The poly(A)+ RNAs (1 μg) were subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde, then blotted onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N, Amersham Biosciences). Embryos were collected, devitellinated, and then subjected to in situ hybridization. A fragment corresponding to the complete coding region of DGlcT-1 cDNA subcloned into the Bluescript SK(+) vector was used as a template to prepare RNA probes using a digoxigenin-labeling kit (Roche Applied Sciences). Both strands were prepared separately with either T7 or T3 RNA polymerase, then used as probes for either detection (antisense strand) or the negative control (sense strand). Immunocytochemistry—Cells were grown to 40–60% confluency in low fluorescence, plastic coverslips (Sumitomo Bakelite, Tokyo). Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Following preincubation in a solution of 10% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h, the cells were incubated in a primary antibody solution containing either anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (1:500, Invitrogen) or anti-DGlcT-1 polyclonal antibody (1:500, see below) for overnight at 4 °C. The cells were washed three times, 10 min each, with phosphate-buffered saline, then incubated in either Alexa 568-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000, Vector Laboratories). The fluorescently labeled cells were photographed with a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). Generation of Anti-DGlcT-1 Antibody—Polyclonal rabbit anti-DG-lcT-1 antibody was generated by Sawady Technology using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence of the hydrophilic region of DGlcT-1 (NH2-VEDKDDPAIQLVERC-COOH, residues 88–101) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). The total IgG fraction from DGlcT-1 anti-serum was purified on a protein G-coupled affinity column and FPLC. The sensitivity of this antibody was assessed by immunostaining GM95 and DGlcT-1 cells. Electronic Microscopic Techniques—For immunoelectron microscopy, the specimens were processed using a standard technique as previously described (27Suzuki E. Hirosawa K. J. Electron Microsc. (Tokyo). 1994; 43: 183-189PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of UAS-DGlcT-1 Transgenic Flies and Strains—The DGlcT-1 gene was ectopically expressed in the eye using the GAL-4 UAS system (25Rietveld A. Neutz S. Simons K. Eaton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12049-12054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The pUAST-DGlcT-1 transgene containing DGlcT-1 cDNA was injected into w-/TM3(Δ2–3)/Dr embryos. Eight UAS-dGlcT-1 independent lines were obtained. The following transgenic fly strains were used for phenotypic analysis and genetic interactions: GMR-GAL4, GMR-grim, GMR-rpr, and GMR-hid (kind gifts from M. Okabe, T. Adachi-Yamada, and Y. Nishida). All crosses were performed at 25 °C. RNAi Experiments—RNAi experiments were conducted as described previously (28Kennerdell J.R. Carthew R.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 1017-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Double-stranded (ds) RNA was synthesized from a plasmid bearing a full-length DGlcT-1 cDNA subcloned into the Bluescript SK(+) vector. As a control, dsRNA was prepared from a Drosophila α2,6-sialyltransferase cDNA fragment (nucleotides 234–731 of the coding sequence) (29Koles K. Irvine K.D. Panin V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4346-4357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Identification and Characterization of DGlcT-1, the Drosophila Homologue of GlcT-1—Through an exhaustive TBLASTN search of the Drosophila sequence data base, we identified a sequence that was similar to the sequence of the GlcT-1 family of genes in the genomic region 58A4-58B1. This region was represented in P1 clone DS00642, which was sequenced in full. mRNA encoded by the Drosophila homologue (DGlcT-1) of GlcT-1 was obtained by RACE. Analysis of its nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame of 440 amino acids with a predicted relative molecular mass of 49 kDa. Comparison of cDNA and genomic sequences revealed that this gene did not possess an intron. To date, GlcT-1 from animals, fish, fungi, plants, and bacteria (30Leipelt M. Warnecke D. Zahringer U.

Chem. 2001; 276: 33621-33629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) have either been cloned or identified (e.g. humans, Ref. 15Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G.

The sequence identities of human, mouse, rat, C. elegans, fungi, and plant GlcT-1 are 47, 46, 46, 34, 26, and 21%, respectively. As indicated in Fig. 1, DGlcT-1 possesses motifs essential for catalytic activity such as D1, D2, and D3 and also hypothetical “nucleotide recognition domains” NRD2L and NRD2S (30Leipelt M. Warnecke D. Zahringer U. Ott C. Muller F. Hube B. Heinz E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33621-33629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 31Wu K. Marks D.L. Watanabe R. Paul P. Rajan N. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 395-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DGlcT-1 Can Catalyze the Formation of GlcCer—To determine whether DGlcT-1 is enzymatically capable of generating GlcCer, lysates from GM-95 cells stably expressing DGlcT-1 (i.e. DGlcT-1 cells) were assayed for GlcCer synthetic activity using C6-NBD-Cer as a substrate (Fig. 2). We also assayed lysates from the parental cell line from which GM-95 cells are derived, MEB4 cells; these have endogenous UDP-Glc. As expected, MEB4 cells (lanes 1 and 2) synthesized C6-NBD-GlcCer, even in the absence of UDP-Glc (lane 1). Neither GM-95 cells (lane 3) nor the mock transfectant of GM-95 cells (lane 4) synthesized C6-NBD-GlcCer. However, DGlcT-1 cells (lane 5) did synthesize C6-NBD-GlcCer. Since the normal body temperature of Drosophila is 25 °C, we also examined the enzymatic activity of DGlcT-1 at 25 °C (lane 7) (Fig. 2). There was no significant difference in the synthetic activity of DGlcT-1 at 25 and 32 °C (lanes 5 and 7). Although GM-95 cells are deficient in GlcT-1 activity, other enzymes involved in GSL synthesis remain intact. In these cells, these complementary enzymes are capable of restoring the production of GM3, the end product of GSL synthesis. Thus, we analyzed the expression of GM3 in DGlcT-1 cells using flow cytometry and the anti-GM3 mAb M2590 (Fig. 3). GM3 was as strongly expressed in DGlcT-1 cells as in MEB4 cells. This restoration of GM3 expression was not detected in the mock transfectants. GM3 was also detected in DGlcT-1 cells using TLC immunostaining with M2590 (data not shown). These results further demonstrate that DGlcT-1 is capable of catalyzing the formation of GlcCer. DGlcT-1 Is Expressed Ubiquitously—The expression of DGlcT-1 mRNA was analyzed by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4A). A single 2.6-kb transcript, consistent with the size of DGlcT-1 cDNA, was detected at embryonic and adult stages of development. The expression pattern of DGlcT-1 mRNA during Drosophila embryogenesis was examined via in situ hybridization of whole mount embryos. DGlcT-1 mRNA was expressed ubiquitously during all embryonic stages (Fig. 4B). With the exception of the central region of the embryo, which mainly contains yolk, DGlcT-1 mRNA was found in essentially all cells during germ band extension (midstage). GlcT-1 is also ubiquitously expressed throughout embryonic development in mammals (15Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12654Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The expression of DGlcT-1 during all stages of embryonic development in Drosophila suggests that DGlcT-1 may be essential for embryogenesis. DGlcT-1 Localizes in Both Golgi and ER Membranes—Ceramide can be found in various membrane compartments, such as endosomal/lysosomal membranes, rafts, mitochondrial membranes, and endoplasmic membranes. Thus, to understand the in vivo roles of GlcT-1, it is vital to identify precisely the site(s) of ceramide glycosylation. Since GlcT-1 enzymatic activity is detected mainly in the Golgi fraction, GlcT-1 is thought to be primarily located within the Golgi apparatus (17Trinchera M. Fabbri M. Ghidoni R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20907-20912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 20Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Burger K.N. van Meer G. Wieland F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, the possibility remains that GlcT-1 may also localize to other intracellular compartments. To address this issue, we examined the distribution of DGlcT-1 in GM-95 cells co-transfected with V5/His-tagged DGlcT-1 (DGlcT-1/V5-His) and pEYFP-Golgi, pEYFP-ER, or pEYFP-Mito, fluorescent markers for Golgi, ER, and mitochondria, respectively. DGlcT-1 was detected immunocytochemically with an antibody directed against the V5 tag, and co-localization with the various organelle markers was analyzed with confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 5, dense V5 immunoreactivity (Fig. 5A, red) overlapped precisely with the Golgi marker pEYFP-Golgi (Fig. 5B, green), indicating that DGlcT-1/V5-His localized mainly to the Golgi apparatus (see Fig. 5C, merged image of Fig. 5, A and B). In addition, V5 immunoreactivity (Fig. 5D, red) overlapped with the ER marker pEYFP-ER (Fig. 5E, green), indicating that DGlcT-1/V5-His also localized to the ER (see Fig. 5F). By contrast, V5 immunoreactivity (Fig. 5G, red) did not overlap with the mitochondrial marker pEYFP-Mito (Fig. 5H, green; see Fig. 5I), demonstrating that DGlcT-1/V5-His did not localize to mitochondrial membranes. These results suggest that DGlcT-1 is restricted to the Golgi apparatus and ER. We also obtained a similar localization pattern for HGlcT-1 (data not shown). To verify these double-labeling observations under in vivo conditions, we examined the intracellular distribution of DGlcT-1 in the heads of adult Drosophila flies using immunoelectron microscopy techniques (Fig. 6). Ultrathin sections were stained with an anti-DGlcT-1 antibody directed against amino acid residues 88–101 of DGlcT-1 (Fig. 6A). Western blotting analysis showed that this antibody recognized DGlcT-1 specifically (Fig. 6B). As shown in Fig. 6C, dense DGlcT-1 immunoreactivity localized within the Golgi membranes (Fig. 6C, arrow) as well as within perinuclear ER and ER membranes (Fig. 6C, arrowhead). Very similar results were also obtained when ultrathin sections were stained with anti-DGlcT-1 antibody and a gold-conjugated secondary antibody (data not shown). Consistent with our confocal microscopy findings, electron dense DGlcT-1 immunoreactivity was neither observed in the mitochondria nor plasma membranes. Control serum did not give any positive staining (data not shown). N-terminal and TM Regions of GlcT-1 Are Required for Golgi Localization—Of the glycosylation enzymes involved in GSL synthesis, GlcT-1 is unique in that it is the only glycosyltransferase that carries out its reactions in the parts of the Golgi apparatus adjacent to the cytoplasm (20Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Burger K.N. van Meer G. Wieland F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 21Ichikawa S. Hirabayashi Y. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 198-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 22van Meer G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1321-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Hydropathy plot analysis revealed that GlcT-1 has a single strong hydrophobic segment near its N terminus (amino acids 1–10), a putative signal-anchor sequence containing a single strong hydrophobic segment (amino acids 11–36), and a long cytosolic tail that may be a catalytic domain (15Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12654Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To determine whether the putative signal anchor sequence is responsible for localizing GlcT-1 to the Golgi, we made V5/His-tagged fusion protein constructs containing truncated forms of HGlcT-1 (Fig. 7I), transfected GM95 cells with these constructs, and then we examined the intracellular distribution of these truncated forms with anti-V5 antibody. As expected, full-length GlcT-1 localized within the Golgi (data not shown). V5/His-tagged fusion proteins (Fig. 7I, panels A–G) containing the N-terminal region also localized within the Golgi membranes (data not shown). Deletion of the N-terminal region (Fig. 7I, panel H) sufficiently abolished V5 immunoreactivity in the Golgi suggesting that this region is important for GlcT-1 localization in the Golgi. To confirm whether the N-terminal region alone is sufficient for localization to the Golgi, we made dsRed fusion protein constructs containing the N-terminal region plus the membrane-spanning region (Fig. 7I, panel I), and examined the expression of the construct in GM95 cells. In cells that expressed the dsRed-tagged fusion protein containing both the N-terminal region and the membrane-spanning region, intense fluorescence localized within the Golgi. These deletion analyses indicate that both the N-terminal and TM regions (amino acids 1∼36) of GlcT-1 are important for Golgi localization. Ectopic Expression of GlcT-1 Partially Rescues Cell Death Induced by RPR, GRIM, and HID—To examine the in vivo function of DGlcT-1 in Drosophila, UAS-DGlcT-1 lines of flies were crossed with GMR-Gal4 lines, and the eye phenotype of the resulting progeny was examined for signs of apoptosis. Retinal apoptosis is typically manifested by small eye size and/or eye ablations (32White K. Grether M.E. Abrams J.M. Young L. Farrell K. Steller H. Science. 1994; 264: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar, 33Chen P. Nordstrom W. Gish B. Abrams J.M.

Transgenic flies carrying a single copy of UAS-DGlcT-1 (UAS-DGlcT-1/CyO; GMR-Gal4/TM3) did not exhibit significant abnormalities in eye phenotype (Fig. 8B). The fairly normal eye morphology displayed by these flies may be caused by low level expression of DGlcT-1. Flies carrying increased copies of UAS-DGlcT-1 (2 or 3 copies) also did not exhibit eye abnormalities (data not shown). Although we screened a number of UAS-DGlcT-1 lines, we failed to obtain transgenic flies that expressed high levels of DGlcT-1. This was also observed for transgenic mice that overexpress GlcT-1. 2T. Okamura, I. Miyoshi, and Y. Hirabayashi, unpublished data. These results suggest that GlcT-1 expression levels might be tightly regulated and high level expression of GlcT-1 might be toxic to cells. In Drosophila, apoptosis occurs during embryonic development and metamorphosis and is controlled by the expression of three genes, reaper (rpr) (32White K. Grether M.E. Abrams J.M. Young L.

The PG J family is involved in mediating various biological effects including the regulation of cell cycle progression and inflammatory responses. Here we demonstrate the potential role of 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PG J2) in human articular chondrocyte apoptosis. 15d-PG J2 was released by human articular chondrocytes and found in joint synovial fluids taken from osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis patients. Proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) up-regulated chondrocyte release of 15d-PG J2. PG D2 synthase mRNA expression was up-regulated by IL-1β, TNF-α, or nitric oxide. 15d-PG J2 induced apoptosis of chondrocytes from osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis patients as well as control nonarthritic subjects in a time- and dose-dependent manner and in a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ-dependent manner. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ expression was up-regulated by IL-1β and TNF-α. Inhibition of NF-κB, and the activation of p38 MAPK were also found to be involved in 15d-PG J2-induced chondrocyte apoptosis. Such signal pathways led to the activation of the downstream pro-apoptotic molecule p53 and caspase cascades.

An imbalance between destructive and reparative processes affecting components of the extracellular matrix can result in destruction of articular cartilage. Because articular chondrocytes are the only cells residing in cartilage tissue, matrix turnover is solely dependent on these cells, and thus, their survival is essential for maintaining proper architecture of the articular cartilage.In arthropathies such as osteoarthritis (OA) 1The abbreviations used are: OA, osteoarthritis; PG, prostaglandin; 15d-PG J2, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; IL-1β, interleukin 1β; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; PGDS, PG D2 synthase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK1/2, extracellular signalregulated kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; PI, propidium iodide; TGF, transforming growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; RT, reverse transcription. 1The abbreviations used are: OA, osteoarthritis; PG, prostaglandin; 15d-PG J2, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; IL-1β, interleukin 1β; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; PGDS, PG D2 synthase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK1/2, extracellular signalregulated kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; PI, propidium iodide; TGF, transforming growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; RT, reverse transcription. and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), hypocellularity and matrix degeneration in cartilage are believed to contribute to joint degradation (1Hashimoto S.

In OA and RA joints, chondrocytes showing characteristic features of apoptotic death, such as chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, cellular shrinkage, and apoptotic body formation (3Green D.R. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 193: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), have been observed. Chondrocyte death by apoptosis may, therefore, be of pathogenic significance in the development of arthritis (4Blanco F.J. Guitian R. Vazquez-Martul E. de Toro F.J. Galdo P.

These mediators include Fas and its ligand FasL (6Lotz M. Hashimoto S. Kühn K. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1999; 7: 389-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 7Hashimoto H.

Biochem. 1998; 71: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). One member of the prostaglandins (PGs) family, PG E2, was reported to induce bovine chondrocyte apoptosis (10Miwa M. Saura R. Hirata S. Hayashi Y. Mizuno K. Itoh H. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2000; 8: 17-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) but whether such effects can be identified for other members of the PGs family, for example, PG D2 or its metabolite, PG J2, is largely unknown.Cyclopentenone prostaglandins are important regulators of cellular function in a variety of tissues, including bone and cartilage. PG D2 is a mediator of allergy and inflammation (11Matsuoka T. Hirata M. Tanaka H. Takahashi Y. Murata T. Kabashima K. Sugimoto Y. Kobayashi T. Ushikubi F. Aze Y. Eguchi N. Urade Y. Yoshida N. Kimura K. Mizoguchi A. Honda Y. Nagai H. Narumiya S. Science. 2000; 287: 2013-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Its metabolite, PG J2 is formed within the PG D2 cyclopentenone ring by dehydration. PG J2 is metabolized further to yield Δ12-PG J2 and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14 PG J2 (15d-PG J2). Members of the PG J series have been reported to mediate various biological effects including inhibition of cell cycle progression, inhibition of cytokine production in macrophages, and involvement in inflammatory responses (12Cuzzocrea S. Wayman N.S. Mazzon E. Dugo L. Paola R.D. Serraino I. Britti D. Chatterjee P.K. Caputi A.P. Thiemermann C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In contrast to classical prostaglandins, which bind to cell surface G protein-coupled receptors, 15d-PG J2 is a natural ligand of a nuclear receptor, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ. This receptor behaves as a ligand-activated transcription factor through its DNA binding domain, which recognizes response elements in the promoter of some target genes linked to apoptosis, cell proliferation, and differentiation and inflammation (13Kliewer S.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12243-12250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and indicate that 15d-PG J2 is the most potent endogenous ligand for PPARγ yet discovered (16Bishop-Bailey D. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17042-17048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar).To date, Δ12-PG J2 has been detected in human plasma or serum (17Fukushima M. Sasaki H. Fukushima S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 744: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, little is known about whether 15d-PG J2 can be released from human articular chondrocytes, and the significance of the in vivo presence of 15d-PG J2 still remains controversial (18Bell-Parikh L.C. Ide T. Lawson J.A. McNamara P. Reilly M. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 945-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence documents the induction of apoptosis in various cells, especially in tumor cells, by 15d-PG J2, and this compound also inhibits tumor growth (19Hashimoto K. Ethridge R.T. Evers B.M. Int. J. Gastrointest. Cancer. 2002; 32: 7-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the effect of 15d-PG J2 on chondrocyte viability has not been defined, although the implication of 15d-PG J2 in the pathogenesis of arthritis was demonstrated (20Fahmi H. Di Battista J.A. Pelletier J.P. Mineau F. Ranger P. Martel-Pelletier J. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 595-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 21Kawahito Y. Kondo M. Tsubouchi Y.

We also demonstrated that 15d-PG J2-induced chondrocyte apoptosis is dependent on the inhibition of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway member p38 kinase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials15-Deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2, Δ12-PG J2, PG J2, PG E2, ciglitazone, pioglitazone, GW9662, and T0070907 were obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was from Sigma. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) were obtained from Wako (Osaka, Japan). benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(OCH3) fluoromethyl ketone was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). PD 98059 and SB 202190 were obtained from Calbiochem. All other reagents were of analytical grade. The final concentration of organic solvent used to dilute 15d-PG J2 or other reagents was not greater than 0.3%, which did not provoke any changes in cellular viability, as demonstrated in a preliminary study (data not shown).SamplesArticular cartilage specimens were obtained from 9 OA patients (73 ± 8 years; male/female, 6/3) and 7 RA patients (55 ± 13 years; male/female, 3/4) who were undergoing joint replacement surgery. Synovial fluids were obtained by regular therapeutic arthrocentesis in an outpatient clinic from a different panel of OA and RA patients (n = 25 and 29, respectively). All patients met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for OA (22Altman R. Asch E. Bloch D. Bole G. Borenstein D. Brandt K. Christy W. Cooke T.D. Greenwald R. Hochberg M. Howell D. Kaplan D.

Arthritis-free human cartilage was collected from 4 patients (65 ± 2 years; male/female, 3/1) with no history of arthritis who were undergoing joint surgery after traumatic fracture. All samples were obtained with informed consent from the patients, and the study protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee.Isolation and Culture of ChondrocytesCartilage slices were removed from the femoral heads or knee and washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). Tissues were then minced and transferred to a digestion buffer containing DMEM, anti-yeast (Invitrogen), and 0.1% collagenase (type IV). Tissue was incubated on a shaker at 37 °C until the fragments were digested. The cells were filtered through a nylon mesh with a pore diameter of 70 μm and washed by suspension and centrifugation in DMEM. The pellet was resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were then seeded in 10-cm dishes at a density of 5∼7 × 105/ml. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2, and the medium was changed once a week. The confluent cells were dispersed by trypsinization and then transferred to new dishes in a split ratio of 1:2∼1:4. Monolayer cultured chondrocytes of the first passage were used throughout the experiments. The chondrocytes were starved in DMEM with 0.5% fetal calf serum for 24 h before each experiment.15d-PG J2 AssayThe levels of immunoreactive 15d-PG J2 in cultured chondrocyte supernatants were determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method according to the manufacturer's instructions using commercially available kits purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The minimum detectable concentration of 15d-PG J2 in this assay is typically less than 36.8 pg/ml. Cross-reactivity was only detectable for PG J2 (49.2%), Δ2-PG J2 (5.99%), or PG D2 (4.92%) but was less than 0.01% for other PGs according to the manufacturer's information.Heparin (0.3 mg/ml) was added as an anticoagulant to the synovial fluid taken from 25 OA or 29 RA patients. The synovial fluids were then centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g to remove particulates. The samples were extracted through a C18 reverse phase column, then washed with 15% ethanol and deionized water, eluted from the column by ethyl acetate. The organic solvent was then evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. Samples were reconstituted, and ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.Determination of ApoptosisNuclear Morphology—The harvested primary passage chondrocytes were seeded into 8-well chamber slides (300 μl of cell suspension/well). When confluent, nuclear morphology was assessed by labeling stimulated or unstimulated adherent cells or 30 min at 37 °C with 1 μm Hoechst 33342 (Sigma). Cultures were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and examined by fluorescence microscopy.Cell Viability Assay—The chondrocytes were seeded into 6-well micro-plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. After serum starvation for 24 h, they were treated with the indicated effectors. Untreated cells served as controls. After medium was transferred to a 15-ml conical tube, the adherent chondrocytes were removed by trypsin/EDTA treatment and transferred to the tube containing culture medium. Cells, debris, and apoptotic bodies were pelleted by centrifugation and then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. The washed pellet was subsequently labeled with Guava ViaCount reagent (Guava, Hayward, CA). Viable, apoptotic, and dead cell populations were analyzed using a small desktop Guava personal cytometer with ViaCount and Express software (Guava). The system counts the stained nucleated events, then uses the forward scatter properties to distinguish free nuclei and cellular debris from cells to determine an accurate cell count (24Ogasawara K. Yoshinaga S.K. Lanier L.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3676-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The collected chondrocytes were also labeled with 0.5 μg/ml annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Wako) and 2 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) to document early stages of chondrocyte apoptosis. The fluorescein isothiocyanate signal of annexin V was detected at 518 nm by FL1 (fluorescein isothiocyanate detector), and propidium iodide fluorescence was detected at 620 nm by FL2 (phycoerythrin fluorescence detector).Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR and Real-time PCR AnalysisTotal cellular RNA was extracted from confluent chondrocytes by a single-step guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan). RNA was recovered in diethyl cyanophosphonated water and quantified by spectrophotometry at 260 and 280 nm. For RT-PCR, RNA samples were reverse-transcribed to cDNA using reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers (TaKaRa Biomedicals, Osaka, Japan). The primer sequences as well as the number of cycles are shown in Table I. The PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, 30∼35 cycles of amplification (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C) in an automated thermal cycler (TaKaRa Biomedicals) followed by a final extension step of 5 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels and photographed under ultraviolet excitation after ethidium bromide staining. PPARγ and p53 mRNA expression levels were also determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR using fluorescence-labeled (Light Cycler-Fast Start DNA Master SYBR Green I, Roche Applied Science) primers and LightCycler software (Roche Applied Science). Normalized gene expression was calculated as the ratio between PPARγ or p53 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase copy number.Table ISequences of primers used for PCR amplification of cDNA, product sizes, and PCR cycle numbersGenePrimerSequenceSizeCycleAccession numberbpPGDS-Hematopoietic5′GAACAAGCTGACTGGC27335NM_0144853′AGGCGCATTATACGTGPGDS, brain5′CACCGACTACGACCAG20435BC0059393′TGTTCCGTCATGCACTTATCPPARγ5′TTCCCGCTGACCAAAG35635BC0068113′CCCTCGGATATGAGAACCp535′AGCATCTTATCCGAGTGG30035NM_0005463′TCTTGCGGAGATTCTCTTGAPDH5′CCCTCGGATATGAGAACC22630NM_0020463′GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC Open table in a new tab ImmunocytochemistryImmunochemical staining was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (goat ABC staining system; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Chondrocytes were cultured at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well in 4-well chamber slides. Subconfluent chondrocytes were fixed with 10% methanol. The cells were incubated with primary goat polyclonal antibody to PG D2 synthase (PGDS) or PPARγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. The cell-bound antibody complexes were then visualized by development in a substrate solution containing 3,3′-diaminobenzidine to yield a red-brown reaction product. A dilution of normal goat serum containing the same concentrations of nonspecific immunoglobulin G as primary antibody served as a negative control.Western Blotting AnalysisWhole cell lysates were prepared from 1.5 × 106 chondrocytes stimulated with the indicated effectors. The trypsinized adherent cells were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed with 0.1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS and supplemented with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF and 2 mm Na3VO4). The lysates were transferred to Eppendorf tubes, and the protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. Similar amounts of protein were size-fractionated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, the protein expression was determined using specific antibodies purchased from Cell Signaling Technology: goat anti-phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, rabbit anti-ERK1/2, rabbit anti-phospho-p38, and rabbit anti-p38. The blots were developed using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and an enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences).Caspase-3 and NF-κB Activity AssayCaspase-3 activity was assayed on whole cell lysates by commercially available kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Briefly, after treatment of cells (1∼2×106 cells in a 10-cm dish) with or without the indicated stimulation, the adherent chondrocytes were harvested by trypsinization and lysed for 1 min on ice in 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. The lysates were pooled and centrifuged, and the supernatant was used to determine caspase-3 activity. The fluorescence intensity was measured with an excitation filter of 420 nm and an emission filter of 535 nm. The whole cell lysates were also used for NF-κB p65 activity determination using a commercially available kit (Pierce). Briefly, the 96-well plate was coated with the bound NF-κB-biotinylated consensus sequence so that only the active form of NF-κB bound to the DNA sequence. Whole cell lysates were added to the plates and incubated with the specific primary antibody (NF-κB p65) followed by the secondary antibody, and the resulting signal was then captured by chemiluminescent detection.Statistical AnalysisFor all results shown at least three separate experiments with cells from different donors were performed. Within experiments, each individual measurement was performed in duplicate. Except where specifically mentioned, one-way analysis of variance was used to analyze the differences between different groups for the production of 15d-PG J2 and the percentage of apoptosis. The data on 15d-PG J2 concentrations in synovial fluids are nonparametric. Therefore, the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the difference between OA and RA patients. p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSProduction of 15d-PG J2 by Chondrocytes and Concentrations in Synovial Fluid—We first investigated whether cultured human articular chondrocytes produce 15d-PG J2 in vitro. As shown in Fig. 1, both OA and RA chondrocytes in the resting state released 15d-PG J2, as assayed by ELISA (OA, 221 ± 14 pg/ml; RA, 297 ± 51 pg/ml). However, levels were lower than in normal chondrocyte cultures (579 ± 49 pg/ml). Stimulation with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) and SNP (2 mm) led to a significantly increased production of 15d-PG J2 in OA, RA, and normal chondrocytes. We also found that 1 μm PG E2 slightly but significantly enhanced 15d-PG J2 production levels. TNF-α (25 ng/ml) did not significantly augment 15d-PG J2 production. On the other hand, 15d-PG J2 levels were significantly decreased by TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml). In particular, 15d-PG J2 levels in OA chondrocytes after TGF-β1 treatment were below the levels of detection (Fig. 1A).15d-PG J2 was detectable by ELISA in synovial fluids of 25 OA and 29 RA patients whereby one of the former had a much higher 15d-PG J2 concentration than any of the others. On the whole, however, 15d-PG J2 concentrations in synovial fluids were at pg/ml levels, and no obvious difference between OA and RA patients was observed (Fig. 1B).PGD2 Synthase Expression and Its Regulation by Proinflammatory Cytokines—PG D2 is naturally and rapidly converted into PG J2 by nonenzymatic pathways, and PG J2 itself is rapidly metabolized to Δ12-PG J2 and 15d-PG J2 after elimination of one or two water molecules. Therefore, we assessed PGDS expression as a measure of PG J2-synthesizing enzyme. The expression, at the RNA level, of two subtypes of synthases, brain and hematopoietic PGDS, was evaluated using specific primers. Brain PGDS mRNA was constitutively expressed in OA chondrocytes at a level not influenced by proinflammatory cytokine stimulation. In contrast, the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α up-regulated hematopoietic PGDS mRNA expression. 1 mm SNP treatment also induced increased levels of hematopoietic PGDS mRNA in OA chondrocytes. Peak induction occurred 48 h after stimulation (Fig. 2, A and B).To confirm the expression and localization of PGDS in human articular chondrocytes, immunohistochemistry was performed using polyclonal anti-PGDS antibody. We found markedly enhanced expression of PGDS in OA chondrocytes stimulated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml, 48-hour stimulation) or TNF-α (25 ng/ml, 48-h stimulation). PGDS in OA chondrocytes was mainly localized to the nucleus and cytoplasmic region (Fig. 2, D and E). OA chondrocytes treated with SNP (1 mm, 48-h stimulation) also up-regulated PGDS, but the shape of the cells after treatment was irregular, and PGDS immunoreactivity appeared to be completely localized to the nucleus (Fig. 2F). These data provide evidence that human chondrocytes are potent producers of PG J2 series molecules upon activation of PGDS by inflammatory stimuli.Prostaglandins of the J Series Induce Chondrocyte Apoptosis—Next we evaluated the potency of the PG J series to induce chondrocyte apoptosis. First, the characteristic nuclear morphological changes, such as nuclear condensation, cell shrinkage, and appearance of small membrane-bound bodies (apoptotic bodies) were observed by Hoechst staining (Fig. 3A). This suggests apoptotic nuclear changes of chondrocytes after stimulation with PG J series molecules. Cytometry analyses were performed to quantify apoptosis induced by 15d-PG J2, an end-product of the PG J series. OA chondrocyte apoptosis was first demonstrated by annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining. The inversion of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer plasma membrane occurs early in the apoptotic program and is often used as a specific marker of cells undergoing apoptosis. Flow cytometry analyses of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V binding to OA chondrocytes are shown in Fig. 3B. Chondrocytes were counterstained with PI to distinguish between viable cells (annexin V-/PI-, lower left quadrant of the histograms), early apoptotic (annexin V+/PI-, lower right quadrant of the histograms), and late apoptotic or necrotic cells (annexin V+/PI+, upper right quadrant of the histograms). Early (annexin V+/PI-) and late apoptotic (annexin V+/PI+) chondrocytes constituted a much higher percentage of the total gated cells after stimulation with 10 μm 15d-PG J2 compared with unstimulated chondrocytes. The total apoptotic cell number counted by Guava staining was in accordance with annexin V/PI staining (Fig. 3, B and C).Fig. 3Induction of nuclear morphological changes and apoptosis by 15d-PG J2 in human articular chondrocytes.A, normal, RA, and OA chondrocytes were incubated with or without 15d-PG J2 (10 μm) for 48 h and then stained with Hoechst 33342. Cells with morphological changes such as condensed nuclei are suggested to be apoptotic. B, representative data of annexin V/PI staining of OA chondrocytes. Serum-starved OA chondrocytes were treated with solvent only or 10 μm 15d-PG J2 for 48 h. The harvested adherent cells including culture medium and washings were pelleted for analyses of annexin V and PI staining by flow cytometry. Annexin V and PI staining is represented on the x axis (FL1) and y axis (FL2), respectively. Analyses represent data collected on 10,000 gated cells. Values in the quadrants represent the percentage of total gated cells. Similar data were obtained in two additional independent experiments. C, representative histogram data of Guava ViaCount assay of OA chondrocytes. Cell culture and 15d-PG J2 stimulation were the same as for annexin V/PI staining. The harvested adherent cells including culture medium and washings were pelleted before labeling for Guava ViaCount assay. Analyses represent data collected on 5000 gated cells. The viability marker (red) separating viable cells (left) from apoptotic cells (right) is shown. Apoptosis marker (purple) separating apoptotic cells (left) from dead cells (right) is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)As summarized in Fig. 4, 15d-PG J2 induced chondrocyte apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 0∼10 μm in RA, OA, and normal samples (Fig. 4A) and in a time-dependent manner in OA chondrocytes (Fig. 4B). The magnitude of apoptosis induction by 15d-PG J2 was similar in RA and OA chondrocytes. The arthritic chondrocyte apoptosis was further documented by significantly increased caspase-3 activity after stimulation with 15d-PG J2 (see Fig. 7E). Furthermore, the effects of PG E2, SNP, and several proinflammatory cytokines on cell viability were compared with the effect of 15d-PG J2. Added as an exogenous donor of nitric oxide (NO), 2 mm SNP exerted a potent apoptotic effect. 1 μm PG E2 also induced chondrocyte apoptosis. However, no significant apoptotic effect of IL-1β (10 ng/ml), TNF-α (25 ng/ml), or TGF-β1 (20 ng/ml) on chondrocytes was observed (Fig. 4C). We next explored whether a low dose of 15d-PG J2 (0.1 μm) could enhance NO-induced chondrocyte apoptosis. Neither 0.1 μm 15d-PG J2 nor 0.2 mm SNP alone could"

We here report that respiratory-deficient cells become strictly dependent on the Gpd2p isoform of the NAD+-linked glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gpd). The growth inhibition of respiratory incompetent cox18Δ cells lacking GPD2 is reversed by the addition of acetoin, an alternative sink for NADH oxidation. Growth is also restored by addition of lysine or glutamic acid/glutamine, the synthesis of which involves production of mitochondrial NADH. Lysine produced a stronger growth stimulating effect than glutamic acid consistent with an upregulated expression of the IDP3 gene for peroxisomal synthesis of the glutamate precursor α-ketoglutarate. Gpd2p is known to be a cytosolic protein but possesses a classical mitochondrial presequence, which we show is sufficient for mitochondrial targeting. A partial mitochondrial localization of Gpd2p will provide for establishment of intramitochondrial redox balance under non-respiratory conditions. Gpd1p, the other Gpd isoform, is partly cytosolic and partly peroxisomal and becomes more strictly peroxisomal in respiratory-deficient mutants.

Like other organisms, yeasts derive energy from controlled oxidation of molecular substrates using NADH as the major carrier of the generated reducing equivalents. The limiting amounts of this coenzyme (1de Koning W. van Dam K. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) require that it is rapidly reoxidized so that the cellular redox reactions do not become restricted by lack of NAD+. Since NADH cannot pass the mitochondrial inner membrane (2von Jagow G. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 12: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), it has to be re-oxidized in the compartment where it is produced by transfer of the reducing equivalents to a suitable acceptor molecule. Under aerobic conditions Saccharomyces cerevisiae has several mechanisms to re-oxidize NADH, thereby allowing metabolism to proceed (3Bakker B.M. Overkamp K.M. van Maris A.J. Kotter P. Luttik M.A. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 15-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosolic NADH can be transferred into mitochondria by two mechanisms, (i) by the mitochondrial external NADH dehydrogenase Nde1p/Nde2p or (ii) by the glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) 1The abbreviations used are: G3P, glycerol 3-phosphate; Gpd, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: G3P, glycerol 3-phosphate; Gpd, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFP, green fluorescent protein. shuttle in which Gut2p, an FAD-linked glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, oxidizes G3P to dihydroxyacetone phosphate in the intermembrane space, delivering the reducing equivalents to the respiratory chain (4Rönnow B.

In S. cerevisiae the NADH formed in the mitochondrial matrix can be oxidized by the internal NADH dehydrogenase, encoded by the NDI1 gene (9Marres C.A. de Vries S. Grivell L.A. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1992; 203: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).Under non-respiratory conditions when yeast cells are entirely dependent on fermentation for biomass and energy, they require alternative mechanisms for re-oxidation of NADH. Although the fermentation of glucose to ethanol is redox neutral, synthesis of biomass and organic acids generate net production of NADH (11Nordström K. J. Inst. Brew. 1968; 74: 429-432Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Albers E. Lidén G. Larsson C. Gustafsson L. Rec. Devel. Microbiol. 1998; 2: 253-279Google Scholar, 13Nissen T.L. Schulze U. Nielsen J. Villadsen J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Carbon and redox balance studies have demonstrated that yeast cells achieve redox balance under anaerobic conditions by NADH-dependent reduction of DHAP to G3P and subsequent production of glycerol (11Nordström K.

Microbiol. 1997; 63: 128-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), confirm the supposition that glycerol production is an exclusive sink for reducing equivalents under non-respiratory conditions. Hence, one of the physiological roles of glycerol production is to serve as an outlet for surplus NADH. Glycerol can serve this function also under aerobic conditions, e.g. on growth at high glucose concentrations, which repress respiration and reduces the respiratory capacity to oxidize NADH. In addition, glycerol has another important physiological function; it serves as an osmoregulator and is produced and accumulated in cells subjected to hyperosmotic stress to prevent loss of water and turgor of the cells (19Brown A.D. Adv. Microbial. Physiol. 1978; 17: 181-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 20André L. Hemming A. Adler L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 286: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 21Larsson K. Eriksson P. Ansell R. Adler L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The isoform of NADH-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase that has a prime role in anaerobic production of glycerol is encoded by the GPD2 gene (17Ansell R. Granath K. Hohmann S. Thevelein J. Adler L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2179-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 18Björkqvist S. Ansell R. Adler L. Lidén G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 128-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while the other isoform of the enzyme, Gpd1p, is used for osmostress-induced glycerol production (21Larsson K. Eriksson P. Ansell R. Adler L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22Albertyn J. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4135-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Gpd1p also appears to be the isoform responsible for the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in the G3P shuttle (8Larsson C. Påhlman I.-L. Ansell R. Rigoulet M. Adler L. Gustafsson L. Yeast. 1998; 14: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). While the osmostress-induced expression of the GPD1 gene has been extensively studied (reviewed in Refs. 23Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 24Hohmann S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 300-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar), the regulation of the GPD2 gene remains uncharacterized. It is reported that GPD2 expression is induced in cells shifted to anaerobic conditions (17Ansell R. Granath K. Hohmann S. Thevelein J. Adler L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2179-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 25Costenoble R. Valadi H. Gustafsson L. Niklasson C. Franzén C.J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1483-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and in cells, which have a respiratory activity that has been indirectly or directly inhibited (17Ansell R. Granath K. Hohmann S. Thevelein J. Adler L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2179-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 26Ansell R. Adler L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 27Epstein C.B. Waddle J.A. Hale IV W. Dave V. Thornton J. Macatee T.L. Garner H.R. Butow R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar).It is estimated that up to 50% of the NADH that is generated in amino acid biosynthesis is produced in the mitochondrial matrix (12Albers E. Lidén G. Larsson C. Gustafsson L. Rec. Devel. Microbiol. 1998; 2: 253-279Google Scholar). A substantial part of this production stems from synthesis of the glutamate precursor, α-ketoglutarate (13Nissen T.L. Schulze U. Nielsen J. Villadsen J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It is, however, not clear how surplus NADH in the mitochondrial matrix is re-oxidized to NAD+ under anaerobic conditions. It has been suggested that a putative ethanol-acetaldehyde shuttle has a role in the process (2von Jagow G. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 12: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 3Bakker B.M. Overkamp K.M. van Maris A.J. Kotter P. Luttik M.A. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 15-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to this model, acetaldehyde diffuses from the cytosol into the mitochondria where it is reduced to ethanol by the NADH linked mitochondrial alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh3). Subsequent diffusion of the produced ethanol to the cytosol will remove redox equivalents from the mitochondrial matrix, thereby contributing to redox balance.We here report on the role of Gpd1p and Gpd2p in cellular redox control in respiratory sufficient and insufficient yeast strains grown under controlled conditions. To avoid nutritional supplementation that may affect cellular redox conditions (28Pronk J.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 2095-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), we have used prototrophic yeast strains whenever possible. We observed that respiratory insufficiency strongly enhances requirement for GPD2 to relieve the intracellular redox imbalance that appears to arise in the mitochondrial matrix. The reason that Gpd1p cannot substitute well for Gpd2p in this function seems due to important differences in the cellular localization of the two iso-enzymes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Media—S. cerevisiae strains utilized in this study are listed in Table I. The YPD medium used contained 1% (w/v) yeast extract (Merck), 2% (w/v) Bacto-peptone (Merck), and 2% (w/v) glucose (Merck). The YNB medium used was composed of 0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 0.5% (w/v) ammonium sulfate (Merck), and 2% (w/v) glucose. For ethanol agar plates, glucose was replaced by 2% (w/v) ethanol. The pH of all media was adjusted to 6.0. Solid media contained 2% (w/v) agar (Merck). Cell densities of liquid cultures were determined from OD measurements at 610 nm using a Novaspec II spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences).Table IS. cerevisiae strains used in this studyStrainsGenotypeRef.YHV1MATa, prototrophic W303 -1AH.

Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998Google Scholar, 30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Strains having a deleted COX18 gene were constructed using a the cox18Δ::kanMX4 cassette generated by PCR amplification of DNA isolated from the BY 4741 YGR062c::kanMX4 strain, using the oligonucleotides 5′-GTTGCCTCACTACAAACCGAGGGATGGCAG-3′ and 5′-ACTTGACTTCTTTTGTTATGGACCTGGGAG-3′. Transformants were selected on YPD plates containing 200 mg/liter geneticin (G418, Sigma-Aldrich) and integration was confirmed using PCR. To analyze for effects of GPD gene overexpression relevant strains were transformed with the multicopy plasmid YEplac112 carrying the GPD1 gene. To generate a GFP-tagged version of the putative N-terminal targeting sequence of Gpd2p, oligonucleotides with attached ClaI sites were used to PCR amplify a GPD2 fragment spanning the region from –1000 bp to +51 bp. The PCR primers used were 5′-ATCGATTAGTGGGGAGAGTTTCGTGCA-3′ and 5′-ATCGATGCGTTCGCTTAAGGAATGT-3′. The resulting fragment was ligated into the 2.1-TopoVector (Invitrogen), and transformed into Escherichia coli Top10F′ (Invitrogen). Plasmids were isolated using a commercial kit (QIAgen), cleaved with ClaI (Roche Applied Science) and purified by gel extraction (Qiagen). The fragment was inserted into the ClaI site of a GFP (green fluorescent protein) carrying pRS426 plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. P. Sunnerhagen). The construct was controlled by digestion with ClaI (Roche Applied Science) and HindIII (Roche Applied Science). GPD1 was GFP-tagged using 5′-ATCGATAGCCCGAAAGAGTTATCGTTA-3′ and 5′-ATCGATATCTTCATGTAGATCTAATTCTT-3′ including flanking ClaI sites. The resulting PCR fragment contains 1000 base pairs from the native promoter of GPD1 and the complete open reading frame. The fragment was cloned into the pRS426 GFP plasmid using the same procedure as for GPD2 (above). Fragment orientation of GPD1 was confirmed using SalI (Roche Applied Science).Growth Conditions for Controlled Batch Cultures—Liquid precultures were grown at 30 °C with shaking (200 rpm) in 1.5× YNB medium containing 1% (w/v) glucose. Batch cultures were grown in duplicates in SARA BR 0.5 bioreactors (Belach Bioteknik) containing 750 ml of the same medium, using air (aerobiosis) or oxygen-free nitrogen gas (anaerobiosis) as the sparge gas at a flow rate of 30.0 liters/h (Bronkhorst Hi-tech). Medium for anaerobic cultures contained ergosterol, Tween 80 (a source of oleic acid) and antifoam as previously described (31Andreasen A.A. Stier T.J.B. J. Cell Comp. Physiol. 1953; 41: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 32Andreasen A.A. Stier T.J.B. J. Cell Comp. Physiol. 1954; 43: 271-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For cultures growing with an artificial redox sink, acetoin (1 g/liter) was added prior to inoculation. The temperature was maintained at 30 °C, pH 5.0, and the stirring rate was kept at 500 rpm for anaerobic cultures and 800 rpm for aerobic cultures. The heat production rate was monitored by a multichannel microcalorimeter (2277 Thermal Activity Monitor, Thermometric). Oxygen concentration and CO2 production rate were followed using a gas analyzer (Innova).Growth Conditions for E-flask Cultures—To study whether overexpression of GPD genes could reverse the growth arrest of the redox-inhibited gpd2Δcox18Δ strain, the auxotrophic gpd2Δcox18Δ, gpd2Δcox18Δ+YEplac112-GPD1, and gpd2Δcox18Δ+YEplac112-GPD2 were cultured in E-flasks at 30 °C with shaking (200 rpm) in 1.5× YNB medium adjusted to pH 6.0, containing 1% glucose and appropriate amino acids and nucleotides. To study whether additions of growth factors could reverse the growth arrest of the prototrophic gpd2Δcox18Δ strain, the minimal medium was provided with additions of amino acids or nucleotides at a concentration of 120 μg per ml.Determination of Glucose and Glycerol Concentrations—Samples for metabolite analyses were withdrawn from batch cultures and heat-treated at 100 °C for 5 min before centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min. The obtained supernatants were stored at –20 °C until analyzed. The glycerol and glucose concentration were analyzed using commercial kits, following the manufacturer's protocol (Biochemica Test Combination; Roche Applied Sciences).Northern Analysis—Samples for Northern blot analysis were taken from batch cultures and immediately transferred to liquid nitrogen prior to storage at –20 °C. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) using cell cultures that had reached an OD610 value of 1. Samples containing 15 μg of total RNA were separated on a low formaldehyde (2.5%, v/v) denaturing agarose gels at 75 V/cm. Separated RNA was blotted by capillary transfer to positively charged nylon membranes (Hybond, Amersham Biosciences) using 10× SSC as transfer buffer. Cross-linking of the RNA was achieved using low wavelength UV light and subsequent baking of the membrane at 80 °C for 2 h. Pre-hybridization was accomplished at 55 °C for 3–4 h in 5× SSC, 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 10× Denhardt′s solution, 2% SDS and 10 mg/ml carrier DNA. Hybridization was achieved at 55 °C for 18–20 h in the above mentioned pre-hybridization buffer supplemented with 10% PEG 4000. Oligonucleotides were used for transcript detection, and 5 ng/ml hybridization solution was labeled with [32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) using 5 units of polynucleotide kinase (MBI) for every 50-ng probe used, and the labeling reaction was conducted at 37 °C for 30 min. Excess ATP nucleotides was removed via centrifugation through a Sephadex G50 mini column.Post-hybridization washes were performed in 1× SSC plus 1% SDS for 2 × 15 min at room temperature followed by a 15-min wash at hybridization temperature (55 °C). Membranes were scanned and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics Phosphorimager (FX, Bio-Rad) using the software Quantity One. Sequence of the oligonucleotides used were: GPD1: 5′-TGTACTATTGGAGCGAAAACTTCT-3′, GPD2: 5′-GGTCCTCATGACAGTGTTTGTGCT-3′, IDP3 5′-GTC CCT CAC TGG GAG AAA CCT ATA ATT ATA-3′, and for the control IPP: 5′-TGTCTGGTAGTGTAGGTCATTAGT-3′.Preparation of Cell-free Extracts—Cell samples were centrifuged (4000 × g for 5 min) and the pellet resuspended in protein extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm imidazole, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na3F, 0.2 mm Na3VO4 (pH 7.5) and supplemented with a protease inhibitor mix (CompleteTM, Roche Applied Science). The cells were homogenized at 6.0 m/s in a FastPrep FP120 homogenizer (Bio101, Savant) for 2 × 20 s. Cell debris was removed by a 15-min centrifugation at 14,000 × g.Gpd Enzyme Activity Assay—Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was assayed by addition of 200 μg of protein extract to 20 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm NADH. The reaction was started by the addition of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to 0.7 mm concentration in a final volume of 1 ml. The depletion of NADH was followed at 340 nm using a Beckman DU7400 spectrophotometer.Western Blot Analysis—To prepare cell extracts for SDS-PAGE and Western analysis cell samples were taken from exponentially growing cultures, transferred to liquid nitrogen and stored at –20 °C prior to analysis. Cell-free extracts were prepared as described above, and protein concentration was determined using the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad). A total of 100 μg of protein extracts was loaded per lane for SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). Western blot was performed using standard methods (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998Google Scholar). For detection of Gpd1p, rabbit anti-Gpd1p antibodies (diluted 1:2000) and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma) were used. Signal detection was achieved using the ECL-plus system (Amersham Biosciences), and analysis was performed using the Luminescent Image Analyser LAS-1000 plus (Fujifilm).Fluorescence Microscopy—Mid-log cells were observed using a Leica DMRXA microscope and green fluorescent protein was visualized using a GFP filter. Mitotracker (Molecular Probes) was added to the cell samples 10 min prior to observation using FITC filter.RESULTSAerobic Growth and Glycerol Production—To evaluate the roles of Gpd1p and Gpd2p under aerobic redox imbalance in S. cerevisiae, we first examined the growth phenotype and glycerol production of a series of W303 strains made prototrophic for growth factor requirements, i.e. wild-type, gpd1Δ, gpd2Δ, cox18Δ, gpd1Δcox18Δ, and gpd2Δcox18Δ. The strains were cultured in YNB glucose medium under aerobic conditions in high performance bioreactors. Respiratory insufficiency was achieved by deletion of the COX18 gene, encoding a protein involved in the assembly of the cytochrome c oxidase complex (33Souza R.L. Green-Willms N.S. Fox T.D. Tzagoloff A. Nobrega F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14898-14902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 34Saracco S.A. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 122-131Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cells lacking COX18 consumed glucose as the wild-type cells but were unable to use the ethanol that was produced during the glucose-consuming phase, while the respiratory competent wild-type cells continued to grow on ethanol upon depletion of glucose (Fig. 1, A and B). During aerobic growth on glucose the cox18Δ cells showed the same generation time as the wild-type cells as did the gpd1Δ and gpd2Δ mutants (Fig. 2). The gpd1Δcox18Δ mutant exhibited a decreased growth rate and the gpd2Δcox18Δ strain, which could be precultured on YNB glucose medium supplemented with amino acids, did not grow at all in the minimal YNB glucose medium. Since cox18Δ strains are unable to oxidize NADH by respiration, these strains experience physiological conditions similar to anaerobiosis. In agreement with this notion the cox18Δ mutant produced 5 times as much glycerol as wild-type cells, a production similar to that of wild-type cells cultured under anaerobic conditions (Figs. 1A and 3). Deletion of GPD1 in the cox18Δ background resulted in a slightly reduced aerobic growth rate and under these conditions the strain generated ∼80% of the glycerol produced by the cox18Δ single mutant (Fig. 3). These findings suggest a minor role for GPD1 in the aerobic redox-adjusting glycerol production of cox18Δ mutants. The observation that cox18Δ strains lacking GPD2 experience a complete growth arrest indicates that GPD2 is given a more important role for relieving the redox constraints in respiratory deficient mutants than reported for cells that are deprived of respiration due to anaerobic conditions (17Ansell R.

Under anaerobic conditions the wild-type, gpd1Δ and cox18Δ strains exhibited close to identical heat production (data not shown), growth rate (Fig. 2), and glycerol production (Fig. 3). The gpd1Δcox18Δ mutant showed improved growth and glycerol production under anaerobic versus aerobic conditions, displaying anaerobic growth characteristics similar to wild-type cells. This suggests that the slight contribution given by GPD1 to aerobic redox driven glycerol production is fully substituted by an increased contribution from GPD2. It is also clear that GPD2 is more important in respiratory-deficient mutants than in wild-type cells even under anaerobic conditions. Deletion of GPD2 in wild-type background results in an about 50% decrease in anaerobic glycerol production (Fig. 3), and growth rate (Fig. 2), as is previously reported (17Ansell R. Granath K.

To this end growth of the cells was followed in an aerobic bioreactor before and after the addition acetoin (1 g/liter). This supplementation offers an alternative route for NAD+ re-generation by reduction of acetoin to 2,3-butanediol (18Björkqvist S. Ansell R. Adler L. Lidén G. Appl. Environ.

Following acetoin addition growth of the gpd2Δcox18Δ strain resumed (Fig. 4), and a similar effect was seen in closed YNB glucose shaker cultures following the addition of acetaldehyde (not shown), another effective oxidizer of NADH. We then examined the effect of acetoin addition on growth and glycerol production for all strains when cultured in the bioreactor under anaerobic conditions. For these experiments acetoin was added prior to inoculation. Although growth of the wild-type, gpd1Δ, cox18Δ, and gpd1Δcox18Δ strains was not"

The extent of EGFR signaling is tightly regulated by post-transcriptional modifications leading to down-regulation of the levels of the receptor. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that the reactive oxidant hydrogen peroxide activates the EGFR, yet, without down-regulation of the receptor levels, which results in prolonged receptor signaling. In the present study we examined the role of the E3 ligase c-Cbl, as a possible link between oxidative stress, EGFR signaling, and tumorigenic responses. First, we ectopically expressed a mutant EGFR (Tyr-1045 → Phe) in cells lacking endogenous receptor, to determine whether the lack of phosphorylation at this site is the cause for EGFR retention at the membrane under oxidative stress, as we have previously suggested. Our findings suggest that abrogation of tyrosine 1045 phosphorylation alone is not enough to retain the EGFR at the plasma membrane under oxidative stress. Second, through the use of the Src inhibitor PP1, our findings establish EGFR movement out of the early endosomes as the exact location where c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitinylation is essential for EGFR trafficking. Finally, our studies substantiate the findings that c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitinylation is needed for degradation, but not for internalization of the EGFR in both transfection-dependent Chinese hamster ovary cells and transfection-independent A549 lung epithelial cells.

The length and intensity of these signals are controlled by several negative regulatory mechanisms (1Dikic I. Giordano S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), leading to complete signal inactivation by endocytosis and degradation of the receptor. Such a progression is required for eliminating constitutive signaling and tumorigenesis. Upon EGF binding, the EGFRs are rapidly internalized from the cell surface through numerous pathways, including clathrin-coated pits (2Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Internalized receptors are first associated with early endosomes, which then mature into late endosomes. In these bodies the EGFRs go through sorting and are either cycled back to the plasma membrane or targeted to the lysosomes for degradation (2Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 3Sorkin A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 4Dikic I. Biochem. Soc.

Multiple studies have established that the oncogenic potential of the EGF receptor is linked to its inability to undergo normal clathrin-mediated endocytosis and degradation (11Eccles S.A.

To elucidate molecular mechanisms linking oxidative stress, EGFR signaling, and tumorigenic responses, we studied the role of c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitinylation under oxidative stress. Upon mapping the EGFR phosphorylation sites, we found that phosphorylation at Tyr-1045, the docking site for c-Cbl, (8Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar) is abrogated under oxidative stress. Consequently, the EGFR fails to recruit the ubiquitin ligase, c-Cbl, and thus is not ubiquitinylated and is not degraded (15Ravid T. Sweeney C. Gee P. Carraway III, K.R. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31214-31219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We, therefore, suggested that this deficiency might have a key role in linking oxidative stress, the EGFR, and tumorigenesis by conferring prolonged receptor signaling at the plasma membrane. To gain a better understanding of how a receptor lacking c-Cbl binding may lead to tumorigenesis, we ectopically expressed a mutant EGFR (Tyr-1045 → Phe) in CHO cells to determine whether the lack of phosphorylation at this site is indeed the cause for prolonged EGFR retention at the membrane under oxidative stress. Our findings suggest that the inability of the EGFR to bind c-Cbl under oxidative stress is not solely due to its abrogated Tyr-1045 phosphorylation because the Y1045F mutant is still able to bind c-Cbl, probably indirectly via Grb2. Additionally, to establish the exact location where c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitinylation is essential for EGFR trafficking, A549 airway epithelial cells (natural EGFR expressers) were exposed to the Src inhibitor, PP1, which prevents EGFR ubiquitinylation. We identified EGFR movement out of the early endosomes as the precise site where EGFR ubiquitinylation is required. Finally, our studies substantiate the findings that c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitinylation is needed only for degradation, but not for internalization in both transfection-dependent CHO cells and transfection-independent A549 lung epithelial cells. Cell Culture—A549 human lung epithelial cells from ATCC (Manassas, VA) were maintained in F-12K (Kaighn's modification) nutrient mixture (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Prior to experiments, cells at 50-60% confluence were serum-starved overnight in F-12K medium containing 0.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. CHO-K1 cells were from ATCC and maintained in F-12 Ham's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Prior to experiments, cells at 50-60% confluence were serum-starved in F-12 Ham's medium containing 0.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. CHO cells were stably cotransfected with expression vectors for human c-Cbl and either the Y1045F mutant EGFR (both generously provided by Y. Yarden, Weizmann Institute, Israel) or WT EGFR, kindly provided by J. Schlessinger (Yale University). For other experiments, CHO cells were transiently transfected with either WT or mutant c-Cbl 381A expression vector (a generous gift from W. Y. Langdon, University of Western Australia). Treatments—H2O2 was generated by adding glucose oxidase (GO) (type II from Aspergillus niger, 15,500 units/g, Sigma) to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 25 mm glucose and 0.5% BSA. During experiments, cells were incubated for 15 min with medium that was pre-conditioned with GO for 15 min. For incubation periods greater than 15 min, GO-containing medium was replaced every 15 min with pre-conditioned medium. For EGF treatments, cells were incubated in the same medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml EGF (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Waltham, MA). c-Cbl ubiquitin ligase activity was inhibited using PP1. Serum-starved A549 cells were pretreated with 5 or 50 μm PP1 (Biomol, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA) for 30-45 min. Cells were then treated as noted in the presence of PP1. To regain c-Cbl ubiquitin ligase activity, cells were then washed three times with PBS, followed by the addition of medium containing only EGF. For inhibition of recycling, cells were preincubated for 40 min with 100 μm monensin (Sigma) and treated as described. Lysate Preparation, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting— Lysate preparation and protein immunoprecipitation were performed as described by Bao et al. (18Bao J. Alroy I. Waterman H.

After treatments, cells were extracted in solubilization buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and proteins in the lysate supernatants were immunoprecipitated by overnight incubation with the indicated antibodies at 4 °C, followed by protein A (Repligen Corp., Needham, MA) precipitation for 1-2 h. Precipitating antibodies used are as follows: anti-EGF receptor clone C225 (a generous gift from ImClone Systems Inc., New York, NY), anti-Grb2 clone C-23 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-c-Cbl clone C-15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with HNTG buffer, containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol, resolved by gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 0.5% Tween 20, 1% BSA, and 5% milk and then blotted overnight with primary antibodies followed by secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) linked to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive protein bands were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). Blotting antibodies used were as follows: anti-EGF receptor RK2 (kindly provided by Dr. J. Schlessinger); anti-phosphotyrosine PY-20, anti-Grb2 clone C-23, anti-Src, and anti-c-Cbl C-15 antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-ubiquitin antibody P4G7 from Covance (Princeton, NJ); anti-phospho-Akt serine 473 antibody, anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (p44/42 MAP kinase) antibody, anti-phospho-Src Tyr-416 (Cell Signaling, Inc.); and anti-Akt antibody and anti-ERK1/2 (p44/42 MAP kinase) antibody (Cell Signaling Inc.). Receptor Down-regulation—Serum-starved CHO cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml biotin-X-NHS (Calbiochem) dissolved in a borate buffer (10 mm boric acid, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) for 45 min at 4 °C. Biotin coupling was terminated by washing the plates with ice-cold PBS containing 15 mm glycine. Cells were then treated as indicated, after washing with room temperature PBS. Following treatments, proteins were lysed and immunoprecipitated using anti-EGFR C225 antibody. Protein biotinylation was detected by horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Calbiochem). The optical intensity of the corresponding bands was quantified using Image-QuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). Receptor Internalization—Serum-starved CHO cells were treated as indicated. Cells were then washed three times with cold PBS and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml biotin-X-NHS dissolved in a borate buffer (10 mm boric acid, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) for 45 min at 4 °C. Biotin coupling was terminated by washing the plates with ice-cold PBS containing 15 mm glycine, followed by three washes with cold PBS. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated using anti-EGFR C225 antibody. Protein biotinylation was detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Calbiochem). The optical intensity of the corresponding bands was quantified using ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (19Diamonti A.J. Guy P.M. Ivanof C. Wong K. Sweeney C. Carraway 3rd., K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were permeabilized for 10 min at room temperature with PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100, and then coverslips were blocked in 1% BSA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5% goat serum, and 0.02% sodium azide. Coverslips were then incubated for 1 h in primary antibody followed by 1 h in secondary antibody. Primary antibodies used were anti-EGFR clone 528 (kindly provided by Dr. John Mendelsohn, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY), anti-c-Cbl clone C-15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-EEA1 (BD Transduction Laboratories). The secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488 and 594 goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Additionally, in some experiments, Alexa Fluor EGF-488 or Alexa Fluor EGF-555 was used to treat cells (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using the ProLong® Antifade kit (Molecular Probes). Confocal microscopy at ×63 or ×100 magnifications was carried out by using a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal confocal microscope or a Leica TCS-SP laser scanning confocal microscope with an argon laser. H2O2Exposure and Tyr-1045 Mutation Confer Aberrant EGFR Degradation and Prolonged EGFR Signaling—We have recently demonstrated that activation of the EGFR by reactive oxidants such as H2O2 fails to enhance c-Cbl-mediated normal receptor down-modulation. We proposed that abrogated phosphorylation of Tyr-1045 of the EGFR is the basis for this aberrant down-regulation, and it is a result of the inability of c-Cbl to bind to the EGFR Tyr-1045 and to ubiquitinylate the EGFR. To address this possibility further, we utilized a mutant EGFR in which Tyr-1045 had been replaced by phenylalanine (Y1045F) (8Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I.

This mutant was co-transfected with c-Cbl into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and compared with the wild type (WT) EGFR. We investigated the fate of surface receptors by using the water-soluble, membrane-impermeant biotin-X-NHS, which labels accessible lysines of surface receptors (20von Boxberg Y. Wutz R. Schwarz U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Ravid T. Sweeney C. Gee P. Carraway III, K.R. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31214-31219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Biotinylation was followed by immunoprecipitation of the EGFR and Western blot analysis as detailed before (15Ravid T. Sweeney C. Gee P. Carraway III, K.R. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31214-31219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, WT EGFR-transfected cells exposed to EGF demonstrated a rapid drop in EGFR levels, whereas the Y1045F-transfected cells showed EGFR stability with unchanged levels at all detected time points up to 6 h of EGF treatment. Therefore, the cells containing the Y1045F mutant demonstrated a resistance to degradation, whereas the levels of the WT receptor dropped quickly in the presence of EGF. These results parallel our previous data that demonstrated that EGFR is resistant to degradation under H2O2 exposure (15Ravid T. Sweeney C. Gee P. Carraway III, K.R. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31214-31219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Given that the Y1045F mutant showed a similar degradation phenotype to that of the WT receptor under oxidative stress, we were interested in investigating whether this inhibition of degradation also paralleled the increase in length of EGFR signaling as seen under H2O2 exposure. CHO cells transfected with c-Cbl and the Y1045F mutant or WT EGFR were analyzed for Akt and ERK activation using anti-phosphorylation-specific antibodies in Western blot analysis. Transfection levels of the EGFR, Y1045F mutant, are detailed in Fig. 1C. After 2-h treatment with EGF or H2O2 (generated via glucose oxidase (GO)), EGFR, Akt, and ERK phosphorylation all remained significantly stronger in Y1045F-transfected cells than in cells expressing the WT EGFR and treated with EGF (Fig. 1B). These results are similar to those observed following exposure to H2O2 (Fig. 1B). Yet, the signaling through Akt and ERK was much stronger upon treatment of H2O2 at both time points. Because EGF was administered in levels that saturate EGFR binding capacity, it is possible that the additional H2O2 signaling activates Akt and ERK through a more complex mechanism than through the EGFR alone. Tyr-1045 Mutation Confers Slower Internalization of the EGFR—Because it was previously shown that EGFR activation under oxidative stress is not followed by c-Cbl-mediated receptor internalization and down-regulation (15Ravid T. Sweeney C. Gee P. Carraway III, K.R. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31214-31219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), our next question was whether the Y1045F mutant exposed to EGF would show a similar phenotype. Recent publications had suggested some discrepancies regarding Y1045F internalization (5Jiang X. Sorkin A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 529-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 6Mosesson Y.

Chem. 2003; 278: 28950-28960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) as described under “Discussion.” To quantify the amount of the EGFR remaining at the plasma membrane after treatments, a reverse biotinylation experiment was designed, using the principles of the degradation assay described above. Briefly, CHO cells co-transfected with c-Cbl and either the WT EGFR or with the Y1045F mutant were treated with EGF or H2O2 for the indicated time points, and then biotinylation of the surface receptors carried out. The EGFR levels were determined after cell lysis and immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 2A, fewer WT receptors treated with EGF remained available at the plasma membrane for biotinylation compared with the Y1045F mutant following EGF treatment or WT EGFR treated with H2O2. However, a slow decline in Y1045F receptor could also be observed over time, similar to the levels seen upon treatment with the WT receptor with H2O2, suggesting that this mutant receptor was still being internalized as revealed by confocal analysis (Fig. 2C). Yet, whereas a portion of the WT EGFR also disappeared from the plasma membrane under H2O2, only the receptors treated with EGF (both WT and Y1045F mutant) are co-localized with EEA1, an early endosomal marker (Fig. 2, B and C). As shown (Fig. 2A), the majority of EGFR ubiquitinylation was eliminated using the Y1045F mutant with no change in total ubiquitinylation (Fig. 1C). To confirm that any basal remaining level of ubiquitinylation was not due to c-Cbl ubiquitin ligase activity, we transfected CHO cells with the WT EGFR and either WT c-Cbl or a dominant negative c-Cbl (c-Cbl 381A) (21Thien C.B. Walker F. Langdon W.Y. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We found that, similar to the Y1045F mutant, the dominant negative c-Cbl-transfected CHO cells still showed EGFR internalization (Fig. 3D) despite the deficiency of c-Cbl-mediated receptor ubiquitinylation (Fig. 3A). These data are in agreement with Jiang and Sorkin's biochemical internalization studies of c-Cbl 381A-transfected HeLa cells (5Jiang X. Sorkin A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 529-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which demonstrate slower but definite EGFR internalization with c-Cbl 381A when compared with cells transfected with WT c-Cbl. Transfection with the dominant negative c-Cbl had no effect on total ubiquitinylation (Fig. 3B) but did result in prolonged downstream signaling of AKT upon EGF treatment (Fig. 3C), similar to cells transfected with the Y1045F mutant (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, confocal microscopy showed clear co-localization of both the Y1045F receptor with an early endosome marker (EEA1) (Fig. 2C) as well as the WT EGFR transfected with c-Cbl 381A (Fig. 3D), suggesting that not only were the receptors deficient in c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitinylation internalized, but that they were also able to reach the early endosomes. Therefore, it can be concluded from these data that c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitinylation of the EGFR is not needed for receptor internalization but is required for later events leading to degradation of the receptor. Tyr-1045 Mutation but Not H2O2Exposure Allows c-Cbl Binding to EGFR—To investigate the mechanism of EGFR resistance to degradation under oxidative stress and to explore further whether it is solely dependent on c-Cbl association with Tyr-1045, we compared the ability of the mutant and the wild type receptor to bind c-Cbl. Despite its inability to be phosphorylated at Tyr-1045, the Y1045F mutant was still associated with c-Cbl as shown in Figs. 1A and 4. Previously, we demonstrated that H2O2 exposure does not enhance Tyr-1045 phosphorylation and association between EGFR and c-Cbl (15Ravid T. Sweeney C. Gee P. Carraway III, K.R. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31214-31219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and as expected Fig. 4 shows that, upon H2O2 treatment, there was no EGFR co-localization with c-Cbl. We considered that the difference may be due to the ability of c-Cbl to bind EGFR not only via Tyr-1045, but also via the Grb2 adaptor (22Jiang X. Huang F. Marusyk A. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 858-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Indeed, through immunoprecipitation analysis we found that, under exposure to H2O2, although c-Cbl binds Grb2, the latter failed to associate with EGFR (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Grb2 fails to associate with both WT-EGFR and Y1045F mutant under H2O2 but remains associated with c-Cbl. CHO cells stably transfected with either c-Cbl and WT-EGFR or c-Cbl and the Y1045F mutant were serum-starved overnight, followed by incubation with 100 ng/ml EGF or 1 unit/ml GO for 30 min. The cells were then lysed, and EGFR or c-Cbl was immunoprecipitated (IP) from cell lysates using anti-EGFR C225 antibody or anti-c-Cbl, C-15, antibody, respectively. Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Grb2, C-23 antibody, or anti-EGFR, RK2 antibody, as indicated. Results are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Therefore, under H2O2 exposure, no c-Cbl binding to the receptor could be observed, whereas the Y1045F mutant could still be slowly associated with c-Cbl (see Fig. 1: binding of c-Cbl to the Y1045F mutant was observed only after 1 h of EGF treatment). But, in both cases, no c-Cbl-mediated EGFR ubiquitinylation could be observed (Fig. 2A). Despite c-Cbl association with the Y1045F mutant (probably via Grb2), the receptor was not ubiquitinylated (Fig. 2A), suggesting that, when bound only via Grb2, c-Cbl could not function as an E3 ligase of the EGFR, but may still serve as an adaptor protein for EGFR internalization. Activated c-Cbl Is Not Required for EGFR Entry into the Early Endosomes—Because under oxidative stress much of the EGFR remained localized at the plasma membrane and failed to co-localize with an early endosomal marker (Fig. 2B), it raised the question of whether c-Cbl might have a role not only as an E3 ligase, but also as an adaptor, which is essential for entry into the clathrin-dependent pathway through the early endosomes and is deficient under oxidative stress. The first question was whether c-Cbl had to be activated to allow internalization of EGFR, or if it simply could act as an adaptor protein, leading to internalization. For this purpose, we have utilized the Src kinase inhibitor, PP1, that was previousl"

Exposure of fibroblasts to exogenous gangliosides increases epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced fibroblast proliferation and enhances EGF receptor (EGFR)-mediated activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway (Li, R., Liu, Y., and Ladisch, S. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 42782–42792). Here we report that the EGFR itself is the target of this ganglioside effect: Preincubation of normal human dermal fibroblasts with GD1a ganglioside enhanced both EGF-induced EGFR autophosphorylation and receptortyrosine kinase activity. The enhancement was rapid (within 30 min), not due to alteration of time kinetics of the EGFR response to EGF, and reproduced in purified GD1a-enriched cell membranes isolated from ganglioside-preincubated fibroblasts. Evaluating the initial steps underlying activation, EGF binding, and EGFR dimerization, we found that GD1a enrichment of the cell membrane increased EGFR dimerization and the effective number of high affinity EGFR without increasing total receptor protein. Unexpectedly, GD1a enrichment also triggered increased EGFR dimerization in the absence of growth factor. This resulted in enhanced activation of the EGFR signal transduction cascade when EGF was added. We conclude that membrane ganglioside enrichment of normal fibroblasts (such as by tumor cell ganglioside shedding) facilitates receptor-receptor interactions (possibly by altering membrane topology), causing ligand-independent EGFR dimerization and, in turn, enhanced EGF signaling.

In our studies of normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF), ganglioside enrichment of cell membranes by incubation with several different exogenous gangliosides enhanced fibroblast proliferation and the EGF-induced signal transduction pathways, including increased EGFR autophosphorylation and Ras and MAP kinase activity as well as enhanced Src kinase activity (19Li R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34213-34223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Conversely, inhibition of cellular ganglioside synthesis, which depletes gangliosides from the ganglioside-enriched domain, blocked growth factor-mediated cell proliferation (25Li R. Manela J.

The mechanism by which ganglioside enrichment of the membrane enhances EGFR signaling is the subject of the present investigation. Here we show that GD1a ganglioside enrichment of the NHDF cell membrane enhanced growth factor-induced EGFR activity by increasing the effective number of EGFRs and by stimulating EGFR dimerization. Surprisingly, we discovered that GD1a enrichment caused significant EGFR dimerization even in the absence of the growth factor, creating a “primed” state of the fibroblast cell membrane, setting the stage for enhanced responsiveness to EGF. Materials—EGF (6 kDa mouse submaxillary glands, receptor grade) and Percoll were purchased from Sigma. EGF was reconstituted in serum-free medium as a stock solution, stored at –70 °C, and diluted directly before use. GD1a, GM1, and GM3 (Matreya, Pleasant Gap, PA) were dissolved in serum-free medium and diluted in the culture medium for each assay. AG1478 (Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, kept as a stock solution at –20 °C, and diluted directly into the culture medium in each assay (28Busse D.

Bis(sulfosuccinimide) suberate (bis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate)suberate; BS3), was purchased from Pierce. Phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody (rabbit polyclonal IgG), p44/42 MAP kinase antibody (rabbit polyclonal IgG), and phospho- and nonphospho-p44/42 MAP kinase control proteins were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. Anti-EGFR (sheep polyclonal IgG), rabbit anti-sheep IgG (horseradish peroxidase conjugate), anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and Tyr(P) (PY99) (mouse monoclonal IgG2b) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

The tyrosine kinase assay kit was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). [14C]GD1a (0.5 mCi/mmol) was a generous gift of Prof. Akira Hasegawa (Gifu University, Gifu, Japan). Cell Culture—NHDF purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) were cultured in fibroblast complete growth medium, FGM-2 (Clonetics), which contains 2% fetal bovine serum and 0.5 ml each of insulin, human fibroblast growth factor, and GA1000 per 500 ml. The culture medium was changed every 3 days. All experiments were performed using subconfluent cultures of passages 3–10. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion. For serum-free culture, fibroblast basal medium (FBM) was used. Preparation of Cell Lysate—1–2 × 105 NHDF were seeded per 100-mm dish or per well in 6-well plates in FGM-2. Upon reaching subconfluence, the cells were incubated with gangliosides in FBM for 6 or 18 h. Then the culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with FBM to remove unbound ganglioside and exposed to 2 ng/ml EGF in FBM for 5 min at 37 °C (29Iyer V.R. Eisen M.B. Ross D.T.

Then the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed for 20 min in lysis buffer, 1 ml/100-mm dish or 300 μl/6-well culture plate. The lysis buffer contained 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, sonicated briefly on ice, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was adjusted to 1 μg of protein/μl and used for the kinase assays. Proteins were quantified by the Lowry method using bovine albumin as a standard (30Lowry O. Rosenbrough N. Farr A.

Cell Preparation for the EGFR Inhibitor Assay—To test for the specificity of the effect of ganglioside preincubation on receptor autophosphorylation, the EGFR inhibitor, AG1478, was used. NHDF were exposed to GD1a in FBM for 18 h. During the last 3 h, 1 μm AG1478 or Me2SO was added (31Jo M. Stolz D.B. Esplen J.E. Dorko K. Michalopoulos G.K. Strom S.C. J. Biol.

Then the cells were exposed to 2 ng/ml EGF for 5 min and harvested, and the cell lysate was prepared as above. EGFR Autophosphorylation Assay—To preclear nonspecific binding, 200 μl of cell lysate (∼200 μg of total protein) were mixed with 100 μl of washed protein G-Sepharose-agarose bead slurry (50-μl packed beads), stirred for 2 h at 4 °C., and microcentrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 s. The supernatant was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube, mixed with 4 μg of sheep polyclonal IgG anti-EGFR antibody, and incubated overnight with gentle stirring at 4 °C. The immune complexes were recovered by adding 100 μl of the protein G-Sepharoseagarose bead slurry, gently rocking the mixture for 2 h at 4 °C, and microcentrifuging at 14,000 × g for 5 s. The supernatant was removed, the beads were washed 3 times with ice-cold lysis buffer, resuspended in 50 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and microcentrifuged. 20 μl of each supernatant (∼40 μg) protein was loaded onto a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. EGFR autophosphorylation was detected by Western blot using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody Tyr(P) (PY99) (19Li R. Liu Y. Ladisch S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42782-42792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and total EGFR was detected by an anti-EGFR antibody. Western Blotting—The sample was transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, incubated in 25 ml of blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, and then incubated with primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal IgG; 1:1000 dilution) with gentle agitation overnight at 4 °C. After 3 washes, the membrane was incubated in the medium containing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:2000). Proteins were detected by chemiluminescence and compared with standard proteins of different molecular weights. EGFR-tyrosine Kinase Activity—EGFR-tyrosine kinase activity was measured as the phosphorylation of an EGFR substrate peptide using a tyrosine kinase assay kit (Calbiochem). Briefly, the EGFR were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate (∼200 μg of protein). Half of the immunoprecipitated protein (10 μl) was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube that contained 20 μl of protein-tyrosine kinase reaction mix containing 30 μm ATP, 50 μm substrate peptide, 1 μCi of [32P]ATP, and 4 μlof10× protein-tyrosine kinase reaction buffer consisting of 200 mm magnesium chloride, 10 mm manganese chloride, 2 mm EGTA, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 80 mm imidazole hydrochloride, pH 7.3. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min with agitation. The reaction was stopped by placing the tubes on ice followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 s. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube containing 10 μl of stop solution mix (8 m guanidine hydrochloride) and briefly centrifuged. 8 μl of avidin solution was added to the supernatants, and the samples were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. 50 μl of wash solution and 20 μl of the reaction samples were transferred into the reservoirs of centrifugal ultrafiltration units, centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 × g, and washed 3 times with 100 μl of wash solution. The washed filters were transferred to scintillation vials, scintillation mixture was added, and radioactivity was quantified. Net cpm of 32P incorporated into the substrate peptide was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific binding of [32P]ATP from the total cpm. Phospho-p44/42 MAP Kinase Assays—Phosphorylation of p44/42 MAP kinase was determined by Western blot using the phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase antibody. A MAP kinase antibody was used to detect the total MAP kinase in each sample. Equal volumes of lysate and sample buffer were mixed, boiled for 5 min, vortexed, microcentrifuged for 2 min, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (12% gel) and Western blotting. Plasma Membrane Separation and in Vitro Assay of EGFR Autophosphorylation—NHDF were incubated with GD1a in FBM for 18 h. The plasma membranes were separated as previously described (32Smart E.J.

Briefly, after aspirating the medium, the cells were washed twice with the ice-cold buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tricine, pH 7.8), scraped into 3 ml of buffer A, centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A, and homogenized in a 2-ml Wheaton tissue grinder with 20 strokes. The cell homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A, homogenized, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The two supernatants were combined, layered on 30% Percoll in buffer A, and ultracentrifuged at 84,000 × g for 30 min, and the visible band was collected. These plasma membrane fractions were washed 3 times with HNG buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5), and the protein content was quantified. The resuspended pellets were assayed for EGFR activity (next paragraph). In Vitro EGFR Activity Assays—10 μg of protein of the plasma membrane preparation (15 μl) was mixed on ice with 15 μl of autophosphorylation buffer (HNG buffer containing 40 μm ATP, 30 mm MnCl2, and 400 mm Na3VO4). EGF was added to a final concentration of 2 ng/ml. Then the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with gentle agitation. The reaction was stopped by adding 30 μl of 2× lysis buffer, and the sample was stored on ice for 30 min. The samples were immunoprecipitated with the EGFR antibody (sheep polyclonal IgG), and the phospho-EGFR, total EGFR, and Tyr(P) kinase activities were tested as before. Plasma Membrane Binding of [14C]GD1a—To assess [14C]GD1a binding, cells were cultured in FBM with 3.5 × 105 cpm [14C]GD1a/well in a 24-well plate for 18 h. Then the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS, trypsinized, and harvested. The cell membranes were separated, and membrane-bound radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting. 125I-Labeled EGF Binding—Binding of 125I-labeled EGF to whole cells was assessed by modified Scatchard for 18 h analysis (33Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 57-74Crossref Scopus (17805) Google Scholar, 34Bremer E.G. Hakomori S. Bowen-Pope D.F. Raines E. Ross R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6818-6825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three parallel sets of 104 NHDF were grown for 24 h in a 96-well plate in FGM-2, washed twice with FBM, and incubated with 0, 5, or 10 μm GD1a in FBM for 18 h. One set of cells was then washed and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 0.5–20 ng/ml 125I-labeled human recombinant EGF in FBM without cold EGF to determine the total binding. The second set, used to test for nonspecific binding, was treated as above but with the addition of 300 ng/ml unlabeled EGF. After washing, 50 μl of lysis buffer were added to each well, the samples were lysed on ice for 30 min, and the cpm of 125I-labeled EGF in 20-μl aliquots were counted. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific binding of 125I-labeled EGF from the total binding. The third set of cells was trypsinized, and the cell number was determined. The binding curves and Scatchard analysis of the data were performed using GraphPad Prism 3.03 software. Assessment of EGFR Dimerization and Ligand-independent Dimerization—NHDF cells were cultured in 100 × 20-mm culture dishes and preincubated with GD1a in FBM for 18 h, washed, treated with (for dimerization) or without (for ligand-independent dimerization) 2 ng of EGF/ml in FBM for 5 min, and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. 3 ml of PBS containing 1 mg/ml BS3 were added, and the cells were incubated on ice for 30 min (35Qian X. LeVea C.M. Freeman J.K. Dougall W.C. Greene M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1500-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 36Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer for 20 min on ice. Total EGFR was immunoprecipitated with the EGFR antibody. 500 μg of lysate protein were loaded onto a 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and dimerization of the EGFR was detected by Western blotting using an anti-EGFR antibody. Data Analysis—All Western blots shown are the results of a representative experiment of 2–4 separate experiments. The optical density of protein bands on the Western blots was quantified using software from the Scion Corp, and the mean ± S.D. is shown in the bar graphs, with control levels set at 100 units. The -fold induction or percentage increase was calculated by comparing the differences of the means between control and treatment groups. Enhancement of EGFR Activation by GD1a Exposure of NHDF—Our previous findings that ganglioside preincubation of NHDF caused a concentration-dependent enhancement of EGF-induced fibroblast proliferation (25Li R. Manela J. Kong Y. Ladisch S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34213-34223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and of EGFR autophosphorylation (19Li R. Liu Y. Ladisch S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42782-42792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) led to the present investigations to determine how ganglioside enrichment of the cell membrane enhanced EGFR activity. In initial experiments we confirmed the effect of GD1a ganglioside on EGFR-mediated signaling in NHDF under the same conditions as those used in our previous studies (19Li R. Liu Y. Ladisch S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42782-42792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). That is, after an 18-h preincubation of NHDF with 20 μm GD1a in serum-free FBM, the cells were washed to remove unbound ganglioside and exposed to EGF (2 ng/ml) for 5 min in FBM. Under these conditions GD1a preincubation enhanced EGF-induced EGFR autophosphorylation by ∼70% without affecting the total EGFR level (Fig. 1A). The specific inhibitor of EGFR autophosphorylation AG1478 (1.0 μm), added during the last 3 h of the preincubation with GD1a, blocked both the EGF-induced and the GD1a-enhanced, EGF-induced EGFR autophosphorylation (Fig. 1A), demonstrating the specificity of the ganglioside effect on EGFR autophosphorylation. These overall findings were confirmed in three separate experiments (Fig. 1B). A major EGF-induced signaling pathway is that of EGFR activation of Ras, which in turn activates Raf, MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase), and MAPK. Because MAPK plays an important role in cell proliferation (37Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of GD1a on the activation of p44/42 MAPK. Under the same conditions that caused enhanced cell proliferation and enhanced EGFR autophosphorylation, 20 μm GD1a preincubation enhanced the EGF-induced phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK in NHDF by 65%, whereas the total MAPK level was unchanged. This increased MAPK phosphorylation was also inhibited by exposure of the cells to 1.0 μm AG1478, further confirming the specificity of the ganglioside effect as being EGF-mediated (Fig. 1C) as well as excluding a direct activating effect of GD1a downstream of the EGFR. Three additional separate experiments measuring the enhancing effect of GD1a and the inhibitory effect of AG1478 on MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 1D) confirmed these results. Enhanced EGFR Activation in Isolated NHDF Membranes by GD1a Preexposure—To establish whether the ganglioside effect was linked specifically to a membrane interaction, NHDF were preincubated with GD1a in FBM for 18 h as above, and then the plasma membranes were isolated. The isolated plasma membranes were exposed to EGF in FBM for 5 min and then lysed. The EGFRs were immunoprecipitated with the anti-EGFR antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using the phosphotyrosine antibody, Tyr(P) (PY99). As seen in the Western blot of a representative experiment (Fig. 2A) and in the composite results of three experiments analyzed by densitometry (Fig. 2B), NHDF preincubation with 5–20 μm GD1a enhanced EGF-induced EGFR autophosphorylation in the isolated membranes in a concentration-related manner, with a 91% increase in EGFR autophosphorylation in membranes of cells that had been preincubated with 20 μm GD1a (Fig. 2B). The enhanced EGFR autophosphorylation found after GD1a enrichment both in intact cells and in isolated membranes localizes the ganglioside effect on EGFR phosphorylation to the plasma membrane. Enhancement of EGFR-tyrosine Kinase Activity by GD1a Exposure—As a second experimental approach to confirm the enhancement of EGFR activation that we detected as enhanced autophosphorylation, we measured tyrosine kinase activity of the EGFR by measuring phosphorylation of a substrate peptide (38Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 39Schaefer E.M. Guimond S. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 100-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) after an 18-h preincubation of NHDF cells in 10 or 20 μm GD1a and then a 5-min exposure to 2 ng/ml EGF. The EGFR tyrosine kinase activity in the intact cells (Fig. 3A) and in membranes isolated from these GD1a-pretreated cells (Fig. 3B) was quantified after immunoprecipitation of EGFR with the EGFR antibody. EGFR-tyrosine kinase activity was detected in NHDF after EGF stimulation, and ganglioside enrichment of the membrane enhanced this activity. After preincubation with 20 μm GD1a, EGF-induced tyrosine kinase activity was increased both in whole cells (47%, Fig. 3A) and in isolated membranes (60%, Fig. 3B). Of note, GD1a itself did not enhance EGFR-tyrosine kinase activity, which excludes a direct activating effect of GD1a on EGFR signaling. Plasma Membrane Binding of Exogenous [14C]GD1a Ganglioside—To link the above enhancement directly to an effect of the ganglioside, we determined whether GD1a bound to the cell membrane. We exposed NHDF to 5 μm [14C]GD1a ganglioside for 18 h (as above), separated the plasma membranes, isolated and purified the membrane gangliosides, and quantified the membrane-bound radiolabeled GD1a. Approximately 0.15 ± 0.01% of the added [14C]GD1a was bound to the NHDF membranes, reflecting binding of 5.0 ± 0.1 × 106 molecules/cell, thus clearly documenting GD1a enrichment of the NHDF membranes. Kinetics of EGFR Autophosphorylation—The dependence of enhanced EGFR autophosphorylation on the duration of GD1a preincubation was determined by incubating subconfluent NHDF for 5 min up to 6 h with 20 μm GD1a in FBM. Then the cells were washed and incubated with EGF (2 ng/ml) for 5 min. Western blotting showed a substantial and maximal increase in EGFR autophosphorylation after only a 30-min pretreatment of the cells with GD1a (Fig. 4). Longer incubations maintained the same level of enhanced (∼2-fold) receptor autophosphorylation. To assure that the enhancement did not reflect simply an alteration of the timing of the peak level of activation, we quantified the effect of GD1a preincubation on the time course of EGF stimulation (Fig. 5). NHDF cells were preincubated with 20 μm GD1a in FBM for 18 h, washed, and then exposed to 2 ng/ml EGF in FBM for 5–30 min. Stimulation of the cells with EGF rapidly activated the EGFR (5 min), with a return to nearly base-line levels after 30 min. The magnitude (but not the time course) of activation was altered when cells were preincubated with GD1a; EGFR phosphorylation was enhanced over the entire 30-min time course of EGFR activation, with the greatest enhancing effect o"

To overcome this technical obstacle, we have developed a method to express multimeric integral membrane proteins in extracellular (budded) baculovirus particles that are released from Sf9 cells co-infected with multiple transmembrane proteins. We applied this method to the reconstitution of γ-secretase, a membrane protease complex that catalyzes the intramembrane cleavage of β-amyloid precursor protein to release Aβ peptides, the major component of amyloid deposits in Alzheimer brains as well as of Notch. When we co-infected Sf9 cells with human presenilin 1 (PS1), nicastrin, APH-1a, and PEN-2, a high-molecular-weight membrane protein complex that contained PS1 exclusively in its fragment form associated with three other cofactor proteins was reconstituted and recovered in a highly γ-secretase-active state in budded virus particles, whereas nonfunctional PS1 holoproteins massively contaminated the parental Sf9 cell membranes. The relative γ-secretase activity (per molar PS1 fragments) was concentrated by ∼2.5 fold in budded virus particles compared with that in Sf9 membranes. The budded baculovirus system will facilitate structural and functional analyses of γ-secretase, as well as screening of its binding molecules or inhibitors, and will also provide a versatile methodology for the characterization of a variety of membrane protein complexes.

A wide variety of protein expression systems using heterologous organisms have been applied to the structural and functional analyses of multispan membrane proteins. However, overexpression and recovery of membrane proteins in a biologically active state are often hampered by the following problems. First, a significant proportion of overexpressed proteins tend to misfold and aggregate without forming proper tertiary structures. Second, lack of appropriate post-translational modifications, interaction with binding-partner proteins, or proper intracellular transport render the membrane proteins stuck within the early compartments of intracellular membrane trafficking. Furthermore, serious contamination of biologically inactive, nascent, or misfolded proteins is inevitable, which makes the analysis of the functional form of protein difficult.The infection of recombinant baculovirus into Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells (Sf9) is one of the most widely used methodologies that achieves a high level of expression and yield of recombinant membrane proteins (1Massotte D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1610: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).

Recently, it has been reported that a seventh membrane-spanning, G protein-coupled receptor was successfully recovered in BV in a functional form complexed with heterotrimeric G proteins and adenylyl cyclase (2Loisel T.P.

Using this strategy, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP) and SREBP cleavage-activating protein, which are endoplasmic reticulum-resident membrane proteins in mammalian cells, also were displayed on BV particles with a lesser extent of aggregation and degradation compared with those in cellular membrane fractions (4Urano Y. Yamaguchi M. Fukuda R. Masuda K. Takahashi K. Uchiyama Y. Iwanari H. Jiang S.Y. Naito M. Kodama T. Hamakubo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, selective reconstitution of a protein complex composed of multiple integral membrane proteins in a biologically active state has not been achieved yet.γ-Secretase is a membrane-bound protease complex composed of at least four transmembrane proteins, i.e. presenilin (PS), which is predicted to harbor the catalytic center as an aspartic protease, as well as nicastrin (NCT), APH-1, and PEN-2 as essential transmembrane cofactor proteins (5Wolfe M.S. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 6De Strooper B. Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase is responsible for the intramembrane cleavage of a subset of type 1, single-span membrane proteins (7Haass C. Steiner H. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), including β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP), to form amyloid β peptides (Aβ); Aβ is the major component of amyloid deposits in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease and is closely linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (8Selkoe D.J. Kopan R. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 565-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Another important substrate of γ-secretase is Notch, the intracellular domain (ICD) of which is released by γ-secretase and enters the nucleus, thereby transducing intercellular information during tissue development and renewal through transactivation of gene expression (8Selkoe D.J. Kopan R. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 565-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the four putative γ-secretase components in mammalian or Drosophila cells led to the maturation of γ-secretase protein complex, i.e. endoproteolysis of PS to generate fragments (the amino-terminal fragment and the carboxyl-terminal fragment, respectively) and high-molecular-weight (HMW) complex formation, as well as an up-regulation of the proteolytic activity (9Hu Y. Fortini M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 10Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T. Yu C. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol.

Nature. 2003; 422: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Importantly, overexpression of all four components in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which lacks endogenous γ-secretase activity, successfully reconstituted the γ-secretase activity (13Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that a membrane protein complex composed of these four proteins represents the minimal framework of γ-secretase.Selective recovery and purification of the active form of γ-secretase complex is essential to its functional and structural characterization, although a majority of exogenously overexpressed PS polypeptides remain inactive in the low-molecular-weight complex that chiefly contains PS holoprotein, presumably because of lack of binding with other essential cofactor proteins (14Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28415-28422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar).

Previous studies showed that endoproteolysis of PS is associated with the acquisition of γ-secretase activity in mammalian cells (5Wolfe M.S. Nat. Rev.

Immunoblot analysis of Sf9 membrane fractions showed a robust expression of PS1 polypeptide chiefly in a holoprotein form (Fig. 2A, left lane), which is known to be γ-inactive and which was in agreement with previous reports (24Octave J.N.

Immunoblot analysis showed that PS1 underwent endoproteolysis to generate an amino-terminal fragment and a carboxyl-terminal fragment corresponding to the size of mammalian PS1 fragments only when all four components were infected, although a major proportion of recombinant PS1 polypeptide remained as a holoprotein (Fig. 2A, right lane). In contrast, PS1 fragments were hardly generated upon expression of PS1 plus one or two of the cofactor proteins (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that any two of the components among PS1 (holoprotein as well as fragments), NCT, APH-1a, or PEN-2 were coimmunoprecipitated in Sf9 membranes that expressed the four components (data not shown).We then analyzed the BV fractions from Sf9 cells infected with combinations of the four components by immunoblotting. In contrast to Sf9 cell membranes, PS1 polypeptides accumulated almost exclusively in the fragment forms, together with NCT, APH-1a, and PEN-2 in the BV fractions, only when all four components were infected (Fig. 2A, right lane). Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that amino-terminal fragment and carboxyl-terminal fragment of PS1 were associated as a heterodimer and formed a protein complex with NCT, APH-1, and PEN-2 in a similar manner to that in mammalian cells (Fig. 2B). We next fractionated the Sf9 membranes and BV particles solubilized in CHAPSO by size-exclusion chromatography in 0.25% CHAPSO containing buffer, a condition in which solubilized membranes exhibit γ-secretase activity. Under this condition, PS1 fragments and γ-secretase activities in HeLa membranes were separated in fractions >1 megadalton, as described previously (26Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). 2I. Hayashi, Y. Urano, R. Fukuda, N. Isoo, T. Kodama, T. Hamakubo, T. Tomita, and T. Iwatsubo, unpublished data. Immunoblot analysis of the eluates of Sf9 cells and BV revealed that fragment forms of PS1 as well as other components were predominantly separated in fractions of HMW ranges >1 megadalton (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained by glycerol velocity centrifugation (Fig. 1S). These data suggest that recombinant γ-secretase components undergo complex formation in Sf9 cells infected by baculovirus in a similar manner to that in mammalian cells, and that the HMW complex associated with PS1 fragments, but not a holoprotein, is selectively accumulated on BV particles.Characterization of Reconstituted γ-Secretase Activity in Vitro in Sf9 Cell Membranes or on BV—To characterize the endogenous and reconstituted γ-secretase activities in Sf9 cells, we solubilized the Sf9 membranes with 1% CHAPSO and incubated them with the recombinant C100 substrate in vitro (12Takasugi N.

We did not detect any de novo generation of Aβ peptides from the recombinant substrate in mock-infected Sf9 membranes, even in the presence of phosphatidylcholine (Fig. 3A, left), which increases in vitro γ-secretase activity in solubilized mammalian membranes (27Kimberly W.T.

Kodama, T. Hamakubo, T. Tomita, and T. Iwatsubo, unpublished observations. Some γ42-secretase activity was observed, but this activity was not sensitive for γ-secretase inhibitors (see below). This was in agreement with the observation that Sf9 cells do not harbor an endogenous γ-secretase activity (24Octave J.N. Essalmani R. Tasiaux B. Menager J. Czech C. Mercken L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1525-1528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 25Pitsi D. Kienlen-Campard P. Octave J.N. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Overexpression of combinations of any three components did not reconstitute γ-secretase activities to elicit de novo Aβ generation in vitro (data not shown), whereas overexpression of all four components exhibited a dramatic up-regulation of the proteolytic activity in Sf9 cell membranes (Fig 3A). Interestingly, Aβ42 was the predominantly generated Aβ species relative to Aβ40 when we used Sf9 cells as an enzyme source, and the percentage of Aβ42 as a fraction of de novo generated total Aβ amounted to ∼60%. We next analyzed the γ-secretase activity in CHAPSO-solubilized BV particles from multiply infected Sf9 cells and observed a robust Aβ-generating activity in the BV fraction from cells infected with all four components. These activities were ∼10-fold higher than that detected in mammalian HeLa cell membranes, the latter harboring the highest level of endogenous γ-secretase activity in mammalian cells (Fig. 3B) (17Takahashi Y. Hayashi I. Tominari Y. Rikimaru K. Morohashi Y. Kan T. Natsugari H. Fukuyama T. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18664-18670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Similarly to the results in Sf9 membranes, Aβ42 was again the predominant species in de novo generated Aβ (%Aβ42: mean ± S.E., 65.5 ± 7.1%). Coincubation with γ-secretase inhibitors, L-685,458 or DAPT, abolished the activity reconstituted in BV fractions (Fig. 3C). Notably, reconstituted γ42-secretase activity was less sensitive to L-685,458 at 100 nm concentration (65.2% inhibition), which completely abolished the γ-secretase activity in the HeLa membrane, whereas DAPT potently inhibited the γ42-secretase activity (94.0% inhibition; residual activity was almost equivalent to that in mock-infected BV). These results indicate that γ-secretase activity can be reconstituted in Sf9 cells and BV associated with robust γ42-cleavage activity by overexpression of all four components of human γ-secretase, as shown previously in other organisms (9Hu Y.

In contrast to cTPxI protein, cTPxII is not abundant and is highly inducible by peroxides. Here, we describe a unique phenotype for ΔcTPxII strain; these cells were highly sensitive to tert-butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) but presented resistance to H2O2 in fermentative and respiratory conditions. In contrast, ΔcTPxI strain was very sensitive to both TBHP and H2O2, whatever the carbon source present in the media. These differences in the response of mutant cells to the different kinds of peroxide insult could not be attributed to enzymatic properties of cTPxI and cTPxII since the recombinant proteins showed similar in vitro efficiencies (Kcat /Km) in the removals of both kinds of peroxide. This specific sensitivity of ΔcTPxII cells to TBHP could not be related to the expression pattern of TSA2 (cytosolic thioredoxin peroxidase II gene) either, since this gene is highly inducible by both H2O2 and TBHP when cells were grown in different conditions.

Cells possess multiple pathways to detoxify peroxides. In the case of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are five peroxiredoxins (a class of thiol-dependent peroxidases) located in different cell compartments; two catalases (one peroxisomal and one cytosolic) and one cytochrome c peroxidase (a mitochondrial heme-dependent protein) (for review see Refs. 1Jamieson D.J.

In addition, three phospholipid glutathione peroxidases have been recently characterized, although their cellular locations are still unknown (3Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol.

It is reasonable to assume that each peroxide-removing enzyme plays a particular role in cell protection against oxidative stress, which can be defined by its cellular location, substrate specificity, and expression pattern among other factors. In regard to substrate specificity, catalase T (cytosolic) and catalase A (peroxisomal) can only decompose H2O2 (Reaction 1), whereas thiol-dependent peroxidases can reduce both organic hydroperoxide and H2O2 (see Reaction 2 below; when R2 = H, R2OOH = H2O2; when R2 = alkyl; R2OOH = alkyl hydroperoxide (5Chae H.Z.

This microorganism is also suitable for oxidative stress studies because it can grow both anaerobically or in the presence of high oxygen tension. Moreover, the kind of carbon source present in the medium provokes dramatic effects on yeast biochemistry and physiology. Through various signaling pathways, glucose represses several genes involved in respiration and in mitochondrial biogenesis (12.Gelade, R., Van De Velde, S., Van Dijck, P., and Thevelein, J. M. (2003) http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/11/233,Google Scholar). The expression of several antioxidant enzymes is also repressed by glucose, but in some cases this effect is only slight (for review, see Refs. 1Jamieson D.J. Yeast. 1998; 16: 1511-1527Crossref Scopus (632) Google Scholar and 13Moradas-Ferreira P. Costa V. Redox Rep. 2000; 5: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). At high glucose levels mitochondria are present with few cristae that are not well developed (14Pon L. Schatz G. Broah J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 333-406Google Scholar), and as a consequence, this organelle is not very active. On the other side, when glucose is consumed from the culture medium, yeast undergoes great physiological and biochemical changes to produce ATP mainly by oxidative phosphorylation, and consequently, more reactive oxygen species are generated. Therefore, by changing the carbon source in the media, bioenergetics of yeast is profoundly affected. Expression of peroxiredoxins is also affected by glucose in yeast (15Demasi A.P.D. Pereira G.A.G.

Here, we have analyzed the expression pattern of cTPxII and the viability of ΔcTPxII cells under several conditions. Additionally, the enzymatic properties of recombinant cTPxI and cTPxII were investigated in detail. Our results indicated that cTPxII and cTPxI, among other antioxidants, are key components of yeast defense against stress induced by organic peroxides independent of the carbon source present in the media. Moreover, biochemical assays performed in cell extracts indicated that catalase cooperate with peroxiredoxins in the protection of yeast against H2O2 insult. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—S. cerevisiae yeast strains used in this study were BY4741 (Mat a; His3Δ1; Leu2Δ0; Met15Δ0; Ura3Δ0), ΔcTPxI (Mat α; His3Δ1; Leu2Δ0; Lys2Δ0; Ura3Δ0; YML028W::Kan Mx4), and ΔcTPxII (Mat a; His3Δ1; Leu2Δ0; Met15Δ0; Ura3Δ0; YDR453C::Kan Mx4) and were obtained from EUROSCARF (www.uni-frankfurt.de/fb15/mikro/euroscarf/index.html). Cells were grown at 30 °C in complete synthetic medium (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingstone R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.A. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 4.9.2-4.9.8Google Scholar) containing glucose, glycerol, or raffinose as carbon sources. For most analysis, except when expression of the TSA2 gene was tested at different phases of growth, cells were collected at the mid-logarithmic phase, usually at A600 nm = 0.8. To obtain high amounts of cells adapted to growth under glycerol or raffinose as the carbon source, pre-cultures were grown overnight in glucose, harvested, and transferred to the respective media. Cells were then cultivated for 8 h in glycerol or raffinose-containing media. This condition was sufficient to induce yeast adaptation from a fermentative to a respiratory condition (16Monteiro G. Pereira G.A.G. Netto L.E.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Determination of Peroxide Tolerance—Tolerance of yeast cells to H2O2 or to TBHP was determined by the spot test as described below. Inoculates were obtained from cells that were grown overnight in complete synthetic media with 2% glucose. In the case of the experiments conducted in fermentative conditions, inoculates were diluted to A600 nm = 0.2 on the next day. Afterward, yeast was grown until cell density reached a value equivalent to A600 nm = 0.8. Finally, cell cultures were diluted again to A600 nm = 0.2, and then four subsequent 1:5 dilutions of these cell suspensions were performed. A 10-μl droplet of each dilution was plated onto complete synthetic medium plus agar with glucose 2%. For experiments in respiratory conditions, inoculates were diluted in synthetic media containing glycerol with a cell density equivalent to A600 nm = 0.8. Cells were then cultivated for 8 h in glycerol-containing media and then diluted to A600 nm = 0.2. Four subsequent 1:5 dilutions of these cell suspensions were performed. A 10-μl droplet of each dilution was plated onto complete synthetic medium plus agar with glycerol 2% and glucose 0.1%. When glucose or glycerol was used as the carbon source, plates were incubated for 30 or 48 h, respectively. Peroxides were added to plates at the concentrations indicated in the figures. Northern Blot Analysis—All the procedures were according to the membrane manufacturer's protocol and as described by Ausubel et al. (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingstone R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.A. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 4.9.2-4.9.8Google Scholar). In summary, analyses were conducted on total yeast RNA extracted from cells under distinct growth conditions by hot acid phenol method (15Demasi A.P.D. Pereira G.A.G. Netto L.E.S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Monteiro G. Pereira G.A.G. Netto L.E.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and separated by electrophoresis on formaldehydeagarose gels. The fractioned RNAs were transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary blotting and fixed. Probed membranes were exposed to Kodak films (X-Omat). For probe preparation, a 600-bp NdeI/BamHI fragment containing the TSA2-coding sequence was isolated from plasmid pPROEX/TSA2. Plasmid DNA preparation, gel electrophoresis, and purification were all carried out using standard methods. The resulting purified fragment was used to construct the TSA232P-labeled probe by random-primed labeling. Ribosomal RNA, whose abundance was fairly constant under different growth conditions or among strain derivatives, was used as a loading control (15Demasi A.P.D. Pereira G.A.G. Netto L.E.S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Monteiro G. Pereira G.A.G. Netto L.E.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The amount of rRNA in each well was determined by the fluorescence of ethidium bromide bound to this nucleic acid and by nucleic acid absorbance at 260 nm (1 A260 nm = 40 μg/ml RNA). Construction of Expression Vectors for cTPxI, cTPxII, Trr1, and Trx1—TSA2 was PCR-amplified from yeast genomic DNA using the following forward 5′-TATCATATGGTAGCAGAAGTTCAAAAACAAGCC-3′ and reverse 5′-TAGGATCCTTAATTATTGGCATTTTTG-3′ primers. The underlined bases represent the NdeI and BamHI sites, respectively. The PCR product was cloned into the pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega), resulting in the pGEM/TSA2 plasmid. An Escherichia coli DH5-α strain was transformed with pGEM/TSA2, and white colonies were selected from LB-ampicillin-X-gal (X-gal: 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside) medium. Plasmid extraction was performed using the Rapid Plasmid Miniprep System Concert kit (Invitrogen). p-PROEX (Invitrogen) and pGEM/TSA2 were first digested with NdeI and then with BamHI. Both p-PROEX and pGEM/TSA2 digestion products were extracted from an agarose gel using the Rapid Gel Extraction Concert kit (Invitrogen), and the TSA2 fragment was ligated to the digested p-PROEX expression vector. The resulting p-PROEX/TSA2 plasmid was sequenced with an Applied Biosystems ABI Prism 3700 apparatus to confirm that the construction was correct. An E. coli DH5-α strain was transformed with p-PROEX/TSA2, and it was used for cTPxII expression and purification. Expression vectors for Trr1, Trx1, and cTPxI were similarly constructed after their genes were cloned into NdeI and BamHI restriction sites of pPROEX, pET17b (Novagen), and pET15b (Novagen) expression vectors, respectively. Protein Expression and Purification—The E. coli DH5-α strain transformed with p-PROEX/TSA2 or with p-PROEX/TRR1 were cultured (50 ml) overnight in LB plus ampicillin medium (100 μg/ml), transferred to 1 liter of fresh LB plus ampicillin medium and cultured until the A600 reached 0.6–0.8. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added at a final concentration equivalent to 1 mm. After 3 h of incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was washed and suspended in the start buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with 500 mm NaCl). Two sonication cycles of 30 s (35% amplitude) followed by 30 s on ice were applied to the cell suspension. The cell extract was then kept on ice during treatment with 1% streptomycin sulfate for 15 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 31,500 × g for 30 min to remove nucleic acid precipitates and cell debris. cTPxI and Trx1 were expressed by similar protocols, but Bl21(DE3) strain was used as the host instead of DH5-α strain. Cell extracts containing bacteria that expressed cTPxI, cTPxII, or Trr1 were applied to a Hi-trap nickel-affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) or Talon cobalt-affinity resin (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). When Talon cobalt-affinity resin was used, the start buffer was changed to 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5 with 100 mm NaCl. The conditions for protein purification were optimized using the gradient procedure for imidazole concentration as described by the manufacturer. Trx1 was purified by boiling bacterial extracts as described previously (24Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of Thioredoxin-dependent Peroxidase Activity—Thiol-dependent peroxidase activities of cTPxI and cTPxII were measured by NADPH oxidation assay. NADPH oxidation was monitored at A340 nm (Hitachi Model U-2001 Spectrophotometer) in 1-ml reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 100 μm DTPA, 1 mm azide, 0.225 μm Trx2, 0.075 μm Trr1, 2.1 μm cTPxII, and 0.18 mm NADPH. The reaction was started by the addition of 10–100 μm peroxide solution, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by their absorbance at 280 nm. The extinction coefficients for cTPxI (ϵ280 = 22800 m–1 ·cm–1) and for cTPxII (ϵ280 = 26150 m–1·cm–1) were obtained through ProtParm tool (bo.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html). Km and Vmax were calculated by the Lineweaver-Burk equation (the double-reciprocal plot of Michaelis-Menten equation). Kcat was obtained by dividing Vmax by the peroxiredoxin concentration. No decrease of A340 nm was observed when Trr1, Trx1, or peroxiredoxin was omitted from the reaction mixture in any of the conditions analyzed. Determination of Peroxide Consumption by Soluble Cell Extracts— Cells were grown at 30 °C in complete synthetic medium (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingstone R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.A. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 4.9.2-4.9.8Google Scholar) containing 2% glucose. When cells reached a density equal to A600 nm = 0.8, they were harvested by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was washed and suspended in 400 μl of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl buffer containing 2 μg/ml leupeptin and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. Glass beads were added at the same volume of the sample. Two cycles of 6 min of vortex after 6 min on ice were applied to cell suspension. The suspension was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min. Supernatants were collected and centrifuged again at 16,000 × g for 30 min to remove protein precipitates. The supernatants were collected for assay. The remaining peroxide contents present in the supernatants were determined at different intervals by the ferrous oxidation xylenol orange assay as described previously (25Jiang Z.-Y. Hunt J.V. Wolff S.P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by the addition of peroxide compounds and stopped at different intervals by the addition of 200 μm HCl to the reaction mixtures. H2O2 concentration in stock solutions was checked by its absorbance at 240 nm (ϵ240 nm = 43.6 m–1·cm–1). The amounts of proteins in yeast cell extracts were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad protein assay kit II) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Conditions used to measure H2O2 or organic hydroperoxide consumptions were markedly distinct and are indicated under “Results” (“Peroxide Removal Activities in Soluble Cell Extracts”). Catalase Assays—Yeast cell extracts were obtained as described in the previous section. Oxygen release due to catalase activity (see Reaction 1) in cell extracts was specifically determined using Clark electrode at 30 °C (Yellow Springs Instrument Co.). The saturating oxygen concentration, which corresponds to the full scale of the electrode, was taken to be 0.225 mm (26Robinson J. Cooper J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 33: 339-349Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Role of cTPxII in Cell Protection against Peroxide Insult— Previous results indicate that deletion of the cTPxII gene renders cells more sensitive to peroxide insult, but the effect observed was only slight (21Wong C.M. Zhou Y. Ng R.W. Kung H.F. Jin D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5385-5394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Here, a very systematic study was performed by testing several peroxide concentrations, cell dilutions, and the effect of the carbon source on the protective role of cTPxII because of the well known catabolic repression exerted by glucose (for review, see Ref. 12.Gelade, R., Van De Velde, S., Van Dijck, P., and Thevelein, J. M. (2003) http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/11/233,Google Scholar). Cells were grown in synthetic medium to avoid the reaction of peroxides with extracellular components present in a rich medium such as glutathione (27Maris A.F. Assumpção A.L. Bonatto D. Brendel M. Henriques J.A. Curr. Genet. 2001; 39: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because rich media are not so well controlled as synthetic media, reproducibility problems may occur when experiments are performed with different lots of components. Using this approach a pronounced sensitivity of ΔcTPxII cells to TBHP treatment was found in both glucose (preferentially fermentative) and glycerol (respiratory-supportive only)-containing media (Fig. 1). In glucose, at 1 mm TBHP concentration, wild type and mutant strains were similarly sensitive (Fig. 1). When higher concentrations of TBHP were added to the solid medium, both ΔcTPxI and ΔcTPxII cells were found to be much more sensitive than wild type cells. At 1.2 mm concentrations of TBHP, wild type cells growth was observed up to the 1:125 dilution, whereas ΔcTPxI and ΔcTPxII cells had a significant growth only up to 1:5 dilution. Therefore, under these conditions wild type cells were at least an order of magnitude more resistant to TBHP than mutant strains (Fig. 1). These results indicated that both cTPxI and cTPxII, among other antioxidants, are required to protect wild type S. cerevisiae from TBHP treatment at doses higher than 1 mm. cTPxI and cTPxII also appeared to be very important for cell protection against TBHP treatment in glycerol as a carbon source. Under these conditions the physiology of yeast is profoundly altered since several genes are repressed by glucose (14Pon L. Schatz G. Broah J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 333-406Google Scholar). Again, at TBHP doses lower than 1 mm, no significant decrease in viability was observed for ΔcTPxI or ΔcTPxII cells (data not shown). However, deletion of TSA1 or TSA2 rendered yeast cells more sensitive to TBHP at higher concentrations (Fig. 1). These results indicated that both cTPxI and cTPxII were important for yeast protection against TBHP under fermentative and respiratory conditions. A systematic investigation was also performed to find a condition where ΔcTPxII cells might show clear sensitivity to H2O2. Several conditions were tested, and no clear sensitivity of ΔcTPxII cells to H2O2 was found when yeast was grown in both glucose- and glycerol-containing media (Fig. 2). In fact, in some conditions ΔcTPxII cells appeared to be even more resistant to H2O2 than wild type strain (e.g. cells grown in glucose and treated with 1.5 mm H2O2). In contrast, a considerable effect was observed for ΔcTPxI cells exposed to H2O2 at 1.2 and 1.5 mm concentrations, especially under glucose-repressing conditions (Fig. 2). The data shown in Figs. 1 and 2 are representative of at least three independent experiments performed under the same conditions. In summary, the results presented so far indicated that both cTPxI and cTPxII are important for cell protection against TBHP. Analysis cTPxII Expression—A possible explanation for the specific sensitivity of ΔcTPxII cells to organic peroxide insult could be related to the pattern of TSA2 expression, in case this gene might be induced at higher levels by organic peroxide than by H2O2. Therefore, a series of Northern blot experiments were conducted to analyze TSA2 expression in wild type cells. No TSA2 transcript was detected, in any condition tested, when cells were not exposed to peroxides. However, the addition of peroxides even at very low concentrations (0.1 mm for H2O2 and 0.3 mm for TBHP) induced strong expression of TSA2 (Fig. 3). In contrast, cTPxI is a very abundant protein in the absence of peroxides and is only slightly induced by these oxidants (15Demasi A.P.D. Pereira G.A.G. Netto L.E.S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Kim K. Kim I.H. Ki Lee.-Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 5385-5394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the probe used in our Northern blot experiments was very specific for the TSA2 gene, since no band was detected in ΔcTPxII cells exposed to 0.3 mm peroxide for 15 min (Fig. 3). The dose-response expression pattern of TSA2 was very similar for cells exposed to H2O2 or TBHP. Therefore, these results could not explain the specific sensitivity of ΔcTPxII cells to organic peroxides. Consequently, TSA2 expression was also analyzed as a function of time. Maximal TSA2 expression was achieved at about 30 min of peroxide treatment followed by a sharp decrease at 60 min of treatment (Fig. 4). Again, the time dependence of TSA2 expression was very similar after treatments of cells with H2O2 or TBHP in both glucose- or glycerol-containing media (Fig. 4). Only the induction of TSA2 by H2O2 in cells grown on glucose differed slightly from the pattern described above. In this case, maximal expression was achieved at 15 min instead of 30 min (Fig. 4A). The expression of TSA2 was also analyzed in cells grown in media containing other carbon sources and other concentrations of glucose. As described above, transcripts were only detected when cells were treated with peroxides (Fig. 5A). Finally, expression of TSA2 was measured as a function of growth phase. At later phases of growth, a low amount of transcripts could be detected in the absence of peroxides, but levels of TSA2 transcript increased greatly after peroxide treatment (Fig. 5B). The much higher induction of TSA2 by peroxide treatment than induction by glucose exhaustion is in agreement with previous reports (22Hong S.K. Cha M.K. Choi Y.S. Kim W.C. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12109-12117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 28Wong C.M. Ching Y.P. Zhou Y. Kung H.F. Jin D.Y. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Enzymatic Properties of Recombinant cTPxII—Because specific sensitivity of ΔcTPxII cells to TBHP could not be attributed to the pattern of TSA2 induction by peroxides, the enzymatic properties of cTPxII were also analyzed. We hypothesized that cTPxII might be much more efficient in the removal of organic peroxides than in decomposition of H2O2. It was reported before that the enzymatic activity of cTPxII is higher for H2O2"

Although responsible for the majority of transmembrane transport in bacteria, they are relatively uncommon in eukaryotic mitochondria. Organellar trafficking and import, in addition to quaternary structure assembly, of mitochondrial ABC transporters is poorly understood and may offer explanations for the paucity of their diversity. Here we examine these processes in ABCB10 (ABC-me), a mitochondrial inner membrane erythroid transporter involved in heme biosynthesis. We report that ABCB10 possesses an unusually long 105-amino acid mitochondrial targeting presequence (mTP). The central subdomain of the mTP (amino acids (aa) 36–70) is sufficient for mitochondrial import of enhanced green fluorescent protein. The N-terminal subdomain (aa 1–35) of the mTP, although not necessary for the trafficking of ABCB10 to mitochondria, participates in the proper import of the molecule into the inner membrane. We performed a series of amino acid mutations aimed at changing specific properties of the mTP. The mTP requires neither arginine residues nor predictable α-helices for efficient mitochondrial targeting. Disruption of its hydrophobic character by the mutation L46Q/I47Q, however, greatly diminishes its efficacy. This mutation can be rescued by cryptic downstream (aa 106–715) mitochondrial targeting signals, highlighting the redundancy of this protein's targeting qualities. Mass spectrometry analysis of chemically cross-linked, immunoprecipitated ABCB10 indicates that ABCB10 embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane homodimerizes and homo-oligomerizes.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3350) Google Scholar). Their function ranges from peptide transport to phospholipid flipping to anion channel formation. Members of the ABC transporter superfamily have been implicated in numerous human diseases (including cystic fibrosis (CFTR/ABCC7), adrenoleukodystrophy (ALDP/ABCD1), Zellweger's syndrome (PMP70/ABCD3), progressive familial intra-hepatic cholestasis (SPGP/ABCB11), and Stargardt macular dystrophy (ABCR/ABCA4)) (2Holland B. Cole S.P.C. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins: From Bacteria To Man. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego2003Google Scholar). The basic structure of ABC transporters is relatively well conserved and includes a hydrophilic ATP binding cassette and a hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain (3Schmitt L. Tampe R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Whereas the large members of the family contain two of each domain, the “half-transporters” contain one of each and are predicted to dimerize (3Schmitt L. Tampe R. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Mammalian ABC transporters are found predominantly in the plasma membrane but are also known to play essential roles in a number of organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisome, and the mitochondrion (2Holland B.

Accordingly, their involvement in the pathophysiology of acquired and inherited forms of sideroblastic anemias has been suggested and, in the case of ABCB7, already demonstrated. Only eight mitochondrial ABC transporters have been described to date (7Lill R. Kispal G. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This is remarkable, given that in bacteria, ABC proteins are the most diverse family of transporters, numbering well over 50 in Escherichia coli. Since mitochondrial ABC transporters are synthesized in the cytosol, they require proper trafficking, import, and assembly to achieve functionality in their target organelle. Two dominant mitochondrial import pathways have been described, each involving specialized import machinery and distinct signals (13Chacinska A. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 299-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). One pathway recognizes a cleavable, N-terminal mitochondrial targeting presequence (mTP) and is generally utilized by hydrophilic proteins. The second pathway, employed by the membrane metabolite carrier class of proteins, is used by more hydrophobic proteins bearing internal targeting signals. mTPs, although they lack a consensus primary sequence, share a number of common characteristics. They are rich in arginine residues, feature a net positive charge, and possess amphiphilic α-helices (14Horwich A.L. Kalousek F. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4930-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 16Schwarz E. Neupert W. Biochim.

Additionally, some mTPs include a short hydrophobic motif that is recognized by Tom20, a component of the mitochondrial import machinery on the outer membrane (18Duby G. Oufattole M. Boutry M.

Biol. 2003; 328: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). mTPs lead their preproteins into the matrix in a linear configuration, where they are cleaved off by the mitochondrial processing peptidase, allowing for final assembly of the mature protein in one of the mitochondrion's compartments (20Gakh O. Cavadini P. Isaya G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Proteins of the metabolite carrier class do not possess a cleavable presequence (21Voos W. Martin H. Krimmer T. Pfanner N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 235-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22Kurz M. Martin H. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2461-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Rather, they bear three internal targeting modules that cooperatively bind to Tom70. These proteins are transported in a loop configuration directly into the inner membrane, where they assume their functional structure (23Wiedemann N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). ABC half-transporters include a ∼200-amino acid hydrophilic ATP binding cassette and a ∼400-amino acid hydrophobic transmembrane domain. Therefore, these proteins might present a challenge to mitochondrial import machinery. This study marks the first comprehensive analysis of the mitochondrial targeting, import, and assembly properties of an ABC transporter. We have previously reported on the murine mitochondrial transporter, ABCB10 (ABC-me). ABCB10 is induced during erythroid differentiation and is involved in heme biosynthesis (8Shirihai O.S. Gregory T. Yu C. Orkin S.H. Weiss M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2492-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We report here that the ABCB10 preprotein includes an unusually long mTP of 105 residues that provides mitochondrial targeting redundancy and flexibility. Point mutation experiments reveal that ABCB10 additionally possesses downstream (aa 106–715) targeting signals capable of assisting a damaged mTP. To differentiate between protein trafficking and protein import, we combined confocal microscopy of living cells and biochemical analysis of isolated organelles. We show that removing part of the mTP of ABCB10 results in efficient trafficking but compromised import into the mitochondria. Quaternary structure analysis of ABCB10 indicates that it homo-oligomerizes in the mitochondrial inner membrane and does not appear to assemble with other proteins. ABCB10 that lacks its mTP is targeted not to mitochondria but to the ER, where it also oligomerizes. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293T and COS cells were cultured in low glucose DMEM without phenol red (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% standard fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and antibiotics at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. G1ER cells (24Gregory T. Yu C. Ma A. Orkin S.H. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 87-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 units/ml Epoetin α (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA), 0.5% Chinese hamster ovary kit ligand (stem cell factor) conditioned medium (100 units/ml), and antibiotics. Transient transfections of HEK 293T cells and COS cells were performed using FuGene 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were <15% confluent at transfection. Transfection efficiency was ∼70%. Plasmids and DNA Constructs—The 105-aa mTP of mouse ABCB10 and its five wild-type subdomains (aa 1–35, 36–70, 71–105, 1–70, and 36–105) were prepared by PCR using primers containing an EcoRI restriction site followed by a Kozak initiation sequence at the 5′-end and a BamHI restriction site at the 3′-end, using ABCB10 as template. Single amino acid mutations were performed by triple PCR, with multiple mutations achieved with additional rounds. Amplified fragments were digested and cloned into pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) with T4 DNA ligase (Roche Applied Science) using the EcoRI (5′) and BamHI (3′) restriction sites upstream to EGFP. Deletion constructs were also prepared by PCR. All constructs were validated by sequencing at the core facility at either Children's Hospital or Tufts University (Boston, MA). Labeling of the Mitochondria and Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), Confocal Microscopy, and Data Analysis—Mitochondria were labeled using the mitochondria-specific dyes tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester perchlorate (TMRE) and Mitotracker Red CMH2Xros from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Freshly prepared TMRE was added to culture in Me2SO (Fisher) at 50 nm and incubated for 10 min prior to visualization. Cells were kept in the dark and examined for a maximum of 15 min. Mitotracker Red was applied to culture at 100 nm, also in Me2SO. The cells were incubated for 30 min and washed twice in warm culture medium. Mitotracker Red was used to verify the precise mitochondrial labeling of TMRE. The ER was labeled using the ER-specific dye ER-Tracker™; blue-white DPX (E-12353) at a concentration of 100 nm as directed by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes). Confocal microscopy was performed on live cells in glass slide bottom dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta microscope with a × 63 oil immersion objective at 37 °C. Using multitrack analysis, red-emitting mitochondrial dyes were excited with a 543-nm helium/neon laser, and emission was recorded through a BP 650–710-nm filter. EGFP was excited using a 488-nm argon laser, and emission was recorded through a BP 500–550-nm filter. ER-Tracker blue-white DPX (E-12353) was excited with a two-photon laser, and emission was recorded through a BP 435–487-nm filter. The correlation plot application of Metamorph image analysis software version 5.0 was employed for colocalization quantification and generation of scatter plots. 12–24 cells from a minimum of 8–12 colonies were analyzed per condition. Colocalization was analyzed for individual cells identified as regions of interest. They were averaged for each condition to determine a mean mitochondrial correlation coefficient (MMCC), and the S.E. was calculated. Relative significance of data sets was determined by a standard t test with the threshold set at p < 0.05. Isolation of Mitochondria—Crude mitochondria were prepared by differential centrifugation as described (8Shirihai O.S. Gregory T. Yu C. Orkin S.H. Weiss M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2492-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Density gradient purification was performed using OptiPrep™; as directed by the manufacturer (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway). The Bradford assay was used to spectrophotometrically determine the protein concentration using a NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-visible spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Rockland, DE). Protein Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation—1,5-Difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DFDNB; Pierce) dissolved in Me2SO was used as the cross-linking reagent at a concentration of 30 μg/30 μg of protein for low level and 300 μg/30 μg of protein for high level cross-linking. Gradient-purified mitochondria were suspended in 150 mm KCl and incubated in DFDNB at 0 °C for 30 min. The reaction was quenched at 25 °C for 30 s with 400 mm Tris base (pH 9). Cross-linking was also performed on whole cell lysate using a modified protocol in which the cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with Complete™; EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen to break the membranes. Cross-linking was performed as stated above, with the addition of 120 μg/ml DNase I (Roche Applied Science) during quenching. Immunoprecipitation was performed using Protein G-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) and anti-V5 (1:500 dilution) (Invitrogen) and anti-c-Myc (1:500 dilution) (Invitrogen) antibodies as described (25Hjelmeland L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). One-dimensional SDS-PAGE, Silver Staining, and Western Blotting—Mitochondrial samples were taken up in sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, bromphenol blue), loaded on a 4–15% gradient Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad), and electrophoresed at 160 V in running buffer using a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean 3 cell. Proteins to be identified by MS/MS analysis were revealed by silver staining using the Silver Stain Plus kit (Bio-Rad). For detection by Western blotting, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a Bio-Rad TransBlot SD rapid transfer cell in Towbin buffer at 140 mA for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were anti-EGFP (1:2500 dilution) (Clontech) and anti-V5-horseradish peroxidase (1:5000 dilution) (Invitrogen). Protein was revealed using a Super Signal chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase detection system as directed by the manufacturer (Pierce) and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Mass Spectrometry and N-terminal Sequencing—Protein identification of SDS-PAGE silver-stained bands was done by MS/MS analysis of tryptic peptides using the MS-fit program as previously described (26Wilcox S.K. Cavey G.S. Pearson J.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 3046-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). N-terminal protein sequencing was performed by automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems model 494 Procise sequencer. Samples separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained with Coomassie Blue. Model 610A version 2.1 software was employed for data acquisition and processing. Proteinase K Digestion of Extramitochondrial Proteins—Extramitochondrial protein digestion was carried out to verify complete mitochondrial insertion of each mTP and its passenger protein. It was performed on all constructs that targeted partially or entirely to mitochondria. Those constructs that targeted to mitochondria but were not fully imported are mentioned under “Results.” To accomplish extramitochondrial protein digestion, gradient-purified mitochondria were incubated with 100 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) on ice for 30 min. Proteinase K was subsequently inactivated using a modified procedure described by Glick (27Glick B.S. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Pierce) was added, and the mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation at 17,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Mitochondria were resuspended in buffer C (0.6 m sorbitol (Fisher), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 2× Complete™; protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5.5% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid (Sigma), heated to 70 °C for 5 min, and then incubated on ice for an additional 5 min. Mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min and immediately resuspended in sample buffer for separation by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. 2 m Tris, pH 9, was added dropwise to neutralize the solution. Whole Cell Protein Analysis—Whole cell protein analysis was performed to control for post-translational stability of transfected constructs. The procedure was carried out on all constructs that did not target to mitochondria. Those constructs that were cleaved prior to mitochondrial targeting, thus reducing targeting efficiency, are mentioned under “Results.” For whole cell protein analysis, cells were lysed in buffer C, supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) SDS and 2 μm pepstatin A (Roche Applied Science) to prevent protein degradation. Protein was then precipitated using 5.5% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid and immediately separated by SDS-PAGE. Identification of ABCB10 Presequence Cleavage Site— ABCB10 fused to V5 at its C-terminal was expressed in HEK 293T cells, immunoprecipitated, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Silver staining revealed a band at ∼65 kDa (Fig. 1A). This band was subjected to tryptic fragment analysis by tandem mass spectrometry and was identified as ABCB10, with the fragments obtained indicating that a larger than expected portion of the N terminus could be missing (data not shown). N-terminal sequencing performed on the band identified the first 17 amino acids as LGNDSQRRPAATGRSEV, which correspond to ABCB10 aa 106–123 (Fig. 1B). The 105-aa mTP of ABCB10 is unusually long compared with the mean mTP length of 34 residues ± 17 (one S.D.) (28Emanuelsson O. von Heijne G. Schneider G. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 175-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mTP of ABCB10 Is Necessary for Mitochondrial Import of ABCB10 and Sufficient for Import of EGFP—To explore the mitochondrial targeting and import properties of ABCB10 and its mTP, EGFP was fused at their C termini, and the proteins were expressed in HEK 293T cells. Their colocalization with mitochondria stained with TMRE was analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2). Metamorph image analysis software generated per-pixel scatter plots of red and green signal intensities. The MMCC is a measure of the scatter plot's tendency for positive linear correlation. Thus, a value of +1 represents perfect mitochondrial colocalization, 0 represents no mitochondrial preference, and -1 represents perfect mitochondrial exclusion. Since HEK 293T fibroblasts grow in adherent colonies, cells were selected from at least 12 colonies to minimize the impact of clonal variation. EGFP has been employed previously for similar subcellular localization studies (18Duby G. Oufattole M. Boutry M. Plant J. 2001; 27: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Ma Y. Taylor S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27328-27336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). EGFP alone is cytosolically localized and shows no organellar preference (Fig. 2E). EGFP carries consecutive negative charges at residues 6E and 7E of the EGFP molecule. Concentrated negative charge is highly unfavorable to mitochondrial targeting (16Schwarz E. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is believed that C-terminal EGFP fusion does not enhance mitochondrial targeting of a molecule. As expected, ABCB10-EGFP co-localizes with mitochondria, giving an MMCC of 0.81 ± 0.02 (Fig. 2A). The mTP of ABCB10 alone also targets EGFP to the mitochondria, demonstrating its sufficiency as an mTP. The MMCC for aa 1–105-EGFP is 0.81 ± 0.02 (Fig. 2B). To ensure that these proteins were fully imported into mitochondria, in addition to their being trafficked to the mitochondrial surface, biochemical analysis of their position was performed. Density gradient-purified mitochondria were isolated from HEK 293T expressing the protein of interest. Mitochondria were then subjected to proteinase K digestion of extramitochondrial proteins, and the results were analyzed by Western blotting. Western blots of aa 1–105-EGFP pre- and postdigestion were identical, indicating that complete import was accomplished (data not shown). This validation procedure was carried out on all subsequently examined constructs that targeted to mitochondria (see “Experimental Procedures”). Removal of the mTP from ABCB10-EGFP drastically reduces mitochondrial targeting, resulting in an MMCC of Δ105-ABCB10-EGFP of 0.33 ± 0.03 (Fig. 2C). For experimental control, mitochondrial targeting was additionally calculated for EGFP C-terminally fused to a standard, commercially available mTP, subunit VIII of human cytochrome c oxidase (Clontech), and EGFP alone (Fig. 2, D and E). The negative MMCC for EGFP alone indicates that it avoids mitochondria. To ensure that the failure of Δ105-ABCB10-EGFP to target to mitochondria was not due to post-translational cleavage, cell lysate was prepared and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-EGFP. All Δ105-ABCB10-EGFP that was detected appeared at an apparent molecular weight consistent with the predicted value (data not shown). This procedure was carried out on all subsequently examined constructs that failed to efficiently target to mitochondria (see “Experimental Procedures”). Removal of the mTP Results in the Mistargeting of ABCB10 to the ER—Δ105-ABCB10-EGFP does not appear ubiquitously in the cytoplasm but rather is identified as a meshlike structure characteristic of the ER membrane (Fig. 2C). Cells expressing Δ105-ABCB10-EGFP were co-stained with the ER-specific dye ER-Tracker blue-white DPX (E-12353) and subjected to ER colocalization quantification according to the same technique as mitochondrial colocalization (Fig. 2F). Δ105-ABCB10-EGFP is targeted into the ER with high efficiency, suggesting that an alternative subcellular distribution of ABCB10 or isoforms of ABCB10 may exist. Subcellular localization of Δ105-ABCB10 was additionally examined in COS cells, yielding identical ER preference (data not shown). Fragmentation of the mTP of ABCB10 and Identification of a Critical Targeting Region—The primary amino acid sequence (Fig. 1B) and predicted secondary structure of the mTP of ABCB10 were examined for features characteristic of mTPs. The distribution of both positive charge and hydrophobic moment (a measure of amphiphilicity) along the mTP of ABCB10 follows a pattern that delineates three distinct subdomains (Fig. 3, A and B). Similarly, the three putative α-helices are dispersed one per subdomain (Fig. 1B). To investigate underlying independent functionality of the three subdomains, fragmentation and mutation experiments were performed. The mTP was divided into three 35-aa fragments: aa 1–35, 36–70, and 71–105. The two negatively charged residues of the mTP of ABCB10 are located in positions 35 and 105, the C-terminal residues on the first and third fragments, respectively. Their proximity to EGFP minimizes their effect on the targeting properties of the mTP. Since the average length of all confirmed mTPs is 34 aa, the targeting efficiency of the fragments is not compromised by mTP length alone (28Emanuelsson O. von Heijne G. Schneider G. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 175-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, examination of the targeting of the mTP fragments offers insight into the inherent properties in each region. The central 35 aa of the mTP of ABCB10 is more effective at targeting EGFP to mitochondria than the flanking subdomains (Fig. 3). aa 1–35 and 71–105 only partially target EGFP to the mitochondria (MMCC of 0.50 ± 0.04 and 0.50 ± 0.05, respectively). aa 36–70 targets EGFP to the mitochondria as efficiently as the entire mTP of ABCB10 (Figs. 2B and 3D). aa 1–70, which is expected to target to mitochondria well, has a low MMCC of 0.27 ± 0.05 (data not shown). However, Western blot analysis of cell lysate found that the protein is unstable (Fig. 3H). Ambiguous cleavage events free EGFP from the rest of the protein, thereby causing EGFP to localize to the cytoplasm. A similar process occurred when aa 36–70 alone was N-terminally fused to Δ105-ABCB10-EGFP to determine the capacity of the isolated central subdomain of the mTP to target ABCB10 to the mitochondria. The resulting protein was unstable in both HEK 293T cells and COS cells (data not shown). Functional Analysis of aa 1–35: Evidence for a Role in the Translocation of ABCB10 across Mitochondrial Membranes— The N-terminal subdomain of the mTP, aa 1–35, is not essential for the trafficking of ABCB10 to mitochondria. Both aa 36–105-EGFP and Δ35-ABCB10-EGFP are brought to the mitochondrial surface (Fig. 3, F and G). Western blot analysis suggested, however, that Δ35-ABCB10-V5 is not fully inserted into mitochondria despite reaching their outer membranes. Western blot analysis of density gradient-purified mitochondria was carried out on cells expressing either ABCB10-V5 or Δ35-ABCB10-V5. Wild-type ABCB10-V5 appears as a major band corresponding to the molecular weight of the mature protein from which the mTP has been cleaved (Fig. 3I). When SDS-PAGE is performed within 24 h post-transfection, a faint, higher molecular weight band corresponding to the approximate weight of the immature, uncleaved protein is present (as seen in Fig. 1A). Δ35-ABCB10-V5 appears as two bands of nearly equal strength, indicating that a substantial fraction of the protein is left uncleaved. Sinc"

The homeodomain transcription factors Cdx1 and Cdx2 regulate intestine-specific gene expression and enterocyte differentiation. Their roles in regulating proliferation are recognized but remain poorly understood. Previously, we demonstrated that Cdx1 expression diminished the proliferation of human colon cancer cells in part by reducing cyclin D1 gene expression. In order to elucidate further the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we first hypothesized that Cdx1 or Cdx2 expression reduces colon cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting β-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) transcriptional activity. We report that Cdx1 or Cdx2 expression does inhibit β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity in colon cancer cells. This inhibitory effect is dose-dependent and is observed in different colon cancer cell lines, and the degree of inhibition correlates with the ability of Cdx1 to reduce cell proliferation. Cdx1 expression does not alter β-catenin protein levels or intracellular distribution nor does it induce an inhibitory TCF isoform. We also find that Cdx1 expression is lost in Min mouse polyps with increased nuclear localization of β-catenin, suggesting that Cdx1 does not support β-catenin-mediated transformation. Finally, we show that colon cancer cells effectively reduce Cdx2-mediated inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity when compared with other model systems. This suggests that colon cancer and possibly crypt epithelial cells can modulate the effects of Cdx2 on β-catenin signaling and proliferation.

In the United States, over 150,000 people are newly diagnosed with this disease each year, and a third of them will ultimately die from their disease. Many investigations over the years have determined the sequence by which most colorectal cancers arise from normal epithelium. It involves the progression along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence (1Lynch J.P. Hoops T.C. Hematology. 2002; 16: 1-36Google Scholar, 2Chung D.C. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 854-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Colorectal cancers arise from adenomas, which are dysplastic but nonmalignant precursor lesions in the colon. Progression along this pathway to cancer occurs through the accumulation of multiple somatic mutations, ultimately leading to malignant transformation and the formation of an invasive colon cancer.One of the most critical genes mutated in the progression to colorectal cancer is the adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC) 1The abbreviations used are: APC, adenomatosis polyposis coli; TCF, T-cell factor; LEF, lymphoid-enhancing factors; TRE, TCF-responsive elements; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: APC, adenomatosis polyposis coli; TCF, T-cell factor; LEF, lymphoid-enhancing factors; TRE, TCF-responsive elements; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. tumor suppressor. APC mutations occur early and with great frequency in sporadic colon cancer. Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, as well as the Min mouse phenotype, are due to germ line transmission of a mutant APC allele (3Powell S.M. Petersen G.M. Krush A.J. Booker S. Jen J. Giardiello F.M.

APC has many proposed functions, including the regulation of the Wingless (Wnt) signaling pathway (4Barker N. Clevers H.

In the unstimulated state, free β-catenin is rapidly recruited from the cytoplasm and the nucleus by APC into a multiprotein complex, actively phosphorylated, and targeted for destruction via the ubiquitin/proteosome pathway (5Bienz M.

Huls G. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). Although these mice die shortly after birth, it was noted that they experience a complete failure of proliferation in the stem-cell compartment of their small intestine. More severe developmental defects were recently reported for the TCF4–/–/TCF1–/– double knockout mice (17Gregorieff A. Grosschedl R. Clevers H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1825-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest the β-catenin/TCF complex plays a critical role in regulating intestinal epithelial cell development and proliferation.Development and differentiation of the intestinal epithelium are also regulated in part by the activity of the homeodomain proteins Cdx1 and Cdx2 (18Guo R.J.

Observations from a number of laboratories suggest these factors can regulate epithelial cell proliferation. There is evidence that Cdx2 expression reduces intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and behaves like a tumor suppressor (21Suh E. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 26Aoki K. Tamai Y. Horiike S. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. Nat.

Gut. 2003; 52: 1465-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, the role of Cdx1 in the control of intestinal cell proliferation is less well understood.Cdx1 is expressed in the intestinal crypts, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling is required for Cdx1 expression (28Subramanian V. Meyer B. Evans G.S. Differentiation. 1998; 64: 11-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Lickert H. Domon C. Huls G. Wehrle C. Duluc I. Clevers H. Meyer B.I. Freund J.N. Kemler R. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 3805-3813PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a role for Cdx1 in promoting proliferation. However, Cdx1 expression is preferentially silenced with the progression to colon cancer in humans (30Silberg D.G. Furth E.E. Taylor J.K. Schuck T. Chiou T. Traber P.G. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 478-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 31Suh E.R. Ha C.S. Rankin E.B. Toyota M. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 227: 35795-35800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar), casting doubt on the premise that Cdx1 promotes proliferation. In our previous studies (19Keller M.S. Ezaki T. Guo R.J. Lynch J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: G104-G114Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32Lynch J. Keller M. Guo R. Yang D. Traber P.G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4499-4506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we used inducible or transient methods to express Cdx1, and we observed that Cdx1 expression inhibited cell proliferation. We determined this was due to Cdx1-mediated inhibition of G1 cyclin-dependent kinase activity. Cyclin D1 mRNA and protein levels were diminished by Cdx1 expression, and overexpression of cyclin D1 inhibited the G0/G1 block. Finally, cyclin D1 mRNA stability studies, time course analyses, and cyclin D1 promoter studies suggested that Cdx1 acts to diminish cyclin D1 gene transcription rather than utilizing post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms that have been described for cyclin D1 (34Guo Y. Stacey D.W. Hitomi M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7545-7556Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 35Diehl J.A. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2002; 1: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar).Here we analyze in greater detail the molecular basis of Cdx1- and Cdx2-mediated inhibition of colon cancer cell proliferation. We noted that cyclin D1 has been implicated as a transcriptional target of β-catenin/TCF, and we hypothesized that Cdx1 expression reduced cyclin D1 gene expression by modulating β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity. We establish that Cdx1 and Cdx2 expression does inhibit β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity. This inhibitory effect is dose-dependent and can be observed in a number of different colon cancer cell lines. Moreover, the degree to which Cdx1 inhibits β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity correlates with the ability of Cdx1 to reduce cell proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Cdx1 expression can inhibit β-catenin/TCF-mediated inductions of cyclin D1 and Cdx1 promoter activity. Cdx1 expression does not alter β-catenin protein levels or intracellular distribution nor does it induce an inhibitory TCF isoform. We also find that despite the observation that the Cdx1 gene 2CDX1 and CDX2 indicate human genes or proteins; Cdx1 and Cdx2 indicate mouse genes or proteins or species not specified.2CDX1 and CDX2 indicate human genes or proteins; Cdx1 and Cdx2 indicate mouse genes or proteins or species not specified. is a Wnt/β-catenin/TCF transcriptional target, Cdx1 expression is lost in Min mouse polyps with increased nuclear localization of β-catenin. Finally, we show that colon cancer cells effectively reduce Cdx2-mediated inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity as compared with other cells and model systems. This suggests that colon cancer and possibly crypt epithelial cells can modulate Cdx2's effect upon β-catenin signaling and proliferation. We conclude that Cdx1 and Cdx2 inhibit colon cancer cell proliferation by blocking β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture, Adenoviral Infection, and Transfections—DLD1, HT-29, SW480, 293-T, and HCT116 cells were obtained from the ATCC or the Cell Center (University of Pennsylvania). The cells were all maintained as recommended by the ATCC. Adenovirus infections were performed as described (32Lynch J. Keller M. Guo R. Yang D. Traber P.G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4499-4506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The multiplicity of infection yielding >90% of cells expressing Cdx1 had been determined previously (32Lynch J. Keller M. Guo R. Yang D. Traber P.G.

Guo R. Yang D. Traber P.G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6395-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and was used in these experiments. At 48 h postadenoviral infection, the cells were processed for the various end points including protein and RNA isolation.293-T cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). DLD1, HCT-116, and HT-29 cells were transfected by electroporation as described (32Lynch J. Keller M. Guo R. Yang D. Traber P.G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6395-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 36Krasinski S.D. Van Wering H.M. Tannemaat M.R. Grand R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G69-G84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells at 70–80% confluence were suspended by treatment with trypsin, washed with PBS, and electroporated with 3 μg of pRC expression vectors, 1 μg of TOPFLASH or FOPFLASH reporter (kindly provided by Ken Kinzler, The Johns Hopkins University), 25 ng of pRL-CMV Renilla control reporter (Promega), and 31 μg of Bluescript II SK+ (Stratagene) as carrier. Media were changed at 24 h, and at 48 h the cells were harvested by trypsin treatment and washed once in PBS. Luciferase assays were carried out by using the dual luciferase assay kit. Luciferase activity was normalized to both total protein concentration and the transfection control Renilla luciferase levels. Cellular DNA content was quantified as described (32Lynch J. Keller M. Guo R. Yang D. Traber P.G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6395-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected by electroporation using a Pulse Controller II (Bio-Rad). Media were changed at 24 h, and at 48 h the cells were harvested and fixed in PBS, 70% EtOH at –20 °C. The following day the cells were washed and stained with propidium iodide. DNA content was quantified by flow cytometry, with gating on GFP+ cells.A human cyclin D1 promoter-luciferase reporter construct (D1pro-1749 (PvuII)) was provided by Dr. Anil Rustgi (University of Pennsylvania) (37Yan Y.X. Nakagawa H. Lee M.H. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33181-33190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cdx1 truncation constructs were synthesized by PCR using oligonucleotide primers to amplify Cdx1 truncations from a murine cDNA template as described (32Lynch J. Keller M. Guo R. Yang D. Traber P.G.

Suh E. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: G872-G880Google Scholar). The truncated cyclin D1 promoter (CD –960) and the CD –960 mutant promoter (TCF (0)–(4)) were both kindly provided by Osamu Tetsu and Frank McCormick, University of California, San Francisco (15Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3237) Google Scholar).Immunoblot, and Immunohistochemical and Immunoprecipitation Analyses—Several 100-mm plates of DLD1 cells were infected and cultured. At 48 h, they were suspended by trypsin treatment and washed twice in PBS, and then whole-cell protein extracts were prepared as described previously (32Lynch J. Keller M. Guo R. Yang D. Traber P.G.

Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared as described previously (39Rings E.H. Boudreau F. Taylor J.K. Moffett J. Suh E.R. Traber P.G. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 1437-1450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The antibodies for Cdx1 (CPSP) and Cdx2 (CNL) have been described previously (30Silberg D.G.

The β-catenin antibody was mouse monoclonal 610153 (Transduction Laboratories). For Western blot loading control, we used the actin:A-4700 (Sigma).For the β-catenin co-immunoprecipitation study, DLD1 cells were infected by adenovirus as before. At 48 h post-infection, cells were harvested and lysed in mammalian protein extract reagent (M-PER, Pierce). Immunoprecipitation was performed by using the anti-β-catenin antibody (sc-7199, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The precipitated products were analyzed by Western blotting by using an anti-TCF4 monoclonal antibody (sc-8631, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-β-catenin (sc-7963, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Immunofluorescence and Immunohistochemistry—DLD1 cells were transfected and cultured as described. At 48 h cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, stained for Cdx1 (using polyclonal CPSP) and β-catenin (mouse monoclonal antibody, Transduction Laboratories), and then followed by the secondary antibodies cy2-anti-mouse and cy3-anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The cells were examined by fluorescent microscopy, and images were obtained by using a Photometrix Coolsnap-CF Black and White CCD camera (Roeper Scientific) mounted on a Nikon E600 fluorescent microscope. Min mouse polyps were kindly provided by Greg Enders (University of Pennsylvania). Each sample was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and paraffin-embedded for immunohistochemical staining. Sections were immersed in 0.01 mol/liter citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and microwaved for 10–13 min. The slides were deparaffinized and then treated with 30% hydrogen peroxidase and avidin/biotin according to the protocol provided by Vector Laboratories. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C by using the following primary antibodies, Cdx1-CPSP (1:1000) and β-catenin (1:250, Transduction Laboratories). The slides were stained using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma), counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted using Permount (Fisher).Northern Blot and Ribonuclease Protection Analysis—Total RNA was isolated by using RNeasy (Qiagen) from several 100-mm plates of infected DLD1 cells. 20 mg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose and 6% formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and then probed as described previously (33Lynch J. Suh E.R. Silberg D.G. Rulyak S. Blanchard N. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4499-4506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Human c-Myc cDNA (kindly provided by Gary Wu, University of Pennsylvania), human cyclin D1 cDNA (provided by Anil Rustgi, University of Pennsylvania), and human 36B4 were random-primed and 32P-labeled and used separately as a probe for Northern blot analysis. To reprobe blots for each subsequent probe, the membrane was first stripped of the previous probe by washing in Blot Wash Buffer at 60 °C for 1 h. Blot was exposed to XAR film with an intensifying screen for 48 h to confirm stripping of the previous probe and then prehybridized and hybridized as before.Xenopus Wnt Reporter Assays—For the Xenopus Wnt reporter assays, 100 pg of LEF-fos plasmid (similar to TOPFLASH except that it contains seven TCF/LEF-binding sites upstream of a minimal promoter derived from the fos promoter (40Hsu S.C. Galceran J. Grosschedl R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4807-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and 25 pg of pRL-SV40 (a Renilla luciferase control for injection)) were injected into the animal pole of fertilized eggs with mRNA encoding Xenopus wnt-1 and/or mouse cdx2 (100 pg of each mRNA/embryo). Embryos were harvested at the early gastrula stage (2 × 10 embryos per sample), and luciferase assay were performed with a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega), as described previously (41Yang J. Tan C. Darken R.S. Wilson P.A. Klein P.S. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 5743-5752Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Results for each group were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. The mean from four independent experiments was plotted.RESULTSCdx1 Expression Reduces c-Myc and Cyclin D1 Gene Expression in Human Colon Cancer Cells—In a previous study we established that expression of Cdx1 in human colon cancer cells inhibited proliferation by reducing cyclin D1 mRNA and protein levels (32Lynch J. Keller M. Guo R. Yang D. Traber P.G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6395-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Initial transfection studies with a cyclin D1 promoter-reporter (–1749)-Luc found Cdx1 reduced promoter activity by 20–30%. This reduction was modest compared with the 60–75% reduction we typically observed in cyclin D1 mRNA and protein (Fig. 1A) (32Lynch J. Keller M. Guo R. Yang D. Traber P.G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6395-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As the protein and mRNA determinations were carried out with adenovirally mediated Cdx1 expression, it was possible the discrepancy was due to differences in techniques. We therefore generated stable D1(–1749)-Luc-transfected DLD1 cells to examine the promoter response to adeno-Cdx1 treatment. 80 individual clones were screened, and 8 were found to express luciferase activity. We tested seven clones for their response to adeno-Cdx1 treatment. We found adeno-Cdx1 reduced luciferase activity between 10 and 35% when compared with controls in five of the seven clones (Fig. 1B, clones 65, 41, 70, 26, and 37). One clone had an indeterminate response (clone 19), and luciferase levels were mildly induced in one clone (clone 9). In summary, Cdx1 expression reliably reduced cyclin D1 (–1749) promoter activity by an average of 20–30% in DLD1 cells.Cdx1 Expression in Colon Cancer Cells Inhibits β-Catenin/TCF Reporter Activity—We next began investigating known mechanisms regulating cyclin D1 gene expression in human colon cancer cells. In previous studies, we noted that c-Myc mRNA levels were reduced by Cdx1 expression (Fig. 1A) to 40% of adeno-Null-treated cells and only 20% of uninfected cells. A microarray analysis comparing adeno-Cdx1- and adeno-Null-treated DLD1 cells found Cdx1 reduced cyclin D1 and c-Myc as well as LEF1 mRNA levels (data not shown). All three were reduced 3–4-fold. We recognized all three genes as transcriptional targets of the Wnt/β-catenin/TCF signaling pathway (10Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl.

Substrates are short-lived, misfolded proteins, and most of them are targeted to degradation by covalent attachment of polyubiquitin chains. 26 S proteasomes are composed of proteolytically active complexes, known as 20 S core particles, and regulatory complexes, called 19 S cap complexes. The 19 S cap complex itself is composed of two subcomplexes, the base and lid complexes. The base complex consists of six AAA-ATPases, numbered from Rpt1 to Rpt6, and two high molecular mass non-ATPases, Rpn1 and Rpn2. Rpn10 connects the base and lid complexes, though it is not essential. The lid complex consists of eight Rpn subunits (1Hilt W. Wolf D.H. Proteasomes: the World of Regulatory Proteolysis. Eurekah.com/Landes Biosciences Publ. Co., Georgetown, TX2000Crossref Google Scholar). 20 S core particles are only able to degrade peptides and unfolded proteins. Proteolysis of ubiquitylated proteins is ATP-dependent and requires the association of 20 S core with 19 S cap complexes, which regulate substrate recognition and unfolding. Ubiquitin moieties of the substrate are recognized by at least two subunits, namely Rpt5 and Rpn10 (2Lam Y.A. Lawson T.G. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Pickart C.M.

The base ATPases possess chaperone functions, which promote substrate translocation into the catalytic chamber of the core particle (7Braun B.C. Glickman M. Kraft R. Dahlmann B. Kloetzel P.M. Finley D. Schmidt M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Apart from key roles of 19 S cap complexes in proteasomal proteolysis, base complexes were proposed to serve separate functions in transcription control (8Gonzalez F. Delahodde A. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of the 19 S cap complex, the functions of most of its subunits remain unknown. In yeasts 80% of 26 S proteasomes are localized inside the nucleus. Core and cap subunits are present in roughly equal stoichiometry with an abundance of 15,000-30,000 molecules/cell, which constitute ∼1% of the total protein (9Russell S.J. Steger K.A. Johnston S.A.

Immunoelectron microscopy in fission yeast revealed predominant proteasome decorations at the nucleoplasmic side of the NE 1The abbreviations used are: NE, nuclear envelope; DAPI, 4,6-dia-midino-2-phenylindole; HA, hemagglutinin epitope; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; NLS, nuclear localization signal; S, Streptactin epitope; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PBST, PBS containing 0.1% Tween; MPBST, dried milk in PBST; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; FOA, 5-fluororotic acid.

In our group, we addressed the question how proteasomes are targeted into the nucleus. The NE is gated by nuclear pores. Their dimensions could accommodate assembled 26 S proteasomes. Nevertheless, large cargo proteins do not passively diffuse through nuclear pores but use a signal-mediated transport system. They are carried from the cytoplasm into the nucleus by nuclear transport receptors, called karyopherins or importins. The heterodimer karyopherin αβ was the first described carrier and is referred to as the classic NLS receptor. The α subunit recognizes the cargo NLS, and the β subunit adapts the cargo complex to the nuclear pore and moves it into the nucleus. Classic NLS are characterized by short stretches of basic amino acid residues. The SV40 T antigen NLS was established as a monopartite NLS prototype, and the nucleoplasmin NLS as a bipartite NLS prototype. The basic amino acid residues of a bipartite NLS are spaced by 10-12 unconserved amino acid residues (11Fried H. Kutay U. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). With regard to nuclear import of proteasomes, we discovered that 20 S core particles are imported as inactive precursor complexes by karyopherin αβ (12Lehmann A. Janek K. Braun B. Kloetzel P.M. Enenkel C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Karyopherin αβ was confirmed to be associated with core subunits by proteomics organizations that systematically analyzed tandem-affinity-purified protein complexes of yeast (13Gavin A.C. Bosche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J. Rick J.M. Michon A.M. Cruciat C.M. Remor M. Hofert C. Schelder M. Brajenovic M. Ruffner H. Merino A. Klein K. Hudak M. Dickson D. Rudi T. Gnau V.

Nature. 2002; 415: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (4008) Google Scholar). In this work, we investigated nuclear import of 19 S cap complexes. We found that it depends on karyopherin αβ and that Rpn2 confers a crucial NLS for efficient nuclear targeting of base complexes under restrictive conditions. Yeast Strains, Media, and Plasmids—Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this work are listed in Table I. Standard methods and media were used for yeast growth and manipulation (14Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991Google Scholar). Rpn1 and Rpn11 were C-terminally tagged by GFPHA, CFPHA, or Protein A by homologous recombination of SacIXhoI-cut Rpn1 tag::HIS3::URA3 and Rpn11 tag::HIS3::URA3 into the chromosomal locus, respectively (15Enenkel C. Lehmann A. Kloetzel P.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6144-6154Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To use LEU2 as an auxotrophic marker in gene replacements, HIS3 and URA3 were excised from the original pBSHU construct as a XbaI-PstI fragment and replaced by the LEU2 gene.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainAltered proteinsGenotypeSourceWCGaMATa his3-11,15 leu2-3, 112 ura3 can GAL(19)PWn1CRpn1-CFPHAMATa his3-11,15 leu2-3, 112 ura3 RPN1-CFP(HA)2::LEU2This studyPWn1Cn49GRpn1-CFPHA NUP49-GFPMATa his3-11,15 leu2-3, 112 ura3 RPN1-CFP(HA)2::LEU2 (pSW636)This studyPWn1Cp5GRpn1-CFPHA PDR5*-GFPMATa his3-11,15 leu2-3, 112 ura3 RPN1-CFP(HA)2::LEU2 (pRE105)This studyPWn11CRpn11-CFPHAMATa his3-11,15 leu2-3, 112 ura3 RPN11-CFP (HA)2::LEU2This studyPWn11Cn49GRpn11-CFPHA NUP49-GFPMATa his3-11,15 leu2-3, 112 ura3 RPN11-CFP(HA)2::LEU2 (pSW636)This studyPWn11Cp5GRpn11-CFPHA PDR5*-GFPMATa his3-11, 15 leu2-3, 112 ura3 RPN11-CFP(HA)2::LEU2 (pRE105)This studyPWn11PRpn11-ProAMATa his3-11,15 leu2-3, 112 ura3 RPN 11-ProteinA::HIS3::URA3This studyPWn1PRpn1-ProAMATa his3-11,15 leu2-3, 112 ura3 RPN 1-ProteinA::HIS3::URA3This studysrp1-49srp1-49MATa ade2-1 trp1 63 his3-11,15 leu2-3, 112 ura3-1can1-100 Δsrp1::LEU2 (pNOY175)(28)PWn11G1-49srp1-49 Rpn11GFPMATa ade2-1 trp1 63 his3-11,15 leu2-3, 112 ura3-1can1-100 Δsrp1::LEU2 Rpn11-GFPHA::HIS3::URA3 (pNOY175)This studySRP1SRP1MATa ade2-1 trp1-1 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 ura3-1, can1-100 Δsrp1::LEU2 (pNOY137, pRS316)(28)PWn11GSRPSRP1 Rpn11GFPHAThis studyPWn1G1-49srp1-49 Rpn1 GFPMATa ade2-1 trp1 63 his3-11,15 leu2-3, 112 ura3-1can1-100 Δsrp1::LEU2 Rpn1-GFPHA::HIS3::URA3 (pNOY175)This studyPWn1GSRPSRP1 Rpn1GFPHAThis studyPWGpYESGFPSMATa his3-11,15 leu2-3, 112 ura3 (pG)This studyPWNLSGpYES SV40NLSMATa his3-11,15 leu2-3, 112 ura3 (pNLSG)This studyPWmNLSGpYES mSV40NLSMATa his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 ura3 (pmNLSG)This studyPWRpt1NLSGpYES Rpt1NLSMATa his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 ura3 (pRpt1NLSG)This studyPWRpt2NLSGpYES Rpt2NLSMATa his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 ura3 (pRpt2NLSG)This studyPWRpn2NLSGpYES Rpn2NLSMATa his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 ura3 (pRpn2NLSG)This studyCEY1bSrp1-ProAMATa his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 ura3 Δsrp1::URA3 pRS315SRP1-ProA(20)PWt2HRpt2-HAMata his3-Δ200 lys2-801 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 ura3-52 Δrpt2::TRP1 (pRpt2H)This studyPWt2GRpt2-GFPHAMata his3-Δ200 lys2-801 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 ura3-52 Δrpt2::TRP1 (pRpt2G)This studyPWΔNt2HΔNLS-rpt2-HAMata his3-Δ200 lys2-801 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 ura3-52 Δrpt2::TRP1 (pΔNRpt2G)This studyPWΔNt2GΔNLS-rpt2-GFPHAMata his3-Δ200 lys2-801 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 ura3-52 Δrpt2::TRP1 (pΔNRpt2G)This studyPWn2HRpn2-HAMATa his3-11, 15 leu2-3, 112 ura3 RPN2-(HA)2::HIS3::URA3This studyPWΔCn2HΔNLS-rpn2-HAMATa his3-11,15 leu2-3, 112 ura3 RPN2-ΔC-(HA)2::HIS3::URA3This studyPWn2Hβ5HRpn2-HA Pre2-HAMATa his3-11, 15 leu2-3, 112 ura3 RPN2-(HA)2::HIS3::URA3 PRE2-(HA)2::LEU2This studyPWΔCn2Hβ5HΔNLS-rpn2-HA Pre2-HAMATa his3-11, 15 leu2-3, 112 ura3 RPN2-ΔC-(HA)2::HIS3::URA3 PRE2(HA)2::LEU2This studyPWn11HTPRpn11-HA-TEV-ProAMATa his3-11, 15 leu2-3, 112 ura3 RPN 11-HA-TEV-ProteinA::HIS3::URA3This studyPWn2Hn11PRpn2-HA Rpn11-ProAMATa his3-11, 15 leu2-3, 112 ura3 RPN2-(HA)2::HIS3::URA3 RPN11-ProteinA::LEU2This studyPWΔCn2Hn11PΔNLS-rpn2-HA Rpn11-ProAMATa his3-11,15 leu2-3, 112 ura3 RPN2-ΔC-(HA)2::HIS3::URA3 RPN11-ProteinA::LEU2This studyPWt2Hn11HTPRpt2-HA Rpn11-HA-TEV-ProAMata his3-Δ200 lys2-801 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 ura3-52 Δrpt2::TRP1 RPN11-HA-TEV-ProteinA::HIS3::URA3 (pRpt2H)This studyPWΔNt2Hn11HTPΔNLS-rpt2HA Rpn11-HA-TEV-ProAMata his3-Δ200 lys2-801 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-52 Δrpt2::TRP1 RPN11-HA-TEV-ProteinA::HIS3::URA3 (pΔNRpt2H)This study Open table in a new tab PWt2Hn11HTP (HA-TEV-ProA-tagged Rpn11) was created by insertion of a NdeI-XbaI fragment encoding the TEV cleavage site followed by a ZZ domain from pEZZ18 (Amersham Biosciences, pZZ-HIS5) within PWn11P. Endogenous Rpn2 was replaced by the HA-tagged version by homologous recombination techniques using SacI-PvuII-cut Rpn2-HA2:: HIS3::URA3. Between the last amino acid of Rpn2 and the HA tag a spacer of 15 amino acids (AGSRANSSTLAAVTS) has been inserted. The C-terminal deletion of 161 amino acids of Rpn2 in PWΔCn2H has been created by using the same integration cassette as for Rpn2 HA. Immunoblot analysis of PWΔCn2H lysates revealed HA-tagged ΔNLSrpn2 with the predicted molecular mass (88 kDa). However, base complexes purified from PWΔCn2Hn11P contained ΔNLSrpn2HA and a degradation product ΔNLSrpn2 of ∼78 kDa. PWt2H, PWt2G, PWΔNt2H, and PWΔNt2G are derived from strain DY62 (16Rubin D.M. Glickman M.H. Larsen C.N. Dhruvakumar S. Finley D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4909-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), in which Dp42 was replaced by pRpt2H-16 generating the appropriate shuffle strain PWt2H16. pRpt2H-16 is a pRS316 (URA3, CEN)-based vector containing a 1.8-kb XhoI-BamHI fragment that includes the RPT2 coding sequence plus 482 bp of the promoter region. LEU2-marked CEN plasmids, carrying wild type or truncated versions of Rpt2, were introduced into PWt2H16. Upon FOA reversion, strains were obtained with only the LEU2-marked plasmid (Table II) covering the chromosomal RPT2 deletion. pRpt2H is pRS315 (CEN, LEU2) containing the 1.8-kb XhoI-BamHI RPT2 fragment and a 75-bp BamHIXbaI double HA fragment. Into the unique BamHI site of pRpt2H a fragment encoding GFP without a stop codon was inserted resulting in pRpt2G. pΔNRpt2H and pΔNRpt2G were derived from pRpt2H and pRpt2G, respectively. The RPT2 promoter region from -482 bp to the start codon was PCR-amplified as an XhoI-SacI fragment, the coding region from base pair 129 to the last codon as an SacI-XbaI fragment. Both fragments were ligated into pRS315 obtaining plasmids encoding HA- or GFPHA-tagged Δ1-43 rpt2.Table IIPlasmids used in this studyPlasmidCharacteristicsSourcepSW636ARS-CEN, LEU2, GFP-NUP49 (pRS315)(21)pRE105ARS-CEN, LEU2, PDR5*-GFP(22)PNOY175(28)pNOY137(28)pRS315SRP1ProAARS-CEN, LEU2, SRP1-ProA (pRS315)(20)pG2μ URA3, GAL:GFP-S (pYES)This studypNLSG2μ URA3, GAL:SV40NLS-GFP-S(pYES)This studypmNLSG2μ URA3, GAL:mutSV40NLS-GFP-S (pYES)This studypRpt1NLSG2μ URA3, GAL:Rpt1NLS-GFP-S (pYES)This studypRpt2NLSG2μ URA3, GAL:Rpt2NLS-GFP-S (pYES)This studypRpn2NLSG2μ URA3, GAL:Rpn2NLS-GFP-S (pYES)This studypRpt2H-16ARS-CEN, URA3, Rpt2 (pRS316)This studypRpt2HARS-CEN, LEU2, Rpt2-HA (pRS315)This studypRpt2GARS-CEN, LEU2, Rpt2-GFPHA (pRS315)This studypΔNRpt2HARS-CEN, LEU2, ΔN-Rpt2-HA (pRS315)This studypΔNRpt2GARS-CEN, LEU2, ΔN-Rpt2-GFPHA (pRS315)This study Open table in a new tab NLS-like sequences were fused to GFPS reporter protein using HindIII-KpnI-cut pYES-GFPS.

Localization Studies—For in vivo localization studies cells were grown to mid-log phase in synthetic complete medium, transferred to slides, and immediately examined with a Leica DMR microscope (15Enenkel C. Lehmann A. Kloetzel P.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6144-6154Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Filters for fluorescein isothiocyanate/GFP (495-nm excitation and 525-nm emission) or CFP (436-nm excitation and 480-emission) were used (17Damelin M. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 133-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Photographs were taken with a Hamamatsu C5985-10 charge-coupled device camera using the MetaVue Software (Visitron Systems, Puchheim, Germany). Settings were identical for all images in a given experiment. Quantification of Rpn1-GFP and Rpn11-GFP in srp1-49 and SRP1 cells was done with the MetaVue system by selecting a fixed square of approximately the size of one-fifth of a yeast nucleus in the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm, respectively, and calculating the average pixel intensity per area. A minimum of 20 values from different images was averaged. The ratio of average pixel intensity was obtained for each strain by dividing the cytoplasmic intensity by the nucleoplasmic intensity. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on formaldehyde-fixed cells (15Enenkel C. Lehmann A. Kloetzel P.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6144-6154Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Labeling with mAb12CA5 (1:500 dilution; Roche Applied Science) and mAb414 (1:500 dilution; BabCO) was visualized by Cy3-labeled donkey-anti-mouse IgG (1:100 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) using the Cy3 filter. DAPI-stained nuclei were visualized by using the UV filter. Protein Biochemistry—Yeast cells were grown to mid log phase in YPD medium (yeast extract 1%, peptone 2%, dextrose 2%) and disintegrated by French press in the appropriate buffer. For a 10-40% glycerol gradient, ultracentrifugation buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.75, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml DNase I-EP, EDTA free Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) was used. 2 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2 were added as indicated. Peptide hydrolysis activity was assayed by using benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Glu-β-naphthylamide (Bachem) (15Enenkel C. Lehmann A. Kloetzel P.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6144-6154Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis using polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (polyvinylidene fluoride, Immobilon, Millipore). Ubiquitin was identified by anti-ubiquitin Z0458 antibodies (DAKO), HA by mAb HA.11 (BabCO), proteasomal subunits by polyclonal antibodies raised against Cim3/Rpt6 (18Ghislain M. Udvardy A. Mann C. Nature. 1993; 366: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), Pre2/β5 (19Heinemeyer W. Fischer M. Krimmer T. Stachon U. Wolf D.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16499-16502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Affinity Purifications—Standard IgG Sepharose affinity chromatography was performed using buffer PB (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml DNase I-EP) Cells were grown to mid log phase in 1 liter of YPD medium at 28 °C and disintegrated by passing them trough a French pressure cell. After removal of cell debris (14,000 × g, 20 min), the cell extracts were passed twice over a 1/25 lysate volume of IgG-Sepharose beads (Amersham Bioscience) at room temperature. The resin was washed with 50 bed volumes of buffer PB, and bound proteins were eluted with 0.5 m HOAc/NH4OAc (pH 3.4). Sequential IgG-Sepharose affinity chromatography from PWn11HTP lysates was performed following the standard protocol but in the presence of 2 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2. Proteins were eluted with 4 ml of buffer B (without ATP and MgCl2), 20 S proteasomes were eluted with 4 ml of buffer B containing 300 mm NaCl, and 19 S base complex was eluted with 4 ml of buffer B containing 600 mm NaCl. NLS-GFP-Strep-tagged constructs were affinity-purified over Strep-Tactin matrices followed by elution with 5 mm desthiobiotin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Institut für Bioanalytik GmbH, Göttingen, Germany). To eliminate biotinylated proteins from the extract prior to binding to the matrix, it was precleared for 30 min at 4 °C by adding 40 μg of avidin (Sigma) per ml of lysate. Far Western Analysis—NLS-containing proteins were identified by far Western analysis using Protein A-tagged karyopherin α (Srp1) as the binding partner. French press lysates (20 mg/ml protein) of strain CEY1b (20Enenkel C. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16499-16502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) were prepared in buffer PB with EDTA-free Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and refolded in renaturation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 100 mm KOAc, 5 mm MgOAc, 0.3% Tween, 0.5% bovine serum albumin) overnight at 4 °C. After blocking for 30 min in 5% dried milk in PBST (MPBST), the filter was incubated in 10 ml of MPBST containing a 1:5 dilution of CEY1b lysate to detect NLS-GFPS proteins and a 1:1 dilution of CEY1b lysate to detect 19 S subcomplexes. As a control, filters were incubated in 10 ml of MPBST containing 10 μg of Protein A. Incubation for 4 h at 4 °C was followed by washing with PBST. The blot was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled rabbit IgG in MPBST for 1 h at 4 °C and processed for enhanced chemiluminescence detection. After ECL detection the blot was stained with Amido Black. In this work, we set out to investigate the nuclear import of base and lid complexes of proteasome regulatory particles. To study in vivo localizations of both subcomplexes, each complex was functionally tagged with fluorescent proteins. Rpn1 and Rpn11 were chosen as reporter subunits of the base and lid complexes, respectively. By exploiting homologous recombination techniques (12Lehmann A. Janek K. Braun B. Kloetzel P.M. Enenkel C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) yeast strains were created in which endogenous Rpn1 and Rpn11 were chromosomally replaced by GFPHA- and CFPHA-tagged variants. To compare the localization of the proteasomal base and lid subunits with the localization of proteins marking the ER/NE network, nucleoporin Nup49 and the ER-resident proteasomal substrate Pdr5* were co-expressed as GFP-labeled proteins (21Bucci M. Wente S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1185-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 22Plemper R.K. Egner R. Kuchler K. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32848-32856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The cyan fluorescence of both proteasomal subunits was predominantly detected in the nucleus and specifically merged with the green fluorescence of Nup49 and Pdr5* at the NE (Fig. 1A) consistent with previous reports on the localization of Mts4 and Pad1, the fission yeast homologues of budding yeast Rpn1 and Rpn11 (10Wilkinson C.R. Wallace M. Morphew M. Perry P. Allshire R. Javerzat J.P. McIntosh J.R. Gordon C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6465-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To prove the functionality of the tagged versions of Rpn1 and Rpn11, glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation was performed. The tagged versions of Rpn1 and Rpn11 were detected in fast migrating fractions comprising proteasomes (not shown). Hence, the tagged versions of Rpn1 and Rpn11 were incorporated into their proteasomal subcomplexes. Furthermore, cells were created in which either Rpn1 or Rpn11 were functionally tagged with Protein A, allowing the affinity purification of proteasomal subcomplexes. Lysates of these cells were prepared and applied to standard IgG-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Tightly bound proteins were released from the affinity resin by low pH and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. All proteins were 19 S subunits as identified by fingerprint mass spectroscopy (23Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rpn11-ProA and Rpn1-ProA appeared to be stoichiometrically associated with base and lid subunits (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). Endogenous Rpn1 and Rpn11 were not present in the complexes confirming that they were replaced by the Protein A-tagged versions, respectively. Based on these findings we concluded that our tagged versions of Rpn1 and Rpn11 are functional, thus suited to report on the in vivo localization of base and lid complexes. To get insight into the import pathway of these complexes, GFPHA-labeled Rpn1 and Rpn11 were expressed in a set of nuclear import mutants. Significant delocalization of both reporter proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm was observed in mutants affecting the classic NLS-dependent import pathway, especially in the temperature-sensitive srp1-49 mutant. At restrictive temperatures, GFPHA-labeled Rpn1 and Rpn11 obviously accumulated inside the cytoplasm of the srp1-49 mutant compared with isogenic wild type cells (Fig. 2A). By using the MetaVue system we measured the pixel intensities within the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of srp1-49 and wild type cells expressing GFPHA-labeled Rpn1 and Rpn11, respectively. The ratio of cytoplasmic to nuclear fluorescence intensity was calculated. At restrictive temperature, the ratio doubled in the srp1-49 mutant, whereas it did not change in wild type (Fig. 2B). One possibility to explain this phenomenon is that the srp1-49 mutation affects nuclear import of base and lid complexes. To ascertain that increased cytoplasmic fluorescence derived from base and lid complexes but not from non-incorporated subunits, lysates from srp1-49 and wild type cells expressing GFPHA-labeled Rpn1 and Rpn11 were fractionated by glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation (Fig. 2C, only shown for Rpn11-GFPHA). All gradient fractions were probed for Rpn11-GFPHA, the base ATPase Rpt6, and the core subunit β5. Rpn11 co-migrated with Rpt6 in fast sedimenting fractions showing that all fusion proteins were incorporated into their proteasomal subcomplexes of srp1-49 as well as of wild type cells (Fig. 2C; panels labeled with Rpn11-GFPHA and Rpt6). Therefore, it is unlikely that single lid and base subunits accumulated inside the cytoplasm of srp1-49. Proteolytically active proteasomes peaked in fraction numbers 12-15 as shown by the presence of matured β5 (Fig. 2C, panels labeled with pro-β5 and m-β5). Compared with wild type, Rpn11-GFPHA and Rpt6 were slightly shifted to slower sedimenting fractions suggesting that lid and base subcomplexes accumulate in the srp1-49 mutant (Fig. 2C; base and lid subunits starting at fraction 8 in srp1-49 and at fraction 10 in wild type). To verify this assumption, we determined in which glycerol gradient fractions 19 S regulatory complexes and their subcomplexes migrated. 19 S regulatory complexes were isolated by sequential affinity purification using a modified protocol of Saeki and coworkers (24Saeki Y. Toh-e A. Yokosawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and subjected to ultracentrifugation. All fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Whole 19 S regulatory complexes were mainly detected in fractions 10-15 (Fig. S1), whereas 19 S subcomplexes migrated in fractions 8-11 as will be shown below (see Fig. 4D).Fig. 4Characterization of mutants expressing ΔNLS rpt2HA and ΔNLS rpn2HA.A, logarithmically grown wild type and NLS deletion strains were diluted to 1 × 107 cells/ml. 4 μl of 10-fold serial dilutions were spotted onto YPD plates to test temperature-sensitive growth and onto minimal media plates supplemented with either 0.6 μg/ml canavanine or 20 mg/ml arginine to test canavanine-sensitive growth. Minimal plates were incubated at 28 °C, and YPD plates were incubated at indicated temperatures for 3 days. B, ΔNLSrpn2HA mutants accumulate polyubiquitylated proteins. Logarithmically grown cells expressing either ΔNLSrpn2HA (lane 1) or Rpn2HA (lane 2) were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Extracts from cell equivalents were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-ubiquitin, HA, Rpt6, and β5 antibodies. C, ΔNLSrpn2HA is incorporated into the proteasome. Exponentially grown cells either expressing ΔNLSrpn2HA and Rpn2HA instead of the endogenous proteins were shifted for 1 h to 37 °C (strains PWn2Hβ5H and PWΔCn2Hβ5H). Extracts were prepared in the presence of 150 mm salt and subjected to 10-40% glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation. Fractions were collected from the top to bottom of the gradient and assayed for peptide cleavage activity using the substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Glu-β-naphthylamide in the absence and presence of ATP. The specific activity is referred to as the maximum value (upper diagram). Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against HA epitopes and Rpt6 (lower panels). D, ΔNLSrpt2HA is tightly associated with the base complex, whereas Δrpn2HA is loosely associated with the base complex. Base complexes from ΔNLSrpt2HA, ΔNLSrpn2HA, and their wild types were isolated by affinity chromatography as follows: Protein A-tagged Rpn11 was chromosomally introduced into cells expressing ΔNLSrpt2HA, ΔNLSrpn2HA, Rpt2HA, and Rpn2HA, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2004840350,"We recently reported a new metabolic competency for Escherichia coli, the ability to degrade and utilize fatty acids of various chain lengths as sole carbon and energy sources (Campbell, J. W., Morgan-Kiss, R. M., and Cronan J. E. (2003) Mol. Microbiol. 47, 793–805). This β-oxidation pathway is distinct from the previously described aerobic fatty acid degradation pathway and requires enzymes encoded by two operons, yfcYX and ydiQRSTD. The yfcYX operon (renamed fadIJ) encodes enzymes required for hydration, oxidation, and thiolytic cleavage of the acyl chain. The ydiQRSTD operon encodes a putative acyl-CoA synthetase, ydiD (renamed fadK), as well as putative electron transport chain components. We report that FadK is as an acyl-CoA synthetase that has a preference for short chain length fatty acid substrates (<10 C atoms). The enzymatic mechanism of FadK is similar to other acyl-CoA synthetases in that it forms an acyl-AMP intermediate prior to the formation of the final acyl-CoA product. Expression of FadK is repressed during aerobic growth and is maximally expressed under anaerobic conditions in the presence of the terminal electron acceptor, fumarate. We recently reported a new metabolic competency for Escherichia coli, the ability to degrade and utilize fatty acids of various chain lengths as sole carbon and energy sources (Campbell, J.

Expression of FadK is repressed during aerobic growth and is maximally expressed under anaerobic conditions in the presence of the terminal electron acceptor, fumarate. Acyl-CoA synthetases (more properly called fatty acid:CoA ligases or acyl-CoA ligases) perform key roles in metabolic and regulatory processes by activating free fatty acids to their CoA thioesters. The enzymatic mechanism is a two-step reaction that proceeds via the intermediate formation of an acyl-adenylate (acyl-AMP) intermediate: step 1, fatty acid + ATP → fatty acyl-AMP + PPi and step 2, fatty acyl-AMP + CoA → fatty acyl-CoA + AMP. Acyl-CoAs serve as important intermediates in diverse metabolic functions, such as fatty acid transport, β-oxidative degradation of fatty acids, and phospholipid biosynthesis, as well as enzyme activation, cell signaling, and transcriptional regulation (1Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Consistent with the diverse roles of acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSs) 1The abbreviations used are: ACS, acyl-CoA synthetase; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; fad, fatty acid degradation; FACS, fatty acid CoA-ligase; RB, rich broth; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-ethanesulfonic acid. in cell metabolism, many eukaryotic organisms encode several different ACSs that specifically activate short (C6–C8), medium (C10–C12), long (C14–C20), or very long (>C22) chain length fatty acids (1Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 2Fujino T. Man-Jong K. Minekura H. Suzuki H. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Moreover, some organisms possess multiple enzymes for each set of acyl chain lengths. In contrast, only a single ACS called FadD has been reported in Escherichia coli, although, multiple ACS isoforms of varying molecular masses recently shown to be artifacts of proteolysis (3Yoo J.H. Cheng O.H. Gerber G.E. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 699-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) had been reported (4Kameda K. Imai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 832: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 5Samuel D. Estroumza J. Ailhaud G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 12: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). E. coli FadD has been purified to homogeneity (6Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Metzger A.K. Heimert T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25513-25520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kameda K. Nunn W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5702-5707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has a broad substrate specificity for fatty acids of medium and long chain lengths. Activation of long chain fatty acids to their acyl-CoA thioesters is required not only for aerobic degradation of the acids, but also for induction of the fad (fatty acid degradation) genes that catalyze the degradation process. In the absence of long chain acyl-CoAs, the FadR regulatory protein binds to its operator sequences, where it functions as a repressor of transcription of the fad genes (and as a transcriptional activator of the fabA and fabB fatty acid biosynthetic genes) (8Campbell J.W. Morgan-Kiss R.M. Cronan Jr., E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 9Henry M.F. Cronan Jr., J.E.

However, in the presence of long chain acyl-CoAs, FadR is released from the fad operators and transcription of these genes is induced. Acyl-CoAs of 10 or fewer acyl carbon atoms cannot release FadR from the operator sites and thus the aerobic degradative pathway is not induced and the acids cannot be utilized for growth. However, when FadR is inactivated by mutation these strains can utilize medium chain length fatty acids as the sole carbon source (8Campbell J.W. Morgan-Kiss R.M. Cronan Jr., E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 9Henry M.F. Cronan Jr., J.E.

ACSs belong to a larger family of AMP-forming enzymes, which include firefly luciferase, acetyl-CoA synthetases, and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (11Babbitt P.C. Kenyon G.L. Martin B.M. Charest H. Slyvestre M. Scholten J.D. Chang K.H. Liang P.H. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5594-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 12Chang K.H. Xiang H. Dunaway-Mariano D.

Biol. 1999; 3: 598-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), all of which form an acyl-adenylate intermediates in their reaction cycles. The sequences of members of this family share 20 to 40% homology, and possess a number of conserved motifs (11Babbitt P.C. Kenyon G.L. Martin B.M. Charest H. Slyvestre M. Scholten J.D. Chang K.H. Liang P.H. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5594-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). ACSs contain an additional motif, the fatty acid CoA-ligase (FACS) signature (15Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 454-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 16Weimar J.D. DiRusso C.C. Delio R. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29369-29376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Two putative AMP binding motifs (AMP1 and AMP2) as well as the FACS motif have been assigned to FadD (15Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 454-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 16Weimar J.D. DiRusso C.C. Delio R. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29369-29376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). All of these cofactor binding motifs are found in a 43-kDa C-terminal cleavage product that results from OmpT-catalyzed proteolysis consistent with retention of enzymatic activity by this fragment (3Yoo J.H. Cheng O.H. Gerber G.E. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 699-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that that E. coli can utilize fatty acids as sole carbon sources during growth under anaerobic conditions provided that an electron acceptor is present in the medium (8Campbell J.W. Morgan-Kiss R.M. Cronan Jr., E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This anaerobic β-oxidation pathway is distinct from the previously studied aerobic pathway in a number of properties. These are: (i) mutational studies demonstrated that several of the fad enzymes (FadD, FadBA, and FadE) required for the aerobic pathway are not required for anaerobic growth on fatty acids, (ii) the anaerobic fatty acid oxidation pathway is not under the control of FadR, the major regulator of the aerobic fad regulon, and (iii) fatty acids of different chain lengths are utilized by the two pathways (8Campbell J.W. Morgan-Kiss R.M. Cronan Jr., E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We identified two gene clusters encoding putative homologues of several fad enzymes, yfcYX and ydiQRSTD. The yfcYX operon encodes putative homologues for fadBA, and was renamed fadIJ (8Campbell J.W. Morgan-Kiss R.M. Cronan Jr., E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The ydiQRSTD operon contains several open reading frames encoding proteins that could also play a role in anaerobic β-oxidation. Proceeding upstream from ydiD, the genes encode a putative ferrodoxin (YdiT), a flavoprotein (YdiS) that could accept electrons and use these to reduce a quinone, and two proteins (YdiR and YdiQ) that seem likely to form a heterodimeric electron transport flavoprotein complex that might transfer electrons to YdiS. There is also a putative acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, ydiO, located immediately upstream of the ydiP gene (a possible AraC-like regulator of the ydiQRSTD operon). The proteins encoded by the ydiQRST genes have high sequence homologies to those encoded by the fixABCX operon of anaerobic carnitine metabolism (17Buchet A. Eichler K. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2599-2608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and may function as the electron transport chain linking the β-oxidation of fatty acids with the respiratory chain. The last gene of this putative operon is ydiD, which we renamed fadK and argued was likely to encode an ACS (8Campbell J.W. Morgan-Kiss R.M. Cronan Jr., E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This argument was based on the fact that FadK can be aligned with the FadD over its entire length (albeit with many gaps) and contains plausible AMP and FACS motifs. Furthermore, the double fadD fadK mutant failed to grow on fatty acids under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions (8Campbell J.W. Morgan-Kiss R.M. Cronan Jr., E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), although fadD mutants grew on fatty acids under anaerobic conditions. These results indicated that FadK could functionally replace FadD under anaerobic conditions. However, fadD mutants are unable to grow on long chain fatty acids aerobically (8Campbell J.W. Morgan-Kiss R.M. Cronan Jr., E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 18Overath P. Pauli G. Schairer H.U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 19Fulda M. Heinz E. Wolter F.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and thus the failure of FadK to replace FadD under aerobic conditions was attributed to insufficient expression of FadK or to impairment of enzyme function. We report that FadK is indeed an ACS that is primarily active on short chain fatty acids. FadK is not expressed under aerobic growth conditions. The enzyme is expressed under anaerobic conditions, but the level of expression depends on the terminal electron acceptor available. Materials—Labeled fatty acids were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Acyl-CoA standards, fatty acids, antibiotics, and most other chemicals were purchased from Sigma (Sigma). Octanoyl-AMP and oleoyl-AMP standards were synthesized according to Reed et al. (20Reed L.J. Leach F.R. Koike M. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 232: 123-142Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and Borgstrom (21Borgstrom B. Acta Chem. Scand. 1958; 12: 1533-1534Crossref Google Scholar), respectively. Timentin was from GlaxoSmithKline. The EnzChek® Pyrophosphate assay kit was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Growth Conditions and Media—Rich broth (RB) contained (g/liter) tryptone, 10; NaCl, 5; and yeast extract, 1. RB/MOPS medium was supplemented with 0.1 m sodium MOPS (pH 7.8). 2× YT medium contained (g/liter), tryptone, 16; NaCl, 5; and yeast extract, 10. Minimal medium was M9 medium (22Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) supplemented with 1 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.01% casamino acids (Difco), and 0.5 mg/ml thiamine (23Sawers G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1285-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For aerobic growth glucose and glycerol were used at concentrations of 0.4 and 0.2%, respectively. These concentrations were double when growth was anaerobic. Fatty acids were neutralized with KOH and solubilized with Tergitol Nonidet P-40 and were used at final concentrations of 1 g/liter (w/v) in aerobic or 2 g/liter in anaerobic cultures. Anaerobic cultures were supplemented with either 25 mm NaNO3 or 40 mm sodium fumarate. Growth in a strictly anaerobic environment was performed in a Coy anaerobic chamber containing an atmosphere of 5% H2, 75% N2, and 20% CO2 as previously described (8Campbell J.W. Morgan-Kiss R.M. Cronan Jr., E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Solid media contained 1.5% (w/v) Bactoagar (Difco, Milwaukee, WI). Construction of Plasmids and Bacterial Strains—All bacterial strains were derivatives of E. coli K12 (Table I). Strains RMK73 and RMK76 were constructed from strain MC1061 (24Wertman K.F. Wyman A.R. Botstein D. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 49: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) by the λ Red-mediated recombination method of Datsenko and Wanner (25Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11299) Google Scholar) using helper plasmid pKD46. The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene from plasmid pKD3 and the kanamycin resistance gene from pKD4 were amplified via PCR using primers pKD-fadK-L plus pKD-fadK-R or pKD-fadD-L plus pKD-fadD-R (Table II). The resulting PCR products were then used to replace the entire coding sequence of fadK or fadD with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or kanamycin resistance genes. Several antibiotic-resistant transformants were verified by colony PCR using primers fadK-C1 plus fadK-C2 or fadD-C1 plus fadD-C2 (Table II) for strains RMK73 or RMK76, respectively. The antibiotic resistance cassettes were removed using the FLP recombinase encoded on the temperature-sensitive helper plasmid, pCP20 (26Cherepanov P.P. Wackernagel W. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). Strain RMK92 was produced by P1 transduction of the fadD::kan phenotype from RMK89 into strain BL21DE3/pLysS. The fadD mutation was verified by the inability of strain RMK92 to grow on oleate as a sole carbon source. Transduction with phage P1vir and other basic genetic techniques were carried out as described previously (8Campbell J.W. Morgan-Kiss R.M. Cronan Jr., E.J. Mol.

The resultant 1.6-kb PCR products were purified via Qiagen spin columns and cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The inserts of the resultant plasmids were sequenced to verify the fidelity of the cloned PCR products. Two of the sequenced plasmids were digested with NdeI and BamHI (sites within the primers) and ligated to pET16b cut with the same enzymes to give in-frame fusions of the sequence encoding the His6 tag of pET16b with the 5′ end of fadK or fadD in plasmids pRK34 and pRK41, respectively (Table I). Tagging of the Chromosomal fadD and fadK Genes—To facilitate monitoring of the protein expression levels of FadD and FadK during growth, the chromosomal genes were directly tagged with a sequence encoding a C-terminal hexameric histidine tag based on the Datsenko and Wanner method (25Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11299) Google Scholar) for constructing gene deletions. A linear PCR product was synthesized from the CAT gene of pKD3 using modified primers. The upstream primer contained a sequence encoding six histidine codons followed by a stop codon. This sequence was flanked by 40 to 45 bp of homology to the 3′ end of either fadD or fadK (with the natural stop codon removed) as well as homology to the P1 region of the pKD3 plasmid (25Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11299) Google Scholar). The downstream primer was designed to contain 40 to 45 bp of homology to the region about 50 bases downstream of the 3′ end of the gene plus the P2 region of the pKD3 plasmid (25Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11299) Google Scholar). The primer set FadK-HIS-L plus FadK-HIS-R was used to construct the fadK-his6 fusion, and primer set FadD-HIS-L plus FadD-HIS-R was used to construct the fadD-his6 fusion (Table II). Correct insertion of the hexameric histidine tag was verified by PCR, sequencing (data not shown), and Western blot analyses (see below). Expression and Purification of His6-FadD and His6-FadK—Strain RMK92/pLysS was transformed with plasmids pRK34 or pRK41 encoding either His6-FadD or His6-FadK, respectively. Cultures (50–250 ml) were grown in LB broth supplemented with 12 μg/ml Timentin at 30 °C until an optical density of about 1 was reached and then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2.5 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended (4-fold concentration) in ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and centrifuged for 5 min at 4,000 × g. The pellets were stored at –80 °C until further use. All further purification steps were performed at 5 °C. For purification of the His-tagged enzymes, frozen pellets were thawed on ice for 15 min prior to the addition of 5–10 ml of buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl) containing 10 mm imidazole and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysozyme (1 mg/ml) was added and after 1 h of incubation on ice the cells were disrupted via sonication (three 20-s pulses). The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min and 1–3 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) was added to the resultant supernatant. The slurry was rotated slowly at 5 °C for 90 min and the resin was loaded into a 5-ml column and washed with 5 volumes of Buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole. The His6-tagged protein was eluted by 1 ml of buffer B (50 mm sodium TES, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl) and 250 mm imidazole. The elution was repeated 2 or 3 times. The purity of the samples was monitored via SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar). To remove trace amounts of contaminating phosphate, the purified enzyme preparations were dialyzed in a Pierce Slide-A-Lyzer cassette (Pierce) against two changes of buffer B for 12 h at 5 °C. Following dialysis, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol were added prior to storage at –80 °C. Coupled Spectrophotometric Assay for Acyl-CoA Synthetase Activity—Acyl-CoA synthetase activity was assayed by monitoring the inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) produced in the first half-reaction (28Upson R.H. Haugland R.P. Malekzadeh M.N. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 243: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Pyrophosphate production was assayed as phosphate using a commercial spectrophotometric assay (EnzChek® Pyrophosphate Assay Kit, Molecular Probes) in the presence of pyrophosphatase. The assay was very sensitive to the presence of contaminating inorganic phosphate; therefore, to remove contaminant Pi all enzyme preparations were dialyzed in Buffer B (see above) prior to use, and the presence of exogenous Pi was assayed in all enzyme preparations as well as all other reaction components by performing the assay in the absence of pyrophosphatase. The standard 1-ml ACS reaction contained: 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm ATP, 0.4 mm CoA, 1 mm fatty acid, 0.2 mm 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside, 1 unit of purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and 0.1 unit of pyrophosphatase. Because the unreacted 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside substrate contributed to a significant background absorbance (A360 > 0.3), the spectrophotometer was calibrated in the presence of a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl and 0.2 mm 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside prior to assay measurements. For continuous assays, reactions were incubated for 10 min at room temperature prior to enzyme addition to allow for traces of contaminating Pi to be consumed. For end point assays, the reaction was started by the addition of variable amounts of enzyme, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The change in absorbance at 360 nm was measured on a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer (Beckman-Coulter). In all experiments, the amount of PPi produced during the reaction was determined by subtracting the background absorbance in a control reaction containing buffer B in place of the enzyme preparation. Radioactive Assay for Acyl-CoA Synthetase Activity—The radioactive assay used to measure the formation of 14C-fatty acyl-CoAs from 14C-fatty acids was based on the assay of Kameda and Nunn (7Kameda K. Nunn W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5702-5707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated a standard 200-μl reaction mixture (29Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11328-11333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contained 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 μm ATP, 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm CoA, 10 μm fatty acid, and enzyme (2–5 and 0.2–5 μg for FadK and FadD, respectively). The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 15 min and then spun at top speed of a microcentrifuge for 1 min. For HPLC analysis (see below), 0.5 μm of the appropriate acyl-CoA standard(s) (Sigma) was added immediately prior to injecting the sample. For analysis by scintillation counting, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of isopropyl alcohol, n-heptane, 1 m H2SO4 (40:10:1, by volume). The residual radioactive free fatty acid was removed by extraction with n-heptane. The aqueous fraction was then counted in a Beckman-Coulter LS6500 scintillation counter to measure synthesis of fatty acyl-CoA (or fatty acyl-AMP when CoA was omitted from the assay). HPLC analysis was performed on a Waters C18 column (30Subrahmanyam S. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4596-4602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The starting condition was 98.8% 50 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5.0) and 1.2% acetonitrile, followed by a gradient of 55% ammonium acetate, 45% acetonitrile over 5 min and then undiluted acetonitrile for 40 min. Radioactivity was monitored by an in-line Beckman 110B Radioisotope Detector with a flow-through scintillation counter. ACS activity was also monitored via thin layer chromatography. The reaction mixture was essentially as described above except that the reaction volume was scaled down to 15 μl. Following incubation of the reaction mixture for 15 min at room temperature, reactions were quenched with 5% acetic acid and loaded on a silica gel thin layer chromatography plate. The products were separated in 1-butanol, acetic acid, water (80:25:40) at 4 °C for about 5 h according to Trivedi et al. (31Trivedi O.A. Arora P. Sridharan V. Tickoo R. Mohanty D. Gokhale R.S. Nature. 2004; 428: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled products were visualized by exposing the TLC plate to Kodak X-AR film for 2 to 3 days. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Samples from whole cell extracts, or the soluble and insoluble fractions were prepared for SDS-PAGE analysis by solubilization by boiling for 5 min in cracking buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 1% SDS). The extracted proteins were loaded on an equal protein basis and separated on an 8% resolving, 4% stacking polyacrylamide gel using a Mini-Protean II apparatus (Bio-Rad). Proteins separated by PAGE were then electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) for 45 min at 100 mV. The membranes were pre-blocked in TBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk powder. The membranes were probed overnight with an anti-pentameric histidine antibody (Qiagen) diluted 1:2000 in the above buffer. Following incubation with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham, 1:5000), the labeled His-tagged proteins were visualized by incubation of the blots in ECL plus chemiluminescent detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and developed on ECL Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). FadK Has Strong Sequence Similarities to ACS Proteins— The crystal structure of Salmonella enterica acetyl-CoA synthetase (32Gulick A.M. Starai V.J. Horswill A.R. Homick K.M. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2866-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) reported after submission of our prior paper (8Campbell J.W. Morgan-Kiss R.M. Cronan Jr., E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) provided structural explanations for the conservation of two ACS motifs called A5 (which lies within a motif called AMP2) and A8 that are found in FadK (Fig. 1A). The A5 sequence is involved in binding the acyl-adenylate intermediate and A8 is involved in binding of both acyl-adenylate and CoA. These data strongly indicated that FadK is an ACS, as we had proposed (8Campbell J.W. Morgan-Kiss R.M. Cronan Jr., E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A third motif called AMP1 that includes a motif called A3 is also present in FadK. However, rather than binding the acyl-adenylate as previously assumed, the AMP1 motif forms a surface loop in acetyl-CoA synthetase that probably binds the pyrophosphate fo"

The caspase family of cysteine proteases plays a conserved role in coordinating programmed cell deaths in multicellular organisms (1Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar). In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a single caspase, CED-3, is sufficient to promote all developmental related programmed cell deaths in this organism (2Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1986; 44: 817-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar, 3Shaham S. Reddien P.W. Davies B. Horvitz H.R. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1655-1671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, although the mechanism of activation of CED-3 by its adaptor CED-4 is relatively well understood, it remains unclear how CED-3 promotes cell death because few substrates for this caspase have been identified. A similar caspase-dependent route to apoptosis has also been elucidated in Drosophila melanogaster involving the CED-4-related protein DARK (also called dApaf-1/HAC-1) and the CED-3-related protease DRONC (4Rodriguez A.

Upon activation, DRONC promotes the activation of several additional fly caspases (9Dorstyn L. Read S. Cakouros D. Huh J.R. Hay B.A. Kumar S. J.

However, as in the nematode context, only a handful of fly caspase substrates, including the fly caspases themselves, the lamin homolog DmO, the caspase inhibitor DIAP-1, and the transcription factor Relish, have been reported to date (9Dorstyn L.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A CED-4-related caspase-adaptor protein, Apaf-1, has also been described in mammals, and this protein acts as a positive regulator of caspase-9 activation in response to diverse forms of cellular stress (14Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar, 15Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6257) Google Scholar). Upon activation within an oligomeric Apaf-1 complex (the apoptosome), caspase-9 propagates a proteolytic cascade involving six additional caspases (caspases-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, and -10), which cooperate to dismantle cellular structures and achieve the morphological and functional end points characteristic of apoptosis (16Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7320-7326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Intensive study of the mammalian cell death-associated caspases has revealed that an array of cellular proteins are targeted for restricted proteolysis during apoptosis (18Fischer U. Janicke R.U. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 76-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). To date, ∼220 substrates for mammalian caspases have been identified, but it is likely that proteolysis of many of these substrates has minimal impact on cell viability, and they fail to be cleaved by caspases in other organisms. However, because the morphological and functional end points of apoptosis are remarkably similar from nematodes to man, this suggests that caspases probably cleave overlapping subsets of substrates in nematodes, flies, and mammals. To address this question, we have used a proteomics-based approach to look for similarities between the repertoire of proteins targeted for caspase-dependent proteolysis during apoptosis of Drosophila S2 cells and the human Jurkat T cell line. This analysis revealed that multiple subunits of the multicatalytic proteasome complex undergo caspase-dependent proteolysis during apoptosis in both organisms. Moreover, proteasome function was observed to decline during CD95-induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells and actinomycin D-induced apoptosis of Drosophila S2 cells. These data suggest that caspase-mediated proteolysis decreases protein turnover by the proteasome and that this is a conserved event in programmed cell death from Drosophila to mammals. Reagents and Antibodies—Staurosporine, actinomycin D, and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma.

The AMC-coupled proteasome substrates (LLVY and LLE), ubiquitin-AMC, and the recombinant isopeptidase T (IsoT) hydrolase were sourced from Affiniti Research Products, Exeter, UK. All antibodies directed against proteasome α, β, 19 S, and 11 S regulator subunits were purchased from Affiniti. Anti-caspase-3, anti-gelsolin, and anti-Rho-GDI antibodies were purchased from BD Laboratories (UK). Anti-caspase-9 was purchased from Oncogene Research Products (UK).

Preparation of Cell-free Extracts—Cell-free extracts of Jurkat and Drosophila S2 subline (D.Mel-2) cells were prepared as described previously (16Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar, 17Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7320-7326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 108 cells were packed into a 2-ml Dounce homogenizer, and an equal volume of ice-cold cell extract buffer (CEB) was added (CEB: 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). For generation of cell-free extracts from Drosophila S2 cells, 250 mm sucrose and 10 mm KCl were added to the CEB. Cells were allowed to swell in CEB for 20 min on ice and were then lysed by homogenization with ∼20-30 strokes of a B-type pestle. Crude extracts were then centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g to remove nuclei, unbroken cells, and other debris. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—For two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, 500 μg of cell-free extract in 350 μl of two-dimensional sample buffer (8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 100 mm DTT, 0.05% SDS, 0.5% ampholyte 3-10, and a trace of bromphenol blue) was rehydrated into 17-cm immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips (Bio-Rad). Passive sample rehydration into IPG strips was performed at room temperature overnight. Isoelectric point focusing was performed in a Bio-Rad Protean Isoelectric Point Focusing Cell under the following conditions: (i) linear voltage ramp to 500 V over 1 h; (ii) 5 h at 500 V; (iii) linear voltage ramp to 3,500 V over 5 h; and (iv) 12 h at 3,500 V. After isoelectric point focusing, the IPG strips were reduced and alkylated with 2% DTT and 2.5% iodoacetic acid, respectively, in 5-min incubations in an equilibration buffer that contained 6 m urea, 375 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol. Strips were then mounted on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using Easymelt agarose (Bio-Rad) and electrophoresed at 37.5 mA/gel in a Bio-Rad Protean II xi electrophoresis cell. Two-dimensional gels were stained using a mass spectrometry-compatible silver staining protocol that is based on a modification of the EMBL silver staining protocol (19Mortz E. Krogh T.N. Vorum H. Gorg A. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1359-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In Gel Protein Digestion and Protein Identification by MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—Protein spots were excised manually from two-dimensional gels. Gel pieces were incubated at room temperature on a shaking platform in oxidation buffer (15 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 50 mm Na2S2O3) until the spots were completely destained. Gel pieces were then washed five times (5-10 min/wash) in 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid. Samples were then incubated in 50 mm NH4HCO3 for 5 min, prior to dehydrating in 100% acetonitrile. To dehydrate the pellets further, the acetonitrile was aspirated off, and the tubes were spun in a Speed-Vac (ThermoSavant) for 5 min at room temperature. For trypsin digestion, a 100 μg/ml aliquot of sequencing grade trypsin (Roche Applied Science) dissolved in 1 mm HCl was diluted 1:10 in digestion buffer (25 mm NH4HCO3, 0.1 n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside). Typically, for low abundance silver-stained spots, 2 μl of trypsin solution (20 ng) was pipetted directly unto the desiccated gel piece. After allowing the gel piece to rehydrate for 5 min, a further 10 μl of digestion buffer was added, and samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C. After trypsin digestion, peptides were extracted twice into 40 μl of 66% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in a sonicating water bath, followed by lyophilization in a Speed-Vac at room temperature. For mass spectrometric analysis, peptides were solubilized by sonication in 5 μl of 5% formic acid. Digested samples (0.5-1 μl) were applied to a Teflon-coated 96-well MALDI target plate (Applied Biosciences) followed by the addition of 0.5-1 μl of a 10 mg/ml matrix solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 60% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were allowed to air dry at room temperature before analysis in positive reflectron mode in a Voyager DE Pro MALDI mass spectrometer (Applied Biosciences). Immunodepletion of Extracts—Jurkat cell-free extracts were immunodepleted of caspase-3 as described previously (16Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar, 17Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7320-7326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A/G beads was coated with 5 μg of anti-caspase-3 antibody by rotation for 3 h at 4 °C. Antibody-coated beads were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline before adding to cell-free extracts. Extracts were immunodepleted overnight at 4 °C under constant rotation, followed by removal of antibody-coated beads by centrifugation. Proteasome, Caspase, and IsoT Substrate Hydrolysis Assays—For synthetic peptide hydrolysis assays, ∼2 μl of cytosolic extract in a final volume of 100 μl of CEB was added to wells of black 96-well Fluotrac 200 plates. AMC-coupled peptides (DEVD, LLE, LLVY) were then added to each well (to a final concentration of 50 μm), and liberation of free AMC was monitored for 1 h at 37 °C at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 465 nm, respectively. AMC-coupled ubiquitin was used to measure the C-terminal hydrolase activity of full-length IsoT, caspase-3, and caspase-3-cleaved IsoT. IsoT (1 μm) was cleaved by 1 μm recombinant caspase-3 by coincubation in 20-μl reaction volumes for 2 h at 37 °C, using protease reaction buffer (20 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, 10 mm DTT). Ubiquitin-AMC hydrolysis assays were carried out in IsoT buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 500 μm EDTA, 3 mm DTT) using a final concentration of 100 nm IsoT, 1.5 μm ubiquitin-AMC and, where appropriate, 5 μm z-VAD-fmk in a final reaction volume of 50 μl. Proteomic Screens for Caspase Substrates in Drosophila and Human Cell Lines—To search for fly caspase substrates, we used Drosophila S2 cells, which are well established to undergo apoptosis in response to inhibitors of protein or RNA synthesis (7Zimmermann K.C. Ricci J.E. Droin N.M. Green D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 9Dorstyn L. Read S. Cakouros D. Huh J.R. Hay B.A. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1089-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 11Fraser A.G. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2805-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). S2 cells exposed to low concentrations of actinomycin D (600 nm) displayed characteristic features of apoptosis, such as extensive membrane blebbing and apoptotic body production within 7 h of exposure to this drug (data not shown). In addition, robust caspase activity, as assessed by hydrolysis of the synthetic caspase substrate DEVD-AMC, was readily detected in apoptotic S2 cell lysates (data not shown). To identify Drosophila caspase substrates, lysates prepared from control and apoptotic S2 cells were normalized for protein loading and were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1A). Protein spots that were reproducibly altered in two-dimensional profiles from control versus apoptotic S2 cell lysates were then excised and identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. A similar analysis was also performed using cell-free extracts generated from human Jurkat T cells triggered to undergo apoptosome-dependent caspase activation by the addition of cytochrome c (Cyt c) and dATP to the extracts (14Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar, 16Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). Control versus apoptotic Jurkat cell-free extracts were also analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B), and altered protein spots were identified by mass spectrometry. A full analysis of the apoptosis-associated alterations that were observed in the Drosophila S2 and human Jurkat cell proteomes will be described elsewhere. However, of the ∼2,000 most abundant Drosophila proteins examined using this approach, we identified 44 protein spots that either disappeared from apoptotic cells or that appeared as cleavage products in these cells (Fig. 1A). Similarly, ∼160 protein spots were observed to undergo caspase-dependent modification in Jurkat cell-free extracts (Fig. 1B). Of the ∼44 potential caspase substrates identified from Drosophila S2 cells, four of these were components of the proteasome complex and were identified as α type 2, α type 4, and β type 4 subunits of the core 20 S proteasome and subunit Rpt1 of the 19 S regulatory complex (Fig. 2A). In addition, we also identified the γ subunit of the 11 S proteasome activator complex (PA28γ) and the ubiquitin-specific protease IsoT as caspase substrates in Jurkat cell-free extracts (Fig. 2B). Collectively, these data suggested that proteasomes and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway enzymes are targeted by caspases during apoptosis of fly and mammalian cells. Caspase-dependent Cleavage of Human Proteasome Subunits—To explore in more detail the possibility that the proteasome is subjected to extensive caspase-dependent proteolysis during apoptosis, we concentrated on the Jurkat system because antibodies are readily available against most of the human proteasome constituents, whereas few are available for their fly counterparts. It has been established previously that addition of Cyt c and dATP to Jurkat cell-free extracts triggers a cascade of caspase activation events involving all of the cell death-associated caspases (16Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). Using this system, we observed that several of the 19 S proteasome regulatory subunits (Rpt5/S6a, Rpn2/S1, and Rpn10/S5a) underwent cleavage upon triggering of caspase activation within Jurkat extracts (Fig. 3, D and E). Moreover, in agreement with our proteomic analysis of the same cells, the proteasomal activator PA28γ was also found to be cleaved in Jurkat extracts after Cyt c/dATP treatment (Fig. 3F). To confirm that apoptosis-associated proteolysis of the proteasome subunits was the result of direct caspase cleavage, Cyt c/dATP-treated extracts were incubated in the presence or absence of the broad specificity caspase inhibitor, ZVAD-fmk. As shown in Fig. 4A, under conditions where caspase activation was blocked by Z-VAD-fmk, cleavage of all of the proteasome-associated subunits was completely abrogated.Fig. 4Cleavage of proteasome subunits requires caspase-3. A, Jurkat cell-free extracts were treated with 50 μg/ml Cyt c and 1 mm dATP to initiate apoptosome-associated caspase activation, in the absence or presence of 5 μm Z-VAD-fmk. Samples were removed at the indicated time points and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific to caspase-3, Rpt2, Rpt5, Rpn2, Rpn10, and PA28γ. Note that the proteolysis of these subunits was blocked in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk. Subunit Rpt2 was included as a negative control. B, Jurkat cell-free extracts were immunodepleted using an anti-caspase-3 monoclonal antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Depletion of caspase-3 was confirmed by immunoblotting. An anti-actin blot serves as a loading control. C, mock-depleted and caspase-3-immunodepleted Jurkat cell-free extracts were treated with 50 μg/ml Cyt c and 1 mm dATP. Samples were removed at the indicated time points and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific to Rpt5, Rpn2, Rpn10, and PA28γ. Note that the proteolysis of all of these subunits was blocked in caspase-3-depleted extracts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Interestingly, although proteomic analyses indicated that three of the core 20 S particle subunits (α type 2, α type 4, and β type 4) were cleaved during apoptosis of Drosophila S2 cells (Fig. 2A), their human counterparts did not appear to be cleaved by caspases (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, although the 26 S proteasome appears to be targeted for proteolysis by caspases in both organisms, different subunits appeared to be involved. It is important to note that although none of the mammalian 20 S core particle subunits were cleaved by caspases, it remains possible that the 19 S regulatory subunits that underwent proteolysis in Jurkat cells may also be cleaved by Drosophila caspases during apoptosis. However, we were unable to explore this possibility because antibodies to these fly proteins were unavailable. Nonetheless, these data confirm that multiple subunits of the regulatory complex of the human proteasome are substrates for caspases activated during apoptosis. Proteolysis of Proteasome Regulatory Subunits Is Mediated by Caspase-3—Triggering of apoptosome activation by Cyt c/dATP is known to activate caspase-9 proximally, followed by caspases-3 and -7, which in turn activate caspases-6, -2, -8, and -10 (16Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J.

Med. 2003; 197: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To determine which of these caspases was responsible for proteolysis of the 19 S proteasome subunits, we generated Jurkat cell-free extracts that were immunodepleted of caspase-3 using a monoclonal antibody specific for this protease (Fig. 4B). Previous analyses have shown that caspase-3 plays a major role in the execution phase of apoptosis (17Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7320-7326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Indeed, whereas mock-depleted cell-free extracts readily supported proteolysis of Rpt5, Rpn2, Rpn10, and PA28γ, immunodepletion of caspase-3 completely abrogated these events (Fig. 4C). Thus, caspase-3 appears to be responsible for the cleavage of several proteasome subunits during apoptosis. Apoptosis-associated Proteolysis of 19 S Proteasome Subunits Is Stimulus-independent—To confirm that 19 S proteasome subunits were targeted for caspase-dependent proteolysis in response to diverse proapoptotic stimuli, Jurkat cells were triggered to undergo apoptosis by exposure to staurosporine, actinomycin D, or UV radiation (Fig. 5). In agreement with the observations made using Jurkat cell-free extracts, Rpt5 (S6a), Rpn2 (S1), Rpn10 (S5a), and PA28γ were cleaved during apoptosis in response to all of the above stimuli (Fig. 5A). Although no specific antibodies were commercially available against the Drosophila orthologs of these proteins, an antibody against human Rpn2 detected the loss of a band of the expected molecular mass in Drosophila S2 cells induced to undergo apoptosis by exposure to actinomycin D or cycloheximide (Fig. 5B). This suggests that, in addition to the subunits identified by proteomic analyses of Drosophila cells (Fig. 2A), Rpn2 (S1) may also be cleaved by caspases during apoptosis in the fly. Proteasome Activity Is Impaired in Apoptotic Cells—To determine whether apoptosis-associated cleavage of proteasome subunits diminished the proteolytic activities of this complex, we assayed proteasome activity in control versus apoptotic Jurkat cells. Similar experiments were also performed on cell lysates derived from control versus apoptotic S2 cells. Cell extracts were generated in the presence of ATP to avoid dissociation of the 19 S regulatory components from the 20 S core particle. The ability of proteasomes in these extracts to hydrolyze the fluorogenic peptides LLE-AMC and LLVY-AMC (a measure of the peptidyl-glutamyl and chymotrypsin-like hydrolase activities of the proteasome, respectively) was then determined (Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, extracts generated from apoptotic cells from both species exhibited robust caspase activity, as assessed by hydrolysis of DEVD-AMC, a synthetic caspase substrate. Significantly, extracts prepared from apoptotic Jurkat cells or from apoptotic Drosophila S2 cells both exhibited reduced LLEase and LLVYase activities compared with their viable counterparts (Fig. 6, A and B). These data suggest that caspase-dependent proteolysis of the proteasome during apoptosis results in a reduction of the proteolytic activities of this protein-degrading complex. IsoT Is Inactivated through Caspase-3-mediated Proteolysis—Our proteomic analyses also identified the deubiquitinating enzyme IsoT as a potential caspase substrate (Fig. 2B). Although not a component of the proteasome complex, this enzyme is thought to be involved in the recycling of ubiquitin through hydrolysis of polyubiquitin chains to monomeric ubiquitin (21Hadari T. Warms J.V. Rose I.A. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 719-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using purified recombinant IsoT, we confirmed that this protein is a substrate for caspase-3 and was cleaved to a fragment of ∼90 kDa after incubation with this caspase in vitro (Fig. 6C). We then examined whether caspase-3-mediated proteolysis of IsoT altered the ability of this enzyme to hydrolyze ubiquitin-conjugated substrates. As shown in Fig. 6D, recombinant IsoT readily hydrolyzed ubiquitin-AMC, whereas caspase-3 was completely ineffective in the same assay. However, after exposure to caspase-3, IsoT exhibited dramatically reduced ubiquitin hydrolase activity (Fig. 6D). Thus, caspase-mediated proteolysis of IsoT is likely to attenuate the ability of the latter to dissemble polyubiquitin adducts during apoptosis, which is likely to have consequences similar to the inactivation of proteasome function, specifically, the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins. Here we have provided evidence that several subunits of the 26 S proteasome complex are cleaved by caspases during apoptosis in Drosophila and man. Although the proteasome subunits that are cleaved during apoptosis in the fly and in man appear distinct (with the possible exception of Rpn2), the functional consequences may be similar. In support of this idea, we also observed a decline in the peptidyl-glutamyl and chymotrypsin-like hydrolase activities of the proteasome during apoptosis of cells from both species. Collectively, these data suggest that proteasomes are conserved substrates of caspases from Drosophila to man and that the decline in proteasome function during apoptosis is at least partly attributable to caspase-mediated proteolysis of these complexes. Our data also provide a molecular basis for previous studies that have reported a decline in proteasome function and accumulation in polyubiquitinated proteins during apoptosis (22Soldatenkov V.A. Dritschilo A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3881-3885PubMed Google Scholar, 23Beyette J. Mason G.G. Murray R.Z. Cohen G.M. Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Canu N. Barbato C. Ciotti M.T. Serafino A. Dus L. Calissano P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 589-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional consequences of proteasome inactivation during apoptosis is unclear. The proteasome complex is involved in multiple cellular functions such as coordination of cell division through the destruction of cyclins, nuclear factor-κB activation, protein turnover, antigen presentation, cell differentiation, and organelle biogenesis (25Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). In all of these situations, proteasomes are involved in the efficient degradation of proteins that are, in most cases, conjugated to polyubiquitin chains. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has also been implicated in the elimination of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins at the onset of apoptosis (8Martin S.J. Cell. 2002; 109: 793-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, targeting of proteasome complexes during apoptosis may serve to shut down diverse cellular functions that rely on the activity of this complex, thereby contributing to the demise of the cell. RNA interference studies in Drosophila S2 cells have shown that perturbation of individual subunits of the 19 S regulatory complex, including those identified as substrates for caspases in the present study (Rpt5, Rpn2, and Rpn10), can result in spontaneous apoptosis (26Wojcik C. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6188-6197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of proteasome function is a well established and efficient means of triggering apoptosis (27Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kawaguchi T. Sugiyama S. Tanaka K. Omura S. Kikuchi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1070-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 28Drexler H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 29Orlowski R.Z. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of proteasome function also sensitize transformed cells to the proapoptotic effects of conventional chemotherapeutics and radiation therapy and have significant clinical potential as a result (30Voorhees P.M. Dees E.C. O'Neil B. Orlowski R.Z. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 6316-6325PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these and other studies suggest that proteasomes are critical for normal cellular function and that interference with the activities of the proteasome has severe consequences for the cell. Thus, caspase-mediated proteolysis of the proteasome may represent an important functional end point of apoptosis through disabling the main protein turnover machinery within the cell. The present study represents the first comparative analysis of caspase substrates between Drosophila and man. Although it is often widely assumed that similar subsets of proteins undergo caspase-dependent proteolysis in nematodes, flies, and mammals, it is important to note that data to support this viewpoint are lacking at present. Although proteasome subunits represented only a small fraction of the proteins that underwent apoptosis-associated proteolysis in both organisms (see Fig. 1), our analyses to date have found surprisingly modest overlap between the proteins cleaved by caspases in the fly and mammals (data not shown). One explanation for this is that these analyses are not exhaustive and only examine the most abundantly expressed fraction of the fly and human proteomes that is accessible by two-dimensional gel analysis. In addition, our preliminary analysis has focused only on the repertoire of caspase substrates detected from a single cell type from each species. Therefore, further studies will be required to scrutinize in more detail the extent of conservation of caspase substrates between divergent species such as humans and flies. However, our work to date has identified a small number of proteins that are cleaved by caspases in both organisms, and these may represent particularly important caspase substrates (data not shown). It is well established that a single C. elegans caspase, CED-3, is critical for all developmental related programmed cell deaths that take place in this organism (2Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1986; 44: 817-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar, 3Shaham S. Reddien P.W. Davies B. Horvitz H.R. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1655-1671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it remains obscure how CED-3 coordinates cell death in the worm because physiological substrates for this caspase remain unknown. Further work is clearly required to identify conserved substrates of worm, fly, and mammalian caspases. Discovery of evolutionarily conserved caspase substrates is likely to shed considerable light upon the strategies used by caspases to kill cells.

https://openalex.org/W2104202542,"Activation of Ras promotes oncogenesis by altering a multiple of cellular processes, such as cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis. Oncogenic Ras can either promote or inhibit apoptosis, depending on the cell type and the nature of the apoptotic stimuli. The response of normal and transformed colonic epithelial cells to the short chain fatty acid butyrate, a physiological regulator of epithelial cell maturation, is also divergent: normal epithelial cells proliferate, and transformed cells undergo apoptosis in response to butyrate. To investigate the role of k-ras mutations in butyrate-induced apoptosis, we utilized HCT116 cells, which harbor an oncogenic k-ras mutation and two isogenic clones with targeted inactivation of the mutant k-ras allele, Hkh2, and Hke-3. We demonstrated that the targeted deletion of the mutant k-ras allele is sufficient to protect epithelial cells from butyrate-induced apoptosis. Consistent with this, we showed that apigenin, a dietary flavonoid that has been shown to inhibit Ras signaling and to reverse transformation of cancer cell lines, prevented butyrate-induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells. To investigate the mechanism whereby activated k-ras sensitizes colonic cells to butyrate, we performed a genome-wide analysis of Ras target genes in the isogenic cell lines HCT116, Hkh2, and Hke-3. The gene exhibiting the greatest down-regulation by the activating k-ras mutation was gelsolin, an actin-binding protein whose expression is frequently reduced or absent in colorectal cancer cell lines and primary tumors. We demonstrated that silencing of gelsolin expression by small interfering RNA sensitized cells to butyrate-induced apoptosis through amplification of the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-7. These data therefore demonstrate that gelsolin protects cells from butyrate-induced apoptosis and suggest that Ras promotes apoptosis, at least in part, through its ability to down-regulate the expression of gelsolin. Activation of Ras promotes oncogenesis by altering a multiple of cellular processes, such as cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis.

These data therefore demonstrate that gelsolin protects cells from butyrate-induced apoptosis and suggest that Ras promotes apoptosis, at least in part, through its ability to down-regulate the expression of gelsolin. The short chain fatty acid butyrate is produced by bacterial fermentation of fiber and represents a primary energy source for normal colonic epithelial cells. Withdrawal of butyrate induces apoptosis, demonstrating that it acts as a survival factor for normal colonic epithelial cells (1Hass R. Busche R. Luciano L. Reale E. Engelhardt W.V.

Biol. 1997; 427: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), suggesting that the butyrate-induced signaling is different in normal epithelium and cancer tissues. Butyrate inhibits proliferation of transformed epithelial cells through up-regulation of p21 and down-regulation of c-Myc; however, the mechanisms whereby butyrate supports survival and promotes proliferation of normal epithelial cells are less well understood. These divergent effects of butyrate are known as the “butyrate paradox.” The availability of alternative energy sources and different metabolic activities of normal and transformed cells have been proposed to underlie the divergent effects of butyrate (3Archer S.Y. Hodin R.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), but molecular mechanisms that could account for the conflicting effects of this short chain fatty acid on normal and transformed colonic epithelial cells have not been determined. In this study we examined whether genetic and epigenetic changes associated with colon cancer regulate the responsiveness of cells to butyrate. Inactivation of the tumor suppressor genes APC 1The abbreviations used are: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; LUC, luciferase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; NaBu, sodium butyrate; siRNA, small interfering RNA; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; NIP, 19-kDa interacting protein. and p53 and activation of the oncogene k-ras underlie the development of the majority of colorectal cancers (11Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4274) Google Scholar). The mutational activation of k-ras, or its downstream signaling effectors, is present in up to 50% of sporadic colorectal tumors (11Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Cancer. 1999; 35: 335-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The majority of the k-ras mutations are gain-of-function mutations at codon 12 and 13, and an activated k-ras has been shown to cooperate with both mutant APC and mutant p53 in the transformation of colonic epithelial cells (13D'Abaco G.M. Whitehead R.H. Burgess A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 884-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14Sevignani C. Wlodarski P. Kirillova J. Mercer W.E. Danielson K.G. Iozzo R.V. Calabretta B. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1572-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that mutations in k-ras may be sufficient to initiate colon tumor development (15Smith G. Carey F.A. Beattie J. Wilkie M.J. Lightfoot T.J. Coxhead J. Garner R.C. Steele R.J. Wolf C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9433-9438Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Accordingly, targeted expression of oncogenic k-ras in intestinal cells resulted in development of intestinal tumors in mice in the absence of detectable inactivating mutations of the tumor suppressor gene APC (16Janssen K.P. el-Marjou F.

Signaling transmitted through Ras results in activation of several downstream effectors, with the MAPK/ERK1/ERK2 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathways playing a crucial role in modulation of the k-ras target genes which in turn regulate processes such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis (17Zuber J.

Regulation of cell survival by Ras is complex, complicated by the fact that activation of Ras, like several other oncogenes, can induce both pro-and antiapoptotic signaling. Ras protects from apoptosis via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/Rac and nuclear factor-κB signaling, and promotes apoptosis through its effectors RASSF1/Nore1/MstI (21Cox A.D. Der C.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8999-9006Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Raf/MEK/ERK signaling can be either anti- or proapoptotic, but the understanding of the downstream targets of Ras that mediate its effect on apoptosis is still far from complete. To determine the role of activated k-ras in butyrate-induced apoptosis and to identify its downstream targets, we used the HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cell line and two clones derived form HCT116 cells with a targeted inactivation of the activated k-ras allele, Hkh2 and Hke-3. Hkh2 and Hke-3 cells are morphologically altered, do not form colonies in soft agar, and fail to form tumors in nude mice (22Shirasawa S. Furuse M. Yokoyama N. Sasazuki T. Science. 1993; 260: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), demonstrating that tumorigenicity of HCT116 cells directly depends on the presence of an activated k-ras allele. In this study we showed that oncogenic activation of a k-ras allele is sufficient to sensitize cells to butyrate-induced apoptosis and that this is, at least in part, mediated through transcriptional down-regulation of gelsolin expression. Gelsolin is a member of a large family of actin-severing and -capping proteins (23Yin H.L. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1979; 281: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). In addition, human gelsolin has been shown to inhibit apoptosis through its ability to block mitochondrial membrane potential and to inhibit caspase activity (24Kwiatkowski D.J. Curr. Opin.

The role of gelsolin in apoptosis is complicated by the fact that gelsolin is also a substrate for caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9 (28Azuma T. Koths K. Flanagan L. Kwiatkowski D. J. Biol.

The anti-apoptotic activity of gelsolin resides in its C terminus and apparently counteracts the proapoptotic activity of the N-terminal domain (27Kusano H. Shimizu S. Koya R.C. Fujita H. Kamada S. Kuzumaki N. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4807-4814Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Overexpression of gelsolin has been shown to reverse transformation of Ras-transformed cells (32Mullauer L. Fujita H. Ishizaki A. Kuzumaki N.

Although no mutations of gelsolin have been described in human cancers, its expression is reduced or absent in ∼60–90% of human colon, breast, bladder, prostate, and stomach cancers (24Kwiatkowski D.J.

Our data demonstrate that Ras mutations may underlie the frequent down-regulation of gelsolin in primary colon cancers (40Bertucci F. Salas S. Eysteries S. Nasser V. Finetti P. Ginestier C.

In addition, our finding that activating mutations of k-ras or silencing of gelsolin sensitizes cells to butyrate-induced apoptosis provides a mechanism for the divergent effects of butyrate on normal and transformed epithelial cells. Cell Lines, Reporter Gene Assay, and Transfections—The HCT116 human cell line was derived from colorectal carcinoma and harbors an activating mutation in codon 13 of the k-ras proto-oncogene. Two isogenic clones of the HCT116 cells with a disrupted mutant k-ras allele, Hkh2 and Hke-3, were generated by homologous recombination (22Shirasawa S. Furuse M. Yokoyama N. Sasazuki T. Science. 1993; 260: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). HCT116 p53–/– cells were kindly provided by Bert Vogelstein. All cells were maintained in minimal Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. The viability of cells was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hke-3 cells were transiently transfected with a series of deletion constructs of the gelsolin promoter in the absence or the presence of RasV12 using a calcium phosphate method (Profection Mammalian Transfection system, Promega, Madison, WI). Transfection efficiency was normalized by cotransfection with pTK-Renilla (dual luciferase reporter assay system, Promega). Results are expressed as the -fold induction of luciferase activity, calculated from the ratio between the activity of the reporter plasmid in cells transfected with an empty vector or different deletion mutants of the gelsolin promoter. Gelsolin expression was silenced using a pool of four siRNAs directed against the coding region of gelsolin (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). Cells were transiently transfected with 5–100 nm gelsolin siRNA using the calcium phosphate method as described above. Immunoblotting was performed using standard procedures (41Klampfer L. Huang J. Sasazuki T. Shirasawa S. Augenlicht L. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 855-862PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for gelsolin were obtained from Sigma, and antibodies recognizing cleaved PARP, caspase-9, and caspase-7 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). cDNA Microarrays—We performed cDNA microarray analysis using microarray slides comprising 8063 cloned sequences produced by the Microarray facility at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen) as suggested by the manufacturer. 100 μg of RNA from HCT116 cells was labeled with Cy3 (channel 1) and RNA from Hke-3 or Hkh2 cells with Cy5 (channel 2) fluorescent dye. After hybridization and washing (42Mariadason J.M. Corner G.A. Augenlicht L.H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4561-4572PubMed Google Scholar), slides were scanned (532 nm/Cy3 and 633 nm/Cy5), and the two images were superimposed and quantified using Scanalyze 1.41 software. Data were imported into an Access data base for further analysis. The expression profile for HCT116 cells is presented as the intensity of channel 1 corrected for the background (ch1I/B), and expression data for Hkh2 or Hke-3 cells as the intensity of channel 2 corrected for the background (ch2I/B). Only genes with a signal/background ratio >1.25 in both Hkh2 and Hke-3 clones were analyzed further. Results are expressed as the ratio between the intensity of signals in HCT116 and Hke-3 cells, or between HCT116 and Hkh2 cells. We considered sequences as potential k-ras target genes if the ratio of the signals between HCT116 and Hkh2/Hke-3 cells was greater than 1.5 (k-ras up-regulated genes) or less than 0.6 (k-ras down-regulated genes). Apoptosis—Adherent and floating cells were collected and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate) and stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide for 4 h at 4 °C. Samples were filtered through a nylon mesh (40-μm pore size) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell cycle distribution and the extent of apoptosis (cells with a sub-G1 DNA content) were analyzed by Modfit software. Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on chamber slides and were either left untreated or were treated with sulindac sulfide for 24 h. Cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol-acetic acid solution (95:5 v/v) for 20 min at –20 °C. Incubation with antibodies recognizing an activated caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology) was performed overnight at 4 °C. Slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with a secondary anti-rabbit antibody, conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate, for 45 min at 37 °C. Samples were examined with a fluorescent microscope and images acquired with a SPOT CCD camera and analyzed by SPOT software. Activating Mutations of k-ras Sensitize Epithelial Cells to Apoptosis—The HCT116 colorectal cancer cell line harbors an activating mutation in the k-ras proto-oncogene. Two clones, Hkh2 and Hke-3, were derived from HCT116 cells by the targeted deletion of the activated k-ras allele, and both clones displayed loss of tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo (22Shirasawa S. Furuse M. Yokoyama N. Sasazuki T. Science. 1993; 260: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). We used these isogenic cell lines to examine whether k-ras mutations modulate the response to butyrate, a dietary chemopreventive agent that exerts different biological activity in normal and transformed epithelial cells. Isogenic cell lines were treated with 3 mm NaBu for 24, 48, or 72 h, and we monitored their viability by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. No major differences in viability among HCT116, Hkh2, and Hke-3 cells were found in the absence of butyrate, and all three isogenic cell lines ceased to proliferate in the presence of butyrate. However, we demon-strated that the viability of HCT116 cells, but not Hkh2 and Hke-3 cells, decreased markedly by the 48-h treatment with 3 mm butyrate (not shown), suggesting that oncogenic activation of k-ras modulates apoptosis in response to butyrate. To determine the role of Ras in butyrate-induced apoptosis, we treated HCT116, Hkh2, and Hke-3 cells with 2 or 5 mm NaBu for 24 h, and the extent of apoptosis was determined by measuring the percentage of cells with a sub-G1 content of DNA, using propidium iodide staining (Fig. 1A) or by staining cells with annexin V, a marker of apoptotic cells (Fig. 1B). Both experiments revealed that HCT116 cells were more sensitive to NaBu-induced apoptosis than the two isogenic clones with a disrupted mutant k-ras allele. Consistently, treatment of cells with 1 mm butyrate was sufficient to induce cleavage of PARP in HCT116 cells, but not in Hkh2 or Hke-3 cells (Fig. 1C). Treatment with 3mm butyrate induced strong accumulation of cleaved PARP in HCT116 cells, but not in Hkh2 cell. In Hke-3 cells, which are, because of clonal variations, somewhat more sensitive to butyrate than the Hkh2 cells (see also 1, A and B), cleavage of PARP occurred upon treatment with 3 mm butyrate, but to a much lower extent than in HCT116 cells. These results demonstrated that the loss of activated Ras is sufficient to confer resistance to NaBu-induced apoptosis. We showed that HCT116 cells were also sensitized to apoptosis induced by suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, another histone deacetylase inhibitor (Fig. 1B), and to 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis, 2L. Klampfer, L.-A. Swaby, J. Huang, T. Sasazuki, S. Shirasawa, and L. Augenlicht, manuscript in preparation. demonstrating that the increased sensitivity of HCT116 cells to apoptosis is not restricted to butyrate. To further determine whether inactivation of the Ras signaling pathways alter the responsiveness of cells to butyrate, we tested the effect of apigenin on butyrate-induced apoptosis. Apigenin is a dietary flavonoid which has been shown to reverse transformation of cells via inhibition of the MAPK kinase activity, a downstream effector of the Ras activated signaling pathway (43Kuo M.L. Yang N.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 44Yin F. Giuliano A.E. Law R.E. Van Herle A.J. Anticancer Res. 2001; 21: 413-420PubMed Google Scholar, 45Yin F. Giuliano A.E. Van Herle A.J. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 4297-4303PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated that apigenin inhibited butyrate-induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). The extent of apoptosis in parental HCT116 cells treated with butyrate and 20 μm apigenin was reduced to levels comparable with those of butyrate-induced apoptosis in Hkh2 and Hke-3 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, apigenin did not have a significant effect on butyrate-induced apoptosis in Hkh2 and Hke-3 cells. The data in Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that the acquisition of a k-ras mutation confers upon colon cells the ability to respond to the physiological regulator of homeostasis, butyrate, by undergoing apoptosis. Conversely, reversal of k-ras-mediated transformation by genetic inactivation of the mutant k-ras allele or pharmacological inhibition of Ras signaling is sufficient to protect cells from butyrate-induced apoptosis. These data therefore established a basis for the differential response of normal and cancer cells to butyrate. Activating Mutation of k-ras Modulates the Expression of Genes Involved in Apoptosis, Including Gelsolin—To define the pathway whereby k-ras signaling promotes butyrate-induced apoptosis, we performed cDNA microarray analysis on the isogenic cell lines that differ by the presence of the mutant k-ras. We considered sequences as potential k-ras target genes if the ratio of the signals between HCT116 and Hkh2 or Hke-3 cells was greater than 1.5 (k-ras up-regulated genes) or less than 0.6 (k-ras down-regulated genes). We identified several sequences that are expressed differentially in HCT116 cells compared with the two clones with a disrupted mutant k-ras allele, among them several known k-ras target genes, such as epiregulin (46Baba I.

Adachi M. Taki T. Inufusa H. Kodama K. Kohno N. Miyake M. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 16: 501-511PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). In addition, we demonstrated that a family of interferon-responsive genes is negatively regulated by Ras signaling through Ras-mediated inhibition of STAT1/STAT2 expression (49Klampfer L. Huang J.

Analysis of the Ras target genes revealed that several genes that modulate apoptosis were also regulated by k-ras signaling (Fig. 3). Bag-1, an antiapoptotic member of the BCL-2 family (50Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar) and gelsolin, an actin-binding protein (23Yin H.L. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1979; 281: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), were down-regulated by an activated k-ras. In contrast, the expression of NIP1, NIP2, and NIP3, a family of proapoptotic proteins, was up-regulated in cells containing the activating k-ras mutation. NIP proteins bear a limited homology to the BCL-2 homology domain 3 and regulate apoptosis by interacting with BCL-2 and BCL-x (51Chen G. Cizeau J. Vande Velde C. Park J.H. Bozek G. Bolton J. Shi L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12415-12421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Another gene up-regulated by oncogenic k-ras was PHLDA1 (pleckstrin homology-like domain, family A), which is a human homolog of the mouse gene TDAG51, which plays a crucial role in activation-induced apoptosis of T cells (53Park C.G. Lee S.Y. Kandala G. Choi Y. Immunity. 1996; 4: 583-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Activation of NIP3 expression by k-ras has been demonstrated recently in fibroblasts (17Zuber J. Tchernitsa O.I. Hinzmann B. Schmitz A.C. Grips M. Hellriegel M. Sers C. Rosenthal A. Schafer R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar); however gelsolin, Bag-1, NIP, NIP2, and PHLDA1 represent potentially novel target genes of activated k-ras. These data demonstrated that genes with known proapoptotic functions, such as NIP1, NIP2, NIP3, and PHLDA1, are up-regulated by activated k-ras, whereas k-ras signaling leads to inhibition of genes with an antiapoptotic function, such as Bag-1 and gelsolin. Such changes may underlie the increased susceptibility of HCT116 cells to butyrate, compared with Hkh2 and Hke-3 cells. The fact that oncogenic activation of Ras inhibited gelsolin expression was of particular interest to us because the expression of gelsolin is known to be reduced or lost in colon cancer (40Bertucci F.

The analysis of 5,6-EET poses problems because of its labile properties, viz. 5,6-EET is rapidly converted to a δ-lactone and/or dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (DHET) in buffers and during sample preparation (19Fulton D.

In this study, we have identified a 5,6-trans-EET in rat red blood cells with GC/MS and HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) analyses. 5,6-trans-EET dilated renal interlobar arteries and inhibited platelet aggregation, suggesting a role for this eicosanoid in circulatory regulation. Materials—Phospholipase A2 (from Naja mossambica mossambica), diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) bromide, N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA), pyridine, and platinum(IV) oxide were obtained from Sigma. Acetonitrile, methanol, and chloroform (all HPLC grade) were purchased from Fisher. Eicosanoid standards were obtained from Cayman, and EET-d8 standards were from Biomol. 14-Week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA. Rats were maintained at 22 °C with alternating cycles of light and darkness and fed ad libitum with standard rat chow and water. RBC Preparation—Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital, 65 mg/kg intraperitoneal (20Fulton D. McGiff J.C. Quilley J. Br. J.

Blood was collected from rats via cardiac puncture using EDTA-rinsed syringes and transferred to Vacuette EDTA tubes (Fisher). Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) powder, 1.2 mg (final concentration 0.2 mm), was added to the 3-ml EDTA tube before blood collection, and the EDTA tubes with collected blood were gently inverted 4–6 times to mix the blood with EDTA and BHT. RBC (3 ml of blood) samples were stored in ice and separated within 20 min by centrifugation at 800 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant and the buffy layer were removed by aspiration. Packed RBCs were washed three times and resuspended in a physiological salt solution (in mm: 4.0 KCl, 2.0 CaCl2, 1.2 MgSO4, 140.5 NaCl, 15.7 Hepes, 11.1 dextrose, and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH adjusted to 7.4) (21Sprague R.S.

Phospholipid Extraction and Hydrolysis—Prepared RBC samples (0.1 ml) were spun down at 2,000 × g, and 2 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) containing 0.1 mm triphenylphosphine (TPP) were added to the RBC pellets, which were then homogenized with frequent vortex mixing for 1 h. The sample was centrifuged at 2,000 × g to remove the cell residues, and the supernatant was transferred to another tube with a Pasteur pipette. The extraction was repeated once. The supernatants were combined, dried under nitrogen, and subjected to hydrolysis using 50 units of phospholipase A2 in 0.5 ml of Tris buffer, pH 8.9, at room temperature for 2 h. The mixture was adjusted to pH 4 with 10% acetic acid, and eicosanoids were extracted twice with 1 ml of ethyl acetate. The use of BHT or TPP is to quench free radicals and to prevent peroxyl radical-propagated transformations of polyunsaturated structures (23Nourooz-Zadeh J. Tajaddini-Sarmadi J. Wolff S.P. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 24Carlin G. J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1985; 1: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The method of Rose and Oklander (25Rose H.G. Oklander M. J. Lipid Res. 1965; 63: 428-431Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) for phospholipid extraction from RBC pellets was also used according to Murphy and co-workers (16Nakamura T. Bratton D.L. Murphy R.C. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 888-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The phospholipid extracted in a final supernatant of chloroform/isopropyl alcohol/water (7:11:1) was dried under nitrogen and followed by phospholipase A2 hydrolysis and ethyl acetate extraction as described above. No difference was observed in terms of identification whether using this method or direct extraction with chloroform/methanol (2:1) containing 0.1 mm TPP from the RBC pellets. The ethyl acetate extract was dried under nitrogen and dissolved in acetonitrile (20 μl) for LC/MS/MS analysis. DIPEA Treatment—Mild alkali catalyzes the unique 5,6-EET conversion to DHET through an intermediary δ-lactone (19Fulton D. Falck J.R. McGiff J.C. Carroll M.A. Quilley J. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1713-1721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For HPLC-GC/MS analysis, the dried ethyl acetate extract was added to a mixture of methanol/water/DIPEA (200:100:15 μl) and heated at 60 °C for 1 h to convert 5,6-EETs to 5,6-DHETs without affecting the other EETs. DIPEA treatment was also used to prepare the 5,6-threo-DHET-d8 from 5,6-cis-EET-d8 methyl ester, which was hydrolyzed according to demethylation protocol from Biomol. This is a moderate treatment compared with the sodium hydroxide hydrolysis of phospholipids that takes 1 h at 60 °C. Hydrogenation—Extracted or standard samples in 0.5 ml of methanol were hydrogenated by bubbling hydrogen for 6 min in the presence of platinum(IV) oxide as a catalyst. HPLC Separations—HPLC was carried out by using a Shimadzu LC-10AT liquid chromatograph with automatic sample injection and programmed fraction collection. A Beckman-Coulter Ultrasphere ODS column (25 cm × 4.6 mm × 5 μm) was used. UV absorbance from 200 to 400 nm was monitored. The four DHETs were completely separated with an isocratic gradient of acetonitrile/water/methanol/acetic acid (60:30:10:0.05) over 20 min, after which an 8-min elution with acetonitrile/methanol/acetic acid (90:10:0.05) was used to wash out all fatty acids in the samples from the column. The HPLC eluent from 8.8 to 10.0 min corresponding 5,6-DHET fraction was collected for further analysis. For separation of 5,6-DHET fraction to threo- and erythro-isomers, the solution of acetonitrile/water/methanol/acetic acid (40:50:10:0.05) was changed over 20 min to acetonitrile/water/methanol/acetic acid (60:30:10:0.05), which was continued for another 10 min. Synthesis of 5,6-trans-EET—Diethyl azodicarboxylate (184 μl, 1.16 mmol) was added to a solution of TPP (303 mg, 1.15 mmol), 4-nitrobenzoic acid (172 mg, 1.03 mmol), methyl threo-5-bromo-6-hydroxyeicosa-8Z,11Z,14Z-trienoate and its 5-hydroxy-6-bromo regioisomer (200 mg, 0.48 mmol) in dry toluene (4.0 ml) under an argon atmosphere at –20 °C (26Corey E.J. Park H. Barton A. Nii Y. Tetrahedron Lett. 1980; 21: 4243-4246Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). After stirring for 4 h at 23 °C, the sample was dried in vacuo, and the residue was purified by SiO2 column chromatography using ethyl acetate/hexane as eluent to give a mixture of inverted benzoate and its 5-(4-nitrobenzoyloxy)-6-bromo regioisomer (220 mg, 81% combined yield). For TLC: ethyl acetate/n-hexane (1:4), Rf = 0.31; 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3), δ 0.88 (t, J = 7.1 Hz, 3H), 1.22–1.38 (m, 7H), 1.65–2.10 (m, 5H), 2.36–2.39 (m, 2H), 2.56–2.89 (m, 7H), 3.65 (s, 1.2H), 3.66 (s, 1.8H), 4.22–4.28 (m, 1H), 5.25–5.43 (m, 5H), 5.45–5.56 (m, 1H), 8.20–8.24 (m, 2H), and 8.28–8.38 (m, 2H). Sodium methoxide (191 mg, 3.54 mmol) was added to the above mixture and its regioisomer (200 mg, 0.35 mmol) in dry methanol (5 ml) at 23 °C under an argon atmosphere. After 30 min, the reaction mixture was diluted with ether (50 ml), and the organic layer was washed with water (three times, 8 ml) and saline (two times, 8 ml) and dried over Na2SO4. Removal of all volatiles in vacuo and purification of the residue by SiO2 preparative thin layer chromatography using CHCl3/C6H6 (1:9) furnished 5,6-trans-epoxy-8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatrienoic acid (5,6-trans-EET) methyl ester (100 mg, 85%). For TLC: CHCl3/C6H6 (1:9), Rf = 0.20; 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 0.89 (t, J = 7.0 Hz, 3H), 1.25–1.39 (m, 6H), 1.49–1.65 (m, 3H), 1.70–1.86 (m, 2H), 2.24–2.31 (m, 1H), 2.35–2.44 (m, 3H), 2.70–2.74 (m, 2H), 2.78 (q, J = 7.0 Hz, 4H), 3.67 (s, 3H), 5.29–5.45 (m, 5H), and 5.48–5.55 (m, 1H). NaOH (1 m aqueous solution, 120 μl, 0.12 mmol) was added to a solution of 5,6-trans-EET methyl ester (10 mg, 0.03 mmol) in THF/H2O (4:1, 2.5 ml). After 12 h, all of the THF was removed in vacuo, and a slurry of SM-2 Bio-Beads (500 mg, 20–50 mesh, Bio-Rad) in water (2 ml) was added to the remaining aqueous solution. After stirring for 30 min, the beads were collected by filtration and rinsed gently with water (100 ml), and then the eicosanoid adhering to the beads was stripped off by using ethanol (25 ml). Concentration of the ethanol washes in vacuo yielded the sodium salt of 5,6-trans-EET (10 mg, 98%). GC/MS Analyses—For quantitation and scan using negative ion chemical ionization (NICI) GC/MS, DHETs and the hydrogenated products were derivatized to form trimethylsilyl (TMS) ether PFB ester (27Chen Y.J. Jiang H. Quilley J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 1292-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The GC column (DB-1ms, 10 m length, 0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.25-μm film thickness, Agilent Technologies Inc.) was temperature programmed from 180 to 300 °C at a rate of 25 °C/min for DHET detection. Methane was used as the reagent gas. The ions m/z of 481 and 489 were monitored for endogenous and deuterium-labeled DHETs. 5,6-EETs were converted to DHETs with DIPEA treatment and a standard curve (r2 >0.99) was constructed by using 5,6-erythro-DHET-d8 as internal standard for the quantitation. For electron ionization (EI) GC/MS analysis, the 5,6-DHETs were derivatized as TMS ether methyl esters with diazomethane (400 μl) at room temperature for 10 min and then dried and treated with 60 μl of BSTFA and 20 μl of pyridine at 60 °C for 5 min. The derivative was dried, dissolved in isooctane, and subjected to GC/MS analysis by using the same column as mentioned above. The column temperature was programmed from 180 to 250 °C at a rate of 15 °C/min. The scan range was from m/z 100 to m/z 550. HPLC-ESI-MS/MS Experiment—Direct identification of EETs was done using a Finnigan LCQ Advantage quadrupole ion-trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source run by Xcalibur software. Instrument lens parameters were tuned with syringe infusion at 5 μl/min of 14,15-EET (0.1 ng/μl) dissolved in HPLC eluent in the negative ionization mode. HPLC was run with a Luna C18 (2Spector A.A. Fang X. Snyder G.D. Weintraub N.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 55-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) 250 × 2.0-mm column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with an isocratic gradient of acetonitrile/water/methanol/acetic acid (60:30:10:0.05) at a flow of 0.30 ml/min. ESI was carried out at an ion transfer tube temperature of 280 °C, a spray voltage of 4.5 kV, a sheath gas flow of 34 units, and an auxiliary gas flow of 5 units (units refer to arbitrary values set by the LCQ software). In the MS/MS experiments, the deprotonated precursor molecular ions [M – H]– of EETs (m/z = 319) were selected and fragmented by helium gas collision in the ion trap at a relative collision energy of 34%. The mass spectra resulting from these fragmentations were acquired with selected reaction monitoring at m/z = 319 for EETs. For quantitative assay of EETs, 2 ng of d8-11,12-EET was added to 100 μl(8 × 108 RBCs) of RBC preparation as internal standard (m/z = 327). A calibration curve for EETs in the range of 0.5 to 8 ng was obtained that showed good correlation (r = 0.99). LC/MS/MS analyses of hydrogenated EETs were carried out under the same conditions except that an isocratic gradient of acetonitrile/water/methanol/acetic acid (75:15:10:0.05) was used, and the precursor ion of hydrogenated EETs (m/z 325) was selected for tandem mass monitoring. Renal Vascular Relaxation—Renal interlobar arteries from Sprague-Dawley rats were cut into ring segments 2 mm in length and mounted on a myograph (J. P. Trading) bathed in Krebs buffer (37 °C) gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 for measurement of isometric tension (mn/mm) (28Zhang F. Wang M.H. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Laniado-Schwartzman M. Nasjletti A. Hypertension. 2001; 38: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The myograph was operated in isometric mode at calculated resting intramural pressure of 100 mm Hg. The interlobar artery rings were preconstricted with phenylephrine (1 μm) to test the arterial relaxation caused by 5,6-trans-EET, 5,6-erythro-DHET, and 5,6-cis-EET at concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 5 μm. Platelet Aggregation—Blood (10 parts), obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats, was drawn into citrate/dextrose (1 part). Platelet-rich plasma was obtained after centrifugation at 1,100 × g for 2 min at 21 °C. A suspension of apyrases (12.5 milliunits/ml) was added, and platelets were removed by centrifugation at 1,100 × g for 15 min at 21 °C. Platelets were resuspended in a modified Tyrode's buffer, pH 6.4, containing 5 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KCl, 5.5 mm glucose, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.2 mm EDTA, recentrifuged at 1,100 × g, and suspended in a buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KCl, 5.5 mm glucose, and 12 mm NaHCO3 at a concentration of 2 × 109/ml. Washed platelets were used for aggregation studies within 3 h of isolation. Aggregation reactions (300 μl) using washed platelets (3 × 108/ml) were conducted at 37 °C using a Chronolog Lumiaggregometer (model 600) in the presence of stirring (800 rpm). Platelets were preincubated with vehicle, 5,6-erythro-DHET, or 5,6-trans-EET 2 min prior to the addition of collagen. Both 5,6-trans-EET and 5,6-erythro-DHET were dried from acetonitrile and suspended into platelet buffer prior to the experiments. Statistical Analyses—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. An unpaired Student's t test and a one-way analysis of variance were performed to test for differences between groups. A value of p < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Conversion of 5,6-trans-EETs to 5,6-DHETs—Conversion of standard 5,6-cis-EET under mild organic alkaline conditions: methanol/water/DIPEA (200:100:15 μl) at 60 °C for 1 h produced a single peak in GC/MS corresponding to 5,6-threo-DHET (Fig. 2A). Without DIPEA treatment, the GC/MS analysis from RBC 5,6-DHET fraction showed only trace amounts of 5,6-threo-DHET and a new peak of similar intensity (Fig. 2B). However, after treatment with DIPEA, the GC/MS ions of 5,6-threo-DHET and the new peak were significantly increased (Fig. 2C), demonstrating the origin of the DHET peaks from corresponding 5,6-EETs in the RBC samples. There were no other detectable DHETs from RBCs either before or after DIPEA treatment of these samples. The NICI GC/MS spectrum of the TMS ether PFB ester of the new peak (Fig. 3) was identical to the GC/MS spectrum of 5,6-threo-DHET. All the evidence suggested that the new peak was 5,6-erythro-DHET that originated from the 5,6-trans-EET in the sn-2 position of phospholipids of RBCs. GC/MS Confirmation of 5,6-trans-EET—To obtain additional confirmation of the structure, 5,6-trans-EET was synthesized and analyzed by NMR to be authentic. DIPEA treatment of 5,6-trans-EET produced a single peak of 5,6-erythro-DHET both in HPLC and GC/MS. By using a gradient of acetonitrile/water/methanol/acetic acid from 40:50:10:0.05 to 60:30:10:0.05 over 20 min, which was continued for another 10 min, the 5,6-erythro-DHET eluted ahead of 5,6-threo-DHET. The retention time was 21.7 min for 5,6-erythro-DHET and 22.6 min for 5,6-threo-DHET (peaks A and B, respectively, in the HPLC inset in Fig. 4). The RBC HPLC 5,6-DHET fraction was further separated with this gradient. Fractions A and B, corresponding to the 5,6-erythro- and 5,6-threo-DHET from RBC samples, were collected and analyzed by GC/MS. The retention times of ion m/z 481 of the TMS ether PFB esters of the two HPLC fractions matched with those of the authentic 5,6-erythro-DHET and 5,6-threo-DHET, respectively (Fig. 4), demonstrating that a pure 5,6-erythro-DHET can be obtained from RBC samples. The minor peak in Fig. 4, Fraction B, indicated that its HPLC fraction may have included a tail of 5,6-erythro-DHET. The EI GC/MS spectrum was used to confirm the molecular breakdown patterns of the 5,6-erythro-DHET. Fraction A was derivatized to TMS ether methyl ester for the analysis. The EI GC/MS spectrum (Fig. 5) of the purified fraction A from RBCs is almost identical to that of the authentic 5,6-erythro-DHET; the EI spectrum does not differ with that of authentic 5,6-threo-DHET. The only difference is the GC retention time of the peaks (Fig. 5, inset). Ions at m/z 203 indicate the molecular breakdown of the TMS ether methyl ester of 5,6-DHET at the C5–C6 position; m/z 215 indicates the breakdown at C6–C7 position with a loss of a TMS group, and m/z 305 is from the breakdown at the C6–C7 position. Hydrogenation of the purified 5,6-erythro-DHET fraction from RBCs resulted in the disappearance of ion at m/z 481 and appearance of ion at m/z 487 for the PFB ester TMS ether derivatives, which is identical to the hydrogenation for authentic 5,6-erythro-DHET. The GC/MS retention times of the hydrogenated products also matched correspondingly (Fig. 6), suggesting the existence of three olefins as well as the 5,6-erythro-dihydroxy structure in the metabolite from RBCs. HPLC-ESI-MS/MS Direct Identification of 5,6-trans-EET— Authentic cis-EETs and the 5,6-trans-EET were well separated with reversed phase HPLC in the experiment (Fig. 7A). LC/MS analysis of the extracts from RBC samples pretreated with 0.2 mm BHT revealed a chromatogram showing eight EET peaks, labeled as 1–4 and t1 to t4 (Fig. 7B). The HPLC retention times of peaks 4 and t4 in RBC samples matched that of authentic 5,6-cis-EET and 5,6-trans-EET, respectively. The ESI-MS/MS spectrum of EETs from RBCs has been reported by Murphy and co-workers (16Nakamura T. Bratton D.L. Murphy R.C. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 888-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The ESI mass spectrum of regioisomeric EETs consisted of a single carboxylate anion [M – H]– at m/z 319. Collisional activation of the carboxylate anion resulted in product ions characteristic of each of the regioisomers of the EETs and also common product ions formed by loss of water (m/z 301), loss of CO2 (m/z 275), and the loss of both water and CO2 (m/z 257) from the [M – H]– ion. The relative abundance of these peaks may vary with different instrumentation and electrospray conditions. There is no consistent difference of the ESI-MS/MS spectra among peaks 4, t4, authentic 5,6-cis-EET, and 5,6-trans-EET (Fig. 8A). Selected reaction monitoring of the unique fragmentation for 5,6-EETs, from m/z 319 → m/z 191, revealed two clear 5,6-EET peaks (Fig. 8B). The match of both the HPLC retention time and ESI-MS/MS spectrum of the peak in RBC samples with authentic 5,6-trans-EET is strong evidence of the existence of 5,6-trans-EET in RBCs. To eliminate the possibility that peak t4 in the sample may be 5,6-cis-epoxide with a combination of trans-double bonds that resulted in the same retention time shift as that exhibited by 5,6-trans-EET, the EET fraction of RBC sample was purified, hydrogenated, and subjected to LC/MS/MS analysis. A match of both the retention times and MS/MS spectra between the authentic standards (Fig. 9A) and the sample (Fig. 9B) for the two reduced 5,6-EET peaks was obtained. The four hydrogenated EET regioisomers can be differentiated with mass spectra as has been done with the nonhydrogenated EETs (16Nakamura T. Bratton D.L. Murphy R.C. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 888-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Selected reaction monitoring of the fragmentation, from m/z 325 → m/z 225, revealed twin peaks for hydrogenated 5,6-EETs (Fig. 9C). The clear separation of these two reduced molecules without double bonds leaves only the geometry of the epoxide being either 5,6-cis or 5,6-trans. The ESI-MS/MS spectra of peaks t1, t2, and t3 matched with corresponding 14,15-, 11,12-, and 8,9-EETs, respectively, both before and after hydrogenation (data not shown). Two peaks for each of these three regioisomers indicated the presence of 14,15-, 11,12-, and 8,9-trans-EETs, respectively. The levels of 5,6-cis- and 5,6-trans-EET in rat red blood cell total phospholipids were 2.23 ± 0.69 and 2.12 ± 0.83 ng/109 RBCs, respectively, as quantitated with LC/MS analysis for three separate samples. The results indicate that there are about the same amount of 5,6-cis- and 5,6-trans-EETs in normal Sprague-Dawley rat red blood cells. The presence of other trans-EETs are evident in Fig. 7B; the levels of 14,15-trans-EET are a little higher than those of 11,12-trans- and 8,9-trans-EETs, which resemble those of the 5,6-trans-EET. The ratios of cis/trans EETs for each regioisomers in the erythrocytes are approximately 1:1. Renal Vascular Effects—The capacity of 5,6-trans-EET to relax rat interlobar arteries preconstricted with phenylephrine exceeded that of 5,6-cis-EET by a significant degree, viz. ED50 was lower by 1 log unit (∼10–8versus 10–7m) and maximum relaxation produced by 5,6-trans-EET was ∼2-fold greater (Fig. 10). The renovascular activity of 5,6-erythro-DHET fell between those of the 5,6-cis- and trans-EETs. Inhibition of Platelet Aggregation—5,6-trans-EET and 5,6-erythro-DHET were tested for their ability to inhibit collagen-induced platelet aggregation at concentrations from 0.1 to 10 μg/ml. At the highest concentration, 5,6-trans-EET inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation, whereas 5,6-erythro-DHET was ineffective (Fig. 11). 5,6-cis-EET produced similar effects to those of 5,6-trans-EET; name"

To investigate the mechanism underlying induction of PAF AH by LPS we used murine RAW264.7 and human THP-1 macrophages as model systems. We found that the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathway mediates transcriptional activation of the PAF AH gene through the participation of nucleotides -68/-316 relative to the transcriptional initiation site. This promoter region spans two Sp1/Sp3 binding sites (SP-A and SP-B) and is necessary and sufficient for the observed effect. Disruption of these Sp binding sites significantly reduces promoter activity in LPS-stimulated cells. The ability of LPS to induce transcriptional activation of PAF AH is not due to enhanced Sp1/Sp3 binding to the promoter but involves enhanced transactivation function of Sp1 via p38 MAPK activation. These studies characterize the mechanism by which LPS modulates expression of PAF AH at the transcriptional level, and they have important implications for our understanding of responses that occur during the development of LPS-mediated inflammatory diseases.

In addition to PAF, administration of LPS to animals and exposure of macrophages in culture to LPS also result in the accumulation of other mediators such as PGE2 and proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α and -β (2Ulevitch R.J.

Arbabi S. Garcia I. Maier R.V. Shock. 2002; 17: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 5Lo C.J. Cryer H.G. Fu M. Kim B. Arch. Surg. 1997; 132: 1342-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The down-regulation of signals elicited by PAF (and PAF-like lipids) is mediated by PAF acetylhydrolases (PAF AHs), calcium-independent phospholipases A2 with specificity for hydrolysis of these lipid mediators (6Stafforini D.M.

Results from studies in patients diagnosed with syndromes in which LPS is thought to participate as a mediator, such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and septic shock have revealed alterations in the secreted form of PAF AH at the activity, protein, and mRNA levels. Endo et al. find that PAF AH activity levels correlate with markers of disease severity such as endotoxin, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-8 (21Endo S. Inada K. Yamashita H. Takakuwa T. Nakae H. Kasai T.

Alveolar macrophages isolated from patients during the acute phase of acute respiratory distress syndrome have been reported to express higher PAF AH activity and mRNA levels compared with alveolar macrophages from patients at risk and healthy subjects (23Grissom C.K. Orme J.F.J. Richer L.D. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Elstad M.R. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 31: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The combination of these observations suggests that LPS or the release of potent downstream mediators during sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and related syndromes results in macrophage activation followed by secretion of phospholipases and other key proteins (24Kim D.K. Fukuda T. Thompson B.T. Cockrill B. Hales C. Bonventre J.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L109-L118PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in PAF AH levels may serve as a compensatory mechanism to down-regulate local and systemic activation mediated by PAF and PAF-like lipids through transcriptional activation of the PAF AH gene (25Cao Y. Stafforini D.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4012-4020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A number of studies, however, reported decreased levels of PAF AH activity in plasma during severe sepsis (26Trimoreau F. Francois B. Desachy A. Besse A. Vignon P. Denizot Y.

Thus, seemingly opposing results have been obtained using relatively small patient populations, a number of different cells and body fluids, and various methodologies to detect PAF AH activity. Consequently, the role of PAF AH in sepsis and related human syndromes remains obscure. In contrast to studies in humans, administration of LPS to experimental animals has consistently resulted in robust increases in the levels of PAF AH at the activity, protein, and mRNA levels during the first 24–48 h (29Howard K.M.

The origin of PAF AH synthesized in response to LPS seems to be limited to cells of the macrophage lineage including tissue macrophages from hepatic (29Howard K.M. Miller J.E. Miwa M. Olson M.S. J.

Okamoto S. Fukunaga K. Shiomi T. Mori T. Iwata M. Ikeda Y. Yamaguchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 511-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) that most of the circulating PAF AH originates in cells of the hematopoietic lineage. The actions of LPS are mediated by TLR4, a member of the toll-like receptor (TLR) superfamily (34Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3926) Google Scholar). LPS associates with LPS-binding protein (LBP) and is delivered to the cell surface receptor CD14. The LPS·LBP·CD14 complex interacts with TLR4 and activates the intracellular mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKK(MKK)) (34Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3926) Google Scholar), leading to stimulation of three distinct MAPKs including p38 MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (35Guha M.

Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 8-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). LPS is thought to activate ERK1/2 via the Ras/Raf-1/MAPK kinase-1 (MKK1 or MEK1) cascade (35Guha M. O'Connell M.A. Pawlinski R. Hollis A. McGovern P. Yan S.F. Stern D. Mackman N. Blood. 2001; 98: 1429-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). On the other hand, p38 MAPK and JNK are phosphorylated and activated by MKK3/6 and MKK4/7, respectively (37Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y.

Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8141-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Active JNK and p38 MAPK participate in the LPS-mediated regulation of diverse pro-inflammatory genes by stimulating multiple transcription factors including the Ap1 complex (c-Jun and c-Fos), ATF-2, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), and C/EBP (39Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanisms that underlie PAF AH up-regulation by LPS, we developed a model system that recapitulates PAF AH responses to LPS similar to those observed in vivo. Second, we established that the ability of LPS to enhance PAF AH expression involves participation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway combined with the presence of essential Sp1/Sp3 binding sites in the PAF AH promoter. Finally, we demonstrated that transactivation by Sp1 is the mechanism by which this transcription factor enhances PAF AH expression. Cell Culture and Reagents—Murine RAW264.7 macrophages were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and were maintained in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hy-Clone). Human THP-1 monocytes overexpressing surface CD14 (generously provided by Dr. Richard Ulevitch, Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, CA) were maintained at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Lipoprotein-free LPS from Salmonella enteriditis (Sigma-Aldrich) was sterilized by γ-irradiation and used at 1 μg/ml unless otherwise specified. The inhibitors SP600125 and PD98059 (Biomol), U0126, SB202190, and SB203580 (Alexis Biochemicals) were dissolved in Me2SO before addition to the culture medium. Cells were treated with LPS and/or inhibitors in the presence of fetal bovine serum. Polyclonal antibodies against PAF AH (N-20), Sp1 (PEP-2), Sp3 (D-20), ERK2 (C-14), and phospho-ERK1/2 (E-4) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The antibodies against JNK, phospho-JNK, p38, and phospho-p38 were from Cell Signaling, and the anti-actin antibody was from ICN. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We used 5 μg of total RNA in reverse transcription reactions performed using a commercially available cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Mouse PAF AH and β-actin cDNAs were amplified as described previously (40Wu X. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. Stafforini D.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 351-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human PAF AH, IL-6, IL-10, and GAPDH cDNAs were amplified using the following primer pairs and parameters: PAF AH, 5′-GAACACACTGGCTTATGGGCAAC (sense) and 5′-GAGTCTGAATAACCGTTGCTCCACC (antisense) (94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 120 s; 30 cycles); IL-10, 5′-ATGCCCCAAGCTGAGAACCAAGACCCA (sense) and 5′-TCTCAAGGGGCTGGGTCAGCTATCCCA (antisense) (94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s; 29 cycles); IL-6, 5′-ATGAACTCCTTCTCCACAAG (sense) and 5′-ACATTTGCCGAAGAGCCCTCAG (anti-sense) (94 °C for 60 s, 58 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 120 s; 25 cycles); GAPDH, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC (sense) and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA (antisense) (94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 60 s, 22 cycles). The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on 1.5% (w/v) agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. Plasmids—All mouse PAF AH promoter constructs (wild-type and mutant) have been described previously (40Wu X. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. Stafforini D.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 351-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate the human promoter construct (-2588/+102-Luc), a genomic region spanning nt -2588/+102 of the human PAF AH gene was amplified by PCR using two BglII-tagged primers (sense, 5′-CGTAAGATCTCCAGACTTCCTACTGCAATCAG; antisense, 5′-GACTTAGATCTTCTCGCCGACAGCACTG) and then cloned into the vector pGL3-Basic (Promega). Dr. Roger Davis (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA) generously provided expression vectors of dominant-negative JNK1 (APF; cloned in pcDNA3) and dominant-negative p38 MAPK (AGF; cloned in pCMV5). The dominant negative mutants of ERK1 (K71R) and ERK2 (K52R) cloned in the pCEP4 vector were kindly provided by Dr. Andrew Thorburn (Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC). The Gal4DBD-Sp1, Gal4DBD-Sp1B, and Gal4DBD-TAT fusion gene plasmids were generous gifts from Dr. Stephen Smale (University of California, Los Angeles, CA). The Gal4DBD control plasmid (pFC2-dbd) and 5× Gal4-TATA-luciferase reporter plasmid (pFR-Luc) were purchased from Stratagene. All plasmids were purified using the endotoxin-free plasmid preparation kit (Qiagen). Transient Transfection and Promoter Activity Assays—We seeded 1 million cells in 35-mm wells, and 18 h later we transfected 2 μg of promoter reporter constructs for 4 h using LipofectAMINE-PLUS (Promega). After transfection, we washed the cells with 1× phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with fresh medium for 6 h, added 1 μg/ml LPS, and continued the incubations for 24 additional hours. The cells were lysed using 200 μl per well of Reporter lysis buffer (Promega), the total protein content was determined (Pierce), and the luciferase activity (luciferase assay system, Promega) was assayed in the supernatants. For co-transfection assays, both the promoter and the protein expression constructs (1 μg each) were transfected, as above. Western Blot Analyses—After stimulation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1× lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). After sonication, the cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. We subjected 30 μg of protein to electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred the proteins to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membrane was then blocked in 1× TBST buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk and then probed with the primary antibody indicated in each case at 4 °C overnight. After three washes in 1× TBST, the membrane was exposed to a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (BIOSOURCE) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using chemiluminescence detection reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Kinase Activity Assays—The cellular activities of p38 MAPK and JNK were measured using p38 MAPK and JNK assay kits from Cell Signaling following the instructions suggested by the manufacturer. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear protein extraction and EMSA assays were performed as described previously (40Wu X. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. Stafforini D.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 351-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS Induces Plasma PAF AH Expression in Cultured Macrophage Cell Lines—Previous reports in which LPS was tested for its ability to alter PAF AH expression in cell culture failed to reproduce the characteristic increase in activity shown using in vivo approaches (29Howard K.M.

These studies employed terminally differentiated macrophages and reported decreased PAF AH activity (41Narahara H. Frenkel R.A. Johnston J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 42Narahara H. Johnston J.M. Am. J. Obstet.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27543-27548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) levels upon exposure to LPS. To examine if the in vivo responses to LPS were recapitulated using cells at an earlier stage of differentiation, we used the murine peritoneal monocyte/macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and a human monocytic cell line overexpressing CD14 (THP-1/CD14). Resting RAW264.7 and THP-1/CD-14 cells expressed extremely low levels of PAF AH mRNA (Fig. 1, A and B) and protein (Fig. 1C), thus resembling the characteristic phenotype of primary human monocytes (43Elstad M.R. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8467-8470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation with LPS at low concentrations (1–10 ng/ml) consistently increased PAF AH mRNA levels; maximal expression was observed at 1 μg/ml LPS (Fig. 1, A and B). In a time-course analysis, PAF AH mRNA levels were increased 3 h after the addition of 1 μg/ml LPS and were sustained up to 12 h after stimulation (Fig. 1, A and B). These changes were followed by robust increases in PAF AH protein that remained elevated for at least 24 h (Fig. 1C). The p38 MAPK Pathway Mediates LPS Induction of PAF AH mRNA in Macrophages—Previous studies have shown that LPS activates multiple pathways including those involving MAPK participation (36Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 8-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Our next goal was to elucidate the signaling pathway(s) that participates in LPS-mediated up-regulation of PAF AH expression. We initially examined the effect of various MAPK inhibitors on the ability of LPS to up-regulate PAF AH expression in RAW264.7 cells. We found (Fig. 2A) that the p38 MAPK inhibitors SB203580 (10 μm) and SB202190 (15 μm) completely prevented LPS-mediated up-regulation of PAF AH mRNA in RAW264.7 cells. The inhibitor SB203580 attenuated the phosphorylation of ATF-2, a reaction catalyzed by p38 MAPK (Fig. 2B) and had no effect on ERK and JNK activation, as expected (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 had no effect on the up-regulation of PAF AH mediated by LPS but were effective inhibitors of ERK and JNK activation, respectively (Fig. 2B). We also observed (Fig. 2C) a robust increase in PAF AH mRNA levels after LPS stimulation of human THP-1/CD14 cells. The stimulation of human PAF AH mRNA production was almost completely inhibited by p38 MAPK inhibitors (Fig. 2D), which were also effective inhibitors of LPS-mediated up-regulation of IL-10 mRNA levels, as expected (44Ma W. Lim W. Gee K. Aucoin S. Nandan D. Kozlowski M. Diaz-Mitoma F. Kumar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13664-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ability of LPS to mediate up-regulation of PAF AH mRNA levels was completely independent of MEK1/2 activation because supplementation of U0126 was without effect (Fig. 2, A and C). The effectiveness of U0126 as a MEK1/2 inhibitor was demonstrated by its ability to inhibit the increase in IL-6 mRNA levels in response to LPS, a process that requires active MEK1/2 (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrate the participation of p38 MAPK, but not ERK or JNK, as one of the key intermediates in the ability of LPS to induce expression of PAF AH mRNA in cells of the monocytic lineage. The Proximal Region of the PAF AH Promoter Participates in LPS-mediated Increases in PAF AH mRNA Levels; Role of p38 MAPK—The effect of LPS on PAF AH mRNA levels could be due to increased mRNA synthesis, increased stability, or both. We first investigated what regions of the PAF AH promoter are necessary for the observed effects. We transfected RAW264.7 cells with various mouse and human PAF AH promoter constructs fused to a luciferase reporter and then stimulated the cells with LPS for 24 h. We found (Fig. 3A) that LPS treatment increased the activity of the transfected human and mouse promoter constructs by 4–5-fold. In contrast, the promoter activity of the backbone vector (pGL3-Basic) was only moderately increased by LPS (1.8-fold, data not shown). These data suggest that one of the mechanisms by which LPS up-regulates expression of PAF AH includes transcriptional activation. We next investigated whether the participation of p38 MAPK in LPS-mediated effects occurred at the promoter level using dominant-negative constructs of various MAPKs. We co-transfected RAW264.7 macrophages with the mouse PAF AH promoter construct that spans nt -1806/+86 and an expression plasmid encoding either dominant-negative ERK1 (dnERK1), ERK2 (dnERK2), JNK1 (dnJNK1), or p38 MAPKα (dnp38α). We found (Fig. 3B) that promoter activation mediated by LPS was completely abolished by overexpression of dnp38α; in contrast, expression of dnERK1, dnERK2, or dnJNK1 had no effect. These results demonstrate that LPS-induced PAF AH expression requires participation of the p38 MAPK pathway at the transcriptional level. To precisely map the promoter regions necessary for LPS-mediated effects, we transfected RAW264.7 cells with a series of previously characterized mouse promoter constructs fused to a luciferase reporter (40Wu X. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. Stafforini D.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 351-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All the promoter constructs exhibited 4–5-fold LPS-dependent increases in promoter activity except a very short construct, which spanned nt -68/+86 (2.2-fold activation, Fig. 3C). The minimal sequence necessary for maximal LPS-dependent promoter activation included 316 nt up-stream of the transcriptional initiation site of the mouse gene. This 316-nt sequence contained elements targeted by the p38 MAPK pathway as co-expression of dnp38α, but not dnERK1,"

We created a series of Tsg101 conditional knock-out cell lines that lack p53, p21Cip1, or p19Arf to determine the involvement of the Mdm2-p53 circuit as a regulator for G1/S progression and cell death. In this new report we show that the cell cycle arrest in Tsg101-deficient cells is p53-dependent, but a null mutation of the p53 gene is unable to maintain cell survival. The deletion of the Cdkn1a gene in Tsg101 conditional knock-out cells resulted in G1/S progression, suggesting that the p53-dependent G1 arrest in the Tsg101 knock-out is mediated by p21Cip1. The Cre-mediated excision of Tsg101 in immortalized fibroblasts that lack p19Arf seemed not to alter the ability of Mdm2 to sequester p53, and the p21-mediated G1 arrest was not restored. Based on these findings, we propose that the p21-dependent cell cycle arrest in Tsg101-deficient cells is an indirect consequence of cellular stress and not caused by a direct effect of Tsg101 on Mdm2 function as previously suggested. Finally, the deletion of Tsg101 from primary tumor cells that express mutant p53 and that lack p21Cip1 expression results in cell death, suggesting that additional transforming mutations during tumorigenesis do not affect the important role of Tsg101 for cell survival.

The tumor susceptibility gene 101 (Tsg101) encodes a multidomain protein that mediates a variety of biological functions. Some of these functions have been postulated from the predicted protein structure, its intracellular localization, the identification of Tsg101-binding proteins, and very recently, the generation of Tsg101-deficient mouse models. These functions include a role in ubiquitination (1Koonin E.V. Abagyan R.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 330-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 2Ponting C.P. Cai Y.D. Bork P. J. Mol.

The C-terminal coiled-coil domain of Tsg101, formally known as CC2, was isolated first in a yeast two-hybrid screen with the cell growth regulating protein Stathmin (14Maucuer A. Camonis J.H.

Cell. 1996; 85: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of Tsg101 (UEV domain) is similar to the catalytic domain of ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes. Because Tsg101 lacks a key cysteine residue found in authentic E2 enzymes, it has been postulated that this protein might serve as a negative regulator for the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of other proteins (1Koonin E.V.

Suggested targets of important factors for cell cycle regulation whose stability and function were affected by Tsg101 are Mdm2 and p21Cip1 (17Li L. Liao J. Ruland J. Mak T.W. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl.

The excision of the Tsg101 gene in primary cultures of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) or mammary epithelial cells (MECs) revealed that Tsg101-deficient cells arrested at the G1/S transitional phase of the cell cycle before they underwent cell death (12Krempler A.

Sirard C. Elia A. MacPherson D. Wakeham A. Li L. Luis D.L.P. Cohen S.N. Mak T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1859-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 12Krempler A.

Cell cycle arrest at the G1/S checkpoint and cell death were two major phenomena that we observed in the Tsg101 conditional knock-out model (12Krempler A. Henry M.D. Triplett A.A. Wagner K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43216-43223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 13Wagner K.U. Krempler A. Qi Y. Park K. Henry M.D. Triplett A.A. Riedlinger G. Rucker III, E.B. Hennighausen L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 150-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The analysis of crucial regulators of the cell cycle revealed that Tsg101 deficiency resulted in growth arrest through the inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2). Consequently, DNA replication was not initiated in Tsg101-deficient cells before they died (12Krempler A. Henry M.D. Triplett A.A. Wagner K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43216-43223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A crucial regulatory mechanism, which is commonly associated with G1 arrest and cell death, is the p19Arf-Mdm2-p53 tumor-surveillance or stress-response pathway (20Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2984-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to further discriminate the p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms that lead to either cell cycle arrest or cell death as a consequence of Tsg101 deficiency. We now show that the G1 arrest in Tsg101-deficient cells is dependent upon the presence of functional p53 and its downstream mediator p21Cip1. Our findings suggest that, in contrast to keratinocytes (18Oh H. Mammucari C. Nenci A. Cabodi S. Cohen S.N. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5430-5435Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), Tsg101 is not required for p21Cip1 protein stability and function in proliferating fibroblasts. The absence of either p53 (and, therefore, p21) or p21Cip1 alone is, however, unable to sustain cell survival. In addition to these findings in vitro, a null mutation of the p53 gene does not restore normal mammogenesis and lactation in Tsg101 mammary-specific knockout mice (WAP-Cre Tsg101fl/fl p53-/-). To address the proposed role of Tsg101 as a crucial regulator for Mdm2 function (17Li L. Liao J. Ruland J. Mak T.W. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1619-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we have generated a conditional double-knock-out of Tsg101 and Cdkn2a. The deletion of Tsg101 in immortalized fibroblasts that lack expression of p19Arf does not alter Mdm2 function and does not restore the p21-mediated G1 arrest. In summary, our data do not support a biologically relevant function of Tsg101 as a stabilizer for Mdm2. Therefore, we propose that the p21-mediated induction of the G1 arrest might be an indirect consequence of Tsg101 deficiency due to cellular dysfunction and stress. Finally, we show that the deletion of Tsg101 from tumorigenic cells that express mutant p53 and that lack p21Cip1 expression results in cell death. This observation suggests that additional, transforming mutations during tumorigenesis do not affect the important role of Tsg101 for cell survival. Mouse Models, Genotyping Protocols, and Whole Mount Analysis of Mammary Glands—The PCR protocol for genotyping the whey acidic protein (WAP)-Cre mice (TgN(Wap-cre)11738Mam) as well as the generation and phenotypic characterization of Tsg101 conditional knock-out mice (Tsg101tm1Kuw) have been described earlier (13Wagner K.U.

Athymic nude mice (NCr strain, NCI) were used for transplantation studies. The preparation and staining of mammary gland whole mounts were described previously (13Wagner K.U. Krempler A. Qi Y.

All animals used in the studies were treated humanely and in accordance with federal guidelines and institutional policies. Primary Cell Cultures and Retroviral Expression Vectors—MEFs from 13.5- or 14.5-day-old Tsg101fl/fl, Tsg101fl/fl p53-/-, Tsg101fl/fl Cdkn1a-/-, or Tsg101fl/fl Cdkn2a-/- embryos and their littermate controls were explanted and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 10 μg/ml gentamycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells at passages 2–4 were plated at a density of 4 × 105 cells/10-cm culture dish and infected with the pBabe and pBabe-Cre constructs. The generation of these retroviral vectors was published previously (12Krempler A. Henry M.D. Triplett A.A. Wagner K.U. J. Biol.

Forty-eight hours after infection cells were selected in complete medium containing 7 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) or 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Cell Cycle Analysis and 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) Assay—Approximately 106 MEFs were harvested 4 days after puromycin selection to determine cell cycle progression using a flow cytometric analysis. Cells were washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 30 min. After an additional washing step, cells were stained overnight with propidium iodide as described previously (26Telford W.G. King L.E. Fraker P.J. Cell Prolif. 1991; 24: 447-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The stained MEFs were analyzed in a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer. The software packages CELLquest (BD Biosciences) and Modfit LT (Verity) were used for data acquisition. The cell cycle analysis was repeated three or four times for each experimental setting, and a t test was performed to validate statistically significant differences between the various double knock-out cell lines and their controls. An MTT growth assay was performed as described earlier (27van de Loosdrecht A.A. Beelen R.H. Ossenkoppele G.J. Broekhoven M.G. Langenhuijsen M.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 174: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) to determine the growth properties of Tsg101/p53 double knock-out cells. The MTT was obtained from Sigma. 2 × 104 cells of each genotype were seeded in triplicates in a 96-well microtiter plate. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm with an Elx 808 (Bio-Tek Instruments) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Western Blot Analysis and Cdk2 Kinase Assay—MEFs were pelleted and lysed on wet ice for 30 min in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Protein was quantified using a Bradford assay (Pierce) according to the manufacture's protocol. Approximately 50–100 μg of protein per lane was resolved on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gradient gel and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Invitrogen). The membranes were blocked for 1 h in 1× Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% dry milk. Subsequently, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight, washed 3 times for 15 min in washing buffer (1× Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20), and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in blocking buffer. Membranes were washed again 3 times in washing buffer and once for 15 min in 1× Tris-buffered saline without Tween 20. Protein bands were detected using the ECL chemiluminescence kit for Western blot analysis (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacture's protocol. Membranes were stripped using 0.2 m NaOH for consecutive detection of various proteins. The following antibodies were used in this study: α-Tsg101 (C-2), α-cyclin B1 (M-20), α-cyclin A2 (C-19), α-p16Ink4a (M-156), and α-ActB (I-19) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology as well as α-p21Cip1 (SX118) from Pharmingen and α-p19Arf (Ab-1) from Oncogene at a 1:1000 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used at a 1:1000 dilution. A Cdk2 kinase assay was performed using the α-Cdk2 (M-2) antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Histone H1 (1 μg/μl) from Sigma. A Null Mutation of p53 Does Not Rescue the Deleterious Phenotype Caused by Tsg101 Deficiency in Vitro and in Vivo— The Cre-mediated excision of both Tsg101 floxed alleles from proliferating primary fibroblasts (MEFs) and MECs resulted in cell cycle arrest and cell death (12Krempler A.

The activation of the p19Arf-Mdm2-p53 stress-response pathway is frequently associated with both phenomena. To further discriminate the p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms that lead to either cell cycle arrest or cell death as a consequence of Tsg101 deficiency, we derived MEFs from Tsg101 conditional knockout mice (Tsg101fl/fl) that carry a targeted null mutation of the p53 gene (22Donehower L.A. Harvey M. Slagle B.L. McArthur M.J. Montgomery Jr., C.A. Butel J.S. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (4054) Google Scholar). Cells treated with a control virus (pBabe) or a retrovirus expressing Cre recombinase (pBabe-Cre) were grown for 7 days after infection to quantitatively examine the growth of Tsg101 knock-out cells in the presence or absence of p53. The multiplication of Tsg101-deficient MEFs and their controls were determined using an MTT assay between days four through seven post-infection when optimal puromycin selection, expression of Cre, and excision of Tsg101 had been achieved (Fig. 1A). The Cre-mediated deletion of Tsg101 resulted in a severe growth inhibition and reduction in the number of viable cells. More importantly, we did not observe a significant modification of growth properties or prolonged cell survival in the presence or absence of one or both copies of the p53 gene. Our data suggested that a p53 null mutation was neither able to rescue growth inhibition nor significantly modify the rate of cell death of Tsg101-deficient primary fibroblasts. We have shown in a control experiment that the expression of Cre recombinase can be excluded as a cause or possible modifier of this phenotype. Tsg101 wild type cells (Tsg101+/+) infected with the retroviral pBabe-Cre vector did not exhibit growth retardation in an MTT assay. In addition, we were able to rescue the deleterious phenotype of Tsg101-/- cells through the expression of exogenous, hemagglutinin-tagged Tsg101 from a retroviral vector (12Krempler A.

To verify these initial findings in a different cell type and in vivo, we bred two mutant p53 alleles into mammary-specific Tsg101 conditional knock-out mice (WAP-Cre Tsg101fl/fl p53-/-). The expression of Cre under the WAP promoter is largely confined to differentiating mammary epithelial cells in late-pregnant and lactating females (21Wagner K.U. Wall R.J. St-Onge L. Gruss P.

In contrast to littermate controls (Tsg101fl/fl p53+/+), the WAP-Cre-mediated deletion of Tsg101 in a p53 wild type background (WAP-Cre Tsg101fl/fl p53+/+) resulted in impaired mammogenesis at the onset of lactation (Fig. 1B). The introduction of two mutant copies of the p53 gene into the Tsg101 conditional knock-out (WAP-Cre Tsg101fl/fl p53-/-) was unable to rescue impaired mammogenesis caused by the WAP-Cre-mediated excision of the two floxed Tsg101 alleles. Therefore, our observations in mutant female mice were consistent with the cell culture studies on Tsg101/p53 double mutant MEFs. Taken together, the outcome of both studies (in vitro and in vivo) suggests that the inability of a p53 null mutation to rescue a Tsg101-deficient phenotype is neither a cell culture phenomenon nor is it caused by a possible difference in p53 function between different cell types of mesodermal and ectodermal origin (i.e. fibroblasts and mammary epithelial cells). Deletion of p53 in Tsg101-deficient Cells Restores the Activity of Cdk2 and Progression into the S Phase—Despite p53-independent mechanisms that trigger the dominant phenotype (i.e. lethality) of Tsg101-/- cells, we postulated that deficiency of p53 might modify or even eliminate the cell cycle arrest in Tsg101-deficient cells before they die. To address this hypothesis, we analyzed the cell cycle progression of Tsg101 null cells lacking one or two copies of the p53 gene. The Cre-mediated deletion of Tsg101 in MEFs with a heterozygous null mutation of p53 (Tsg101fl/fl p53+/- pBabe-Cre) leads to a significant reduction in the number of cells in S phase (Fig. 2A) (p < 0.01; t test), a decrease of the cyclin A2 protein level (Fig. 2B, third lane), and the inactivation of the Cdk2 (Fig. 2C). Consequently, the inhibition of only one p53 allele had no effect on impaired G1/S progression of Tsg101-/- cells, and the consequences of Tsg101 deficiency were identical to cells with two functional copies of p53 (12Krempler A. Henry M.D. Triplett A.A. Wagner K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43216-43223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, the deletion of both p53 alleles in Tsg101 conditional knock-out MEFs (Tsg101fl/fl p53-/- pBabe-Cre) re-established a normal G1/S progression (Fig. 2A) (p < 0.02; t test), increased the expression of cyclins A2 (Fig. 2B), and restored the activation of Cdk2 (Fig. 2C). In summary, these observations confirm our previously stated hypothesis that p53 deficiency is able to lift the G1 cell cycle arrest and to revert part of the complex phenotype of Tsg101 knock-out cells despite its inability to sustain cell survival. P21Cip1 Is a Mediator of the G1 Cell Cycle Arrest in Tsg101 Conditional Knock-out Cells—The activity of Cdk2 in complex with cyclin E is negatively regulated by the cell cycle inhibitor p21Cip1 whose expression level is dependent upon the transcriptional activation of p53 (28el Deiry W.S.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that p21Cip1 might be a component of the p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in response to Tsg101 deficiency. To address this issue, we bred Cdkn1a-/- mice (23Brugarolas J. Chandrasekaran C. Gordon J.I. Beach D. Jacks T. Hannon G.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar) into the Tsg101-floxed background (Tsg101fl/fl p21-/-) to generate MEFs that lack expression of p21 and Tsg101 after infection with pBabe-Cre and selection with puromycin (Fig. 3A). The infection of p21Cip1-deficient cells with the control vector pBabe and selection with puromycin had little or no consequences on the viability and multiplication of primary cells. The Cre-mediated excision of only one floxed allele of Tsg101 (Tsg101fl/+p21-/- pBabe-Cre) also did not affect the survival and G1/S progression of p21Cip1-deficient MEFs as determined by flow cytometry (Fig. 3B). The deletion of two floxed alleles of Tsg101 (Tsg101fl/fl p21-/- pBabe-Cre) progressively led to the death of Tsg101-deficient MEFs within 7 days after infection with the retroviral Cre vector (data not shown). Like the deletion or functional inhibition of p53, a null mutation of the Cdkn1a gene was, however, able to restore the G1/S progression in cells lacking Tsg101 (Fig. 3B). The average number of cells in S phase was not significantly different between the double knock-out cells and their controls (p > 0.05). The relative increase in a subset of cells at the G2/M phase is probably caused by the puromycin selection since we observed the same phenomenon when these cells where infected with the pBabe vector control. Collectively our findings confirmed the working hypothesis, which predicted that p21Cip1 is a mediator of the G1 cell cycle arrest in Tsg101-deficient cells.

The mechanism of coupling between conformational activation and Pm formation was investigated in kinetic studies. Parabolic time courses of Pg activation by SK monitored by chromogenic substrate hydrolysis had initial rates (v1) representing conformational activation and subsequent rates of activity increase (v2) corresponding to the rate of Pm generation determined by a specific discontinuous assay. The v2 dependence on SK concentration for [Lys]Pg showed a maximum rate at a Pg to SK ratio of ∼2:1, with inhibition at high SK concentrations. [Glu]Pg and [Lys]Pg activation showed similar kinetic behavior but much slower activation of [Glu]Pg, due to an ∼12-fold lower affinity for SK and an ∼20-fold lower kcat/Km. Blocking lysine-binding sites on Pg inhibited SK·Pg* cleavage of [Lys]Pg to a rate comparable with that of [Glu]Pg, whereas [Glu]Pg activation was not significantly affected. The results support a kinetic mechanism in which SK activates Pg conformationally by rapid equilibrium formation of the SK·Pg* complex, followed by intermolecular cleavage of Pg to Pm by SK·Pg* and subsequent cleavage of Pg by SK·Pm. A unified model of SK-induced Pg activation suggests that generation of initial Pm by SK·Pg* acts as a self-limiting triggering mechanism to initiate production of one SK equivalent of SK·Pm, which then converts the remaining free Pg to Pm.

The domain organization of the circulating form of Pg ([Glu]Pg) consists of a 77-residue N-terminal peptide, five kringle domains, and a serine proteinase catalytic domain that is activated by cleavage at Arg561–Val562 (2Henkin J.

The mechanism of Pg activation by SK is unique in that SK binding to Pg results in expression of an active catalytic site on the zymogen by a conformational change, without the normally required peptide bond cleavage (12McClintock D.K.

Conformational activation is followed by proteolytic conversion of Pg to Pm by cleavage of Arg561–Val562, and SK bound to Pm propagates proteolytic Pg activation. Recognition of Pg as a substrate of SK·Pm is mediated by expression of a specific substrate recognition exosite on the SK·Pm complex (14Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C.

Both conformational and proteolytic activation reactions are known to contribute to SK-induced Pg activation, but different interpretations of the mechanism of conformational activation and its coupling to subsequent proteolytic Pm formation have been postulated.

The activation equilibrium is more favorable for Pg species with an extended conformation, [Lys]Pg and [Glu]Pg at low chloride concentration (4Violand B.N. Byrne R. Castellino F.J. J. Biol.

Previous steady-state kinetic studies of SK-initiated Pm formation concluded that Pm was formed initially by intramolecular proteolytic activation of Pg within the conformationally activated SK·Pg* complex (20Kosow D.P. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4459-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The subsequent findings that SK·Pm did not catalyze a mixture of SK, Pg, and bovine trypsin inhibitor to Pm and the resistance of diisopropyl fluorophosphate-inactivated SK·Pg* to Pg activators also supported the intramolecular cleavage hypothesis (21Bajaj A.P.

The large difference in affinity may result in displacement of Pg from the SK·Pg* complex by Pm, forming the very stable proteolytic Pg activator complex SK·Pm. The pathway of Pm generation from SK·Pg* and the source of SK·Pm are unclear, in part because of conflicting evidence for the intramolecular and intermolecular mechanisms. The role of lysine-binding sites on the kringle domains of Pg and Pm in the mechanism of SK-induced Pg activation is also only partly understood. The lysine analog, 6-aminohexanoic acid (6-AHA), partially reduces binding affinity of SK for [Lys]Pg in parallel with inhibition of conformational activation, but does not affect [Glu]Pg (16Boxrud P.D.

It appears that the affinity of SK binding to Pg and subsequent proteolytic formation of Pm are both inhibited by 6-AHA, but the relationship between these sources of inhibition and the basis for the differential effect on [Glu]Pg and [Lys]Pg activation are not clear.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The goal of the present studies was to apply the results of previous equilibrium binding and kinetic studies of SK-Pg and SK-Pm interactions in combination with initial rate kinetic analysis to define the coupling of conformational Pg activation to the proteolytic activation pathway of SK-induced Pm formation. The studies address the unresolved mechanism of proteolytic Pm formation, the relationship between catalysis by SK·Pg* and SK·Pm complexes, and regulation of these events by lysine-binding site interactions. The kinetics of proteolytic Pg activation and inhibition of Pm formation by saturating SK concentrations observed here is explained by a mechanism in which Pm is formed by intermolecular cleavage of Pg by the SK·Pg* complex. The binding and conformational activation equilibrium for [Lys]Pg, characterized in the companion paper (16Boxrud P.D. Verhamme I.M. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36633-36641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), is partially facilitated by lysine-binding site interactions, whereas subsequent Pm formation is greatly dependent on these interactions. By contrast, the independence of [Glu]Pg conformational and proteolytic activation on lysine-binding sites accounts for the higher substrate specificity of the SK·Pg* complex for [Lys]Pg compared with [Glu]Pg. The combined equilibrium binding and kinetic data do not support a significant role for intramolecular Pm formation within the SK·Pg* complex. The studies provide the first quantitative kinetic analysis of the pathway of Pm formation by SK and demonstrate the critical role of differences in SK affinity for Pg activation species and the differential roles of lysine-binding site interactions in initiating and propagating the activation mechanism. A unified kinetic mechanism of Pg activation suggests that the activation process at concentrations of Pg » SK is triggered by a self-limiting initial cycle of Pm formation catalyzed by SK·Pg* that results in sequestering of SK in the SK·Pm complex, which ultimately catalyzes full conversion of free Pg to Pm. Protein Purification and Characterization—[Glu]Pg, [Lys]Pg, Pm, and SK were prepared and their concentrations determined as described in the companion paper (16Boxrud P.D. Verhamme I.M. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36633-36641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Gel Electrophoresis—Pg activation reactions were initiated at 25 °C by addition of SK in 50 mm Hepes, 0.125 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4, and inactivated with 100 μm (d-Phe)-Phe-Arg-CH2Cl for 2 min at room temperature before preparation of gel samples and electrophoresis on SDS 4–15% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with Sypro Orange (Molecular Probes) and protein bands visualized with a 300-nm transilluminator. Plasminogen Activation Kinetics—Activation of Pg by SK was measured by continuous monitoring of the increase in absorbance of d-Val-Leu-Lys-pNA (VLK-pNA) at 405 nm (ΔA405 nm). The parabolic progress curves of pNA formation were fit by Equation 1 (30Wohl R.C. Summaria L. Arzadon L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1402-1407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Wohl R.C. Summaria L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2005-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to obtain the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis at the beginning of the reaction (v1) and the rate of increase in activity with time (v2).ΔA405 nm=v2t22+v1t(Eq. 1) Linear transformation of the time courses was done by dividing ΔA405 nm by t (20Kosow D.P. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4459-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Michaelis-Menten parameters for SK·Pm-catalyzed activation of [Glu]Pg and [Lys]Pg were determined from the hyperbolic dependences of v2 rates on the total Pg concentration at 0.1 nm SK and 0.5 nm Pm. Because of the very low dissociation constant (12 pm), this corresponded to 0.1 nm SK·Pm complex. Free Pm and SK·Pm contributed to v1, but Pm alone did not activate Pg (15Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31Wohl R.C. Summaria L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2005-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Discontinuous Plasmin Assay—Discontinuous assays of the initial rates of Pm generation in reactions of Pg and SK were performed by incubation of SK and [Lys]Pg1 for various times and quenching the reaction by addition of 1 μm FFR-Pm and 10 mm 6-AHA to dissociate the SK·Pg* complex and to inhibit additional formation of Pm. Following 2 min of incubation, chromogenic substrate assays of quenched samples were initiated by addition of 50 μm VLK-pNA, and the concentrations of Pm were calculated from slopes of the linear rates. The substrate concentration was chosen such that free Pm and SK-bound Pm had equal contributions to the rate, independent of SK concentration (15Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Discontinuous assays of Pm generation were linear with time at up to 60% Pg depletion, and data were fit by linear least squares to determine the rates. Pre-quenched reactions in which 6-AHA and FFR-Pm were present in the incubation resulted in rates of essentially zero. The activities of quenched reactions were stable with time, exhibiting <0.5% increase in activity over 20 min after quenching. The assay yielded the Pm concentration accurately in mixtures of Pg or SK containing known levels of Pm. Kinetic Model of Plasminogen Activation by Streptokinase—The dependences of v1 and v2 on SK concentration can be described by the mechanism in Schemes 1 and 2. In Scheme 1, SK binds to Pg with dissociation constant KA to form the conformationally activated SK·Pg* complex, which catalyzes chromogenic substrate (S) hydrolysis with Michaelis-Menten parameters Km and kc. Binding of Pg as a substrate of SK·Pg* with dissociation constant KS forms the ternary Michaelis complex (SK·Pg*·Pg) that generates Pm with the catalytic rate constant k0. As illustrated in Scheme 2, the SK·Pm complex can also catalyze Pg activation to Pm, and SK·Pm hydrolyzes the chromogenic substrate with Michaelis constants K″m and k″c. The extremely high affinity of SK for Pm (K′A 12 pm) compared with [Glu]Pg and [Lys]Pg is assumed to result in SK·Pm as the product. Under initial conditions where [SK]0 > [Pg]0, all of the Pm generated is present as SK·Pm, whereas at [SK]0 < [Pg]0, all SK becomes complexed with Pm as the reaction progresses. With the assumption that Pg activation by SK·Pm (Scheme 2) does not contribute significantly to the initial rate, and only modestly in reactions with [Lys]Pg at [SK]0 < [Pg]0, the observed progress of activity formation is given by Equation 1, where v1 is described by the equations in the companion paper (16Boxrud P.D. Verhamme I.M. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36633-36641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the initial rate of Pm generation by the SK·Pg* complex (v2) is given by Equation 2,v2=ko(SK·Pg*·Pg)(Eq. 2) Dividing v2 by [SK]0 in terms of [Pg]free gave Equation 3,v2[SK]0=k0[Pg]freeKS(1+[S]0Km+KA[Pg]free)+[Pg]free(Eq. 3) where [Pg]free is given by the cubic equation described previously (16Boxrud P.D.

The v2 dependences were obtained from activation progress curves as a function of SK and Pg concentrations analyzed by fitting the simplified Equation 4 and the quadratic binding equation.Scheme 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As will be shown, the concentrations of Pg were also much lower than K′S for activation of Pg as a substrate of the SK·Pm complex, indicating that the proteolytic reaction in Scheme 2 could also be represented as bimolecular, with rate constant kI,m. With the above assumptions for both proteolytic reactions in Schemes 1 and 2, Reactions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 were simulated by numerical integration of the differential rate equations using Kinetics (ARSoftware).REACTION 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)REACTION 3View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)REACTION 4View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)REACTION 5View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)REACTION 6View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In this model, Pm produced by the SK·Pg* complex with bimolecular rate constant kPg is identified as PmA, whereas Pm formed by the SK·Pm complex with rate constant kPm is PmB. The binding steps (Reactions 1, 3, and 5) were assumed to be rapidly established relative to the irreversible bimolecular proteolytic Reactions 2, 4, and 6. Diffusion-controlled values of k1 and k2 of 1 × 108m–1 s–1 were used, and the reverse rate constants were assigned appropriate values to give the desired dissociation constants, where k–1/k1 = KA in Equation 4. Pm formed by both routes was assumed to have the same affinity for SK and to catalyze Pg activation with the same bimolecular rate constant (kPm). The total concentration of Pm ([Pm]T) was calculated as [Pm]T = [Pm]A + [Pm]B + [SK·Pm]A + [SK·Pm]B. Similarly, [Pg]T = [Pg] + [SK·Pg*]. Time courses of the reactions were simulated with parameters and initial concentrations given in the text. Assignment of v2 to the Rate of Pm Formation—As shown previously, continuous assays of Pg activation were parabolic, with the initial rate (v1) representing substrate turnover by the conformationally activated SK·Pg* complex, followed by an increase in rate (v2) thought to represent proteolytic Pm formation (16Boxrud P.D. Verhamme I.M. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36633-36641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A discontinuous assay specific for Pm was developed to verify that v2 could be assigned to the rate of Pm formation. The assay was specific for Pm and was not affected by the presence of Pg or SK·Pg* as demonstrated by control experiments. Fig. 1A shows a comparison of Pm formation from a reaction of 10 nm [Lys]Pg1 and 50 nm SK determined by the discontinuous and continuous methods. Pm formation as measured by the discontinuous Pm assay was linear for up to 500 s with a slope of 0.0072 ± 0.0003 nm Pm s–1. The initial Pm concentration was essentially zero (<1% of total Pg), and no lags or bursts in Pm formation were observed, indicating the absence of kinetically controlling intermediates of Pm generating reactions. The v2 values from continuous assays of reactions of 10 nm [Lys]Pg1 and 50 nm SK collected as a function of fixed levels of 50–400 μm VLK-pNA, when transformed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” were linear with slopes equal to v2. The dependence of v2 on chromogenic substrate concentration was consistent with hyperbolic inhibition of Pm formation with an apparent inhibition constant of 330 ± 80 μm. When the progress curves were corrected for inhibition by substrate, the average slope of Pm formation was 0.0059 ± 0.0002 nm Pm s–1, in good agreement with the rate measured by the discontinuous assay. Rates of Pm generation determined by the discontinuous and continuous assays in the presence of 200 μm VLK-pNA for activation of 10 nm [Lys]Pg1 by SK showed excellent agreement over a wide SK concentration range (Fig. 1B). The results demonstrated indistinguishable rates of Pm formation from the Pg activation reactions measured by the continuous and discontinuous assays. Inhibition of Pm Formation by Excess SK—To characterize further the correspondence between v2 and Pm formation and inhibition of the reaction by excess SK, the products of reactions of Pg and SK were examined by SDS-gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 2A, reactions of 0.5 μm [Lys]Pg1 with 0.1–5 μm SK incubated for 4 min showed an increase in Pm formation up to 0.25 μm SK, followed by inhibition at higher SK concentrations, as evidenced by an increase in residual Pg and a decrease in intensity of the Pm heavy and light chains. Results of activation of 0.5 μm [Glu]Pg1 for 10 min with 0.1–5 μm SK gave similar results (Fig. 2B), except that inhibition of Pm formation required higher SK concentrations compared with [Lys]Pg. Specific cleavage of SK to form the SK degradation product SK′ (where SK′ is the two-fragment complex generated by cleavage of streptokinase at Lys59) (32Brockway W.J. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2063-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) at low SK concentration and nonspecific degradation at high SK concentrations were consistent with previous results (15Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated clearly that v2 represented the rate of proteolytic Pm formation, which was inhibited by high SK concentrations. Analysis of the Kinetics of SK-induced Pm Generation—Previous kinetic studies of Pg activation by SK suggested that Pm was initially formed either by intramolecular cleavage of Pg within the SK·Pg* complex (20Kosow D.P. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4459-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 21Bajaj A.P. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 492-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Summaria L.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3585-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether the intermolecular model of Pg activation (Scheme 1), without consideration of SK·Pm-catalyzed Pg activation (Scheme 2), fitted the observed kinetics, SK kinetic titrations of several fixed concentrations of Pg were performed and analyzed according to the simplified two-step form of this model shown by the upper reactions in Schema 3 (Fig. 3). In this scheme, SK binds to Pg with the dissociation constant KA, forming the conformationally activated SK·Pg* complex, which subsequently binds and cleaves Pg to Pm with bimolecular rate constant kPg. Results in the companion paper (16Boxrud P.D. Verhamme I.M. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36633-36641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) demonstrated that representation of the formation of SK·Pg* as a single binding and activation equilibrium, and the SK·Pg*-catalyzed proteolytic reaction as bimolecular were justified. v2 values from continuous assays of reactions of 2–20 nm [Lys]Pg1 with varying SK (Fig. 3A) were fit by Equation 4 and the quadratic binding equation derived for Scheme 3 with the assumptions that [Pg]free « KS and [S]0 « Km, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Analysis of the dependence of v1 on SK concentration gave a good fit to the data with 12 ± 3 nm for KA (16Boxrud P.D. Verhamme I.M. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36633-36641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Simultaneous analysis of the v2 data resulted in a value of 2.3 ± 0.2 nm for KA, which was ∼5-fold lower than the value obtained from the v1 data and kPg of 0.79 ± 0.02 μm–1 s–1 (Fig. 3A). Comparable values were obtained for reactions of 5–20 nm [Lys]Pg2 with SK (Table I).Fig. 3Kinetics of [Lys]Pg and [Glu]Pg activation by SK.

Oxalobacter formigenes is a Gram-negative, obligate anaerobe (1Allison M.J. Dawson K.A. Mayberry W.R. Foss J.G. Arch.

Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3011-3013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This microorganism, which colonizes the gastrointestinal tract of humans and other mammals, is of biological interest for two reasons. First, recent work has demonstrated an intriguing correlation between the absence of O. formigenes in humans and kidney stone formation because of elevated levels of oxalate in the blood (4Sidhu H.

Gallagher S. Clayman R.V. J. Nutr. 1986; 116: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), an observation that has led to the somewhat controversial hypothesis that O. formigenes plays a key role in mediating mammalian oxalate homeostasis (6Sidhu H. Schmidt M.E. Cornelius J.E. Thamilsevan S. Khan S.R. Hesse A. Peck A.B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 14: S334-S340Google Scholar). Second, ATP production appears to depend solely on the anaerobic conversion of oxalate to formate and CO2 (7Anatharam V. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7244-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Carbohydrates cannot be used to replace oxalate as a growth substrate, perhaps implying that this organism lacks a functional glycolytic pathway (8Cornick N.A. Allison M.J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1996; 42: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).As reported for other bacteria (9Quayle J.R. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Jakoby W.B. Ohmura E. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 435-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zaitsev G.M. Govorukhina N.I. Laskovneva O.V. Trotsenko Y.A. Microbiology. 1993; 62: 378-382Google Scholar), cleavage of the oxalate C–C bond in O. formigenes is accomplished by the action of a thiamin-dependent, oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase (12Baetz A.L. Allison M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2605-2608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) encoded by the oxc gene (13Lung H.-Y. Baetz A.L. Peck A.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2468-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). ATP-dependent formation of oxalyl-CoA is avoided by coupling decarboxylation to an acyl transfer reaction in which formyl-CoA 1 and oxalate 2 are converted to oxalyl-CoA 3 and formate 4 by formyl-CoA transferase (FRC) 1The abbreviations used are: FRC, formyl-CoA transferase; WT, wild type; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: FRC, formyl-CoA transferase; WT, wild type; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. (14Baetz A.L. Allison M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3537-3540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The overall catalytic cycle therefore transforms oxalate into formate and CO2 (Fig. 1). The metabolic importance of this coupled enzyme system in O. formigenes is suggested by the fact that oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase and FRC constitute ∼20% of the total protein content in this microorganism (15Baetz A.L. Allison M.J. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 15: 167-171Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In contrast to aerobic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas oxalaticus (16Quayle J.R. Keech D.B. Biochem. J. 1959; 72: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which employ formate dehydrogenase to oxidize formate to CO2 with concomitant production of NADH (17Jormakka M. Tornroth S. Byrne B. Iwata S. Science. 2002; 295: 1863-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), O. formigenes uses a membrane-bound, formate:oxalate antiporter (18Hirai T. Heymann J.A.W. Shi D. Sarker R.

Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (5973) Google Scholar) reveals the existence of open reading frames encoding proteins that are homologous to both FRC and oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase. This is an intriguing observation given that the ability of this microorganism to metabolize oxalate has not been reported.There are several aspects of FRC that are of considerable biochemical and mechanistic interest. First, primary sequence analysis has placed FRC within a new family (Class III) of CoA-transferases (23Heider J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which also includes enzymes that are involved in the anaerobic metabolism of carnitine (24Elssner T. Engemann C. Baumgart K.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 17-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of these enzymes have similar masses and are active as homo- or heterodimers (23Heider J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism employed by the Class III CoA-transferases has yet not been experimentally defined, although it has been the subject of considerable speculation (23Heider J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 29Ricagno S. Jonsson S. Richards N. Lindqvist Y.

Chem. 2003; 278: 34582-34586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our recent x-ray crystallographic studies have shown that FRC exists as an interlocked dimer (Fig. 2A) (29Ricagno S. Jonsson S. Richards N. Lindqvist Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3210-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), raising significant questions concerning the folding pathways that might lead to such a structure. In this regard, we note that the protein encoded by the YfdW gene in E. coli, which is clearly homologous to FRC, has been shown independently to possess an identical interlocked structure (30Gruez A. Roig-Zamboni V. Valencia C. Campanacci V. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34582-34586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 31Gagos A. Gorman J. Shapiro L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The ability of the YfdW gene product to catalyze coenzyme A transfer, however, has not yet been reported.Fig. 2Crystal structure of the interlocked FRC dimer complexed to Co-A.A, for clarity, the protein monomers are colored red and green and represented by molecular ribbons.

Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1688-1699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further evidence for this mechanistic proposal is provided by the x-ray crystallographic observation of an acylenzyme intermediate that is formed when FRC is incubated with oxalyl-CoA. These studies therefore establish the catalytic mechanism of FRC, which is almost certainly employed by all other members of the Class III CoA-transferase family.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All of the materials were of the highest purity available and, unless stated otherwise, were obtained from Fisher or Sigma-Aldrich. Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method (33Lowry O.H. Rosebrough S.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) based on a standard curve constructed using known amounts of bovine serum albumin. DNA sequencing was performed by the DNA Sequencing Core of the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research at the University of Florida. The BL21(DE3) E. coli expression strain transformed with pET-9a plasmid carrying the gene for WT FRC was supplied by Dr. Harmeet Sidhu (Ixion Biotechnology, Inc., Alachua, FL). PCR primers were obtained from either GenoMechanix LLC (Gainesville, FL) (D169A and D169E) or Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA) (D169S).FRC Expression and Purification—WT formyl CoA transferase (WT FRC) from O. formigenes was overexpressed in E. coli using literature procedures (34Sidhu H. Ogden S.D. Lung H.-Y. Luttge B.G. Baetz A.L. Peck A.B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3378-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and purified using anion exchange and affinity chromatography. Hence, the lysate supernatant from 4–6 liters of culture was loaded on a 120-ml DEAE Fast Flow column equilibrated with buffer A (25 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.2), and FRC was obtained by stepping to a concentration of 35% buffer B (25 mm sodium phosphate, 1.0 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.2). Fractions containing FRC were then loaded on a 20-ml Blue-FF affinity column equilibrated with buffer A, and the column was washed with 1:1 buffer A/buffer B. Recombinant FRC was then obtained by eluting with buffer C (25 mm glycine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% isopropanol, pH 9.0). After buffer exchange by passage through a 135-ml G-25 desalting column, equilibrated with buffer A, the solution containing FRC was injected on a 60-ml Q-Sepharose HP column equilibrated with buffer A. Purified FRC was then obtained by stepping to 20% buffer B followed by a linear increase in buffer B to a final concentration of 35%, with the desired enzyme eluting near the middle of this gradient. Glycerol was added to the combined FRC-containing fractions to a final concentration of 10%, given that the purified protein has a tendency to precipitate. The purity at each chromatographic step was verified by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. The flow rates used in these experiments were 5, 4, 10, and 5 ml/min for the DEAE, Blue-FF, G-25, and Q-Sepharose columns, respectively.Expression and Purification of the D169A, D169E, and D169S FRC Mutants—Mutagenic primers were designed using Gene Runner version 3.05 (Hastings Software). The pET-9a plasmid containing the WT FRC sequence was purified using the Wizard Plus Minipreps® DNA purification system (Promega) and used as a template for PCR with mutagenetic primers using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The desired point mutations were verified by DNA sequencing of the inserts in the resulting pET-9a plasmids isolated from transformed XL-1 or XL-10 Gold supercompetent cells (Stratagene). Subsequent transformation of BL21(DE3) competent cells (Novagen) permitted overexpression and purification of the D169A, D169E, and D169S FRC mutants as described for recombinant, WT FRC.Synthesis of Formyl-CoA and Oxalyl-CoA—Formyl-CoA of very high purity was prepared by modification of literature procedures (35Sly W.S.

Thus, formic acid (5.8 ml, 150 mmol) was added dropwise to acetic anhydride (7.1 ml, 75 mmol), and the resulting mixture was heated at 45 °C for 2.5 h to give a solution of the mixed anhydride (formylating reagent) (37Stevens W. Vanes A. Recl. Trav. Chim. 1964; 83: 863-872Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After cooling to room temperature, pyridine (61 μl, 0.75 mmol) was added to the solution immediately followed by thiophenol (5.1 ml, 50 mmol), and the resulting mixture stirred at room temperature for 24 h. Unreacted anhydrides, formic acid, and acetic acid were then removed by distillation under reduced pressure (20 mm Hg) at 50 °C, until the total volume was ∼6 ml. This oily material was then washed with cold, deionized water, and the organic layer was dried (MgSO4). The desired formyl thioester 5 was then obtained by vacuum distillation as a clear oil: 3.1 g, 45%; boiling point 115–117 °C, 23 mm Hg (literature valve 101 °C, 15 mm Hg (36Bax P.C. Stevens W. Recl. Trav. Chim. 1970; 89: 265-269Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar)). This material was then reacted with the sodium salt of coenzyme A using literature protocols to give formyl-CoA 1 (35Sly W.S.

Formyl-CoA 1 and oxalyl-CoA 3 were further purified by reverse-phase HPLC on a preparative C18 column (Dynamax 60A C18, 250 × 21.4 mm). In our standard procedure, the column was equilibrated with 90% mobile phase A (10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 4.5) and 10% mobile phase B (phase A containing 20% CH3CN) running at 8 ml/min. After injection of each sample, the amount of B was increased to 40% using a linear gradient over 20 min. The absorbance of the eluent was monitored at 260 nm, and fractions containing the pure CoA derivative were combined and lyophilized to give the desired compounds as white solids, which could be stored at -80 °C without significant amounts of decomposition.Enzymatic Assay—Wild type, recombinant FRC was assayed by measuring the initial rate of oxalyl-CoA formation. The assay mixture contained 60 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.7, FRC (90 ng), appropriate concentrations of substrates (formyl-CoA and oxalate), and, in the case of the product inhibition experiments, oxalyl-CoA or formate (total volume, 200 μl). The reaction was started by the addition of formyl-CoA after incubating the other components at 30 °C for about 30 s. Aliquots of the reaction mixture (90 μl) were typically taken after 60 and 90 s and quenched with 10% AcOH (10 μl) before being analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC using a modification of previous procedures for analyzing CoA derivatives (39Demoz A. Garras A. Asiedu D.K. Netteland B. Berge R.K. J. Chromatogr. B. 1995; 667: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, aliquots (75 μl) of the quenched reaction mixture were injected onto a C18 analytical column (Dynamax Microsorb 60–8 C18, 250 × 4.6 mm) that had been equilibrated using 86% buffer A (25 mm NaOAc, pH 4.5) and 14% buffer B (buffer A containing 20% CH3CN) running at 1.0 ml/min. Immediately after injection the proportion of buffer B was increased to 30% over a 210-s time period, followed by a step to 100% buffer B that was continued for 90 s before re-equilibrating with 86:14 buffer A:buffer B. The eluant was monitored at 260 nm. Under these conditions, oxalate eluted close to the void volume of the column (2.6 min), oxalyl-CoA eluted after 6.3 min, and free CoA and formyl-CoA eluted last from the column (9.0 min). The amount of oxalyl-CoA in the aliquots was determined by integration of the oxalyl-CoA peaks in the HPLC chromatograms and comparison with known amounts of authentic material. These measurements were calibrated using independent determinations of formyl-CoA concentration using a hydroxylamine-based colorimetric assay (35Sly W.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2632-2638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and oxalate concentration in hydrolyzed and nonhydrolyzed samples of oxalyl-CoA with a standard detection kit (Sigma). No formation of oxalyl-CoA was detected in control experiments when the enzyme or either substrate was omitted or boiled enzyme was used. The limit of detection of this HPLC-based assay is 0.05 μm of oxalyl-CoA when 75-μl aliquots are injected onto the column.The specific activities of the D169A, D169E, and D169S FRC mutants were assayed using an identical procedure except that reaction mixtures were incubated for up to 60 min prior to quenching with AcOH. In addition, given the much lower activity of the FRC mutants, the amount of protein in each assay was increased to 2 μg, and the initial concentrations of oxalate and formyl-CoA were 100 mm and 200 μm, respectively.Analysis of Kinetic Data—Steady state kinetic constants (Km and Vmax) were determined by fitting the data from the initial rate studies using weighted hyperbolic regression analysis (Hyper, version 1.1). Data analysis was performed using standard equations (40Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley-Interscience, New York.1975: 273-329Google Scholar).Determination of the Equilibrium Constant for FRC-catalyzed CoA Transfer—The equilibrium constant for the FRC-catalyzed reaction was determined by incubating the recombinant, WT enzyme (18 μg) with 73 μm formyl-CoA, 50 μm potassium oxalate in 60 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.7 (total volume, 200 μl). The solution also contained 13 μm formate and 13 μm free CoA, present in the initial sample of formyl-CoA used in the experiment. This mixture was then incubated at 22 °C for 90 min. During this time, aliquots (45 μl) were withdrawn after 10, 27, and 52 min and quenched with 10% AcOH (5 μl). The concentration of oxalyl-CoA, free CoA (and therefore formate), and formyl-CoA in each sample was measured by reverse-phase HPLC as described above. Under these conditions, equilibrium was achieved after 27 min, giving Keq = 32 ± 3.Size Exclusion Chromatography Measurements—A BIOSEP SEC-S2000 column (300 × 7.8 mm with 75 × 7.8-mm guard column) was calibrated using lysozyme (14.4 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29.0 kDa), peroxidase (44.0 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.0 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), and β-amylase (200 kDa). The void volume was measured by injecting blue dextran. A sample of recombinant, WT O. formigenes FRC (72 μg) was prepared by filtration through a 50-kDa cut-off spin column, and the retentate resuspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.6 (total volume, 75 μl). An aliquot of this solution was then injected onto the BIOSEP SEC-S2000 column, giving a single peak with a retention time corresponding to a molecular mass of 81 kDa.Crystallization and Structure Determination of the D169A, D169E, and D169S FRC Mutants—All three Asp169 mutants were dialyzed and subsequently crystallized as their complexes with coenzyme A using identical conditions to those described previously for WT FRC (41Ricagno S.

Diffraction data for the Ala and Glu mutants were collected at beam line X11 (Deutsches Electronen Synchrotron, Hamburg, Germany) equipped with a Mar research 165-mm CCD detector; diffraction data for the Ser mutant were collected at I711 (MaxLab) equipped with a Mar research 165-mm CCD detector.

The crystals of the three mutants all belonged to space group I4 with the following unit cell parameters: D169E: a = b = 150.0 Å, c = 99.6 Å; D169A: a = b = 150.0 Å, c = 99.6 Å; D169S: a = b = 151.8 Å, c = 100.2 Å.

Silicone oil was added to the crystallization drop as cryoprotectant, and crystals were flash frozen. Diffraction data were collected at 110 K at beamline I711 (MaxLab) on fresh crystals (11 days) to minimize uncatalyzed hydrolysis of oxalyl-CoA.

https://openalex.org/W2089495500,"d-Glyceraldehyde (d-GLYC) is usually considered to be a stimulator of insulin secretion but theoretically can also form reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can inhibit beta cell function. We examined the time- and concentration-dependent effects of d-GLYC on insulin secretion, insulin content, and formation of ROS. We observed that a 2-h exposure to 0.05–2 mmd-GLYC potentiated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in isolated Wistar rat islets but that higher concentrations inhibited GSIS. A 24-h exposure to 2 mmd-GLYC inhibited GSIS, decreased insulin content, and increased intracellular peroxide levels (2.14 ± 0.31-fold increase, n = 4, p < 0.05). N-Acetylcysteine (10 mm) prevented the increase in intracellular peroxides and the adverse effects of d-GLYC on GSIS. In the presence of 11.1 but not 3.0 mm glucose, koningic acid (10 μm), a specific glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor, increased intracellular peroxide levels (1.88 ± 0.30-fold increase, n = 9, p < 0.01) and inhibited GSIS (control GSIS = p < 0.001; koningic acid GSIS, not significant). To determine whether oxidative phosphorylation was the source of ROS formation, we cultured rat islets with mitochondrial inhibitors. Neither rotenone or myxothiazol prevented d-GLYC-induced increases in islet ROS. Adenoviral overexpression of manganese superoxide dismutase also failed to prevent the effect of d-GLYC to increase ROS levels. These observations indicate that exposure to excess d-GLYC increases reactive oxygen species in the islet via non-mitochondrial pathways and suggest the hypothesis that the oxidative stress associated with elevated d-GLYC levels could be a mechanism for glucose toxicity in beta cells exposed chronically to high glucose concentrations. d-Glyceraldehyde (d-GLYC) is usually considered to be a stimulator of insulin secretion but theoretically can also form reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can inhibit beta cell function.

However, hydroxyaldehydes such as glyceraldehyde can also undergo enolization in the presence of heavy metals to produce an enediol radical anion, which in the presence of oxygen generates superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals (9Wolff S.P.

In this work we designed experiments to ascertain 1) the time- and concentration-dependent effects of d-GLYC on intraislet peroxide levels, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), and intraislet insulin content; 2) whether N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a potent antioxidant, prevents d-GLYC from forming ROS and inhibiting GSIS; and 3) whether the mitochondrial electron transport chain mediates ROS production by d-GLYC and thereby causes adverse effects on beta cell function. Materials—d-GLYC, NAC, rotenone, thenoyltrifluoroacetone, myxothiazol, and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone were obtained from Sigma. Koningic acid, a specific glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) inhibitor, was a gift from Dr Keiji Hasumi (Tokyo Noko University, Tokyo, Japan). Pancreatic Islet Isolation—Pancreata from male Wistar rats were infused with 10 ml of a 1.5 mg/ml collagenase type XI (Sigma)/1% fetal bovine serum/2 units/ml RQ1 DNase (Promega) solution in Medium 199 (Sigma). After surgical excision, the pancreas was incubated in the collagenase solution at 37 °C. Undigested tissue was removed by using a 500-μm screen, and the recovered tissue was washed twice with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin followed by centrifugation at 250 × g for 4 min. Islets in the pellet were separated by using a Histopaque-1077 gradient (Sigma) and then hand-picked and cultured in RPMI medium 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 11.1 mm glucose, and penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B before experimentation. Manganese Superoxide Dismutase Adenovirus Infection—Adenovirus encoding manganese superoxide dismutase, the mitochondrial form of the antioxidant enzyme, was the generous gift from the University of Iowa Adenoviral Facility (Iowa City, IA). Isolated islets were cultured in the presence of adenovirus (at a final concentration of 107 plaque-forming unit/islet) in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h at 37 °C. After 24 h the islets were transferred into fresh RPMI media containing 10% fetal bovine serum with or without d-GLYC for another 24 h prior to study. Insulin Content and Secretion Studies—Static incubation of islets in Krebs-Ringer buffer containing either non-stimulatory or stimulatory concentrations of glucose was performed for 1 h. Insulin levels in the Krebs-Ringer buffer samples collected from the static incubations or from insulin content samples extracted from the islets by using 95:5 ethanol:hydrochloric acid solution were measured by using a sensitive rat insulin radioimmunoassay kit (Linco Research Immunoassay, St. Charles, MO). Measurement of Insulin and β-Actin mRNAs—One-step reverse transcription-PCR was carried out by using Gold reverse transcription-PCR kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector equipped with a thermocycler (TaqMan Technology) and a cooled charged-coupled device camera to detect fluorescence emission over a range of wavelengths (500–650 nm) as described previously (8Tanaka Y.

Evaluation of ROS and Cell Viability with Flow Cytometry—Intra-cellular peroxide levels were detected by flow cytometric analysis using an oxidation-sensitive fluorescein-labeled dye, carboxylated dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (carboxy-H2DCFDA, Molecular Probes, Ref. 8Tanaka Y. Tran P.O. Harmon J. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12363-12368Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The carboxy-acetoxymethyl ester derivative facilitates diffusion across the cell membranes, and upon cleavage of the acetate groups by endogenous esterase activity, the leakage of the dye is impeded by the two additional negative charges. Upon oxidation by intracellular ROS, the non-fluorescent dye is converted to its fluorescent form. Islets were labeled with 100 μm carboxy-H2DCFDA for 1 h at 37 °C. Following the cell loading of the dye, the islets were washed twice with PBS and then put back into culture conditions for 2 h. Islets were then harvested, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in trypsin-EDTA (0.25% trypsin, 1 mm Na4-EDTA, Invitrogen) for 5 min at 37 °C. To disperse the islets into a single cell suspension, islets were gently passed 20 times in and out of a 200–1000-μl tip. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The pellet was then resuspended in ice-cold PBS, and 2 μg/ml propidium iodide was added. Cells were analyzed using a 488 nm argon laser EPICS XL-MCL flow cytometer controlled by EXPO 32-ADC software (Beckman Coulter). A single cell population gate was created using a biparametric plot of forward scatter and side scatter to exclude groups of more then one cell and debris. A live cell gate was then created using a biparametric plot of side scatter and propidium iodide (log fluorescence) of the single cell population. ROS values were analyzed using a histogram plot of carboxy-H2DCFDA (log fluorescence). Results were calculated as the -fold difference from control untreated cells. Cell viability was calculated as the number of propidium iodide-negative cells within the single cell population of 10,000 total ungated events. Experimental conditions are expressed as the percentage of viable cells compared with control conditions. Measurement of ATP Content—Rat islets (100 islets/each condition) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 50 μl of cell lysis buffer (Promega). ATP levels were determined by using a luciferase-based assay (ATP determination kit, Molecular Probes), according to Molecular Probes' directions. Luminescence was read by FUSION (Packard). Measurement of GAPDH Activity—GAPDH activity was measured by monitoring the conversion of NADH to NAD+ at 340 nm (21Sakai K. Hasumi K. Endo A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Islets were sonicated in homogenization buffer containing 100 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. After a brief centrifugation to collect cell debris, the supernatant was collected and assayed for GAPDH activity. Supernatant was added to reaction buffer containing 79.1 mm triethanolamine, 6 mm glycerate 3-phosphate, 1.6 mm MgSO4, 0.9 mm EDTA, 1.1 mm ATP, and 3 units of phosphoglycerate kinase and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min before the addition of 0.2 mm NADH. Spectrophotometric measurements were made at 340 nm every 30 s for 3 min. Statistics—Comparisons between the results of the experiments were performed using either unpaired or paired analyses and analysis of variance or Student's t test where appropriate. p < 0.05 was considered significant. d-Glyceraldehyde Effects on Insulin Secretion and Insulin Content in Rat Islets—Over a 2-h period, 0.05–2 mmd-GLYC-augmented glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin content (Fig. 1, A and C). However, at concentrations higher than 2 mm, d-GLYC decreased GSIS in a concentration-dependent manner. In 24-h incubations, concentrations of 1–2 mmd-GLYC decreased GSIS (Fig. 1B) and insulin content (Fig. 1C). These adverse effects were even more evident when higher concentrations of d-GLYC were used for 24 h. d-Glyceraldehyde Effects on Intracellular Peroxide Levels— Exposure of rat islets to exogenous d-GLYC, 2 mm, for 2–8 h had no effect on intracellular ROS levels, but 16- and 24-h exposure increased intracellular ROS 2.05 ± 0.36-fold (16 h) and 2.14 ± 0.31-fold (24 h) (Fig. 2, both n = 4, p < 0.05). Islets were exposed to 10 μm koningic acid (KA) to increase endogenous d-GLYC levels. KA in the presence of either 3.0 or 16.7 mm glucose for 72 h decreased GAPDH activity to virtually zero (Table I). In the presence of 11.1 but not 3.0 mm glucose, KA increased intracellular ROS to a level (1.88 ± 0.30-fold increase, Fig. 3A) that was not statistically different from that observed with 2 mmd-GLYC. KA completely inhibited GSIS (Fig. 3B).Table IThe effect of KA, a specific GAPDH inhibitor, on GAPDH activity in isolated islets in the presence of 3.0 or 17.7 mm glucose for 72 hGlucoseKoningic acidGAPDH activitymmμm-fold control3.001.00aSignificantly different, p < 0.001.3.0100.09 ± 0.04aSignificantly different, p < 0.001.16.701.56 ± 0.18bSignificantly different, p < 0.001.16.7100.09 ± 0.05bSignificantly different, p < 0.001.a Significantly different, p < 0.001.b Significantly different, p < 0.001.

NAC prevented a d-GLYC-induced increase of intracellular ROS levels after 16- and 24-h culture (Fig. 2) and prevented the adverse effects on GSIS (Fig. 4A). NAC did not prevent d-GLYC from decreasing insulin content (Fig. 4B). d-GLYC caused an increase in insulin mRNA levels (Fig. 4C), an effect attenuated but not blocked by NAC. Effects of Mitochondrial Electronic Transport Chain Inhibitors on ATP and Cell Viability in Rat Islets—Islets were cultured for 24 h with various concentrations of rotenone, an inhibitor of complex I, thenoyltrifluoroacetone, an inhibitor of complex II, myxothiazol, an inhibitor of complex III, and carbonyl cyanide m-chloropheneylhydrazone, an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation. Concentrations were sought that decreased islet ATP content >10% with <10% cytotoxicity. Rotenone (150 nm) and myxothiazol (3 ng/ml) were found to decrease ATP content by 62 and 26%, respectively, with <10% cytotoxicity (Fig. 5 and Table II). Thenoyltrifluoroacetone and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone did not decrease ATP content without causing >10% cytotoxicity.Table IISummary of the effects of oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors on islet killing and ATP content (seeFig. 5)Cell viabilityMaximum non-toxic (drug)ATP content%%Rotenone>90300 nm38 (150 nm)TTFAaTTFA, thenoyltrifluoroacetone.>90400 μm98Myxothiazol>903 ng/ml74CCCPbCCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone.>901.5 mm92a TTFA, thenoyltrifluoroacetone.b CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. Open table in a new tab Effects of Mitochondrial Electronic Transport Chain Inhibitors and Manganese Superoxide Dismutase Overexpression ond-Glyceraldehyde-induced ROS Generation—Neither rotenone (150 nm) nor myxothiazol (3 ng/ml) prevented the stimulatory effects of d-GLYC on intracellular ROS levels (Fig. 6). Adenoviral overexpression of manganase superoxide dismutase, the mitochondrial form of the antioxidant enzyme, increased islet manganese superoxide dismutase protein but failed to prevent the stimulatory effect of d-GLYC on ROS formation (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Effects of adenoviral over-expression of manganese superoxide dismutase overexpression on d-GLYC-induced ROS formation in rat islets. Isolated islets were cultured in the presence of adenovirus (at a final concentration of 107 plaque-forming units/islet) in RPMI medium supplemented for 24 h. After 24 h the islets were transferred into fresh RPMI media with or without d-GLYC for another 24 h prior to study. d-GLYC increased ROS levels of uninfected islets and control adenovirus-infected islets (Ad). Overexpression of manganese superoxide dismutase did not prevent these effects. (*, p < 0.01–0.05 versus uninfected). All data are presented as means ± S.E. for three independent experiments with duplicate determinations. Inset, increase of manganese superoxide dismutase levels by Western analysis after infection of islet with adenovirus encoding manganese superoxide dismutase (Ad-MnSOD).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We previously reported that exposure to high glucose concentrations increased intracellular peroxide levels in human islets and that ROS accumulation caused defective beta cell function (8Tanaka Y. Tran P.O. Harmon J. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12363-12368Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This effect was prevented by coincubation with a glucokinase inhibitor, mannoheptulose, indicating that glucose metabolism is essential for generation of ROS in islets. The current studies were designed to examine the hypothesis that the accumulation of excess intracellular concentrations of d-GLYC during the exposure of islets to supraphysiologic concentrations of glucose might contribute to beta cell glucotoxicity via ROS formation. We observed that d-GLYC has time-and concentration-dependent biphasic effects on GSIS and insulin content and that it increases the intracellular oxidant load of the islet. Koningic acid, a GAPDH inhibitor (21Sakai K. Hasumi K. Endo A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Sakai K. Hasumi K. Endo A. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 2003; 1637: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) used to increase endogenous d-GLYC levels, increased the intracellular oxidant load under high but not low glucose conditions to the same extent as 2 mmd-GLYC and inhibited GSIS. The adverse effects of d-GLYC on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion were blocked by the potent antioxidant NAC. However, NAC did not prevent the d-GLYC-induced decline in insulin content. This dichotomy may be related to the stimulatory effect d-GLYC had on insulin mRNA levels, which was only attenuated by NAC. The ROS-generating effect of d-GLYC was not affected by mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibitors or overexpression of manganese superoxide dismutase, which suggests generation of ROS by d-GLYC occurred via non-mitochondrial pathways. The concept of glucose auto-oxidation via enolization and consequent excess generation of ROS in relation to diabetes was proposed as early as 1987 by Wolff and Dean (9Wolff S.P. Dean R.T. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar) who studied this issue using bovine serum albumin. In 1988, Hunt et al. (10Hunt J.V. Dean R.T. Wolff S.P. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) demonstrated that α-hydroxyaldehydes, such as glyceraldehyde, can undergo enolization to produce an enediol radical anion in the presence of heavy metals. In the presence of oxygen, these anions generate superoxide anions that combine to form hydrogen peroxide in a reaction catalyzed by superoxide dismutase. Hydrogen peroxide in turn forms hydroxyl radicals (10Hunt J.V. Dean R.T. Wolff S.P. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Although it has been reported that d-GLYC can generate ROS in bovine serum albumin, to our knowledge it has not previously been demonstrated that d-GLYC generates ROS in islets or other tissues nor is it generally appreciated that d-GLYC can inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. That the antioxidant NAC can prevent these adverse effects suggests that the generation of ROS is one mechanism of action for d-GLYC-induced beta cell dysfunction. Other potential mechanisms include the formation of a Schiff base adduct between d-glyceraldehyde and a protein that regulates insulin exocytosis. Whether 2 mmd-GLYC is a physiologically relevant concentration to examine is an important issue. Taniguchi et al. (17Taniguchi S. Okinaka M. Tanigawa K. Miwa I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) demonstrated that islets exposed to 2.8 and 20 mm glucose accumulated ∼0 and 0.025 pmol/islet d-GLYC, respectively, whereas exposure to 10 mmd-GLYC caused an accumulation of 0.12 pmol/islet d-GLYC. Because we used one-fifth of this concentration of d-GLYC in our experiments, we estimate it caused intraislet levels of ∼0.025 pmol/islet, a concentration similar to that observed using 20 mm glucose (17Taniguchi S. Okinaka M. Tanigawa K. Miwa I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Taniguchi et al. (17Taniguchi S. Okinaka M. Tanigawa K. Miwa I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that d-GLYC did not increase glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and dihydroxyacetone in isolated rat islets. In our work, exposure of rat islets to KA to increase d-GLYC levels caused an increase in intracellular ROS under 11.1 but not 3.0 mm glucose conditions. This increase in ROS was not significantly different from that observed with 2 mmd-GLYC. It has been also reported that long term to exposure to high glucose concentrations decreases GAPDH activity in islets (15Sakai K. Matsumoto K. Nishikawa T. Suefuji M. Nakamaru K. Hirashima Y. Kawashima J. Shirotani T. Ichinose K. Brownlee M. Araki E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), which could lead to excess d-GLYC accumulation. We acknowledge, however, that results from the KA studies are not conclusive, because KA may not be completely specific for GAPDH, and the inhibition of GAPDH may have caused accumulation of dihydroxyacetone, which in turn could cause depletion of cytosolic NAD via the glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle. Pathways other than enolization, such as protein kinase C activation and/or the formation of methylglyoxal, could also mediate d-GLYC-induced oxidative stress during the exposure of islets to chronically high glucose concentrations. For example, Du et al. (24Du X. Matsumura T. Edelstein D. Rossetti L. Zsengeller Z. Szabo C. Brownlee M. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1049-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) reported recently that GAPDH antisense oligonucleotides activated protein kinase C, NF-κB, and advanced glycation end product formation in bovine aortic endothelial cells but only in high (50 mm) glucose concentrations. However, whether our experiments using KA and 11.1 mm glucose and other reported experiments using 50 mm glucose are necessarily relevant to clinical diabetes mellitus remains to be determined. Nishikawa et al. (12Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Yamagishi S. Matsumura T. Kaneda Y. Yorek M.A. Beebe D. Oates P.J. Hammes H.P. Giardino I. Brownlee M. Nature. 2000; 404: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3658) Google Scholar) demonstrated that long time exposure to a high glucose concentration increased ROS production in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells and through the use of mitochondrial inhibitors concluded that ROS was formed via oxidative phosphorylation. This prompted us to ascertain whether d-GLYC generates ROS via oxidative phosphorylation in islets. Because exposure to electron transport chain inhibitors can be toxic for cells, we first performed cell sorting flow cytometry to separate and quantify dead cells. We considered this step essential, because unappreciated cell death confounds efforts to quantify a decrease in ROS levels, i.e. drugs that kill cells cause an artifactual decrease in apparent intracellular ROS levels. We sought drug concentrations that would decrease ATP content >10% with <10% cytotoxicity. Rotenone and myxothiazol decreased ATP content significantly and still allowed >90% cell viability. Neither drug prevented the ability of d-GLYC to increase intraislet ROS levels. Thenoyltrifluoroacetone and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone both failed to decrease ATP content >10% without causing >10% cytotoxicity and therefore could not be used in these islet experiments. As pharmacological inhibitors are not absolutely specific for cellular targets, we also examined adenoviral overexpression of manganese superoxide dismutase. This caused an increase in islet manganese superoxide dismutase content but failed to prevent d-GLYC-induced production of ROS. These results strongly suggest that d-GLYC generates ROS via non-mitochondrial pathways. Recently, Krauss et al. (25Krauss S. Zhang C.Y. Scorrano L. Dalgaard L.T. St-Pierre J. Grey S.T. Lowell B.B. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1831-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) reported that a high glucose concentration (25 mm) increased mitochondrial superoxide production in islets from wild type and UCP-2 knock-out mice. This led to proton leak, lowered ATP levels, and impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion in islets from the wild type but not from the knock-out animals. Our work suggested that the accumulation of excess endogenous d-glyceraldehyde during exposure to high glucose levels increases intraislet ROS via non-mitochondrial pathways and that this also might be responsible for adverse effects of high glucose levels on beta cell function. Taken together, our work and the reports cited above suggest that both mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial pathways may contribute ROS to the glucotoxic process, which may play an important role in the continual deterioration of beta cell function characteristic of type 2 diabetes.

Herein, we demonstrate that BCL10, a critical molecule that signals between the T cell receptor and IκB kinase complexes, is involved in the innate immune system and is required for appropriate TLR4 pathway and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation. In response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, BCL10 was recruited to TLR4 signaling complexes and associated with Pellino2, an essential component down-stream of BCL10 in the TLR4 pathway. In a BCL10-deficient macrophage cell line, LPS-induced NF-κB activation was consistently defective, whereas activator protein-1 and Elk-1 signaling was intact. In addition, we found that BCL10 was targeted by SOCS3 for negative regulation in LPS signaling. The recruitment of BCL10 to TLR4 signaling complexes was attenuated by induced expression of SOCS3 in a feedback loop. Furthermore, ectopic SOCS3 expression blocked the interaction between BCL10 and Pellino2 together with BCL10-generated NF-κB activation and inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression. Together, these data define an important role of BCL10 in the innate immune system.

All TLRs activate a common signaling pathway that culminates in the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) transcription factors as well as the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (2Akira S.

Additionally, Pellino3, a homolog with high sequence similarity to Pellino2, has been found to interact simultaneously with IRAK1, TRAF6, and TAK1 and to act as a scaffolding protein that may control signaling branch-point specificity leading to different activation pathways of NF-κB and MAPK (4Jensen L.E.

Johnston J.A. Steinlein P. Decker T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2640-2647PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been found that constitutive SOCS3 expression inhibits LPS-induced pro-inflammatory responses in J774 cells and that SOCS3 is required for the IL-10-mediated deactivation of primary peritoneal macrophages treated with LPS (11Berlato C.

Thus, SOCS3 may participate in LPS signaling by acting as a negative feedback regulator.BCL10 is an intracellular NF-κB activator that was originally found to be involved in t(1;14)(p22;q32) mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma translocation. This rearrangement results in the juxtaposition of the entire coding region of bcl10 with the chromosome under the control of the Ig enhancer element, which leads to deregulated expression of the BCL10 protein. BCL10 contains a caspase recruitment domain that is found exclusively in factors that mediate apoptotic signaling and NF-κB activation (12Willis T.G. Jadayel D.M. Du M.Q. Peng H. Perry A.R.

In addition, recent reports demonstrate that BCL10 is coprecipitated in IκB kinase (IKK) signaling complexes (20Poyet J.L. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3183-3187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, BCL10 takes part in regulating adaptive immune responses and is essential for the signal transduction from the TCR to IKK complexes (19Ruefli-Brasse A.A. Lee W.P. Hurst S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1570-1574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 21McAllister-Lucas L.M. Inohara N. Lucas P.C. Ruland J. Benito A. Li Q. Chen S. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S.

However, it remains unclear whether BCL10 is involved in the signaling pathways of the innate immune system.It has been reported recently that suppression of BCL10 expression renders marginal zone B cells unable to fully activate NF-κB in response to LPS stimulation and, moreover, that BCL10-deficient mice are very susceptible to bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae challenge and thus fail to clear bacteria from their bloodstream or to survive infection (22Xue L. Morris S.W. Orihuela C. Tuomanen E. Cui X. Wen R. Wang D. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), which hints that BCL10 might be a component of the innate immune system. In this case, BCL10 is postulated to act in a unique pathway specific for LPS signaling in marginal zone B cells.Here, we report that BCL10 interacts with Pellino2 and mediates NF-κB activation in response to LPS stimulation. In a mouse macrophage cell line treated with LPS, BCL10 was recruited to TLR4 signaling complexes, and SOCS3 played a role in blocking this recruitment in a classic feedback manner. Moreover, ectopic SOCS3 expression blocked the interaction between BCL10 and Pellino2. Our results demonstrate for the first time that BCL10 is an important signaling molecule that mediates signaling in the TLR4 pathway in the innate immune system.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Reagents—Anti-TLR4, anti-inducible nitric-oxide synthase, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG antibody was from Sigma. Anti-BCL10, anti-α-actin, and anti-SOCS3 antibodies were from Ptglab Co. Anti-hemagglutinin antibody was from Roche Diagnostics. LPS and recombinant tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was from Sigma.Mammalian Expression Plasmids—Mouse Pellino2, TAK1, and IKKβ were from Ptglab Co. Mouse SOCS3 and mouse BCL10 were from American Type Culture Collection. The expression constructs pCMV-FLAG-mPellino2, pcDNA3.1(+)-mBCL10, pcDNA3.1(+)-mSOCS3, and pHM-mSOCS3 were cloned in our laboratory. The cDNAs encoding the dominant-negative mutants TAK1(K63W) and IKKβ(K44M) were constructed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and subcloned into pCMV-FLAG. All mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Mutant forms of mouse Pellino2 with N-terminal 168- and 233-amino acid truncations were subcloned into the expression vector pCMV-FLAG.Cell Culture, Stable Transfection, and Treatment—The murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 (obtained from American Type Culture Collection) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Approximately 6 × 105 cells/well were seeded on 6-well plates and transfected 24 h later with each expression vector using Lipofectin 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The positive transformants were selected and cultured in the presence of 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Sigma). In all experiments, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS or 20 ng/ml recombinant human TNF-α (final concentrations).Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed with MPER™ protein extraction reagent (Pierce), and equal amounts of samples were loaded for SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was carried out on nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and detected with ECL reagent (Pierce). We carried out immunoprecipitation using an MPER™ immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce).Northern Blotting—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen), separated on a 2.4% formaldehyde-containing 1.0% agarose gel, and blotted onto a charged nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes and visualized by alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Diagnostics).NF-κB Assay—Cells were transfected with 900 ng of pNF-κB luciferase reporter (Stratagene) and 100 ng of pRL-TK Renilla reporter (Promega) in the absence or presence of the indicated expression plasmids. Cells were harvested after the indicated hours, and firefly luciferase activity was determined using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Renilla luciferase activity was determined to normalize transfection efficiencies.Elk-1 and c-Jun Assays—PathDetect™ in vivo signal transduction pathway reporting systems (Stratagene) were used to assess the in vivo activation of c-Jun and Elk-1. For analysis of c-Jun or Elk-1 activity, pFA2-c-Jun or pFA2-Elk-1 and pFR-Luc were cotransfected into cells. The pRL-TK Renilla reporter plasmid was included to normalize the transfection efficiency. Thirty-six hours post-transfection, cells were either left untreated or incubated with LPS for 30 min. Cells were then collected and lysed, and the luciferase activity in the cell lysates was determined.RNA Interference—For the mouse BCL10 small interfering RNA (siRNA) construct, the insert was prepared by annealing two oligonucleotides derived from mouse BCL10 cDNA sequence (40–58 bp). For the mouse Pellino2 siRNA construct, the insert was prepared by annealing two oligonucleotides derived from mouse Pellino2 cDNA sequence (207–225 bp). After transfected with pSUPER constructs, puromycin (1000 ng/ml)-resistant cell clones were isolated.T7Select Biopanning—A premade T7Select lung cDNA library (Novagen catalog no. 70646-3) and a liver tumor cDNA library (catalog no. 70647-3) were screened with the T7Select Biopanning kit (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The bait was bacterially expressed human BCL10 (pET28 vector, Novagen) purified by affinity chromatography. After four rounds of selection, 10 randomly selected clones were picked from each library, sequenced, and searched for homology to known sequences using the BLAST program (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST).RESULTSIdentification of Pellino2 and SOCS3 as BCL10-associated Proteins by the T7Select Phage Display System—In an effort to identify components in BCL10-related signaling pathways, we performed a screen for BCL10-associated proteins using the T7Select phage display system (Novagen). Six and eight positive clones (of a total of 20 randomly selected clones) encoding sequences identical to human Pellino2 and SOCS3 were identified in the lung and liver tumor cDNA libraries, respectively.BCL10 Interacts with Pellino2 in Response to LPS Stimulation—Pellino2 has been shown to participate in the TLR4 signaling pathways through facilitating the release of phosphorylated IRAK from the receptor and is essential for LPS-induced NF-κB activation. To further verify the interactions, we performed immunoprecipitation and confirmed that ectopic FLAG-tagged Pellino2 could interact with endogenous BCL10, which was precipitated by anti-BCL10 antibody in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1). Therefore, the potential interaction between BCL10 and Pellino2 leads to the hypothesis that BCL10 may be functionally related to the TLR4 signaling pathway, which is traditionally classified in the innate immune system.Pellino2 Associates with BCL10 through Region 169–233—In an attempt to map the region of Pellino2 required for BCL10 binding, we utilized two N-terminal deletion mutants, Pellino2(del168) and Pellino2(del233), with deletions of the N-terminal 168 and 233 amino acids, respectively. Because data base searches for conserved functional/structural domains in Pellino proteins did not reveal any significant matches, the construction strategy for truncated forms of Pellino2 is based on the analysis of predicted exon/exon boundaries, and the positions for truncation are two splice junctions in the pellino2 gene. In the subsequent immunoprecipitation assays, BCL10 could be coprecipitated with Pellino2(del168), whereas Pellino2(del233) did not exhibit any association with BCL10 (Fig. 2), indicating that region 169–233 of Pellino2 is essential for BCL10 interaction.Fig. 2Region 169–233 in Pellino2 is essential for BCL10 association. RAW264.7 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged N-terminal deletion mutants of mouse Pellino2. At 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with LPS for 30 min, and cell lysates were prepared. The anti-FLAG antibody immunoprecipitates (IP) were probed with anti-BCL10 antibody. Cell lysates were also probed with anti-FLAG or anti-BCL10 antibody. The control IgG immunoprecipitate was from cells transfected with Pellino2(del168).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Mouse Pellino2 Is Involved in NF-κB Activation Triggered by LPS Treatment or Overexpressed BCL10 —To further investigate the role of Pellino2 in BCL10-dependent signaling, we stably transfected the siRNA construct pSUPER-Pellino2 into RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 3A). In Pellino2-deficient RAW264.7 cells, LPS- or overexpressed BCL10-induced NF-κB activation was reduced to a certain level compared with that in wild-type cells (Fig. 3, B and C), further suggesting a potential role for BCL10 in mediating signals from the TLR through Pellino2. Recently, some controversy has arisen over the role of Pellino2 in NF-κB activation (3Yu K.Y. Kwon H.J. Norman D.A.M. Vig E. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. J.

Wesche H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 547: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We also could not confirm that expression of Pellino2 would result in NF-κB activation as reported (29Jensen L.E. Whitehead A.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, our data obtained with Pellino2-deficient RAW264.7 cells support the view that Pellino2 is required for optimal activation of NF-κB in response to LPS stimulation or BCL10 overexpression.Fig. 3Expression of Pellino2 siRNA in RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cells reduces LPS-stimulated or BCL10-dependent NF-κB activation.A, RAW264.7 cells were stably transfected with pSUPER-Pellino2, and pellino2 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) transcripts were assessed by Northern blot analysis. B, 900 ng of pNF-κB luciferase reporter and 100 ng of pRL-TK Renilla reporter were transfected into wild-type (WT) or Pellino2-deficient RAW264.7 cells. At 36 h after transfection, the cells were stimulated with LPS for 30 min, and luciferase reporter assays were carried out. Under the same conditions and at 30 h after transfection, the cells were incubated with TNF-α for 6 h, and luciferase reporter assays were carried out to ensure specificity. The -fold induction is relative to that in cells (wild-type or Pellino2-deficient) transfected with 1000 ng of reporter DNA without LPS or TNF-α stimulation. C, wild-type or Pellino2-deficient RAW264.7 cells were transfected with 900 ng of pNF-κB luciferase reporter and 100 ng of pRL-TK Renilla reporter in combination with increasing amounts of pHM-mBCL10 (500 and 1000 ng) and decreasing amounts of pHM6 (1000 and 500 ng). At 36 h after transfection, luciferase reporter assays were carried out. The -fold induction is relative to that in cells transfected with 1000 ng of reporter DNA and 1000 ng of pHM6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)BCL10-induced NF-κB Activation Is Partially Dependent on the Signals Transmitted through Pellino2 and TAK1—As widely described, BCL10 has been implicated in the transmittance of signals from antigen receptors to the IKK complex in the adaptive immune system. In RAW264.7 cells, we found that BCL10-induced NF-κB activation was moderately attenuated by cotransfection of Pellino2(del168) or a dominant-negative form of TAK1 and severely impaired by dominant-negative IKKβ expression (Fig. 4A). We also studied their effects following TNF-α stimulation to ensure the specificity (Fig. 4A). The inhibitory function of Pellino2(del168) suggests that Pellino2 is a critical scaffold protein downstream of BCL10 in the TLR pathway and, moreover, that the N-terminal 168 amino acids of Pellino2 are not essential for interaction between Pellino2 and BCL10, but are crucial for the downstream signaling cascade. In addition, we found that Pellino2(del168) (but not Pellino2(del233)) could still attenuate LPS-induced activation, further demonstrating a critical role for BCL10 in LPS signaling (Fig. 4B). Because both Pellino2 and TAK1 are functionally important signaling molecules in the TLR pathway, the results demonstrate that BCL10 functions as a signaling molecule in the classical innate immune system. Furthermore, it should be noted that the Pellino2 truncated mutant and dominant-negative TAK1 could not completely abolish BCL10-induced NF-κB activation, indicating that BCL10 also plays an essential role in other pathways.Fig. 4Dominant-negative TAK1, dominant-negative IKKβ, and Pellino2(del168) impair BCL10-dependent NF-κB activation.A, RAW264.7 cells were transfected with 900 ng of pNF-κB luciferase reporter, 100 ng of pRL-TK Renilla reporter, and 1000 ng of pcDNA3.1(+)-mBCL10 in combination with increasing amounts of pCMV-FLAG-Pellino2(del168), pCMV-FLAG-DN-TAK1, or pCMV-FLAG-DN-IKKβ (500 and 1000 ng) and decreasing amounts of pCMV-FLAG (1000 and 500 ng). At 36 h after transfection, luciferase reporter assays were carried out. The -fold induction is relative to that in cells transfected with 1000 ng of reporter DNA, 1000 ng of pcDNA3.1(+), and 1000 ng of pCMV-FLAG. Cell lysates were also probed with anti-FLAG antibody. As a control, RAW264.7 cells were transfected with 900 ng of pNF-κB luciferase reporter and 100 ng of pRL-TK Renilla reporter in combination with increasing amounts of pCMV-FLAG-Pellino2(del168), pCMV-FLAG-DN-TAK1, or pCMV-FLAG-DN-IKKβ (500 and 1000 ng) and decreasing amounts of pCMV-FLAG (1000 and 500 ng). At 30 h after transfection, the cells were incubated with TNF-α for 6 h, and luciferase reporter assays were carried out. The -fold induction is relative to that in cells transfected with 1000 ng of reporter DNA and 1000 ng of pCMV-FLAG without TNF-α treatment. B, RAW264.7 cells were transfected with 900 ng of pNF-κB luciferase reporter and 100 ng of pRL-TK Renilla reporter in combination with increasing amounts of pCMV-FLAG-Pellino2(del168) or pCMV-FLAG-Pellino2(del233) (500 and 1000 ng) and decreasing amounts of pCMV-FLAG (1000 and 500 ng). At 36 h after transfection, the cells were treated with LPS or TNF-α for 30 min, and luciferase reporter assays were carried out.

In the RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cell line stably transfected with the siRNA construct pSUPER-BCL10 (Fig. 5A), deficiency in BCL10 expression caused moderate reduction of NF-κB activation in response to LPS stimulation, whereas NF-κB activation triggered by TNF-α treatment was similar in both wild-type and BCL10-deficient RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 5B), which directly gives rise to the possibility that BCL10 might specifically signal downstream of TLR4. Pellino2 has been found to activate the AP-1 and Elk-1 pathways, and similarly, stimulation of TLRs by specific ligands also induces the activation of a set of MAPKs (29Jensen L.E. Whitehead A.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, we found that activation of the AP-1 and Elk-1 signaling pathways LPS stimulation was equivalent in both wild-type and BCL10-deficient RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 5C), indicating that the defect in BCL10 expression is specific for NF-κB signaling downstream of the TLR, but not for other parallel pathways initiated by LPS stimulation. Furthermore, even if Pellino2 is essential for activation of AP-1 and Elk-1, BCL10 seems to be an important adaptor that directs the signal specifically toward activation of NF-κB. In these processes, Pellino2 may act as a scaffolding protein that integrates the signal from BCL10 and ultimately controls signaling branch-point specificity.Fig. 5Defective NF-κB activation in RAW264.7 cells upon expression of BCL10 siRNA.A, lysates from RAW264.7 cells stably transfected with pSUPER-BCL10 or wild-type RAW264.7 cells were immunoblotted with anti-BCL10 antibody.

The pRL-TK Renilla reporter (100 ng) was included to normalize the transfection efficiency. Thirty-six hours post-transfection, the cells were stimulated with LPS for 30 min, and luciferase reporter assays were carried out.

Regulation of basal and inducible COX-2 gene expression in pancreatic β-cells is not fully understood. In this report, we used pancreatic β-cells (RINm5F) to explore the molecular mechanisms regulating COX-2 promoter activity. Through deletion analysis of a –907/+70-bp 5′ upstream region of the mouse COX-2 gene, we identified an inhibition domain (–804/–371) and an activation domain (–371/+70). The highest promoter activity was seen when the promoter was reduced to –371 bp. Several cis-acting elements were selected for site-directed mutations in the activation domain. We identified three sites that were essential for basal COX-2 promoter activity: 1) CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), 2) aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and 3) cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Single mutation of each individual site inhibited 70–80% of basal COX-2 promoter activity. Double mutation of the AhR and CREB-binding sites showed synergy in repressing COX-2 promoter activity as did mutation of all three sites. We demonstrated that the transcription factors from RINm5F nuclear extracts specifically bound to oligonucleotides containing C/EBP, AhR, or CREB consensus sites. Forskolin, an activator of adenyl cyclase, increased COX-2 promoter activity via the CREB site. COX-2 promoter activity was also increased by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, an AhR activator, through the AhR site. Both forskolin and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin increased COX-2 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner.

Even though COX-2 is absent under basal conditions in many tissues, the pancreatic β-cell is somewhat unique because COX-2 is constitutively active without exogenous stimuli (22Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Moreover, hyperglycemia appears to induce COX-2 mRNA in cultured human pancreatic islets (23Persaud S.J. Burns C.J. Belin V.D. Jones P.M. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S190-S192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon the addition of interleukin-1β, COX-2 mRNA and protein typically increase 3–4-fold, whereas end product PGE2 increases >100-fold (24Han X. Chen S. Sun Y. Nadler J.L. Bleich D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). More recently, inhibition of COX-2 was shown to preserve β-cell function (25Tran P.O. Gleason C.E. Poitout V. Robertson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31245-31248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and increased basal insulin secretion. 2D. Bleich, S. Mi, and F. Yang, unpublished data. COX-2 levels are relatively low in healthy β-cells. When β-cells are placed in a stressful environment, COX-2 gene expression is up-regulated (22Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Although COX-2 plays an important role in β-cell function and insulin secretion, no systematic study of COX-2 expression at the transcriptional level has been performed in pancreatic β-cells. One previous study showed that mutation of the NF-IL-6-binding motif reduced basal promoter activity by 50%, whereas IL-1β coordinately regulated increased NF-κB binding and decreased NF-IL-6 binding to the COX-2 promoter in HIT-T15 β-cells (26Sorli C. Zhang H.-J. Armstrong M.B. Rajotte R.V. Maclouf J. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1788-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, the molecular regulation of COX-2 gene in β-cells and pancreatic islet is incompletely understood. To investigate the transcriptional regulation of COX-2 promoter in pancreatic β-cells, we used a 1-kilobase mouse COX-2 gene 5′-flanking region (–907/+70 bp) linked to luciferase reporter gene in RINm5F β-cells. Through deletion studies, we found one activating domain (–371/+70 bp). We then identified three transcription factors that were required for basal COX-2 promoter activity: 1) cyclic AMP response-element binding protein (CREB), 2) aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and 3) CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP). We identified these by mutating cis-acting elements in the activating domain. Importantly, the induction of COX-2 promoter activity by forskolin, an adenyl cyclase activator, and TCDD, an AhR activator, was abolished by mutation of their respective promoter-binding sites. We also determined that nuclear extracts from RINm5F cells specifically bound the DNA elements containing CREB, AhR, and C/EBP sites. To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze in detail the COX-2 promoter in β-cells. These findings will be helpful for understanding or controlling β-cell function via modification of COX-2 gene expression. Experimental Reagents—Forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), and RPMI 1640 medium with l-glutamine were obtained from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum and antibiotics-antimycotics were obtained from Invitrogen. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). Forskolin, IBMX, and TCDD were dissolved in Me2SO. SuperFect transfection reagent and one-step RT-PCR kit were obtained from Qiagen. DNase I treatment and removal reagents were obtained from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX), and TRI reagent for total RNA isolation was purchased from the Molecular Research Center, Inc. (Cincinnati, OH). Cell Culture—RINm5F pancreatic β-cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (with l-glutamine) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, and 1% antibiotics-antimycotics at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The cultures were fed with fresh medium two times/week. Plasmid Construction—The various 5′ deleted fragments of mouse COX-2 promoter were derived from the plasmid pTIS10L (27Fletcher B.S. Kujubu D.A. Perrin D.M. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4338-4344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. Harvey Herschmann, UCLA School of Medicine) and amplified using PCR. The upstream and downstream PCR primers contained KpnI and XbaI restriction sites respectively. The fragments were digested by KpnI and XbaI and were inserted to the luciferase reporter vector pGL3 Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) that contained Firefly luciferase cDNA. The following primers were used: upstream primers, from –907, 5′-GGGGTACCGCAAATAATTTTTTATCAAACACTGTTTCTG; from –804, 5′-GGGGTACCCCGTTGCCATAACATACTTCTTGTAAACATGGA; from –568, 5′-GGGGTACCCGGAGGGTAGTTCCATGAAAGACTTCAACC; from –371, 5′-GGGGTACCGGGAGGGAAGCTGTGACACTCTTGAGCTTT; from –229, 5′-GGGGTACCGCTCTCTTGGCACCACCTGGGGCAGCC; from –149, 5′-GGGGTACCCGCTGCGGTTCTTGCGCAACTCACTGAGC; from –70, 5′-GGGGTACCCAGAGTCACCACTACGTCACGTGGAGTCCG; from –40, 5′-GGGGTACCCTTTACAGACTTAAAAGCAAGGTTC; and downstream primer +70, 5′-GAAGATCTCAGTGCTGAGATTCTTCGTGAGCAGAGTCC. Deletion constructs containing various promoter regions of mCOX-2 were named pCOX2 (–907/+70), pCOX2 (–804/+70), pCOX2 (–568/+70), pCOX2 (–371/+70), pCOX2 (–229/+70), pCOX2 (–149/+70), pCOX2 (–70/+70), and pCOX2 (–40/+70), relative to the transcription start site of the COX-2 gene. Restriction enzyme digestions and direct DNA sequencing (City of Hope Medical Center Core DNA Facility) were performed to confirm the proper sequence of all constructs. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutant COX-2 promoter constructs were made using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Construct pCOX2 (–371/+70) was used as a template for the other constructs. Mutant constructs were named by transcription factors. The consensus binding site of each transcription factor was mutated as shown in Tables I and II. The underlined nucleotides indicate the mutations. All of the mutations were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing.Table IMutations of cis-acting elements in the region –371/+70 bp of m-COX-2 promoterTF nameConsensus sequencesaOnly sense sequences are shown.MutationsPositionsSP-1GGGCGGTGTCTG-239NF-1TGGCATTTCA-222AhRGCGTGTTTTG-167GRCAGAGCATAT-120WT-1GAGGGGGAATAGTTGGAA-116C/EBPGTTGGGGTTTTG-95NF-κB1/2TGGGGATTTGTA-93CREBCGTCACTTAA-56E-boxCACGTGAAATTG-53a Only sense sequences are shown.

Open table in a new tab Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays—The day before transfection, RINm5F cells were plated into six-well tissue culture plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well. Transfections were performed using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's protocol. Each transfection was performed using 1.5 μg of Firefly luciferase reporter construct DNA that contained various deletions and site-directed mutants of COX-2 promoter gene plus 0.1 μg of an internal control Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid pRL-TK (Promega). 2.5 h after transfection, the medium was removed by aspiration and replaced with normal culture media containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Following an overnight recovery period, the transfected cells were cultured in medium with 0.2% BSA for 48 h. All of the treatments were performed in 0.2% BSA medium 24 h before cells were collected. The cell extracts were prepared for luciferase determination according to the protocol accompanying the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured with a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated two or three times independently. RNA Preparation and Relative RT-PCR—1 × 106 RINm5F cells were seeded in 60-mm culture dishes. On the next day, the cells were switched to 0.2% BSA medium for 24 h. The cells were changed to fresh 0.2% BSA medium and different concentrations of forskolin or TCDD were added. Fours hours later, the cells were collected, and total RNA was isolated with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center). To remove contaminating DNA, RNA samples were treated with DNase I, using DNase treatment and removal reagents (Ambion Inc.). RT-PCR assays were performed with the Qiagen One-Step RT-PCR kit. The sense and antisense primers for rat COX-2 were 5′-TGGTGCCGGGTCTGATGATG and 5′-GCAATGCGGTTCTGATACTG. The level of 18 S ribosomal RNA was used as an internal standard. The primers and competitors of 18 S RNA were from QuantumRNA™18S Internal Standards kit (Ambion, Inc.). The amplification process was conducted for 36 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 52 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. The RT-PCR products were fractionated on 1.2% agarose gels and photographed using an AlphaImager 2000 documentation and analysis system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Nuclear Extracts—3 × 106 RINm5F cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes in triplicate. Next day, the cells were switched to 0.2% BSA medium for 48 h to maintain the same culturing condition as the transfected cells used for luciferase assays. The cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in phosphate-buffered saline. Then the cells were centrifuged for 3 min at 3000 rpm, and the pellet was suspended in 300 μl Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). After centrifugation, the pellet was treated with 50 μl of low salt buffer (20 mm NaCl, 1mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9) and 50 μl of high salt buffer (1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9) with vortexing in a cold room. The mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 30 min followed by the addition of 100 μl of low salt buffer. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, the remaining supernatant was the nuclear extract. The protein concentrations were measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—The sense sequences of the oligonucleotides tested were as follows: AhR wild type, 5′-CTCTCATTTGCGTGGGTAAAAGCCTGC; AhR mutant, 5′-CTCTCATTTTTTTGGGTAAAAGCCTGC; C/EBP wild type, 5′-TTGGTGGGGGTTGGGGAAAGCCTAAGC; C/EBP mutant, 5′-TTGGTGGGGTCTGGGGAAAGCCTAAGC; CREB wild type, 5′-GTCACCACTACGTCACGTGGAGTCCGC; and CREB mutant, 5′-GTCACCACTATTGCACGTGGAGTCCGC. To prepare the double-stranded oligonucleotides, single-stranded forward and reverse oligonucleotides were annealed by heating to 95 °C and cooling slowly to room temperature in TEN buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 8.0). The double-stranded oligonucleotides (4 pmol) were then digoxigenin-labeled at the 3′ end with enzyme and reagents supplied in the DIG gel shift kit (Roche Applied Sciences). Binding reactions were conducted with 16 μg of nuclear protein and 0.4 ng of digoxigenin-labeled probe following the manufacturer's protocol. Binding complexes were separated on a 6% DNA retardation gel running at 75 V for 1.5 h, after which the gel was transferred to positive-charged nylon membrane by electro-blotting (30 min, 400 mA). The DNA was fixed to membrane by UV cross-link, and chemiluminescent signals were recorded on x-ray film. Statistics—Student's t test was used to evaluate statistical significance of differences between two groups. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analysis of Basal COX-2 Promoter Activity in Pancreatic β-Cells—Deletion mutants of COX-2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene constructs and control pGL3 Basic vector were transiently transfected into RINm5F cells for 72 h and relative luciferase activity (the ratio Firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase) of each reporter gene construct was measured as shown in Fig. 1. The –371/+70-bp region gave the highest level of COX-2 promoter activity. This finding is similar to the original report in COS-1 cells (27Fletcher B.S. Kujubu D.A. Perrin D.M. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4338-4344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) where two COX-2 promoter fragments, pTIS10L(–963/+70) and pTIS10S(–371/+70) were tested. Here, –371/+70 showed much higher promoter activity than –963/+70. Our serial promoter deletions from –907 bp to –371 bp showed a 5-fold increase in promoter activity, consistent with the notion that this region contains inhibitory domains. The deletions from –371 to –40 bp caused about 95% loss of luciferase activity. Luciferase activity of reporter construct pCOX2(–40/+70) was almost at the level of the pGL3 Basic vector. These results indicated that the region between –371 and –40 bp contains activation domains for basal COX-2 expression in β-cells. Because a presumptive TATA element is located at –30 bp, all of the reporter constructs of the COX-2 promoter contained this TATA element. Identifying COX-2 Promoter Activation Elements—One inhibition domain (–907/–371 bp) and one activation domain (–371/+70 bp) were identified from the results in Fig. 1. In further studies we focused on the activation domain. To investigate the transcriptional activators in this domain, we mutated presumptive cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements by site-directed mutagenesis (Table I). These sites were obtained by screening promoter region –371/+70 with two computer programs called Matrix Search for Transcription Factor Binding Sites (MATCH) and Pattern Search for Transcription Factor Binding Sites (PATCH) (provided by Transfac® Professional 7.4). If the binding sites of two transcription factors were close or overlapping, we mutated them at the same time and essentially eliminated two DNA-binding sites in one experiment. The factors that contained close sequences were NF-1/SP-1, and those that contained overlapping sequences were WT-1/glucocorticoid receptor, (NF-κB1/2)/C/EBP, and CREB/E-box. First, we picked five locations for site-directed mutations. We mutated these five locations separately and determined luciferase activities (Fig. 2). Compared with the wild type pCOX2(–371/+70), mutation of the NF-1/SP-1 site did not change the promoter activity, whereas mutation of the WT-1/glucocorticoid receptor site only decreased promoter activity by 30%. In contrast, mutation of the AhR site, the (NF-κB1/2)/C/EBP site or the CREB/E-box site caused major decreases in COX-2 promoter activity by 70%, 74%, and 84%, respectively. Because the AhR site contained no overlapping DNA-binding domains, we confirmed that AhR was essential for basal COX-2 expression in β-cells. Because the other two locations contain two transcriptional factors, we performed further studies to determine which factor was essential for COX-2 gene expression. CREB and C/EBP, but NotNF-κB1/2 or E-box, Are Essential for Basal COX-2 Expression—In Fig. 2, we mutated nucleotides overlapping the NF-κB1/2- and C/EBP-binding region and the CREB- and E-box-binding region. Thus, we could not determine which two sites were responsible for COX-2 promoter activation. To solve this problem, we mutated nonoverlapping binding sites in the NF-κB1/2 and C/EBP region and the CREB and E-box region and tested these new promoter constructs. As shown in Table II, the mutation sites were carefully selected so that we could discriminate between individual overlapping transcription factor-binding sites (e.g. NF-κB1/2- and C/EBP-binding domains shared bases –93 to –90; therefore, bases –89 and –88 were mutated in the NF-κB1/2 site, whereas bases –95 and –94 were mutated in the C/EBP site). Using the wild type pCOX2(–371/+70) construct and the four mutant constructs shown in Table II, we transiently transfected these reporter constructs into RINm5F cells and determined luciferase activities. As shown in Fig. 3, the NF-κB1/2 mutation did not inhibit the reporter activity, whereas the C/EBP mutation strongly repressed reporter activity by 73% compared with the wild type. Similarly, the E-box mutation slightly decreased reporter gene activity, whereas the CREB mutation strongly inhibited the promoter activity by 83%. These results indicated that C/EBP and CREB sites were essential for basal COX-2 expression in β-cells. Synergistic Effect of Mutations in AhR, C/EBP, and CREB Sites on COX-2 Promoter Activity—Although single mutation of the AhR-, C/EBP-, or CREB-binding site decreased promoter activity by 70–80%, it was unknown whether these sites worked synergistically in regulating the COX-2 promoter. To this end, we designed luciferase reporter constructs containing double mutations of the AhR and C/EBP sites, AhR and CREB sites, C/EBP and CREB sites, and mutation of all three sites. The relative luciferase activities of three double mutant constructs and a triple mutant construct are shown in Fig. 4. Double mutation of AhR and C/EBP sites or CREB and C/EBP sites did not show synergy, whereas double mutations of AhR and CREB sites exhibited a further 1.5–2-fold reduction in reporter activities compared with single mutations. The triple mutation of AhR, C/EBP, and CREB strongly repressed luciferase activity 2-fold more than the respective single mutation. These results indicated that no synergy existed between AhR and C/EBP sites or CREB and C/EBP, whereas significant synergy was seen between AhR and CREB sites or among all three sites. Cyclic AMP Activator, Forskolin, Increases COX-2 Promoter Activity and COX-2 mRNA Level—Based on the observation that mutation of the CREB site inhibited COX-2 promoter activity in β-cells (Figs. 3 and 4), we investigated whether increasing endogenous cAMP by adding the cAMP activators forskolin and IBMX could also increase COX-2 promoter activity. Forskolin, an adenyl cyclase activator, and IBMX, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, were chosen for these studies. RINm5F cells were transfected with pCOX2(–371/+70) luciferase reporter construct, and the next day, the cells were starved in 0.2% BSA medium for 24 h. The transfected cells were treated with forskolin (4 and 10 μg/ml) and IBMX (100 and 400 μm) for 24 h. Forskolin increased luciferase activity 3-fold when compared with untreated cells (Fig. 5), whereas IBMX increased luciferase activity 2-fold (data not shown). When the CREB site was mutated, forskolin could not increase the mutant reporter luciferase activity (Fig. 5). We also tested other two constructs, pCOX2(–804/+70) and pCOX2(–907/+70), which contained longer promoter fragment than pCOX2(–371/+70). Even though the –804/+70 bp and –907/ +70 bp fragments contained an inhibiting domain, the luciferase activities of pCOX2(–804/+70) and pCOX2(–907/+70) were still increased by the addition of forskolin (10 μg/ml) (Fig. 6). Because forskolin only increased the wild type COX-2 promoter activity but not the CREB site mutant promoter activity, this indicated that cAMP activators increased the transcription of COX-2 gene via the CREB-binding sites. So too, forskolin treatment increased COX-2 mRNA level of RINm5F cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7A). These experiments told us that the CREB site in the COX-2 promoter played an important role in both basal and induced expression of the COX-2 gene.Fig. 6Effect of forskolin on COX-2 promoter activity with different length of 5′-flanking DNA fragments. Transfected cells with pCOX2(–371/+70), pCOX2(–804/+70), or pCOX2(–907/+70) were starved 24 h in 0.2% BSA medium before forskolin treatment (10 μg/ml) for another 24 h in 0.2% BSA medium.

SK binding to Pg results in conformational expression of an active catalytic site on the zymogen without the usual strict requirement for peptide bond cleavage (14McClintock D.K. Bell P.H. Biochem.

Pm is generated subsequently by proteolytic cleavage of Arg561–Val562, and the SK·Pm complex propagates Pg activation through expression of a substrate recognition exosite (20Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 21Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol.

It is well established that both conformational and proteolytic activation contribute to SK-induced Pg activation, but there are a number of unresolved questions concerning the mechanism of conformational activation and its coupling to subsequent proteolytic Pm formation. Early studies (14McClintock D.K. Bell P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 43: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16Reddy K.N. Markus G. J. Biol.

Commun. 1974; 57: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) demonstrated that interaction of SK with Pg produced the activated Pg catalytic site in the SK·Pg* complex. Subsequent kinetic studies indicated that Pg activation involved an initially formed SK·Pg* activation complex and an isomerized form of the complex (22Chibber B.A. Radek J.T. Morris J.P. Castellino F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 23Chibber B.A. Morris J.P. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3429-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The isomerization was time-, chloride ion-, and fibrinogen-dependent, and the active complexes interconverted slowly under certain experimental conditions. In other studies, a species of Pg isolated from a mixture of SK and Pg was reported to be an active “virgin enzyme” form of free Pg*, suggesting irreversible conformational activation (24Summaria L. Wohl R.C. Boreisha I.G. Robbins K.C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2056-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The relationship between SK-Pg binding and conformational activation and its reversibility have not been clearly established. Previous studies of the mechanism of Pg activation by SK have not taken into account the binding affinities of SK for Pg and Pm species, primarily because consistent and reliable equilibrium binding constants have not been available. A number of studies have examined the binding interactions by various experimental approaches but have resulted in a very broad range of dissociation constants, varying from 28 pm to 220 nm for [Glu]Pg (25Sundram V.

Our equilibrium binding studies have employed active site-labeled fluorescent Pg and Pm analogs to quantitate SK binding in the absence of proteolytic reactions (21Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J.

The results for the active site-labeled proteins support a relatively low affinity of SK for [Glu]Pg, a 13–16-fold enhanced affinity for [Lys]Pg due to the expression of lysine-binding site interactions and a 3100–3500-fold further enhancement accompanying activation of the Pg catalytic domain. These changes in affinity account for a remarkable, overall ∼50,000-fold higher affinity of SK for the reaction product, [Lys]Pm, compared with the initial substrate, [Glu]Pg (21Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Boxrud P.D. Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13974-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Lysine-binding sites on the kringle domains of Pg and Pm participate in SK-induced Pg activation by mechanisms that are only partly understood. Conversion of Pg to Pm is inhibited by the lysine analog, 6-aminohexanoic acid (6-AHA) (35Alkjaersig N. Fletcher A.P. Sherry S. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 832-837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Lin L.F. Houng A. Reed G.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4740-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In our studies, 6-AHA reduced binding affinity of SK for [Lys]Pg and [Lys]Pm only partially but did not affect the affinity of SK for [Glu]Pg (21Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 28Bock P.E. Day D.E. Verhamme I.M. Bernardo M.M. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13974-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas others (36Lin L.F. Houng A. Reed G.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4740-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have reported weakening of [Glu]Pg binding by 6-AHA. The role of lysine-binding site interactions in modulating conformational activation of [Glu]Pg and [Lys]Pg is not clear. The goal of the present studies was to apply, for the first time, the combination of quantitative equilibrium binding and kinetic analysis required to define the mechanism of SK-induced Pg activation. Resolution of the conformational activation steps in the kinetic mechanism is characterized in the present paper, and coupling of the conformational and proteolytic activation pathway is reported in the companion paper (37Boxrud P.D. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36642-36649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The studies presented here address the relationship between SK-Pg binding and conformational activation, the nature of Pg*, the unknown role of differences in affinities of SK for [Glu]Pg and [Lys]Pg, and the roles of lysine-binding sites. The results demonstrate that Pg activation can be kinetically resolved into consecutive conformational and proteolytic activation steps at pH 7.4, I 0.15 m, and 25 °C. Conformational activation is induced by rapid equilibrium binding of SK to Pg and an accompanying reversible conformational change to form SK·Pg*. The mechanism of SK binding to fluorescein-labeled Pg involves at least two steps that can be resolved on the stopped-flow time scale. Kinetic separation of conformational and proteolytic activation allowed the substrate specificity of the transiently formed SK·Pg* complex to be characterized. The SK·Pg* complex exhibited significant decreases in substrate specificity for tripeptide p-nitroanilide substrates compared with that demonstrated previously for SK·Pm or Pm (21Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), indicating a unique active site specificity for Pg* in the SK·Pg* complex. The combined equilibrium binding and kinetic data under our experimental conditions did not reveal slowly formed, functionally distinguishable activator complexes and did not support formation of a virgin enzyme. These studies provide the first quantitative equilibrium binding and kinetic analysis of conformational Pg activation by SK, and demonstrate the critical role of differences in SK affinity for [Glu]Pg and [Lys]Pg and the differential roles of lysine-binding site interactions in regulating the activation mechanism. Protein Purification and Characterization—[Glu]Pg was purified from human plasma and separated into carbohydrate variants Pg1 and Pg2 by minor modifications of published procedures (38Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar, 39Castellino F.J. Powell J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Pm was prepared by activation of [Glu]Pg as described previously (28Bock P.E. Day D.E. Verhamme I.M. Bernardo M.M. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13143-13152Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). d-Phe-Phe-Arg-CH2Cl-blocked Pm (FFR-Pm) was prepared by incubation of 16 μm Pm with 80 μm d-Phe-Phe-Arg-CH2Cl (FFR-CH2Cl) for 1 h (>99.9% inhibition) in 5 mm Hepes, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm 6-AHA, 1 mg/ml PEG, pH 7.0 at 25 °C, followed by dialysis against >2000 volumes (with three changes) of 50 mm Hepes, 0.125 m NaCl, pH 7.4. When added to a 1 nm Pm assay containing 200 μm d-Val-Leu-Lys-pNA (VLK-pNA), 1.0 μm FFR-Pm was found to affect the rate of hydrolysis <3%, indicating no residual FFR-CH2Cl present in the preparation. [Lys]Pg was prepared by using a modified procedure from that described previously (33Boxrud P.D. Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13974-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), in which [Lys]Pg was chromatographed on soybean trypsin inhibitor-Sepharose in 10 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm 6-AHA, 1 mg/ml PEG, pH 7.4, at 4 °C to remove Pm and further purified on aminohexylagarose in 0.1 m KH2PO4, 0.2 m NaCl, pH 6.0, at 4 °C eluted with buffer containing 10 mm 6-AHA. SK was obtained from Diapharma as outdated therapeutic material and purified by chromatography on Pm-Sulfolink (28Bock P.E. Day D.E. Verhamme I.M. Bernardo M.M. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol.

Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using the following absorption coefficients ((mg/ml)–1 cm–1) and molecular weights: 0.95 and 47,000 for SK (41Taylor Jr., F.B. Botts J. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 232-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 42Jackson K.W. Tang J.

Olson S.T. Singh P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Active Site Fluorescent-labeled Pg—Nα-[(acetylthio)acetyl]-(d-Phe)-Phe-Arg-CH2Cl was prepared as described previously (45Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14963-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Bock P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 478-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and [Lys]Pg1 was active site-labeled as described (33Boxrud P.D. Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13974-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fluorescein incorporation was 0.8–0.9 mol of fluorescein/mol of Pg (28Bock P.E. Day D.E. Verhamme I.M. Bernardo M.M. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The protein preparations were homogeneous by SDS-PAGE. Fluorescence Binding Studies—Fluorescence equilibrium binding experiments were performed with an SLM 8100 spectrofluorometer in the ratio mode using acrylic cuvettes (Sarstedt) coated with polyethylene glycol 20,000 to minimize protein adsorption (47Latallo Z.S. Hall J.A. Thromb. Res. 1986; 43: 507-521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Excitation and emission wavelengths were 500 and 516 nm, respectively (8 nm bandpasses). The fractional change of the initial fluorescence intensity was expressed as (Fobs – Fo)/Fo = ΔF/Fo from data collected from several cuvettes encompassing overlapping segments of the titration curves. Competitive binding of native [Lys]Pg for SK was performed by measuring the fluorescence changes after addition of 100 or 500 nm SK to mixtures of [Lys]Pg1 and 15 nm [5-F]FFR[Lys]Pg1 in 50 mm Hepes, 0.125 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml PEG, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, ±10 mm 6-AHA, as indicated, at pH 7.4 and 25 °C. Competitive titrations with native [Glu]Pg1 were performed similarly, with 500 nm SK and 15 nm [5-F]FFR[Glu]Pg1. Addition of SK to a mixture of [5-F]FFR[Glu]Pg or [5-F]FFR[Lys]Pg in the presence of the respective native Pg species resulted in a rapid fluorescence change that was stable for >30 s, which was taken as the rapidly established competitive equilibrium value, followed by slower changes over several minutes due to proteolysis. To obtain the most reliable measurements, only one addition of SK per cuvette was used. Competitive titration data collected as a function of total native Pg concentration were fit simultaneously with the competitive cubic binding equation (48Lindahl P. Raub-Segall E. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 49Olson S.T. Bock P.E. Sheffer R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using SCIENTIST (MicroMath) to obtain the maximum fluorescence change (ΔFmax/Fo), dissociation constant for SK binding to labeled Pg, and competitive dissociation constant for binding of SK to native Pg. Parameters are reported as ± 2 S.D. Chromogenic Substrate Kinetics—Initial rates of substrate hydrolysis (<5% substrate depletion) were measured at 405 nm and 25 °Cin50 mm Hepes, 0.125 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml PEG, pH 7.4, in polyethylene glycol 20,000-coated cuvettes. All substrates were from commercial sources except Pro-Gly-Arg-pNA, which was synthesized by SynPep (Dublin, CA) and was 98% pure. Concentrations of peptide-pNA substrates were determined from the absorbance at 342 nm by using an absorption coefficient of 8,266 m–1 cm–1, and product concentrations were calculated by using an absorption coefficient of 9,933 m–1 cm–1 (50Lottenberg R. Jackson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Plasminogen Activation Kinetics—Activation of Pg by SK was measured by continuous monitoring of the increase in absorbance of VLK-pNA at 405 nm (ΔA405 nm). The parabolic progress curves of pNA formation were fit by Equation 1 (15Wohl R.C. Summaria L. Arzadon L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol.

Linear transformation of the continuous assay time courses was accomplished by dividing ΔA405 nm by t (52Kosow D.P. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4459-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Kinetic Model of Plasminogen Activation by Streptokinase—The observed dependence of v1 on SK concentration can be described by the mechanism shown in Scheme 1.Scheme 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In this model, SK binds to Pg with the dissociation constant KA to form a reversible, conformationally activated SK·Pg* complex, which can bind chromogenic substrate (S) with Michaelis constant Km and generate product with catalytic rate constant kc. As will be shown, the assumption in this model that SK·Pg* formation is reversible is valid. In addition, SK·Pg* can bind Pg as a substrate with a dissociation constant KS to form the ternary Michaelis complex (SK·Pg*·Pg) and generate Pm with the catalytic rate constant k0. This study characterizes Pg binding to SK, resolves the processes involved in conformational activation of Pg resulting in formation of the activated SK·Pg* complex, and quantifies the kinetic parameter KS for Pg binding. The companion paper (37Boxrud P.D. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36642-36649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) describes the coupled proteolytic mechanism of Pm generation by the activated SK·Pg* complex and formation of the SK·Pm complex that catalyzes Pg activation to Pm. The observed progress of activity formation is given by Equation 1, where v1 and v2 represent the rate of chromogenic substrate turnover by SK·Pg* and the rate of generation of Pm, respectively. From the Michaelis-Menten equation and the equilibrium binding expression for SK binding to Pg, v1 for the model in Scheme 1 is given by Equation 2, where [S]0 is the total substrate concentration.v1=kc[SK·Pg*]free[S]0(Km+[S]0)=kc[SK]free[Pg]free[S]0KA(Km+[S]0)(Eq. 2) Solving the SK mass balance equation for [SK]free in terms of [Pg]free gave Equation 3, where [SK]0 is the total SK concentration,[SK]free=[SK]01+[Pg]freeKA(1+[S]0Km)+[Pg]free2KAKS(Eq. 3) and substitution of Equation 3 into Equation 2 gave Equation 4.v1=kc[Pg]free[SK]0[S]0(KA+[Pg]free(1+[S]0Km)+[Pg]free2KS)(Km+[S]0)(Eq. 4) Solving the mass conservation equation for [Pg]free gave the cubic Equation 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as an exact solution in terms of the total concentrations, dissociation, and kinetic constants.D1([Pg]free)3+D2([Pg]free)2+D3([Pg]free)+D4=0 (Eq. 5) D1=1(Eq. 6) D2=Ks(1+[S]0Km)+2[SK]0−[Pg]0 (Eq. 7) D3=KAKS+KS[SK]0(1+[S]0Km)−KS[Pg]0(1+[S]0Km)(Eq. 8) D4=−KAKS[Pg]0(Eq. 9) Under conditions where [Pg]free « KS which were found to apply, Equation 4 can be reduced to Equation 10.v1=kc[Pg]free[SK]0[S]0(KA+[Pg]free(1+[S]0Km))(Km+[S]0)(Eq. 10) When [S]0 « Km, Equation 10 is reduced to Equation 11.v1=kc[Pg]free[SK]0[S]0Km(KA+[Pg]free)(Eq. 11) In this situation, [Pg]free is defined by the quadratic Equation 12,[Pg]free=[Pg]0−[SK]0−KA+([Pg]0−[SK]0−KA)2+4[Pg]0KA2(Eq. 12) v1 rates obtained from activation progress curves as a function of SK and Pg concentrations were analyzed both by fitting with Equations 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 describing the model without assumptions about the magnitude of KS and with the simplified Equations 11 and 12, assuming [Pg]free « KS and [S]0 « Km. Rapid Reaction Kinetics—The kinetics of SK binding to [5-F]FFR-[Glu]Pg2 and [5-F]FFR[Lys]Pg1 were studied by stopped-flow fluorometry with an Applied Photophysics SX-18MV stopped-flow spectrofluorometer in single mixing mode, with excitation at 500 nm and a 515-nm cut-on filter for emission. Progress curves of the fractional changes of the initial fluorescence intensity (ΔF/Fo) of 20 nm [5-F]FFR[Lys]Pg1 were obtained at saturating (5 μm) SK concentration in 50 mm Hepes, 0.125 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml PEG, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, at pH 7.4 and 25 °C, in the absence and presence of 50 mm 6-AHA. Data were fit by a biexponential equation to obtain the rate constants for the fast and slow phases observed. Dissociation of the SK·Pg* Complex with Active Site-blocked Pm— The chromogenic substrate activity of the SK·Pg* complex, formed by incubation of 10 nm [Lys]Pg1 with 50 nm SK for 2 min in pH 7.4 buffer containing 50 mm 6-AHA at 25 °C, was measured by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 405 nm after addition of 200 μm VLK-pNA. Dissociation of the complex by competitive binding of FFR-Pm was achieved by addition of varying concentrations of FFR-Pm after the formation of SK·Pg*. Following 2 min of incubation, substrate was added to measure the remaining active SK·Pg*. Alternatively, reactions were initiated by addition of SK to mixtures of Pg, FFR-Pm, and substrate that had been pre-equilibrated for 5 min. All progress curves in buffer containing 50 mm 6-AHA were nearly linear and gave v1, the rate of chromogenic substrate turnover by SK·Pg*, as a function of FFR-Pm concentration. The results were fit by the cubic binding equation for competitive binding of Pg and FFR-Pm to SK (48Lindahl P. Raub-Segall E. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 49Olson S.T. Bock P.E. Sheffer R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), with the dissociation constant for FFR-Pm and SK fixed at the independently determined value of 0.22 nm (33Boxrud P.D. Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13974-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Specificity of SK·[Lys]Pg* for Tripeptide-pNA Substrates—Kinetic parameters for hydrolysis of tripeptide-pNA substrates by SK·[Lys]Pg* were obtained by fitting Equation 1 to results of reactions of 1–100 nm [Lys]Pg2 initiated with saturating SK (500–1000 nm). The resulting v1 rates as a function of chromogenic substrate concentration were fit by the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain Km and kc for the SK·Pg* complex.

Pairwise interactions between 15 recombinant Yersinia outer proteins (Yops), regulators, and chaperones were first identified by SPR. Mass spectrometry confirmed over 80% of the protein-protein interactions suggested by SPR, and new binding partners were further characterized. The Yop secretion protein (Ysc) M2 of Yersinia enterocolitica and LcrQ of Y. pestis, formerly described as ligands only for the specific Yop chaperone (Syc) H, formed stable complexes with SycE. Additional previously unreported complexes of YscE with the translocation regulator protein TyeA and the thermal regulator protein YmoA and multiple potential protein contacts by YscE, YopK, YopH, and LcrH were also identified. Because only stably folded proteins were examined, the interactions we identified are likely to occur either before or after transfer through the injectosome to mammalian host cells and may have relevance to understanding disease processes initiated by the plague bacterium.

The Yop secretion protein (Ysc) M2 of Yersinia enterocolitica and LcrQ of Y. pestis, formerly described as ligands only for the specific Yop chaperone (Syc) H, formed stable complexes with SycE. Additional previously unreported complexes of YscE with the translocation regulator protein TyeA and the thermal regulator protein YmoA and multiple potential protein contacts by YscE, YopK, YopH, and LcrH were also identified. Because only stably folded proteins were examined, the interactions we identified are likely to occur either before or after transfer through the injectosome to mammalian host cells and may have relevance to understanding disease processes initiated by the plague bacterium. The plague bacillus Yersinia pestis and many other Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria use a cell contact-dependent, type III secretion system (TTSS) 1The abbreviations used are: TTSS, type three secretion system; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight; RU, refractive unit(s); SPR, surface plasmon resonance; YopH/N, amino-terminal (amino acids 1-129) part of YopH; YopH/C, carboxyl-terminal (amino acids 164-468) part of YopH; LCR, low Ca2+ response stimulon; SEC, size exclusion chromatography. for the highly regulated transport of virulence factors across the bacterial cell envelope and into host cells. Yersiniaouter proteins (Yops) are virulence factors encoded by a 70-kb plasmid (pCD1) of Y. pestis. An estimated 44 of the 96 potential open reading frames on pCD1 encode proteins that are directly involved in the assembly and regulation of the TTSS (Table I). There are 29 Yop secretion (Ysc) proteins, and within this group 10 have homologs in the bacterial flagellum (1Kubori T. Matsushima Y. Nakamura D. Uralil J. Lara-Tejero M. Sukhan A. Galan J.E. Aizawa S.I. Science. 1998; 280: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). A larger number are conserved in other type III secretion systems. The Ysc proteins assemble into the injectosome, a macromolecular delivery system that directs the vector translocation of at least six effector Yops (YopE, YopH, YopJ, YopM, YopT, and YpkA) from the bacterium directly into the cytosol of mammalian cells (for a review, see Ref. 2Cornelis G.R.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6793-6799Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) are delivered. The cellular targets of some Yops are known. For example, YopH is a potent tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates macrophage p130Cas and focal adhesion kinase proteins and disrupts focal adhesions (5Andersson K. Magnusson K.E. Majeed M. Stendahl O. Fallman M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bliska J.B. Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2002; 9: 971-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) is facilitated by formation of a complex between the secreted protein and a specific Yop chaperone (Syc) also encoded by pCD1. The three other effectors, YopJ, YopM, and YopO (YpkA), do not appear to require cognate secretion chaperones for transport (13Birtalan S.C. Phillips R.M. Ghosh P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 971-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Comparatively little is known about the transient interactions involved in the assembly of the injectosome, the precise order of assembly and delivery of the bacterial proteins into mammalian cells, and the energy source for the transport. To add to the complexity of the problem, protein-RNA and protein-DNA interactions are postulated for some components of the TTSS (14Cambronne E.D. Schneewind O. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5880-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Darwin K.H. Miller V.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1850-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Deleting any single component of the TTSS attenuates bacterial virulence, suggesting that the Yops, Sycs, and other accessory proteins assemble into a large multisubunit complex. As an essential component of the coordinately regulated low Ca2+ response stimulon (LCR) of pCD1, LcrF stimulates maximum expression of LcrV and Yops at 37 °C, and this activation step requires host cell contact or Ca2+ depletion (16Skurnik M. Toivanen P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2047-2051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Yother J. Chamness T.W. Goguen J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 443-447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As an approach to study the assembly of the Y. pestis virulence machinery, we used a two-step screening process to identify direct interactions between pairs of TTSS proteins. Protein interactions were first detected by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and then classified according to the strength of interaction at equilibrium. Positive interactions indicated by SPR were next confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Our results suggest that the combination of SPR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is a powerful method for rapidly identifying protein-protein interactions involved in complex macromolecular assemblies such as the type III secretion system. Protein Expression and Purification—The open reading frames encoding Y. pestis YopK, LcrG, LcrH, LcrQ, and YmoA were amplified from genomic DNA from Y. pestis biovar Orientalis, strain 195/P, kindly provided by Pat Worsham (United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases), by PCR using gene-specific primers with unpaired 5′ extensions that added a tobacco etch virus protease recognition site and a hexahistidine tag (His6 tag) to the amino and carboxyl termini of each open reading frame, respectively. Because the Y. pestis and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis protein LcrQ is identical in amino acid sequence to YscM1 of Yersinia enterocolitica, both proteins will be referred to as YscM1 to avoid confusion. These amplicons were subsequently used as the template for a second PCR with primers PE-277 and PE-278 (18Evdokimov A.G. Tropea J.E. Routzahn K.M. Waugh D.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which are designed to anneal to the tobacco etch virus site and His tag, respectively, and add integrase bacterial attachment site recombination sites to the ends of the amplicon. The final PCR amplicon was inserted by recombinational cloning first into pDONR201 (Invitrogen) and then into the Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein fusion vector pKM596 as described previously (19Fox J.D. Waugh D.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 205: 99-117PubMed Google Scholar). Expression vectors for the production of Y. pestis YopR, TyeA, YscP, and YscE were constructed in a similar fashion except that the His6 tag was positioned between the tobacco etch virus protease recognition site and the amino terminus of the Y. pestis protein instead of at its carboxyl terminus. The same strategy was used to produce YopM and YscM2 using genomic DNA from Y. enterocolitica (strain WA, serotype 0:8) kindly provided by Susan Straley (University of Kentucky). A polypeptide comprising residues 1-138 of Y. pestis SycH was co-expressed in E. coli with residues 29-78 of Y. pestis YscM1 fused to the carboxyl terminus of myelin basic protein. A substantial amount of free (uncomplexed) SycH and YscM1 was isolated as byproducts of the procedure used to purify the SycHYscM1 complex. The untagged, carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain of YopH (D356A mutant) was expressed from a T7 promoter vector as described previously (19Fox J.D. Waugh D.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 205: 99-117PubMed Google Scholar). Untagged Y. pestis SycE, amino-terminal domain of Y. pestis YopH (residues 1-130), and F1 (residues 1-170) were produced as described previously (18Evdokimov A.G. Tropea J.E. Routzahn K.M. Waugh D.S.

All recombinant Yersinia proteins were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified to homogeneity (determined by SDS gel electrophoresis) by a combination of affinity methods (amylose affinity chromatography and/or immobilized metal affinity chromatography) and conventional (size exclusion and ion exchange) chromatographic techniques. For some preparations, affinity columns were used to remove proteins containing affinity tags after enzymatic cleavage to yield native polypeptides. The molecular weights of the final products were confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Surface Plasmon Resonance—All measurements were performed on a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Protein immobilization, binding experiments, and data analysis were performed with preexisting templates supplied with the instrument's software. In a typical experiment, 2,000-3,000 response units (RU)/flow cell of protein was immobilized on a CM5 chip using the amine coupling method. For binding experiments, each protein analyte in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl was passed over a chip surface at a flow rate of 20 μl/min for 3 min at 37 °C. The dissociation was followed for about 2 min in the same buffer, and the surface was regenerated with 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 2 m NaCl. The cycle was repeated for every protein in the set. The chip surface was reused for up to 50 binding experiments. Data models were fitted using Biacore software and exported to the Kaleidagraph program (Synergy Software, Inc.) for plotting. All kinetic measurements were made at 20 °C to extend the performance of the derivatized biosensor surfaces. In a typical experiment, 200-900 RU of protein was immobilized in a flow cell of a CM5 chip using a standard amine coupling method. A test of concentration ranges and flow rates was used to optimize binding conditions, and duplicates of each analyte concentration were performed for kinetic analyses. Data were fitted to a Langmuir binding model assuming stoichiometric (1:1) interactions and exported to Origin (Microcal Software, Inc.) for graphical presentation. Mass Spectrometry—In a typical experiment, proteins and buffer were mixed together to give a total of 20 μl of sample volume with a 5 μm final concentration of each protein in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl. The solution was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and then a 5-μl aliquot was added to 3 μl of matrix (10 mg/ml sinapinic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v)) to give a 1.67:1 protein to matrix ratio (v/v). For mass spectra analysis, 1 μl of the protein-matrix solution was placed on a stainless steel sample grid, and the spectra were acquired in delayed extraction mode using an externally calibrated Applied Biosystems Voyager-DE mass spectrometer (Framingham, MA) with the following operating conditions: an accelerating voltage of 25 kV, a grid voltage of 93.2%, and a guide wire voltage of 0.3%. The scanned mass range was m/z 2,000 to approximately m/z 380,000, and 128 scans were averaged to yield each spectrum. The lowest possible laser power was used to generate spectra to prevent artificial peak formation. The TTSS polypeptides were expressed as full-length proteins or structural domains that were either native or His-tagged to facilitate purification (Table I). Criteria for inclusion of products in this study were that the proteins were required to be highly purified and stable in solution. Therefore, a final 15 of the potential 44 TTSS proteins were studied. Average surface densities of 3,000 RU and analyte concentrations of 0.5-5 μm for each protein were used in SPR studies to favor higher affinity interactions. Preliminary studies performed at various pH values confirmed that the His6 tag present on some recombinant TTSS proteins did not directly influence protein binding. A matrix analysis (16 × 16) was performed, allowing each protein to be examined both covalently immobilized on the biosensor surface and also as an analyte free in solution. Each SPR measurement provided information about the relative strength and kinetics of interactions. Due to a high propensity of some TTSS proteins to form homodimers, the stoichiometry of binding interactions was ignored. Data below 50 RU were considered background, 50-100 RU were considered weak, 100-300 RU were considered medium, and above 300 RU were considered strong interactions. Although most of the recombinant proteins were similar in molecular mass, this classification was reassessed for smaller or larger proteins. A summary of all interactions is presented in Fig. 1. From a potential 256 SPR interactions examined, 227 (88%) were nonproductive, 12 (5%) were weak, 9 (4%) were medium, and 8 (3%) were strong. Due to the amine coupling method used to immobilize proteins to the chip surface, the orientation influenced the interactions between some pairs of proteins. For example, when SycH was immobilized, binding to the YopH amino-terminal domain (YopH/N) was weak. Conversely, when YopH/N was immobilized, the interaction with SycH was stronger. To confirm the interactions initially identified by SPR, we next examined complex formation by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Representative mass spectra and a summary of the data are presented in Fig. 2 and Table II, respectively. The majority of the protein interactions detected by SPR (22 of 26) were confirmed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1). For example, the high affinity interactions between YscM2-SycH and YopH/NSycH also produced strong mass/charge signals (Fig 2, A and B). The interactions between TyeA and YopK, although weak by SPR, were still sufficient to detect complex formation by MALDI-TOF (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the weak interactions between YmoA and SycH detected by SPR were not be confirmed by MALDI-TOF. Similarly the weak interactions between LcrG and F1 or YopK, identified by SPR, were not observed by mass spectrometry. The SPR results for YopH/N-TyeA interactions using a high ligand density surface were initially ambiguous. Upon re-evaluation with lower density surfaces we could not observe YopH/N-TyeA complex formation nor was complex observed in solution (see below). However, a YopH/N-TyeA species was detected by MALDI-TOF, hence the assignment of “weak” interactions for this particular complex. While data from MALDI-TOF and SPR were complimentary, a comparison of results also allowed us to eliminate some tentative complex assignments.Table IIProtein-protein interactions of the Y. pestis TTSS measured by MALDI-TOFProtein pairMolecular mass, experimentalMolecular mass, calculatedComplex formationMolecular mass of complexExperimentalCalculatedDaDaDaYmoA8,9558,943.2Yes30,66630,822.8YopK21,81121,879.6YmoA8,8258,943.2Yes20,29020,475.9TyeA11,53411,531.9YmoA8,8188,943.2NoN/AaN/A, not applicable.N/ASycH15,41915,437.5YopK21,81221,879.6Yes37,36837,317.1SycH15,53615,437.5YopK21,81621,879.6NoN/AN/ALcrG11,94611,899.5YscE8,4018,345.5Yes22,97323,034.9SycE14,63214,649.6YscE8,5008,345.5Yes28,19428,278.9LcrH19,93319,894.4YscE8,5008,345.5Yes17,61717,327.7YmoA8,9558,943.2YscE8,5008,384.5NoN/AN/ATyeA11,63511,531.9YscM1/N-termbN-term, amino-terminal part.6,4276,536.3Yes21,11521,308.8YopH/N14,75214,772.5YscM1/N-term6,4286,536.3Yes21,77921,973.8SycH15,41015,437.5YscM1/N-term6,4166,536.3Yes21,05021,095.9SycE14,65914,649.6YscM213,64913,757.8Yes28,994cA 2:1 stoichiometric complex of SycH-YscM2 was also detected.29,195.3SycH15,48515,437.5YscM213,65413,757.8Yes25,11425,353.9TyeA11,53611,531.9YscM213,80013,757.8Yes35,40835,637.1YopK21,81121,879.6YscM213,64913,757.8Yes33,42533,652.2LcrH19,86419,894.4YscM213,64913,757.8Yes28,00528,407.4SycE14,71914,649.6YscM213,65513,757.8Yes28,33628,530.3YopH/N14,75414,772.5YscM213,66713,757.8NoN/AN/AYscE8,3958,345.5YopH/N14,76014,772.5Yes26,23126,314.4TyeA11,55411,531.9YopH/N14,75814,772.5Yes36,58136,652.1YopK21,82221,879.6YopH/N14,76614,772.5Yes30,09130,210.0SycH15,48515,437.5YopH/N14,77614,772.5Yes30,24530,420.8F115,52815,648.3dThe mass of recombinant F1 antigen was determined with ProtParam (47) from the sequence of the mature form of protein.F115,54215,648.3dThe mass of recombinant F1 antigen was determined with ProtParam (47) from the sequence of the mature form of protein.NoN/AN/ALcrG11,97411,899.5TyeA11,54811,531.9Yes33,26933,411.5YopK21,81321,879.6TyeA11,53111,531.9Yes31,30731,426.3LcrH19,84919,894.4a N/A, not applicable.b N-term, amino-terminal part.c A 2:1 stoichiometric complex of SycH-YscM2 was also detected.d The mass of recombinant F1 antigen was determined with ProtParam (47Wilharm G.

Open table in a new tab To investigate the potential protein-protein interactions in more detail, we performed a detailed kinetic analysis of select binding pairs by SPR (Fig. 3 and Table III). In addition, we also examined stable complex formation at equilibrium by mixing both components free in solution and isolating fractions by size exclusion chromatography (SEC; Table III). The measured Kd values varied from low micromolar (YopH/N-SycH) to nanomolar range (SycH-YscM1). Binding affinities for SycH to ligands were: YscM1 > YscM2 ≥ YopH/N. In addition, all of the SycH complexes were stable in solution (Table III). The association rate for YscM1 was the fastest of the three SycH binding partners, but dissociation rates were almost identical. In contrast, YopH/N and YscM2 had very similar kon and koff rates for interaction with SycH, suggesting that the preferred binding partner for SycH was YscM1. The SycE-YscM1 and SycEYscM2 complexes, not previously reported, were stable (Table III) when subjected to SEC. The YscM2-SycE complex had a relatively slow koff rate (Table III) favoring stability in solution as detected by SEC. Despite very fast kon and koff rates, YscM1-SycE complexes were also detected by SEC, whereas the fast kon and koff rates and consequential low affinity (Kd > 5 μm, Table III) of TyeA-YscE interactions (Fig. 3 and Table III) did not favor complex formation with both partners in solution (SEC results). In addition, the sharp rise and drop of the signal in the binding and dissociation phases, respectively, of the YscM2-SycE sensogram (Fig. 3B) indicated fast kon and koff rates. The association rate for the SycH-YopH/N chaperone-ligand pair (Fig. 3B) was relatively fast, but dissociation was slow, indicating a more stable interaction under the conditions examined. Finally the weak YopK-TyeA interactions (Fig. 3C), exhibiting fast kon and koff rates, were not described previously.Table IIIKinetic analysis of select TTSS interacting protein pairsProtein pairaAnalysis by surface plasmon resonance immobilized to biosensor surface, first protein; in solution (analyte), second protein.KdbKd values were calculated as ratios of ka/kd determined from kinetic experiments.

Open table in a new tab Few direct measurements are available for interactions between individual components of the TTSS, an essential virulence apparatus for several pathogenic bacterial species. Therefore, the results reported here may provide additional insight into the molecular mechanisms of bacterial virulence. We used recombinant TTSS proteins to identify new binding partners using two independent biophysical methods and provide additional data for previously observed protein-protein interactions. Not all TTSS components could be examined because many are presently difficult to produce as stable recombinant proteins. In addition, secondary and three-dimensional structures for most of these proteins are unknown. The membrane-spanning portion of the injectosome is hypothesized to serve as a conduit for the translocation of several proteins. For the previously reported SptP effector protein of Salmonella (22Stebbins C.E. Galan J.E. Nature. 2001; 414: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), binding to the SicP chaperone occurs in a partially unfolded state. Together with the fact that the narrow diameter of the external injectosome seems incompatible with the passage of folded, globular proteins, this suggests that effector proteins may be secreted before acquiring their native conformations. Alternatively secretion may favor partially unfolded proteins present in equilibrium with folded species. In any case, if unfolding is a prerequisite for type III secretion, then the potential interactions we identified are likely to occur either before or after this stage in the process. As only stably folded proteins were used in our study, the potential contribution of very hydrophobic or disordered polypeptides to binding interactions could not be addressed. The observed stoichiometry for all protein complexes we detected by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was 1:1 (Table II) with the exception of a mixture of 1:1 and 2:1 for SycH-YscM2. Yet the secretion chaperones are presumed to exist as homodimers in solution. For example, a crystal structure of the SycE-YopE complex (13Birtalan S.C. Phillips R.M. Ghosh P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 971-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) revealed that a dimer of SycE (residues 1-122) binds to one YopE truncated to residues 17-85 (2:1 stoichiometry). We also detected a 2:1 complex of SycE-YopE (data not shown) by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis using YopE truncated to residues 15-85 and co-expressed with SycE (residues 1-122). In contrast, a 1:1 complex was also observed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of SycE and the amino terminus of YopE (residues 1-90) co-expressed in E. coli (data not shown), suggesting that protein length contributes to the final complex formed. Hence the significance of the stoichiometry observed in the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry experiments is uncertain. Nevertheless we are confident that the results are qualitatively valid for two reasons. First, we detected complexes between all pairs of proteins that were previously shown by other means to interact with each other (YopH/H-SycH, YscM1-SycH, YscM2-SycH, and SycE-YopE). Second, several pairs of apparently non-interacting proteins, as determined by SPR, were also analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (SycH-YscP, SycH-YopR, SycE-YscP, and SycE-YopR), and in no case were any complexes detected (data not shown). Most previously reported binary complexes of TTSS components were identified by inference using genetic deletions for example, and hence very little quantitative data are available for these interactions. It is less likely that many of the protein-protein interactions identified in our study could be identified by these traditional methods. However, the biological significance of the contacts we observed has yet to be investigated. An examination of previous reports concerning the regulatory role of certain TTSS components suggests that our results may contribute to understanding some key steps in the assembly and function of the macromolecular secretion complex. Closure or disassembly of the contact-dependent secretion channel turns Yop synthesis off. The regulatory protein YscM1 is linked indirectly to controlling Yop expression and is produced by all pathogenic Yersinieae. Whereas YscM2 is expressed only by Y. enterocolitica and remains associated with the bacteria, it shares 59% sequence identity with YscM1 and is believed to be functionally equivalent (23Cambronne E.D. Cheng L.W. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, SycH is required for secretion of YopH, YscM1, and YscM2 by Y. enterocolitica (23Cambronne E.D. Cheng L.W. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Prior to contact with mammalian host cells, SycH was proposed (24Wulff-Strobel C.R. Williams A.W. Straley S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) to interact with YscM1 in a hypothetical secretion substrate acceptor site, leading to down-regulation of Yop expression, while cell contact stimulates secretion of YscM1 and resumption of Yop expression. Although it is possible that YopH binding is influenced by the truncated catalytic domain, our data suggest that SycH-YscM1 interactions are favored kinetically over the slower forming and less stable SycH-YopH complex. In addition, the propensity to form a complex with SycH was retained by the amino-terminal domain of YscM1. It is conceivable that secretion of YscM1 allows YopH association with SycH (Fig. 4), although ligand exchange may require involvement of an additional factor or perhaps a conformational change. Unlike YopH, YopE is unstable unless bound to the cognate chaperone SycE. Therefore, we could not compare our results with YopH and SycH interactions directly with the analogous YopE-SycE protein-chaperone pair previously reported (25Cheng L.W. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22102-22108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) because the full-length recombinant YopE expressed by E. coli was not soluble. Our results suggest the possibility that YscM1 serves as an intermediate, promiscuous chaperone regulating the release and secretion of YopH and YopE effector proteins into host cells, previously hypothesized to occur sequentially (24Wulff-Strobel C.R. Williams A.W. Straley S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Hence a hierarchical delivery of proteins through the injectosome may be partially controlled by the stability of chaperone-ligand complexes (Fig. 4). In this model, stable complexes of YscM1-SycH are more numerous than YscM1-SycE complexes in turn favoring transfer rates of YopH > YopE. An exchange of SycH with YscM1, which exists as a homodimer (47Wilharm G. Neumayer W. Heesemann J. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 31: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), drives YopH release into the mammalian host cell, and depletion of SycH-YopH complexes initiates the transfer of YopE by a similar mechanism. Further our data indicate that SycE has a propensity to interact with YscM1 and the Y. enterocolitica protein YscM2 but not YopH. It is possible that YscM1, YscM2, and YopH may use similar binding modes due to a high degree of three-dimensional structural similarity among these SycH ligands. 2W. Swietnicki, unpublished results. However, YopE is the natural ligand of the SycE chaperone, and Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis produce YscM1 (LcrQ) but not YscM2. This suggests that YscM2 retained affinity for SycE and SycH during evolution, perhaps serving a function redundant to YscM1.

COX-1 is constitutively expressed in nearly all normal mammalian tissues and mediates the synthesis of PGs required for physiological tissue homeostasis. In contrast, COX-2 expression is rapidly induced in response to various stimuli, including inflammatory signals, mitogens, cytokines, and growth factors in a wide variety of cells such as macrophages, microglia, and astrocytes (3Bauer M.K.

COX-2 has also been in normal brain, in discrete populations of neurons (6Yamagata K. Andreasson K.I. Kaufmann W.E. Barnes C.A. Worley P.F.

Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The function of basal prostanoid production in brain is unclear. As COX-2 expression appears to be up-regulated by physiological synaptic activity, it has been suggested that normal COX-2 expression in neurons may be related to regulation of the sleep/wake cycle, hormone release, and neuronal signaling (6Yamagata K.

The expression of COX-1 and COX-2 has been reported to be associated with complex changes observed during a variety of diseases of the brain. Prostanoids are considered important mediators for various brain functions and have recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia, seizures, and other neural injuries (6Yamagata K.

The regulation and function of COX-2 and prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous system are not completely understood. Polyphenolic compounds in green tea have recently received increasing attention as preventive agents against hippocampal neuronal damage following transient global ischemia, cardiovascular disease and cancer (14Lee S.R Suh S.I Kim S.P. Lett. 2000; 287: 191-194Google Scholar, 15Dufresne C.J. Farnworth E.R. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2001; 12: 404-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 16Yang C.S. Chung J.Y. Yang G. Chhabra S.K.

Green tea polyphenols, which comprise 30% of the dry weight of green tea leaves, include epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), epigallocatechin, epicatechin-3-gallate, and epicatechin. EGCG is the most abundant of these catechins and it has been attributed many healthful benefits. However, a recent study demonstrates that EGCG up-regulates COX-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in Raw 264.7 macrophage cells (18Park J.-W. Choi Y.J. Suh S.-I. Kwon T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting that EGCG may enhance inflammatory processes. However, the downstream effectors linking EGCG stimulation with COX-2 expression and PG production remains unidentified, although the effects of EGCG on COX-2 expression still remain uncertain. Recently, several studies have implicated a PLD-derived signaling pathway in the generation of prostaglandin in many cell types (19Steed P.M. Chow A.H.M. Curr. Pharm. Biotech. 2001; 2: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). PLD catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to generate a lipid mediator, phosphatidic acid (PA) (20Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). PA mediates the biological and physiological functions of PLD either directly or indirectly by its metabolism to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) or diacylglycerol (DAG). In mammals, two isoforms of PLD, PLD1 and PLD2, have been cloned and are being characterized for regulation and cellular function (20Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, segregated roles of the two PLD isoforms in cellular responses are still poorly understood. Activation of PLD occurs through interactions of the ARF and Rho families as well as with protein kinase C (PKC) (20Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The relative contribution of these factors to PLD activation is highly dependent on the cell type and signaling model examined. Several lines of evidence have suggested a functional role for PLD in COX-2 regulation during cell activation (21Sciorra V.A. Daniel L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14226-14232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Angel J. Audubert F. Bismuth G. Fournier C. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5032-5040PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of PLD isozymes in EGCG-induced COX-2 expression has not been studied in any biological system. We therefore investigated a role of PLD in the regulation of COX-2 expression in glial cells treated with EGCG. We selected the normal astrocyte cell and immortalized astroglial cell line (U87) for several reasons. 1) Astrocytes cells are the major cell population in the central nervous system (23O'Banion M.K. Miller J.C. Chang J.W. Kaplan M.D. Coleman P.D. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2532-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and reports using astrocytes cells are lacking. 2Smith W.L. Garavito M.

In this study, we demonstrate that EGCG activates PLD through an upstream protein kinase C to elicit p38 activation and finally induce COX-2 expression in normal rat astrocyte cells and glioma cells. This is the first study to show the involvement of PLD isozymes in mediating EGCG-induced COX-2 expression in any biological system.

A polyclonal antibody that recognizes both PLD1 and PLD2 was generated as previously described (26Min D.S. Ahn B.-H. Rhie D.-J. –H. S. Yoon S.J. Hahn M.-S. Kim Jo Y.H. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylbutanol (PtdBut) standard was from Avanti Polar Lipid. 1-propranolol, 1-butanol, dioctanoyl PA, and anti-β-tubulin antibody were from Sigma, and PD98059, SB203580, and Gö6976 were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). [9, 10-13H]Myristate was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Silica gel 60 A thin layer chromatography plates were from Whatman. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG were from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents and the PGE2 enzyme immunoassay kit were from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Culture and Transfection—U87 MG human astroglioma was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum under 5% CO2. U87 cells were transiently transfected for 40 h with expression plasmid encoding empty vector or a catalytically inactive mutant of p38 MAPK (T180A, Y182F), using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. U87 cells stably overexpressing PLD isozyme were obtained by transfection, using LipofectAMINE. Transfected cells were selected with G418 (700 μg/ml) for 21 days at 37 °C. At that time antibiotic-resistant colonies were pooled and expanded for further analysis under selective conditions. Preparation of Primary Astrocytes and Microglia—Primary astrocytes were cultured from 1–3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as previously described (27Giulian D. Baker T.J. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2163-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Pyo H.K. Ilo J. Chung S.Y. Hong S.M. Joe E.H. NeuroReport. 1998; 9: 871Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The cortices were triturated into single cells in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, Utah), and then plated into 75 cm2 T-flasks (0.5 hemisphere/flask) for 10–14 days. To prepare pure astrocytes, microglia were removed from the T-flasks by mild shaking. The cells remaining in the flasks after removal of the microglia were harvested with 0.1% trypsin and plated into dishes or plates. One hour later, the cells were washed to remove unattached cells before being used in experiments. In Vivo PLD Activity—In vivo PLD activity was determined as described previously (29Ahn B.H. Kim S.Y. Kim E.H. Choi K.S. Kwon T.K. Lee Y.H. Chang J.S. Kim M.S. Jo Y.H. Min D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3103-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). PLD activity was assessed by measuring the formation of [3H]phosphatidylbutanol (PtdBut), the product of PLD-mediated transphosphatidylation, in the presence of 1-butanol. Cells in 6-well plates were serum-starved in the presence of 2 μCi/ml [3H]myristic acid. After overnight starvation, the cells were washed three times with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and pre-equilibrated in serumfree DMEM for 1 h. For the final 10 min of preincubation, 0.3% butan-1-ol was included. At the end of the preincubation, cells were treated with agonists for the indicated times. The extraction and characterization of lipids by thin-layer chromatography were performed as previously described (29Ahn B.H. Kim S.Y. Kim E.H. Choi K.S. Kwon T.K. Lee Y.H. Chang J.S. Kim M.S. Jo Y.H. Min D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3103-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Radioactivity incorporated into total phospholipids was measured, and the results were presented as percentage of total lipid cpm incorporated into phosphatidylbutanol to normalize the results. Western Blot—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in the extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride). The resulting cell lysates were spun at 15,000 × g in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the unbroken cells. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as a standard (4O'Banion M.K. Miller J.C. Chang J.W. Kaplan M.D. Coleman P.D. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2352-2540Google Scholar). Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8% gels and were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were then blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence, resuspended in sample buffer. PGE2 Production Assay—PGE2 levels were determined using an enzyme immunoassay kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, 50 μl of standard or sample was pipetted into the wells of a 96-well plate. Aliquots of mouse polyclonal PGE2 antibody and PGE2 conjugated to alkaline phosphatase were then added to each well, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After incubation, the wells were washed six times with 200 μl of PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and the TMB substrate was added. Wells were read at 670 nm with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader 30 min after adding substrate. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNA was isolated using RNAzol B (TEL-TEST, Inc. Friendwood, TX), and cDNA was prepared using reverse transcriptase that originated from Avian Myeloblastosis Virus (Takara, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed with 30 cycles of sequential reactions as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, and 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Bioneer (Seoul, Korea). The sequence of PCR primers are as follows: The PCR primers for the COX-2 gene were 5′-ACACTCTATCACTGGCATCC-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-GAAGGGACACCCTTTCACAT (antisense primer). 5′-AGATCCACAACGGATACATT-3′ and (forward) 5′-TCCCTCAAGATTGTCAGCAA-3′ for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel and detected under UV light. EGCG Induces COX-2 Expression and PGE2 Production—We investigated whether EGCG, a major compound of green tea, is involved in the signal transduction pathways leading to COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in U87 MG human astroglioma cells. Treatment of the cells with EGCG resulted in significantly increased levels of COX-2 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). The increase in COX-2 expression was apparent 12 h after 50 μm EGCG treatment, reaching a maximal level at 100 μm EGCG. Furthermore, the induction of COX-2 appeared in a time-dependent manner, and 100 μm EGCG treatment showed an increase in COX-2 protein within 6 h, which peaked at 18 h and then sustained up to 24 h after treatment. Because COX-2 catalyzes biosynthesis of PGs, we examined whether this enzyme was responsible for EGCG-induced PGE2 production in the culture media of cells stimulated with EGCG. As shown in Fig. 1B, COX-2 protein expression induced by EGCG was accompanied by an increase in PGE2 accumulation in a dose-dependent manner. The results indicate that EGCG can lead to COX-2 protein expression and subsequently PGE2 biosynthesis in U87 MG human astroglioma cells. PLD Mediates EGCG-induced COX-2 Expression—We next investigated how EGCG-induced COX-2 protein expression is regulated during glioma cell activation. There is also evidence that a PLD-derived signaling pathway is involved in the generation of PGs in several cell types (21Sciorra V.A. Daniel L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14226-14232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Angel J. Audubert F. Bismuth G. Fournier C. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5032-5040PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to address the possible involvement of PLD activation in EGCG-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 biosynthesis, cells prelabeled with [3H]myristate were stimulated with 100 μm EGCG for various times, and PLD activity was measured by the formation of [3H]PtdBut from 1-butanol, a product specific to PLD activity. As shown in Fig. 2, EGCG induced PtdBut formation, in a time-dependent manner. Although the experiments showed that PLD was activated in EGCG-treated human glioma cells, they provided no direct evidence that PLD was involved in the induction of COX-2 expression. A role for PLD in the pathway leading to COX-2 expression received further support when 1-butanol was used to block PA production by PLD, by virtue of the formation of phosphatidylbutanol through the transphosphatidylation reaction. U87 MG cells were stimulated with EGCG in the presence of 1% 1-butanol or 3-butanol. As shown in Fig. 3A, 1-butanol, but not 3-butanol, inhibited EGCG-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 biosynthesis. To confirm that the effect of 1-butanol on COX-2 expression and PGE2 production is caused by the inhibition of PA formation by PLD, we examined COX-2 expression by EGCG in cells pretreated with propranolol, well established PA phosphohydrolase (PAP) inhibitor. Fig. 3B shows that propranolol potentiated EGCG-induced COX-2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. To further establish that PA was involved in the induction of COX-2 expression, cells were treated with various concentrations of dioctanoyl PA. Fig. 4 shows that PA significantly induced COX-2 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that PLD activity and the intracellular accumulation of PA are importantly involved in EGCG-induced COX-2 expression in U87 MG human astroglioma cells.Fig. 3Effect of 1-butanol and 1-propranolol on EGCG-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. A, U87 cells were stimulated with 100 μm EGCG in the presence of 1% 1-butanol or 3-butanol for 6 h. B, cells were treated with EGCG in the presence of indicated concentrations of 1-propranolol for 6 h. The release of PGE2 was measured from supernatants, and the extracted proteins were immunodetected with anti-COX-2 or anti-β-tubulin antibody. The values for PGE2 production are shown as the mean ± S.E., and the COX-2 protein levels are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Phosphatidic acid induces COX-2 expression.

The data shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PKC Is Involved in the COX-2 Protein Expression and PGE2 Formation Induced by EGCG—It has been suggested that PKC is an important regulator of PLD. Moreover, PKC is known to regulate COX-2 expression and PGE2 production by various agonists (19Steed P.M. Chow A.H.M. Curr. Pharm. Biotech. 2001; 2: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Molina-Holgado E. Ortiz S. Molina-Holgado F. Guaza C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Using Western blot analysis and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, we have found that EGCG induces translocation of PKC-α from the cytosol to the membrane (data not shown), which is well documented as a measure of PKC activation. Therefore, we investigated whether EGCG-induced PLD activation and COX-2 expression is regulated by PKC. As shown in Fig. 5, Ca2+-dependent PKC-specific inhibitor, Gö6976, significantly inhibited not only EGCG-induced PLD activation but also EGCG-induced COX-2 expression, and subsequently PGE2 biosynthesis, in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that PKC might be involved in EGCG-induced PLD activation, COX-2 expression, and PGE2 formation. p38 Mediates EGCG-induced PLD Activation, COX-2 Expression, and PGE2 Synthesis—It has been reported that COX-2 expression can be regulated by p38 MAPK or p42/44 MAPK (31Fiebich B.L. Schleicher S. Spleiss O. Czygan M. Hull M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 32Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden B.W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the ability of p38 and p42/44 inhibition to block COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in astroglioma cells. The p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor, SB203580, but not the ERK upstream inhibitor PD98059, dramatically suppressed EGCG-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 biosynthesis (Fig. 6, A and B), suggesting that the p38 kinase signaling pathway may be involved in the EGCG-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. In addition, we found that SB203580, an inhibitor specific for p38, caused a dose-dependent decrease in EGCG-stimulated PLD activity (Fig. 7A). Moreover, expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of p38 MAPK (T180A/Y182F) significantly attenuated EGCG-induced PLD activation in U87 MG cells (Fig. 7B), suggesting that p38 is involved in EGCG-induced PLD activation.Fig. 7Role of p38 in EGCG-induced PLD activation. A, U87 cells were labeled with 2 μCi/ml [3H]myristic acid, treated with the indicated concentrations of SB203580 for 30 min and stimulated with 500 μm EGCG for 30 min. B, U87 cells were transiently transfected for 40 h with expression plasmid encoding empty vector or a catalytically inactive mutant of p38 (T180A, Y182F), using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and labeled with [3H]myristic acid. Cells were left untreated or treated with EGCG (500 μm) for 30 min in the presence of 0.3% 1-butanol. The amount of [3H]PtdBut formed was quantified as described in “Experimental Procedures.” Results are depicted as means ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) EGCG Induces Activation of p38 MAPK via PKC—We next determined whether EGCG activates ERK and p38 MAPK in human astroglioma cells. As shown in Fig. 6C, the phosphorylation of ERK by EGCG peaked at 10 min and decreased thereafter. EGCG stimulation significantly induced activation of p38 MAPK. The phosphorylation of p38 MAPK induced by EGCG peaked at 30 min and then declined. Reprobing the immunoblot with anti-ERK or anti-p38 MAPK antibodies showed the equal loading of proteins in each lane. To examine whether p38-mediated COX-2 expression is exerted via PKC, we stimulated the cells with EGCG in the presence of PKC inhibitors and determined the change of phosphorylation of p38. As shown in Fig. 8, pretreatment with the PKC inhibitor Gö6976 suppressed EGCG-induced p38 phosphorylation, suggesting that EGCG induces activation of p38 via PKC. Both PLD1 and PLD2 Mediate EGCG-induced COX-2 Expression via PKC and p38 MAPK Pathway—To investigate which isozyme of PLD is involved in EGCG-induced COX-2 expression, we generated U87 MG cells stably overexpressing vector, PLD1, or PLD2 (Fig. 9A). In unstimulated cells, overexpression of PLD1 or PLD2 led to higher basal expression of COX-2 protein (Fig. 9B). In EGCG-stimulated cells, overexpression of PLD 1 or 2 dramatically increased COX-2 expression, compared with that of control cells (Fig. 9B), suggesting that overexpression of PLD1 or PLD2 significantly enhances EGCG-induced COX-2 expression. In addition, inhibitors of PKC and p38 MAPK abolished EGCG-induced COX-2 expression in cells overexpressing PLD1 and PLD2 (Fig. 9C). COX-2 expression in PLD1-expressing cells (U87-PLD1) was more sensitive to PKC inhibition than that in PLD2-expressing cells (U87-PLD2). COX-2 expression in both PLD1- and PLD2-expressing cells showed similar response to inhibitor of p38 MAPK. These results suggest that both PLD1 and PLD2 isozymes mediate EGCG-induced COX-2 expression via same pathway, PKC and p38. PLD Also Mediates EGCG-induced COX-2 Expression through PKC and p38 in Primary Astrocyte Cells—U87 cells are transformed glial cells. The relevance of the findings are questionable in that experiments were done in an immortalized astroglial line that may or may not mimic the in vivo situation. Therefore, we tried to ascertain whether treatment with EGCG stimulates COX-2 expression and the same pathways as those obtained in the glioma cells are active in primary astroglial cell cultures. Rat primary astrocytes and microglial cells were stimulated with EGCG or PA for the indicated times, and total RNA was extracted for reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 10, A and B, addition of EGCG rapidly increased the mRNA levels of COX-2 in both primary astrocytes and microglia. Moreover, treatment with PA significantly induced transcription of the COX-2 gene in these cells. Treatment of the primary rat astrocytes with EGCG significantly resulted in increased levels of COX-2 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 10C). These findings demonstrate that EGCG induces the COX-2 in normal glial cells. We next investigated how EGCG-induced COX-2 protein expression is regulated during normal astroglial cell activation. Pretreatment of normal glial cells with 1% 1-butanol caused great inhibition of EGCG-induced COX-2 expression, but the same concentration of 3-butanol, an inactive analogue for PLD-mediated PA formation, had no significant effect (Fig. 11A). Pretreatment propranolol, an inhibitor of PA phosphatase, also stimulated EGCG-induced COX-2 expression (Fig. 11B). These data indicate that EGCG induces COX-2 expression by PLD-mediated pathway in primary astroglial cells. In addition, EGCG stimulated PLD activity and pre"

Here we describe the isolation and characterization of Cx48.5, a zebrafish connexin with the highest sequence identity to mammalian Cx46. Expression analysis showed that Cx48.5 is expressed in the adult and embryonic lens and heart, adult testis, and transiently in the embryonic otic vesicles. Injection of Cx48.5 cRNA into Xenopus oocytes elicited intercellular electrical coupling with voltage sensitivity similar to mammalian Cx46. In single oocytes, Cx48.5 also induced large outward currents on depolarization, consistent with gap-junctional hemichannels. Disruption of Cx48.5 expression in embryos with antisense morpholino oligos (morpholinos) revealed that Cx48.5 has an essential role in the maintenance of lens homeostasis. The morpholino-treated embryos also developed small lenses and eyes as well as severe cardiovascular abnormalities.

The morpholino-treated embryos also developed small lenses and eyes as well as severe cardiovascular abnormalities. Gap junctions are clusters of intercellular channels that allow the propagation of small metabolites, signaling molecules, and electrical impulses between adjacent cells. The protein units that make up the gap junction channels in vertebrates are called connexins and are coded for by a multigene family with 20 or more members in mammals (1Willecke K. Eiberger J. Degen J. Eckardt D. Romualdi A. Guldenagel M. Deutsch U. Sohl G. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Gap junctions play vital roles in the functions of virtually all organs, including the lens and the heart. The evidence to date suggests that distinct sets of connexins may play a role in the development and function of organs like the lens and the heart. Three connexins are expressed in the mammalian lens. Connexin 43 is expressed in the undifferentiated lens epithelium, whereas Cx46 1The abbreviations used are: Cx, connexin; cmlc2, cardiac myosin light chain 2; MF20, myosin heavy chain; dpf, days post-fertilization; eF1α, elongation factor 1α; WMISH, whole mount in situ hybridization; RT, reverse transcriptase.1The abbreviations used are: Cx, connexin; cmlc2, cardiac myosin light chain 2; MF20, myosin heavy chain; dpf, days post-fertilization; eF1α, elongation factor 1α; WMISH, whole mount in situ hybridization; RT, reverse transcriptase. and Cx50 are typically considered lens-specific and are predominantly expressed in the lens fiber cells (for review, see Ref. 2White T.W. Bruzzone R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Both Cx46 and Cx50 knock-out mice developed cataracts (3Gong X. Li E. Klier G. Huang Q.

Four connexins are abundantly expressed in the mammalian heart: Cx43, Cx40, Cx45, and Cx37. Connexin 43 is expressed in the atrial and ventricular working myocardium, Cx40 is found in the atrial working myocardium and the conducting bundle branches and Purkinje fibers, whereas Cx45 is restricted to the atrioventricular conduction system, and Cx37 is restricted to endothelial and endocardial cells (for reviews, see Refs. 6Severs N.J.

Mouse knock-out experiments have demonstrated that Cx43, Cx40, and Cx45 are all essential for cardiac development and function. For instance, connexin 43 knock-out mice died neonatally from pulmonary outflow tract obstruction (9Reaume A.G. de Sousa P.A. Kulkarni S. Langille B.L. Zhu D. Davies T.C. Juneja S.C. Kidder G.M. Rossant J. Science. 1995; 267: 1831-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Connexin 40-deficient mice on the other hand exhibited slowed cardiac conduction and a partial atrioventricular block (10Kirchhoff S. Nelles E. Hagendorff A. Kruger O. Traub O. Willecke K. Curr.

Last, Cx45 knock-out mice died by embryonic day 10 displaying the effects of a conduction block, endocardial cushion defects, and abnormalities of vascular development (12Kruger O. Plum A. Kim J.S.

Suzuki M. Shibata Y. Development. 2000; 127: 3501-3512PubMed Google Scholar). The Cx37 knock-out mice had no apparent cardiovascular abnormalities (14Simon A.M. Goodenough D.A. Li E. Paul D.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Although the expression and function of these four heart connexins have been extensively studied, further evidence suggests other connexins may play a role in heart development and function. For example, despite the fact that Cx45 is the earliest connexin known to be expressed in the heart, cardiac function is initiated normally in Cx45 knock-out mice (13Kumai M. Nishii K. Nakamura K. Takeda N. Suzuki M. Shibata Y. Development. 2000; 127: 3501-3512PubMed Google Scholar). Also, in addition to Cx43, Cx40, Cx45, and Cx37, expression of two other connexins has been reported in the heart. Cx50 was detected in the atrioventricular valves of the rat heart by immunohistochemistry (15Gourdie R.G. Green C.R. Severs N.J. Thompson R.P. Anat. Embryol. 1992; 185: 363-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), whereas Cx46 mRNA was detected in the rat heart by northern blotting (16Paul D.L. Ebihara L. Takemoto L.J. Swenson K.I. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1077-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), and Cx46 protein was detected in the rabbit sinoatrial node by immunohistochemistry (17Verheule S. van Kempen M.J. Postma S. Rook M.B. Jongsma H.J. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 280: 2103-2115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A low amount of Cx46 protein was also found between occasional atrial and ventricular myocytes in the human heart (18Davis L.M. Rodefeld M.E. Green K. Beyer E.C. Saffitz J.E. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 1995; 6: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, no heart defects have been reported in the Cx50 and Cx46 knock-out mice (3Gong X. Li E. Klier G. Huang Q. Wu Y.

Development. 2002; 129: 167-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the function of these two connexins in the heart has remained a mystery. We are using the zebrafish model system to investigate the role of the connexins in vertebrate embryonic development. The zebrafish embryo has unique properties that make it particularly attractive for the study of the cardiovascular and visual systems. The zebrafish cardiovascular system becomes functional by 24 h post-fertilization, but it is not required for the embryo to develop and survive for the first few days (19Lohr J.L. Yost H.J. Am. J.

The zebrafish has a prototypical vertebrate heart composed of four continuous structures (sinus venosus, atrium, ventricle, and bulbus arteriosus) and shares many developmental and physiological similarities to the mammalian heart (22Chen J.N.

Rec. 2000; 260: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 24Hu N. Yost H.J. Clark E.B. Anat. Rec. 2001; 264: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The zebrafish also has unique advantages for visual system study, as the eye is relatively large and develops quickly. The zebrafish optic primordium first appears by 12 h post-fertilization, and functional vision has developed by 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) (25Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8390) Google Scholar, 26Easter S.S.J. Nicola G.N. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 646-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In a recent study (27Cheng S. Christie T. Valdimarsson G. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 228: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) we showed by RT-PCR that Cx48.5, a zebrafish connexin with extensive sequence similarity to mammalian Cx46, is expressed in the adult lens and presented a detailed whole mount in situ hybridization analysis of Cx43, Cx44.1, and Cx48.5 expression in the embryonic lens. In the present study we describe the isolation and further characterization of Cx48.5. We show that in addition to its expression in the embryonic and adult lens it is expressed in the heart (both adult and embryonic), adult testis, and embryonic otic vesicles. In Xenopus oocytes, Cx48.5 forms both gap-junctional intercellular channels and hemichannels with functional properties similar to Cx46 and its orthologues. Gene expression knockdown with Cx48.5 antisense morpholinos resulted in cataract formation as well as the development of both microphakia and microphthalmia and severe cardiovascular abnormalities. Zebrafish Care—Adult zebrafish maintenance, breeding, and embryo collection were according to The Zebrafish Book (28Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1995Google Scholar). The embryos were raised in egg water at 28.5 °C and staged using time elapsed since fertilization. Embryos used for in situ hybridization were treated with 0.003% 1-phenyl-2-thiourea (Sigma, Mississauga, ON, Canada) in egg water beginning at 1 dpf to prevent pigment formation. The protocol for zebrafish use was approved by the University of Manitoba Institutional Animal Care Committee. Screening the Zebrafish PAC Library—A rat Cx46 cDNA probe (16Paul D.L. Ebihara L. Takemoto L.J. Swenson K.I. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1077-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) was used to screen a zebrafish PAC library (RZDP Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum für Genomforschung GmbH, Berlin) at low stringency according to instructions supplied with the library. Two positive PAC clones were digested with PstI and EcoRI and subcloned into the pBluescript II SK +/- vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Subclones were re-screened with the rat Cx46 probe under the same conditions, and one positive subclone from each of the two original PAC clones was sequenced twice. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from adult tissues and whole embryos using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada). Total RNA (2 μg of each sample) was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and a portion of the reverse transcription reaction was used for PCR with Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). For RT-PCR of 4-dpf embryonic hearts and lenses, tissues were dissected with extra fine needles and transferred to 200 μl PCR tubes with micropipettes. The tissues were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then immediately processed for RT-PCR with the Cell-to-cDNA II kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Two embryonic lenses or hearts were used for each sample, and the tissues were lysed in 6 μl of Cell Lysis II buffer. The lysate was split into two parts; 4 μl were used for the reverse transcription, and the remaining 2 μl were used as a negative control (no reverse transcriptase added). The total volume of each reverse transcription reaction was 8 μl; 4 μl of the reaction was used for Cx48.5 PCR, and the other 4 μl was used for PCR with elongation factor 1α (eF1α) control primers. The primers for Cx48.5 were 5′-GCAGACTGTACTTTCTCTCTAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCTTTCTCCTCCTGGAGC-3′ (reverse). The primers for eF1α were 5′-CAAGGGCTCCTTCAAGTACGCCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCAGAATGGCATCAAGGGCA-3′ (reverse). The eF1α primers anneal to exon sequences flanking an intron in the zfeF1α gene. The expected size of the elongation factor amplicon is 569 bp from cDNA and 733 bp from genomic DNA. Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization (WMISH) and Whole Mount Immunohistochemistry—WMISH was carried out as previously described (27Cheng S. Christie T. Valdimarsson G. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 228: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The Cx48.5 probe was 775 bp long extending from 612 nucleotides downstream of the start codon to 81 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon, and the cardiac myosin light chain 2 (cmlc2) probe (a generous gift from Dr. Didier Stainier) was about a 1-kb-long fragment from the 3′ end of the cmlc2 cDNA (29Yelon D. Horne S.A. Stainier D.Y. Dev. Biol. 1999; 214: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The alkaline phosphatase color reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 and 2 h for the Cx48.5 and the cmlc2 probes, respectively. WMISH embryos were imaged on a Leica MZ8 stereomicroscope. Whole mount immunohistochemistry with the myosin heavy chain (MF20) monoclonal antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA) was carried out according to the whole mount staining protocol in The Zebrafish Book (28Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1995Google Scholar). The secondary antibody used was a goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with Alexa Fluor 546 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The fluorescence images were collected on the Zeiss Axioskop FS microscope equipped with a rhodamine filter set. All images were captured with a SONY DXC-950 CCD color video camera and Northern Eclipse software (Empix, Mississauga, ON). Functional Analysis in Xenopus Oocytes—The Cx48.5-coding sequence was subcloned into pCS2+ (30Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar), linearized with NotI, gel-purified, and used as the template (1 μg of DNA) to produce capped cRNAs using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion). Stage V-VI oocytes were isolated from Xenopus laevis (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI), defolliculated by collagenase digestion, and cultured in modified Barth's medium. Cells were injected with a total volume of 40 nl of either an antisense oligonucleotide (3 ng/cell) to suppress endogenous Xenopus Cx38 or a mixture of antisense plus Cx48.5 cRNA (40 ng/cell) using a Nanoject II Auto/Oocyte injector (Drummond, Broomall, PA). After overnight incubation, oocytes were immersed for a few minutes in hypertonic solution to strip the vitelline envelope, transferred to Petri dishes containing modified Barth's medium supplemented to a final Ca2+ concentration of 2.9 mm (31White T.W. Bruzzone R. Wolfram S. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 879-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and manually paired with the vegetal poles apposed. Electrophysiological recordings were made 24-48 h after pairing. The functional properties of cell-to-cell channels were assessed by dual voltage clamp (32Spray D.C. Harris A.L. Bennett M.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 77: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Current and voltage electrodes (1.2-mm diameter, omega dot; Glass Company of America, Millville, NJ) were pulled to a resistance of 1-2 megaohms with a horizontal puller (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) and filled with 3 m KCl, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Voltage clamping of oocyte pairs was performed using two GeneClamp 500 amplifiers (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) controlled by a PC-compatible computer through a Digidata 1320A interface (Axon Instruments). pCLAMP 8.0 software (Axon Instruments) was used to program stimulus and data collection paradigms. Current outputs were filtered at 50 Hz, and the sampling interval was 10 ms. For simple measurements of junctional conductance, both cells of a pair were initially clamped at -40 mV to ensure zero transjunctional potential, and alternating pulses of ±20 mV were imposed to one cell. Current delivered to the cell clamped at -40 mV during the voltage pulse was equal in magnitude to the junctional current and was divided by the voltage to yield the conductance. To determine voltage-gating properties, transjunctional potentials (Vj) of opposite polarity were generated by hyperpolarizing or depolarizing one cell in 20-mV steps (over a range of ±120 mV) while clamping the second cell at -40 mV. Currents were measured at the end of the voltage pulse, at which time they approached steady state (Ijss), and the macroscopic conductance (Gjss) was calculated by dividing Ijss by Vj. Gjss was then normalized to the values determined at ±20 mV and plotted against Vj. Data describing the relationship of Gjss as a function of Vj were analyzed using Origin 6.0 (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA) and fit to a Boltzmann relation of the form,Gjss={(Gjmax−Gjmin)/1+exp[A(Vj−V0)]}+Gjmin(Eq. 1) where Gjss is the steady-state junctional conductance, Gjmax (normalized to unity) is the maximum conductance, Gjmin is the residual conductance at large values of Vj, and V0 is the transjunctional voltage at which Gjss = (Gjmax - Gjmin)/2. The constant A (=nq/kT) represents the voltage sensitivity as the equivalent number (n) of electron charges (q) moving through the membrane; k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is absolute temperature. To characterize non-junctional hemichannels, single oocytes were assessed with a two-electrode voltage-clamp procedure (33Ebihara L. Steiner E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Cells were initially clamped at -40 mV. Depolarizing voltage steps (-30 to +60 mV at 10-mV intervals) were imposed for a duration of 4.5 s, and whole-cell currents were recorded. Mean current values were measured at the end of the pulse and plotted against the membrane potential. Microinjection of Morpholino Oligos—Cx48.5 antisense and control morpholinos were obtained from Gene Tools, LLC (Philomath, OR). Two non-overlapping antisense morpholinos were used. Both were targeted against non-coding sequences in the 5′-untranslated region. The targeted sequences were 5′-GCTTCACGATTTCTAGCCTAGAGAG-3′ and 5′-AACAGAGAGGATTCATTGAGAACTA-3′. The standard control morpholino sequence was 5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′. Morpholino stock solutions were prepared according to Nasevicius and Ekker (34Nasevicius A. Ekker S.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar), and the working solution was 1 ng/nl. 1-cell-stage zebrafish embryos were orientated in a holding chamber prepared according to The Zebrafish Book (28Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1995Google Scholar) and microinjected with a Narishige Pressure Microinjection System (Carsen Medical and Scientific Co. Ltd.) on a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope. Injections with a series of volumes ranging from 0.5 to 5 nl were carried out with individual morpholinos and a combination of both morpholinos. For the phenotypic analysis presented in this manuscript embryos were injected with a combination of 1 ng of each antisense morpholino or 2 ng of the control morpholino. Morphological Analyses—For histological analysis the embryos were embedded in JB-4 (Polysciences, Warrington, PA), sectioned at 3 μm, stained with toluidine blue (1% in aqueous 1% borax), and imaged with a Zeiss Axioskop FS microscope. Observations of live embryos were performed with differential interference contrast optics on a Zeiss Axioskop FS microscope, and dark field observations of dissected lenses were performed with a Leica MZ8 stereomicroscope. All images were acquired with a SONY DXC-950 CCD color video camera and Northern Eclipse Software. Growth and Heart Rate Measurements—For the measurements of the lens, eye, body length, and otic vesicles, embryos were anesthetized according to The Zebrafish Book (28Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1995Google Scholar) and then placed in a viewing chamber constructed of a microscope slide and a supported cover glass. The space between the slide and the cover glass was about 1 mm, so that the zebrafish embryos were almost parallel to the slide. Images of lenses, eyes, and otic vesicles were collected as described above and measured with the Northern Eclipse Software. Body lengths were measured by putting the slides against a ruler on a Leica MZ8 stereomicroscope. For the measurements of heart rates, the embryos were placed in 24-well plates and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature (24 °C). The plates were then placed on a Leica MZ8 stereomicroscope, and the heart rates were counted. The embryos destined for heart rate measurements were not anesthetized because this seemed to raise variation in the heart rate. Statistical comparisons were made between control and antisense-injected embryos using an univariate analysis of variance followed by the Tamhane's T2 test. The default α level was 0.05 unless otherwise specified. Online Supplemental Material—Supplemental video material is available online. The videos show the heart beat in a 1.5-dpf Cx48.5 morphant embryo (Movie 1) and a 1.5-dpf control embryo (Movie 2). The trunk circulation in a 1.5-dpf Cx48.5 morphant embryo (Movie 3), and a control embryo (Movie 4) is also shown. The movies were collected at 33 frames/s and played at 15 the original speed. Isolation of the Zebrafish Cx48.5 Gene—We are using comparative gene function analysis in our continued effort to understand the role of specific connexins in the development and function of the vertebrate ocular lens. We previously reported the cloning and characterization of Cx44.1, a zebrafish connexin with extensive sequence and biophysical similarities to rodent and human Cx50 (35Cason N. White T.W. Cheng S. Goodenough D.A. Valdimarsson G. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 221: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and here we report the isolation and functional characterization of Cx48.5, a zebrafish connexin with extensive sequence and biophysical similarities to rodent and human Cx46. The isolated genomic sequence contains a coding region of 1305 nucleotides within one single exon, coding for 434 amino acids. The protein has a predicted molecular mass of 48,492 Da and is, therefore, named Cx48.5. Sequence comparisons showed that Cx48.5 has the highest degree of amino acid identity to the Cx46 orthologous group of connexins (61% amino acid identity to mouse Cx46). The amino acid sequence of Cx48.5 is consistent with the typical structure of a connexin (36Unger V.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Yeager M. Science. 1999; 283: 1176-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 37Yeager M. Unger V.M. Falk M.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), with four transmembrane segments, a cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane segments 2 and 3, cytoplasmic amino and carboxyl termini, and two extracellular loops with three conserved cysteines in each. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of Cx48.5, mouse Cx46, and chicken Cx56 (Fig. 1) demonstrated conservation in the location of the six extracellular loop cysteines and the two amino acids that have been shown to be mutated in human Cx46-linked congenital cataracts (Asn-63 and Pro-187) (38Mackay D. Ionides A. Kibar Z. Rouleau G. Berry V. Moore A. Shiels A. Bhattacharya S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 39Rees M.I. Watts P. Fenton I. Clarke A. Snell R.G. Owen M.J. Gray J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 106: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Analysis of the amino acid composition of Cx48.5 revealed that this connexin has a low isoelectric point (pI 5.64) and contains a high proportion of glutamic acid (9.4%). Most members of the Cx46 orthologous group (mouse, sheep, cow, chicken) have a significantly higher pI (7.04-9.85) and much lower proportion of glutamic acid (5.2-6.7%). In contrast to this, most members of the Cx50 orthologous group (human, mouse, sheep, chicken, zebrafish) have low pI (5.01-5.44) and a much higher content of glutamic acid (10.0-13.2%). With respect to pI and glutamic acid content, Cx48.5 therefore resembles the Cx50 orthologous group more closely than the Cx46 orthologous group despite the fact that the overall amino acid comparisons indicated that Cx48.5 is more similar to the Cx46 group than the Cx50 group. Cx48.5 mRNA Expression in Embryos and Adult Tissues—RT-PCR was performed with RNA samples isolated from adult tissues, whole embryos, and embryonic hearts and lenses. Cx48.5 transcripts were not detected in 8-h post-fertilization whole embryo RNA but were readily detected at 1 dpf and at later stages (Fig. 2A). In adult tissues Cx48.5 transcripts were detected in the lens and heart, and weak RT-PCR product was also amplified from testis mRNA. Cx48.5 mRNA was not found in the adult liver, ovary, brain, or retina. We also detected Cx48.5 transcripts in RNA isolated from 4 dpf embryonic hearts and lenses (Fig. 2B), but we were not successful in obtaining enough heart material to carry out the analysis at earlier stages due to the fragility of the tissue. Zebrafish eF1α primers were used to show that comparable amounts of cDNA were included in each reaction and to show the absence of genomic DNA contamination from all the samples. The eF1α primers span an intron and produce a PCR product of smaller size from cDNA than genomic DNA (569 versus 733 bp) (Fig. 2, A and B). WMISH was performed with embryos from 1-4 dpf. A strong signal was detected in the otic vesicles in 1 dpf embryos (Fig. 2, C and D). The otic vesicle expression appeared to be transient since it was not detected at any of the later stages (1.5-4 dpf). In contrast to the signal in the otic vesicles, expression of Cx48.5 in the lens was not detected at 1 dpf (Fig. 2C). Instead, strong expression of Cx48.5 in the lens was observed at 1.5 dpf (Fig. 2, E and F) and later stages. We did not detect Cx48.5 expression in the heart or any other organs by WMISH, probably because of insufficient sensitivity of the method. Cx48.5 Forms Voltage-sensitive Intercellular Channels—To determine whether Cx48.5 could form junctional channels, we used the paired Xenopus oocyte expression system (40Dahl G. Miller T. Paul D. Voellmy R. Werner R. Science. 1987; 236: 1290-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Oocytes had resting potentials ranging between -40 and -50 mV and were clamped at -40 mV for measurements of junctional conductance. As shown in Fig. 3A, Cx48.5 induced the development of high levels of electrical coupling 24-48 h after RNA injection. The mean conductance (Gj) of paired Cx48.5-injected cells was 53.7 ± 22.2 microsiemens (mean ± S.D., n = 41). In contrast, the mean background conductance value, measured between oligo-injected control oocytes, was more than 200-fold lower at 0.15 ± 0.18 microsiemens (n = 36). Thus, the expression of Cx48.5 resulted in the formation of functional gap junction channels. To further characterize the physiological behavior of channels composed of Cx48.5, we analyzed their voltage dependence. A representative family of junctional currents (Ij) evoked by voltage steps of opposite polarities and increasing amplitude (Fig. 3B) shows that Ij decreased in a time- and voltage-dependent manner for transjunctional voltages >40 mV. The rate of channel closure, calculated for Vjs of ± 80 mV, yielded a time constant (τ) on the order of 0.3 s, a value intermediate between the slower channels like Cx26 and Cx32 and the more rapidly gating channels such as Cx37 or Cx40 (41Barrio L.C.

In eukaryotic translation initiation, a ternary complex consisting of Met-tRNAi, GTP, and the heterotrimeric initiation factor eIF2 (6Kimball S.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 7Merrick W.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) associates with the 40 S ribosomal subunit together with other initiation factors to form the 43 S preinitiation complex. This complex binds close to the 5′-end of mRNA and scans it in the 5′-to3′-direction to localize the AUG initiation codon. AUG recognition is mediated by codon-anticodon interaction and involves GTP hydrolysis stimulated by eIF5. This is a prerequisite for the 80 S initiation complex formation, i.e. the joining of the large ribosomal subunit and the release of initiation factors bound to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. After its release, the eIF2-GDP complex is bound by eIF2B, which catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP. The recycling of eIF2 is modulated by posttranslational modifications of eIF2B (8Wang X.

Cell. 1977; 11: 187-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated eIF2 binds 150 times more strongly to eIF2B than the non-phosphorylated form and therefore acts as a competitive inhibitor in the nucleotide exchange reaction, which consequently leads to inhibition of translation initiation (12Dever T.E. Yang W. Astrom S. Bystrom A.S. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6351-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Besides the well characterized eIF2B subunits, the PF01008 family contains a subfamily of proteins (eIF2_rel) of mainly unknown function in eukaryotes, archaeae (e.g. Pyrococcus furiosus), or eubacteria such as Bacillus subtilis and Thermotoga maritima. Many of these proteins were initially annotated as putative translation initiation factors despite the fact that there is no evidence for the requirement of an IF2 recycling factor in prokaryotic translation initiation. Recently, one of these proteins from B. subtilis, Swiss-Prot entry MTNA_BACSU, has been functionally characterized as a 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate isomerase (MTNA) (13Ashida H. Saito Y. Kojima C.

This enzyme participates in the methionine salvage pathway catalyzing the isomerization of 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate to 5-methylthioribulose-1-phosphate (14Sekowska A. Danchin A. BMC Microbiol. 2002; 2: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The methionine salvage pathway leads to the synthesis of methionine from methylthioadenosin (see Fig. 2A for a scheme), the end product of the spermidine and spermine anabolism in many species including mammals (15Riscoe M.K. Ferro A.J. Fitchen J.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1988; 32: 1904-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), Trypanosoma brucei (15Riscoe M.K. Ferro A.J. Fitchen J.H. Antimicrob.

Chem. 2003; 278: 49868-49873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), Klebsiella pneumoniae (17Furfine E.S. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9598-9606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and B. subtilis (14Sekowska A. Danchin A. BMC Microbiol. 2002; 2: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The methionine salvage pathway has attracted much attention due to the finding that methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, the first enzyme in the pathway, is deleted in a variety of human tumors (15Riscoe M.K. Ferro A.J. Fitchen J.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1988; 32: 1904-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and acts as a tumor suppressor gene (18Christopher S.A. Diegelman P. Porter C.W. Kruger W.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6639-6644PubMed Google Scholar). This was attributed to the fact that products of the methionine salvage pathway regulate polyamine biosynthesis by inhibiting the activity of ornithine decarboxylase, an enzyme found to be up-regulated in a variety of human and animal tumors (19Auvinen M. Paasinen A. Andersson L.C. Holtta E. Nature. 1992; 360: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the methionine salvage pathway is a target for antimalarian drugs as Plasmodium falciparum was shown to harbor a 5-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, which is inhibited by methylthioadenosine analogs in μm concentrations leading to growth inhibition (20Sufrin J.R. Meshnick S.R. Spiess A.J. Garofalo-Hannan J. Pan X.Q. Bacchi C.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2511-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Ypr118w shares 37% sequence identity with the established 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate isomerase from B. subtilis and 26-28% identity with the well characterized eIF2B α-subunits from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and S. cerevisiae. These findings raise the question of whether Ypr118w is a 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate isomerase or a translation initiation factor. We solved the crystal structure of Ypr118w and present genetic evidence showing that Ypr118w is the yeast S. cerevisiae 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate isomerase. Yeast Strain—Yeast BY4741 wild type and derivative strain Δypr118::kanXR (Euroscarf collection) were used. The genotype of these strains is: MATa Δhis3 Δleu2 Δmet15 Δura3. Plasmid Construct—The YPR118w open reading frame was PCR-amplified from the start ATG to the stop codon from total yeast genomic DNA using primers to introduce a 5′-SmaI and a 3′-SacI site and subcloned into the multiple cloning site of yeast shuttle vector p301HIS3 under the control of the GAL1/10 promoter, resulting in the construct p301HIS3-YPR118. Cell Growth on MTA—Yeast cells were transformed with p301HIS3-YPR118 or p301HIS3 vector (negative control). Precultures of transformed cells were grown in synthetic defined minimal medium with 2% glucose (SD) or synthetic defined minimal medium with 2% galactose (SDGal) in the presence of all auxotrophic markers. Cells were washed with water and used to inoculate SD or SDGal cultures containing leucine, uracil, and methionine (all at 20 μg/ml) or 5 mm methylthioadenosine (MTA). Growth was monitored by measuring the cell density (A600) after 40 h of incubation at 30 °C. Protein Expression and Purification—DNA encoding full-length YPR118W was amplified by PCR from total yeast genomic DNA using primers designed to introduce a 5′-SalI site and a 3′-NotI site. The PCR product was digested and inserted into pGEX-6P3 (Amersham Biosciences) expression vector. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was expressed in BL21-CodonPlus™(DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene). Cells were grown to an A600 of 0.9 in minimal medium at 37 °C, and expression was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After a 3-h induction, cells were harvested and resuspended in Tris-buffered saline (100 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and disrupted using a French press. After centrifugation, batch purification of GST-Ypr118w was performed by incubating the extract with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer followed by three washes with Tris-buffered saline. The protein was eluted from the beads using reduced glutathione, and the GST moiety was cleaved with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 16 h. The protein was purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The protein fraction was pooled, reincubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, and loaded onto a 1-ml Resource Q™ column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Bound protein was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0-0.5 m) in the same buffer. All purification steps were monitored by SDS-PAGE analysis (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The protein was desalted by ultrafiltration using a Centriprep-10 (Millipore) with 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and concentrated to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. Mass spectrometric analysis was carried out by the Analytical Research Services of the Chemistry Department, University of Berne. Selenomethionine-labeled protein was prepared by the method of methionine biosynthesis inhibition (22Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar) and purified following the same protocol as for wild-type protein. Crystallization—Crystals of Ypr118w and selenomethionine-Ypr118w were obtained within 4 days by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. Drops were set up by mixing 2 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml) with 2 μl of reservoir solution (200 mm ammonium sulfate, 25% polyethylene glycol 3350, Bis-Tris, pH 5.5) and equilibrated against 120 μl of reservoir solution at 291 K. Typical crystals were needle-shaped with an average size of 30 × 30 × 300 μm3. They belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with cell parameters of a = 60.7 Å, b = 105.6 Å, c = 263.3 Å and contain four monomers/asymmetric unit. Data Collection—Before data collection, crystals were flash-cooled in a nitrogen stream at 110 K after raising the glycerol concentration of the crystallization solution to 15% (v/v). Data were collected in a MAD experiment on beamline BW7A at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) Hamburg Outstation at the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY) at 100 K, employing a MAR-165 CCD (MAR X-ray-Research GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) detector. A second MAD experiment was performed at the Grenoble European Synchrotron Radiation Facility MAD beamline BM14 at 100 K, employing a Mosaic 225 CCD (MAR X-ray-Research GmbH) detector. Due to the alignment of the crystals, only 0.2°/frame could be collected. Exposure times varied from about 30 s (Hamburg) to about 5 s (Grenoble). All data sets were integrated and scaled with XDS (23Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 22: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1681) Google Scholar, 24Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). Structure Solution, Refinement, and Analysis—The structure was solved by MAD using selenomethionine-labeled protein. The Hamburg as well as the Grenoble MAD data sets were sufficient to solve the structure, both yielding clean electron density maps. However, the Grenoble data set extended to higher resolution due to the brighter beam and larger detector and was therefore later used to obtain an experimental density map suitable for automated model building. Sixteen out of twenty expected selenium positions were determined by SHELXD (25Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). Phases were computed using SOLVE (26Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Comparison of three-dimensional structures was effected using DALI (33Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3545) Google Scholar). Structure figures were created using the program PYMOL (www.pymol.org). Ypr118w Is a 5-Methylthioribose-1-phosphate Isomerase—The sequence similarity between Ypr118w and 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate isomerase from B. subtilis led us to test whether Ypr118w is involved in the methionine salvage pathway. In this pathway, MTA, a byproduct of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway, is recycled in cells by reconversion to methionine. This requires several enzymatic steps. The first step is the conversion of MTA to 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate (MTR) by MTA phosphorylase followed by its isomerization to methylthioribulose-1-P (Fig. 2A). Recent studies led to the identification of some genes involved in the methionine salvage pathway in S. cerevisiae. Among those, Meu1 was identified as encoding the enzyme MTA phosphorylase (16Subhi A.L. Diegelman P. Porter C.W. Tang B. Lu Z.J. Markham G.D. Kruger W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49868-49873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas the gene encoding the MTR isomerase could so far not be identified. To find out whether Ypr118w is the MTR isomerase, we tested whether a Δypr118w knock-out yeast strain auxotrophic for methionine was able to grow in a synthetic medium lacking methionine when supplemented with MTA. As opposed to the isogenic wild-type strain BY4741 (not shown), the Δypr118 knock-out strain was not able to grow on MTA, neither in the presence of glucose nor in the presence of galactose (2%) as carbon source, but it grew well in the presence of methionine (Fig. 2B). We then transformed the Δypr118 knock-out strain with a plasmid carrying the gene YPR118W under the control of the galactose-inducible GAL1/10 promoter. Cells transformed with this construct (but not with the control vector) were able to grow on MTA in the presence of galactose (Fig. 2B) but not in the presence of glucose, clearly demonstrating that expression of Ypr118w was required to convert MTA into methionine. This indicates that YPR118W encodes for an enzyme of the methionine salvage pathway. We also wanted to prove directly the isomerization of methylthioribose-1-phosphate to methylthioribulose-1-phosphate by Ypr118w. As methylthioribose-1-phosphate is not commercially available, we performed a two-step enzymatic reaction using recombinant Meu1p and 5-thiomethyladenosine to produce methylthioribose-1-phosphate. In a second step, Ypr118w was added to the reaction mixture. We could readily detect the formation of a compound that was positive in an assay for reducing sugars (34Avigad G. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 41: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The NMR spectra of the expected compounds 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate and 5-methylthioribulose-1-phsophate were identified (17Furfine E.S. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9598-9606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the coupled reaction leading to 5-methylthioribulose-1-phosphate was not very efficient (not shown). Monomer Structure—The current model contains residues 1-407 without the amino acids 212-220, which are located in a disordered surface loop in all four monomers. This segment contains a unique and large insertion in the PF01008 family. The four crystallographically independent monomers do not show any significant deviation from each other; the root mean square deviation of the Cα-positions is about 0.3 Å, whereas single exposed surface residues show deviations of up to 1.4 Å. The Ypr118w monomer structure has dimensions of 55 × 55 × 73 Å and can be formally divided into two domains (Fig. 3A). The N-terminal 138 amino acids fold into a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet followed by 6 α-helices with helices 1, 2, 4, and 5 building the core of this domain. Helix 5 is 38 amino acids long and bridges the N- and C-terminal domains. This helix is kinked in the middle by about 15°. The pollen allergen phl p 6 (PDB entry 1NLX) and the ATP synthase subunit C (PDB entry 1C17) were identified as the closest structural homologs of the N-terminal domain with a DALI Z-score of 5.0, where 77 or 91 amino acids were aligned with a root mean square deviation of 3.2 and 4.5 Å, respectively. The C-terminal domain possesses an αβα-fold resembling ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RpiA) from Escherichia coli (PDB entry 1LKZ, DALI Z-score 11.6, 158 amino acids aligned with a root mean square deviation of 3.2 Å) (35Rangarajan E.S. Sivaraman J. Matte A. Cygler M. Proteins. 2002; 48: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and glutaconate coenzyme A-transferase from Acidaminococcus fermentans (PDB entry 1POI, DALI-score 8.4) (36Jacob U. Mack M. Clausen T. Huber R. Buckel W. Messerschmidt A. Structure. 1997; 5: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This domain contains a central six-stranded, mostly parallel, β-sheet surrounded by four α-helices and the C-terminal part of helix 6. The core resembles the well known Rossman-type fold with three βαβ-units. An “arm,” consisting of residues 341-367, wraps around the molecule with a short α-helix and two β-strands connected by a loop forming the tip (“hand”) of this segment (residues 338-372). This arm is rather unique in the whole family PF01008. Ypr118w Is a Dimer—Gel filtration experiments indicate that Ypr118w is a dimer in solution (not shown). This was further corroborated by the crystal structure: the asymmetric unit contains two dimers, which are identical despite rather different crystal contacts. A total of 5,379 Å2 (30%) of accessible surface gets buried upon dimer formation, a surface much larger than a usual crystal contact. The dimer has a “butterfly” shape (Fig. 3B). The interactions between the monomers are mediated by the C-terminal domains, especially via the arm and hand and neighboring segments (residues 335-383). Residues 231-260 including helices 7 and 8 also contribute to the interface. Putative Active Site—A sulfate ion originating from the crystallization solution is deeply bound inside the cleft between the N- and C-terminal domains. It is coordinated via hydrogen bonds to the side chains of Arg51, Arg106, Gln237, and Lys291 (Fig. 4). The side chain of Arg51 is anchored via hydrogen bonds to the main chain carbonyl oxygen and to the side chain of Asn182. These amino acids are highly, although not absolutely, conserved. They vary, especially in the case of bona fide translation initiation factors, which supports the hypothesis that Ypr118w has a function different from translation initiation. The sulfate ion is located solvent-inaccessible deeply inside the protein in a rather large cavity (volume 110 Å3). We interpret the observation of such a tightly bound sulfate ion in all four crystallographically independent monomers as a putative substrate binding site, where a phosphate would occupy the position of the sulfate, as has been observed frequently. The cavity surrounding the sulfate binding site is in principle large enough to harbor a phosphorylated sugar molecule. Interestingly, after superposition, the putative phosphate binding site is close to the active center of RpiA (Fig. 5), which further supports the hypothesis that these enzymes have evolved from a common ancestor.Fig. 5Overlay of RpiA from E. coli (cyan, PDB code 1OB8) and Ypr118w (orange). The structures were superimposed using the program LSQMAN (43Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 525-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar).

Nearly all of them are located close to the putative active site assigned to the sulfate binding cavity (Figs. 1, 3B, and 4). Motif 1 includes amino acids 45-59. Arg51 is located at the start of helix 2 and probably binds to the phosphate moiety of the substrate. Motif 2, which is located mainly in the turn between helix 3 and helix 4, comprises residues 104-112. Again, Arg106 is likely to be involved in binding to a phosphate moiety. Motif 3 includes amino acids 177-189 and possesses a cysteine (Cys181) that is absolutely conserved in the MNTA (eIF2_rel) subfamily of PF01008 but is absent in eukaryotic e"

Proteolytic processing of caspases is observed during apoptosis, and this correlates with conversion of inactive caspase proenzymes into their active two-chain forms. However, recent studies have suggested that caspase-8 is activated through dimerization and that interchain proteolysis is not sufficient for activation of this caspase. This proposal casts doubt upon whether caspase-8 is productively activated by granzyme B during granule-dependent cytotoxic T lymphocyte or natural killer cell-mediated killing, for example. Contrary to the dimerization model, we show that direct proteolysis of caspase-8 by the cytotoxic T lymphocyte protease granzyme B, or by caspase-6, produces an active enzyme that displays robust proteolytic activity toward synthetic as well as natural caspase-8 substrates. These data suggest that enforced dimerization of caspase-8 zymogens by scaffold proteins such as Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), although important in certain contexts, is not a prerequisite for activation of this protease.

The caspase family of cysteine proteases plays a central role in apoptosis through controlled demolition of the cellular architecture in response to diverse stimuli (1Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 2Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev.

During apoptosis, restricted proteolysis of an array of caspase substrates results in the morphological and biochemical alterations characteristic of this mode of cell death (4Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7320-7326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 5Fischer U. Janicke R.U. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 76-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Caspases are normally present as dormant proenzymes in viable cells and achieve catalytic competence at the onset of apoptosis. Although a common subset of caspases becomes activated in essentially all forms of apoptosis, caspase activation is achieved in stimulus-specific ways. Certain caspases, such as caspases-8 and -9, possess long N-terminal pro-domains that are used to recruit these enzymes to activation complexes. Caspase activation complexes are typically assembled at the onset of apoptosis and promote activation of caspases recruited to these complexes (6Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Caspases that are activated in this way (termed initiator caspases) can then further propagate death signals by proteolytically processing downstream caspases, such as caspases-3, -6, and -7, within the cell. Caspase-8 acts as the initiator caspase in cell death pathways that result from ligand-driven engagement of certain members of the tumor necrosis factor/nerve growth factor receptor family (7Boldin M.P.

In this context, the adaptor molecule FADD 1The abbreviations used are: FADD, Fas-associated protein with death domain; AFC, amino-4[trifluoromethyl]-coumaride; CEB, cell extract buffer; cmk, chloromethyl ketone; Cyt c, cytochrome c; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; mAb, monoclonal antibody. recruits caspase-8 to plasma membrane-associated receptor complexes and promotes activation of this caspase. Receptor-driven clustering of caspase-8 is thought to activate the enzyme through facilitating autoproteolysis of full-length caspase-8 molecules to produce a two-chain active enzyme. However, recent studies have proposed the alternative view that caspase-8 aggregation serves primarily to facilitate dimerization of the enzyme and that this is sufficient for activation (9Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol.

In this model, dimerization, rather than interchain proteolysis, is the critical requirement for caspase activation, and subsequent autoprocessing of the enzyme has been proposed to act merely to stabilize caspase-8 dimers (9Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). A corollary of this model is that direct proteolytic processing of caspase-8, by other caspases or proteases with similar specificity such as granzyme B, in the absence of a dimerization platform may not be sufficient for activation for this caspase. Interchain processing of caspases is observed in most, if not all, forms of apoptosis and has become widely accepted as a hallmark of caspase activation. If correct, the dimerization model suggests that the appearance of proteolytically processed forms of caspase-8 is not a reliable measure of the activation status of this protease. Interchain proteolysis of caspase-8 is observed in at least two important contexts where a stimulus for dimerization is not apparent. In the context of cytotoxic T lymphocyte/natural killer-mediated killing, caspase-8 is processed directly by the granule protease granzyme B, and this has previously been assumed to correlate with activation of this protease (11Fernandes-Alnemri T.

Furthermore, in the stress-initiated/apoptosome pathway to apoptosis, caspase-8 becomes proteolytically processed via direct proteolysis by caspase-6 (4Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7320-7326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 13Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C.

Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1046-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The dimerization model of caspase-8 activation predicts that caspase-8 processing in the aforementioned contexts will result in catalytically inactive protease. Here, we have tested this prediction, and, contrary to the dimerization model, we find that interchain processing is sufficient to produce catalytically active caspase-8. Materials—The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting and/or immunoprecipitation: mouse anti-caspase-3 (BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-caspase-3 D175 (Cell Signaling Technology, UK), mouse anti-caspase-8 (clone C15; Apotech), mouse anti-caspase-8 (clone 12F5; Apotech), mouse anti-caspase-8 (clone 1C12; Cell Signaling Technology), and mouse anti-caspase-8 (clone 5F7; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Anti-Fas IgM (clone CH-11) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology and was used to initiate apoptosis by adding it to cell culture medium at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. Biotin-VAD-fmk (biotin-Val-Ala-Asp-[Ome]-fluoromethyl ketone) was purchased from ICN. Biotin-YVAD-cmk (biotinyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethyl ketone) was purchased from Bachem, and the caspase-8 synthetic substrate Ac-IETD-AFC (Ac-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-7-amino-4[trifluoromethyl]-coumaride) was purchased from ICN. Preparation of Cell-free Extracts—Cell-free cytosolic S-15 extracts were generated from Jurkat cells as described previously (4Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7320-7326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 15Murphy B.M. O'Neill A.J. Adrain C. Watson R.W.G. Martin S.J. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 108 cells were packed into a 2 ml of Dounce homogenizer, and an equal volume of ice-cold cell extract buffer was added (CEB: 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were allowed to swell in CEB for 20–30 min on ice and were then lysed by homogenization with ∼15–20 strokes of a B-type pestle. Crude extracts were then centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 × g to remove nuclei, unbroken cells, and other debris. Extracts (25–30 mg/ml protein) were stored in aliquots at –70 °C until required. Initiation of Caspase-8 Proteolytic Processing—Caspase-8 processing was initiated in Jurkat cell-free extracts by the addition of 50 μg/ml bovine heart cytochrome c (Cyt c) and 1 mm dATP, which triggers assembly of Apaf-1/caspase-9 apoptosomes, followed by incubation of cell-free reactions for 2 h at 37 °C (4Slee E.A.

Martin S.J. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Alternatively, 100 nm purified human granzyme B (Calbiochem) was added to cell-free extracts followed by incubation as described above. Fas/CD95-driven caspase-8 processing was initiated in Jurkat cells by stimulation with 100 ng/ml anti-Fas IgM for 4 h at 37 °C. Caspase-8 Immunoprecipitation and Assessment of Catalytic Activity—Caspase-8 was immunoprecipitated from cell-free reactions using various monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as detailed above. Briefly, at appropriate time points cell-free reactions (50–100 μl/immunoprecipitation) were diluted to 250 μl with CEB followed by the addition of 1–2 μg of anti-caspase-8 mAbs and 40 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz). Immunoprecipitations were rotated for 4 h at 4 °C followed by pelleting of immunocomplexes and washing three times in CEB (1 ml/wash). For synthetic peptide hydrolysis assays, protein A/G-agarose-immobilized caspase-8 complexes were resuspended in 50 μl of CEB and transferred to black 96-well Fluotrac 200 plates. Ac-IETD-AFC (50 μl) was then added to each well (to a final concentration of 50 μm), and liberation of free AFC was monitored for 1 h at 37 °C at excitation and emission wavelengths of 430 and 535 nm, respectively. 35S-Labeled Caspase-3 Cleavage Assays—Immunoprecipitated caspase-8 was washed as above and brought up in CEB containing in vitro transcribed and translated 35S-caspase-3 (in a final reaction volume of 15 μl). Reactions were allowed to proceed for 3 h at 37 °C and were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by analysis by SDS-PAGE/autoradiography. Affinity Labeling of Caspases—Caspases were active site labeled with biotinylated caspase substrate peptides, as follows. Cell-free extracts were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 100 nm granzyme B, or 50 μg/ml Cyt c and 1 mm dATP to initiate processing of caspases. Extracts (150-μl aliquots) were then incubated at 37 °C with 10 μm biotin-VAD-fmk, or 10 μm biotin-YVAD-cmk, and 50-μl samples were removed after 10, 20, and 30 min for assessment of caspase labeling. Biotinylated proteins were captured by dilution of 50-μl reactions to 250 μl with CEB, followed by the addition of agarose-streptavidin beads (30 μl/reaction) and incubation at 4 °C under continuous rotation for 3 h. Bound proteins were washed three times with CEB (1 ml/wash) and were eluted from beads by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by boiling for 7 min. Experiments based upon recombinant noncleavable forms of caspase-8 have suggested that dimerization of caspase-8 may be a prerequisite for activation of this protease (9Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol.

The dimerization model predicts that proteolytic processing of caspase-8, in the absence of a dimerization platform, may be insufficient for activation of this enzyme (9Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). To explore whether this model holds for endogenous full-length caspase-8, we have used two stimuli (granzyme B and caspase-6) that promote interchain proteolytic processing of caspase-8 in a dimerization-independent manner. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, caspase-8 underwent rapid proteolytic maturation upon introduction of recombinant granzyme B into cell-free extracts of Jurkat cells. Similar, but less rapid, processing of caspase-8 was also observed when Cyt c/dATP was added to Jurkat extracts to initiate assembly of Apaf-1/caspase-9 apoptosomes (Fig. 1A). Previous studies have established that caspase-8 processing in the apoptosome pathway is catalyzed by caspase-6, which is activated downstream of the apoptosome (4Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7320-7326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 13Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C.

Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1046-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). As expected, caspase-3 interchain processing also occurred in response to the addition of granzyme B or Cyt c/dATP to the extracts (Fig. 1A; Ref. 16Martin S.J. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Shi L. Chuang T.H. Casiano C.A. O'Brien G.A. Fitzgerald P. Tan E.M. Bokoch G.M. Greenberg A.H. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2407-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). To assess whether proteolytic processing of caspase-8 in these contexts produced catalytically active enzyme, we used two different biotinylated synthetic caspase substrates (biotin-VAD-fmk and biotin-YVAD-cmk) to label active caspases in the extracts after treatment with granzyme B or Cyt c/dATP. Using this approach, we found that although caspase-3 was labeled very efficiently by both peptides in extracts that had been treated with granzyme B or Cyt c/dATP, only trace amounts of proteolytically processed caspase-8 were labeled by comparison (Fig. 1, B and C). Similar observations have been made by Salvesen and colleagues (9Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar) (using biotin-VAD-fmk as an affinity label) and appear to support their proposal that direct interchain proteolysis of caspase-8 is insufficient for activation of this caspase. However, we sought to validate the biotinylated peptide labeling method as a means to detect catalytically active caspase-8 using extracts from cells that had been induced to undergo apoptosis through stimulation with anti-Fas IgM. In this context, it has been well established that caspase-8 is activated through FADD-dependent recruitment of the latter to receptor complexes (7Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar, 8Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar). Thus, Jurkat cells were treated with 100 ng/ml anti-Fas mAb for 4 h at which time ∼70% of these cells were annexin V-positive and thus undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 2A). Cell-free extracts prepared from the latter cells were incubated with biotin-VAD-fmk or biotin-YVAD-cmk to label active caspases using the same procedures as before. However, once again we found that only trace amounts of caspase-8 could be labeled using this method (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, active caspase-3 was labeled very efficiently in the same samples (Fig. 2, B and C). These data strongly suggest that biotinylated caspase substrate peptides preferentially label certain caspases (such as caspase-3) where a mixture of different active caspases is present. Because of the problems associated with peptide affinity labeling as discussed above, we used a more direct approach to assess the catalytic competence of caspase-8 after direct processing by granzyme B or caspase-6. Using a panel of caspase-8 mAbs, we immunoprecipitated caspase-8 from control, granzyme B-treated, or Cyt c/dATP-treated cell-free extracts. As illustrated in Fig. 3A, these antibodies immunoprecipitated both the full-length caspase-8 zymogen as well as the proteolytically processed form of this protease. Importantly, neither FADD nor caspase-3 coprecipitated with caspase-8 under the conditions used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3A). We then assessed the ability of immunocaptured caspase-8 to cleave the caspase-8 preferred substrate, Ac-IETD-AFC. As Fig. 3B shows, whereas immunocaptured procaspase-8 failed to display any activity in this assay, proteolytically processed caspase-8 derived from cell-free extracts that had been incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with granzyme B, or Cyt c/dATP, was catalytically active. In contrast, caspase-8 immunoprecipitates generated from cell-free extracts treated with granzyme B at 4 °C (where granzyme B did not proteolytically process caspase-8) did not display any IETD-AFC hydrolysis activity (Fig. 3C). The latter result excluded the possibility that granzyme B was nonspecifically captured during the caspase-8 immunoprecipitations and contributed to the IETD-AFC hydrolysis activity seen. Essentially similar results were observed using four different caspase-8 antibodies, with granzyme B-mediated processing, or Cyt c/dATP-stimulation, generating catalytically active caspase-8 in all cases (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, caspase-8 immunocaptured from granzyme B or Cyt c/dATP-treated extracts also displayed proteolytic activity toward one of its natural substrates, caspase-3 (Fig. 3D). We also explored whether caspase-8 immunocaptured from Fas-stimulated cells displayed enhanced catalytic activity compared with caspase-8 captured from granzyme B- or Cyt c/dATP-treated cell-free extracts. However, as Fig. 4 illustrates, similar rates of IETD-AFC hydrolysis were observed irrespective of whether caspase-8 was immunoprecipitated from cell-free extracts generated from anti-Fas-stimulated cells, or Cyt c/dATP-treated cell-free extracts. To determine whether the caspase-8 adaptor protein FADD plays any role in the activation of caspase-8 in granzyme B- or Cyt c/dATP-stimulated cell-free extracts, we used extracts generated from FADD-deficient Jurkat cells (Fig. 5 A; Ref. 17Juo P. Woo M.S. Kuo C.J. Signorelli P. Biemann H.P. Hannun Y.A. Blenis J. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 797-804PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to extracts derived from wild-type Jurkat cells, FADD-deficient extracts readily supported granzyme B- or Cyt c/dATP-induced caspase-8 proteolytic processing, as expected (Fig. 5B). Moreover, immunoprecipitation of caspase-8 from FADD-deficient extracts after treatment with granzyme B or Cyt c/dATP yielded catalytically active protease (Fig. 5 C and D). These data exclude the possibility that FADD plays a role as a dimerization platform for caspase-8 in the context of granzyme B- or caspase-6-initiated caspase-8 activation. It has been reported that the inactive caspase-8 zymogen exists primarily as a monomer (9Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Because we observed that caspase-8 acquired catalytic competence upon direct proteolytic processing by granzyme B or caspase-6, we wondered whether we could detect a shift of caspase-8 from a monomeric state to a dimeric state under these conditions. To address this question, we ran native PAGE of cell-free extracts that were either untreated or were exposed to granzyme B or Cyt c/dATP to initiate caspase-8 processing and activation. As Fig. 6A illustrates, no significant shift to a dimeric state was detectable after proteolytic processing of caspase-8. In sharp contrast, caspase-3 displayed a very significant increase in apparent molecular mass in the same assay (Fig. 6A). However, it should be noted that two bands of caspase-8-immunoreactive material, which may represent dimeric or oligomeric forms of this protease, were seen under all conditions (Fig. 6A). This could indicate that caspase-8 may exist in an equilibrium between a monomeric and dimeric state even in healthy cells. Proteolytic processing of the small fraction of preexisting dimers may therefore liberate the catalytic activity of this enzyme. To explore further whether proteolytic processing of caspase-8 could promote dimerization of this protease we also used a covalent cross-linker, bismaleimidohexane (Fig. 6B). Using this approach, we again observed a small fraction of caspase-8-immunoreactive material that may represent dimeric or oligomeric caspase-8 complexes even in control cell lysates. A small increase in the abundance of these complexes was seen after proteolytic processing of caspase-8 by granzyme B or caspase-6 (Fig. 6B). However, the majority of caspase-8 clearly remained as a monomer (Fig. 6B). The data presented herein argue that direct interchain proteolysis of caspase-8 is sufficient to generate catalytically active protease. Thus, the appearance of caspase-8-processing signatures is a valid means of assessing caspase activation status in the context of cytotoxic T lymphocyte/natural killer-mediated killing or apoptosome-initiated caspase-8 activation. Based upon native PAGE analysis and size exclusion chromatography, it has been argued that caspase-8 exists primarily in monomeric form within cells (9Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). If this is correct, our data suggest that proteolytically processed caspase-8 may be active as a monomer, or alternatively, that proteolysis of this enzyme promotes dimer formation. In support of the latter view, it has been found that substrate binding promotes formation of caspase-8 dimers (10Donepudi M. Mac Sweeney A. Briand C. Grutter M.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 543-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has also been shown that although recombinant caspase-8 autoprocesses and exists in an equilibrium between dimers and monomers, noncleavable caspase-8 exists predominantly (>97%) as a monomer. The latter observation argues that proteolytic processing of caspase-8 facilitates dimer formation. Thus, in the context of granzyme B or caspase-6-mediated activation, caspase-8 monomers may form dimers spontaneously upon proteolytic processing to a two-chain enzyme. However, using native PAGE analysis as well as cross-linking experiments, we did not find convincing evidence in support of the latter idea. Alternatively, the proteolytic activity we observe in our experiments may be the result of interchain proteolysis of a small proportion of preexisting caspase-8 dimers in healthy cells. Indeed, native PAGE and cross-linking experiments consistently detected caspase-8-immunoreactive material running at a molecular mass higher than expected in cell-free extracts derived from healthy cells. Because we did not detect proteolytic activity associated with procaspase-8 immunoprecipitated from extracts generated from viable cells, preexisting dimers, if present, are catalytically inactive. Although our data do not rule out the possibility that caspase-8 may acquire catalytic competence in the absence of proteolytic maturation in certain contexts, we show that enforced dimerization is not essential for caspase-8 activation. Thus, there may be situations in which induced dimerization may indeed be sufficient to achieve catalytic competence of caspase-8, as proposed recently (9Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). However, notwithstanding this possibility, our data argue that interchain proteolysis of native caspase-8 is sufficient to drive activation of this caspase and that a dimerization platform is not a prerequisite for activation of this protease.

Chronically activated T cells undergo activation-induced cell death (AICD), which depends on simultaneous Fas and Fas ligand expression. Previous reports have suggested that AICD might be linked to cell cycle progression of T cells and therefore to the expression of cell cycle-related molecules. In particular, cyclin B1 has been implicated in the induction of AICD in T cells. In this study, we have investigated the role of cyclin B1 in AICD and the expression of effector molecules involved in this form of cell death. Our results show that inhibition of cyclin B1 blocks AICD in T cells through specific inhibition of Fas ligand expression but not Fas-induced apoptosis. This effect of cyclin B1 appears to be mediated through the cyclin B1/cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1/Cdc2) complex because overexpression of cyclin B1 enhances FasL promoter activity, whereas a dominant-negative version of Cdk1 blocks Fas ligand promoter induction. We provide further evidence that cyclin B1/Cdk1 regulates FasL transcription through the regulation of NFκB activation because dominant-negative Cdk1 inhibits activation-induced NFκB reporter and Rel A-induced FasL promoter activity.

In particular, Fas ligand (FasL, CD95L) has been implicated in homeostatic T and B lymphocyte apoptosis, and mice lacking either functional FasL (gld/gld mice) or Fas receptor (lpr/lpr or Fas gene-deficient mice) show accumulation of autoreactive T and B cells and development of autoimmune diseases with increasing age (reviewed in Refs. 2Lenardo M.

Similarly, human patients with genetic defects in the Fas or FasL genes suffer from an autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), characterized by lymphoproliferative disorder, splenomegaly, and a systemic lupus erythematosus-like disease (6Rieux-Laucat F.

This strongly supports the idea that Fas-induced apoptosis is important in the maintenance of lymphocyte homeostasis and self-tolerance. Upon restimulation of previously activated T cells, cells rapidly undergo apoptotic cell death. We and others (7Brunner T. Mogil R.J. La Face D. Yoo N.J. Mahboubi A. Echeverri F. Martin S.J.

Most interestingly, AICD even occurs in a cell autonomous manner, indicating that FasL interacts with Fas on the same cell (7Brunner T. Mogil R.J. La Face D. Yoo N.J. Mahboubi A. Echeverri F.

Nature. 1995; 373: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). In vivo, however, a different mechanism may be responsible for the demise of activated T cells. Upon in vivo activation, T cells express the Fas receptor and become sensitized for Fas-induced apoptosis. The release of tumor necrosis factor-α by activated T cells induces the expression of FasL in intestinal epithelial cells and liver macrophages, which upon contact kill the activated T cells (11Bonfoco E.

Although these data suggest that T cell-expressed Fas receptor, rather than the ligand, is crucial for homeostatic cell death of activated T cells during an immune response, other reports (13Rathmell J.C. Townsend S.E. Xu J.C. Flavell R.A. Goodnow C.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that FasL-expressing T cells are responsible for the elimination of autoreactive B cells through Fas-induced apoptosis. Similarly, FasL is one of the major cytotoxic T cell effector mechanisms, and excessive FasL-mediated apoptosis and tissue destruction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, such as hepatitis (14Kondo T. Suda T. Fukuyama H. Adachi M. Nagata S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), acute graft-versus-host disease (15Braun M.Y. Lowin B. French L. Acha-Orbea H.

These findings strongly support the notion that the regulation of FasL expression on activated T cells is a crucial event in the control of various immune responses. We and others have characterized previously various transcription factors that regulate FasL gene expression in T cells. These include NFAT (19Brunner T. Yoo N.J. La Face D. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Int.

More recently, we have found that c-Myc, a transcription factor crucially involved in cell cycle progression, directly regulates FasL transcription through interaction with a noncanonical consensus sequence in the FasL promoter (25Brunner T. Kasibhatla S. Pinkoski M.J. Frutschi C. Yoo N.J. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. J. Biol.

Regulation of FasL expression by c-Myc may ensure that only proliferating cycling T cells are capable of efficiently expressing FasL upon stimulation. Most interestingly, another cell cycle-related molecule has been implicated in (Fas/FasL-dependent) AICD in T cells. Cyclin B1 associates with cyclin-dependent kinases and regulates their activities in promoting cell cycle progression (reviewed in Refs. 29Castedo M. Perfettini J.L. Roumier T. Kroemer G. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1287-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar and 30Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Fotedar et al. (31Fotedar R. Flatt J. Gupta S. Margolis R.L. Fitzgerald P. Messier H. Fotedar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 932-942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have found previously that cyclin B1 is required for AICD in T cell hybridomas. In this study, we have investigated the specific role of cyclin B1 in the regulation of AICD. We have found that down-regulation of cyclin B1 by antisense oligonucleotides, or olomoucine, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, specifically blocks FasL expression but not Fas-induced apoptosis. Most intriguingly, this effect on activation-induced FasL expression appears to be mediated by the cyclin B1/Cdk1 complex because overexpression of cyclin B1 was found to enhance FasL promoter activity, whereas a dominant-negative form of Cdk1 inhibited FasL promoter activity. We provide further evidence that the cyclin B1/Cdk1 complex may act on the activation of the FasL promoter through the regulation of NFκB activity. Our present data confirm a role for cyclin B1 in AICD and FasL expression, and further support a link between cell cycle regulation and FasL expression. Reagents and Media—The T cell hybridoma A1.1 has been described previously (7Brunner T. Mogil R.J. La Face D. Yoo N.J. Mahboubi A. Echeverri F. Martin S.J. Force W.R. Lynch D.H. Ware C.F. et al.Nature. 1995; 373: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar, 19Brunner T. Yoo N.J. La Face D. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were obtained from the ATCC. Cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (complete medium). For transfection of Jurkat cells, serum-free AIM-V medium (Invitrogen) was used. Normal murine T cell blasts were generated by dissociating the spleen of C57BL/6 mice between frosted microscopy glass slides and subsequent hypotonic lysis to remove erythrocytes. After resuspension in complete medium, cells were stimulated for 2 days with 1 μg/ml concanavalin A (Sigma), washed once to remove the lectin, and cultured with 100 units/ml recombinant IL-2 (Proleukin, Chiron) for another 3 days to generate T cell blasts. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was purchased from Sigma, and ionomycin was from Calbiochem. Olomoucine, iso-olomoucine, and nocodazole were from Alexis (Lausen, Switzerland). Hamster anti-mouse CD3ϵ (clone 145–2C11) was purified from culture supernatant by protein A affinity chromatography. Anti-human Fas was obtained from MBL (clone CH-11, Labforce, Nuningen, Switzerland). Anti-mouse FasL (clone MFL3) and anti-cyclin B1 (clone GNS-11) were from Pharmingen. Anti-c-Myc has been described previously (25Brunner T. Kasibhatla S. Pinkoski M.J. Frutschi C. Yoo N.J. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9767-9772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides were obtained from Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). The following previously published sequences were used: antisense (AS) cyclin B1, 5′-CAT CGG GCT TGG AGA GGG ATT-3′, and nonsense (NS) cyclin B1, 5′-TGA GGC ATT TGA GCT CGG GAG-3′ (31Fotedar R. Flatt J. Gupta S. Margolis R.L. Fitzgerald P. Messier H. Fotedar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 932-942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NS cyclin B1 oligonucleotide contains the same nucleotide composition as AS cyclin B1, however, with a random sequence. Detection of Cyclin B1 Expression by Flow Cytometry—Protein levels of cyclin B1 in AS- or NS-treated cells were assessed by intracellular staining and detection by flow cytometry. Briefly, A1.1 cells were incubated with 10 μm AS or NS cyclin B1 overnight. After that, cells were harvested, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then stained with cyclin B1 antibody or isotype control and phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody. After fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, cyclin B1 expression was assessed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences) by using Cellquest software. Electronic gates were set around viable cells based on forward-side scatter properties. The inhibition of cyclin B1 expression was analyzed for statistical significance using Student's t test. Treatment of cells overnight with AS cyclin B1 resulted in ∼27% reduction in cyclin B1-positive cells compared with control cells (p > 0.005). AICD—A1.1 cells (5 × 104/200 μl) were preincubated with medium control or different concentrations of cyclin B1 AS or NS for 4 h or with olomoucine or iso-olomoucine for 30 min, prior to stimulation with medium control or immobilized anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml) in 96-well flat bottom plates. Cells were then incubated for 16 h, and apoptosis was assessed by annexin V staining, as described previously (25Brunner T. Kasibhatla S. Pinkoski M.J. Frutschi C. Yoo N.J. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A.

Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 706-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Assessment of Functional FasL Expression—Functional FasL expression on activated T cells was assessed by the ability to induce DNA fragmentation in Fas-sensitive target cells (7Brunner T. Mogil R.J. La Face D. Yoo N.J. Mahboubi A. Echeverri F. Martin S.J. Force W.R. Lynch D.H. Ware C.F. et al.Nature. 1995; 373: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar, 19Brunner T. Yoo N.J. La Face D.

A1.1 cells (8 × 104/100 μl) or murine T cell blasts (2 × 105/100 μl) were preincubated with medium control or different concentrations of olomoucine or isoolomoucine for 30 min, or cyclin B1 AS or NS for 4 h, prior to transfer to control or anti-CD3-coated 96-well flat bottom plates. Fas-sensitive Jurkat cells were labeled with 5 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for 2 h at 1 × 106/ml in complete medium, washed two times in PBS, and resuspended in medium. Target cells (2 × 104/100 μl) were then added to the activated T cells. After 18 h, 5 mm EDTA in PBS was added, and nonfragmented [3H]thymidine-labeled DNA was harvested on glass fiber filters and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. DNA fragmentation was assessed as follows: % DNA fragmentation = 100 × (1 – cpm experimental group/cpm control group) ± S.D. Specificity of FasL-mediated cytotoxicity was confirmed by neutralization with 10 μg/ml anti-FasL. RT-PCR for FasL—A1.1 cells were either preincubated with medium control, olomoucine, iso-olomoucine (50 μm), or AS or NS cyclin B1 oligonucleotides (10 μm) for 4 h. After that cells were either left untreated or stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml) for 4 h. Cells were then harvested, and total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagents per the manufacturer's suggested protocol (Sigma). Two μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using a commercial kit and the manufacturer's suggested conditions (Promega, Madison, WI). For real time PCR 1 μl of 1:2 diluted RT product was then added to the PCR mix consisting of 12.5 μl of SYBR Green mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 1.5 μl of forward primer (5 μm), 1.5 μl of reverse primer (5 μm), and 8.5 μl of H2O. The following primers were used: for murine FasL, forward 5′-CAGCAGTGCCACTTCATCTTGG-3′ and reverse 5′-TTCACTCCAGAGATCAGAGCGG-3′; for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, forward 5′-TTCACCACCATGGAGAAGGC-3′ and reverse 5′-GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGA-3′. The DNA was amplified in a TaqMan PCR machine (Applied Biosystems) using the following conditions: 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, and 45 cycles for 5 s at 95 °C and 2 min at 60 °C. FasL gene expression was calculated by using the Sequence Detection System version 1.7 from Applied Biosystems. Alternatively, FasL and actin expression were also assessed by semi-quantitative conventional RT-PCR as described previously (33Wasem C. Frutschi C. Arnold D. Vallan C. Lin T. Green D.R. Mueller C. Brunner T. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2936-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cell Cycle Analysis and FasL Expression—A1.1 cells were either left untreated or cultured overnight with 100 μg/ml nocodazole to induce a cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase. Cells were then washed two times with PBS and resuspended in medium without nocodazole. After 0, 2, 4, or 6 h an aliquot of the nocodazole-treated cells or control cells was harvested, and the DNA content, as a measurement of cell cycle progression, was analyzed by propidium iodide staining (7Brunner T. Mogil R.J. La Face D. Yoo N.J. Mahboubi A. Echeverri F. Martin S.J. Force W.R. Lynch D.H. Ware C.F. et al.Nature. 1995; 373: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). At the same time points, aliquots were collected and either cultured for 1 h in medium or in anti-CD3-coated tissue culture plates. Cells were then harvested, and total RNA was isolated. FasL mRNA expression was analyzed using the assay-on-demand kit and 18 S rRNA as internal control as suggested by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Western Blotting—A1.1 cells were treated with medium control or nocodazole as described above. Cell cycle-synchronized cells were harvested at different time points and lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After electrophoresis on a 12% gel and transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, cyclin B1 and c-Myc expression were detected by using corresponding primary and secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence. Equal protein loading was confirmed by the detection of tubulin. FasL Promoter Reporter Assay—FasL promoter activity was assessed as described previously (23Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L.

Briefly, Jurkat cells (106/ml) were transiently transfected with 3 μg of luciferase reporter construct, containing a 1.2-kb fragment of the human FasL promoter (HFLP) (23Kasibhatla S. Brunner T.

After overnight culture, cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in complete medium. Cells were then stimulated for 16 h with medium control or 50 ng/ml PMA and 500 ng/ml ionomycin, washed, and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 92 mm KH2PO4, 0.91 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Luciferase activity in the cell-free supernatant was assessed in a TD-20/20 luminometer (BioSystems, Sunnyvale, CA) and normalized with β-galactosidase activity to correct for different transfection efficiencies. In some experiments, cells were also co-transfected with human cyclin B1 (pCMV cyclin B1, kindly provided by Ruth J. Muschel, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia (34Kao G.D. McKenna W.G.

Cyclin B1 Antisense Oligonucleotides Down-regulate Cyclin B1 Protein Expression—A previous report by Fotedar et al. (31Fotedar R. Flatt J. Gupta S. Margolis R.L. Fitzgerald P. Messier H. Fotedar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 932-942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that treatment of A1.1 T cell hybridomas with cyclin B1 antisense oligonucleotides resulted in inhibition of activation-induced apoptosis. Our next goal was to investigate the molecular basis by which cyclin B1 antisense inhibits this form of T cell apoptosis. In order to assess the activity of the antisense oligonucleotides used, A1.1 T cells were treated with cyclin B1 antisense or as a control nonsense oligonucleotides, and expression levels of cyclin B1 protein were examined by flow cytometry. Fig. 1A shows that treatment of cells with antisense oligonucleotides resulted in a clear and significant inhibition of cyclin B1 expression, whereas control nonsense oligonucleotides did not alter cyclin B1 expression. Role of Cyclin B1/Cdk1 Complex in Activation-induced FasL Expression—Our previous findings have demonstrated that AICD in CD4+ T cells occurs through activation-induced expression of Fas and FasL and subsequent Fas-induced apoptosis (7Brunner T. Mogil R.J. La Face D. Yoo N.J. Mahboubi A. Echeverri F. Martin S.J. Force W.R. Lynch D.H. Ware C.F. et al.Nature. 1995; 373: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar, 19Brunner T. Yoo N.J.

Green D. Swain S.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1837-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In this process, the regulation of FasL expression appears to be a particularly important component because most inhibitors of AICD affect FasL transcription (37Brunner T. Yoo N.J. Griffith T.S. Ferguson T.A. Green D.R. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1996; 97: 161-174PubMed Google Scholar). We have thus investigated whether inhibition of cyclin B1 expression inhibits FasL expression. A1.1 cells rapidly express FasL on their cell surface upon stimulation with plate-bound anti-CD3 (7Brunner T. Mogil R.J. La Face D. Yoo N.J. Mahboubi A. Echeverri F. Martin S.J. Force W.R. Lynch D.H. Ware C.F. et al.Nature. 1995; 373: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). This can be monitored by the ability to induce DNA fragmentation in Fas-sensitive targets, such as Jurkat cells (7Brunner T. Mogil R.J. La Face D. Yoo N.J. Mahboubi A. Echeverri F. Martin S.J. Force W.R. Lynch D.H. Ware C.F. et al.Nature. 1995; 373: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar, 19Brunner T. Yoo N.J. La Face D. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Int.

Immunol. 2001; 167: 2936-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B demonstrates that activated A1.1 cells potently induce DNA fragmentation in Jurkat cells in a FasL-dependent manner, because target cell apoptosis was completely blocked by a neutralizing anti-FasL antibody. Most importantly, FasL-mediated DNA fragmentation was clearly reduced when A1.1 cells were preincubated with AS cyclin B1, but not with NS cyclin B1, oligonucleotides. This suggests that cyclin B1 expression is required for activation-induced FasL expression. Cyclin B1 primarily associates with the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1 and regulates its activity (30Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Olomoucine is a potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, with a preference for Cdk1 and Cdk2. We thus analyzed its effect on activation-induced functional FasL expression. Similarly to the inhibition of cyclin B1 by AS oligonucleotides, olomoucine clearly inhibited the activation-induced expression of functional FasL and thus the DNA fragmentation of the target cells (Fig. 1C). No inhibition was seen with the control reagent iso-olomoucine. Because T cell hybridoma cells, such as A1.1 cells, may behave differently than regular T cells, we confirmed these data using normal mouse T cells. Fig. 1D shows that olomoucine, but not iso-olomoucine, also inhibited functional FasL expression in mouse T cell blasts, although to a lesser degree than in A1.1 T cell hybridomas. Inhibitors of the Cyclin B1/Cdk1 Complex Do Not Block Fas-induced Apoptosis—To ensure that the reagents used did not affect the Fas signaling in the target cells and would thus result in reduced DNA fragmentation, we analyzed the effect of olomoucine and AS cyclin B1 on anti-Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Fas cross-linking by the anti-Fas IgM antibody potently induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells, as measured by annexin V staining. However, neither AS cyclin B1, olomoucine, nor their control reagents significantly inhibited apoptosis induction (data not shown). This confirms previous findings by others (38Waring P. Mullbacher A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 39De Luca A. De Maria R. Baldi A. Trotta R. Facchiano F. Giordano A. Testi R. Condorelli G. J. Cell.

Antisense Cyclin B1 and Olomoucine Block Activation-induced FasL Transcription—To confirm that inhibition of the cyclin B1/Cdk1 complex by AS cyclin B1 or olomoucine targets FasL gene expression, we directly assessed FasL transcription by RT-PCR. Fig. 2A shows that FasL expression was not detected in unstimulated cells but was induced upon stimulation with plate-bound anti-CD3.

https://openalex.org/W2159985815,"The repair of psoralen interstrand cross-links in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae involves the DNA repair groups nucleotide excision repair (NER), homologous recombination (HR), and post-replication repair (PRR). In repair-proficient yeast cells cross-links induce double-strand breaks, in an NER-dependent process; the double-strand breaks are then repaired by HR. An alternate error-prone repair pathway generates mutations at cross-link sites. We have characterized the repair of plasmid molecules carrying a single psoralen cross-link, psoralen monoadduct, or double-strand break in yeast cells with deficiencies in NER, HR, or PRR genes, measuring the repair efficiencies and the levels of gene conversions, crossing over, and mutations. Strains with deficiencies in the NER genes RAD1, RAD3, RAD4, and RAD10 had low levels of cross-link-induced recombination but higher mutation frequencies than repair-proficient cells. Deletion of the HR genes RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, RAD55, and RAD57 also decreased induced recombination and increased mutation frequencies above those of NER-deficient yeast. Strains lacking the PRR genes RAD5, RAD6, and RAD18 did not have any cross-link-induced mutations but showed increased levels of recombination; rad5 and rad6 cells also had altered patterns of cross-link-induced gene conversion in comparison with repair-proficient yeast. Our observations suggest that psoralen cross-links can be repaired by three pathways: an error-free recombinational pathway requiring NER and HR and two PRR-dependent errorprone pathways, one NER-dependent and one NER-independent.

DNA interstrand cross-links are complex lesions, highly toxic to cells, and difficult to repair because of the involvement of both strands of the DNA duplex. A single unrepaired interstrand cross-link is sufficient to kill a cell, and multiple DNA repair pathways may be required to complete cross-link removal (1Dronkert M.L.G. Kanaar R. Mutat.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has three major DNA repair epistasis groups, all of which are involved in cross-link repair; they are nucleotide excision repair, recombinational repair, and post-replication repair (8Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Nucleotide excision repair (NER) 1The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; HR, homologous recombination; DSB, double strand break; PRR, post-replication repair. is a general system that recognizes bulky and helix-distorting lesions (9Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 10Prakash S. Prakash L. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Endonucleases nick the affected DNA strand on both the 5′ and 3′ sides of the lesion; after removal of the damaged oligonucleotide, the resulting singlestrand gap is filled in by polymerase activity using the undamaged strand as a template. This mechanism produces error-free repair of single-strand damage. Recombinational repair is the major pathway for repair of double-strand damage, such as double-strand breaks (DSBs) or gaps in yeast (11Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 66: 630-670Crossref Scopus (815) Google Scholar). In homologous recombination (HR) the broken DNA molecule is repaired, and missing genetic information is restored through interactions with intact homologous sequences. This pathway is also non-mutagenic but can result in DNA rearrangements. Post-replication repair (PRR) acts on damage in the context of DNA replication, allowing for bypass of replication fork-blocking lesions; this pathway, rather than removing lesions, permits replicating cells to tolerate the damage (13Barbour L. Xiao W. Mutat. Res. 2003; 532: 137-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 14Friedberg E.C. Wagner R. Radman M. Science. 2002; 296: 1627-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Lesion bypass may be achieved by error-prone mechanisms, such as trans-lesion synthesis by specialized DNA repair polymerases, or by error-free mechanisms, such as template switching. Psoralen undergoes photoreaction with DNA to form monoadducts and interstrand cross-links (15Cimino G.D. Gamper H.B. Isaacs S.T. Hearst J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1151-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 16Tessman J.W. Isaacs S.T. Hearst J.E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1669-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Psoralen photoreaction of replicating yeast cells induces NER-dependent DNA breaks; monoadducts induce single-strand nicks, whereas interstrand cross-links induce DSBs (2Magana-Schwencke N.

Rejoining of the cross-link-induced DSBs depends on the HR genes RAD51 and RAD52 (2Magana-Schwencke N. Henriques J.A. Chanet R. Moustacchi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These observations suggest the following two-step model for psoralen cross-link repair; 1) NER acts on cross-links to produce DSBs, and 2) the DSBs are repaired by HR. Evidence in support of this pathway includes the sensitivities of NER- and recombination-deficient yeast strains to psoralen photoreaction and the induction of homologous recombination by cross-links (24Averbeck D. Moustacchi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 395: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Henriques J.A.P. Moustacchi E. Photochem.

Photobiol. 1984; 39: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, an additional pathway for cross-link repair exists, as indicated by the sensitivity of PRR-deficient yeast cells and cross-link-induced mutagenesis (26Henriques J.A.P. Moustacchi E. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 248-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Grossman K.F. Ward A.M. Matkovic M.E. Folias A.E. Moses R.E. Mutat.

Chanet R. Moustacchi E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1985; 41: 289-294Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Interstrand cross-links, therefore, appear to be repaired by alternate pathways involving recombination or mutation. In a previous study of psoralen photodamage repair in repair-proficient yeast cells (30Greenberg R.B. Alberti M. Hearst J.E. Chua M.A. Saffran W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31551-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) we found that interstrand cross-links placed at a specific site within plasmid molecules induced homologous recombination in the majority of repair events and mutations targeted to the damage site in a smaller fraction of the repaired plasmids. There was no overlap between these endpoints, suggesting that the recombinational and errorprone pathways are independent, alternate mechanisms for interstrand cross-link repair. A model for psoralen cross-link repair is shown in Fig. 1. In the current study we have characterized the repair of these plasmid molecules in yeast strains with deficiencies in each of the three major DNA repair epistasis groups. We find that blocking either NER or HR channels cross-links into mutagenic repair, whereas blocking PRR channels cross-links into recombinational repair. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—Yeast strains were constructed from W1588–4A, MATα his3-11,15 ura3-1 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ade2-1 can1-100, which is a RAD5 derivative of W303 (31Fan H.Y. Cheng K.K. Klein H.L. Genetics. 1996; 142: 749-759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The his3-11,15 allele was replaced by his3-207X; this allele is an XbaI linker insertion at position 207 of the HIS3 gene. Isogenic repair-deficient strains carry one of the following alleles: rad1::LEU2, rad3–2, rad4::LEU2, rad5::URA3, rad6::URA3, rad10::LEU2, rad18::URA3, rad51::LEU2, rad52::LEU2, rad54::LEU2, rad55::LEU2, or rad57::LEU2. The plasmid phis3-622X is derived from the phagemid vector pIBI25; it carries a TRP1-ARS1 fragment as well as the his3-622X allele, which has an XbaI insertion at position 622. Plasmid phis3-207X is similar to phis3-622X but with an XbaI insertion at position 207. Preparation of Plasmids with Site-specific Damage—Plasmids with DSBs were prepared by digestion with BsiWI. Plasmids with psoralen monoadducts or cross-links were prepared as previously described (30Greenberg R.B. Alberti M. Hearst J.E. Chua M.A. Saffran W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31551-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 14-base oligonucleotide primer, 5′-CAGGCCGTACGCAG-3′, was photoreacted with 4′-hydroxymethyl-4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralen to produce an adduct at the unique T position. For preparation of monoadducted plasmids the modified primer was annealed to the single-stranded form of the phagemid and extended with DNA polymerase to form the second strand. For generation of cross-linked plasmid the annealed preparation of primer with single-stranded circles was irradiated with near ultraviolet light to convert the monoadducts to cross-links before second-strand synthesis. Covalently closed circles were formed with DNA ligase and purified by centrifugation through CsCl gradients in the presence of ethidium bromide. Plasmid Repair and Genetic Analysis—Yeast cells were converted to spheroplasts and transformed with modified plasmids as previously described (30Greenberg R.B. Alberti M. Hearst J.E. Chua M.A. Saffran W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31551-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) using 0.1 μg of plasmid and 5 μg of single-stranded carrier DNA per sample. Transformed cells were selected on tryptophan omission medium, and colonies were scored after 4 days. Trp+ colonies were replica-plated to histidine omission medium to determine the histidine phenotype; growth after 1 day was scored as His+, and growth after 2 days was scored as His+/–. Plasmid integration was measured by determining the stability of the Trp+ and His+ phenotypes; Trp+ colonies were serially replicated to three yeast extract-peptone-dextrose plates to dilute out extrachromosomally replicating plasmid then replicated back to tryptophan and histidine omission plates. For experiments with plasmid phis3-207X only repair and plasmid integration were measured. Physical Analysis—Plasmid DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction to characterize gene conversion and mutation patterns. Primers VF1 (5′-ACACTTTATGCTTCCGGCTCG-3′) and HF2 (5′-CTTAGCCATTGGCATTATCACA-3′) were used to amplify the plasmid HIS3 gene only. Reactions were performed in 2.0 mm magnesium, 200 μm each dNTP, 0.25 μm each primer, and 10 ng of template DNA. Amplification was carried out for 30 cycles of 2 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 77 °C. The amplification product was digested with XbaI to characterize gene conversion. The his3-622X allele yields three fragments of 164, 682, and 729 bp with XbaI digestion. Conversion to his3-207X produces fragments of 164, 314, and 1097 bp, conversion to his3-207X,622X produces fragments of 164, 314, 415, and 682 bp, and conversion to HIS3 produces two fragments of 164 and 1411 bp. The amplification product was also digested with BsiWI to detect mutations at the damage site; phis3-622X yields fragments of 523 and 1052 bp, whereas mutants are refractory to BsiWI digestion. Integrated plasmids were characterized by Southern analysis as previously described (30Greenberg R.B. Alberti M. Hearst J.E. Chua M.A. Saffran W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31551-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Experimental Design—Plasmid molecules were modified in vitro to produce DNA damage at a unique site. Plasmid phis3-622X is a yeast replicating plasmid carrying the TRP1 and HIS3 genes. It contains an ARS replication origin but no centromere sequence. Psoralen monoadducts or interstrand cross-links were added at the unique BsiWI site at position 418 in the HIS3 gene; the BsiWI recognition sequence, 5′-CGTACG-3′, includes a preferential psoralen binding site. DSBs were produced at the same site by BsiWI digestion. Yeast cells were transformed with intact or modified plasmids, and repair was measured as the transformation efficiency of damaged plasmid relative to undamaged plasmid. Transformation was monitored as the appearance of Trp+ colonies.

Open table in a new tab Colonies carrying repaired plasmids underwent genetic and physical analysis to detect mutation and recombination. Homologous recombination produces crossing-over and gene conversion. Crossing-over leading to plasmid integration was detected as stable Trp+ colonies; the extrachromosomal plasmids, lacking centromeres, are unstable under nonselective conditions. The frequencies of plasmid integration are presented in Table II. Gene conversion within HIS3 was detected by growth rate on histidine omission medium. The his3-622X allele has an 8-base pair XbaI linker insertion at position 622 of HIS3. This mutation is near the end of the coding region, and the gene product retains residual activity. Yeast cells carrying this allele on a multicopy plasmid grow slowly on histidine omission medium; this phenotype is denoted as His+/–. Conversion between the damaged plasmid and undamaged chromosomal his3 allele produces a phenotypic change to His+ or His–, as depicted in Fig. 2. Conversion in the downstream (3′) direction produces His+ colonies that grow quickly on histidine omission medium, whereas conversion in the upstream (5′) direction and bidirectional conversion produce His– colonies that show no growth in the absence of histidine. Mutations at the damage site generally inactivate the gene, also producing a His– phenotype. Phenotypic changes to His+ and His– are given in Table III.Table IIDamage-induced plasmid integrationStrainDSBsMonoadductsCross-linksFraction Trp+ stable (relative to RAD)Fraction Trp+ stableFraction Trp+ stable (relative to RAD)Repair-proficientRAD0.334 ± 0.056 (1.00)0.004 ± 0.0080.219 ± 0.050 (1.00)Nucleotide excision repair-deficientrad10.144 ± 0.039 (0.431)aSignificantly different than RAD by Fisher's exact test.0.008 ± 0.0090.072 ± 0.047 (0.329)aSignificantly different than RAD by Fisher's exact test.rad30.243 ± 0.127 (0.727)0.008 ± 0.0110.154 ± 0.040 (0.703)rad40.324 ± 0.186 (0.970)00.042 ± 0.045 (0.192)aSignificantly different than RAD by Fisher's exact test.rad100.081 ± 0.006 (0.242)aSignificantly different than RAD by Fisher's exact test.00.012 ± 0.018 (0.055)aSignificantly different than RAD by Fisher's exact test.Homologous recombination-deficientrad510.016 ± 0.027 (0.048)aSignificantly different than RAD by Fisher's exact test.0.005 ± 0.0080.014 ± 0.013 (0.064)aSignificantly different than RAD by Fisher's exact test.rad520aSignificantly different than RAD by Fisher's exact test.00.005 ± 0.010 (0.023)aSignificantly different than RAD by Fisher's exact test.rad540.006 ± 0.009 (0.018)aSignificantly different than RAD by Fisher's exact test.0.005 ± 0.0070.002 ± 0.004 (0.009)aSignificantly different than RAD by Fisher's exact test.rad550.014 ± 0.019 (0.042)aSignificantly different than RAD by Fisher's exact test.00aSignificantly different than RAD by Fisher's exact test.Postreplication repair-deficientrad50.408 ± 0.219 (1.22)0.002 ± 0.0050.369 ± 0.085 (1.68)aSignificantly different than RAD by Fisher's exact test.rad60.344 ± 0.004 (1.03)00.318 ± 0.085 (1.45)aSignificantly different than RAD by Fisher's exact test.rad180.268 ± 0.059 (0.802)0.010 ± 0.0140.399 ± 0.029 (1.82)aSignificantly different than RAD by Fisher's exact test.a Significantly different than RAD by Fisher's exact test.

Open table in a new tab Repair-proficient Cells—Plasmids carrying DSBs, psoralen monoadducts, or psoralen cross-links at the unique BsiWI site of phis3-622X were prepared in vitro and transformed into repair-proficient yeast cells for in vivo repair. Monoadducts were efficiently repaired, showing a transformation frequency of 60% relative to undamaged plasmids (Table I). DSBs were also fairly well repaired, with a relative transformation frequency of 45%. The repair efficiency of psoralen cross-links, at 20%, was lower than that of the monoadducts or DSBs. Both forms of double-strand damage induced plasmid integration, whereas psoralen monoadducts did not; DSBs induced higher levels of integration than cross-links (Table II). Double-strand damage also induced phenotypic changes to His+ and His– (Table III). His+ colonies are generated by gene conversion, but His– colonies can be produced by mutations as well as gene conversions. For DSBs, almost all the His– colonies were produced by gene conversion, but many of the cross-link-induced His– colonies were the result of mutations at the damage site rather than gene conversion (Table IV). Cross-links, thus, appear to be repaired by alternate pathways leading to either homologous recombination or mutations. We examined the repair products of DSB, psoralen monoadduct, and psoralen cross-link modification in yeast strains deficient in the NER, HR, or PRR pathways to characterize the contributions of each pathway to these recombinational and mutagenic endpoints. Nucleotide Excision Repair-deficient Strains—Psoralen monoadducts and cross-links are both acted on by the NER pathway in yeast; monoadducts yield single-strand breaks, whereas DSBs are produced in response to psoralen cross-links. That DSBs are effective inducers of homologous recombination leads to the prediction that psoralen cross-link-induced recombination should show dependence on NER. DNA damage-induced repair, recombination, and mutation were examined in yeast strains deficient in the NER genes RAD1, RAD3, RAD4, and RAD10. DSB repair efficiency was unaffected by loss of RAD3 or RAD4 function but was lower in rad1 and rad10 strains (Table I). Rad1 and Rad10 form a heterodimeric protein that makes the 5′ side incisions during the excision stage of NER (32Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Tomkinson A.E. Friedberg E.C.

To assess the importance of CPs for the growth and pathogenicity of the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica we have cultured amoebae in the presence of various cysteine proteinase inhibitors (CPIs). It was found that broad range CPIs, which are membrane permeable and rapidly enter the cell, are highly toxic at micromolar concentrations, and all attempts to generate E. histolytica mutants resistant to these CPIs were unsuccessful. In contrast, the broad range CPI E64, which does not permeate membranes as well, was deleterious at much higher concentrations, and amoebae rapidly developed resistance to this inhibitor. Compared with sensitive wild-type cells, E64-resistant E. histolytica were substantially reduced in the expression of various CP genes and were able to secrete unprocessed enzyme into the culture medium. Moreover, E64 resistance was associated with a significant reduction in virulence, because these cells were greatly impaired in the ability to generate liver abscesses in experimentally infected gerbils.

An attractive aspect of CPs is their widespread importance in the metabolism of all organisms studied so far. Accordingly, CPs have been considered as promising drug targets for the development of antiparasitic chemotherapy (3Cazzulo J.J. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2002; 2: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 4Caffrey C.R. Scory S. Steverding D. Curr.

During recent years, numerous studies have been performed to evaluate the antiparasitic effect of CP inhibitors (CPIs), which indicated that CPIs show indeed potent in vitro and in vivo growth inhibitory activity against various protozoans such as Plasmodium, Trypanosoma, or Leishmania species (6Bailly E.

The intestinal protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica, the causative agent of human amoebiasis is characterized by its high capacity to destroy host tissues, leading to potentially life-threatening diseases such as ulcerative colitis or liver abscess. E. histolytica is known to produce considerable amounts of CPs and convincing evidence exists that CPs are instrumental for E. histolytica-induced pathology. At least 20 cp genes exist in the E. histolytica genome. Interestingly, the majority of the various CPs are not expressed in E. histolytica trophozoites during in vitro cultivation. Northern blot analyses indicated that ehcp1, ehcp2, and ehcp5 showed the strongest expression of all proteinase genes leading to ∼90% of total cp transcripts (20Bruchhaus I. Loftus B.J. Hall N. Tannich E. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Treatment of amoebae with sublethal doses of the CPI E64 or the addition of laminin, which blocks the substrate-binding pocket of CPs, greatly reduced the ability to produce liver abscesses in laboratory animals (21Stanley Jr., S.L. Zhang T. Rubin D. Li E. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1587-1590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Li E. Yang W.G. Zhang T. Stanley Jr., S.L. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4150-4153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, liver abscess formation was totally blocked, and significantly less gut inflammation and damage to the intestinal permeability barrier were observed when animals were infected with amoebae, which were genetically engineered to produce low levels of CP activity (23Ankri S. Stolarsky T. Mirelman D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 24Ankri S. Stolarsky T. Bracha R. Padilla-Vaca F. Mirelman D. Infect.

For treatment of amoebic diseases, such as colitis or liver abscess, metronidazole is the drug of choice, which has been used in clinical practice for more than 25 years. At present, treatment of E. histolytica with metronidazole is still very effective but recently in vitro-induced metronidazole resistance of E. histolytica trophozoites has been reported (26Wassmann C. Hellberg A. Tannich E. Bruchhaus I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26051-26056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 27Samarawickrema N.A. Brown D.M. Upcroft J.A. Thammapalerd N. Upcroft P. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1997; 40: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition to drugs that are directed against amoebae that have invaded the tissue, there is need for more effective luminal anti-amoebic agents to eliminate the parasite from the intestine, which is important to interrupt transmission and to prevent E. histolytica carriers from progression into disease (28Blessmann J. Ali I.K. Nu P.A. Dinh B.Z. Viet T.Q. Van A.L. Clark C.G. Tannich E. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2003; 41: 4745-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 29Gathiram V. Jackson T.F. S. Afr. Med. J. 1987; 72: 669-672PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study indicated that the efficacy of the two drugs presently available for the treatment of E. histolytica carriers was only 87 and 57%, respectively (30Blessmann J. Tannich E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether E. histolytica CPs constitute suitable targets for the development of anti-amoebic drugs we have cultured the parasite in the presence of various CPIs and have characterized cells that are resistant to E64. Chemicals—For E. histolytica growth inhibition as well as inhibition of cysteine proteinase activity the CPIs E64 (l-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leu-4-guanidinobutylamide, Sigma), E64d (l-trans-epoxysuccinyl (OEt)-leu-3-methylbutylamide-ethyl ester, Sigma), Z-Phe-Ala-DMK (Z-Phe-Ala-diazomethylketone, Bachem), Z-Phe-Phe-DMK (Z-Phe-Phe-diazomethylketone, Bachem), and p-HMB (para-hydroxymercuribenzoate, Sigma) were used. Cultivation of Cells—Trophozoites of the E. histolytica isolate HM-1:IMSS were cultured axenically in TYI-S-33 medium in plastic culture flasks (31Diamond L.S. Harlow D.R. Cunnick C.C. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1978; 72: 431-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). The culture medium was changed every other day. If the amoebae were long term cultivated in the presence of E64, the inhibitor was re-supplied each time to the new culture medium. For cultivation of the amoebae in the presence of different CPIs and for generation of E64-resistant amoebae, 1000 or 2000 amoebae/well were cultivated in the presence of the respective CPI under anaerobic conditions using Anaerocult A (Merck) in a 96- or 24-well plate, respectively. For detection of secreted proteins in the culture supernatant, the amoebae were cultivated for 3 h in the presence of PBS (6.7 mm Na2HPO4, 3.3 mm NaH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) instead of TYI-S-33 medium. Trophozoites of cultures in the late logarithmic phase were harvested after being chilled on ice for 10 min and sedimented at 430 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The resulting pellet was washed twice either in PBS or in TYI-S-33 medium without serum. For preparation of soluble extracts of amoebae, cells were lysed by four freeze-thaw cycles in CO2/ethanol and sedimented by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Chinese hamster ovary cells were grown in RPMI 1640 in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin sulfate (199 μg/ml). Cells were released by trypsinization (0.05% trypsin, 0.02% sodium EDTA) and sedimented at 250 × g at room temperature for 3 min. Quantification of Viable Amoebae—1000 amoebae/well were cultivated in a 96-well plate in the presence of different CPIs. After different time points of cultivation the amoebae were washed two times with prewarmed PBS (37 °C) to remove dead cells. Subsequently, 10 μl of H2O was added to each well, and the plate was frozen at –70 °C for cell lysis. After thawing of the plates at room temperature, the amount of protein/well was determined using the BCA (Pierce) assay with bovine serum albumin (Pierce No. 23210) as standard. The growth relative to the control (amoebae cultivated without CPI) was determined. Northern Blot Analysis—Isolation of RNA from E. histolytica trophozoites was performed using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). For Northern blotting, agarose gels were loaded with 20 μg of total RNA. After transfer to a nylon membrane, the blots were sequentially hybridized with radiolabeled DNA probes obtained by restriction digest or PCR amplification of E. histolytica cysteine proteinases and the E. histolytica actin gene. Hybridizations were performed in 0.5 m Na2HPO4, 7% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.2) at 55 °C. Blots were washed in 40 mm Na2HPO4 and 1% SDS (pH 7.2) at 55 °C. Protein Analyses—12% SDS/PAGE was performed under reducing conditions. Western blot analyses were carried out by use of the semidry blotting technique with 10 mm CAPS, pH 11.0, 10% methanol as transfer buffer. For Western blot analyses, antibodies specific for EhCP1, EhCP2, and EhCP5 were used (32Jacobs T. Bruchhaus I. Dandekar T. Tannich E. Leippe M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 33Hellberg A. Leippe M. Bruchhaus I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA reagent and bovine serum albumin. Enzymatic Assays—Proteolytic activity was measured using the synthetic peptide Z-Arg-Arg-pNA (Bachem) as substrate (34Leippe M. Sievertsen H.J. Tannich E. Horstmann R.D. Parasitology. 1995; 111: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). One unit of enzymatic activity is defined as the amount that catalyzes the reduction of 1 μmol/min of p-nitroaniline. For detection of proteinase activity by substrate gel electrophoresis, a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel was copolymerized with 0.1% gelatin and subsequently treated as described (33Hellberg A. Leippe M. Bruchhaus I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Assay for Determination of Cytopathic Activity—Interaction of trophozoites and CHO cells was determined by a modified method of Bracha and Mirelman (35Bracha R. Mirelman D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). CHO cells (1 × 105) were grown to confluence in 24-well plates. After washing of the CHO cells with PBS, 1 × 105 trophozoites or cell extract were added in 800 μl of a serum-free mixture of RPMI 1640 and TYI-S-33 medium (5:3) to the cells. The amount of CHO cells that remained attached was proportional to the intensity of methylene blue staining. The amount of dye extracted from CHO monolayers that had not interacted with trophozoites served as controls (0% destruction of cell monolayer). Experiments were carried out at least in triplicate and were repeated twice. Transmission Electron Microscopy—For electron microscopy the trophozoites were first cryoimmobilized using the procedure of high pressure freezing of cell suspensions as described by Hohenberg et al. (36Hohenberg H. Mannweiler K. Muller M. J. Microsc. 1994; 175: 34-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). After high pressure freezing the frozen capillary tubes were freed from extraneous 1-hexadecene under liquid nitrogen. The samples were then transferred into precooled test tubes, filled with acetone containing 0.5% uranylic acid. Dehydration was carried out in a conventional freeze-solution unit (AFS, Leica Bensheim, Germany) at –90 °C for 8 h, followed by two substitution steps at –70 °C and –50 °C for 8 h. After freeze substitution the samples were infiltrated with Epon 812 (Fluka, Germany). The samples were washed in pure acetone for 30 min at –50 °C, infiltrated with 30% (v/v) Epon and 70% (v/v) acetone for 2 h at 4 °C, then infiltrated with 70% Epon and 30% acetone for 2 h at 4 °C, before finally four incubation steps were performed for 2 h each in pure Epon at room temperature. Polymerization was carried out at 60 °C for 24 h. Ultrathin sections contrasted with uranylacetate and lead citrate observed with a Zeiss EM 910 transmission electron microscope. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis, In-gel Digestion of Proteins and Mass Spectrometry—Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, in-gel digestion, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS), and data base analysis was performed as previously described (37Bente M. Harder S. Wiesgigl M. Heukeshoven J. Gelhaus C. Krause E. Clos J. Bruchhaus I. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 1811-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For each two-dimensional gel, 500 μg of soluble cell extract was used as sample. Induction of Amoebic Liver Abscesses in Gerbils—Gerbils were challenged with the direct hepatic inoculation of 1 × 106E. histolytica trophozoites according to the previously described methods (38Lotter H. Zhang T. Seydel K.B. Stanley Jr., S.L. Tannich E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Seven days later, animals were sacrificed, the liver was entirely removed and sectioned, and the weight of abscesses relative to the total liver weight was determined. Growth of E. histolytica Trophozoites in the Presence of Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors—In order to determine the growth characteristics of E. histolytica trophozoites in response to various CPI, amoebae were cultivated in the presence of different amounts of E64, E64d, Z-Phe-Ala-DMK, Z-Phe-Phe-DMK, and HMB, respectively. In contrast to the Z-Phe-Phe-DMK, which had almost no effect on amoeba growth, all other compounds inhibited growth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). For HMB as well as the membrane-permeable CPIs E64d and Z-Phe-Ala-DMK 10–20 μm were sufficient to kill all cells within 72 h. The nonmembrane-permeable CPI E64 was less potent as higher amounts of the drug were necessary to kill the cells. In the presence of 100 μm E64 nearly all amoebae died within 3 days (Fig. 1A). However, a small proportion of about 0.1% of cells was found to be resistant to this inhibitor. Resistant cells regularly multiplied and were able to survive in the presence of as much as 500 μm E64, although the doubling time decreased by about 50%. In the absence of E64, resistant cells revealed a similar growth curve as unselected wild-type amoebae. Resistance to E64 was a stable property, as culturing in the absence of E64 for up to at least 4 months did not substantially affect subsequent growth in the presence of the drug. Readdition of E64 revealed only a short delay of about 2–3 days until the cells started to multiply regularly and entering logarithmic growth phase (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, E64 resistance was not associated with resistance to other CPIs. Sensitivity to HMB, E64d, or Z-Phe-Ala-DMK was identical between E64-resistant and wild-type amoebae (Fig. 1A). Moreover, various attempts to generate E. histolytica trophozoites resistant to E64d, Z-Phe-Ala-DMK, or HMB were unsuccessful. Comparison of Cysteine Proteinase Expression in E64-sensitive and E64-resistant E. histolytica—Total CP activity in trophozoite lysates as determined by cleavage of the synthetic substrate Z-Arg-Arg-pNA was found to be identical in wild-type and E64-resistant cells. In the absence of E64, CP activities were about 200 milliunits/mg, whereas short term cultivation for a few hours in the presence of 50 μm E64 completely blocked CP activity in both wild-type and resistant cells. Time course experiments after removal of E64 from the culture revealed a constant increase of CP activity with full recovery after 72 h as determined by substrate gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). 2Previous findings indicate that the 35 and 48 kDa proteins correspond to EhCP2 and EhCP1, respectively (33Hellberg A. Leippe M. Bruchhaus I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). So far, it is not known which of the amoebic CPs are responsible for other activity bands. Previous studies have shown that under standard culture conditions E. histolytica trophozoites express three major CPs, namely EhCP1, EhCP2, and EhCP5, respectively, which all run in SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions as bands of ∼29 kDa (33Hellberg A. Leippe M. Bruchhaus I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis using antibodies specific to the various CPs revealed that cultivation in the presence of E64 increases the molecular mass by ∼5 kDa (Fig. 3). This was seen in E64-resistant as well as in wild-type amoebae. Separation of the higher molecular mass CPs by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and subsequent analysis of isolated proteins by MALDI-TOF/MS indicated that the three proteins represent unprocessed proforms of EhCP1, EhCP2, or EhCP5 (data not shown). In addition to protein analysis, RNA expression of the corresponding E. histolytica cp-genes was compared between wild-type and resistant amoebae cultivated in the presence or absence of E64. E64-sensitive wild-type cells were cultivated in the presence of 50 μm E64 for only 24 h, whereas E64-resistant amoebae were grown with the inhibitor for 7 days. Northern blot analysis indicated substantial more RNA of the various E. histolytica cp genes in E64-sensitive cells, irrespectively, whether grown in the presence or absence of E64. However, both resistant and sensitive amoebae showed an increase of cp1 and cp2 RNA when grown in the presence of E64, whereas cp5 RNA increased only in wild-type cells (Fig. 4). Secretion of Cysteine Proteinases—It has been previously demonstrated that E. histolytica trophozoites secrete cysteine proteinases into the culture medium (34Leippe M. Sievertsen H.J. Tannich E. Horstmann R.D. Parasitology. 1995; 111: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the amount of enzyme is limited and can be detected only by the use of sensitive activity assays but not by Western blots. However, when we developed Western blots from culture supernatants of E64-resistant cells, grown in the presence of E64, a specific band was found to react with anti-CP antibodies. This band corresponded to the band of unprocessed CPs in amoeba extracts (Fig. 5). In contrast, this band was not detected in culture supernatants of wild-type cells grown in the presence of E64 or in wild-type and E64-resistant cells grown without E64. The result suggests that the E64-resistant phenotype is able to secrete substantial amounts of unprocessed cysteine proteinases. Ultrastructure of E. histolytica Cultivated in the Presence of E64—E64-resistant and -sensitive amoebae were subjected to electron microscopy for ultrastructural analysis. In the presence of E64 both types of cells showed a massive network of fibrillae-like structures located in the cytoplasm, which was not observed in trophozoites cultivated in the absence of E64 (Fig. 6). These structures were obviously devoid of actin, as they did not react with antibodies, which were able to detect E. histolytica G- or F-actin (data not shown). E64 and Cytopathic Activity—E. histolytica trophozoites or trophozoite lysates are able to disrupt monolayers of cultured mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. This phenomenon, called the cytopathic effect, can be blocked by preincubation with E64 (39Hellberg A. Nickel R. Lotter H. Tannich E. Bruchhaus I. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Comparison between wild-type and E64-resistant amoebae in the presence or absence of E64 revealed no differences in cytopathic activity (Fig. 7A). In the absence of E64 both types of cells disrupted about 75% of a CHO cell monolayer within 1 h, whereas preincubation of amoeba with E64 reduced the cytopathic effect to about 15%. Similar results were obtained with corresponding trophozoite lysates (Fig. 7B). Amoebic Liver Abscess Formation in the Presence of E64— Previous studies have shown that E. histolytica cysteine proteinases play a major role for the development of amoeba-induced liver abscesses in experimentally infected rodents. Accordingly, we have analyzed whether preincubation of amoeba with E64 or E64-resistance has any influence on abscess formation. Groups of gerbils consisting of 8 animals each were challenged either with wild-type amoebae cultured for 24 h or with E64-resistant cells cultivated for 7 days in the presence of 50 μm of E64. As controls, groups of animals were challenged either with wild-type or with E64-resistant amoebae cultured without E64. Wild-type and E64-resistant controls induced liver abscesses in 8 of 8 and 5 of 8 gerbils, respectively, whereas the same cells cultured in the presence of E64 revealed abscess formation in 6 of 8 and 1 of 8 animals, respectively. Thus, only the group of gerbils, which was infected with E64-resistant amoebae, cultured in the presence of E64, had significant fewer abscesses (p < 0.02). However, compared with the wild-type control group, sizes of abscesses in animals, which were not completely protected, were significantly smaller when challenged with E64-resistant cells (p < 0.05) or with wild-type cells cultured in the presence of E64 (p < 0.001) (Table I).Table ILiver abscess formation in gerbils challenged with Entamoeba histolyticaAmoebic populationNo. of gerbils with abscess/no of gerbils challengedPercent liver abscessed in nonprotected gerbilsWT8/87.53 ± 3.65WT + E64aCultured in the presence of 50 μm of E64 for 24 hr.6/81.82 ± 1.07 (p<0.001)bCompared to WT.,cp values were determined by paired Student's t test.E64r5/82.96 ± 2.25 (p< 0.05)bCompared to WT.,cp values were determined by paired Student's t test.E64r + E64dCultured in the presence of 50 μm of E64 for 7 days.1/8 (p < 0.02)cp values were determined by paired Student's t test.,eCompared to WT+E64.1.38a Cultured in the presence of 50 μm of E64 for 24 hr.b Compared to WT.c p values were determined by paired Student's t test.d Cultured in the presence of 50 μm of E64 for 7 days.e Compared to WT+E64. Open table in a new tab Cysteine proteinases have been shown to constitute major pathogenicity factors of E. histolytica and are considered as suitable targets for antiparasitic drugs. However, present knowledge regarding the significance of the various CPs for E. histolytica growth, pathogenicity or the parasite life cycle is still fragmentary. In an attempt to further elucidate the importance of CPs, we have grown E. histolytica trophozoites in the presence of different inhibitors. The results clearly demonstrate that broad range CPIs, which rapidly enter the cell, are deleterious for the parasite at least under axenic culture conditions. In contrast, one membrane-permeable cysteine proteinase inhibitor Z-Phe-Phe-DMK has nearly no effect on E. histolytica growth. Like the potent amoebic growth inhibitor Z-Phe-Ala-DMK, Z-Phe-Phe-DMK belongs to the diazomethylketones, which are described as potent CPIs. It is also described that Z-Phe-Ala-DMK was a much more potent inhibitor for Cathepsin L and B like enzymes in comparison to Z-Phe-Phe-DMK. In contrast, Z-Phe-Phe-DMK is a very poor inhibitor of cathepsin B but is a better inhibitor of cathepsin L than is Z-Phe-Ala-DMK (40Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar, 41Green G.D. Shaw E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1923-1928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies using amoebic extracts confirm these data. The main expressed proteinases EhCP1, EhCP2 and EhCP5 exhibit cathepsin B like activity (32Jacobs T. Bruchhaus I. Dandekar T. Tannich E. Leippe M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 42Luaces A.L. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 43Scholze H. Schulte W. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1988; 47: 115-123PubMed Google Scholar), and our results indicate that Z-Phe-Ala-DMK is a 50-fold more potent inhibitor than is Z-Phe-Phe-DMK (data not shown). Therefore it is no surprise that Z-Phe-Ala-DMK has an influence on the growth of E. histolytica, whereas the Z-Phe-Phe-DMK has not. Moreover, all attempts to select amoebae resistant to these highly potent inhibitors were unsuccessful indicating the importance of CPs for parasite growth and further supporting the concept of the use of CPs as targets for the development of antiamoebic drugs. However, it remains to be determined whether indeed a large number of the various E. histolytica CPs or only a few or a specific subset have to be targeted to inhibit amoeba growth. At least down-regulation of EhCP5 as previously performed by antisense technology, which resulted in a 90% reduction of total CP activity, did not affect amoeba growth in vitro but cells were impaired in their ability to induce amoebic liver abscess in rodents (24Ankri S. Stolarsky T. Bracha R. Padilla-Vaca F. Mirelman D. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 421-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the various highly potent compounds including E64d, E64 was less toxic and inhibited amoeba growth only at 10-fold higher concentrations. Compared with E64d, E64 has the same substrate specificity, but does not effectively penetrate membranes (44Wilcox D. Mason R.W. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, E64 can be taken up by the parasite via pinocytosis. Thus, it may primarily act against surface-bound CPs as well as against enzymes located in phagolysosomes, but may be less effective against CPs that are active at other destinations within the cell including those involved in protein trimming and maturation processes. The latter function of CPs is likely to be of critical importance for amoeba growth and may explain the high toxicity of CPIs that rapidly penetrate membranes. Another interesting result of this study was the finding that E. histolytica trophozoites are able to counteract the toxic effect of E64 by developing resistance to this compound. E64-resistance was a stable property and was maintained even after growing of the parasite for several months in the absence of the drug. Thus, the mechanism of resistance differs from that recently reported for metronidazole, as in vitro-induced resistance of E. histolytica to metronidazole was rapidly lost after a few passages (26Wassmann C. Hellberg A. Tannich E. Bruchhaus I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26051-26056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 27Samarawickrema N.A. Brown D.M. Upcroft J.A. Thammapalerd N. Upcroft P. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1997; 40: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A number of different mechanisms responsible for drug resistance in protozoan parasites have been identified in recent years (45Borst P. Ouellette M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 427-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 46Cowman A.F. Aust. N. Z. J. Med. 1995; 25: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 47Barrett M.P. Fairlamb A.H.

Drug Targets. 2002; 3: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), including those decreasing the influx or accelerating the efflux of therapeutic agents. Although we do not know at present the mechanism that is operational for E64-resistance in Entamoeba, it is less likely that the reduction of the drug load is of importance, as we did not find any differences in time course and degree of CP inhibition by E64 between wild-type and resistant cells. The mode of action of CPIs has been studied in considerable detail in Trypanosoma cruzi. It was suggested that the lethal effect of CPIs to this protozoan parasite was due to interruption of the autocatalytic processing of proteinases, leading to their accumulation in the Golgi complex and subsequent disruption of trafficking and processing of glycoproteins in the parasite (14Engel J.C. Doyle P.S. Palmer J. Hsieh I. Bainton D.F. McKerrow J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 597-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T. cruzi made resistant to CPIs showed up-regulation of the secretory pathway, and ultrastructural studies revealed a marked increase in the number of vesicles trafficking from the Golgi complex to the flagellar pocket, the side of protein excretion in trypanosomes. Moreover, in resistant cells, the main cysteine proteinase, cruzain, which is usually targeted to lysosomes, was found to be localized within the lumen of and in vesicles proximal to the flagellar pocket and was secreted as unprocessed, inactive proform (49Engel J.C. Torres C. Hsieh I. Doyle P.S. McKerrow J.H. Garcia C.T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1345-1354PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, autocatalytic processing of CPs was inhibited in E. histolytica trophozoites challenged with E64- and E64-resistant amoebae were found to secrete substantial amounts of unprocessed enzyme. On the other hand, E64-resistance of E. histolytica differed in several aspects from CPI-resistance of T. cruzi. E64-resistant amoebae could be rapidly selected from standard cultures but revealed no cross-resistance to other CPIs. In contrast, induction of resistance in T. cruzi required more than 1 year of selection increasing the drug stepwise and resistant cells were cross-resistant to at least another 4 different CPIs (49Engel J.C. Torres C. Hsieh I. Doyle P.S. McKerrow J.H. Garcia C.T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1345-1354PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, ultrastructural analysis of E64-resistant amoebae did not reveal a marked increase in the contents of vesicle. However, Entamoeba trophozoites contain an extraordinary high number of vesicles. Thus, more detailed studies are required until a final conclusion can be made whether the number of excretory vesicles has been changed in resistant cells. The only obvious ultrastructural change that became visible upon challenge with E64 was the occurrence of a massive network of fibrillae-like structures located in the cytoplasm of the cells. These structures did not contain actin but may consist of tubulin and might constitute as response to stress as they were found not only in E64-resistant and but also in E64-sensitive amoebae when grown in the presence of the inhibitor. One of the main differences between wild-type and E64-resistant E. histolytica was a substantial impairment of resistant amoebae to induce liver abscesses in laboratory animals. In agreement with previous findings (21Stanley Jr., S.L. Zhang T. Rubin D. Li E. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1587-1590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), preincubation of sensitive cells with E64 did not completely block liver abscess formation but compared with respective controls abscesses were significantly smaller. In contrast, sizes of abscesses were significantly reduced in E64-resistant cells even in the absence of E64 and liver abscess formation was completely blocked in 7 of 8 animals when infected with E64-resistant amoebae grown in the presence of the inhibitor. The reduced virulence of E64-resistant amoebae might be linked to the observed decreased expression of the various ehcp genes (Fig. 4). In particular the strong reduction of ehcp5-RNA together with a loss of a regular response in the presence of E64 might be of importance. Increasing evidence suggests that EhCP5 plays a critically role for E. histolytica pathogenicity. The molecule is present on the surface of the amoeba and activates inflammatory cytokines (25Zhang Z.

Leippe M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a corresponding enzyme is absent in the closely related, nonpathogenic species Entamoeba dispar (50Bruchhaus I. Jacobs T. Leippe M. Tannich E. Mol.

Moreover, E. histolytica with down-regulated EhCP5 by ehcp5 antisense-RNA were unable to induce liver abscesses in hamsters and showed less gut inflammation in mice (24Ankri S. Stolarsky T. Bracha R.

Modification of the small insertion in neuronal NOS tends to increase cytochrome c reduction but not NO synthetic activity; some modifications or deletions in the corresponding region in endothelial NOS modestly increase activity under some conditions. Unexpectedly, some minor changes in the sequence introduce a loss in the content of heme relative to flavin cofactors.

NADPH has been shown to be involved in producing a “conformational lock” in rapid kinetics experiments (30Craig D.H. Chapman S.K. Daff S. J. Biol.

E. Smith, R. Jones, and J. C. Salerno, unpublished data, Two additional regions contain sequence elements that correlate with Ca2+/CaM control. The strap connecting the FAD and FMN binding domains is slightly longer in cNOS, which may provide additional conformational flexibility. Of greater interest is the small insertion (SI) consisting of four to seven residues in the hinge subdomain contained within the FAD binding region. This sequence element has recently been shown to form a β hairpin adjacent to the AI and to the CaM binding site in the first structure of nNOS reductase domains (31Zhang J. Martasek P. Paschke R. Shea T. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37506-37513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). There is, however, no homology at the amino acid level between the SIs of eNOS and nNOS; homology was destroyed by coupled frameshift mutations, which were tolerated despite completely changing the character of the sequence. Most recently, deletion of the SI in eNOS by substitution of the corresponding iNOS region produced an enzyme activated at 5-fold lower Ca2+, leading to a proposal that the SI functions as an additional AI element (32Knudsen G.M. Nishida C.R. Mooney S.D. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31814-31824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The –SI enzyme is not more active than the wild type enzyme under all conditions, however, and does not follow the pattern observed on AI deletion/substitution. These conflicting indications concerning the importance of the region are addressed here by a series of mutagenesis experiments. Materials—All chemicals used for purification were obtained from Sigma. The genes for eNOS and nNOS were gifts from Professor B. S. S. Masters (University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio). The iNOS expression system was the gift of Professor Dipak Ghosh (Duke University and VA Medical Center). GroELS plasmid was provided by Dr. Anthony Gatenby (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Expression and Purification of Wild Type and Mutant Bovine eNOS and Rat nNOS—Expression and purification of bovine eNOS and rat nNOS were performed using procedures similar to those described previously (33Martasek P. Liu Q. Liu J. Roman L.J. Gross S.S. Sessa W.C. Masters B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Transformed cells were broken with a French press, and after centrifugation to remove cell debris the supernatant was loaded on a 2′,5′-ADP affinity column, washed, and eluted with 2′-AMP as in the previous paper (33Martasek P. Liu Q. Liu J. Roman L.J. Gross S.S. Sessa W.C. Masters B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). High purity preparations can be obtained with a size exclusion step; we used a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences); flow rate, 0.4 ml/min; buffer composition, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v). During the purification procedure tetrahydrobiopterin or l-arginine was added after elution from the affinity column. Enzyme sample concentrations were determined on the basis of heme concentration, except in heme-free preparations, where the flavin concentration was measured. UV-visible absorbance spectra were recorded on an Aminco DW-2000 spectrophotometer. NO production was assayed using the Griess assay as adapted for microtiter plates (34Gross S.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 159-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); calcium dependence was measured using EDTA asaCa2+ buffer system. NO production by NOS isoforms was routinely assayed with different buffering systems because eNOS is much more active in MOPS, whereas iNOS and nNOS work well in Tris. NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reduction was measured spectrophotometrically as described by McMillan et al. (17McMillan K. Bredt D.S. Hirsch D.J. Snyder S.H. Clark J.E. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11141-11145Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), adapted to 96-well plate microtiter plates. In each well, the 500-μl reaction mixture contained 50 mm Na+/Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 50 μm EDTA, 50 μm NADPH, 50 μm horse heart cytochrome c, and ∼10 nm nNOS. Cytochrome c reduction was monitored at 550 nm (ϵ = 2.1 × 104/m). In Ca2+/CaM dependence studies, 0.75 μm CaCl2 and 10 pg/ml CaM were added to reaction mixtures. Assays were performed on a SpectraMAX plate reader (Molecular Devices). Protein concentrations were estimated by several methods. The Bio-Rad DC protein kit, an adaptation of the method of Lowry et al. (35Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), provided the primary measurements; a correction for tyrosine and tryptophan content was applied. Holoenzyme and reductase domain extinction coefficients at 280 nm, given under “Results,” were similar to those calculated for unfolded proteins from the sequences at the Expasy web site using the ProtParam tool. Generation of NOS Mutants—NOS genes in pCWori+ were mutated using a method we devised employing the Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis kit. As suggested by Wang and Malcolm (36Wang W.Y. Malcolm B.A. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), we began by separating the forward and reverse primers, but instead of a single preliminary step with separate primers followed by reversion to the Stratagene protocol, we employ 25 cycles of linear amplification with no additional steps other than to combine and anneal the samples. The removal of the “PCR” steps, which are unproductive and which actually destroy mutant strands by extension, removes the limitations on the separate linear amplification steps and greatly improves the performance of the procedure. In particular, we have obtained a consistent high yield of mutants and a very low background (<5%) of parentals. A more detailed evaluation of the method will be published elsewhere. After mutagenesis, the products were used to transform XL10-Gold Ultracompetent Escherichia coli cells from Stratagene. Transformed cells were selected by growth on ampicillin medium; clonal colonies were cultured, and plasmid DNA was obtained using Qiagen minipreparation kits. Mutants were sequenced at the State University of New York at Albany Center for Functional Genomics sequencing facility. An alignment of the SI region in eNOS, nNOS, iNOS, and NADPH P450 oxidoreductase is shown in Fig. 1. These sequences are part of the hinge subdomain within the FAD binding domain. Alignments of two dozen eukaryotic NOS sequences (not shown for reasons of space) indicate that corresponding SIs are a feature of other NOS sequences that contain AI cognates in the FMN binding domain; iNOSs lack this feature. The SI regions of constitutive NOS isoforms of primitive vertebrates and invertebrates resemble nNOS more closely than eNOS. The SI in mammalian nNOS is characterized by its hydrophobic character and by a glycine residue that marks a turning point in the path of the backbone. It can be argued that a centrally located glycine (or glycines) allowing a sharp turn is the only common SI sequence element. To examine the significance of this residue we constructed several mutants. We reasoned that the standard alanine mutant would not be particularly informative in this case because Gly and Ala both have small side chains associated with sharp turns. Tyr and Asp were selected as residues that would introduce strongly different character into the region, Tyr by virtue of its large side chain volume and Asp by introducing a negative charge into a hydrophobic region. We preferred the relatively short side chain of acidic residues to the very long positively charged side chains of Arg and Lys, both of which are capable of interacting over a considerable distance. Mutants of nNOS—The structure of the nNOS region can be seen in Fig. 2, in which the structure of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (38Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Kim J.J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) is overlaid with the structure of a two-domain nNOS construct, including the FAD and NADPH binding domains and the hinge subdomain (31Zhang J. Martasek P. Paschke R. Shea T. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37506-37513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The SI is shown in white; it is adjacent to the edge of the FMN binding domain opposite the FMN binding site and is directly adjacent to bound CaM and the AI. In nNOS the sequence immediately preceding the SI contains the triplet LEE, corresponding to LDE in iNOS and NADPH P450 oxidoreductase and LEK in eNOS. The second acidic residue in the figure, corresponding to Glu-352 in NADPH P450 oxidoreductase and Glu-1068 in rat nNOS, is marked in deep red in both cases. Immediately after the SI is a triplet NKK in NADPH P450 reductase and NWK in nNOS. The serine residues, Ser-354 and Ser-1077 in NADPH P450 oxidoreductase and nNOS respectively, are marked in Fig. 2 in yellow. This makes the relative positions of cognate structures (e.g. the AI and CaM binding site) surrounding the SI region in the two proteins clear. In designing deletion mutants we were influenced by the pattern observed in large multiple sequence alignments of NOS isoforms, by the structures of P450 reductase and nNOS reductase domains shown in Fig. 2, and by structural models of the NOS reductase domains we have constructed over the past 10 years using information from these and other solved homologous proteins (e.g.22Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.J. Smith S.M. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29769-29777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In P450 oxidoreductase the motif LDEES (see Fig. 1) forms the turn at the end of a series of β pair structures; this is probably approximated in iNOS by the cognate sequence LDESGS. The insertion of six or seven residues relative to iNOS or P450 reductase causes the corresponding sequence element to assume a different position; it now forms one side of a terminal β hairpin structure. Removal of the entire insertion (corresponding to within one residue to TALGVIS in nNOS and PGGPPP in eNOS) should cause a reversion to the P450 reductase-like structure if this is consistent with the structural context. Partial deletions should cause shortening of the β hairpin with potential disruption of the local geometry because the shorter sequence cannot make the same turn as the wild type parent. Note the large difference in structure between the flanking homologous regions in the two structures overlaid in Fig. 2; this might have less to do with the insertion than with the differences in structurally adjacent regions in the two enzymes shown and with the absence of the FMN binding domain in the nNOS structure. Fig. 3A shows optical spectra of preparations (partially purified by 2′,5′-ADP affinity chromatography) of the G1074Y and G1074D rat nNOS mutants as well as wild type enzyme. G1074Y has an abnormal absorbance spectrum reflecting a heme:flavin ratio of 1:4 rather than the 1:2 ratio of wild type enzyme, whereas the spectrum of G1074D closely resembles that of wild type nNOS. This is most obvious from the relative size of the heme Soret band near 410 nm, indicative of a mixture of high spin and low spin ferriheme, and the bands near 480 nm from FAD and FMN. We have confirmed the loss of heme by decomposition of the spectra into heme and flavin components. This unusual and somewhat counterintuitive result implies that a mutation in the reductase domains reduced the heme content while leaving the flavin content relatively unchanged. CO difference spectra (not shown) indicate that the ferrous CO complex of the remaining heme has its Soret maximum at 447 nm, indicating that the heme still has its native axial thiolate ligand; little conversion to the denatured P420′ form has occurred. This indicates that the remaining heme is located in correctly folded oxygenase domains. Further purification by gel filtration of nNOS constructs which express significantly as holoenzyme resulted in preparations with UV-visible spectra very similar to wild type nNOS; yields were comparable for G1074D and low (about one-quarter normal) for G1074Y. Protein concentrations were measured by several methods. The mm–1 extinction coefficients at 280 nm were 175 for nNOS holoenzyme and 70 for the reductase domain from assays for tetrahydrobiopterin-free preparations or for spectra from which the biopterin contribution had been subtracted, which agreed surprisingly well with calculations based on the content of aromatics. As shown in Table I, mutants that express significantly as holoenzyme have close to one heme/monomer. G1074Y has slightly lower heme content even in preparations that have been further purified by gel filtration. Because all of the nNOS mutants have nearly a full complement of flavin cofactors, very few oxygenase sites are associated with flavin-deficient reductase units, and the measured activities do not reflect trivial effects based on flavin content.Table ISome properties of nNOS mutants expressed in ER2566 cells and partially purified using 2′,5′-ADP affinity chromatographyEnzymeHeme:flavin ratioNitrite productionHeme content/monomernmol/min/mg NOSWild type nNOS1:1.9292.20.9G1074D mutant1:2.1179.80.9G1074Y mutant1:4.0(a)186.20.65(c)1:3.2(b)TAL deletion mutant1:2.4(a)312.30.8 (c)1:2.1(b) Open table in a new tab The effects on enzyme activity and Ca2+/CaM control of G1074Y and G1074D nNOS mutations were similar. Although the SI appears well placed to interact with the CaM binding region, the calcium dependence of activation is unchanged. However, the NO synthase activity of both mutants, based on heme content as measured at 447 nm in the CO difference spectrum, is only about two-thirds that of the wild type enzyme on a per heme basis. The activities of the mutants are summarized in Table I. Deletion of half of the SI (TAL corresponding to 1071–1073 in nNOS) produced an effect on the spectral properties of the expressed protein analogous to the substitution of Tyr for Gly; in this case the heme:flavin ratio is reduced only to about 1:2.4 (Table I) (spectrum not shown). The calcium dependence was unaltered. Unlike the Tyr mutant, this mutant had wild type activity on a per heme basis. Deletion of the entire SI produced a spectrally similar nNOS mutant with low activity on a per heme basis. Cytochrome c reduction by NOS isoforms has been assumed to occur primarily through FMN; recently conducted experiments with an nNOS shielding residue mutant lacking FMN support this view.2 Cytochrome c reduction is therefore a measure of electron transfer through the reductase domains, which does not require the oxygenase component. It is activated by CaM binding but does not strictly correlate with NO production. The cytochrome c reduction experiments presented here correspond to the low salt experiments of Knudsen et al. (32Knudsen G.M. Nishida C.R. Mooney S.D. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31814-31824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). eNOS wild type and mutant activity depends on salt concentration and type and on the buffer used in assays; we hope to present additional experiments at a later date to clarify this area. The effects of SI mutations on cytochrome c reduction rates in nNOS are shown in Fig. 4. The G1074Y mutant has a slightly reduced rate of cytochrome c reduction consistent with its lower rate of NO production. This is also true of the half-deletion mutant. This suggests that the low rate of NO production is the result of slow electron delivery. The enhancement of cytochrome c reduction by CaM is comparable (about 5-fold) in wild type nNOS and all mutants except the full SI deletion, which has very low cytochrome c reduction activity. This is in sharp contrast to AI mutants, which tend to lose CaM sensitivity (e.g.23.Salerno, J. C. (July 12, 1996) U. S. Patent 6,150,500Google Scholar). The G1074D mutant and the 1171–1173 deletion mutants are significantly more active than the wild type enzyme in cytochrome c reduction. Mutants of eNOS—In contrast to nNOS, the SI in eNOS consists entirely of proline and glycine residues unless the flanking residue serine 838 is considered. The eNOS SI was less tolerant of mutations than the nNOS SI, probably because of rigidity imposed by the prolines. In general, 20% of wild type expression levels would produce more than enough enzyme for the purposes of this paper, but most of the mutants produced only about 10% heme-containing protein as judged by the small peak in the Soret region; we could detect no CO difference spectra in these preparations at 450 nm (cysteinyl ligand intact) or 420 nm (denatured form). The Gly-841 deletion mutant, however, was expressed at only slightly lower levels than wild type eNOS (50–60%). UV-visible absorbance spectra of preparations partially purified by 2′,5′ affinity chromatography suggested a slightly depressed heme:flavin ratio but were otherwise normal. The Ca2+/CaM dependence of this mutant is unaltered compared with wild type eNOS. The activity/heme is slightly lower in the fully activated state (85% of wild type), which is within the variability of the activity of wild type preparations. Neither the G841Y nor G841E mutant of bovine eNOS was significantly expressed as a heme protein, in contrast to their nNOS cognates. The lower heme:flavin ratio observed in G1074Y rat nNOS was reflected in an exaggerated form in the eNOS mutants, which could be partially purified as flavoproteins on a 2′,5′-ADP column. The optical spectra of these preparations are compared with wild type eNOS in Fig. 3B. The reductase domains of these mutants are obviously inactive in NO production, but they exhibit uncoupled NADPH oxidation (based on NADPH oxidation by O2 during Griess assays; data not shown) at two to three times the rate of wild type eNOS. When further purified by gel filtration, the spectra of the Gly-841 deletion mutant closely resembled wild type enzyme. We calculated a minimum heme:monomer ratio of 0.5–0.6 assuming 100% purity; the extinction coefficients of ∼150 and 75 for eNOS holoenzyme and reductase domain agree well with expected values based on aromatic contents, subject to interference by tetrahydrobiopterin. The flavin content of affinity-purified preparations was about 1.7 flavins/heme. Mutants that did not express significantly as holoenzyme could be partially purified by affinity chromatography followed by gel exclusion. Total flavin:monomer ratio ranged from 0.5 to 1 assuming 100% purity. The activities and spectra of these constructs indicate that most of the flavin is present in molecules with one FMN and one FAD. As mentioned previously, Knudsen et al. (32Knudsen G.M. Nishida C.R. Mooney S.D. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31814-31824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) reported the effects of SI deletion in eNOS; calcium dependence was affected, but neither the cytochrome c nor the NO production activities were significantly affected, apart from a modest change in salt dependence. The eNOS mutants produced here (except for the Gly-841 deletion, which is similar to wild type) are CaM-insensitive in all assays, but this may result from exposure of the CaM binding site to proteolysis ra"

We demonstrate that this inhibitory effect is due to down-regulation of the full-length Mpl protein. The C terminus of Mpl-tr, consisting of 30 amino acids of unique sequence, is essential for the suppression of thrombopoietin-dependent proliferation and Mpl protein down-regulation. Cathepsin inhibitor-1 (CATI-1), an inhibitor of cathepsin-like cysteine proteases, counteracts the effect of Mpl-tr on Mpl protein expression, suggesting that Mpl-tr targets Mpl for lysosomal degradation.

Cytokine receptor signaling has profound effects on cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation of the receiving cell (1Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that components of the signaling cascade are tightly regulated at several levels. An important mechanism for controlling gene expression is alternative splicing, allowing the synthesis of structurally and functionally distinct protein isoforms (2Roberts G.C. Smith C.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 6: 375-383Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Many alternative splice variants of different cytokine receptors have been described, but the function of most of the resulting protein isoforms remains unknown. Cytokine receptor isoforms may be classified according to the presence or absence of a transmembrane domain. Isoforms lacking a transmembrane domain are often termed “soluble cytokine receptors” and can fulfill different physiological functions (3Heaney M.L. Golde D.W.

In general, soluble receptors may function as agonists by stabilizing their ligands, e.g. growth hormone and tumor necrosis factor (5Veldhuis J.D. Johnson M.L. Faunt L.M. Mercado M. Baumann G. J.

Dower S.K. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4766-4774PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble receptors can arise from alternative splicing or from proteolytic receptor shedding on the cell surface. Isoforms generated by alternative splicing often contain additional protein sequence due to unspliced intron sequence and/or a shift of the reading frame. Generally, no biological function has been attributed to these additional stretches of amino acids. Thrombopoietin (TPO) and its receptor “cellular homolog of myeloproliferative leukemia” (c-Mpl) are the primary regulators of megakaryopoiesis (9Kaushansky K. Drachman J.G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3359-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The c-mpl gene is composed of 12 exons (see Fig. 1A) (10Mignotte V. Vigon I. Boucher de Crevecoeur E. Romeo P.H. Lemarchandel V. Chretien S. Genomics. 1994; 20: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the mouse, two distinct alternate mRNA isoforms are known. The transmembrane variant mpl-II is due to usage of a cryptic splice acceptor in exon 4 resulting in an in-frame deletion of 60 amino acids (11Sabath D.F. Lofton-Day C. Lin N. Lok S. Kaushansky K. Broudy V.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1574: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). No function has yet been assigned to this isoform. The second mRNA variant encodes a truncated soluble receptor, Mpl-tr, and is the only one found both in human and mouse. This variant results from splicing of exon 8 directly to exon 11, eliminating the juxtamembrane extracellular part and the transmembrane domain (12Skoda R.C. Seldin D.C. Chiang M.K. Peichel C.L.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2607-2615PubMed Google Scholar). Due to an altered reading frame at the splice acceptor site of exon 11, Mpl-tr protein terminates in a short stretch of novel amino acid sequences (see Fig. 1). mpl-tr mRNA accounts for ∼30% of mpl mRNA in mouse spleen (12Skoda R.C.

Despite the presence of a signal sequence and the lack of a transmembrane domain, Mpl-tr is not secreted into the cell supernatant when ectopically expressed in cell line (12Skoda R.C. Seldin D.C. Chiang M.K. Peichel C.L. Vogt T.F. Leder P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2645-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In humans, two alternate mRNA mpl species are known in addition to mpl-tr. The mpl-K variant is due to a readthrough beyond the exon 10 splice donor site (14Vigon I. Mornon J.P. Cocault L. Mitjavila M.T. Tambourin P. Gisselbrecht S. Souyri M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5640-5644Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The resulting K-form of the receptor diverges from the native sequence after the ninth cytoplasmic amino acid and terminates within intron 10. mpl-del, a second isoform, arises as a consequence of alternative splicing between exons 8 and 9 and encodes a protein with an in-frame deletion of 24 amino acids and unknown function (15Li J. Sabath D.F. Kuter D.J. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because of the lack of secretion of Mpl-tr, we analyzed whether Mpl-tr plays a physiological role intracellularly. Here, we demonstrate that Mpl-tr specifically inhibits TPO-dependent proliferation and survival. We show that Mpl-tr is responsible for initiating protein down-regulation of the full-length Mpl receptor by a cathepsin-like cysteine protease activity. As a consequence, the amount of total Mpl protein in the cell is drastically reduced. Further, our data show that for this effect, a short peptide sequence at the C terminus of Mpl-tr is essential. The ability of Mpl-tr to antagonize Mpl function represents a novel mechanism by which cytokine signaling is regulated. DNA Constructs—The plasmid pCD4 (pMICD4) is a gift from Dr. Harvey A. Lodish. It contains an internal ribosomal entry site followed by a truncated cDNA of the human CD4 gene and is derived from the retroviral expression vector pMX (16Liu X. Constantinescu S.N. Sun Y. Bogan J.S. Hirsch D. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To generate pCD4-mpl-tr, mpl-tr was cloned into the restriction sites XhoI and blunted BamHI of the multiple cloning site of pCD4. For the generation of the mpl-tr mutants, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The following primers were used: 5′-GAAGGCCGTGAGGACTGGAAGTAGACTGAGGCAAGCTTTGTGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCACAAAGCTTGCCTCAGTCTACTTCCAGTCCTCACGGCCTTC-3′ (antisense) for the stop codon in Δpep30; 5′-GAAGGCCGTGAGGACTGGAAGAGACTGAGGCAAGCTTTGTGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCACAAAGCTTGCCTCAGTCTCTTCCAGTCCTCACGGCCTTC-3′ (antisense) for the frameshift in tr-pepmpl; 5′-GCCCTAAGTCCTTCTTAAGGCCACGGTTACCGATAGCTGTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CACAGCTATCGGTAACCGTGGCCTTAAGAAGGACTTAGGGC-3′ (antisense) for the stop codon in tr-pepmpl. mpl, mpl-tr, and pep30 cDNAs were cloned into the 5Myc-pcDNA1 vector (gift from Dr. Eva Reinhard, Biozentrum, University of Basel), which contains at its 5′ end a sequence encoding a hemagglutinin signal sequence followed by five Myc epitopes (17Bormann P. Roth L.W. Andel D. Ackermann M. Reinhard E. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1999; 13: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For stable transfections, Myc-tagged mpl cDNA was cloned into the pGD expression vector (18Daley G.Q. Van Etten R.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1990; 247: 824-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar) as a XhoI-NotI fragment. For transient transfections into human kidney 293T cells, mouse mpl, Myc-mpl, and mpl-tr cDNAs were subcloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) as XhoI-NotI fragments. Cell Transfection and Culture—BaF3 cells (19Palacios R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) were cultured as described (20Stoffel R. Wiestner A. Skoda R.C. Blood. 1996; 87: 567-573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). UT-7 cells (21Komatsu N. Nakauchi H. Miwa A. Ishihara T. Eguchi M. Moroi M. Okada M. Sato Y. Wada H. Yawata Y. Suda T. Miura Y. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 341-348PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 ng/ml recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulatory factor (GM-CSF) (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany). For transfections of BaF3 and UT-7 cells, 0.5–1 × 107 cells were electroporated at 270 V and 975 microfarads at ambient temperature in the presence of 20 μg of plasmid. UT-7/Myc-mpl cells were cultured in the presence of 450 μg/ml G418. A pool of stably transfected UT-7/Myc-mpl cells was used for the transfection with different pCD4 constructs. The BaF3/mpl cell clone TM17, which has been described (20Stoffel R. Wiestner A. Skoda R.C. Blood. 1996; 87: 567-573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used for transfections with different pCD4 constructs. Cells expressing human CD4 were selected by the usage of anti-CD4 microbeads according to the manufacturer's protocol (Miltenyi, Auburn, CA). mpl-tr conditioned medium was obtained from UT-7 cells expressing pCD4-mpl-tr, which were cultured at exponential growth phase in human GM-CSF for 2 days. Control medium was harvested from untransfected UT-7 cells. For transient transfections of 293T cells, the transfection reagent FuGENE was used according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). Where indicated, protease inhibitors (Calbiochem) were added at a final concentration of 25 μm each, and cells were cultured for 6–8 h before harvesting total cell lysate for immunoblot analysis. The inhibitors used were the cathepsin inhibitor cysteine cathepsin inhibitor I (CATI-1) (Z-Phe-Gly-NHO-Bz), the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO), and the calpain inhibitors ALLN (N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO) and EST ((2S,3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester). Proliferation Assay—An XTT proliferation kit (Roche Applied Science) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol to determine cytokine-dependent cell proliferation. In brief, cells were plated in 96-well plates at 104 cells/well in 100 μl of medium containing the indicated concentrations of cytokine. After 3.5 days of stimulation for BaF3 cells and 5 days of stimulation of UT7 cells, 50 μl of a 1 mg/ml stock solution of XTT with 5 mmol/liter phenazine methosulfate, an electron coupling agent, was added to each well. The product of XTT reduction by viable cells, reflecting the number of cells per well, was measured at 4 h at 450 nm. Protein Expression Analyses—Surface expression of Myc-Mpl was determined by flow cytometry. For this analysis, 5 × 105 cells were incubated with the mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10 (22Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar) directed against the N-terminal Myc tag of Myc-Mpl for 60 min on ice followed by incubation with the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (BD Biosciences). Untransfected UT-7 cells served as a control. Total amounts of c-Mpl and Mpl-tr were determined by immunoblot analysis using a purified rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against Mpl, as described (12Skoda R.C. Seldin D.C. Chiang M.K. Peichel C.L. Vogt T.F. Leder P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2645-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The same polyclonal antibody and 9E10 were used for the detection of Myc-Mpl protein by immunoblot analysis. To control for protein loading, the membranes were reprobed using the mouse monoclonal antibody AC-40 directed against actin (Sigma). Pulse-chase Analysis—293T cells cultured in 60-mm dishes were transiently transfected with 3 μg of Myc-mpl and 3 μg of mpl-tr expressed off the pcDNA3 expression vector. Pulse-chase analysis was begun 40 h after transfection. To perform the pulse-chase, cell monolayers were washed twice with warm phosphate-buffered saline and starved of methionine and cysteine by incubation for 40 min at 37 °Cin 1 ml of methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Following amino acid starvation, cellular proteins were pulse-labeled by incubating each plate of cells with 400 μCi of methionine/cysteine (Tran35S-label; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min at 37 °C. The radioactive medium was then removed, and the cells were washed twice in warm phosphate-buffered saline, re-fed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm methionine and 2 mm cysteine, and incubated for the indicated times. Cells were collected, and labeled proteins were recovered by denaturing immunoprecipitation using the 9E10 antibody and the method of Hofmann et al. (23Hofmann F. Martelli F. Livingston D.M. Wang Z. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2949-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. The dried gels were quantitated on a Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad) using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Apoptosis—For quantification of apoptosis, UT-7/Myc-Mpl cells were grown at 2 × 105 cells/ml in the presence of either 2 ng/ml human GM-CSF or 2 ng/ml or 20 ng/ml human TPO (gift from Dr. Frederic J. de Sauvage). After 48 h, cells were washed twice and stained with annexin V with the use of the annexin V-FITC kit (Roche Applied Science). FITC-positive cells were quantitated by flow cytometry. Generation of cDNA and Quantitative-PCR (Q-PCR)—RNA was extracted from cell lines by means of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) for 90 min at 37 °C, heat-inactivated, and then purified with RNAeasy (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For reverse-transcriptase-PCR, 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed after random hexamer priming in a 30-μl reaction mix containing 100 units of omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen). The differential quantification of c-mpl and c-mpl-tr was performed on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), as described (24Kralovics R. Buser A.S. Teo S.S. Coers J. Tichelli A. van der Maas A.P. Skoda R.C. Blood. 2003; 102: 1869-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The sequences for the isoform specific primers and for MGB probes were as follows: for the exon 10/11 boundary of murine c-mpl, 5′-GCAATTTCCTGCGCACTACA-3′ (sense), 5′-GGAAGCGAGGGCCACAA-3′ (antisense), 5′-GAGACTGAGGCATGC-3′ (probe); for mpl-tr, 5′-AGCGAGGGCCACAAAGC-3′ (sense), 5′-CAGCTCAAGAGACCTGCTACCA-3′ (antisense), 5′-CCTCAGTCTCCTTCCAGT-3′ (probe). The ΔCT values were derived by subtracting the threshold cycle (CT) values for c-mpl and c-mpl-tr from the CT value for ribosomal protein L19 (RPL19), which serves as an internal control (24Kralovics R. Buser A.S. Teo S.S. Coers J. Tichelli A. van der Maas A.P. Skoda R.C. Blood. 2003; 102: 1869-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 25Ghilardi N. Li J. Hongo J.A. Yi S.

Co-expression of mpl-tr with c-mpl Inhibits TPO-dependent Mitogenic and Survival Signaling—To study the effect of mpl-tr on TPO-dependent proliferation, we used two cytokine-dependent cell lines for cell growth assays: the murine cell line BaF3 and the human megakaryoblastic cell line UT-7. Neither cell line expresses Mpl protein endogenously. To assay the potential effects of mpl-tr on the function of the full-length Mpl protein, we used BaF3 cells stably transfected with murine mpl (BaF3/mpl) (20Stoffel R. Wiestner A. Skoda R.C. Blood. 1996; 87: 567-573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). These cells were subjected to a second round of transfection with an expression vector containing the cDNA for murine mpl-tr. The presence of an intraribosomal entry site followed by a truncated form of human CD4 in the vector allowed selection of mpl-tr-expressing cells using magnetic anti-CD4 microbeads. This procedure was repeated 3–4 times to enrich for CD4-positive cells, and expression of CD4 was confirmed by flow cytometry (data not shown). The sorted cells were cultured with different concentrations of either IL-3 or TPO. As expected, parental BaF3 cells failed to respond to TPO (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, BaF3/mpl cells and BaF3/mpl cells transfected with the parental pCD4 plasmid proliferated in dependence on TPO concentration. In contrast, BaF3/mpl cells expressing mpl-tr failed to show a proliferative response to TPO, behaving similarly to parental BaF3 cells. Importantly, mpl-tr did not have a general inhibitory effect on proliferation because in the presence of IL-3, BaF3/mpl cells expressing mpl-tr grew as efficiently as control cells. The same result was obtained when mpl-tr was expressed in human UT-7 cells that were stably transfected with mpl. In this experiment, we used an mpl construct with five Myc tags at the N terminus (UT-7/Myc-mpl) (Fig. 1). The Myc-Mpl protein conveyed TPO-responsiveness to UT-7 cells, demonstrating that the Myc tag did not interfere with Mpl function (Fig. 2B). When mpl-tr was expressed in UT-7/Myc-mpl cells, TPO-mediated proliferation was abolished, but GM-CSF-dependent proliferation remained unchanged. To test whether the observed inhibitory effect could be mediated by secreted Mpl-tr protein, medium conditioned by mpl-tr-expressing cells was transferred onto BaF3/mpl cells. TPO-dependent proliferation of BaF3/mpl cells was not inhibited by the presence of this conditioned medium (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that no secreted inhibitory activity exists. Since Mpl signaling exerts an anti-apoptotic effect, we analyzed the effect of mpl-tr on TPO-dependent cell survival. UT-7/Myc-mpl cells transfected with either mpl-tr or control vector were cultured with GM-CSF or with TPO. After 48 h, cells were incubated with annexin V and analyzed by flow cytometry. In the presence of GM-CSF, mpl-tr had no effect on the number of annexin V-positive cells. However, with TPO, most cells coexpressing mpl and mpl-tr stained positive for annexin V (Fig. 3). This indicates that mpl-tr expression inhibits the anti-apoptotic signal delivered by TPO.Fig. 3Effect of mpl-tr on cell survival. UT-7/Myc-mpl cells were transfected with pCD4 (open bars) or pCD4-mpl-tr (black bars) and sorted with anti-CD4 microbeads. Cells were cultured in the presence of GM-CSF or TPO at the indicated concentrations for 48 h, stained with FITC-labeled annexin V, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The results of three independent experiments are shown. Error bars indicate the standard deviation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) mpl-tr Mediates Down-modulation of Mpl Protein Expression in a Post-transcriptional Manner—To investigate the inhibitory mechanism exerted by mpl-tr, we analyzed the effects of mpl-tr on Mpl protein expression. First, we asked whether Mpl protein surface expression was affected by the presence of mpl-tr. Cells were stained with anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 4A). As expected, UT-7/Myc-Mpl cells showed marked Myc-mpl surface expression. In contrast, the staining of UT-7/Myc-mpl cells expressing mpl-tr did not significantly differ from the control staining of the parental UT-7 cells, indicating that mpl-tr interferes with Myc-mpl cell surface expression. We then asked whether the lack of detectable Myc-Mpl surface expression correlated with a decrease in total Myc-Mpl protein. Immunoblot analysis of total cell lysates demonstrated a massive reduction of Myc-Mpl protein in cells that expressed mpl-tr (Fig. 4B). The decrease in Myc-Mpl protein was observed irrespective of whether the cells were grown with TPO or GM-CSF. Importantly, mpl-tr did not alter mpl mRNA levels, as indicated by the unchanged ΔCT values for mpl (Fig. 4B). Expression of mpl-tr also led to a dramatic decrease in expression of the untagged Mpl protein in BaF3/mpl cells without affecting mRNA levels, showing that mpl-tr targets mpl protein regardless of the presence of an N-terminal Myc tag (see Fig. 6C). To determine whether this phenomenon was limited to hematopoietic cells, we performed transient co-transfections of mpl and mpl-tr cDNAs into human 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 4C, expression of mpl-tr in 293T cells lowered the amount of Mpl protein without altering mpl mRNA expression.Fig. 6Functional analysis of the C-terminal peptide of Mpl-tr. A, a schematic drawing of Mpl-tr protein and two mpl-tr mutants used in this study. The amino acid sequence of the junction and the C-terminal 30 amino acids are shown. In the tr-Δpep30 mutant, all C-terminal 30 amino acids of Mpl-tr are removed. In the tr-pepmpl mutant, the pep30 peptide is replaced by 30 amino acids derived from the mpl reading frame of exon 11. B, proliferation of BaF3/mpl cells stably transfected with pCD4 (open squares), pCD4-mpl-tr (filled triangles), pCD4-Δpep30 (open triangles), and pCD4-tr-pepmpl (filled diamonds) in the presence of increasing concentrations of IL-3 or TPO (numbers indicate concentration in ng/ml). Error bars indicate the standard deviation. C, immunoblot analysis of total lysates from the same cells as in B. Expression of mpl mRNA is indicated by the ΔCT values below the corresponding lanes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) mpl-tr Mediates Dose-dependent Reduction of Mpl Protein Expression and a Decrease of Mpl Protein Half-life, whereas Steady-state Levels of mpl-tr Remain Unchanged—To quantify the effect of mpl-tr on Mpl expression, we transiently co-transfected 293T cells with a constant amount of plasmid encoding mpl and varying amounts of plasmid for the expression of mpl-tr. In this experiment, Mpl protein amount was affected by mpl-tr in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). Measuring mRNA levels by Q-PCR confirmed that mRNA expression correlated with the amount of plasmid DNA transfected. For example, the mpl-tr (ΔCT) value for cells transfected with 0.1 μg of mpl-tr was –4. Cells transfected with 30 times the amount of mpl-tr (3 μg) had an mpl-tr (ΔCT) value of –9. This corresponds to a decrease of 5 CT, which equals 25 = 32 times higher expression of mpl-tr (Fig. 5A). In the converse experiment, we transfected 293T cells with a constant amount of mpl-tr and varied the concentration of mpl. We found that steady-state expression of Mpl-tr was not altered by the presence of increasing amounts of mpl (Fig. 5B). Since mpl-tr affects the steady-state levels of Mpl protein, we determined the half-life of Mpl by a pulse-chase experiment (Fig. 5C). In the presence of mpl-tr, the half-life of Mpl was decreased from 5 to 6 h to 2 to 3 h (Fig. 5C). CATI-1 Restores Mpl Protein Expression in the Presence of mpl-tr—To identify the mechanism that underlies diminished Mpl protein expression in the presence of mpl-tr, we treated mpl-tr-transfected UT-7/Myc-mpl cells with the cathepsin inhibitor CATI-1, the proteasome inhibitor MG132, or the calpain inhibitors ALLN or EST. Inhibitors were added at a final concentration of 25 μm each, and cells were cultured for 6–8 h in the presence of GM-CSF. Only CAPI-1 restored Mpl protein expression (Fig. 5D), and a weak Mpl band was detectable with MG132 treatment, whereas the other inhibitors had no effect. None of the inhibitors changed the steady-state Mpl protein levels in the UT-7/Myc-mpl cells lacking mpl-tr (Fig. 5E). To confirm these results in a different cell system, we also treated 293T cells with CATI-1 and determined Mpl protein expression. Similar to UT-7/Myc-mpl, 293T cells co-transfected with mpl and mpl-tr showed a rescue of Mpl protein expression in the presence of CATI-1 (Fig. 5F). These results argue that mpl-tr mediates Mpl protein degradation by a cathepsin-like protease activity. The C-terminal Peptide Sequence of Mpl-tr Is Necessary but Not Sufficient for the Inhibition of Cell Proliferation and for Mpl Protein Degradation—The amino acid sequence of Mpl-tr is identical to the N terminus of Mpl except for a stretch at the C terminus of Mpl-tr, 30 amino acids in length (Fig. 1). We therefore speculated that this unique C-terminal peptide in Mpl-tr could be of functional importance. To test this hypothesis, we made two mutants of mpl-tr. In the first mutant, Δpep30, we introduced a stop codon at position 427, removing the entire C-terminal peptide (Fig. 6A). In the second mutant, tr-pepmpl, the sequence of the C-terminal peptide was changed by adding 2 bp, which restored the reading frame of full-length mpl, and by introducing a stop codon terminating the reading frame after 30 amino acids (Fig. 6A). With these mpl-tr mutants, we stably transfected BaF3/mpl cells and assayed TPO-dependent proliferation. As shown in Fig. 6B, only mpl-tr abrogated mpl-mediated cell growth, whereas tr-Δpep30 and tr-pepmpl did not interfere with TPO-dependent proliferation. As expected, the mpl-tr mutants did not interfere with the proliferative responses to IL-3 (Fig. 6B). Immunoblot analysis showed that Δpep30 and tr-pepmpl were expressed at levels similar to Mpl-tr (Fig. 6C). This indicates that the degree of expression does not explain the failure of the mutants to inhibit TPO-dependent growth. Importantly, the levels of Mpl protein in cells expressing the mpl-tr mutants were similar to BaF3/mpl control cells, but Mpl was undetectable in cells expressing mpl-tr. These results demonstrate that the C-terminal peptide sequence from Mpl-tr is required for the ability of Mpl-tr to promote a decrease in Mpl protein and to inhibit TPO-dependent cell proliferation.

To identify regions responsible for the differential regulation of RyR1 and RyR2 by CaM, we generated chimeras encompassing and flanking the CaM-binding domain. We found that the exchange of the N- and C-terminal flanking regions differentially affected RyR1 and RyR2. A RyR1/RyR2 chimera with an N-terminal flanking RyR2 substitution (RyR2 amino acid (aa) 3537–3579) was activated by CaM in single channel measurements at both submicromolar and micromolar Ca2+. A RyR2/RyR1 chimera with a C-terminal flanking the 86-amino acid RyR1 substitution (RyR1 aa 3640–3725) bound 35S-CaM but was not inhibited by CaM at submicromolar Ca2+. In this region, five non-conserved amino acid residues (RyR1 aa 3680 and 3682–3685 and RyR2 aa 3647 and 3649–3652) differentially affect RyR helical probability. Substitution of the five amino acid residues in RyR1 with those of RyR2 showed responses to CaM comparable with wild type RyR1. In contrast, substitution of the five amino acid residues in RyR2 with those of RyR1 showed loss of CaM inhibition, whereas substitution of the five RyR2 sequence residues in the RyR2 chimera containing the RyR1 calmodulin-binding domain and C-flanking sequence restored wild type RyR2 inhibition by CaM at submicromolar Ca2+. The results suggest that different regions are involved in CaM modulation of RyR1 and RyR2. They further suggest that five non-conserved amino acids in the C-terminal region flanking the CaM-binding domain have a key role in CaM inhibition of RyR2.

The CaM-binding domain is highly conserved among the mammalian isoforms, yet corresponding mutations in the RyR1 and RyR2 CaM-binding domain resulted in a different response to CaM in 35S-CaM binding and functional measurements (13Yamaguchi N. Xu L. Pasek D.A. Evans K.E. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23480-23486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This result suggests that other isoform-specific regions are responsible for the differential modulation of RyR1 and RyR2 by CaM. To test the hypothesis of an involvement of isoform-specific regions in regulating RyR1 and RyR2 by CaM, we constructed a series of RyR1/RyR2 chimeras and determined their CaM-binding properties and modulation by CaM. The results suggest that multiple regions are involved in transducing the functional effects of CaM in RyR1 and RyR2. The present study focused on the role of one of these regions. We found that substitution of five amino acid residues in RyR2 with those of RyR1 eliminated CaM inhibition but not CaM binding at [Ca2+] < 1 μm. Materials—[3H]Ryanodine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Tran35S-label from ICN Radiochemicals (Costa Mesa, CA), unlabeled ryanodine from Calbiochem, Complete protease inhibitors from Roche Applied Science, and HEK293 cells from the American Type Culture Collection. RyR2 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Junichi Nakai of RIKEN Brain Science Institute (Wako, Japan). Unlabeled CaM and 35S-CaM were prepared as described previously (10Balshaw D.M. Xu L. Yamaguchi N. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20144-20153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Construction of RyR cDNAs—The full-length rabbit RyR1 (14Gao L. Tripathy A. Lu X. Meissner G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and RyR2 (15Nakai J. Imagawa T. Hakamata Y. Shigekawa M. Takeshima H. Numa S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) cDNAs were subcloned into expression vectors pCMV5 and pCIneo, respectively. Single and multiple base changes were introduced by Pfu-turbo polymerase-based chain reaction, using mutagenic oligonucleotides and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The complete mutated DNA fragments amplified by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing. A schematic summary and the amino acid numbers of RyR chimeras are shown in Fig. 1. To construct RyR2-based chimeras and mutants, a ClaI/SacII-(10483–11203) fragment of RyR2 was subcloned into pBluescript KS vector. For RyR1-based chimeras and mutants (except RyR1-10M), an EclXI/NdeI-(10741–11173) (for 1-2-1, 1-2-1(C), and RyR1-5M) or an EclXI/BamHI-(10741–10983) (for 1-2-1(N)) fragment was subcloned into pBluescript KS vector. The creation of 1-2-1 and 2-1-2 chimeras involved the use of a common restriction enzyme site (NdeI, 11173 of RyR1, and 11071 of RyR2) and the introduction of a new site (EclXI) in RyR2 at a location corresponding to the EclXI site in RyR1. For other chimeras, additional specific enzyme sites (SphI for 1-2-1(N) and 2-1-2(N) and NcoI for 1-2-1(C) and 2-1-2(C)) were introduced at corresponding positions in the RyR1 and RyR2 sequences. The aforementioned EclXI site was also used for obtaining 1-2-1(N) and 2-1-2(N), and EclXI/SphI and NcoI/NdeI fragments were exchanged for N- and C-terminal replacements, respectively. After construction of the chimeric fragments, sequences of SphI and NcoI sites were changed back to the original sequences in order not to cause amino acid changes. The chimeric ClaI/SacII fragment was subcloned back to the original position of a vector containing the BbrPI/SacII-(5038–11203) fragment of RyR2 and then to full-length RyR2 in the pCIneo expression vector to construct the full-length RyR2-based chimera expression plasmids. The chimera EclXI/NdeI or EclXI/BamHI fragment was subcloned back to a vector containing a PvuI/NdeI-(8469–11173) fragment of RyR1 and then to a vector containing PvuI/XbaI-(8469-polylinker) fragment. Full-length expression plasmids for RyR1-based chimeras were prepared by ligation of two fragments (ClaI/PvuI and PvuI/XbaI) and expression vector pCMV5 (ClaI/XbaI). To construct RyR1-10M, a vector containing the PinAI/XhoI-(4935–6467) fragment of RyR1 was used as a template for mutagenesis. The mutated fragment was subcloned back to a vector containing ClaI/PvuI-(polylinker-8469), and then a full-length expression plasmid was prepared by 3′ fragment ligation as described above. Nucleotide numbering is as described previously (15Nakai J. Imagawa T. Hakamata Y. Shigekawa M. Takeshima H. Numa S.

Expression of Full-length RyRs in HEK293 Cells—RyR cDNAs were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and were plated the day before transfection. For each 10-cm tissue culture dish, 3.5 μg of cDNA was used. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and crude membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (12Yamaguchi N. Xin C. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22579-22585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). 35S-Calmodulin Binding—Crude membrane fractions of HEK293 cells were incubated for 2.5 h at room temperature with 15–200 nm35S-CaM in 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.15 m sucrose, 150 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm glutathione (reduced), 25 μm leupeptin, 250 μm Pefabloc, and either 5 mm EGTA, 0.4 μm Ca2+, or 100 μm Ca2+. Aliquots were taken for determination of total radioactivity and centrifuged for 30 min at 90,000 × g in a Beckman Airfuge to obtain bound 35S-CaM. Radioactivity levels were determined by scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding of 35S-CaM was determined by incubating equal amounts of protein derived from vector-transfected HEK293 cells. In parallel experiments, Bmax values of [3H]ryanodine binding were determined by incubating membranes at room temperature with a saturating concentration of [3H]ryanodine (40 nm) in 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.6 m KCl, 0.15 m sucrose, 25 μm leupeptin, 250 μm Pefabloc, and 200 μm Ca2+. Nonspecific binding was determined using a 1000–2000-fold excess of unlabeled ryanodine. After 5 h, samples were diluted with 8 volumes of ice-cold water and placed on Whatman GF/B filters pre-incubated with 2% polyethyleneimine in water. Filters were washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold 100 mm KCl, 1 mm KPipes, pH 7.0, solution. The radioactivity remaining with the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting to obtain the amount of bound [3H]ryanodine. Single Channel Analysis—Single channel measurements of WT and mutant RyRs were performed in planar lipid bilayers containing phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylcholine in the ratio of 5:3:2 (25 mg of total phospholipid/ml of n-decane) as described previously (13Yamaguchi N. Xu L. Pasek D.A. Evans K.E. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23480-23486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Crude membrane fractions expressing WT and mutant RyRs were pretreated for 30 min at room temperature with 1 μm myosin light chain kinase-derived CaM-binding peptide to dissociate endogenous CaM (10Balshaw D.M. Xu L. Yamaguchi N. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20144-20153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Final peptide concentration was <10 nm following the addition of membranes to the cis (cytosolic) chamber of the bilayer apparatus. A strong dependence of single channel activities on cis-Ca2+ concentration indicated that the large cytosolic “foot” region faced the cis chamber of the bilayers. The trans (lumenal) side of the bilayer was defined as ground. Measurements were made with symmetrical 0.25 m KCl, 20 mm KHepes, pH 7.4, with 0.4 μm or 2 μm free Ca2+ in the cis chamber. Single channel recordings with WT-RyR1 and chimeras were made in the presence of 0.4 μm Ca2+ and 1 mm ATP to increase the otherwise very low channel activities. Exogenous CaM was added to the cis solution. Electrical signals were filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and analyzed as described previously (17Gao L. Balshaw D. Xu L. Tripathy A. Xin C. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 828-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Po values in multichannel recordings were calculated using the equation Po = Σ iPo,i/N, where N is the total number of channels, and Po,i is channel open probability of the ith channel. Biochemical Assays and Data Analysis—Free Ca2+ concentrations were obtained by including in the solutions the appropriate amounts of Ca2+ and EGTA as determined using the stability constants and computer program published by Shoenmakers et al. (18Schoenmakers T.J. Visser G.J. Flick G. Theuvenet A.P.R. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 870-879PubMed Google Scholar). Free Ca2+ concentrations of ≥1 μm were verified with the use of a Ca2+-selective electrode. Results are given as mean ± S.E. Significance of differences in the data (p < 0.05) was determined using Student's t test. To identify the isoform-specific regions involved in CaM modulation, we prepared 10 RyR1- and RyR2-based chimeras and multisite mutants (Fig. 1B) and transiently expressed them in HEK293 cells. All chimeras and mutants showed a Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding corresponding to that of WT-RyR1 or WT-RyR2 (19Nakai J. Gao L. Xu L. Xin C. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). 35S-CaM Binding of RyR2-based Chimeras and Mutants— The ability of RyR2-based chimeras and mutants to bind CaM was investigated by a centrifugation assay. Three different concentrations of metabolically labeled 35S-CaM were used at three different Ca2+ concentrations of 5 mm EGTA (Ca2+-free), 0.4 μm free Ca2+ (a Ca2+ concentration that results in activation of RyR1 but inhibition of RyR2 by CaM (10Balshaw D.M. Xu L. Yamaguchi N. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20144-20153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar)), and 100 μm Ca2+ (Ca2+-CaM). The Bmax values of [3H]ryanodine binding were determined in parallel experiments to determine RyR protein expression levels. Fig. 2 shows that WT-RyR2 bound 35S-CaM in a concentration-dependent manner. WT-RyR2 bound 2.0 ± 0.3 35S-CaM per high affinity [3H]ryanodine-binding site at 200 nm CaM and < 10 nm Ca2+, which corresponds to 0.5 CaM per RyR2 subunit because there is only one high affinity [3H]ryanodine-binding site per RyR2 tetramer. Higher saturating CaM concentrations were not used because these resulted in high background binding levels. The mean numbers of bound 35S-CaM per RyR2 subunit were 0.6 at 200 nm CaM and 0.4 μm Ca2+ and 0.9 at 75 nm CaM and 100 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 2), which were in good agreement with values reported previously (13Yamaguchi N. Xu L. Pasek D.A. Evans K.E. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23480-23486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 also shows that all RyR2-based chimeras and mutants (Fig. 1B, left panel) examined in this study bound 35S-CaM. Some differences in the binding levels were observed; however, none of these were significantly different from WT-RyR2. The expression levels of RyR1-based chimeras and mutants (Fig. 1B, right panel) were too low to determine their CaM binding levels. The Bmax values of [3H]ryanodine binding were ∼0.1–0.2 pmol/mg of protein, compared with >0.5 pmol/mg for RyR2-based chimeras. CaM Modulation of RyR2-based Chimeras and Mutants—Fig. 3 compares the modulation of WT-RyR1 and WT-RyR2 by 50 nm and 1 μm CaM with that of chimera 2-1-2 in the presence of 0.4 μm and 2 μm cytosolic free Ca2+. Chimera 2-1-2 has a region of 145 amino acid residues composed of the RyR1 CaMBD and RyR1 N- and C-terminal flanking regions (Fig. 1). 2-1-2 was inhibited by CaM at 2 μm Ca2+, in accordance with an inhibition of WT-RyR1 and WT-RyR2 by CaM at [Ca2+] > 1 μm. At 0.4 μm Ca2+, CaM had no significant effect on the chimera. 2-1-2 was activated by 50 nm and 1 μm CaM in 6 of 15 and 5 of 13 single channel recordings and inhibited in 5 of 15 and 7 of 13 recordings, respectively. In the remaining channel recordings, CaM was without an effect. The results suggest that regions encompassing and flanking the CaMBD have a role in CaM modulation of the RyRs. To identify the region that was responsible for loss of a significant effect of calmodulin on 2-1-2 at 0.4 μm Ca2+, the chimeric region was subdivided into an N-terminal flanking (2-1-2(N)), CaM-binding, and C-terminal flanking (2-1-2(C)) region. As described in a previous study (13Yamaguchi N. Xu L. Pasek D.A. Evans K.E. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23480-23486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), substitution of the four non-identical amino acids in the RyR2 CaM-binding domain (Fig. 1A) with the corresponding amino acids in RyR1 yielded results essentially identical to WT-RyR2. Replacement of the N-terminal flanking region (2-1-2(N)) also did not alter CaM inhibition at 0.4 μm and 2 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 1B). In contrast, exchange of the C-terminal flanking region (2-1-2(C)) eliminated CaM inhibition at 0.4 μm Ca2+ and significant inhibition at 2 μm Ca2+ by 50 nm (but not by 1 μm) CaM, notwithstanding that 2-1-2(C) bound 35S-CaM with an affinity comparable with WT-RyR2. The N- and C-terminal flanking regions of RyR1 and RyR2 have a sequence identity of 41 and 63%, respectively, compared with 86% for the CaMBD. Secondary structure predictions, using a protein sequence analysis program (bmerc-www.bu.edu/psa/) (20Stultz C.M. Nambudripad R. Lathrop R.H. White J.V. Allewell N. Woodward C. Protein Structural Biology in Bio-Medical Research. 22B. JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1997: 447-506Google Scholar) indicated a nearly indistinguishable helical probability for the RyR1 and RyR2 CaMBDs (Fig. 4A). In contrast, major differences were predicted for both the N-flanking and C-flanking regions. The differences in helical probability of N-terminal flanking regions are caused to a large extent by an RyR2-specific insert (RyR2 aa 3564–3575). We previously showed that an RyR2 mutant lacking this insert bound 35S-CaM and was inhibited by CaM in a manner essentially identical to WT-RyR2 (13Yamaguchi N. Xu L. Pasek D.A. Evans K.E. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23480-23486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Therefore, this region does not appear to have a major role in CaM modulation of RyR2. In the C-terminal flanking region, protein sequence analysis predicted several differences in helical probability. In the present study, we address the role of five non-conserved RyR amino acid residues (RyR2 aa 3647 and 3649–3652) that have a profound effect on helical probability. Substitution of these five amino acid residues with those of RyR1 in RyR2 (RyR2–5M) increased helical probability close to that in RyR1 (Fig. 4B). Single channel measurements showed a loss of inhibition by CaM at 0.4 μm Ca2+ (Figs. 1B and 5A). A role of the five amino acid residues in CaM inhibition of RyR2 was further assessed by substituting the five RyR1 amino acids in 2-1-2 and 2-1-2(C) with those of RyR2. Substitution restored CaM inhibition at 0.4 μm Ca2+ in 2-1-2(C)rev5M but not 2-1-2rev5M (Figs. 1B and 5, B and C). The difference in the ability of the five RyR2 amino acids to restore CaM inhibition was likely the result of the presence of the N-flanking RyR1 region in 2-1-2, because this region contributes to CaM modulation of RyR1 as described below. At 2 μm Ca2+, RyR2–5M, 2-1-2rev5M, and 2-1-2(C)rev5M were inhibited by CaM (Figs. 1B and 5); however, inhibition was only significant at 1 μm CaM and not 50 nm CaM (Fig. 1B), which indicated a decreased efficacy of CaM in modulating the mutant channels.Fig. 5Effects of CaM on RyR2-5M, 2-1-2(C)rev5M, and 2-1-2rev5M ion channels. Single channel currents of RyR2-5M (A), 2-1-2(C)rev5M (B), and 2-1-2rev5M (C) were recorded as in Fig. 3 at –20 mV (c, downward deflections from closed level) in symmetric 0.25 m KCl, 20 mm KHepes, pH 7.4, medium with 0.4 μm Ca2+ (left panels) or 2 μm Ca2+ (right panels) in the cis chamber before (top traces) and after the addition of 50 nm CaM (middle traces) and 1 μm CaM (bottom traces). Data of 4–10 single channel recordings are summarized in Fig. 1B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) CaM Modulation of RyR1-based Chimeras and Mutants—We also constructed and expressed four RyR1-based reverse chimeras and mutants, 1-2-1, 1-2-1(N), 1-2-1(C), and RyR1-5M. Characterization of RyR1-based chimeras relied on single channel recordings because their expression levels were too low to determine 35S-CaM binding levels (see above). CaM failed to either activate or inhibit the 1-2-1 chimera (Fig. 1B). Replacement of only the N-terminal flanking region decreased the efficacy of CaM activation at 0.4 μm Ca2+ and, surprisingly, at 2 μm Ca2+ resulted in significant activation of 1-2-1(N) following the addition of 1 μm CaM. In contrast, replacement of the C-terminal region failed to disrupt CaM modulation of 1-2-1(C) at either Ca2+ concentration. Substitution of the five amino acid residues in RyR1 with those of RyR2 decreased helical probability (Fig. 4B) without affecting CaM activation and inhibition of RyR1-5M (Fig. 1B), which was consistent with the results of 1-2-1(C). Interestingly, at 0.4 μm Ca2+, CaM activated RyR1-5M to a greater extent than WT-RyR1 (average open probability in the presence of 1 μm CaM was 1609 ± 450% (n = 4) of control, compared with WT-RyR1 at 295 ± 52%). Taken together, substitution of the N- and C-terminal flanking regions appeared to differentially affect RyR2 and RyR1. Furthermore, substitution of five non-conserved amino acid residues in the C-terminal flanking region resulted in impairment of CaM modulation of the RyR2-5M mutant, without disrupting CaM modulation of the RyR1-5M mutant. Role of RyR1 Amino Acid Residues 1975–1999 —Recent trypsin digestion studies and CaM-binding experiments with RyR1 peptides indicate that the carboxyl-terminal half of CaM binds to the RyR1 CaM-binding domain, whereas the N-terminal half interacts with RyR1 amino acid residues 1975–1999 (21Zhang H. Zhang J.Z. Danila C.I. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8348-8355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). There are 10 non-identical RyR1 and RyR2 amino acid residues in this region. We substituted the 10 aa residues in RyR1 with the corresponding RyR2 residues. The RyR1-10M mutant was activated and inhibited by CaM in single channel (Fig. 6) and [3H]ryanodine binding (not shown) measurements that were essentially identical to WT-RyR1, which suggests that this region is not responsible for the differential regulation of RyR1 and RyR2 by CaM at [Ca2+] < 1 μm. Cryomicroscopy studies revealed that the CaM-binding site in the skeletal muscle RyR isoform is at least 10 nm away from the effector site (pore) and that Ca2+ binding causes an ∼33-Å shift of the binding site (22Samso M. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1349-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, long range conformational changes are likely involved in the modulation of RyR activity by CaM. RyR1 and RyR2 each have a single highly conserved CaM-binding region; however, the two RyR isoforms are differentially regulated by CaM, which suggests that isoform-specific regions are involved in transducing the functional effects of CaM. In the present study, we identified one of these regions. Secondary structure predictions indicated a large difference between the helical probability of five non-conserved amino acid residues in the C-terminal region flanking the CaM-binding domain of RyR1 and RyR2. Substitution of the five amino acid residues in RyR2 with those of RyR1 eliminated CaM inhibition at submicromolar Ca2+ and decreased the efficacy of CaM inhibition at micromolar Ca2+. Conversely, substitution of the corresponding RyR2 amino acid residues in RyR1 was without effect on CaM activation and CaM inhibition at Ca2+ concentrations below and above 1 μm, respectively. Thus, five amino acid residues in the C-terminal region flanking the CaM-binding domain appear to have a specific role in CaM modulation of RyR2. The RyR2-based chimeras were characterized in 35S-CaM binding and single channel measurements. Characterization of RyR1-based chimeras relied on single channel measurements because expression levels were too low to obtain reliable 35S-CaM binding data. Although all RyR2-based constructs bound 35S-CaM, regardless of whether the constructs contained the RyR1 or RyR2 CaMBD, 2-1-2, 2-1-2(C), and RyR2-5M were unable to convert CaM binding into a functional signal. Interestingly, loss of function was confined to [Ca2+] < 1 μm because CaM inhibition was observed at [Ca2+] > 1 μm. We also note that the “uncoupled” constructs had a K+ conductance and Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding comparable with WT-RyR2. The results suggest disruption of the interactions of the CaMBD with protein domains that transduce the functional effects of CaM in RyR2 at [Ca2+] < 1 μm. Ikemoto and Yamamoto (23Ikemoto N. Yamamoto T. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d671-d683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that exogenously added RyR1 synthetic peptides alter channel activity by “unzipping” interdomain interactions in the large RyR1 channel complex. RyR1 mutations giving rise to malignant hyperthermia were suggested to result in elevated channel activities by disrupting interdomain interactions. Zhu et al. (24Zhu X. Ghanta J. Walker J.W. Allen P.D. Valdivia H.H. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) found that synthetic peptides corresponding to the CaMBD affect RyR1 channel function, which suggested that the exogenously added peptides bound to a region that directly interacts with the CaMBD. Previously, we presented evidence for the importance of three amino acid residues in this interaction in RyR2. Three mutations in the RyR2 CaMBD (W3587A, L3591D, and F3603A) eliminated CaM inhibition at 0.4 μm Ca2+, without an effect on CaM binding (13Yamaguchi N. Xu L. Pasek D.A. Evans K.E. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23480-23486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The present work extends the previous studies by providing the first clues regarding the identity of regions that transduce the functional effects of CaM in RyR1 and RyR2 Analysis revealed that substitution of five non-conserved RyR1 amino acid residues in 2-1-2(C) restored CaM inhibition at [Ca2+] < 1 μm. On the other hand, substitution of the five RyR1 residues in 2-1-2 did not restore CaM inhibition. Thus, the additional presence of the N-terminal region likely introduced conformational changes that could not be reversed by replacing the five amino acid residues in 2-1-2rev5M. We also tested the role of the two regions flanking the CaMBD in RyR1. Chimera 1-2-1 was not modulated by CaM, in contrast to chimera 2-1-2, which was inhibited at [Ca2+] > 1 μm. Further analysis showed that exchange of only the C-terminal flanking region did not eliminate CaM activation and CaM inhibition in the RyR1-based chimera 1-2-1(C), whereas CaM inhibition of 2-1-2(C) was disrupted at [Ca2+] < 1 μm. Opposite effects were observed when the N-terminal flanking region was exchanged in RyR1 and RyR2. Replacement of this region did not interfere with CaM inhibition in 2-1-2(N). The efficacy of CaM activation of 1-2-1(N) was reduced at 0.4 μm Ca2+ and unexpectedly resulted in CaM activation of 1-2-1(N) at 2 μm Ca2+. Further studies will be required to determine whether the structural elements responsible for activation of 1-2-1(N) lie within the N-terminal flanking region. Zhang et al. (21Zhang H. Zhang J.Z. Danila C.I. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8348-8355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) suggested that the carboxyl-terminal half of CaM binds to the RyR1 CaM-binding domain, whereas the N-terminal half interacts with RyR1 amino acid residues 1975–1999. We substituted the 10 non-identical amino acid residues in RyR1 with the corresponding RyR2 residues and found that the mutant was regulated by CaM essentially identical to WT-RyR1, which suggests that this region is not responsible for the differential regulation of RyR1 and RyR2 by CaM at [Ca2+] < 1 μm. Our data show that the 1-2-1 chimera was not inhibited by CaM, notwithstanding that the chimera contained the RyR2 CaMBD and N- and C-terminal flanking regions. Chimera 2-1-2 was not significantly activated at [Ca2+] < 1 μm Ca2+, despite the presence of the RyR1 CaMBD and flanking regions. These results suggest that additional regions are involved in the CaM modulation of RyR1 and RyR2, as expected considering the large size of the RyRs. In summary, our structure-function analysis shows that it is possible to use chimeras and multiple site mutants to define the Ca2+-dependent and isoform-dependent regulation of RyR1 and RyR2 by CaM. The chimeras described here formed channels with a Ca2+ dependence and K+ conductance comparable with WT-RyRs, which suggests that our structural manipulations did not introduce major global conformational changes, and thus can reveal regions that have a role in the Ca2+-dependent and isoform-dependent CaM modulation of RyR1 and RyR2. Our work points to one of these regions consisting of five amino acid residues in the C-terminal flanking region of the CaMBD of the RyR2 ion channel."

Site-directed mutagenesis experiments altering these residues to alanines and other amino acids were carried out to probe the relevance of these interactions in the catalytic activities of the enzyme. The results show that the side chains of Arg-195 and Gln-197 are required for DNA cleavage by the enzyme and are likely to be important for positioning of the G strand of DNA at the active site prior to DNA cleavage. Mutation of Ser-192 did not affect DNA binding and cleavage but nevertheless decreased the overall rate of relaxation of supercoiled DNA probably because of its participation in a later step of the reaction pathway.

DNA topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze the interconversion of different DNA topological forms by the concerted breaking and rejoining of one or two DNA strands; these are coupled to the DNA strand passage through the break created. The various families of type I and II DNA topoisomerases play important roles in vital cellular processes including replication, transcription, and recombination (1Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2192) Google Scholar, 2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar, 3Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase I is a type IA DNA topoisomerase responsible for removal of excess negative supercoils from the bacterial DNA (4Drlica K. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 5Zechiedrich E.L. Khodursky A.B. Bachellier S. Schneider R. Chen D. Lilley D.M. Cozzarellis N.R. J. Biol.

In each catalytic cycle of the proposed enzyme-bridging mechanism, the enzyme binds and cleaves a single strand of DNA (denoted as G strand here), forming a covalent 5′-phosphotyrosine linkage to DNA, to create a “gate” for subsequent strand passage (7Brown P.O. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 8Li Z. Mondragón A. DiGate R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 301-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A number of residues proximal to the active site tyrosine have been implicated by previous biochemical and genetic experiments as important for interacting with the scissile phosphate in the DNA cleavage step. However, contacts with other phosphates on the DNA are also likely to be important in the mechanism of the enzyme because sequence-specific recognition of DNA bases does not appear to be an overriding factor in interaction of the enzyme with the DNA substrate. These interactions may be important for catalytic stages of the enzyme either prior to or after the nucleophilic attack on the scissile phosphate. Important insights into the potential enzyme-phosphate contacts have come from several crystal structures of E. coli topoisomerase I and III. In the crystal structure of the 67-kDa N-terminal fragment of the enzyme, the tyrosine responsible for DNA cleavage (Tyr-319) is not accessible for interaction with the DNA substrate (9Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Modragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This structure probably represents a closed conformation of the enzyme. From this closed conformation, the enzyme is expected to undergo conformational changes, first to allow the G strand DNA to bind to the enzyme, and second to position the hydroxyl group of Tyr-319 for nucleophilic attack on a scissile phosphate on the bound G strand DNA. The enzyme-DNA complex poised for DNA cleavage should resemble the complex formed between single-stranded DNA and E. coli topoisomerase III with the active site tyrosine mutated to phenylalanine (10Changela A. DiGate R.J. Modragón A. Nature. 2001; 411: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this topoisomerase III-ssDNA 1The abbreviation used is: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA. complex (Fig. 1a), the side chains of residues corresponding to Arg-195 and Gln-197 of E. coli topoisomerase I make contacts with the DNA phosphodiester backbone at two of the phosphates 5′ but not directly adjacent to the scissile phosphate (10Changela A. DiGate R.J. Modragón A. Nature. 2001; 411: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In a structure of the N-terminal domain of E. coli topoisomerase I (with H365R substitution) complexed to single-stranded DNA, the active site is not formed (11Perry K. Modragón A. Structure. 2003; 11: 1349-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Nevertheless the ssDNA occupies the groove leading to the active site (Fig. 1b), and it was postulated that this structure represents an intermediate conformational state in the catalytic cycle (11Perry K. Modragón A. Structure. 2003; 11: 1349-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this structure, Gln-197 and Ser-192 contact the phosphodiester backbone, but Arg-195 does not make any DNA contacts (Fig. 1). Arg-195 and Gln-197 are located at the N-terminal region of an α helix that has shifted significantly in the topoisomerase III-ssDNA structure (10Changela A. DiGate R.J. Modragón A. Nature. 2001; 411: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and Ser-192 is found in the loop leading to this shifted α helix. These three residues are part of a highly conserved region among type IA DNA topoisomerase sequences that extends from Ser-192 to Ser-198 (SARGVQS), with Ser-192 and Gln-197 both being invariant (11Perry K. Modragón A. Structure. 2003; 11: 1349-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12Caron P.R. Bjornsti M-A. Osheroff N. 1st Ed. DNA Topoisomerase Protocols: DNA Topology and Enzymes. 1. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 279-316Google Scholar). In contrast, many other residues observed to make contacts with the bound DNA are not highly conserved (10Changela A. DiGate R.J. Modragón A. Nature. 2001; 411: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, there is a lack of direct biochemical or genetic evidence supporting the roles of these conserved residues in the relaxation of DNA by the enzyme. The contacts between Ser-192, Arg-195, Gln-197, and the DNA phosphodiester backbone away from the active site tyrosine may be important for the initial binding and/or positioning of the G strand of DNA at the active site for DNA cleavage during the catalytic cycle. To test this hypothesis, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to investigate the effects of the single substitutions on enzyme activity. Enzymes—Wild-type and mutant E. coli DNA topoisomerase I proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (13Zhu C.-X. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Bjornsti M.-A. Osheroff N. 1st Ed. DNA Topoisomerase Protocols: DNA Topology and Enzymes. 1. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 145-152Google Scholar). Plasmid-expressing mutant topoisomerase I was generated from plasmid pRV10 (14Wang J.C. Peck L.J. Becherer K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1982; 47: 85-91Crossref Google Scholar) as a template using Pfu ultra DNA polymerase I (from Stratagene). The topoisomerase I gene in this plasmid is under the control of the lacUV5 promoter, and the lacIq gene is also present on the plasmid to reduce the basal level of expression. The primers used in the mutagenesis were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys, and the sequences of the top strand oligonucleotides with the mutated bases underlined were 5′-GCTCGTGGCCTGGCTGCCGGTCGTG-3′ (S192A), 5′-GCTCGTGGCCTGACCGCCGGTCGTG-3′ (S192T), 5′-CTGTCTGCCGGTGCTGTGCAGTCGGTG-3′ (R195A), 5′-CTGTCTGCCGGTAAAGTGCAGTCGGTG-3′ (R195K), 5′-GCCGGTCGTGTGGCGTCGGTGGCGGTTC-3′ (Q197A). Relaxation Activity Assay—Relaxation of negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA was assayed in a 20-μl reaction volume of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml gelatin, 6 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 μg of CsCl gradient-purified supercoiled plasmid DNA. Other concentrations of sodium chloride or potassium glutamate were used in some experiments. Incubation was at 37 °C for the indicated lengths of time. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 50 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol, and 0.5% (v/v) bromphenol blue. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel with TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.1, 2 mm EDTA). The Alpha-Imager was used to record the image of the gel stained with ethidium bromide. Single-stranded DNA Cleavage Assay—A 203-base-long 32P-5′-end-labeled single-stranded DNA substrate with a strong topoisomerase I cleavage site (15Kirkegaard K. Pflugfelder G. Wang J.C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) derived from λ DNA was prepared as described previously (16Cheng B. Feng J. Gadgil S. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8648-8654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This was incubated with wild-type or mutant topoisomerase I at 37 °C for 30 min in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. The covalent complex was trapped by the addition of 0.1 m NaOH. The reaction mixture was neutralized and electrophoresed in an 8% sequencing gel. The dried gel was analyzed with the PhosphorImager Storm 760. Oligonucleotide Cleavage Assay—The substrate is a 39-base oligonucleotide 5′-GTTATGCAATGCGCTTTGGGCAAACCAAGAGAGCATAAC-3′ (PAGE purified from Genosys) labeled at the 5′ end with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. It has the same preferred topoisomerase I cleavage site CAAT↓GC as the single-stranded DNA substrate (15Kirkegaard K. Pflugfelder G. Wang J.C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The time course of cleavage was determined using 5 pmol of the substrate in a 30-μl reaction mixture of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA as described previously (16Cheng B. Feng J. Gadgil S. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8648-8654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Non-covalent Binding Assay—Non-covalent interaction between the enzyme and the oligonucleotide used in the cleavage reaction was determined by the gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The wild-type and mutant topoisomerase I was incubated with 1 pmol of the oligonucleotide in a 10-μl reaction mixture of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 12% glycerol at 37 °C for 5 min. Electrophoresis and quantitation of the enzyme-DNA complex were carried out as described previously (17Ahumada A. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. BMC Biochem. 2002; 3: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Limited Proteolytic Digestion—The wild-type and mutant topoisomerase I proteins were subject to limited digestion by the Glu-C endoproteinase (sequencing grade from Roche Applied Sciences) with 5 μg of the protein digested at a ratio of 1:100 in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol for the indicated lengths of time. After mixing with equal volume of 2× gel loading buffer for SDS gel and boiled for 5 min, the digestion mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in a 15% gel. The digestion products were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. In Vivo Complementation by the Topoisomerase I Mutants—The ability of these mutants to complement topA function in E. coli was tested after transformation of the expression plasmid derived from pRV10 into strain AS17 (F–topA(am) pLL1(TetrsupD43,74)) with a temperature-sensitive topoisomerase I protein encoded on the chromosome (18Zumstein L. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Wang Y. Lynch A.S. Chen S.-J. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1203-1209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). After overnight growth at 30 °C, dilutions of the transformants were plated on LB agar plates containing ampicillin and 2% glucose so that only a low level of recombinant topoisomerase I was expressed from the plasmid. After incubation at 30 and 42 °C, the ratios of colonies at the two temperatures were determined and compared with the plasmid expressing the wild-type topoisomerase I. Substitutions of Ser-192, Arg-195, and Gln-197 Resulted in Loss of Relaxation Activity—To test the requirement of the side chains of these residues for the relaxation activity of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I, the residues were mutated to alanines. The resulting mutant enzymes were purified and analyzed for relaxation activity for 30 min in a standard reaction buffer with 50 mm NaCl. The results (Fig. 2) showed that the alanine substitutions resulted in the most significant loss of activity at the Arg-195 position with relaxation activity reduced by > 500-fold, followed by the Gln-197 substitution (∼100-fold). The alanine substitutions at Ser-192 resulted in ∼10–20-fold lower activity. Substituting Arg-195 with the similarly charged lysine also had a significant effect on the relaxation activity (50–100-fold loss). The presence of a threonine with a hydroxyl side chain at position 192 improved the activity over the alanine substitution mutant to about one-tenth of the wild-type activity. DNA Cleavage Is Affected by Substitutions at Arg-195 and Gln-197 but Not Ser-192—We next determined the effect of the substitutions on cleavage of a 203-base-long single-stranded DNA (Fig. 3). Whereas the cleavage products for the R195A, R195K, and Q197A mutants were severely reduced, there was little change in the amount of cleavage products formed by the S192A and S192T mutant enzymes. The effect of the mutations on DNA cleavage by topoisomerase I was also measured using a shorter oligonucleotide substrate (Fig. 4). Again the cleavage rates of the S192A and S192T mutant enzymes were about the same as the wild-type topoisomerase. No cleavage could be detected for the R195A mutant enzyme (data not shown), and the cleavage rates for the R195K and Q197A mutants were about 20–40-fold lower than the wild-type topoisomerase.Fig. 4Cleavage of single-stranded 39-base oligonucleotide by wild-type and mutant topoisomerases. The 5′-end-labeled single-stranded oligonucleotide with a strong topoisomerase I cleavage site (5 pmol) was incubated with different amounts of wild-type or mutant enzyme, and the time course of cleavage was followed by gel electrophoresis and PhosphorImager analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The R195A and Q197A Mutant Enzymes Had Reduced Noncovalent Binding to DNA—The non-covalent binding of the mutant topoisomerase to the oligonucleotide substrate used in the cleavage assay was assessed using the gel mobility shift assay. The results (Fig. 5) showed that the S192A, S192T, and R195K mutant enzymes had a <2-fold change in non-covalent binding to the DNA substrate. The level of gel shift complex formed by the R195A and Q197A mutant enzymes was about 3–4-fold lower than that of the wild-type topoisomerase. Substitutions at Ser-192 Have No Effect on DNA Rejoining— There was no apparent effect from the substitutions at Ser-192 on the DNA cleavage activity of topoisomerase I. To determine whether deficiency in DNA rejoining affected the relaxation activity of the S192A and S192T mutants, DNA rejoining was assayed by first forming the cleaved complex with the 203base-long single-stranded DNA labeled at the 5′ end (lane 1, Fig. 6). The cleaved complex is salt-stable (20Liu L.F. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11082-11088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so addition of 1 m NaCl alone to the reaction mixture had no effect on the amount of DNA cleavage product (lane 2, Fig. 6). Addition of 4 mm MgCl2, however, resulted in the rejoining of the cleaved DNA and dissociation of enzyme in the presence of the high salt (lane 3, Fig. 6). The rejoining of the cleaved DNA by the S192A and S192T mutant enzymes was just as efficient as the wild-type topoisomerase I (Fig. 6), which indicated that the substitutions had no effect on this step of enzyme activity in the relaxation mechanism. The rejoining kinetics was very rapid and completed within 30 s of the addition of salt and Mg(II) for both the wild-type and the Ser-192 mutant enzymes (data not shown). The R195K Had a More Significant Change in Structure as Determined by Limited Proteolysis—Limited proteolysis with the Glu-C endoproteinase was used to compare the extent to which the enzyme structure might have been perturbed by mutations. The results (Fig. 7) showed that the digestion pattern of the R195K mutant had the greatest change when compared with the digestion pattern of the wild-type enzyme. The digestion patterns of the other mutant topoisomerases were quite similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. In Vivo Activity of the Mutant Topoisomerases—The in vivo activity of these mutant topoisomerases was measured by their ability to complement the temperature-sensitive topoisomerase I activity encoded by the chromosomal topA of strain AS17 (18Zumstein L. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Wang Y. Lynch A.S. Chen S.-J. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1203-1209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The number of colonies formed in the presence of the recombinant wild-type or mutant topoisomerase I was compared at 30 and 42 °C. Whereas the wild-type recombinant topoisomerase I could fully support growth at 42 °C, the number of viable colonies observed for the mutant topoisomerases at 42 °C was greater than one thousand fold less than that observed at 30 °C (Table I). The effects of the mutations on the in vivo topoisomerase activity required for viability account for the high degree of conservation of these amino acids among type IA topoisomerase sequences (11Perry K. Modragón A. Structure. 2003; 11: 1349-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12Caron P.R. Bjornsti M-A. Osheroff N. 1st Ed.

Harrison C. Cayley D.S. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2095-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 22Richey B. Cayley D.S. Mossing M.C. Kolka C. Anderson C.F. Farrar T.C. Record Jr., M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7157-7164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results (Fig. 8a) showed that the wild-type topoisomerase I relaxation activity did not decrease significantly when the 50 mm NaCl in the in vitro assay buffer was replaced with 0.2 m potassium glutamate. As intracellular glutamate concentration can be greater than 0.25 m depending on the external osmolarity (21Leirmo S. Harrison C. Cayley D.S. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2095-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 22Richey B. Cayley D.S. Mossing M.C. Kolka C. Anderson C.F. Farrar T.C. Record Jr., M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7157-7164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we compared the time course of relaxation by the mutant and wild-type topoisomerase I in the presence of 0.2 m potassium glutamate (Fig. 8b). All the mutant enzymes examined here could not complete the relaxation of the negatively supercoiled DNA even when present at a relatively high concentration (200 nm). The DNA binding and cleavage activities of the Ser-192 mutants were also examined in the presence of 0.2 m glutamate (Fig. 9). At this higher ionic strength, a 2-fold reduction in DNA binding was observed for the S192A mutant with the gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Nevertheless, even at this higher ionic strength that may more accurately resemble the in vivo conditions, there did not appear to be a significant effect on the DNA cleavage activity from the mutation at this position. Previous site-directed mutagenesis experiments from different laboratories have characterized a number of conserved residues in E. coli DNA topoisomerase I that were proposed to be interacting with the scissile phosphate in the DNA cleavage mechanism (23Chen S.-J. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6050-6056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24Zhu C.-X. Roche C.J. Papanicolaou N. Dipietrantonio A. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13237-13245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These residues include Tyr-319, Arg-321, and Glu-9. In addition, it was proposed that His-365 participates in a proton relay mechanism so that Glu-9 can donate a proton to the leaving 3′oxygen of the scissile phosphate (25Perry K. Mondragón A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13237-13245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The acidic triads of Asp-111, Asp-113, and Glu-115 have been shown to be involved in the binding of Mg2+, which is required for the relaxation activity (24Zhu C.-X. Roche C.J. Papanicolaou N.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5318-5322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Residues that interact with other phosphates on the DNA cleavage substrate have been implicated by crystallographic studies (10Changela A. DiGate R.J. Modragón A. Nature. 2001; 411: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Perry K. Modragón A. Structure. 2003; 11: 1349-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but their significance in the enzyme relaxation activity has not been investigated biochemically. The results presented here showed that alanine substitutions at Arg-195 and Gln-197 greatly diminished the cleavage activity of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I. This was in part because of the lower binding affinity of these mutants for the oligonucleotide cleavage substrate as determined by the gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The substitution of a lysine instead of an alanine in place of the arginine at position 195 improved the binding affinity of the mutant enzyme to closer to the wild-type level as assessed by the gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay, but it only marginally improved the relaxation activity because the cleavage activity was still >20-fold below that of the wild-type enzyme. Therefore the positively charged lysine substituted at position 195 might be able to participate in an electrostatic interaction with DNA, but it could not position the G strand DNA correctly for DNA cleavage to take place, perhaps because of the change in enzyme folding caused by the arginine to lysine substitution, as indicated by the proteolytic digestion data. The side chains of residues corresponding to Arg-195 and Gln-197 in E. coli DNA topoisomerase III were observed in the complex with single-stranded DNA to be in contact with the phosphodiester back-bone (10Changela A. DiGate R.J. Modragón A. Nature. 2001; 411: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The side chain of the highly conserved arginine interacts with the phosphate two nucleotides upstream of the scissile phosphate whereas the side chain of the invariant glutamine interacts with two phosphates three and four nucleotides upstream of the scissile phosphate simultaneously (10Changela A. DiGate R.J. Modragón A. Nature. 2001; 411: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These interactions are likely to assist the positioning of the scissile phosphate for nucleophilic attack by the tyrosine nucleophile. The arginine and the glutamine are at the base of an α helix that had shifted its position when the crystal structures of the closed topoisomerase alone (27Mondragón A. Digate R. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 1373-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the catalytically competent topoisomerase-ssDNA complex of E. coli DNA topoisomerase III were compared (10Changela A. DiGate R.J. Modragón A. Nature. 2001; 411: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 28Champoux J.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 199-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously by site-directed mutagenesis that loss of flexibility at Gly-194 preceding this α helix also drastically reduced the DNA cleavage and relaxation activity of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I (16Cheng B. Feng J. Gadgil S. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8648-8654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The results here provided biochemical evidence that the protein-DNA interactions involving Arg-197 and Gln-199 observed in the crystal structure of the catalytically competent topoisomerase III-ssDNA complex are important for DNA cleavage to take place. In addition, the phosphate interactions by Arg-197 and Gln-199 may also be important in the movement of the DNA binding domains after DNA cleavage, so that the cleaved DNA ends could be physically separated to create space for strand passage, as discussed recently (29Corbett K.D. Berger J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 95-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The serine at position 192 of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I is even more highly conserved among type IA DNA topoisomerases than the arginine at position 195 (11Perry K. Modragón A. Structure. 2003; 11: 1349-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12Caron P.R. Bjornsti M-A. Osheroff N. 1st Ed. DNA Topoisomerase Protocols: DNA Topology and Enzymes. 1. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 279-316Google Scholar). In the structure of the complex between E. coli DNA topoisomerase I and the single-stranded DNA postulated to correspond to an intermediate conformation between the closed state (9Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Modragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and the catalytically competent state (11Perry K. Modragón A. Structure. 2003; 11: 1349-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), Ser-192 was observed to contact a phosphate. Results from this study showed that although this phosphate interaction did not appear to be required for DNA cleavage to take place, mutation of Ser-192 could still have a significant effect on the overall relaxation reaction rate, both in vivo and at higher ionic strength conditions in vitro. It was unclear from the crystal structure whether the complex observed corresponds to a precleavage or to a postligation structure of the enzyme although it was postulated that the complex is representative of both stages (11Perry K. Modragón A. Structure. 2003; 11: 1349-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The results obtained here suggested that the direct interaction observed for Ser-192 in this crystal structure was not required for events leading to DNA cleavage. Nevertheless, this residue is highly conserved, and its mutation did have a significant effect on the relaxation activity. This is unlikely to be due to the effect of the mutations on protein folding, as the mutant enzymes retained the wild-type level of DNA cleavage activity. The alanine substitution at Ser-192, and to a lesser extent, the threonine substitution, could have a cumulative effect on the ability of the enzyme to go through the transitions from the ligated complex after each DNA strand passage event to a conformation required for the cycle of catalysis to repeat again. That might account for the overall effect of the mutation on the DNA relaxation activity. Alternatively, this interaction may be involved in the movement of the DNA binding domains needed for strand passage to take place. In summary, the results here showed that these three conserved amino acids in E. coli DNA topoisomerase I, although likely not involved directly in the chemistry of DNA cleavage and religation at the active site, could still be playing important roles in the different stages of the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme as they guide the protein-DNA interactions through the transitions of the different complexes required for change in DNA topology."

In this study we examined the 5′-untranslated region of human VEGF for control elements with the aim of regulating expression both in vitro and in vivo using oligonucleotide gene therapy. A potential control element was located, two sense oligonucleotides (S1 and S2) were designed based on its sequence, and a third oligonucleotide (S3) was designed as a control and mapped to the 16 base pairs immediately upstream. Retinal cells cultured in the presence of S1 and S2 resulted in a 2-fold increase of VEGF protein and a 1.5-fold increase in mRNA 24 h post-transfection whereas S3 had no significant effect (p > 0.05) compared with controls. Subsequent reporter gene studies confirmed the necessity of this element for up-regulation by S1. Further in vivo studies showed that S1 and S2 mediated an increase in VEGF protein in a rodent ocular model that resulted in angiogenesis.

Vascular development is a fundamental requirement for all tissue growth, and the absence of adequate tissue vascularization results in cells becoming deprived of oxygen and nutrients. This fact provides the stimulus for cells to produce angiogenic factors, which function to recruit new blood vessels into the deprived tissue. The most important of the angiogenic factors involved in new blood vessel formation is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 1The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; CFP, color fundus photography; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FA, fluorescein angiography; fg, femtogram; ODN, oligonucleotide; RPE, retinal pigment epithelial; UTR, untranslated region; RT-PCR, real time PCR. which is highly regulated and consists of four isoforms encoded by a single gene via alternate splicing (1Shima D.T.

The importance of VEGF-mediated vascularization in disease states makes it an attractive target for gene therapies. Several methods of down-regulating VEGF for the treatment of tumors and ocular neovascularization are currently being explored (10Carrasquillo K.G. Ricker J.A. Rigas I.K. Miller J.W. Gragoudas E.S.

In addition, we have previously described a sense oligonucleotide (DS-085) that targets the 5′-UTR of the VEGF gene and has proven effective at down-regulating the transcription and subsequent translation of VEGF both in vitro and in vivo (13Garrett K.L. Shen W.Y. Rakoczy P.E. J. Gene Med. 2001; 3: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action has been postulated to be due to Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding of the oligonucleotide (ODN) within the major groove of the duplex DNA, causing polymerase arrest (14Alunni-Fabbroni M.

Similar to the regulatory regions of other genes, DS-085 was found to be rich in GA purine residues (19Arnold R. Maueler W. Bassili G. Lutz M. Burke L. Epplen T.J. Renkawitz R. Gene. 2000; 253: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Genuario R.R. Perry R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4388-4395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). An examination of the 5′-UTR sequence was therefore made in an attempt to discover other potential homopurine regulatory sequences involved in VEGF expression. In this article we report on the discovery of a novel control element within the 5′-UTR of the VEGF gene that may represent the binding site of a destabilization protein. Oligonucleotide Design—The 5′-UTR sequence of human VEGF (GenBank™ accession number NM_003376) was examined for the presence of homopurine regions that may represent potential regulatory sites. Sense ODNs 1 and 2 (S1 and S2) were subsequently designed to recognize the first and final 16 bp, respectively, of a homopurinehomopyrimidine sequence identified from base pair -265 to -223 from the ATG start codon. In addition, a third sense ODN (S3) was designed and represented the 16 bp immediately 5′ to S1 and was used as a control. Oligo DS-085 has been described previously (13Garrett K.L. Shen W.Y. Rakoczy P.E. J. Gene Med. 2001; 3: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were obtained from Proligo (Boulder, CO) and synthesized with a phosphorothioate (S) backbone. In Vitro Oligonucleotide VEGF Inhibition Assay—A human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell line (RPE 51) was grown in culture and used to assess the effect that S1, S2, S3, and DS-085 have on the production of VEGF protein and mRNA. Cells were seeded into 2 × 6 well plates (35-mm diameter) at ∼4 × 105 cells per well and allowed to grow in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% streptomycin, and penicillin at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until 80% confluence was reached. Cytofectin (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) was used per the manufacturer's instructions to deliver the ODNs into the cells at a final concentration of 1 μm. Control groups consisted of cells transfected with cytofectin alone and null treated cells, which were not manipulated in any way. Following transfection, one of the plates was transferred to a CO2 incubator and grown under normoxic condition at 5% CO2. The other plate was placed in a hypoxic incubator (2% O2 and 5% CO2), and each was grown for 24 h. After this time, the media were collected from both the normoxic and hypoxic grown cells for an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a commercially available kit (CYTELISA™; Cytimmune Sciences, College Park, MD) to determine the level of VEGF protein expression. The ELISA was performed per the manufacturer's instructions using 100 μl of undiluted culture media. The cells from each well were harvested by trypsinization and pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was washed twice in isotonic saline and resuspended in 250 μl of the same. An A600 reading was taken to determine cell density, which was used to normalize the VEGF concentration. Levels of mRNA transcript were determined using RT-PCR. Cells were treated with 600 μl of Trizol (Qiagen, Clifton Hill, Victoria, Australia) directly in the culture wells 24 h post-transfection. The lysed suspension was transferred to a microfuge tube where chloroform (200 μl) was added, and the solution was subjected to a vortex to ensure complete mixing. The aqueous phase containing the total RNA was removed to a new microfuge tube, and 1 volume of isopropanol was added to precipitate the total RNA. The total RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was washed in 70% ethanol. The ethanol was aspirated, the pellet was air-dried and resuspended in 200 μl of nuclease-free water, and the concentration was determined spectrometrically. An Omniscript™ RT kit (Qiagen) was used for the production of the first strand cDNA per the manufacturer's instructions starting with 200 ng of total RNA using an oligo(dT) primer in a final volume of 20 μl. Directly from this reaction, 1 μl was used as a template for the PCR of an internal VEGF fragment in addition to a β-actin fragment, which was used as an internal control. VEGF primers consisted of the sense 5′-CATCACGAAGTGGTGAAGTT-3′ and the antisense 5′-AACGCTCCAGGACTTATACC-3′. Primers used to amplify β-actin (GenBank™ accession number NM_007393) consisted of the sense 5′-AGGCACCAGGGCGTGAT-3′ and the antisense 5′-TTAATGTCACGCACGATTTC-3′. Both sets of primers (Proligo) were included with the following reaction components in a final volume of 25 μl: 2.5 μl of 10× reaction buffer, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 μm each dNTP, 6 pmol of each primer, and 1 unit of Tth+ polymerase (Fisher Biotech, Perth, Western Australia, Australia). A touchdown cycling reaction was used and consisted of an initial denaturing step of 94 °C for 2 min followed by seven cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 65 °C for 10 s with a drop of 1 °C per cycle, and 72 °C for 30 s. This was then followed by 41 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 58 °C for 10 s, and 71 °C for 30 s. Sample Statistics—The transfections were performed in quadruplet sets for statistical analysis. Results were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by a post hoc Fisher's least squares difference analysis with 95% confidence limits using the GB-Stat™ statistical software package (Dynamic Microsystems, Silver Springs, MD). Reporter Gene Analysis—Plasmids were constructed to examine the role of various sections of the 5′-UTR in regulating VEGF expression both in the presence and absence of up-regulating ODNs. Initially, the entire 1039 bp of the human VEGF 5′-UTR was RT-PCR amplified from mRNA extracted from cultured human RPE 51 cells and subcloned into pGEM T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI) to produce pGEM T-UTR. The integrity of this clone was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Subsequently, the entire UTR was removed by digestion with ApaI and SalI (all restriction enzymes were sourced from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and subcloned into the ApaI and XhoI site of the reporter plasmid (pΔUTR) consisting of the cytomegalovirus strong promoter linked to the secreted alkaline phosphatase reporter gene to produce pUTR-W. Two further reporter plasmids were constructed by subcloning the proximal 703-bp ApaI-XmnI fragment and the distal 396-bp XmnIEcoRI fragment of pGEM T-UTR into the ApaI-EcoRV and the EcoRVEcoRI sites of pΔUTR, respectively, to produce pUTR-L and pUTR-S. To examine the effect on reporter gene activity, 0.8 μg of each construct was used per well to transiently transfect RPE 51 cells cultured in 24-well plates using the transfection agent LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection was allowed to proceed for 5 h, at which time the growth media were replaced with fresh media both with and without supplementation with a 1 μm concentration of S1 conjugated to the transfection agent cytofectin (Gene Therapy Systems). Media were sampled 24 h later and analyzed for secreted alkaline phosphatase activity by chemiluminescent detection on a TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Transfections were performed in quadruplet sets, and the results were expressed as a percentage of relative light units compared with the pΔUTR control. Analysis of the results consisted of analysis of variance with post hoc Fisher's least squares difference analysis with 95% confidence limits. Injections and in Vivo Analysis—All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the animal use guidelines of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology and were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Western Australia. Oligonucleotide delivery to the anterior chamber was carried out on 6-8-week-old non-pigmented RCS/rdy+ rats that had been anesthetized by an intramuscular injection of ketamine (50 mg kg-1 body weight) and xylazine (8 mg kg-1 body weight), followed by topical application of proparacaine hydrochloride to the eye. Two and one-half microliters of a 1 mm oligonucleotide solution or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol) were injected into the anterior chamber of both eyes of each rat via the temporal limbus using a 32-gauge needle attached to a 5-μl Hamilton syringe after the same amount of aqueous humor was drained. Ophthalmologic examinations of the eyes were performed 7 days post-injection and photographed using a slit lamp camera. Sub retinal injections were performed on 8- to 9-week-old non-pigmented RCS/rdy+ rats and C57 BL/6J mice of the same age. The injection technique used has been described previously (21Axel D.I. Spyridopoulos I. Riessen R. Runge H. Viebahn R. Karsch K.R. J. Vasc. Res. 2000; 37 (303-304): 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, the conjunctiva was cut close to the limbus to expose the sclera, which was then punctured with a 30-guage needle. A 32-guage needle was passed through this hole in a tangential direction under an operating microscope. Two microliters of oligonucleotide were delivered into the subretinal space of each eye. The needle was kept in the subretinal space for 1 min, withdrawn gently, and antibiotic ointment was applied to the wound site. Ophthalmologic examinations were performed 7 days post-injection and consisted of color fundus photography (CFP) and fluorescein angiography (FA). A second group of similarly injected rats were euthanized 7 days post-injection, and the eyes were enucleated and placed into 200 μl of phosphate buffered saline containing protease inhibitors. The eyes were thoroughly homogenized and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. To determine the concentration of VEGF in the eyes, 50 μl of supernatant was used in an ELISA specific for mouse/rat VEGF (Quantikine; R&D Systems). The concentration was normalized against total protein concentrations of the supernatant. ELISA results were analyzed using analysis of variance with a post hoc Dunnnett's procedure (GB-Stat™). Regulation of VEGF Expression—S1,S2,S3, and DS-085 were transfected into the RPE 51 cell line, and the effects of VEGF translation and transcription were measured using ELISA and RT-PCR, respectively. ELISA (Fig. 1) revealed that both S1 (1073 ± 64 pg ml-1) and S2 (969 ± 60 pg ml-1) facilitated a statistically significant (p < 0.01) up-regulation of VEGF protein by ∼2-fold as compared with the non-transfected control (578 ± 63 pg ml-1). ODN S3 (593 ± 33 pg ml-1) had no significant effect (p > 0.05), whereas the transfection agent cytofectin mediated a slight decrease in VEGF expression (508 ± 38 pg ml-1). However, this result was not found to be significant (p > 0.05). To examine the effects on VEGF at the transcriptional level, total RNA was extracted from cells transfected with S1, S2, S3, and DS-085 and subsequently used as a template for RT-PCR (Fig. 2a). The profile for mRNA levels in the transfected cells, as determined by densitometry of the PCR products (Fig. 2b), reflected the protein concentration profile. Transfection with S1 and S2 mediated an increase in the levels of VEGF mRNA by a factor of 1.5 as compared with the non-transfected control 24 h after transfection. However, the increase in mRNA mediated by S1 and S2 was not found to be proportional to the increase in protein concentration. The previously described oligonucleotide DS-085 decreased the level of mRNA by 57.5%, which was directly proportional to the decrease in protein. This result indicated that the mechanism of down-regulation by DS-085 was separate to and distinct from the mechanism of up-regulation of protein by S1 and S2. Transfection with the S3 oligonucleotide resulted in no significant effect as compared with the effect on the control samples, which was the same in regard to protein concentration. Similarly, transfection with vehicle (cytofectin) alone produced a slight decrease (5%) in VEGF mRNA equivalent to that found for the protein reduction and may be reflective of the slight cytotoxic effect known to be associated with cytofectin (21Axel D.I. Spyridopoulos I. Riessen R. Runge H. Viebahn R. Karsch K.R. J. Vasc. Res. 2000; 37 (303-304): 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Reporter Gene Analysis—Retinal cells were transiently transfected with the reporter gene constructs and cultured in both the presence and the absence of S1. Media were sampled and tested for alkaline phosphatase activity using a chemiluminescent detection method, and the results are summarized in Fig. 3. Plasmid pΔUTR showed strong reporter gene activity and remained unaffected when cultured in the presence of S1 (data not shown). Transfection with plasmid pUTR-W, which contains the entire VEGF 5′-UTR, resulted in a significant (p < 0.01) decrease (65%) in reporter gene activity compared with pΔUTR. However, when cultured in the presence of S1, reporter gene activity significantly (p < 0.01) increased 1.79-fold to be 62.9 ± 5.4% of pΔUTR activity. When transfected with pUTR-L in which the proposed destabilizing element was absent, the decrease in reporter activity as compared with pΔUTR was significantly less (p < 0.01) than that of pUTR-W, indicating a more stable transcript. In addition, we only see a small increase in reporter activity when cultured in the presence of S1 (63.5 ± 4.3% to 73.9 ± 3.3% compared with pΔUTR), which was not found to be significant (p > 0.05). In cells transfected with pUTR-S, which comprises the 3′-distal end of the VEGF 5′-UTR and contains the destabilizing element, we again see reporter gene activity significantly (p < 0.01) increased by 1.39-fold when cultured in the presence of S1, indicating a stabilizing effect. In Vivo Analysis—To determine whether the in vitro observations would translate into an in vivo effect, S1, S2, and S3 were injected into the anterior chamber of rat eyes. Subsequent ophthalmologic examination showed strong neovascularization in the iris of rat eyes 7 days following injection with S1 and S2, (Fig. 4), but no effect was observed in rat eyes injected with S3 or vehicle. This indicates that the oligonucleotides were able to mediate the up-regulation of VEGF in the eye and produce an angiogenic response. The result observed in the iris was reflected in rats that were injected in the subretinal space with S1, S2, and S3. Eyes injected with S3 remained clear of angiogenesis when viewed using CFP and FA (Fig. 5, a and b, respectively) for the duration of the experiment. However, a strong angiogenic response was observed in eyes 7 days post-injection with S1 and S2 when viewed using CFP. Neovascularization occurred some distance from the injection site and appeared as a distinct red band of blood vessels extending across the retina (Fig. 5c). Further examination using fluorescein angiography confirmed the formation of new vessels, which appears as hyperfluorescence (Fig. 5d) due to the “leaky” nature that blood vessels possess during angiogenesis. In addition, FA revealed the presence of microaneurisms (not shown) in eyes injected with S1 and S2. Later examinations performed 14 days post-injection of S1 and S2 revealed the occurrence of intraretinal hemorrhage in eyes injected with S1 and S2 that appears as black spots using CFP (Fig. 5c) and as hypo-fluorescence using fluorescein angiography (Fig. 5f). The intraretinal hemorrhage increased in severity 21 days post-injection (Fig. 5g) and appears as a large hypo-fluorescent area using FA (Fig. 5h). The observations detailed above were closely paralleled in a similar mouse model following subretinal injection where leakiness, micro aneurysms, and intraretinal hemorrhage were also observed in eyes injected with S1 and S2 7 days post-injection, whereas eyes injected with S3 retained a normal appearance (photographs not shown). To correlate the angiogenic response seen in vivo to the results found in vitro, ELISA was used to assay the VEGF protein concentrations from the eyes of rats injected with S1, S2, and S3. The results (Fig. 6) show that both S1 and S2 mediated a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the concentration of VEGF protein within the eye (2952 ± 193 fg mg-1 and 2404 ± 124 fg mg-1 of total protein respectively) compared with the vehicle-injected control (1930 ± 92 fg mg-1 of total protein). In addition, consistent to the in vitro results and in vivo observations, S3 was unable to significantly change the concentration of ocular VEGF (1768 ± 45 fg mg-1 of total protein). Sequence Comparison—Cross-species comparisons of VEGF 5′-UTR sequences between bovine (GenBank™ accession number NM_174216), murine (GenBank™ accession number NM_009505), and human have revealed a high level of conservation for the S1 to S2 region between human and bovine, but the murine 5′-UTR revealed a complete lack of the S1 sequence (Fig. 7). No sequence information was available for the 5′-UTR of the rat and, therefore, no direct comparison could be made. Controlled regulation of VEGF in vivo is important in maintaining the health of many tissues and cells types. However, increased levels of VEGF associated with ischemic conditions leads to a variety of angiogenic ocular diseases, including diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity (22Adamis A.P.

Med. 1994; 331: 1480-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (3436) Google Scholar), in addition to promoting vasculogenesis in cancerous tissues (24Ding I. Liu W. Sun J. Paoni S.F. Hernady E. Fenton B.M.

Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1998; 17: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Central to the regulation of VEGF is the presence of both a 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR, both of which contain many regulatory elements, including hypoxia and glucose response elements (26Iida K. Kawakami Y. Sone H. Suzuki H. Yatoh S. Isobe K. Takekoshi K. Yamada N. Life Sci. 2002; 71: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), in addition to stabilizing and destabilizing elements (8Dibbens J.A. Miller D.L. Damert A. Risau W. Vadas M.A. Goodall G.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 907-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this study we report on the discovery of a novel control element within the 5′-UTR of the human VEGF gene that may act as a target site for a destabilizing protein in addition to providing further insight into its regulation. Two sense oligonucleotides (S1 and S2) were designed to resemble a potential regulatory region within the 5′-UTR of the VEGF gene. A third ODN (S3) was designed as a control and mapped to the 16 bp immediately 5′ to S1. Results from the in vitro studies demonstrated that S1 and S2 mediated a 2-fold increase in protein production and up to a 1.5-fold increase in the level of a mRNA transcript. This indicates that the sequences in the 5′-UTR represented by S1 and S2 contain regulatory elements involved in the modulation of VEGF production. Possible mechanisms for VEGF protein up-regulation by S1 and S2 include competitive inhibition of either a mRNA destabilizing protein or a transcriptional repressor protein. In the case of the latter, transcriptional repressor proteins have been described previously (19Arnold R. Maueler W. Bassili G. Lutz M. Burke L. Epplen T.J. Renkawitz R. Gene. 2000; 253: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Genuario R.R. Perry R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4388-4395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and share a common theme of recognizing the variations of a homopurine GA-type sequence consensus motif similar to the sequence found in S1 and S2. However, our data suggest that S1 and S2 are competing for the recognition site of an mRNA destabilizing protein. If the mechanism of up-regulation were mediated by increased mRNA production through the inhibition of a repressor protein, we would see a proportional increase between protein and mRNA. However, this was not the case for S1 and S2 where protein levels were increased by 2-fold compared with the control, whereas mRNA was only increased by 1.5 and 1.25 times, respectively. Levels of mRNA are determined by the equilibrium that exists between synthesis and degradation; therefore, an increase in stability will reduce degradation and cause an equilibrium shift resulting in higher levels of mRNA being present without an increase in mRNA transcription. The improved mRNA stability and, hence, the increased half-life will result in a proportionally greater amount of protein produced per molecule of mRNA. In addition, stabilization/destabilization of mRNA has been shown previously to be the mechanism associated with increases in VEGF protein during periods of hypoxia (27Shima D.T. Deutsch U. D'Amore P.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and has been well documented as playing a role in the regulation of other cellular elements such as transferrin receptors (28Koeller D.M. Horowitz J.A. Casey J.L. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7778-7782Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 29Mullner E.W. Kuhn L.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), elastin (30Hew Y. Lau C. Grzelczak Z. Keeley F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24857-24864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and resistin (31Kawashima J. Tsuruzoe K. Motoshima H. Shirakami A. Sakai K. Hirashima Y. Toyonaga T. Araki E. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The possibility of destabilizing elements being present within the 5′-UTR of the VEGF mRNA transcript has been reported previously (8Dibbens J.A. Miller D.L. Damert A. Risau W. Vadas M.A. Goodall G.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 907-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), but no definitive consensus sequence has yet been described. Reporter gene studies have been used to confirm that the activity of S1 and S2 was exerted at the transcriptional level. The presence of the many regulatory factors located within the 5′-UTR of VEGF makes it difficult to explain the overall effect that truncation has on reporter gene activity. However, we were able to show that removal of the 3′-distal end of the 5′-UTR (pUTR-L), which contained the proposed regulatory element, resulted in a reduced down-regulatory effect compared with the full UTR construct (pUTR-W) in addition to a loss of up-regulation of reporter product when cultured in the presence of S1. Conversely, cells transfected with reporter plasmids containing the complete 5′-UTR, and the fragment containing the proposed destabilizing element (pUTR-W and pUTR-S, respectively) showed significant increases in reporter gene activity when cultured in the presence of S1. It should be noted that the relative increase in reporter activity was less for pUTR-S (1.39-fold) than for the complete pUTR-W (1.79-fold), which was a comparable increase over that found in the in vitro ELISA assays. Use of computer modeling has shown the 5′-UTR of VEGF to possess a complex secondary structure that is crucial for normal functioning of the gene (5Akiri G. Nahari D. Finkelstein Y. Le S.Y. Elroy-Stein O. Levi B.Z. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 32Huez I. Creancier L. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Prats A.C. Prats H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6178-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that truncation of the 5′-UTR would cause an alteration in the folding pattern and affect the normal functions of the various control elements, resulting in reduced functioning such as that described above. To study the effects of S1, S2, and S3 on VEGF regulation in vivo, a rodent ocular model was chosen. VEGF isoforms are the same for all tissues, and the eye makes an attractive organ to use because the effects on ocular vascularization by changes in VEGF levels have been well described (review in Ref. 33Witmer A.N. Vrensen G.F. Van Noorden C.J. Schlingemann R.O. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2003; 22: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). In addition, the vasculature of the eye can be readily studied through real time ophthalmologic examination. When introduced to the anterior chamber of the rat eye, a strong neovascular response in the iris was observed for both S1 and S2. Likewise, subretinal injection of S1 and S2 in both rats and mice resulted in a similar response in the retina in addition to the formation of microaneurysms and leakage associated with the growth of new blood vessels. This pattern of neovascularization can also be observed in a rodent model with an elevated expression of a VEGF transgene (34Baffi J. Byrnes G. Chan C.C. Csaky K.G. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3582-3589PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in patients suffering from diabetic retinopathy (35Moore J. Bagley S. Ireland G. McLeod D. Boulton M.E. J. Anat. 1999; 194: 89-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The injection of S3 resulted in no observable response as was seen in the in vitro study. This provided a strong indication that the presence of S1 and S2 mediated an increase in the level VEGF protein with the effect of stimulating neovascularization. To test this hypothesis, the concentration of VEGF in rat eyes 7 days post-injection with S1,S2, and S3 was calculated. Eyes injected with S1 and S2 showed significantly elevated VEGF protein levels (1.59- and 1.25-fold, respectively) compared with the vehicle-injected control when measured using ELISA, whereas no difference was recorded in S3-injected eyes. Although VEGF has been identified as a highly potent angiogenic factor, to date no data exists on the minimal increase required to promote an angiogenic response in the retina. Previous studies using RPE cells have shown that the up-regulation of VEGF due to hypoxic conditions to be 1.3- to 1.5-fold (36Blaauwgeers H.G. Holtkamp G.M. Rutten H. Witmer A.N. Koolwijk P. Partanen T.A. Alitalo K. Kroon M.E. Kijlstra A. van Hinsbergh V.W. Schlingemann R.O. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 421-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In addition, VEGF was preferentially secreted to the basal side of the cell to yield a 2- to 7-fold higher accumulation of VEGF on the basal side as compared with the apical side, which may prove to be the more important factor involved in ocular angiogenesis. Comparisons of published sequences of the 5′-UTR show some variation in the sequence region proposed for the presence of a destabilizing element. However, S1 and S2 both mediate a response in the mouse model, which lacks the S1 sequence, thereby providing evidence that the inhibition was due to a shorter consensus sequence common to both S1 and S2. Responses to hypoxia are dependent on the presence of the hypoxia response element, which consists of a 6-bp core consensus sequence (37Su H. Arakawa-Hoyt J. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9480-9485Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Similarly, low levels of glucose can mediate and increase in VEGF through the glucose response element (26Iida K. Kawakami Y. Sone H. Suzuki H. Yatoh S. Isobe K. Takekoshi K. Yamada N. Life Sci. 2002; 71: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). S1 and S2 both contain the element (T/A)GGGG, which may represent the core recognition sequence of a destabilizing protein. This research provides the strongest evidence to date for the existence of a destabilizing element within the 5′-UTR of the VEGF gene. In addition, we have shown the potential location of these elements and discussed their importance in the regulation of VEGF protein production. Further research will evaluate the protein-mRNA relationship and how this may translate into a disease state. This understanding may lead to potential treatments for ischemic tissues such as that found in the heart following a myocardial infarct.
