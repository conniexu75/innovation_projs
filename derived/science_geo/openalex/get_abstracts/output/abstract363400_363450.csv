https://openalex.org/W2074873270,"c-Myc is an oncogene involved in many forms of cancer. Proteomic analysis of human P-493 B lymphoma cells and PC3 prostate cancer cells shows that c-Myc regulates the microRNAs miR-23a and miR-23b to increase the expression of the mitochondrial enzyme glutaminase. This leads to enhanced glutamine metabolism and contributes to the metabolic changes in Myc-driven cancers. This paper shows that c-Myc regulates the microRNAs miR-23a and miR-23b to increase the expression of the mitochondrial enzyme glutaminase. This leads to enhanced glutamine metabolism and contributes to the metabolic changes in c-Myc-driven cancers. Altered glucose metabolism in cancer cells is termed the Warburg effect, which describes the propensity of most cancer cells to take up glucose avidly and convert it primarily to lactate, despite available oxygen1,2. Notwithstanding the renewed interest in the Warburg effect, cancer cells also depend on continued mitochondrial function for metabolism, specifically glutaminolysis that catabolizes glutamine to generate ATP and lactate3. Glutamine, which is highly transported into proliferating cells4,5, is a major source of energy and nitrogen for biosynthesis, and a carbon substrate for anabolic processes in cancer cells, but the regulation of glutamine metabolism is not well understood1,6. Here we report that the c-Myc (hereafter referred to as Myc) oncogenic transcription factor, which is known to regulate microRNAs7,8 and stimulate cell proliferation9, transcriptionally represses miR-23a and miR-23b, resulting in greater expression of their target protein, mitochondrial glutaminase, in human P-493 B lymphoma cells and PC3 prostate cancer cells. This leads to upregulation of glutamine catabolism10. Glutaminase converts glutamine to glutamate, which is further catabolized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle for the production of ATP or serves as substrate for glutathione synthesis11. The unique means by which Myc regulates glutaminase uncovers a previously unsuspected link between Myc regulation of miRNAs, glutamine metabolism, and energy and reactive oxygen species homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2136023563,"A key function of blood vessels, to supply oxygen, is impaired in tumors because of abnormalities in their endothelial lining. PHD proteins serve as oxygen sensors and may regulate oxygen delivery. We therefore studied the role of endothelial PHD2 in vessel shaping by implanting tumors in PHD2(+/-) mice. Haplodeficiency of PHD2 did not affect tumor vessel density or lumen size, but normalized the endothelial lining and vessel maturation. This resulted in improved tumor perfusion and oxygenation and inhibited tumor cell invasion, intravasation, and metastasis. Haplodeficiency of PHD2 redirected the specification of endothelial tip cells to a more quiescent cell type, lacking filopodia and arrayed in a phalanx formation. This transition relied on HIF-driven upregulation of (soluble) VEGFR-1 and VE-cadherin. Thus, decreased activity of an oxygen sensor in hypoxic conditions prompts endothelial cells to readjust their shape and phenotype to restore oxygen supply. Inhibition of PHD2 may offer alternative therapeutic opportunities for anticancer therapy."

Such vaccines typically induce central memory T cells that must expand before gaining full antiviral functions. Picker and his colleagues show that a new replicating anti-SIV vaccine, based on the persistently infecting cytomegalovirus, which preferentially induces effector memory T cells in mucosal tissues, can reduce the likelihood that the macaques become infected in the first place ( pages 244–246 ). The rapid onset of massive, systemic viral replication during primary HIV or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection and the immune evasion capabilities of these viruses pose fundamental problems for vaccines that depend upon initial viral replication to stimulate effector T cell expansion and differentiation1,2,3,4,5. We hypothesized that vaccines designed to maintain differentiated effector memory T cell (TEM cell) responses5,6 at viral entry sites might improve efficacy by impairing viral replication at its earliest stage2, and we have therefore developed SIV protein-encoding vectors based on rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV), the prototypical inducer of life-long TEM cell responses7,8,9. RhCMV vectors expressing SIV Gag, Rev-Tat-Nef and Env persistently infected rhesus macaques, regardless of preexisting RhCMV immunity, and primed and maintained robust, SIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ TEM cell responses (characterized by coordinate tumor necrosis factor, interferon-γ and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β expression, cytotoxic degranulation and accumulation at extralymphoid sites) in the absence of neutralizing antibodies. Compared to control rhesus macaques, these vaccinated rhesus macaques showed increased resistance to acquisition of progressive SIVmac239 infection upon repeated limiting-dose intrarectal challenge, including four macaques who controlled rectal mucosal infection without progressive systemic dissemination. These data suggest a new paradigm for AIDS vaccine development—vaccines capable of generating and maintaining HIV-specific TEM cells might decrease the incidence of HIV acquisition after sexual exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2136883776,"Necrotic cell corpses accumulate in tissues as a result of injury or impaired clearance of apoptotic cells, and can induce an inflammatory response that initiates tissue repair. The recently described dendritic C-type lectin receptor CLEC9A, also called DNGR-1, is shown to sense necrotic debris by recognizing a preformed signal that is exposed on necrotic cells, and to mediate cross presentation of dead cell-associated antigens. This study shows that dendritic cells use the C-type lectin CLEC9A to sense necrotic cell debris and to mediate cross-presentation of dead-cell-associated antigens. Injury or impaired clearance of apoptotic cells leads to the pathological accumulation of necrotic corpses, which induce an inflammatory response that initiates tissue repair1. In addition, antigens present in necrotic cells can sometimes provoke a specific immune response2,3,4 and it has been argued that necrosis could explain adaptive immunity in seemingly infection-free situations, such as after allograft transplantation or in spontaneous and therapy-induced tumour rejection5,6. In the mouse, the CD8α+ subset of dendritic cells phagocytoses dead cell remnants and cross-primes CD8+ T cells against cell-associated antigens7. Here we show that CD8α+ dendritic cells use CLEC9A (also known as DNGR-1), a recently-characterized C-type lectin8,9,10, to recognize a preformed signal that is exposed on necrotic cells. Loss or blockade of CLEC9A does not impair the uptake of necrotic cell material by CD8α+ dendritic cells, but specifically reduces cross-presentation of dead-cell-associated antigens in vitro and decreases the immunogenicity of necrotic cells in vivo. The function of CLEC9A requires a key tyrosine residue in its intracellular tail that allows the recruitment and activation of the tyrosine kinase SYK, which is also essential for cross-presentation of dead-cell-associated antigens. Thus, CLEC9A functions as a SYK-coupled C-type lectin receptor to mediate sensing of necrosis by the principal dendritic-cell subset involved in regulating cross-priming to cell-associated antigens."

Here, we use a neural silencing screen to identify neurons required for a simple Drosophila taste behavior and characterize a neural population that controls a specific subprogram of this behavior. By silencing and activating subsets of the defined cell population, we identify the neurons involved in the taste behavior as a pair of motor neurons located in the subesophageal ganglion (SOG). The motor neurons are activated by sugar stimulation of gustatory neurons and inhibited by bitter compounds; however, experiments utilizing split-GFP detect no direct connections between the motor neurons and primary sensory neurons, indicating that further study will be necessary to elucidate the circuitry bridging these populations. Combined, these results provide a general strategy and a valuable starting point for future taste circuit analysis.

Combined, these results provide a general strategy and a valuable starting point for future taste circuit analysis. Animals rely heavily on sensory cues to guide their behavior. In general, information about an organism's environment is transformed into neural activity by peripheral sensory neurons that respond to stimuli such as touch, light, or chemicals. This information is relayed to neural circuits that process the information into a form that is read by motor programs directly driving behavior. It has been suggested that circuits may be assembled from simple “motifs” of a few synaptically connected neurons that are used repeatedly in information processing networks (Milo et al., 2002Milo R. Shen-Orr S. Itzkovitz S. Kashtan N. Chklovskii D. Alon U. Network motifs: simple building blocks of complex networks.Science. 2002; 298: 824-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). Thus, studying simple circuits in model organisms may yield insight into neural processing in more complex nervous systems. Studies of small neural networks in invertebrates, including the Aplysia gill withdrawal reflex, the lobster stomatogastric nervous system, the leech heartbeat, and the C. elegans olfactory system, are providing fundamental insight into how neural connectivity and function dictate behavior and allow for behavioral plasticity. Much less is understood about neural processing as the scale of the neural circuit increases in complexity from tens of neurons to hundreds or thousands. The fly brain consists of about 100,000 neurons, a level of complexity midrange between the nervous systems of C. elegans and mammals. The ability to couple molecular and genetic analyses with studies of cell activity and behavior in Drosophila provides a powerful approach to examine how a complex nervous system orchestrates behavior. Much work remains to be done in mapping connectivity in the fly brain. The olfactory system of Drosophila is under heavy investigation, yet behavioral circuits are largely unmapped beyond the second-order projection neurons (Datta et al., 2008Datta S.R. Vasconcelos M.L.

Understanding of the gustatory system is even more rudimentary; in this case, only primary gustatory neurons have been identified (Thorne et al., 2004Thorne N. Chromey C. Bray S. Amrein H.

Further mapping of taste circuits is an important goal that will lead to insight into how information that is critical to the animal's survival—whether a substance is nutritious or toxic—is wired in the brain to produce reliable and appropriate behavioral responses. Fruit flies detect taste compounds using specialized chemosensory bristles located on the proboscis, internal mouthparts, legs, wings, and ovipositor (Singh, 1997Singh R.N. Neurobiology of the gustatory systems of Drosophila and some terrestrial insects.Microsc. Res. Tech. 1997; 39: 547-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, Stocker, 1994Stocker R.F. The organization of the chemosensory system in Drosophila melanogaster: a review.Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 275: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Each chemosensory bristle is innervated by two to four gustatory neurons and a mechanosensory cell (Falk et al., 1976Falk R. Bleiser-Avivi N. Atidia J. Labellar taste organs of Drosophila melanogaster.J. Morphol. 1976; 150: 327-341Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Dendrites of gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) extend to the bristle tip, allowing direct contact between receptor molecules on dendrites and chemicals in the environment. Taste information is relayed to the central nervous system by GRN axons, which project either directly to the subesophageal ganglion (SOG) of the fly brain or peripheral ganglia (Rajashekhar and Singh, 1994aRajashekhar K.P.

Two striking characteristics make the fly gustatory system an ideal system for understanding how neural circuits transform sensory information into behavior. First, sensory neurons detect different taste qualities and mediate different behaviors, creating the basis for studying a simple case of sensory integration. GRNs appear to be separable into at least three distinct classes based on molecular and functional characterizations. Neurons expressing the Gr5a gene, one of 68 members in the putative gustatory receptor gene family, respond to sugars and elicit acceptance behavior (Dahanukar et al., 2007Dahanukar A. Lei Y.T.

The enhancer trap E409-Gal4 marks a second neural population that responds to carbon dioxide and mediates acceptance (Fischler et al., 2007Fischler W. Kong P. Marella S. Scott K. The detection of carbonation by the Drosophila gustatory system.Nature. 2007; 448: 1054-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). By contrast, neurons expressing Gr66a respond to a wide array of bitter compounds and mediate avoidance behavior (Marella et al., 2006Marella S. Fischler W. Kong P. Asgarian S. Rueckert E. Scott K. Imaging taste responses in the fly brain reveals a functional map of taste category and behavior.Neuron. 2006; 49: 285-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2004Wang Z.

Gr5a, E409, and Gr66a neurons send axons to distinct areas of the SOG, creating a map of taste quality at the first relay in the brain (Marella et al., 2006Marella S. Fischler W. Kong P. Asgarian S.

Imaging taste responses in the fly brain reveals a functional map of taste category and behavior.Neuron. 2006; 49: 285-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, Thorne et al., 2004Thorne N.

Singhvi A. Kong P. Scott K. Taste representations in the Drosophila brain.Cell. 2004; 117: 981-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). However, how this spatial map of taste quality is translated into behavior remains mysterious. The second advantage of the gustatory system is that flies exhibit robust and quantitative taste behaviors that are readily amenable to analysis. The proboscis extension reflex (PER) is an attractive behavior to study the logic of taste processing in the fly brain because it involves a discrete and quantitative motor response that can be measured in individual animals (Dethier, 1976Dethier V.G. The Hungry Fly. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA1976Google Scholar). PER is elicited by the detection of palatable substances by sensory neurons on the legs or labella. This leads to the coordinated contraction of muscles that drive extension of the proboscis, followed by opening of the labella (Dethier, 1976Dethier V.G. The Hungry Fly. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA1976Google Scholar, Rajashekhar and Singh, 1994bRajashekhar K.P. Singh R.N. Organization of motor neurons innervating the proboscis musculature in Drosophila melanogaster meigen (Diptera: Drosophilidae).Int. J. Insect Morphol. Embryol. 1994; 23: 225-242Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). By contrast, detection of unpalatable substances sends inhibitory information to the SOG and can stimulate the contraction of muscles that drive proboscis retraction (Dethier, 1976Dethier V.G. The Hungry Fly. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA1976Google Scholar). The relative strength of palatable versus unpalatable tastes in a mixture will determine the probability that PER is initiated, illustrating that the fly brain integrates multiple sensory cues in making the choice of whether to extend (Dethier, 1976Dethier V.G. The Hungry Fly. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA1976Google Scholar, Meunier et al., 2003Meunier N. Marion-Poll F. Rospars J.P. Tanimura T. Peripheral coding of bitter taste in Drosophila.J.

Taste representations in the Drosophila brain.Cell. 2004; 117: 981-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the observation that motor neurons driving PER also make connections in the SOG has been used to suggest that taste circuits may exist locally in this structure (Rajashekhar and Singh, 1994bRajashekhar K.P. Singh R.N. Organization of motor neurons innervating the proboscis musculature in Drosophila melanogaster meigen (Diptera: Drosophilidae).Int. J. Insect Morphol. Embryol. 1994; 23: 225-242Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, Singh, 1997Singh R.N. Neurobiology of the gustatory systems of Drosophila and some terrestrial insects.Microsc. Res. Tech. 1997; 39: 547-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We conducted a behavioral screen to identify components of the PER circuit. We focus on a pair of motor neurons that is activated by sugar taste detection and inhibited by bitter compounds and is necessary and sufficient for a specific subprogram of PER. These neurons synapse on proboscis musculature and show broad dendritic fields in the SOG, but do not appear to make direct connections with GRNs. This study defines a group of molecularly identified taste-selective neurons in the fly brain and opens the door to pursuing more detailed circuit analysis in this system. To identify neurons involved in taste processing, we performed a genetic screen in which we silenced random neurons in the fly brain and examined the effect on taste behavior. To silence neural activity, an inward-rectifying potassium channel that prevents depolarization (Kir2.1; Baines et al., 2001Baines R.A. Uhler J.P. Thompson A. Sweeney S.T. Bate M. Altered electrical properties in Drosophila neurons developing without synaptic transmission.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the tetanus toxin light chain that prevents neurotransmitter release (TNT; Sweeney et al., 1995Sweeney S.T. Broadie K. Keane J. Niemann H. O'Kane C.J. Targeted expression of tetanus toxin light chain in Drosophila specifically eliminates synaptic transmission and causes behavioral defects.Neuron. 1995; 14: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) was expressed in small numbers of neurons in the adult fly brain using specific Gal4 enhancer trap lines. Toxin expression was inhibited during development by ubiquitous expression of temperature-sensitive Gal80 and then induced by transfer to 30°C 2 days prior to behavioral test (McGuire et al., 2004McGuire S.E. Mao Z. Davis R.L. Spatiotemporal gene expression targeting with the TARGET and gene-switch systems in Drosophila.Sci. STKE. 2004; 2004: pl6Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The proboscis extension reflex (PER) was used to test the flies' ability to respond to sweet and bitter compounds. This behavior is rapid, specific, and does not require general coordination. In addition, visually monitoring the behavior of single flies enables the identification of subtle behavioral defects. Flies were stimulated with 100 mM sucrose, 50 mM sucrose, and a mixture of 100 mM sucrose and 75 mM caffeine. Twenty-four trials with control flies established that the response frequencies to these stimuli were 96% ± 5%, 64% ± 9%, and 15% ± 13%, respectively (Figure 1A). Of 534 Gal4 enhancer trap lines selected based on their expression in the fly brain, 311 Gal4 enhancer trap lines were viable after toxin expression. For each Gal4 line, ten flies were tested with two trials for each taste compound. On average, these lines showed a response profile very similar to control flies (Figure 1A). To minimize false positives based on variation alone, we defined a behavioral mutant as one that had a response frequency greater than three standard deviations from the mean of control flies for one taste stimulus. Using this stringent cutoff, we identified 61 behavioral mutants in the primary screen, with 47 of the lines showing consistent behavioral defects in two retests. These lines were divided into classes based on the behavioral phenotype: those showing low response to 100 mM sucrose were classified as “unresponsive,” those with a decreased response to 50 mM sucrose were classified as “sugar mutants,” those with an increased response to the sucrose/caffeine mixture were classified as “bitter mutants,” and those that showed a qualitatively altered behavior were called “motor mutants” (Figure 1). In total, we identified eight unresponsive mutants, six sugar mutants, 27 bitter mutants, and six motor mutants (Table S1). The six motor mutants displayed very specific behavioral defects: three could not execute one or more of the specific movements required for proboscis extension, one could not retract the proboscis, one had difficulty ingesting liquid following proboscis extension, and one executed the behavior very slowly. To gain insight into the identity of neurons affecting PER behavior in each of the lines, we further classified each line based on its Gal4 expression pattern. Since silencing Gr66a- or Gr5a-expressing gustatory sensory neurons leads to bitter mutant and sugar mutant phenotypes, respectively (Figure 1A; Wang et al., 2004Wang Z. Singhvi A. Kong P. Scott K. Taste representations in the Drosophila brain.Cell. 2004; 117: 981-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), we expected some of the behavioral mutants' phenotypes to be caused by silencing of taste sensory neurons. Indeed, a subset of each behavioral class showed expression in taste sensory neurons (Figure 1B). Interestingly, all of the unresponsive mutants showed taste neuron expression, suggesting that the severe phenotypes of this class may be achievable only by eliminating taste sensory detection in the periphery. One of the six sugar mutants showed sensory neuron expression and displayed a phenotype similar to silencing of Gr5a-Gal4 neurons (Figure 1A). Eight of the 27 bitter mutant lines exhibited sensory expression, with behavioral phenotypes similar to silencing of Gr66a-Gal4 neurons (Figure 1A). The remaining mutants were roughly evenly divided between those with expression in SOG neurons and those without (Figure 1B). Those with SOG expression are good candidates for including bona fide taste circuit neurons, since this area of the brain receives taste input and is presumed to include neurons involved in taste processing. The lines showing expression restricted to outside the SOG likely include neurons whose activity is required to modulate taste circuit activity or higher-order taste circuit neurons involved in levels of taste processing outside the SOG. Although Gal4 expression patterns provide general information about candidate neurons that may participate in taste processing, the Gal4 lines label tens to thousands of neurons in the brain, only some of which are likely to participate in taste behaviors. The challenge ahead is to identify the specific neurons within each Gal4 line that contribute to behavior. We initially focused on one line, E49-Gal4, which displays a robust and specific motor defect, with the aim of isolating neurons causal for taste behaviors. PER involves several distinct and coordinated motions, including lifting of the rostrum from the head, extension of the haustellum, tilting of the head toward the food source, and spreading of the labellar lobes, followed by retraction of the proboscis back to resting state once the stimulus is removed (Chabaud et al., 2006Chabaud M.A. Devaud J.M. Pham-Delegue M.H. Preat T. Kaiser L. Olfactory conditioning of proboscis activity in Drosophila melanogaster.J. Comp. Physiol. A Neuroethol. Sens. Neural. Behav.

Neurobiology of the gustatory systems of Drosophila and some terrestrial insects.Microsc. Res. Tech. 1997; 39: 547-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar; Figure 2C and Movie S1). The coordinated contraction of 12 pairs of muscles is required to fully execute this behavior (Rajashekhar and Singh, 1994bRajashekhar K.P. Singh R.N. Organization of motor neurons innervating the proboscis musculature in Drosophila melanogaster meigen (Diptera: Drosophilidae).Int. J. Insect Morphol. Embryol. 1994; 23: 225-242Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). E49-Gal4, UAS-TNT flies display a specific defect in the proboscis extension reflex. They respond to stimulation with two concentrations of sucrose at a frequency comparable to wild-type, suggesting that they detect the sucrose stimulus normally (Figure 2B). However, the nature of the response is different between wild-type and E49-Gal4, UAS-TNT flies; E49-Gal4, UAS-TNT flies fail to execute the full motor program. Specifically, they do not lift the rostrum from the head, although other movements remain intact, including tilting the head toward the sugar stimulus and spreading the labella (Figure 2C and Movie S2). These results indicate that E49-Gal4 drives expression in neurons required for a subprogram of PER behavior and that silencing of these neurons allows continued execution of other independent subprograms. The neural silencing experiments argue that neurons marked by E49-Gal4 are necessary for proboscis extension. To determine whether activation of E49 neurons is sufficient to generate behavior, we used molecular genetic approaches to inducibly activate E49 neurons and examine the behavioral consequence. Channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) is a light-activated cation channel derived from the green alga Chlamydomonas renhardtii (Nagel et al., 2003Nagel G. Szellas T. Huhn W. Kateriya S. Adeishvili N. Berthold P. Ollig D. Hegemann P. Bamberg E. Channelrhodopsin-2, a directly light-gated cation-selective membrane channel.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 13940-13945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar). Expression of ChR2 causes neurons to rapidly depolarize in response to blue light (∼480 nm). ChR2 has been used effectively in C. elegans, Drosophila, and mammals to precisely activate neural subsets and generate behaviors (Arenkiel et al., 2007Arenkiel B.R. Peca J. Davison I.G. Feliciano C.

In control studies, flies expressing ChR2 in the sugar-sensing gustatory neurons display complete proboscis extension behavior to blue light, including head tilting, extension of the proboscis, and opening of the labella (Figure 2 and Movie S3), consistent with a recent study (Zhang et al., 2007bZhang W.

Neurosci. 2007; 26: 2405-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). By contrast, E49-Gal4, UAS-ChR2 flies respond to blue light by simply lifting the rostrum out of the head, causing the tip of the proboscis to point upward (Figure 2 and Movie S4). This behavioral subprogram is executed in the absence of the others that normally accompany it during PER: extension of the haustellum, opening of the labella, and tilting of the head forward. To confirm these results, we activated E49 neurons using a different exogenous, ligand-gated ion channel. VR1 is a mammalian cation channel from the TRP family that is gated by capsaicin, an ingredient in chili peppers, or temperatures above 45°C (Caterina et al., 1997Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D.

Imaging taste responses in the fly brain reveals a functional map of taste category and behavior.Neuron. 2006; 49: 285-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Thus, neurons ectopically expressing VR1 will depolarize when their temperature is transiently raised above 45°C. When a heated probe is brought in to close proximity of flies expressing VR1 in sugar-sensing gustatory neurons, these flies generate a complete proboscis extension behavior. Flies in which VR1 is expressed in E49 neurons, however, simply lift the rostrum of their proboscis in response to heat, in an isolated motion (Figure S1). Thus, the behavioral subprogram executed upon inducible activation of E49 neurons is precisely what was missing from PER when these neurons were silenced: lifting of the rostrum out of the head. This demonstrates that E49 neurons are both necessary and sufficient for this motor program. Furthermore, this program can be either executed or inhibited without affecting the other subprograms that are normally coordinated into one complete behavior. The adult fly brain contains ∼100,000 neurons, with different brain regions mediating different functions. Currently, little is known about the neural circuits controlling proboscis extension, except that gustatory sensory neurons (Singh, 1997Singh R.N.

Using a simplified slot machine task, we measured behavioral and neural responses to gambling outcomes. Compared to “full-misses,” near-misses were experienced as less pleasant, but increased desire to play. This effect was restricted to trials where the subject had personal control over arranging their gamble. Near-miss outcomes recruited striatal and insula circuitry that also responded to monetary wins; in addition, near-miss-related activity in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex varied as a function of personal control. Insula activity to near-misses correlated with self-report ratings as well as a questionnaire measure of gambling propensity. These data indicate that near-misses invigorate gambling through the anomalous recruitment of reward circuitry, despite the objective lack of monetary reinforcement on these trials."
https://openalex.org/W1992119552,"Although many proteins can misfold into a self-seeding amyloid-like conformation, only six are known to be infectious, that is prions. The prions [PSI(+)], [PIN(+)], [URE3], [SWI(+)] and [HET-s] cause distinct heritable physiological changes in fungi, whereas PrP(Sc) causes infectious encephalopathies in mammals. It is unknown whether 'protein-only' inheritance is limited to these exceptional cases or whether it represents a widespread mechanism of epigenetic control. Towards this goal, we now describe a new prion formed by the Cyc8 (Ssn6) protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Analogously to other yeast prions, transient overproduction of a glutamine-rich region of Cyc8 induced a heritable dominant cyc8(-) phenotype that is transmitted cytoplasmically and is dependent on the chaperone Hsp104 and the continued presence of the Cyc8 protein. The evolutionarily conserved Cyc8-Tup1 global transcriptional repressor complex forms one of the largest gene regulatory circuits, controlling the expression of more than 7% of yeast genes. Our finding that Cyc8 can propagate as a prion, together with a recent report that Swi1 of the Swi-Snf global transcriptional regulatory complex also has a prion form, shows that prionization can lead to mass activation or repression of yeast genes and is suggestive of a link between the epigenetic phenomena of chromatin remodelling and prion formation."

https://openalex.org/W2161849272,"Sleep is thought to consolidate changes in synaptic strength, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We investigated the cellular events involved in this process during ocular dominance plasticity (ODP)-a canonical form of in vivo cortical plasticity triggered by monocular deprivation (MD) and consolidated by sleep via undetermined, activity-dependent mechanisms. We find that sleep consolidates ODP primarily by strengthening cortical responses to nondeprived eye stimulation. Consolidation is inhibited by reversible, intracortical antagonism of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) or cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) during post-MD sleep. Consolidation is also associated with sleep-dependent increases in the activity of remodeling neurons and in the phosphorylation of proteins required for potentiation of glutamatergic synapses. These findings demonstrate that synaptic strengthening via NMDAR and PKA activity is a key step in sleep-dependent consolidation of ODP."

This study explored the neural correlates of this perceptual ability by measuring rapid changes of spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) in primary auditory cortex during detection of a target tone embedded in noise. Compared with responses in the passive state, STRF gain decreased during task performance in most cells. By contrast, STRF shape changes were excitatory and specific, and were strongest in cells with best frequencies near the target tone. The net effect of these adaptations was to accentuate the representation of the target tone relative to the noise by enhancing responses of near-target cells to the tone during high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) tasks while suppressing responses of far-from-target cells to the masking noise in low-SNR tasks. These adaptive STRF changes were largest in high-performance sessions, confirming a close correlation with behavior.

These adaptive STRF changes were largest in high-performance sessions, confirming a close correlation with behavior. Humans and animals commonly navigate noisy auditory scenes in which distracters abound and loud background sounds (acoustic maskers) obscure foreground (target) signals of interest. The mechanisms that give rise to the ability to discern and extract targeted auditory signals from noise are multifaceted, including simple adaptation to steady background noise, the perception of pitch that facilitates segregation of simultaneous speakers, and the localization and selective attention to one sound source among spatially distributed sound sources. One process that may underlie some of these abilities is real-time adaptive plasticity, in which the auditory system changes its filter properties in order to optimize its ability to discriminate foreground from background. We have previously described a form of rapid cortical plasticity in which the spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) in primary auditory cortex (A1) adapt during the task in a manner that maximizes the discrimination of the target (foreground) relative to reference (background) signals (Fritz et al., 2003Fritz J. Shamma S. Elhilali M. Klein D. Rapid task-related plasticity of spectrotemporal receptive fields in primary auditory cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1216-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Different aspects of this process have been recently explored in a series of experiments in which animals were trained to discriminate tones or tone-complexes from broadband noise, or discriminate between two tones of different frequencies (Fritz et al., 2005Fritz J.B. Elhilali M. Shamma S.A. Differential dynamic plasticity of A1 receptive fields during multiple spectral tasks.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7623-7635Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, Fritz et al., 2007bFritz J.B. Elhilali M. Shamma S.A. Adaptive changes in cortical receptive fields induced by attention to complex sounds.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 98: 2337-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In all these experiments, the pattern of STRF changes that emerged followed a simple model in which the acoustic features of the foreground were enhanced and those of the background suppressed, a hypothesis which we called a “contrast matched filter” (Fritz et al., 2007aFritz J.B. Elhilali M. David S.V. Shamma S.A. Does attention play a role in dynamic receptive field adaptation to changing acoustic salience in A1?.Hear. Res. 2007; 229: 186-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Such changes matched the signals' spectra so as to enhance the STRF responsiveness to the target relative to the reference. For instance, when a target tone is discriminated from a broadband noise reference, an excitatory region at the frequency of the tone emerges in the STRFs, surrounded by a region of suppression; but when the target tone is discriminated from a different reference tone (Fritz et al., 2005Fritz J.B. Elhilali M. Shamma S.A. Differential dynamic plasticity of A1 receptive fields during multiple spectral tasks.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7623-7635Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), the enhanced target excitation now becomes contrasted with suppression at the frequency of the reference tone. However, an important and currently unresolved question is whether the magnitude of these changes is influenced by task difficulty, or more specifically, by the perceptual difference between the target and reference signals that the animal must discriminate between. Furthermore, it is unknown how exactly the underlying receptive fields change under these circumstances, i.e., whether they simply exhibit a modulated gain, or alternatively, a change of shape such as via tuning or changing bandwidth. A handful of previous studies of visual processing have demonstrated that increased task difficulty generally enhances allocation of attention and the magnitude of its neural correlates in cortical responses (Boudreau et al., 2006Boudreau C.E. Williford T.H. Maunsell J.H. Effects of task difficulty and target likelihood in area V4 of macaque monkeys.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 96: 2377-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, Spitzer et al., 1988Spitzer H. Desimone R. Moran J.

Task difficulty: ignoring, attending to, and discriminating a visual stimulus yield progressively more activity in inferior temporal neurons.Exp. Brain Res. 1991; 83: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These measurements, however, did not distinguish receptive field gain from shape changes, and how increased task difficulty affected them differentially. We explored these issues using an auditory detection task in which a target tone was embedded in broadband noise of fixed amplitude, and task difficulty was modulated by varying the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the target. As target SNR decreased, distinguishing the target from the reference noise became more difficult, requiring more attention or effort, which, we predicted, could cause larger adaptive changes in the STRF. To explore this hypothesis, we trained ferrets to perform this task in a paradigm that was otherwise identical to one that used pure tone targets (Fritz et al., 2003Fritz J. Shamma S. Elhilali M. Klein D. Rapid task-related plasticity of spectrotemporal receptive fields in primary auditory cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1216-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In such a paradigm, the reference broadband noise was one of a set of 30 specially designed spectrotemporally modulated broadband noisy sounds—called temporally orthogonal ripple combinations (TORCs)—that were used to measure the STRF of the cell while the animal performed the task (Klein et al., 2000Klein D.J. Depireux D.A. Simon J.Z. Shamma S.A. Robust spectrotemporal reverse correlation for the auditory system: optimizing stimulus design.J. Comput. Neurosci. 2000; 9: 85-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The target tone here was simply embedded in the last of a sequence of TORCs, with a variable SNR that ranged from +15 to −10 dB. This approach allowed us to measure the full STRF of the cell rather than just its firing rates in response to a stimulus within its receptive field. Such a broad view enabled assessment of a variety of adaptive gain and tuning changes that might otherwise be difficult to detect. The key feature of the tone-in-noise task is that, unlike the case with pure-tone targets, the TORCs appeared not only as reference stimuli but also as maskers in the target stimulus, thus reducing the perceptual difference between target and reference signals. The animal presumably had to actively suppress the noise so as to enhance the detectability of the embedded target tone. We shall describe how rapid A1 plasticity in this task depended on three key factors: (1) task difficulty as reflected by the SNR of the target (i.e., high, medium, or low SNR); (2) cell's best frequency (BF) relative to the frequency of the target tone (i.e., near or far); and (3) attention level as reflected by task performance. Figure 1 illustrates the basic task, in which ferrets learned to lick a spout for liquid reward during a number (1–7) of reference sounds, but to refrain from licking during target sounds, using a conditioned avoidance paradigm (Fritz et al., 2003Fritz J. Shamma S. Elhilali M. Klein D. Rapid task-related plasticity of spectrotemporal receptive fields in primary auditory cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1216-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, Heffner and Heffner, 1995Heffner H.E. Heffner R.S. Condiotioned Avoidance.in: Klump G.M. Stebbins W. Methods in Comparative Psychoacoustics. Birkhäuser, Basel1995: 79-94Crossref Google Scholar). The top and bottom panels illustrate the spectra of the noise (TORC) reference and target tone stimuli, respectively, in high- and low-SNR conditions. The noise added to the target was randomly chosen from the set of 30 possible spectrotemporally modulated and broadband TORCs, delivered at the same level as the reference TORCs. The target tone SNR was then adjusted by varying the level of the embedded tone. As indicated, ferrets recognized and responded more quickly to high-SNR than to low-SNR targets. Figure 2A illustrates the typical average licking profile in one animal for a behavioral block of trials. The ferret consistently licked during the reference TORC stimuli (top panel), but decreased its licking when it recognized the target (bottom panel). This decrease in target licking occurred at different latencies and rates, reflecting the SNR of the target tone-in-noise. Thus, when the target tone was pure, the average lick rate dropped quickly after target recognition and approached zero in the poststimulus decision interval (1500–1800 ms) just prior to the shock interval (crosshatched interval of 1800–2200 ms). As the task became progressively more difficult at lower SNRs, lick rate decreased more gradually following target stimulus onset and crossed into the shock interval at rates that were inversely proportional to the detectability of the tone. Licking during the shock interval constituted an error response, and therefore, reflected the decrement in performance of the animal at low SNRs. In order to develop a quantitative behavioral index of task difficulty, we measured the average lick withdrawal time (LWT) of the animal, which we defined to be the time after target onset when the animal decreased its lick rate to half its average lick rate during the reference stimuli (i.e., down to 40% from 80% in Figure 2A). All three ferrets responded to pure tone targets quickly and suppressed licking with a minimum latency of ∼200 ms, as shown by the inflection point in the bottom panel of Figure 2A. For the pure-tone detection task, the LWT was 350 ms from the onset of the target tone. However, when TORCs were added to the target and SNR decreased, ferrets' LWT increased, as shown in Figure 2B, for all three animals tested. This trend resembles the increasing reaction time at lower SNRs seen in detection of tone-in-noise with human subjects (Kemp, 1984Kemp S. Reaction time to a tone in noise as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio and tone level.Percept. Psychophys. 1984; 36: 473-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that more attentional resources were devoted during difficult (low-SNR) tasks than those devoted during easy (high-SNR) tasks, we modified the task structure by randomly inserting probe trials (25%) of intermediate difficulty during a block of difficult or easy trials (75%). We reasoned that if detection levels of the rarer probes reflected the overall attentional level of the animal during the task that increased with task difficulty, then performance on the probe trials should be better during difficult tasks than during easy tasks (Boudreau et al., 2006Boudreau C.E. Williford T.H. Maunsell J.H. Effects of task difficulty and target likelihood in area V4 of macaque monkeys.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 96: 2377-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, Spitzer et al., 1988Spitzer H. Desimone R. Moran J. Increased attention enhances both behavioral and neuronal performance.Science. 1988; 240: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Behavioral experiments with four blocks of easy tasks (SNR = +10 dB) and four blocks of difficult tasks (SNR = −10 dB) tasks were carried out using intermediate probes of SNR = 0 dB. As predicted, probe discrimination rates differed considerably during easy and difficult tasks. Specifically, average discrimination rate during hard blocks was 52.6% compared with 69.2% for the probe trials, whereas during easy blocks, average discrimination rate was 72.9% during easy blocks compared with 58.6% on the probe trials. Thus, performance on the probe trials (for the same SNR level, intermediate probes) varied ∼10% depending on overall block difficulty or attentional load (from 58.6% to 69.2%). Neurophysiological recordings were conducted in A1 of two ferrets (#1 and #2 in Figure 2B) while they performed a tone detection task with target SNRs ranging from −9 to +15 dB. Patterns of receptive field plasticity (derived from a comparison of STRFs measured during the task condition to those measured during a passive sound presentation condition) were analyzed with respect to variations in two task parameters: (1) the frequency of the target tone relative to the BF of the recorded cells, and (2) task difficulty (i.e., target SNR). All STRF measurements were made from responses to the reference TORCs alone, not during any target presentations (as described in detail in Experimental Procedures and in Fritz et al., 2003Fritz J. Shamma S. Elhilali M. Klein D. Rapid task-related plasticity of spectrotemporal receptive fields in primary auditory cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1216-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Ferrets performed two or three tasks in a given recording session, but it was not always possible to maintain recordings from the same cell throughout multiple task conditions. Consequently, most of our STRF measurements are from single cells that were recorded during one task condition and also during its preceding passive state. In a given task, the target tone frequency and SNR were held constant throughout. Neurophysiological data were then pooled from all cells across different recording sessions. For analysis, we subdivided the data into near and far cells according to the separation between the each cell's BF (defined in Experimental Procedures) and the target tone frequency. Cells were labeled as near the target if the unit's BF was within 0.6 octaves from the target tone and as far otherwise. Apart from giving a roughly balanced population of each type (112 versus 125), the precise choice of this dividing line was arbitrary, and none of the results described below depended critically on its exact position (See Figure S4 in the Supplemental Data, available online). Therefore, units designated as near were primarily driven by the target tone, but also partly by the simultaneously presented component of noise in their local spectral vicinity. In contrast, far neurons could be viewed as primarily encoding the reference TORC and the masking noise in the target signal. Data were also subdivided into three groups according to the difficulty of the tasks, as parameterized by the target SNR. The three nonoverlapping ranges were: high SNR (≥0 dB), mid SNR (0 dB > SNR ≥ −5 dB), and low SNR (<−5 dB), with 93, 57, and 87 single units in each range, respectively. As in all our previous reports, all measured STRFs were normalized by their individual r.m.s. power (see Experimental Procedures). As a consequence, differences between the normalized STRFs reflected mostly changes in shape (as opposed to STRF gain). This issue is revisited later in this report where we explore a model that explicitly distinguishes between the gain and shape changes. When an animal discriminates a pure target tone from a TORC reference or from a tone of a different frequency, the induced STRF plasticity in A1 neurons usually consists of an enhancement at the frequency of the target tone and a weaker suppression that reflects the broad spectrum of the reference signal (Fritz et al., 2007bFritz J.B. Elhilali M. Shamma S.A. Adaptive changes in cortical receptive fields induced by attention to complex sounds.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 98: 2337-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the current experiments, the observed pattern of plasticity was roughly similar when the target tone level was high relative to the noise (SNR ≥ 0 dB) and the BF of the cell's STRF was near the target tone. An example of such STRF plasticity is shown in Figure 3A, when a target tone (4.8 kHz) with a relatively high SNR of 0 dB was placed near the BF of the cell (4.3 kHz). During behavior, the unit's STRF sharpened and its excitatory region strengthened relative to the inhibitory sideband. Afterward, the STRF largely reverted back to its prebehavior shape. This kind of facilitatory change at target frequency during behavior is typical of results of the pure-tone detection experiments reported previously (Fritz et al., 2003Fritz J. Shamma S. Elhilali M. Klein D. Rapid task-related plasticity of spectrotemporal receptive fields in primary auditory cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1216-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). However, in sharp contrast, when the tone was placed far from a unit's BF, the STRF change became suppressive in high-SNR tasks. For example, the target tone (2 kHz) in Figure 3B (high SNR of 4 dB) was placed more than 2 octaves below the unit's BF (9 kHz). The excitatory region of the unit's STRF (near 9 kHz) became substantially suppressed relative to its prebehavioral levels. As has often been observed in examples in previous plasticity studies (Fritz et al., 2003Fritz J. Shamma S. Elhilali M. Klein D. Rapid task-related plasticity of spectrotemporal receptive fields in primary auditory cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1216-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), this change persisted after behavior was completed. Although we frequently observed persistent changes, there was no systematic trend in persistence versus the type of STRF plasticity. This pattern of STRF changes is further illustrated by the sequence of two behavioral tasks shown in Figure 3C. Here the unit's prebehavioral STRF had two excitatory regions near 3 kHz and 5 kHz (the BF). When the high-SNR target was placed near the BF (4.9 kHz), the nearby region sharpened and became slightly enhanced during behavior, and then returned to its prebehavioral shape following the task. The task was then repeated but with a tone far from the BF (8 kHz). Consistent with the previous example, the excitatory region in the STRF was suppressed, a change that persisted afterwards. When the task was more difficult (low SNR), the plasticity pattern changed and STRFs on the whole became more depressed, especially far from the target. Three examples of such single-unit changes are depicted in Figure 4. In the first (Figure 4A), the target tone (3.2 kHz) was placed near the BF (4.7 kHz). During behavior, two changes were evident: the excitatory field was depressed and became more narrowly tuned around the BF, and a new inhibitory region appeared below the BF. Following behavior, the STRF partially recovered its broader excitatory field, which remained weak, however, relative to a strengthened postexcitatory inhibitory field. The example in Figure 4B illustrates the changes due to a low-SNR target tone placed far from the BF. Again, the STRF excitatory region weakened considerably during behavior, while the suppressive sideband below the BF strengthened. Note also the disappearance of inhibition above the BF near the frequency of the target tone (7 kHz) and the partial recovery of the original STRF after the behavior was completed. Figure 4C illustrates these same changes in a sequence of two low-SNR tasks in which the tone was placed at two distances: first relatively far from, and then near, the BF (6.3 kHz). As in the previous two examples, the STRF excitatory field was suppressed in both cases and then mostly recovered postbehavior. Suppression, however, was stronger in the far than in the near condition (second versus fourth panels). To obtain a global view of the receptive field plasticity in these tasks, and the factors that influenced the nature of this plasticity, we examined STRF changes in a population of 237 cells from two animals. We defined an “amplitude” change (ΔBF) in the STRF as the maximum difference between the “active” (during task) STRF and the “passive” (preceding the task) STRF measured within a spectrotemporal band ±0.2 octaves and 0–25 ms around the BF (as discussed in more detail in Experimental Procedures). As explained earlier, each STRF was normalized with respect to its r.m.s. power. The results of the population analysis were relatively independent of the exact choice of parameters and manipulations of this spectrotemporal window and normalization. STRFs exhibited different overall patterns of change depending on task difficulty (i.e., target SNR), as shown in Figure 3, Figure 4. In Figure 5, we compile and contrast such STRF changes from all units measured in the different tasks. In Figure 5A, histograms of the ΔBF changes were subdivided into high-, mid-, and low-SNR conditions. Overall, suppression was greater in lower-SNR tasks, as evidenced by the increasingly leftward skewed histograms. Suppression was weak in high- and mid-SNR tasks, and became significant (mean = −13.1%; p < 0.05) only in the low-SNR tasks. Using ANOVA we found that ΔBF changes for high- and low-SNR conditions were significantly different (p < 0.05). To present this trend in a more visually intuitive manner, we averaged the difference between active and passive STRFs (STRFdiff) of all units within each SNR group after aligning them at the locations of their ΔBFs, as shown in the three panels of Figure 5B. As anticipated from the ΔBF histograms in Figure 5A, suppression gradually increased from low to high task difficulty (i.e., from high to low SNR) as indicated by the progressively darker blue region at the origin of each subpanel in Figure 5B. (A) Histogram of STRF changes at BF (ΔBF) in all cells tested during high-, mid-, and low-SNR tasks showing progressively deeper suppression with an average ΔBF of −1.1%, −2.2%, and −13.1% in high-, mid-, and low-SNR tasks, respectively. (B) Average STRF differences (STRFdiff) between the active and passive states. Net suppression increased with increasing task difficulty (lower SNRs). Note that the time axis here is not the same as in Figure 3, Figure 4, but instead is normalized relative to when the ΔBF occurred in each cell. (C) STRF changes for each SNR divided into near and far groups. In all tasks, changes in the far cells were more suppressive than in near. Note that near cells showed an enhancement (positive ΔBF) in the high-SNR task, which weakened with increasing task difficulty. All plots are shown relative to the same color scale. The histograms and averages of Figures 5A and 5B include both near and far cells in each SNR condition. In Figure 5C we grouped the ΔBF changes according to target proximity in order to highlight the opposite effects that occur within each. Note that in the high-SNR tasks the net change across all cells was small and barely noticeable (Figure 5B, left panel). However, when we grouped the plasticity changes by near and far cells, it became apparent that near cells on average were enhanced (red) whereas far cells were suppressed (blue). This difference between near and far cells was also seen in the mid- and low-SNR groups, but this time relative to an overall progressively deeper (more blue) suppression. Figure S1 accumulates the data from all three SNR conditions to highlight the dependence of receptive field plasticity on the distance between the target tone and the BF of the STRF, regardless of task difficulty. Fluctuating performance levels in a given task may reflect changes in the attentional and/or motivational state of the animal. To explore how performance correlated with STRF changes, we ranked the performance level for all experiments (as defined by the discrimination rate for behavioral sessions in individual physiology experiments; see Experimental Procedures) and then computed the average difference between active and passive STRFs for the experiments with best (top third) behavioral performance. Figure 6 displays the results from a total of 85 cells in the tone-in-noise detection task, sorted into three groups by SNR level. All data were measured and presented exactly as in Figure 5, except in tasks with the best performance (see text). (A) Histogram of ΔBF changes in high-, mid-, and low-SNR tasks with average ΔBF of 14.3%, −2.5%, and −17.3% for high, mid, and low SNR, respectively. Changes in the high- and low-SNR cases are significant (p < 0.05). (B) Average STRFdiff between active and passive states. (C) STRF changes at each SNR divided into near and far groups. All plots are shown relative to the same color scale. All other details are as in Figure 5 panels. The trend of increasing suppression for low SNRs (e.g., as in Figure 5) is repeated here, but with an important difference: STRF changes were amplified. For example, in Figure 6B, the STRF change in high-SNR tasks exhibited a strong net (excitatory) enhancement compared with its weaker counterpart in Figure 5B. By contrast, low SNR tasks induced a deeper suppression than seen earlier in Figure 5B. ΔBF changes for high- and low-SNR conditions here were more distinctly different as demonstrated by the divergence in their means (p < 0.01). Therefore, the near and far cell populations within each of these three tasks (Figure 6C) displayed a divergence of enhancement and suppression similar to that of the entire neuronal population (Figure 5C), except that the changes were more pronounced. To demonstrate further the crucial role of behavior in inducing these changes, we measured STRF changes in 93 units from three naive animals using exactly the same stimuli and analysis procedures as those used in the behavioral animals. We observed some minor, but no consistent, changes in the STRFs in the absence of behavior, as illustrated in Figure S2. Our experimental technique and behavioral paradigm allowed us to measure the effect of STRF changes on the average peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) responses to the (reference) TORC stimuli since identical sets and sequences of TORCs were presented to all animals in all SNR tasks. Figure 7A contrasts the average TORC responses in the near and far cell populations (red and blue curves, respectively) during the two extreme tasks, the high- and low-SNR (left and right panels, respectively). This population of cells is the same group selected from sessions with best performance as shown in Figure 6. The normalized responses of these groups of cells during the passive epoch preceding the behavioral tasks are plotted in gray in each panel. Two obvious trends confirm earlier conclusions: (1) responses during behavior were more suppressed in far cells than in near cells, and (2) suppression strengthened with increasing task difficulty (lower SNRs). Thus, within a given level of task difficulty, far cells were more suppressed than near cells. Furthermore, increasing task difficulty from high- to low-SNR targets caused a uniform overall suppression of about one-third in the firing rate (as indicated by the dashed lines of Figure 7A). (A) Dependence of PSTH reference responses on task difficulty and BF separation from target tone. PSTH curves were computed from all cells selected for Figure 6 during the passive state (faint gray curves), and during the high-SNR and low-SNR tasks (left and right panels, respectively). In each panel, responses of near (red) and far (blue) cells are shown. All responses were normalized relative to their corresponding passive responses (after subtracting out the spontaneous activity). In general, far cells were more suppressed relative to the near cells. For both near and far cells, increasing task difficulty (from high to low SNR) caused comparable suppression of about 30%. (B) Distribution of STRF gain changes during behavior relative to the prebehavioral state. These distributions depended weakly on task conditions and target distance from BF as shown in bottom and right panels. Specifically, these pure gain changes resulted in increased suppression of far STRFs (bottom panels) and of STRFs during low-SNR rela"

Among ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPA, kainate, NMDA), AMPA receptors mediate fast synaptic transmission and require TARP auxiliary subunits. NMDA receptors and kainate receptors play roles in synaptic transmission, but it remains uncertain whether these ionotropic glutamate receptors also have essential subunits. Using a proteomic screen, we have identified NETO2, a brain-specific protein of unknown function, as an interactor with kainate-type glutamate receptors. NETO2 modulates the channel properties of recombinant and native kainate receptors without affecting trafficking of the receptors and also modulates kainate-receptor-mediated mEPSCs. Furthermore, we found that kainate receptors regulate the surface expression of NETO2 and that NETO2 protein levels and surface expression are decreased in mice lacking the kainate receptor GluR6. The results show that NETO2 is a kainate receptor subunit with significant effects on glutamate signaling mechanisms in brain.

The results show that NETO2 is a kainate receptor subunit with significant effects on glutamate signaling mechanisms in brain. Excitatory synaptic transmission in brain is primarily mediated by the neurotransmitter glutamate. Glutamate released from presynaptic terminals binds to three classes of ionotropic glutamate receptors, which are pharmacologically classified as AMPA- (amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid), NMDA- (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid), and kainate-sensitive glutamate receptors (Dingledine et al., 1999Dingledine R.

AMPA receptors mediate fast synaptic transmission, whereas NMDA receptors are involved in synaptic plasticity. Kainate receptors play multiple roles in synaptic transmission. Postsynaptic kainate receptors mediate slow EPSCs (Castillo et al., 1997Castillo P.E. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A.

Although mice in which kainate receptor expression is genetically disrupted show no kainate receptor activity, overexpression of kainate receptors does not enhance kainate-receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), suggesting that native kainate receptors may contain additional modulatory proteins. For example, faithful reconstitution of native AMPA receptor properties in heterologous cells requires coexpression of transmembrane AMPA receptor auxiliary subunits (TARPs) (Nicoll et al., 2006Nicoll R.A.

The primary effect of these proteins is to modulate receptor localization. Garcia et al., 1998Garcia E.P. Mehta S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garner C.C. Marshall J.

However, subsequent studies at greater time resolutions using outside-out patch membranes showed that SAP90/PSD95 does not modulate the rate at which receptors desensitize, but rather accelerates recovery from desensitization (Bowie et al., 2003Bowie D. Garcia E.P. Marshall J. Traynelis S.F. Lange G.D. Allosteric regulation and spatial distribution of kainate receptors bound to ancillary proteins.J. Physiol. 2003; 547: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recently, KRIP6 was also shown to modulate receptor kinetics. KRIP6 enhanced the ratio of steady-state to peak currents, but did not significantly alter decay kinetics in heterologous cells (Laezza et al., 2007Laezza F. Wilding T.J. Sequeira S. Coussen F. Zhang X.Z. Hill-Robinson R. Mulle C. Huettner J.E. Craig A.M. KRIP6: a novel BTB/kelch protein regulating function of kainate receptors.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2007; 34: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Importantly, enhancement of kainate-receptor-mediated EPSCs by overexpression of these interactors has not yet been shown. In this study, we identified a brain-specific transmembrane protein of unknown function, NETO2, using a proteomic screen. NETO2 slows the decay kinetics of kainate receptors in heterologous cells without affecting receptor expression at the cell surface. Single-channel analysis showed that NETO2 also increases the open probability (Popen) of kainate-receptor channels, resulting in significantly larger peak glutamate-evoked currents. NETO2 modulated the agonist sensitivity of kainate receptors in heterologous cells and neurons. Importantly, NETO2 slowed the decay of kainate-receptor-mediated EPSCs, demonstrating that it directly influences synaptic transmission. The total amount of NETO2 is decreased in mice lacking the kainate receptor subunit GluR6, and kainate receptors increase the surface expression of NETO2 in both heterologous cells and neurons. The results indicate that NETO2 is an accessory subunit of neuronal kainate receptors that has important effects on receptor function. The kainate receptor subunit GluR6 plays major roles in kainate receptor function (Mulle et al., 1998Mulle C. Sailer A. Perez-Otano I. Dickinson-Anson H. Castillo P.E. Bureau I. Maron C. Gage F.H. Mann J.R. Bettler B. Heinemann S.F. Altered synaptic physiology and reduced susceptibility to kainate-induced seizures in GluR6-deficient mice.Nature. 1998; 392: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) and is highly expressed in cerebellum (Bahn et al., 1994Bahn S. Volk B. Wisden W. Kainate receptor gene expression in the developing rat brain.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5525-5547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Smith et al., 1999Smith T.C. Wang L.Y. Howe J.R. Distinct kainate receptor phenotypes in immature and mature mouse cerebellar granule cells.J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that interact with kainate receptors, we used rat cerebella for coimmunoprecipitation experiments with anti GluR6/7 antibody, followed by silver staining. Mass spectrometry analysis of bands immunoprecipitated with anti GluR6/7 antibody identified a rat ortholog of NETO2/Btcl2 (99% shared identity of amino acids), a brain-specific mouse protein of unknown function (Michishita et al., 2004Michishita M.

A novel gene encoding a putative transmembrane protein with two extracellular CUB domains and a low-density lipoprotein class A module: isolation of alternatively spliced isoforms in retina and brain.Gene. 2002; 286: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), as well as AKAP8, the kainate receptor subunits GluR6 and GluR7, and a major contaminant, keratin (Figure 1A and Table S1 available online). NETO2 and GluR6/7 were also coimmunoprecipitated with an anti GluR5 antibody that also recognizes GluR6 directly (Figure S1A available online), whereas AKAP8 was not detected (Figure S1B), suggesting that the anti GluR6/7 antibody may directly recognize AKAP8. To test this possibility, we used Cos-7 cells transfected with FLAG-AKAP8 for immunoprecipitation experiments with anti GluR6/7 antibody. We found that AKAP8 was weakly immunoprecipitated with anti GluR6/7 antibody in the absence of GluR6/7 expression (Figure S1C). We therefore concluded that NETO2, but not AKAP8, is a kainate receptor interactor. To determine if NETO2 interacted specifically with kainate receptors, we generated antibodies against the cytoplasmic domain of NETO2. NETO2 is a 525 amino acid protein that contains a signal peptide, and the expected molecular weight of NETO2 protein after cleavage of the signal peptide is 56 kDa. Anti NETO2 antibody recognized 58–60 kDa bands in NETO2 transfected CHO cells, but not untransfected cells, and similar bands were recognized in lysates from rat brain and mouse cerebellar granule cell cultures (Figure S2). Thus, we concluded that the anti NETO2 antibody recognized NETO2 in brain and transfected cells. We used anti NETO2 antibody for coimmunoprecipitation experiments on rat cerebellar lysates. We found that NETO2 interacts specifically with kainate receptors, but not with AMPA and NMDA receptors (Figure 1B). In contrast, TARPs interact specifically with AMPA receptors, but not with kainate and NMDA receptors (Figure 1B). NETO2 codistributed with the kainate receptor subunits GluR6/7 and KA2, and was highly enriched in the postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction, along with PSD95 and the NMDA receptor subunit NR1 (Figure 1C). Sequence analysis indicates that NETO2 contains one transmembrane domain, as well as two CUB domains and one LDLa domain that are extracellular. Like the NMDA receptor subunit NR1, NETO2 contains EndoH sensitive sugars (2–3 kDa), consistent with the idea that NETO2 is a transmembrane protein (Figure 1D). The predicted structure of NETO2 is substantially different from that of the TARP family of AMPA receptor auxiliary subunits (Figure 1E). Here NETO2 is identified as a CUB-domain-containing protein that binds to ion channels in the vertebrate. In Caenorhabditis elegans, CUB-domain-containing proteins LEV-10 and SOL-1 were identified as modulators of acetylcholine receptors and GLR-1 AMPA receptors (Gally et al., 2004Gally C. Eimer S.

A transmembrane protein required for acetylcholine receptor clustering in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 2004; 431: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, Zheng et al., 2004Zheng Y. Mellem J.E. Brockie P.J. Madsen D.M. Maricq A.V.

Brockie P.J. Mellem J.E. Madsen D.M. Walker C.S. Francis M.M. Maricq A.V. SOL-1 is an auxiliary subunit that modulates the gating of GLR-1 glutamate receptors in Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 1100-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the domain structure of NETO2 is more similar to the domain structure of invertebrate proteins that modulate acetylcholine receptors (LEV-10) than SOL-1, which modulates GLR-1 AMPA receptors (Figure S3). In addition, NETO2 is similar to the hypothetical proteins Q9XUU2 in C. elegans and Q9VYC7 in Drosophila melanogaster (Figure S3 and Discussion). To begin to explore the functional role of NETO2 interactions with kainate receptors, we coexpressed these proteins in Xenopus laevis oocytes, in which protein expression could be more tightly regulated by complementary RNA (cRNA) injection (in comparison with transfection of cDNAs in mammalian cells). The detection of glutamate-evoked currents in oocytes injected with 0.5 ng GluR6 cRNA by two-electrode voltage-clamp recording (TEVC) required reduction of desensitization with concanavalin A (Wong and Mayer, 1993Wong L.A. Mayer M.L. Differential modulation by cyclothiazide and concanavalin A of desensitization at native alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid- and kainate-preferring glutamate receptors.Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 504-510PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, large glutamate-evoked currents were routinely recorded without concanavalin A treatment in oocytes coinjected with 0.5 ng NETO2 cRNA and 0.5 ng GluR6 cRNA, whereas coexpression of NETO2 had no effect on the activity of AMPA receptors or stargazin-like TARP/AMPA receptor complexes expressed at the minimum levels to detect further enhancement (Figures 2A, 2B, and S4). To determine whether the NETO2-associated increase in GluR6 currents was due to an increase in receptor expression at the cell surface, we measured in parallel glutamate-evoked currents by TEVC and the surface expression of kainate receptors by chemiluminescence. Oocytes were injected with extracellular HA-epitope-tagged GluR6 at nonsaturating amounts (0.5 ng) of HA-GluR6 cRNA (Figure S5) with varying amounts of NETO2 cRNA (Tomita et al., 2005Tomita S. Adesnik H. Sekiguchi M. Zhang W. Wada K. Howe J.R. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Stargazin modulates AMPA receptor gating and trafficking by distinct domains.Nature. 2005; 435: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). We found that NETO2 enhanced maximal glutamate-evoked currents in a dose-dependent manner, but had no effect on surface expression (Figure 2C and the raw data in Figure S6), suggesting that NETO2 enhances GluR6 currents by modulating the functional properties of the receptors, perhaps by slowing desensitization. To examine NETO2 modulation of receptor properties at a better time resolution, we expressed NETO2 and GluR6 in tsA201 cells and applied glutamate to outside-out patches from the transfected cells with a fast piezoelectric system. Coexpression of GluR6 and NETO2 at a cDNA ratio of 1:10 resulted in significant slowing of both desensitization and deactivation (Figures 3A–3C). Relative to the corresponding values for GluR6 alone, the NETO2-associated increase in mean weighted tau values was 500% for desensitization and 64% for deactivation. The results obtained with cDNA ratios of 1:10 and 1:30 were similar, indicating that most GluR6 receptors in the patches studied contained NETO2. In addition, NETO2 did not modulate desensitization of GluR1 AMPA receptors (time constant of desensitization: GluR1 alone, 2.4 ± 0.2 ms, n = 5; GluR1 + NETO2, 2.2 ± 0.5 ms, n = 4). Two-pulse protocols showed that NETO2 also causes GluR6 receptors to recover faster from desensitization, especially at short interpulse intervals (Figure 3D). Together, the slower entry into desensitization and faster recovery seen with NETO2 coexpression resulted in a 9-fold enhancement of steady-state currents (0.11 ± 0.02% versus 1.01% ± 0.24% of the peak current, n = 6 and 9, respectively). Notably, the difference in kinetics suggests that there is no endogenous NETO2 in tsA201 cells, because human and rat NETO2 should have similar effects on receptor kinetics given the high degree of identity (97%) the two proteins share. To determine the effect of NETO2 on unitary receptor properties, we made concentration jumps on patches containing only a few channels (Figure 3E). As reported before (Swanson et al., 1996Swanson G.T. Feldmeyer D. Kaneda M. Cull-Candy S.G. Effect of RNA editing and subunit co-assembly single-channel properties of recombinant kainate receptors.J. Physiol. 1996; 492: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), GluR6-Q channels displayed three open levels with conductances of approximately 7, 17, and 26 pS. NETO2 coexpression had no effect on unitary conductance and did not alter the relative frequency or the mean duration of openings to each conductance level (Table 1). However, the duration of bursts of openings (tcrit = 4 ms) was clearly longer with NETO2 (Figures 3E and 3F) and the mean duration of these bursts was increased significantly (Table 1).Table 1Effect of NETO2 on the Unitary Properties of GluR6-Q ChannelsGluR6-QGluR6-Q + NETO2Conductance (pS)O17.4 ± 0.3 (24.7%)7.4 ± 0.2 (18.2%)O216.9 ± 0.4 (43.2%)16.4 ± 0.5 (51.3%)O327.0 ± 0.8 (32.1%)25.5 ± 0.6 (30.5%)Open time (ms)O10.87 ± 0.130.70 ± 0.05O20.60 ± 0.090.80 ± 0.07O30.81 ± 0.140.89 ± 0.07Burst length (ms)0.64 ± 0.080.66 ± 0.104.60 ± 0.387.45 ± 0.82∗Mean ± SEM values from four or five patches are listed.

In patches in which the maximum number of receptors that open simultaneously was estimated to be three or four, the number of jumps that produced no detectable openings (“failures”) was much higher in the absence of NETO2 coexpression (Figure 3E). Our measurements of the relative frequency of openings to each conductance level with and without NETO2 (Table 1) were used to calculate the mean single-channel current, which together with the number of active receptors in the patch allowed us to estimate the Popen at the peak of the ensemble current (peak Popen). NETO2 coexpression increased peak Popen significantly (Figure 3G). In total, the results show that the inclusion of NETO2 in kainate receptor assemblies modulates both the amplitude and kinetics of ensemble currents evoked by rapid pulses of glutamate, leading to a marked increase in charge transfer. Our results suggest that the mechanism underlying NETO2-mediated kainate receptor modulation differs from TARP modulation of AMPA receptors. TARPs slow both the deactivation and desensitization of AMPA receptors to similar extents, suggesting that they decrease the activation energy for channel opening, whereas NETO2 has larger effects on desensitization and may primarily alter the rate constants governing transits in and out of desensitized states (Figure 3H). We next examined whether NETO2 modulates the properties of the synaptic receptors that mediate kainate-receptor miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). We used cerebellar granule cells for these studies because their small size allowed us to measure EPSC kinetics accurately. To minimize the contribution of AMPA receptors, we used neurons from stargazer mice, which lack AMPA-receptor-mediated EPSCs (Chen et al., 2000Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T.

NMDA receptors, GABA receptors, and voltage-gated sodium channels were blocked by the inclusion of AP-5, picrotoxin, and tetrodotoxin (respectively) in the external solution. We did not detect mEPSCs in stargazer granule cells, even after transfecting the neurons with GluR6, although we routinely detected AMPA receptor mEPSCs in neurons in parallel cultures transfected with stargazin. We hypothesized that the low peak Popen of GluR6 channels limited our detection of kainate receptors at synapses. We therefore transfected granule cells with a GluR6 mutant in which substitution of lysine for arginine at position 696 reduces receptor desensitization (Priel et al., 2006Priel A. Selak S. Lerma J.

In oocytes injected with cRNAs, NETO2 enhanced glutamate-evoked currents of GluR6 (K696R) receptors without altering surface expression of the receptors (Figure S7). We did observe mEPSCs in some neurons transfected with GluR6 (K696R) alone, although the frequency of the events was very low (Figure 4A). In contrast, mEPSCs were observed in most neurons cotransfected with NETO2 and GluR6 (K696R), and the frequency of these events was significantly greater (Figure 4A). Examples of representative mEPSCs are shown in Figures 4B and 4C. The mEPSCs detected in each type of transfected neuron were mediated by kainate receptors, as confirmed by their resistance to block by selective AMPA receptor antagonists (50 μM GYKI 53655 and 100 μM SYM 2206) (Figures 4B and 4C). The decay kinetics of the kainate-receptor-mediated mEPSCs with and without NETO2 coexpression were different and were slower in neurons cotransfected with NETO2 (Figure 4D), and NETO2 significantly increased the half-width of individual mEPSCs, as well as the decay time and charge transfer of ensemble averages from individual neurons (Figure 4E). Additionally, in cerebellar granule cells from stargazer mice, NETO2 slowed the decay of spontaneous kainate-receptor EPSCs in neurons transfected with GluR5. The time constants obtained from fitting average EPSCs were 0.87 ± 0.10 ms for neurons transfected with GluR5 alone and 2.6 ± 0.36 ms for neurons cotransfected with GluR5 and NETO2 (p < 0.05). The results indicate that NETO2 can modulate kainate-receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. It is well known that kainate-receptor-mediated EPSCs are less than 10% of the amplitude of AMPA-receptor-mediated EPSCs (Castillo et al., 1997Castillo P.E. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A.

Detailed dissection of single-vesicle recycling still remains a major challenge. We have developed a fluorescent pH reporter that permits us to follow the fate of individual vesicles at hippocampal synapses after exocytosis. Here we show that, during low-frequency stimulation, single-vesicle fusion leads to two distinct vesicle internalizations, instead of one, as in general perception: one by a fast endocytosis pathway (∼3 s), the other by a slow endocytosis pathway (after 10 s). The exocytosed vesicular proteins are preferentially recaptured in both pathways. RNAi knockdown of clathrin inhibits both pathways. As stimulation frequency increases, the number of endocytosed vesicles begins to match antecedent exocytosis. Meanwhile, the slow endocytosis is accelerated and becomes the predominant pathway. These results reveal that two pathways of endocytosis are orchestrated during neuronal activity, establishing a highly efficient endocytosis at central synapses."

Here, we have tested the hypothesis that specific cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoforms of the PDE4D family that are expressed in the heart are also part of the I(Ks) signaling complex and contribute to its regulation by cAMP. PDE4D isoforms co-immunoprecipitated with I(Ks) channels in hearts of mice expressing the I(Ks) channel. In myocytes isolated from these mice, I(Ks) was increased by pharmacological PDE inhibition. PDE4D3, but not PDE4D5, co-immunoprecipitated with the I(Ks) channel only in Chinese hamster ovary cells co-expressing AKAP-9, and PDE4D3, but not PDE4D5, co-immunoprecipitated with AKAP-9. Functional experiments in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing AKAP-9 and either PDE4D3 or PDE4D5 isoforms revealed modulation of the I(Ks) response to cAMP by PDE4D3 but not PDE4D5.

Dietary ATX is important for development and survival of salmonids and crustaceans and has been shown to reduce cardiac ischemic injury in rodents. The purpose of this study was to examine whether ATX can protect against ischemic injury in the mammalian brain. Adult rats were injected intracerebroventricularly with ATX or vehicle prior to a 60-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). ATX was present in the infarction area at 70-75 min after onset of MCAo. Treatment with ATX, compared to vehicle, increased locomotor activity in stroke rats and reduced cerebral infarction at 2 d after MCAo. To evaluate the protective mechanisms of ATX against stroke, brain tissues were assayed for free radical damage, apoptosis, and excitoxicity. ATX antagonized ischemia-mediated loss of aconitase activity and reduced glutamate release, lipid peroxidation, translocation of cytochrome c, and TUNEL labeling in the ischemic cortex. ATX did not alter physiological parameters, such as body temperature, brain temperature, cerebral blood flow, blood gases, blood pressure, and pH. Collectively, our data suggest that ATX can reduce ischemia-related injury in brain tissue through the inhibition of oxidative stress, reduction of glutamate release, and antiapoptosis. ATX may be clinically useful for patients vulnerable or prone to ischemic events."

The set-up provides a high bioluminescent signal and should be useful for studying in vivo T cell function in mouse models of disease investigating mouse or human primary T cells. We developed a new approach to bioluminescent T cell imaging using a membrane-anchored form of the Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) enzyme, termed extGLuc, which we could stably express in both mouse and human primary T cells. In vitro, extGLuc+ cells emitted significantly higher bioluminescent signal when compared to cells expressing GLuc, Renilla luciferase (RLuc) or membrane-anchored RLuc (extRLuc). In vivo, mouse extGLuc+ T cells showed higher bioluminescent signal when compared to GLuc+ and RLuc+ T cells. Application of this imaging approach to human T cells genetically modified to express tumor-specific chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) enabled us to show in vivo CAR-mediated T cell accumulation in tumor, T cell persistence over time and concomitant imaging of T cells and tumor cells modified to express firefly luciferase. This sensitive imaging technology has application to many in vivo cell-based studies in a wide array of mouse models."
https://openalex.org/W2037115363,"Prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthases (PGHSs) 1 and 2, also known as cyclooxygenases (COXs), catalyze the oxygenation of arachidonic acid (AA) in the committed step in prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis. PGHSs are homodimers that display half of sites COX activity with AA; thus, PGHSs function as conformational heterodimers. Here we show that, during catalysis, fatty acids (FAs) are bound at both COX sites of a PGHS-2 dimer. Initially, an FA binds with high affinity to one COX site of an unoccupied homodimer. This monomer becomes an allosteric monomer, and it causes the partner monomer to become the catalytic monomer that oxygenates AA. A variety of FAs can bind with high affinity to the COX site of the monomer that becomes the allosteric monomer. Importantly, the efficiency of AA oxygenation is determined by the nature of the FA bound to the allosteric monomer. When tested with low concentrations of saturated and monounsaturated FAs (<i>e.g.</i> oleic acid), the rates of AA oxygenation are typically 1.5-2 times higher with PGHS-2 than with PGHS-1. These different kinetic behaviors of PGHSs may account for the ability of PGHS-2 but not PGHS-1 to efficiently oxygenate AA in intact cells when AA is a small fraction of the FA pool such as during ""late phase"" PG synthesis."

We demonstrate that expression of four such subunits A1, B1, E2 and a4 all co-localize with the forkhead transcription factor Foxi1 in a subset of epithelial cells at these three locations. In cells, of such epithelia, that lack Foxi1 we fail to identify any expression of A1, B1, E2 and a4 demonstrating an important role for the transcription factor Foxi1 in regulating subunit availability. Promoter reporter experiments, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and site directed mutagenesis demonstrate that a Foxi1 expression vector can trans-activate an a4-promoter reporter construct in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays that Foxi1-dependent activation to a large extent depends on cis-elements at position −561/−547 in the a4 promoter. Thus, we provide evidence that Foxi1 is necessary for expression of at least four subunits in three different epithelia and most likely is a major determinant for proper assembly of a functional vacuolar H+-ATPase complex at these locations."
https://openalex.org/W2041812600,"Smad proteins transduce the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signal at the cell surface into gene regulation in the nucleus. Upon TGF-β treatment, the highly homologous Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated by the TGF-β receptor at the SSXS motif in the C-terminal tail. Here we show that in addition to the C-tail, three (S/T)-P sites in the Smad3 linker region, Ser208, Ser204, and Thr179 are phosphorylated in response to TGF-β. The linker phosphorylation peaks at 1 h after TGF-β treatment, behind the peak of the C-tail phosphorylation. We provide evidence suggesting that the C-tail phosphorylation by the TGF-β receptor is necessary for the TGF-β-induced linker phosphorylation. Although the TGF-β receptor is necessary for the linker phosphorylation, the receptor itself does not phosphorylate these sites. We further show that ERK is not responsible for TGF-β-dependent phosphorylation of these three sites. We show that GSK3 accounts for TGF-β-inducible Ser204 phosphorylation. Flavopiridol, a pan-CDK inhibitor, abolishes TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Thr179 and Ser208, suggesting that the CDK family is responsible for phosphorylation of Thr179 and Ser208 in response to TGF-β. Mutation of the linker phosphorylation sites to nonphosphorylatable residues increases the ability of Smad3 to activate a TGF-β/Smad-target gene as well as the growth-inhibitory function of Smad3. Thus, these observations suggest that TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Smad3 linker sites inhibits its antiproliferative activity."
https://openalex.org/W2033294541,"Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is central to synaptic transmission.

The interaction of CaMKIIα with D3Rs transforms D3Rs into a biochemical substrate of the kinase and promotes the kinase to phosphorylate D3Rs at a selective serine site (S229).

By binding and phosphorylating limbic D3Rs, CaMKIIα modulates dopamine signaling and psychomotor function in an activity-dependent manner. Dopamine is a major neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. This transmitter exerts its pleiotropic actions through interactions with two classes of dopamine receptors: the D1 class (D1 and D5 subtypes) and the D2 class (D2, D3, and D4 subtypes). The former is coupled to Gαs-proteins, whereas the latter is generally coupled to Gαi/o-proteins. Through Gαi/o-proteins, the D2 class of receptors inhibits adenylyl cyclase and the downstream formation of cAMP (Neve et al., 2004Neve K.A. Seamans J.K. Trantham-Davidson H. Dopamine receptor signaling.J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 2004; 24: 165-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Remarkably, among all dopamine receptor subtypes, the dopamine D3 receptor (D3R), one of the lesser-investigated subtypes, shows a unique distribution pattern in the forebrain. D3Rs are preferentially expressed in the mesolimbic dopaminergic projection areas, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) (Sokoloff et al., 1990Sokoloff P. Giros B. Martres M.P. Bouthenet M.L.

This specific localization of D3Rs suggests a significant role of the receptor in the control of reward, motivation, cognition, emotion, and extrapyramidal motor functions. Moreover, malfunction of D3Rs has been frequently associated with the pathogenesis of various mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, depression, and substance addiction (reviewed in Heidbreder et al., 2005Heidbreder C.A.

Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is an enzyme that is abundant in brain cells, especially at synaptic sites (Kelly et al., 1984Kelly P.T. McGuinness T.L. Greengard P.

USA. 1984; 81: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The enzyme is removed from its autoinhibitory state and activated by the binding of Ca2+ and calmodulin (CaM). Activated CaMKII accesses and phosphorylates not only exogenous substrates but also its own autophosphorylation site (T286 in the α isoform) within the autoregulatory domain. The autophosphorylation renders a Ca2+/CaM-independent (autonomous) kinase activity even after the initial Ca2+ stimulus subsides (Hudmon and Schulman, 2002Hudmon A. Schulman H.

As such, CaMKII integrates and prolongs the information conveyed by diverse forms of Ca2+ transients and serves as a dynamic regulator that decodes activity-dependent Ca2+ signals into various forms of synaptic activity and plasticity (reviewed in Hudmon and Schulman, 2002Hudmon A.

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and synaptic plasticity.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The multifunctional nature of CaMKII also stems from its interactions with various binding partners in defined subcellular regions (Colbran, 2004Colbran R.J. Targeting of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Through direct protein-protein interactions, CaMKII vigorously regulates expression and function of interacting partners and vice versa. In searching for new targets of CaMKII at synaptic sites, we identify the limbic D3R as a direct substrate of CaMKII. We show that CaMKIIα interacts directly with the N-terminal region of the third intracellular loop of D3Rs in a Ca2+- and autophosphorylation-sensitive manner in vitro. This interaction allows CaMKII to phosphorylate D3Rs at a selective serine residue. In accumbal neurons in vivo, Ca2+ stimulates the association of CaMKII with D3Rs and increases serine phosphorylation of D3Rs, resulting in suppression of D3R function. The CaMKII-mediated inhibition of D3Rs plays a significant role in regulating behavioral responsiveness to cocaine. Collectively, our results demonstrate a new synaptic model for the activity-dependent regulation of limbic D3Rs by CaMKII. D3Rs contain a large third intracellular domain that is a main site for protein-protein interactions (Figure S1 available online). To search for new proteins that bind to this domain, we prepared glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins containing the second or third intracellular loop of rat D3Rs, D3RIL2 or D3RIL3 (Figure 1A), and used them as immobilized (GST-bound) baits to screen NAc lysates in pull-down assays. We found a protein (∼50 kDa) that was specifically precipitated by GST-D3RIL3, but not by GST alone (Figure 1B) or GST-D3RIL2 (data not shown). This protein was subsequently identified as CaMKIIα by mass spectrometry. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that GST-D3RIL3, but not GST-D3RIL2 or GST alone, precipitated CaMKIIα (Figure 1C). Neither the GST-fusion proteins nor GST precipitated CaMKIV, another isoform of CaMK (Figure 1C). This indicates the selectivity of D3Rs in the interaction with CaMKII. To identify the specific CaMKIIα region responsible for the interaction with D3Rs, GST-fusion proteins were prepared from three major structures of CaMKIIα: the N-terminal catalytic domain (GST-CaMKIIαCD), the regulatory domain (GST-CaMKIIαRD), and the C-terminal association domain (GST-CaMKIIαAD) (Figure 1D). We found that GST-CaMKIIαCD precipitated D3Rs in accumbal lysates, whereas GST-CaMKIIαRD, GST-CaMKIIαAD, and GST-CaMKIV did not (Figure 1E). None of the GST-fusion proteins precipitated dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs) (Figure 1F). Thus, the primary CaMKIIα region for the interaction with D3Rs is restricted to CaMKIIαCD. All blots were probed in parallel with a GST antibody to ensure equivalent protein loading (data not shown). To define whether the CaMKIIα-D3R interaction is direct, and to reveal the accurate region of D3RIL3 involved in the interaction, we conducted in vitro binding assays with purified proteins (Figure 1G–1J). We found that CaMKIIα bound to immobilized GST-D3RIL3 and GST-D3RIL3(R210-P239), but not to other GST-D3RIL3 fragments (Figure 1H). No CaMKIIα bound to GST-D2RIL3(I210-V270) (Figure 1I). In the reverse experiment, D3RIL3 bound to immobilized GST-CaMKIIα and GST-CaMKIIαCD, but not to GST-CaMKIIαRD, GST-CaMKIIαAD, or GST-CaMKIV (Figure 1J). These results demonstrate that CaMKIIα directly binds to D3Rs in vitro. The R210-P239 fragment, a 30 amino acid region at the N terminus of D3RIL3, contains a site critical for binding to the catalytic domain of CaMKIIα. Binding of Ca2+/CaM to the regulatory domain of CaMKII is an essential step for releasing autoinhibition and activating the enzyme. Thus, Ca2+ usually regulates the binding properties of CaMKII (Bayer et al., 2001Bayer K.U. Koninck P.D. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Interaction with the NMDA receptor locks CaMKII in an active conformation.Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, Colbran and Brown, 2004Colbran R.J. Brown A.M. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and synaptic plasticity.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To determine if Ca2+ affects the CaMKIIα association with D3Rs, we tested the capacity of CaMKIIα to bind to GST-D3RIL3 in the presence of Ca2+, CaM, or both. Similar to the results from the above in vitro binding assays performed in the absence of exogenously added Ca2+/CaM, CaMKIIα showed a low level of constitutive binding to GST-D3RIL3 (L1 in Figure 2A). Interestingly, the addition of Ca2+ (0.5 mM) and CaM (1 μM) together, but not Ca2+ or CaM alone, significantly increased the amount of CaMKIIα bound to D3RIL3 (L4 versus L2 and L3 in Figures 2A and 2B). This increase was prevented by adding the Ca2+ chelator EGTA at 1 mM (L5 in Figure 2A), and could occur to CaMKIIα that was not autophosphorylated at T286, as evidenced by the fact that no T286-autophosphorylated CaMKIIα (pCaMKIIα) was detected in these binding assays with a phospho-specific antibody, due to the absence of ATP throughout the reaction (middle panel of Figure 2A). These results demonstrate that activation of CaMKIIα by Ca2+/CaM was sufficient to enhance its affinity for D3Rs. Consistent with this, an increase in the CaMKIIα-D3RIL3 binding was observed only with the wild-type (WT) CaMKIIα, but not with the Ca2+/CaM binding-defective CaMKIIα mutant T305/306D (Figures 2C and 2D) (Colbran and Soderling, 1990Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. Calcium/calmodulin-independent autophosphorylation sites of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Studies on the effect of phosphorylation of threonine 305/306 and serine 314 on calmodulin binding using synthetic peptides.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11213-11219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a peptide fragment (L290-A309) that corresponds to the CaM binding domain of CaMKII, and thereby antagonizes the CaM-CaMKII binding, blocked the Ca2+/CaM-induced enhancement of the CaMKIIα binding to D3Rs (Figure 2E). To determine if CaM itself binds to D3RIL3, we conducted in vitro binding assays with purified CaM. No binding of CaM to GST-D3RIL3 or GST was observed, whereas CaM bound to GST-CaMKIIα in a Ca2+-dependent fashion (Figure 2F). Activation of CaMKIIα by Ca2+/CaM results in autophosphorylation at T286 in the regulatory domain of adjacent CaMKIIα subunits, which “traps” CaM and keeps the enzyme in a catalytically active conformation, an autonomous (Ca2+/CaM-independent) activity, even after the initial Ca2+/CaM signal subsides (Meyer et al., 1992Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Calmodulin trapping by calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase.Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). A series of experiments was carried out to determine the influence of T286 autophosphorylation on the CaMKIIα-D3R binding. The unphosphorylated WT kinase exhibited constitutive and enhanced binding to D3RIL3 in the absence and presence of Ca2+/CaM, respectively (Figure 3A). Interestingly, WT CaMKIIα that was activated by Ca2+/CaM and autophosphorylated at T286 prior to the binding assays showed a further enhanced level of binding (L3 and L4 in Figure 3A) as compared with unphosphorylated WT, regardless of the presence or absence of Ca2+/CaM in the binding assays (Figures 3A and 3D). An autophosphorylation-defective mutant, T286A, showed the same level of binding to D3Rs in the presence or absence of ATP (Figures 3B and 3D). In contrast, a constitutively active (Ca2+/CaM-independent) mutant, T286D, that shares the property of autophosphorylated CaMKIIα, showed a high level of binding to D3Rs, which was not affected by the addition of Ca2+/CaM or Ca2+/CaM/ATP (Figures 3C and 3D). These data indicate that, while the basal (unstimulated) and Ca2+/CaM-stimulated binding to D3Rs requires no autophosphorylation, autophosphorylation of T286 further increases the capacity of CaMKIIα to bind to D3Rs. The binding properties of autophosphorylated CaMKIIα were further analyzed in binding assays with EGTA (1 mM) added at different times. As before, an increased amount of D3RIL3-bound CaMKIIα was detected when Ca2+/CaM and ATP were added for 20 min (L3 in Figure 3E). The addition of EGTA substantially inhibited the CaMKIIα binding. However, this inhibition occurred only when EGTA was added in the early phase (<2 min, L4–L6 in Figure 3E). When the binding reaction lasted long enough (2–15 min), EGTA was no longer effective (L7 and L8 in Figure 3E). The D3RIL3-bound enzyme from the ATP-containing assays was autophosphorylated at T286, and the level of this autophosphorylation paralleled well with the capacity of the enzyme in binding to D3Rs at different EGTA-adding times (Figure 3E). These data suggest that the CaMKIIα binding to D3Rs and T286 autophosphorylation are initially reversible, but become Ca2+/CaM independent when the kinase transforms to an autonomous state. Like the unphosphorylated enzyme, autophosphorylated CaMKIIα bound to the same N-terminal region (R210-P239) of D3RIL3 (Figure 3F). This region was therefore further analyzed to identify a sufficient binding motif. A panel of peptides derived from this region was used to compete with the R210-P239 fragment for binding to CaMKIIα. It was found that four out of six peptides (P1, P2, P3, and P5) blocked the binding of GST-D3RIL3(R210-P239) to active CaMKIIα (Figure S2A) or autophosphorylated CaMKIIα (Figure 3G). These four peptides, when used in a biotinylated form, pulled down CaMKIIα (Figure S2B). Thus, a 14 residue motif (RILTRQNSQCISIR) contained by all four peptides constitutes a core motif for CaMKIIα binding. Notably, this motif is highly conserved among mammals. A comparison of the amino acid sequences revealed a remarkable homology between the CaMKIIα-binding region in D3RIL3 and the sequences spanning a T286 pseudosubstrate region in CaMKIIα (Yang and Schulman, 1999Yang E. Schulman H. Structural examination of autoregulation of multifunctional calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26199-26208Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), S1303 in NR2B (Strack et al., 2000Strack S. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. Mechanism and regulation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II targeting to the NR2B subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23798-23806Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and an S/T site in two classical CaMKII substrates, autocamtide-2 and syntide-2 (Figure 4A). This suggested that D3RIL3 might serve as a phosphorylation substrate of CaMKII. Indeed, CaMKIIα phosphorylated GST-D3RIL3, but not GST, in the presence of Ca2+/CaM (Figure 4B). Similarly, CaMKIIα phosphorylated the GST-D3RIL3(R210-P239) fragment (Figure 4C). This phosphorylation was rapid (Figure 4D) and comparable to the phosphorylation of an NR2B fragment (Figure S3A). The kinetic parameter, Km, was notably low, 65.9 ± 1.2 nM (Figure 4E), suggesting that D3RIL3, like NR2B (Omkumar et al., 1996Omkumar R.V. Kiely M.J. Rosenstein A.J. Min K.T. Kennedy M.B. Identification of a phosphorylation site for calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in the NR2B subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31670-31678Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), acts as a high-affinity substrate. This high-affinity nature implies that phosphorylation of D3RIL3 could occur under physiological conditions. In support of this, GST-D3RIL3(R210-P239) was phosphorylated at two physiological Ca2+ concentrations (Figure S3B). To identify accurate phosphorylation sites within the R210-P239 fragment, we used a series of synthetic peptides with or without mutations of two known serine sites in this fragment (S229 and S233). Figure 4F shows that the WT S229/233 peptide substrate was phosphorylated by CaMKIIα to a considerable stoichiometry (0.81 mol of phosphate/mol of substrate). Mutation of S233 to alanine (S233A) did not affect the phosphorylation. In contrast, mutation of S229 to alanine (S229A) or S229/233 to alanine (S229/233A) completely abolished the phosphorylation. Thus, S229 rather than S233 or T225 is the site of phosphorylation. The fact that S229 lies within the CaMKII binding motif in D3RIL3 and aligns with a phospho-S/T site predicted from the consensus CaMKII phosphorylation sequence, (I/L)XRXX(S/T) (White et al., 1998White R.R. Kwon Y.G. Taing M. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. Definition of optimal substrate recognition motifs of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases IV and II reveals shared and distinctive features.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3166-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), is noteworthy. The results from tandem mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic digests of CaMKII-phosphorylated GST-D3RIL3 conclusively identified S229 as a phosphorylation site (data not shown). Although the CaMKIIα binding domain in D3RIL3 aligns with the substrate recognition motif and contains a high-affinity phosphorylation site (S229), a classical enzyme-substrate binding mechanism does not appear to be involved in the CaMKIIα binding to D3RIL3. This is supported by the finding that syntide-2 (a model peptide substrate for CaMKII) at concentrations up to 400 μM (>30 times the Km for phosphorylation; Hashimoto and Soderling, 1987Hashimoto Y. Soderling T.R. Calcium · calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and calcium · phospholipid-dependent protein kinase activities in rat tissues assayed with a synthetic peptide.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 252: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) failed to compete for the CaMKIIα binding to D3RIL3 (Figure S3C). D3Rs are enriched in accumbal neurons. To determine whether native CaMKIIα and D3Rs interact with each other in these neurons, coimmunoprecipitation was performed using the solubilized synaptosomal fraction (P2) from the rat NAc. A clear and specific band of CaMKIIα, but not CaMKIV, was shown in the D3R precipitates (Figure 5A). No immunoreactivity of other key synaptic proteins, including postsynaptic density (PSD)-93, PSD-95, synapse-associated protein (SAP) 97, and SAP102, was detected in the D3R precipitates (data not shown). In a reverse coimmunoprecipitation assay, a D3R-specific band was seen in the CaMKIIα precipitates (Figure 5B). CaMKIIα in D3R-expressing neurons of the rat midbrain structures (substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area) and the rat medial mammillary bodies showed no interaction with D3Rs because no coimmunoprecipitation between the two proteins was seen in the P2 fraction from these regions (Figures 5C and 5D). In the NAc, the coimmunoprecipitation was seen in WT mice, but not in D3R mutant mice (Figure S4A). Furthermore, the coimmunoprecipitation occurred in the purified PSD fraction of rat accumbal neurons (Figure S4B). These data indicate a region-specific interaction between CaMKIIα and D3Rs in the NAc in vivo and an interaction that can occur in the PSD. Further evidence supporting the interaction of the two proteins in vivo was obtained from yeast two-hybrid assays. Using D3RIL3 as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system, we found a prominent interaction between D3RIL3 and CaMKIIα (Figure S4C). The strong interaction with CaMKIIα was also seen for the D3RIL3(R210-P239), but not D3RIL3(Q240-Q375), fragment (Figure S4C). To determine whether the CaMKIIα-D3R interaction is subject to the Ca2+ regulation as was observed in vitro, we tested the interaction in the presence of the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, in rat striatal/NAc slices. Ionomycin induced a concentration-dependent increase in the amounts of CaMKIIα and pCaMKIIα(T286) in the D3R precipitates (Figure 5E). The CaMK inhibitor KN93 (20 μM), which inhibits CaMK by preventing the CaM binding to the enzyme, blocked the ionomycin-induced binding of CaMKIIα (Figure 5F) and pCaMKIIα(T286) (Figure S5) to D3Rs. The inactive analog of KN93, KN92, had no effect (Figures 5F and S5). Like KN93, the highly selective CaMKII inhibitory peptide Tat-CaMKIINtide (Chang et al., 1998Chang B.H. Mukherji S.

Cell. 2007; 18: 5024-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) at 5 μM (1 hr before ionomycin) blocked the effect of ionomycin (Figure 5G). These results demonstrate a Ca2+-sensitive nature of CaMKIIα-D3R interactions in vivo. To evaluate the role of CaMKIIα-D3RIL3 binding in vivo, we synthesized a Tat-fusion peptide (Tat-D3Rr). The peptide contains a Tat domain (YGRKKRRQRRR) from the human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) and a CaMKIIα-binding motif (RILTRQNSQCISIRP) from D3RIL3 (Figure 5H). The arginine-enriched Tat domain renders cell permeability (Aarts et al., 2002Aarts M. Liu Y. Liu L. Besshoh S. Arundine M. Gurd J.W. Wang Y.T. Salter M.W. Tymianski M.

In pull-down assays with biotinylated Tat-fusion peptides, Tat-D3Rr, but not Tat-D3Rt (a sequence-scrambled control), pulled down recombinant and endogenous CaMKIIα (Figure S6A), indicating the ability of Tat-D3Rr to bind to CaMKIIα. Tat-D3Rr (5–10 μM, 1 hr before ionomycin) substantially reduced the ionomycin-stimulated association of the two proteins in striatal/NAc slices, while Tat-D3Rt did not (Figure 5H). Thus, active CaMKIIα was directly recruited to D3RIL3 in response to Ca2+ rises. Ionomycin was found to increase serine phosphorylation of D3Rs as detected by an antibody selective for phosphoserine (Figure 5I). This increase no longer occurred in slices pretreated with Tat-D3Rr (Figure 5I) or KN93 (Figure S6B), indicating that the interaction of active CaMKIIα with D3RIL3 is required for the ionomycin-stimulated phosphorylation of the receptor. The selectivity of Tat-D3Rr in disrupting the CaMKIIα-D3R interaction was confirmed by the lack of its effect in interfering with the ionomycin-stimulated CaMKIIα interaction with a number of other CaMKII substrates, including NR2B, the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 activator p35, or α-actinin-1 (Figure S7). To identify the receptors that might provide a Ca2+ entry to trigger the CaMKIIα association to D3Rs, we tested the effect of glutamate receptor activation on the interaction in NAc slices. Glutamate mimicked the effect of ionomycin in stimulating the CaMKIIα-D3R association (Figure 6A). The effect of glutamate was blocked by KN93 and the NMDA receptor antagonist MK801, but not by KN92 and the AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI52466 (Figure 6B). Thus, glutamate, through activating NMDA receptors, elevates the CaMKIIα-D3R association. In support of this, NMDA itself induced a concentration-dependent and rapid increase in the association of the two proteins (Figures 6C and 6D). FPL64176, an activator of L-type voltage-operated Ca2+ channels (VOCCs), slightly enhanced the CaMKIIα-D3R interaction, which was blocked by the antagonist nifedipine (Figure 6E). Together, VOCCs and especially NMDA receptors can provide a Ca2+ entry to trigger the CaMKIIα-D3R association. Activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI)-linked D1Rs (Gαq-coupled) rather than classical cAMP-linked D1Rs (Gαs-coupled) elicits the Ca2+ release from intracellular stores through a phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ)-dependent and adenylyl-cyclase-independent mechanism (Felder et al., 1989Felder C.C. Jose P.A. Axelrod J. The dopamine-1 agonist, SKF82526, stimulates phospholipase-C activity independent of adenylate cyclase.J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Exp. Ther. 1990; 253: 987-992PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if the Ca2+ release induced by activating PI-linked D1Rs affects the CaMKIIα-D3R interaction, we examined the effect of activating these receptors on the interaction of the two proteins in NAc slices. Pharmacological activation of PI-linked D1Rs with a selective agonist SKF83959 (Jin et al., 2003Jin L.Q. Goswami S. Cai G. Zhen X. Friedman E. SKF83959 selectively regulates phosphatidylinositol-linked D1 dopamine receptors in rat brain.J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 378-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) increased the interaction of CaMKIIα with D3Rs (Figure 6F). This increase was blocked by the D1R antagonist SCH23390, the amino steroid PLCβ inhibitor U73122 (but not its inactive analog U73343), and Tat-CaMKIINtide (Figure 6F). Thus, the Ca2+ release by PI-linked D1Rs possesses the ability to upregulate the CaMKIIα-D3R interaction. The previous data showing the selective activation of CaMKII by PI-linked, but not cAMP-linked, D1Rs (Zhen et al., 2004Zhen X. Goswami S. Abdali S.A. Gil M. Bakshi K. Friedman E.

Global pyramidal cell glutamate stimulation induces translocation of CaMKII from dendritic shafts to spines. Here we show that local dendritic stimulation by puffing glutamate onto a region containing 7–32 synapses induces translocation of CaMKII to synapses initially at the puff site but that translocation subsequently spreads within dendrites to the distal dendrite arbor, resulting in a persistent, widespread synaptic accumulation. This locally induced propagating synaptic (L-IPS) accumulation of CaMKII requires activation of NMDA receptors and L-type Ca2+ channels and is preceded by a Ca2+ spike. L-IPS translocation of CaMKII alters biochemical signaling and is associated with an increase in AMPA receptor GluR1 at both stimulated and nonstimulated synapses and thus provides a molecular mechanism for heterosynaptic plasticity."

In general, lymphokine expression in T-cells, including IL-2, is controlled to a substantial degree by the action of NFAT transcription factors (2Serfling E. Berberich-Siebelt F. Chuvpilo S.

NFATc1 and NFATc2 are highly expressed in peripheral T-cells and control, in particular, the expression of lymphokines. Additional targets controlled by NFATs are the promoters of p21Waf1 (CDKN1A), CD40 ligand (CD40LG), CD95 ligand (FASLG), and NFATC1 itself. Studies on NFAT-deficient mice suggest that NFATc1 and -c2 have divergent functions in lymphokine gene expression in vivo. Although NFATc2-/- mice suffer from lymphoproliferative disorder, peripheral T-cells from NFATc1-/- mice are rather defective in proliferation. This suggests contrasting roles in T-cell proliferation and activation for NFATc1 and -c2. The effects on IL-2, the lymphokine important for proliferation, are negligible in the case of NFATc2-/- and ambiguous for NFATc1-/-, i.e. one of two knock-out strains investigated synthesized more IL-2 after secondary stimulation (5Ranger A.M.

The long isoforms c1/αC and βC harbor an extra C-terminal peptide of 246 aa constituting an additional transactivation domain, TAD-B (7Chuvpilo S. Avots A. Berberich-Siebelt F. Glockner J. Fischer C.

Interestingly, the long C terminus of NFATc1 is homologous to the C terminus of NFATc2 (7Chuvpilo S. Avots A. Berberich-Siebelt F. Glockner J. Fischer C. Kerstan A. Escher C. Inashkina I. Hlubek F.

Therefore, the question arises of whether NFATc1/C functionally resembles NFATc2 or has a function of its own, different from NFATc1/A and NFATc2.Functions of proteins can be achieved by post-translational modification, for example with SUMO. Similar to ubiquitinylation, sumoylation is mediated by activating E1, conjugating E2, and ligating E3 enzymes. Sumoylation occurs mostly within the consensus core motif Ψ-Lys-X-Glu, where Ψ is a large hydrophobic aa (8Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Pearce D. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2000; 20: 6040-6050Google Scholar, 9Gill G. Genes Dev... 2004; 18: 2046-2059Google Scholar). Sumoylation often correlates with relocalization of the targeted proteins toward promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-nbs) (10Verger A.

Accordingly, although sumoylation of transcription factors might occasionally enhance, most often it represses their activation capacity (12Gill G. Curr. Opin. Genet.

They house various kinds of protein factors involved in gene regulation, DNA repair, tumor suppression, and apoptosis. Accordingly, posttranslational modifications and protein-protein interactions with residual proteins occur. Established members of PML-nbs are histone acetylases and deacetylases (HDACs). (Hyper)-acetylation at lysines in N-terminal tails of core histones regulates transcription. Hypoacetylation on the other hand, poses the locus for subsequent changes such as methylation of the deacetylated lysines, leading to heterochromatinization and silencing (15Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science.. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Google Scholar).Here we show that NFATc1 is sumoylated endogenously in CD4+ T-cells, because the long isoform of NFATc1, NFATc1/C, is targeted at two sites within its C-specific terminus by SUMO1. Sumoylation directs NFATc1/C into PML-nbs. Furthermore, sumoylated NFATc1/C recruits HDACs, leading to deacetylation of histones within the IL-2 promoter. This is in agreement with the localization of NFATc1/C to heterochromatin. Surprisingly, only some NFATc1 target genes, especially IL-2, are suppressed, whereas others, such as IFNγ and IL-13, are even enhanced. This indicates that sumoylation is necessary for the fine-tuning of NFATc1 function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Stimulations—Human lymphoid A3.01 and murine EL-4 thymoma cells as well as 293T human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were cultured and stimulated as before (11Berberich-Siebelt F. Berberich I. Andrulis M. Santner-Nanan B. Jha M.K. Klein-Hessling S. Schimpl A. Serfling E. J. Immunol... 2006; 176: 4843-4851Google Scholar).Conventional CD4+ T-cells (GK1.5-FITC) and CD25+ Treg cells (7D4-PE) were isolated (16Bopp T. Becker C. Klein M. Klein-Hessling S. Palmetshofer A.

Med... 2007; 204: 1303-1310Google Scholar) from spleen cells by positive selection using high gradient MACS (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The CD4-sort as well as the CD25-sort was performed twice. CD4+ T-cells were subsequently depleted from CD25+ Treg cells using monoclonal antibody PC61 and enriched >99%. They showed no proliferative response in the presence of Con A or soluble anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, indicating negligible contamination with accessory cells. CD25+-enriched Treg cells were additionally depleted from CD8+ T-cells using anti-CD8 Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech, Hamburg, Germany), and the purity of the resulting CD25+ Treg cells was typically >95%. Preactivation of CD25+ Treg cells was performed using a combination of plate-bound anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb; 145-2C11, 3 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 mAb (37.51; 10 μg/ml) in the presence of murine recombinant interleukin-2 (100 ng/ml). After 72 h the cells were harvested and cultured again in the absence of any stimulus for additional 48 h.DNA Constructs—Luciferase reporter gene plasmid pTATAluc+ (17Altschmied J. Duschl J. Biotechniques.. 1997; 23: 436-438Google Scholar) containing 293 bp of the proximal murine IL-2 promoter (18Serfling E. Avots A. Neumann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1995; 1263: 181-200Google Scholar), retroviral vectors pEGZ/MCS (19Kuss A.W. Knodel M. Berberich-Siebelt F. Lindemann D. Schimpl A. Berberich I. Eur. J. Immunol... 1999; 29: 3077-3088Google Scholar) and pEGZ/MCS-HA, and pHA-hNFATc1/A (HA-c1/A) and pHA-hNFATc1/C (HA-c1/C) expression constructs have been described previously (20Chuvpilo S. Zimmer M. Kerstan A. Glockner J. Avots A. Escher C. Fischer C. Inashkina I. Jankevics E. Berberich-Siebelt F. Schmitt E. Serfling E. Immunity.. 1999; 10: 261-269Google Scholar). In addition, NFATc1 isoforms, mutants, and C-terminal peptides were fused at their 3′ ends to the modified hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor as described for a chimeric cMycER™ construct (21Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res... 1995; 23: 1686-1690Google Scholar) or, accordingly, to enhanced yellow fluorescence protein (EYFP) (bicistronic vector pIZ-EYFP). In the case of the C-terminal peptides fused to the estrogen receptor (ER), a nuclear localization signal (5′-GATCTACCTTACGTTTTTTCTTTGGTG-3′) was added in between. SUMO1 was fused in-frame to the 5′ end of NFATc1. The mutations of lysines to arginines within the SUMO sites of NFATc1 were designed as K349R (5′-CAGTGGCGCTCCGGGTGGAGCCC-3′, K702R (5′-CGTTCCAATTATACGAACAGAACCCAC-3′), and K914R (5′-CTGTAACGGTCCGGCGAGAGCC-3′).Transient transfection and reporter gene assay. 293T HEK cells were transfected by using the conventional calcium phosphate technique and EL-4 cells by a standard DEAE/Dextran protocol. 36 h post-transfection, luciferase activity was measured from the cells that were either left untreated or treated with TPA plus ionomycin (T/I) overnight. Relative light units were corrected for the transfection efficacy due to total protein concentrations (relative luciferase activity = 0.5/protein concentrations × absolute luciferase activity). Normalized mean values of at least three independent experiments are depicted in relative light units or as -fold activation over empty vector control in the cotransfection experiments. To check the equal expression pattern of the exogenously expressed proteins, Western blots were performed from the same protein extracts loading exactly the amount of lysate as revealed for calculation of luciferase activity. EL-4 cells were evaluated by green fluorescence as well as cotransfected with pCMV-GLuc (New England Biolabs) as a reference. For immunofluorescence (IF), 293T HEK cells were transfected by Superfect method according to the Qiagen protocol with various HA-NFATc1 and FLAG-SUMO-1 constructs. After 48 h of transfection, cells were stimulated with 10 ng of TPA, 1 μm ionomycin, and 2 mm CaCl2.Viral Infection, RNA Purification, RNase Protection Assay, Real-time PCR, and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Viral infection was carried out as described previously (22Berberich-Siebelt F. Klein-Hessling S. Hepping N. Santner-Nanan B. Lindemann D. Schimpl A. Berberich I. Serfling E. Eur. J. Immunol... 2000; 30: 2576-2585Google Scholar). RNA was purified using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and 5 μg of RNA was analyzed by RNase protection assays performed according to the Pharmingen Riboquant™ protocol. As multi-probe template set, the mCK1 or hCK1 set was used. cDNA was synthesized with RevertAid Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase following the recommendations of the supplier (MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). Real-time PCR was performed using the following oligonucleotides: primers for NFATc1 E1+E3 and E2+E3 (qNFATc1Ex1F 5′-CGGGAGCGGAGAAACTTTGC-3′, qNFATc1Ex2F 5′-AGGACCCGGAGTTCGACTTC-3′, qNFATc1Ex3R 5′-CAGGGTCGAGGTGACACTAG-3′), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (forward), GTT GGA TAC AGG CCA GAC TTT GTT G; HGPRT (reverse), GAG GGT AGG CTG GCC TAT AGG CT. For detection of NFATc2 mRNA, the Quanti-Tect primer assay Mm_NFATc2_SG (Qiagen) was used. Real-time PCR analyses to quantify the expression of NFATc1 E1+E3, NFATc1 E2+E3, NFATc2, and HGPRT mRNAs were performed in triplicate on an iCycler (Bio-Rad) using the Absolute PCR SYBR Green Mixes (Abgene). After normalization of the data according to the expression of HGPRT mRNA, the relative expression levels of NFATc1 E1+E3, NFATc1 E2+E3, and NFATc2 mRNAs were calculated. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed for detection of IL-2 secretion using monoclonal antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences).Immunoprecipitations (IP) and Western or Immunoblot (IB) Assays—For IP, post-transfection 107 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), and 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma-Aldrich). 50 μl were kept as a lysate control. Otherwise, the whole cell extract was incubated with 3 μg of anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma), 3 μg of anti-Myc (sc-40, Santa Cruz) or 3 μg of NFATc1 antibody (AB1-205, ImmunoGlobe), and 40 μl of protein A or G beads (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The beads were washed 3 times with buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitor mixture). For Western blots, the precipitates and input control lysates were fractionated by 8-12% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. For detection, anti-HA (M-12CA, Roche Diagnostics), anti-FLAG, anti-SUMO (sc-5308, Santa Cruz) or anti-Myc and a peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody were used with a standard enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce). When endogenous sumoylation was tested, at first nuclei were prepared as for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, a total of 15 μg of anti-NFATc1 (raised against the common N-terminal fragment of NFATc1, expressed as a fusion with glutathione S-transferase, Pineda Antibody Service, Berlin, Germany or 556602, mouse IgG1, BD Pharmingen) were used for IP, and the subsequent Western blot was analyzed by anti-SUMO (sc-5308, Santa Cruz) and finally detected with SuperSignal West Femto trial kit (Thermo Scientific/Pierce).ChIP—ChIP analysis was carried out as described (11Berberich-Siebelt F. Berberich I. Andrulis M. Santner-Nanan B. Jha M.K. Klein-Hessling S. Schimpl A. Serfling E. J. Immunol... 2006; 176: 4843-4851Google Scholar, 23Soutoglou E. Talianidis I. Science.. 2002; 295: 1901-1904Google Scholar) but with the addition of 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma-Aldrich) within the lysis buffer. 1 × 107 cells were fixed for 5 min at room temperature with 1% formaldehyde. 30 units (A260) of chromatin were immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-acetylhistone 3 H3-Ac (#06-599, Upstate), anti-ERα (sc-542, Santa Cruz), or anti-HDAC2 (#39533, Active Motif) and subsequently by protein-A-Sepharose. DNA was purified from reverse-cross-linked chromatin followed by PCR amplification (1/10 of the immunoprecipitated DNA and input DNA) using primer pairs for either the human IL-2 promoter or the β-actin promoter: human IL-2_for (5′-CTT GCT CTT GTT CAC CA-3′) plus human IL-2_rev (5′-CTG TAC ATT GTG GCA GGA-3′). giving rise to a 493-bp fragment. and hβ-ac_for (5′-CCT CCT CCT CTT CCT CA-3′) plus hβ-ac_rev (5′-CGA GCC ATA AAA GGC AA-3′). giving rise to 193-bp DNA.IF and Confocal Microscopy—For NFATc1, SUMO-1, and PML triple colocalization as well as for heterochromatin and polymerase II (pol II) colocalization studies, NFATc1-ER-infected A3.01 cells were harvested on slides by cytospins, whereas transiently transfected 293T HEK cells had been grown on coverslips. Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 followed by blocking in 1:20 times diluted donkey serum for 20 min. For primary antibody staining, rabbit polyclonal NFATc1-NT (1:200), mouse monoclonal HA (1:500), mouse SUMO-1 (1:50), goat PML (1:50, sc-9862, Santa Cruz), rabbit polyclonal anti-trimethylhistone H3 (Lys-9, 1:500, 07-442, Upstate), and mouse monoclonal pol II (1:500, 05-623, Upstate) antibody were used. The secondary antibody combination used was anti-rabbit Cy3 (1:500), anti-mouse Cy5 (1:500), and anti-goat Cy2 (1:100) (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The slides were mounted with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates) containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Images were collected with a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP2 equipment, objective lens: HEX PL APO, 40×/1.25-0.75) and analyzed by Leica LCS software. The images were digitally zoomed 6 or 7 times. For endogenous NFATc1 sumoylation, mouse CD4+ and CD4+CD25+ T-cells were collected on slides by cytospins (300 rpm, 2 min) and dried overnight at room temperature. Formaldehyde fixation, permeabilization and staining were performed as mentioned above. Quantitation was done as follows; cells clearly showing more than 50% (usually above 75%) merging of NFAT dots and SUMO/PML-nb dots were considered as a positive score. Roughly 100 cells were evaluated, and the percentage of positive cells was calculated.RESULTSNFATc1/C Interacts with the SUMO-conjugating Enzyme Ubc9—A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using the NFATc1/C-specific C-terminal peptide as bait and a human spleen cDNA library as prey. Ubc9 (37x) and PIAS1 (4x) were detected as the predominant NFATc1/C-specific interaction partners. Ubc9 is the only known SUMO-conjugating enzyme, whereas PIAS1 acts as a substrate-specific SUMO ligase. Indeed, within NFATc1/αC (c1/αC), three SUMO consensus sites were identified at the position of aa 349, 702, and 914, whereas the shortest isoforms of NFATc1/A (c1/A) harbor only the site at aa 349 (Fig. 1A). In NFATc1/βC the corresponding sites are K349, K689, and K901. The N-terminal α- or β-peptides are free of SUMO-consensus sites. In silico analysis predicts a strong sumoylation for the C-terminal SUMO consensus sites at lysines 702 and 914 and a slightly weaker sumoylation for the common SUMO site at lysine 349. 6A. Nayak, J. Glöckner-Pagel, M. Vaeth, J. E. Schumann, M. Buttmann, T. Bopp, E. Schmitt, E. Serfling, and F. Berberich-Siebelt, unpublished data. To create ΔSUMO mutants, the sumoylatable lysines were altered to arginines by site-directed mutagenesis, and the corresponding NFATc1 mutants are designated with K349R, K702R, or K914R for both lysines on the C terminus mutated, K702R/K914R, and in case of the triple mutation, K349R/K702R/K914R. For better comparison, all constructs contain the N-terminal α-peptide.The authenticity of the yeast two-hybrid screens was verified by cotransfecting 293T HEK cells with constructs encoding HA-tagged NFATc1, wild type, and mutants and FLAG-tagged Ubc9 followed by IP. c1/C could be precipitated with Ubc9 by anti-FLAG but not upon cotransfection with the empty vector pcFLAG (Fig. 1B). In the immunoprecipitations with wild type, at least two precipitated bands were detected. Interestingly, in immunoprecipitations with K349R/K702R/K914R, no bands appeared, indicating that the SUMO consensus sites in c1/C are necessary for proper Ubc9 interaction (Fig. 1C). When all different SUMO site-deficient mutants were analyzed for Ubc9 interaction, the first site within the C terminus, Lys-702, proved to be the most important one, whereas the mutation Lys-349 did not influence the binding of Ubc9 at all (Fig. 1D). Therefore, interaction of Ubc9 should be mainly directed to the C-terminal peptide. And indeed, precipitation of Ubc9 was able to pull down the full C-terminal peptide fused to enhanced yellow fluorescence protein (Fig. 1E) and even when divided into the B terminus-specific (B) and the remaining far C terminus-specific (CC) peptides (Fig. 1F; for fragments see Fig. 1A). We conclude that both NFATc1/C-specific SUMO sites are able to efficiently interact with Ubc9.Lysines 702 and 914 within the C-terminal Peptide of NFATc1/C Are Potent Sumoylation Sites—We next sought to check if c1/C is indeed ligated to SUMO. To this end vectors expressing HA-tagged c1/C and FLAG-SUMO1 were cotransfected into 293T HEK cells. After immunoprecipitation, 3 (-4) SUMO-modified c1/C bands were observed (Fig. 2A). To see whether the predicted SUMO sites and the (de-)phosphorylation state of NFATc1/C are of importance, 293T HEK cells were transfected either with plasmids expressing c1/C or K349R/K702R/K914R along with FLAG-SUMO1 or pcFLAG (Fig. 2B). Cells were left untreated or activated by T/I, which mimics T-cell receptor signaling, thereby leading to dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFATs. SUMO-modified c1/C bands were detected in both untreated and T/I-treated cells (Fig. 2B, first two lanes). More importantly, no SUMO-modified band could be detected in NFATc1/C-K349R/K702R/K914R protein (Fig. 2B). Because SENPs (SUMO-specific proteases) render sumoylation very transient, the necessity of N-ethylmaleimide (a SENP inhibitor) within the lysis buffer was checked. Accordingly, robust c1/C sumoylation could only be observed when N-ethylmaleimide was added, which points to the dynamic and transient nature of NFATc1 sumoylation (supplemental Fig. S1A).FIGURE 2NFATc1/C is sumoylated in vivo. A, NFATc1/C was sumoylated. HA-tagged c1/C-coding vector was transfected into 293T HEK cells either with FLAG-tagged SUMO1- or FLAG-expressing pcDNA, and cells were treated with T/I for 6 h. Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation was followed by IB with anti-HA (arrows, SUMO-modified NFATc1/C) and whole cell lysates (WCL) were analyzed for expression by anti-HA and anti-FLAG. B, the SUMO site-deficient mutant K349R/K702R/K914R cannot be sumoylated. Procedures were as in A, but K349R/K702R/K914R was included, and cells were left unstimulated or treated for 6 h as indicated. C, SUMO site mutants reveal site-specific sumoylation pattern of c1/C. HA-tagged c1/C and different SUMO site mutants of c1/C were subjected to IP as in A, and expression was compared by anti-HA (NFAT) and anti-FLAG (SUMO) IB in whole cell lysates. D, NFATc1 precipitation reveals sumoylated c1/C. Procedures were as in A, except NFATc1/C-ER-stimulated by Tm + T/I for 4 h, and either anti-ER or anti-NFATc1 was used for IP and anti-SUMO1 for IB. E, in CD4+ T-cells endogenous NFATc1 is sumoylated. Nuclei from CD4+ T-cells after 7 days restimulated or not by ionomycin or T/I for 5 h were subjected to IP and IB as in D; IP-anti-NFATc1 + IB-anti-SUMO1 (arrow, sumoylated NFATc1/C, fourth lane, no antibody for IP); reprobe of IB by anti-NFATc1, IB of nuclear lysates (NL) by anti-SUMO1 and anti-NFATc1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To analyze the individual sumoylation sites in c1/C, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed after cotransfecting 293T HEK cells with HA-tagged NFATc1/C-encoding constructs, either NFATc1/C wild type or different ΔSUMO mutants (single Lys to Arg, K702R/K914R and K349R/K702R/K914R) and FLAG-tagged SUMO1 expression vector (Fig. 2C). Transfection of the construct encoding wild type resulted in three prominent and one uppermost weak SUMO-specific band (arrows). In the case of K702R, bands 1 and 3 persisted, whereas band 2 disappeared, suggesting this band as being specific for lysine 702 sumoylation. On the other hand, band 2 persisted in transfections with K914R, whereas bands 1 and 3 disappeared, indicating those two as specific for lysine 914 sumoylation. Furthermore, the overall sumoylation efficiency of K702R and K914R was drastically reduced compared with wild type c1/C. Intriguingly, the common SUMO site mutant K349R gave rise to the same, although weaker, banding pattern as wild type c1/C, implying that in the presence of strong SUMO sites at lysine 702 and 914, the internal site at lysine 349 is less important for sumoylation. To verify the dominance of the C-terminal sites, transfections were performed with K702R/K914R. As expected, no SUMO-specific bands could be observed. This proved that the lysine 349 is irrelevant or totally dependent on C-terminal sumoylation. No bands of sumoylated NFATc1/C could be detected for the triple ΔSUMO mutant K349R/K702R/K914R.We further examined sumoylation of the short isoform NFATc1/A which only harbors the common SUMO site at lysine 349. Surprisingly, we detected weak sumoylation of c1/A which was abolished in the case of c1/AK-349R (supplemental Fig. S1B). This indicates that this site is a true, but extremely weak sumoylation site. The latter conclusion is supported by the fact that no function could be pinpointed to this particular site (see below). Taken together, the long isoform-specific sites at lysines 702 and 914 are the most important sites for NFATc1/C sumoylation, and mutation in any of those leads to a dramatic reduction in overall sumoylation pattern.NFATc1/C Is Sumoylated in Vivo—Although typically only a small proportion of proteins can be identified as sumoylated (24Hay R.T. Mol. Cell.. 2005; 18: 1-12Google Scholar) and detection of endogenous sumoylation is described as very difficult, we analyzed if sumoylation of NFATc1 could be verified in primary T-cells. First, antibodies were tested in transfection experiments. Reverse experiments as before were performed with precipitation of c1/C-ER by anti-ER and anti-NFATc1 and Western blot detection by anti-SUMO1 antibodies. Identical banding pattern proved the specificity of c1/C sumoylation as well as the usefulness of the anti-NFATc1 antibody for precipitation of endogenous NFATc1 (Fig. 2D). On the other hand, the experiment demonstrated the comparably low amount of sumoylated NFAT detectable, when no exogenous SUMO1 was present (Fig. 2D, third lane). For evaluation of in vivo sumoylation, CD4+ T-cells were isolated from lymph nodes and stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 plus IL-2 for 3 days and rested for a further 4 days in the presence of IL-2. Then NFATc1, mainly c1/C; see Fig. 4E (E2 + E3), was translocated to the nucleus upon treatment with the Ca2+ ionophor ionomycin, where the autoregulatory loop leads to the predominant reexpression of the short isoform (25Chuvpilo S. Jankevics E. Tyrsin D. Akimzhanov A. Moroz D. Jha M.K. Schulze-Luehrmann J. Santner-Nanan B. Feoktistova E. Konig T. Avots A. Schmitt E. Berberich-Siebelt F. Schimpl A. Serfling E.

https://openalex.org/W2004838004,"Huntington disease and its related autosomal-dominant polyglutamine (pQ) neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by intraneuronal accumulation of protein aggregates. Studies on protein aggregates have revealed the importance of the ubiquitin-proteasome system as the front line of protein quality control (PQC) machinery against aberrant proteins. Recently, we have shown that the autophagy-lysosomal system is also involved in cytoplasmic aggregate degradation, but the nucleus lacked this activity. Consequently, the nucleus relies entirely on the ubiquitin-proteasome system for PQC. According to previous studies, nuclear aggregates possess a higher cellular toxicity than do their cytoplasmic counterparts, however degradation kinetics of nuclear aggregates have been poorly understood. Here we show that nuclear ubiquitin ligases San1p and UHRF-2 each enhance nuclear pQ aggregate degradation and rescued pQ-induced cytotoxicity in cultured cells and primary neurons. Moreover, UHRF-2 is associated with nuclear inclusion bodies in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that UHRF-2 is an essential molecule for nuclear pQ degradation as a component of nuclear PQC machinery in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2000099917,"The dendritic morphology of neurons dictates their abilities to process and transmit information; however, the signaling pathways that regulate dendritic growth and complexity are poorly understood. Here, we show that retinoids induce the expression of the FERM Rho-GEF protein FARP1 in the developing spinal cord. FARP1 is expressed in subsets of motor neurons and is enriched in dendrites of lateral motor column (LMC) neurons that innervate the limb. FARP1 is necessary and sufficient to promote LMC dendritic growth but does not affect dendrite number or axonal morphology. We show that FARP1 serves as a specific effector of transmembrane Semaphorin6A and PlexinA4 signals to regulate LMC dendritic growth, and that its Rho-GEF domain is necessary for this function. These findings reveal that retinoid and Sema6A/PlexA4 signaling pathways intersect through FARP1 to control dendritic growth, and uncover the existence of subtype-specific signaling networks that control dendritic developmental programs in spinal motor neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2075323414,"SUV39H1 is a histone H3K9-specific methyltransferase important for heterochromatin formation, regulation of gene expression, and induction of senescence in premalignant cells. SUV39H1 forms a complex with SirT1, and its activity is stimulated by SirT1 binding. Here we present evidence that the product of the DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer 1) gene disrupts the SUV39H1-SirT1 complex. Furthermore, DBC1 binds to the SUV39H1 catalytic domain and inhibits its ability to methylate histone H3 in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of endogenous DBC1 increased the level of cellular H3K9 methylation. As expected, DBC1 also binds to SirT1 and inhibits the deacetylase activity of SirT1. These results identify DBC1 as a novel cellular inhibitor of SUV39H1 activity. DBC1 may be an important regulator of heterochromatin formation and genomic stability by disrupting the SUV39H1-SirT1 complex and inactivating both enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2048009190,"Synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion is a fine-tuned process requiring a concert of fusion machineries. Using cortical neurons from snapin-deficient mice, we reveal a role for Snapin in facilitating synchronous release. In addition to reduced frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mini-EPSCs) and smaller release-ready vesicle pool (RRP) size, snapin deficiency results in EPSCs with multiple peaks and increased rise and decay times, reflecting “desynchronized” SV fusion. These defects impair both synaptic precision and efficacy during sustained neurotransmission. Transient expression of Snapin not only rescues the slowed kinetics of EPSCs, but also further accelerates the rate found in wild-type neurons. Furthermore, expression of Snapin-C66A, a dimerization-defective mutant with impaired interactions with SNAP-25 and Synaptotagmin, reduces the RRP size but exhibits less effect on synchronized fusion. Our studies provide mechanistic insights into a dual role of Snapin in enhancing the efficacy of SV priming and in fine-tuning synchronous SV fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1969630370,"Bromodomains are acetyl lysine binding modules found in many complexes that regulate gene transcription. In budding yeast, the coactivator complex SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyl-transferase) predominantly facilitates transcription of stress-activated genes and requires the bromodomain of the Gcn5 subunit for full activation of a number of these genes. This bromodomain has previously been shown to promote retention of the complex to H3 and H4 acetylated nucleosomes. Because the SAGA complex mediates histone H3 acetylation, we sought to determine to what extent the Gcn5 bromodomain directly modulates histone acetylation activity. Kinetic analysis of SAGA-mediated acetylation of nucleosomal substrates reveals that this bromodomain: 1) is required for the cooperative acetylation of nucleosomes, 2) enhances acetylation of an H3 histone tail when the other H3 tail within a nucleosome is already acetylated, and 3) augments the acetylation turnover of nucleosomes previously acetylated at lysine 16 of the histone H4 tails. These results indicate that the Gcn5 bromodomain promotes the establishment of nucleosome acetylation through multiple mechanisms and more generally show how chromatin recognition domains can modulate the enzymatic activity of chromatin modifying complexes."

We recently demonstrated that a lipoprotein fraction obtained from S. aureus by Triton X-114 phase partitioning is a potent activator of TLR2. In this study, we separated TLR2-activating lipoproteins expressed in S. aureus and characterized an N-terminal structure. The lipoprotein fraction of S. aureus was prepared by glass bead disruption followed by Triton X-114 phase partitioning. The TLR2-activating molecules were mainly detected in the mass range of 30–35 kDa. Seven lipoproteins were identified by the mass spectra of their tryptic digests. Among them, three lipoproteins were separated by preparative SDS-PAGE and proved to activate TLR2. After digestion with trypsin in the presence of sodium deoxycholate, the N terminus of the lipopeptide was isolated from lipoprotein SAOUHSC_02699 by normal phase high pressure liquid chromatography and characterized as an S-(diacyloxypropyl)cystein-containing peptide using tandem mass spectra. The synthetic lipopeptide counterpart also stimulated the cells via TLR2. These results showed that the diacylated lipoprotein from S. aureus acts as a TLR2 ligand in mammalian cells. Staphylococcus aureus is known to activate mammalian immune cells through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). We recently demonstrated that a lipoprotein fraction obtained from S. aureus by Triton X-114 phase partitioning is a potent activator of TLR2. In this study, we separated TLR2-activating lipoproteins expressed in S. aureus and characterized an N-terminal structure.

Bacterial infection is one of the major causes of death. Staphylococcus aureus, the most common Gram-positive pathogen, is a major source of mortality in medical facilities (1Lowy F.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 520-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (4673) Google Scholar). The pathogen causes various infectious diseases, including sepsis, endocarditis, and pneumonia. During the infection, S. aureus activates cells and evokes serious inflammation in the host. TLR2 2The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; mTLR2, murine TLR2; LTA, lipoteichoic acid; MALDI-TOF-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; PGN, peptidoglycan; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; TNF, tumor necrosis factor. has been shown to play a crucial role in the host response to S. aureus (2Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2800) Google Scholar). However, a detailed understanding of the molecular components that interact with TLR2 in S. aureus cells has not yet been obtained. One of the reported TLR2 ligands was peptidoglycan (PGN) (3Schwandner R. Dziarski R. Wesche H. Rothe M. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17406-17409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), a cell wall component of most bacteria. However, Travassos et al. (4Travassos L.H. Girardin S.E. Philpott D.J. Blanot D. Nahori M.A. Werts C. Boneca I.G. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1000-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) recently showed that PGN from several bacteria that were highly purified by removal of lipoproteins or lipoteichoic acid (LTA) were not detected by TLR2. Moreover, the minimal active components of the PGN, muramyl dipeptide and desmuramyl dipeptide (γ-d-glutamyl diaminopimelic acid), were determined to be ligands of the intracellular innate immune receptor Nod2/Nod1 (5Inohara N. Ogura Y. Fontalba A. Gutierrez O. Pons F. Crespo J. Fukase K. Inamura S. Kusumoto S. Hashimoto M. Foster J.S. Moran P.A. Fernandez-Luna L.J. Nunñez G. J. Biol.

Kusumoto S. Valvano M.A. Foster S.J. Mak T.W. Nunñez G. Inohara N. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), suggesting that PGN is not a ligand of TLR2. Another candidate of TLR2-activating ligands is LTA, a cell surface glycoconjugate of Gram-positive bacteria (3Schwandner R. Dziarski R. Wesche H. Rothe M. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17406-17409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Morath et al. (7Morath S. Geyer A. Hartung T. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) reported that LTA from S. aureus is a potent stimulator of cytokine release, whereas our group demonstrated that LTA from enterococci, also a major Gram-positive pathogen, has no cytokine-producing activity (8Suda Y. Tochio H. Kawano K. Takada H. Yoshida T. Kotani S. Kusumoto S. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1995; 12: 97-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hashimoto M. Yasuoka J. Suda Y. Takada H. Yoshida T. Kotani S. Kusumoto S. J. Biochem. 1997; 121: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Han et al. (10Han S.H. Kim J.H. Martin M. Michalek S.M. Nahm M.H. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 5541-5548Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) showed that LTA from pneumococci is 100-fold less potent than staphylococcal LTA. These observations suggested that LTA is not a common ligand of TLR2 in Gram-positive pathogens. We also found that the enterococcal LTA fraction contains some contaminants other than LTA and that these components activate immune cells through TLR2 (8Suda Y. Tochio H. Kawano K. Takada H. Yoshida T. Kotani S. Kusumoto S. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1995; 12: 97-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hashimoto M. Imamura Y. Morichika T. Arimoto K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. Aoyama K. Tamura T. Kotani S. Suda Y. Kusumoto S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, their structures were not identified at that time. TLR2 is known to be a predominant receptor for lipoproteins derived from various bacteria. We have previously shown that the lipoprotein-containing fraction from S. aureus stimulates activation of immune cells through TLR2 (12Hashimoto M. Tawaratsumida K. Kariya H. Aoyama A. Tamura T. Suda Y. Int. Immunol. 2006; 18: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Recently, Stoll et al. (13Stoll H. Dengjel J. Nerz C. Götz F. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) constructed a lipoprotein diacylglycerol transferase deletion (Δlgt) mutant of S. aureus, which is unable to carry out lipid modification of prelipoproteins. It was demonstrated that the mutant completely lacks palmitate-labeled lipoproteins and that its cells and crude lysate induce much less proinflammatory cytokines than the wild type. Bubeck et al. (14Bubeck J.W. Williams W.A. Missiakas D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13831-13836Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) also reported that an S. aureus variant that lacks lipoproteins is able to escape immune recognition and cause lethal infections. Furthermore, we showed that the activities of an LTA fraction derived from a Δlgt mutant are largely decreased when compared with those from the same fraction of the wild type (15Hashimoto M. Tawaratsumida K. Kariya H. Kiyohara A. Suda Y. Krikae F. Kirikae T. Götz F. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3162-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the lipoproteins in S. aureus appear to be the TLR2 ligand for the immune system. In the present study, we separated lipoproteins from S. aureus and elucidated the TLR2-activating structure. Bacterial Strain and Bacterial Components-S. aureus SA113, a restriction-deficient mutant of NCTC8325 (16Iordanescu S. Surdeanu M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1976; 96: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), was cultured in brain heart infusion broth (Eiken, Tokyo, Japan) at 37 °C for 6 h with constant shaking in a culture bag (CB20-1, Fujimori Kogyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) before being harvested by centrifugation (5,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C). The membrane fraction was prepared by bead disruption of the cells as described (13Stoll H. Dengjel J. Nerz C. Götz F. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The lipoprotein fraction was obtained by Triton X-114 phase partitioning of the membrane fraction as described (17Shibata K. Hasebe A. Sasaki T. Watanabe T. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1997; 19: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and was designated as Sa-M-TX. FSL-1, a synthetic diacylated lipopeptide, was purchased from EMC microcollections (Tübingen, Germany). Escherichia coli O55:B5 lipopolysaccharide (Sigma-Aldrich) was further purified by sodium deoxycholate reextraction as described (18Hirschfeld M. Ma Y Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). SAOUHSC_02699 di-O-palmitoyl (Pam2) lipopeptide 10-mer (Pam2CGNNSSKDKDG) and Pam2CSK4 were synthesized in our laboratory. The synthetic details will be described elsewhere. Separations of Proteins-Analytical SDS-PAGE was performed by the Tris-glycine method (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using a mini PAGE chamber AE-6530 and an AE-8450 power supply (Atto Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with a 12.5% gel. Proteinous materials were visualized by silver or Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, and visualization of acidic materials, such as LTA, was performed by Alcian blue staining. Proteins eluting between 25 and 40 kDa in the analytical SDS-PAGE were separated using a preparative electrophoresis apparatus, AE-6750 (Atto Corp.), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subjected to acetone precipitation to remove any contaminating SDS. The precipitates were dissolved in 20 mm octylglucoside. The concentration of lipoprotein was estimated by SDS-PAGE with silver staining and adjusted to 10 μg/ml. Monocyte Western Blotting-Monocyte Western blotting was carried out by the method described previously (20Wallis R.S. Amir-Tahmasseb M. Ellner J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3348-3352Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, stimuli were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the resolved stimuli in the gel were transblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane by the method of Towbin et al. (21Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) using an AE-6677 semidry blotting apparatus (Atto Corp.). The membrane of each lane was cut into 4-mm strips, and each strip was separately dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. The solution was poured into phosphate-buffered saline to precipitate stimuli-coated particles, which consist of stimuli and nitrocellulose. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline, the particle suspension in assay medium was applied to a luciferase assay using the Ba/mTLR2 cells described below. Mass Spectrometry-Mass spectra were obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) with an Axima QIT TOF mass spectrometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a nitrogen 337 nm laser. 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid was used as the matrix at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in aqueous 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were analyzed in positive and reflectron mode. Tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra were obtained using argon as a collision gas. Identification of Lipoproteins and Lipopeptides-The proteins that were separated by analytical SDS-PAGE were digested with trypsin as described previously (22Jensen O.N. Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 513-530PubMed Google Scholar). The peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS and identified by a data base (the National Center for Biotechnology Information nonredundant protein data base) search using the MASCOT software from Matrix Science (23Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6814) Google Scholar). The proteins were designated by the locus tags for the genome of S. aureus NCTC8325, which is the parent strain of SA113 (16Iordanescu S. Surdeanu M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1976; 96: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To isolate the N-terminal lipopeptide, the lipoprotein fraction was subjected to phase transfer surfactant-aided trypsin digestion (24Masuda T. Tomita M. Ishihama Y. J. Proteome Res. 2007; 7: 731-740Crossref Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The tryptic digest was subjected to HPLC using a normal phase Daisopak SP-120-5-SIL-P column (250 × 4.6 mm, DAISO, Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). The digests were eluted using a gradient program (solvent A, chloroform, methanol, water = 65/20/3, v/v/v; solvent B, chloroform, methanol, water = 65/40/3, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and were fractionated into 1-ml portions. The N-terminal lipopeptide was detected using a luciferase assay. The purified lipopeptide was characterized by MALDI-TOF-MS. Luciferase Assay-Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed p55IgκLuc, an NF-κB/DNA binding activity-dependent luciferase reporter construct (Ba/κB), murine TLR2 and the p55IgκLuc reporter construct (Ba/mTLR2), and murine TLR4/MD-2 and the p55IgκLuc reporter construct (Ba/mTLR4/mMD-2) were kindly provided by Prof. K. Miyake (Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan). The NF-κB-dependent luciferase activity in these cells was determined as described previously (12Hashimoto M. Tawaratsumida K. Kariya H. Aoyama A. Tamura T. Suda Y. Int. Immunol. 2006; 18: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cytokine Assay-Eight-week-old male BALB/c mice were obtained from Kyudo (Kumamoto, Japan). The animals received humane care in accordance with our institutional guidelines and the legal requirements of Japan. Stimulation of thioglycolate-elicited peripheral exudate cells and Histopaque-separated human peritoneal blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a healthy donor (M. F.) and a cytokine assay for secreted murine or human TNF-α were performed as described (15Hashimoto M. Tawaratsumida K. Kariya H. Kiyohara A. Suda Y. Krikae F. Kirikae T. Götz F. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3162-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Identification of Lipoproteins in S. aureus-The lipoprotein fraction was obtained from S. aureus cells using glass bead disruption followed by Triton X-114 phase partitioning. Four mg of the lipoprotein fraction (Sa-M-TX) were obtained from 10 liters of bacterial cell culture. Sa-M-TX activated murine TLR2 expressing cells (Ba/mTLR2) at 10 ng/ml but not murine TLR4 and MD-2 expressing Ba/mTLR4/mMD-2 cells or the negative control Ba/κB cells (Fig. 1A). The SDS-PAGE profile of Sa-M-TX showed that it contained Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB)-positive proteins and Alcian blue (AB)-positive components (Fig. 1B). The active molecules in Sa-M-TX were analyzed by monocyte Western blotting. TLR2-mediated NF-κB activation was strongly detected in a molecular mass range of 30–35 kDa (Fig. 1B). Thus, we subjected the Sa-M-TX proteins with molecular masses of around 30–35 kDa to in-gel tryptic digestion. At least seven lipoproteins, SAOUHSC_00634, -00844, -01002, -01180, -02554, -02650, and -02699, were identified by a combination of peptide mass fingerprinting and MS/MS spectra (Fig. 1C). Lipoprotein Immunological Activities-The lipoproteins were separated by preparative SDS-PAGE using a 12.5% gel. Among seven identified lipoproteins, we could separate three lipoproteins, SAOUHSC_02699, -02650, and -00634 (Fig. 2A). About 1 μg of each lipoprotein were obtained from 250 μg of Sa-M-TX. The TLR2-dependent activities of the lipoproteins were detected by NF-κB activation in TLR-expressing cells. All lipoproteins induced NF-κB activation in Ba/mTLR2 cells but not in Ba/mTLR4/mMD-2 or Ba/κB cells (Fig. 2B). The activities of the lipoproteins were observed at 0.1 ng/ml (Fig. 2C) and were about 100-fold higher than that of Sa-M-TX, which was shown in Fig. 1A. They also stimulated human PBMC and murine peritoneal exudate cells to induce TNF-α dose dependently (Fig. 2, D and E). The other four lipoproteins could not be analyzed because of the low content in Sa-M-TX. The N-terminal Structure of S. aureus Lipoprotein-Because the minimal active structure of bacterial lipoproteins is reported to be N-terminal acylated S-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cysteine-containing lipopeptide (25Hantke K. Braun V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), the N-terminal structure of S. aureus lipoprotein was investigated. We attempted to separate N-terminal lipopeptides from three separated lipoproteins by conventional tryptic digestion followed by reverse or normal phase HPLC separation. Although active components were eluted, no lipopeptides were detected by mass spectrometry. This may have been caused by insufficient digestion of the N-terminal moiety of the lipopeptides, probably because of poor solubility or micelle formation. Therefore, we used phase transfer surfactant-aided trypsin digestion (24Masuda T. Tomita M. Ishihama Y. J. Proteome Res. 2007; 7: 731-740Crossref Scopus (422) Google Scholar) to improve the efficiency of hydrophobic lipoprotein digestion. The lipoprotein SAOUHSC_02699 was thus able to be digested, and the digests were subjected to normal phase HPLC (Fig. 3A). A TLR2-activating component was found between fractions 17 and 18. The MALDI-TOF-MS spectra of the component showed a pseudomolecular ion [M+H]+ at m/z 1259.9. In the MS/MS spectra of the precursor ion at m/z 1259.9 (Fig. 3, B and C), C-terminal y ions were observed at m/z 606.0, 549.0, 435.0, and 321.0, which agreed with the N-terminal sequence of SAOUHSC_02699, GNNSSK. The ions at m/z 1026.7, 825.6, and 711.2 correspond to b ions of an S-(dipalmitoyloxypropyl)-cysteine-containing peptide. The ion at m/z 675.1 represents dehydroalanyl GNNSSK, which is formed by β-elimination of the 2,3-dipalmitoyloxypropylthio group. These results prove that the N-terminal structure of SAOUHSC_02699 is a diacyltype lipoprotein. The synthetic counterpart of its N-terminal lipopeptide 10-mer stimulated TLR2-dependent NF-κB activation in Ba/mTLR2 cells and TNF-α induction in PBMC (Fig. 4). The lipoprotein SAOUHSC_00634 and -02650 were also subjected to the phase transfer surfactant-aided trypsin digestion. Although active components were eluted from HPLC, no spectra corresponding to lipopeptide were obtained, suggesting that further improvement is required for complete digestion of some lipoproteins.FIGURE 4Immunological activities of a synthetic lipopeptide of SAOUHSC_ 02699. A, NF-κB activation induced by the indicated doses of lipopeptide in Ba/mTLR2 cells for 4 h was measured with a luciferase assay. The results are shown as relative luciferase activity, which was determined as the ratio of stimulated to nonstimulated activity. The data represent the mean ± S.E. obtained from three independent experiments. B, TNF-α production induced by the lipoprotein in human PBMC. The levels of TNF-α in the culture supernatants of the cells incubated with the indicated concentration of the stimuli for 4 h were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The data represent the mean ± S.E. obtained from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) S. aureus is known to activate TLR2, but the principal molecule responsible for this activity has not been proven. In this study, we identified several lipoproteins including SAOUHSC_ 01002, -01180, -02554, -00634, -02650, -00844, and -02699 as candidates of TLR2-activating molecules (Fig. 1C). Some of the lipoproteins were identified as quinol oxidase (SAOUHSC_01002), and the ATP-binding cassette transporter (SAOUHSC_02699, SAOUHSC_00634) and the others were classified as hypothetical proteins. SAOUHSC_00634 has been previously reported as SitC, which acts as an iron-regulated ATP-binding cassette transporter in S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and is a major lipoprotein that is distributed throughout the cell wall (26Cockayne A. Hill J.P. Powell N.B. Bishop K. Sims C. Williams P. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3767-3774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SAOUHSC_00634 and -01180 were also identified in the membrane fraction of S. aureus (13Stoll H. Dengjel J. Nerz C. Götz F. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Although some of lipoproteins reported (13Stoll H. Dengjel J. Nerz C. Götz F. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) were not identified in our study, probably because of differences in the culture conditions, similar lipoproteins were extracted. Thus, we consider lipoproteins to be constitutively expressed in S. aureus. SAOUHSC_02699, -02650, and -00634, which were separated by preparative SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A), activate TLR2-expressing cells (Ba/mTLR2) but not murine TLR4- and MD-2-expressing Ba/mTLR4/mMD-2 cells or the negative control Ba/κB cells (Fig. 2B). They also exert strong TNF-α-inducing activity on murine and human immune cells (Fig. 2, D and E). These data indicate that the lipoproteins are the TLR2-activating ligands in S. aureus. Sa-M-TX contained LTA, which was visualized in the range of 15–23 kDa (Fig. 1B), whereas the activity of Sa-M-TX was observed in the range of 30–35 kDa (Fig. 1B). We have previously reported that the LTA fraction derived from an S. aureus lipoprotein knock-out mutant is 100-fold less potent than that of the wild-type (15Hashimoto M. Tawaratsumida K. Kariya H. Kiyohara A. Suda Y. Krikae F. Kirikae T. Götz F. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3162-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Although the LTA is still thought to be a TLR2-activating molecule (27Schröder N.W. Morath S. Alexander C. Hamann L. Hartung T. Zähringer U. Göbel B.U. Webe Jr., R. Schumann R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15587-15594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), the principal molecules responsible for the TLR2 activity of Sa-M-TX are concluded to be lipoproteins. Because the three lipoproteins separated were predominant constituents in Sa-M-TX and the sum of their activities is comparable with that of Sa-M-TX (Figs. 1A and 2B), they are responsible for most of the activity in Sa-M-TX. As for the TLR2-mediated recognition of whole S. aureus, it should include other lipoproteins, which depend on the condition of bacteria. Characterization of lipoproteins expressed in a pathogenic condition is important for the analysis of virulence factors by S. aureus in infectious diseases. In the case of Gram-negative bacteria and mycoplasma, several lipoproteins have been identified as TLR2 ligands, and their N-terminal lipopeptides, which contain diacylated or triacylated S-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cystein, have been proven to be essential moieties for TLR2 activity using chemically synthesized compounds. Lipoproteins derived from Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, Borrelia burgdorferi, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, have been proven to be triacylated lipoproteins (28Hirschfeld M.

Mycoplasma, such as Mycoplasma fermentans and Mycoplasma salivarium, have been shown to possess diacylated lipoproteins (32Mühlradt P.F. Kiess M. Meyer H. Süssmuth R. Jung G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 33Shibata K Hasebe A. Into T. Yamada M. Watanabe T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6538-6544Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether the lipoproteins in Gram-positive bacteria are diacylated or triacylated. In this study, we identified the N-terminal structure of S. aureus lipoprotein SAOUHSC_ 02699 as diacylated lipoproteins (Fig. 3). We also confirmed its activity using a synthetic counterpart (Fig. 4). In several bacteria, but not all, the N terminus of the diacylglyceryl-modified cysteine residue is fatty-acylated by a lipoprotein N-acyltransferase (lnt) (34Sankaran K. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19701-19706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stoll et al. (13Stoll H. Dengjel J. Nerz C. Götz F. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) screened the published genome sequences of S. aureus strains for a gene encoding an lnt homolog and found no such protein. These data correspond to our data that the lipoproteins in S. aureus are diacylated. Kurokawa et al. (35Kurokawa K. Lee H. Roh K-B. Asanuma M. Kim Y.S. Nakayama H. Shiratsuchi A. Choi Y. Takeuchi O. Kang H.J. Dohmae N. Nakanishi Y. Akira S. Sekimizu K. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. January 12, 2009; 10.1074/jbc.M809618200Google Scholar) recently reported that N terminus of S. aureus SitC lipoprotein is triacylated. They also suggested the existence of another type of N-acyltransferase distinct from lnt. Although the results did not agree with our analytical data, it is possible to consider that strain variation or cultural condition may affect the activity of the suggested enzyme. Further analysis must be necessary. In conclusion, we identified TLR2-activating lipoproteins from S. aureus cells and characterized the N-terminal lipopeptide structure of a lipoprotein SAUOHSC_02699 as a diacylated one. Because these lipoproteins are considered to contribute to the virulence of S. aureus, further studies using protein expression or organic synthetic chemistry are now ongoing to clarify their immunobiological properties.

We hypothesized that the SNP is associated with morbidity and mortality through the effect on fatness.In a population of 362,200 Danish young men, examined for military service between 1943 and 1977, all obese (BMI>or=31.0 kg/m(2)) and a random 1% sample of the others were identified. In 1992-94, at an average age of 46 years, 752 of the obese and 876 of the others were re-examined, including measurements of weight, fat mass, height, and waist circumference, and DNA sampling. Hospitalization and death occurring during the following median 13.5 years were ascertained by linkage to national registers. Cox regression analyses were performed using a dominant effect model (TT vs. TA or AA). In total 205 men died. Mortality was 42% lower (p = 0.001) with the TT genotype than in A-allele carriers. This phenomenon was observed in both the obese and the randomly sampled cohort when analysed separately. Adjustment for fatness covariates attenuated the association only slightly. Exploratory analyses of cause-specific mortality and morbidity prior to death suggested a general protective effect of the TT genotype, whereas there were only weak associations with disease incidence, except for diseases of the nervous system.Independent of fatness, the A-allele of the FTO SNP appears to increase mortality of a magnitude similar to smoking, but without a particular underlying disease pattern barring an increase in the risk of diseases of the nervous system."

Treatment with these agonists leads to increased apoE expression and triglyceride accumulation in adipocytes. The importance of apoE for adipocyte triglyceride accumulation is demonstrated by observations that triglyceride accumulation is impaired in apoE knockout adipocytes treated with PPARγ agonists. The current studies investigate the molecular mechanism for PPARγ stimulation of the adipocyte apoE gene and demonstrate that the liver receptor X (LXR) response element within an apoE gene downstream enhancer is required for the apoE response to PPARγ agonists. The response of the apoE gene to treatment with PPARγ agonists was delayed beyond 12 h suggesting the involvement of an intermediary pathway. The combined addition of PPARγ and LXR agonists did not increase apoE response beyond that observed with addition of either alone. Deletion or mutation of the LXR response element completely eliminated the adipocyte apoE gene response to a PPARγ agonist. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses performed using isolated adipocytes, or adipose tissue from mice treated with PPARγ agonists, showed increased LXR binding to the apoE gene after PPARγ agonist treatment. Knockdown of LXR expression completely eliminated the increase in apoE message, protein, and triglyceride in response to PPARγ stimulation. The LXR response element has been previously shown to mediate sterol responsiveness of the apoE gene, and apoE expression plays an important role in adipocyte triglyceride balance. The current observations suggest that the PPARγ-LXR-apoE regulatory cascade could be an important molecular link for cross-talk between adipocyte triglyceride and cholesterol homeostasis.

Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2008; 77: 289-312Google Scholar). These include genes involved in TGD and fatty acid metabolism and in the expression of adipokines. Adipocyte lipid metabolism and the secretion of adipokines have a powerful effect on systemic substrate utilization and on overall organismal energy metabolism (2Scherer P.E. Diabetes.. 2006; 55: 1537-1545Google Scholar, 3Fantuzzi G. Mazzone T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol... 2007; 27: 996-1003Google Scholar). TZD drugs, currently in clinical use for treatment of human diabetes, are established ligands of adipocyte PPARγ receptors, and we have previously shown that adipocyte apoE expression is responsive to treatment with these drugs (4Yue L. Rassouli N. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. Mazzone T. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 47626-47632Google Scholar). Zechner and colleagues first described expression of apoE by adipocytes in 1991 (5Zechner R. Moser R. Newman T.C. Fried S.K. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 10583-10588Google Scholar), but only recently has additional information been provided regarding regulation and function of adipocyte apoE (6Huang Z.H. Reardon C.A. Mazzone T. Diabetes.. 2006; 55: 3394-3402Google Scholar, 7Yue L. Christman J.W. Mazzone T. Endocrinology.. 2008; 149: 4051-4058Google Scholar, 8Espiritu D.J. Mazzone T.

Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. Mazzone T. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 47626-47632Google Scholar, 6Huang Z.H. Reardon C.A. Mazzone T. Diabetes.. 2006; 55: 3394-3402Google Scholar). The pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-α, reduces adipocyte apoE expression, an effect mediated by the NF-κB transcriptional complex binding an element in the apoE gene proximal promoter (4Yue L. Rassouli N. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. Mazzone T. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 47626-47632Google Scholar, 7Yue L. Christman J.W. Mazzone T. Endocrinology.. 2008; 149: 4051-4058Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species produced by the stromovascular fraction of adipose tissue harvested from obese mice also reduce adipocyte apoE expression via the NF-κB pathway (8Espiritu D.J. Mazzone T. Diabetes.. 2008; 57: 2992-2998Google Scholar). With respect to apoE function, adipocytes from EKO mice are smaller than adipocytes from WT mice, and cultured EKO adipocytes and adipose tissue accumulate less TG compared with WT cells after incubation with apoE-containing lipoproteins (6Huang Z.H. Reardon C.A. Mazzone T. Diabetes.. 2006; 55: 3394-3402Google Scholar). This defect in TG accumulation can be corrected by the adenoviral expression of apoE in EKO adipocytes. Furthermore, in EKO adipocytes, TG accumulation in response to treatment with PPARγ agonists is impaired compared with WT adipocytes (6Huang Z.H. Reardon C.A. Mazzone T. Diabetes.. 2006; 55: 3394-3402Google Scholar). All of these observations support a role for apoE in adipocyte TG metabolism. Such a role for apoE is different than what has been described for other cell types, for example macrophages, in which apoE has been shown to primarily play a role in cellular sterol metabolism (11Mazzone T. Reardon C. J. Lipid Res... 1994; 35: 1345-1353Google Scholar, 12Lin C.-Y. Duan H. Mazzone T. J. Lipid Res... 1999; 40: 1618-1626Google Scholar). Its role in these cells includes modulating sterol efflux and/or the subcellular distribution of sterol. Consistent with its role in cellular sterol metabolism, the apoE gene is strongly regulated by cellular sterol content acting via the sterol-sensing LXR pathway and LXR response elements present in two duplicated downstream apoE gene enhancers, ME.1 and ME.2 (13Laffitte B.A. Repa J.J. Joseph S.B. Wilpitz D.C. Kas H.R. Mangeldorf D.J. Tontonoz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2001; 98: 507-512Google Scholar).In previous studies, we established that the response of the apoE gene to PPARγ agonists was not mediated by the apoE proximal promoter but required the presence of at least one of these two apoE downstream gene enhancers (4Yue L. Rassouli N. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. Mazzone T. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 47626-47632Google Scholar). Based on the requirement for a downstream enhancer, the presence of an LXRE in the enhancer, the absence of a clearly identifiable PPRE within this enhancer, and the recently established positive effect of PPARγ agonists on LXR gene transcription (14Chawla A. Boisvert W.A. Lee C.H. Laffitte B.A. Barak Y. Joseph S.B. Liao D. Nagy L. Edwards P.A. Curtiss L.K. Evans R.M. Tontonoz P. Mol. Cell.. 2001; 7: 161-171Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the response of the adipocyte apoE gene to PPARγ agonists could be mediated by the LXR pathway (4Yue L. Rassouli N. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. Mazzone T. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 47626-47632Google Scholar). Based on similar considerations, a role for the LXR pathway has been posited as mediating the effect of PPARγ agonists on ABCA1 expression in macrophages (14Chawla A. Boisvert W.A. Lee C.H. Laffitte B.A. Barak Y. Joseph S.B. Liao D. Nagy L. Edwards P.A. Curtiss L.K. Evans R.M. Tontonoz P. Mol. Cell.. 2001; 7: 161-171Google Scholar). Because of observations supporting a role for apoE in adipocyte TG metabolism, the involvement of the LXR pathway for mediating the PPARγ response of the adipocyte apoE gene could provide an important nexus of cross-talk between adipocyte TG and sterol metabolism. The studies reported in this manuscript examine the molecular mechanism for PPARγ stimulation of adipocyte apoE gene transcription and establish an important role for the LXR pathway for mediating this response.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Cell culture media, supplements, and antibiotics were purchased from Invitrogen. Insulin, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, dexamethasone, GW3965, and 22-OHch were obtained from Sigma. Ciglitazone and rosiglitazone were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Pioglitazone was obtained from Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Antibodies to LXRα/β were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.Animals—Eight-week-old C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Mice were housed in a temperature-controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle and were given free access to standard chow and water for 10 days. Pioglitazone (25 mg/kg/day) mixed with chow or the control chow diet was fed for an additional 5 days before mice were sacrificed for isolation of adipose tissue. Intra-abdominal white adipose tissue was collected in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. For real-time PCR quantitation of apoE mRNA abundance, total RNA was extracted for synthesis of first-strand cDNA. For the in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, adipose tissue was prepared according to the EpiQuik™ tissue chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (Epigentek, Brooklyn, NY).Cell Culture—3T3-L1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained for passage in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at <70% confluence. For experiments, differentiation was induced at 2 days post confluence by incubation for 3 days in culture medium containing 0.25 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine, and 10 μg/ml insulin. This was followed by 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 μg/ml insulin that was renewed every 2 or 3 days. Experiments were performed on post differentiation days 8–10. Triglyceride content of cells was measured using a kit from Wako Chemicals as previously described (6Huang Z.H. Reardon C.A. Mazzone T. Diabetes.. 2006; 55: 3394-3402Google Scholar).Real-time RT-PCR and Immunoblot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cells or tissues after the treatments described in figure legends. Each sample of first strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using a Thermo-Script™ RT-PCR system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). cDNA (1.5 μl) was amplified by real-time PCR using a TaqSYBR green supermix with ROX (Bio-Rad). Normalization for loading was accomplished by assessing β-actin message abundance. Individual samples were analyzed in triplicate using an Mx3000P quantitative PCR system (Stratagene). Levels for RNA are reported as -fold change compared with control using the comparative quantitation analysis software available on the Mx3000P. Product purity for PCR reactions was confirmed by examination melting curves for the presence of a single peak. Immunoblots on cells or tissues were performed, and the results were quantitated as previously described (7Yue L. Christman J.W. Mazzone T. Endocrinology.. 2008; 149: 4051-4058Google Scholar).Site-directed Mutagenesis—The human apoE promoter fragment –503/+86 alone or with the human apoE ME2 downstream enhancer (7Yue L. Christman J.W. Mazzone T. Endocrinology.. 2008; 149: 4051-4058Google Scholar, 13Laffitte B.A. Repa J.J. Joseph S.B. Wilpitz D.C. Kas H.R. Mangeldorf D.J. Tontonoz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2001; 98: 507-512Google Scholar) were cloned into pGL3 luciferase vector as previously described to give rise to pGL503 or pGL503en, respectively. Site-directed deletion or mutation was performed using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primer with deleted nucleotides (indicated by the dashed line) was: 5′-GGA CAC CCT CCC CAT CAG CTG CCA————–AAG GCA GCT GGT GGG GAA GGC ATT GG-3′. The primer with mutated nucleotides (as indicated in small cap letters) was: 5′-CCC CAT CAG CTG CCA Gaa TCA CTG GCa aTC AAA GGC AGC TGG TG-3′. These primers and their complementary sequences were used to disrupt the LXR response element in ME2. All deletions and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Transient Transfection and Luciferase Activity Assay—Transient transfection of luciferase reporter plasmids was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer in the 12-well plate format. Luciferase assays were performed using the luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Following the treatments described in the figure legends, cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 120 μl of cell culture lysis reagent provided in the luciferase assay kit. 10 μl of the cell lysate was mixed with 50 μl of luciferase assay solution, and luminescence was determined using a Turner Design Luminometer. All experiments were performed in triplicate and normalized to the activity produced by a cotransfected β-galactosidase expression vector. For RNA interference, differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were trypsinized and plated in fresh growth medium (3 × 105 per ml) and transferred into 12-well plates at 1 ml per well. In each well, 100 pm of a mixture of siRNA targeted to LXRα and LXRβ (L-040649-01-0005, Mouse NR1H3, NM_013839 and L-042839-00-0005, Mouse NR1H2, NM_009473, respectively) complexed with 2 ml of Lipofectamine was added. A non-targeting siRNA provided by the manufacturer was used as a control.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated as described in the figure legends. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out using the ChIP-IT Express kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions as previously described (7Yue L. Christman J.W. Mazzone T. Endocrinology.. 2008; 149: 4051-4058Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were fixed, and the isolated nuclear fraction was digested for 13 min at 37 °C by an enzymatic shearing mixture. The digestate was visualized on an agarose gel to ensure shearing efficiency resulted in DNA fragments ranging from 200 to 500 bp. After centrifugation, 10 μl of the supernatant containing sheared chromatin was used as the assay input. The sheared chromatin/ protein was immunoprecipitated using an anti-LXRα/β antibody (sc-13068, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. After immunoprecipitation, samples were centrifuged, washed, and reverse cross-linked prior to being treated with ribonuclease A and proteinase K. The DNA was purified with DNA mini columns provided with the kit, and real-time PCR was performed with primers (A 5′-AAC TGA CAC GTG GGT TGC AGG GGC AAC A-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-CAA CAT CCT TTC TCT CAG GCT AGA GTC C-3′), designed to amplify a 152-bp portion of the apoE enhancer containing the LXRE. As an internal control, an RNA polymerase II antibody (sc-899, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to immunoprecipitate the mouse GAPDH promoter.The in vivo ChIP was performed with freshly isolated adipose tissue using the EpiQuik™ tissue ChIP kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. 400 mg of adipose tissue in 2 ml of homogenizing buffer was homogenized using 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was re-suspended in 1 ml of CP3 buffer (included with the kit) with protease inhibitors. The DNA was sheared by sonication with 10 pulses of 15 s each at 25% Power using a Vibracell 3-mm microtip probe with 40-s incubation on ice between each pulse. The sheared DNA was used for immunoprecipitation as described above.Statistical Analysis—All the data are presented at means ± S.D. values. Statistical differences were evaluated using analysis of variance (SPSS, Chicago, IL). p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSFig. 1 presents the results of detailed dose response and time course analyses for the response of apoE gene to treatment with rosiglitazone. The dose-related increase with rosiglitazone establishes the apoE response after treatment of adipocytes with three different PPARγ agonists, rosiglitazone (Fig. 1A), ciglitazone, and pioglitazone (4Yue L. Rassouli N. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. Mazzone T. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 47626-47632Google Scholar, 6Huang Z.H. Reardon C.A. Mazzone T. Diabetes.. 2006; 55: 3394-3402Google Scholar). The time course for the response of the apoE gene to treatment with rosiglitazone (Fig. 1B) demonstrates that the first measurable increase in apoE mRNA levels after addition of rosiglitazone is not detected until after 12 h. This somewhat prolonged lag time for the apoE gene response is consistent with the hypothesis that the apoE gene does not respond directly to PPARγ agonists and that the response requires involvement of an intermediary pathway. Based on considerations presented in the introduction, we focused on a potential intermediary role for the LXR pathway. The LXR gene has been shown to be a target of PPARγ agonists (14Chawla A. Boisvert W.A. Lee C.H. Laffitte B.A. Barak Y. Joseph S.B. Liao D. Nagy L. Edwards P.A. Curtiss L.K. Evans R.M. Tontonoz P. Mol. Cell.. 2001; 7: 161-171Google Scholar, 15Juvet L.K. Andresen S.M.

Endocrinol... 2008; 17: 172-182Google Scholar), and we examined the response of LXR protein levels in our model system. Fig. 1 (C and D) shows that treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with rosiglitazone increased total cellular (C) and nuclear (D) LXR protein abundance.We next measured the response of the adipocyte apoE gene, and of an apoE gene reporter construct, to incubation with an LXR agonist, a PPARγ agonist, or a combination of these (Fig. 2). The addition of 22-OHch (an oxysterol LXR agonist) alone, or ciglitazone alone, led to a 2- to 3-fold increase in the expression of the adipocyte apoE gene and of a reporter construct containing 503 bp of the proximal apoE gene promoter and the apoE gene enhancer ME2 (Fig. 2, A and B). Addition of the agents together, however, did not produce a greater increase in apoE or reporter gene response compared with either agent alone. The reporter construct without ME2 did not respond to either 22-OHch or ciglitazone. An experiment similar to that shown in Fig. 2A, but conducted with the alternate agonists, rosiglitazone and GW3965, gave similar results. Either agent alone significantly stimulated apoE mRNA abundance, but the effect of the agents together was not additive. The absence of an additive response to the combined addition of PPARγ and LXR agonists provided further support for the hypothesis that these agonists act via a common pathway to stimulate adipocyte apoE gene expression.FIGURE 2Activation of the adipocyte apoE gene by PPARγ and LXR ligands is not additive. A, 3T3-L1 cells were treated with ethanol vehicle, 10 μm 22-OHch, 20 μm ciglitazone (Cig), or a combination of these for 48 h before harvest to measure apoE mRNA level. B, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected with the indicated apoE reporter gene constructs and treated as described in A. Luciferase activity was measured as described under ""Experimental Procedures."" C, cells were treated with 10 μm rosiglitazone or 1 μm GW3965 for 48 h and harvested as described in A. *, p < 0.005 for comparison to untreated control cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The quantitatively similar response of the endogenous apoE gene and the pGL503en reporter construct to ciglitazone in Fig. 2 indicated that the important gene elements required for increased apoE gene expression in response to PPARγ agonists were contained within this reporter construct. Using the results in Figs. 1 and 2 as a foundation, we designed experiments to more definitively examine the role of the LXR pathway in mediating the PPARγ response of the apoE gene by (a) evaluating the need for the apoE gene LXRE, (b) measuring the recruitment of LXR to the apoE gene in response to PPARγ agonist stimulation in vitro and in vivo, and (c) evaluating the effect of silencing LXR protein expression. Fig. 3 (A and B) provides the details of the four reporter gene constructs used to examine the importance of the apoE gene LXRE. These constructs include a proximal apoE gene promoter construct without the ME2 downstream enhancer, the proximal promoter construct with ME2, the enhancer construct in which the LXR response element is deleted, and the enhancer construct in which the LXR element is mutated. The specific nucleotides deleted or mutated are shown in Fig. 3B. Fig. 3C shows that the promoter construct without ME2 failed to respond to ciglitazone, whereas the promoter construct containing ME2 responded with an approximate 3-fold increase to treatment with ciglitazone. Deletion of the LXR response element within ME2 completely eliminated the response to ciglitazone. Fig. 3D shows that the pGL503en construct responded with 2- to 3-fold increased expression after treatment with 22-OHch or ciglitazone. Mutation of four nucleotides within the LXR element, however, completely eliminated the reporter gene response to both agonists.FIGURE 3Stimulation of an apoE gene reporter construct by ciglitazone (Cig) requires an intact LXRE. A, the reporter constructs used to evaluate apoE gene elements responsive to PPARγ agonists are shown. The numbers on each side of the solid bars indicate the position in base pairs relative to transcription initiation site. The solid bars represent exon-1 of the apoE gene.

Fig. 4A shows that treatment of intact adipocytes with ciglitazone or 22-OHch increased LXR binding to the apoE gene. A representative agarose gel shows the binding of RNA polymerase II to the GAPDH gene (as an internal control) and the binding of LXR to the apoE gene in response to treatment of adipocytes with 22-OHch or ciglitazone. The bar figure represents PCR quantitation of three separate ChIP analyses, all corrected for the internal GAPDH control, and shows a 4-fold increase in LXR binding to the apoE gene after treatment of adipocytes with ciglitazone. Fig. 4B shows a similar result from an identical experiment using a different PPARγ agonist, rosiglitazone. For Fig. 5, mice were treated for 5 days with pioglitazone at 25 mg/kg/day. At the end of that time, freshly isolated adipose tissue demonstrated a 3-fold increase in apoE mRNA abundance (Fig. 5A). ChIP analysis using freshly isolated adipose tissue demonstrated significantly more LXR protein binding (3.7-fold) at the apoE gene enhancer element.FIGURE 4ChIP analysis of LXR binding to the apoE gene in response to the treatment with PPARγ ligands. 3T3-L1 cells were treated with 10 μg 22-OHch or ciglitazone (Cig)(A) or rosiglitazone (Rosi)(B) for 48 h and then harvested for ChIP analysis as described under ""Experimental Procedures."" After immunoprecipitation, a 152-bp amplicon of the apoE enhancer containing the LXRE was amplified by PCR. The amount of LXR bound to the LXR enhancer was assessed using real-time PCR to quantitate immunoisolated DNA.

We next performed experiments to further confirm that an intact adipocyte LXR pathway was required for the response of the endogenous adipocyte apoE gene to PPARγ stimulation. Cells were transfected with an siRNA for LXR, or a control siRNA, and after 24 h they were treated with PPARγ agonists as indicated (Fig. 6). The results in Fig. 6 (A and B) show that treatment with a combined LXRα/LXRβ siRNA leads to a 65–80% reduction in LXRα (A) or LXRβ (B) mRNA in unstimulated adipocytes. Further, treatment with the LXR siRNA completely eliminated the response to ciglitazone that is easily observed in cells treated with a control siRNA. For Fig. 6C, cells were harvested for immunoblot analysis using an antibody to LXR that recognizes both LXRα and LXRβ protein. LXR protein abundance is significantly reduced by the LXR siRNA. Fig. 6D shows that treatment of adipocytes with LXR siRNA completely eliminated the increase in apoE mRNA levels in response to rosiglitazone treatment. Silencing LXR also completely prevented the PPARγ-mediated increase in apoE protein (Fig. 6E). We have previously shown that the TG accumulation that follows PPARγ agonist treatment of adipocytes is dependent on the expression of adipocyte apoE (6Huang Z.H. Reardon C.A. Mazzone T. Diabetes.. 2006; 55: 3394-3402Google Scholar). This latter observation, along with the results in Fig. 6E, supports the prediction that silencing LXR would prevent the PPARγ-mediated increase i"

Parkin activates the clearance of the unfolded receptor, while the overexpression of GPR37, in the absence of parkin, can lead to unfolded protein-induced cell death. We found that overexpression of the human GPR37 receptor in HEK293 cells and consequent activation of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response had effects comparable to starvation, in inducing the cellular autophagic pathway. Treatment with specific modulators provided further evidence for the autophagic clearance of the overexpressed GPR37 protein, in detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions, as confirmed by the conversion of the microtubule-associated protein 1, light chain 3 (LC3)-I marker to its LC3-II isoform. Furthermore, Gpr37-null mutant mice displayed consistent alterations of ER stress and autophagic pathway markers in brain tissue samples. These findings show that GPR37 overexpression per se can induce cellular autophagy, which may prevent the selective degeneration of GPR37-expressing neurons, as reported for Parkinson's and related neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1966795940,"Immunization with radiation attenuated Plasmodium sporozoites (RAS) elicits sterile protective immunity against sporozoite challenge in murine models and in humans. Similarly to RAS, the genetically attenuated sporozoites (GAPs) named uis3(-), uis4(-) and P36p(-) have arrested growth during the liver stage development, and generate a powerful protective immune response in mice. We compared the protective mechanisms in P. yoelii RAS, uis3(-) and uis4(-) in BALB/c mice. In RAS and GAPs, sterile immunity is only achieved after one or more booster injections. There were no differences in the immune responses to the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) generated by RAS and GAPs. To evaluate the role of non-CSP T-cell antigens we immunized antibody deficient, CSP-transgenic BALB/c mice, that are T cell tolerant to CSP, with P. yoelii RAS or with uis3(-) or uis4(-) GAPs, and challenged them with wild type sporozoites. In every instance the parasite liver stage burden was approximately 3 logs higher in antibody deficient CSP transgenic mice as compared to antibody deficient mice alone. We conclude that CSP is a powerful protective antigen in both RAS and GAPs viz., uis3(-) and uis4(-) and that the protective mechanisms are similar independently of the method of sporozoite attenuation."
https://openalex.org/W2050097253,"Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a common psychiatric illness with a complex mode of inheritance. Besides traditional linkage and association studies, which require large sample sizes, analysis of common and rare chromosomal copy number variants (CNVs) in extended families may provide novel insights into the genetic susceptibility of complex disorders. Using the Illumina HumanHap550 BeadChip with over 550,000 SNP markers, we genotyped 46 individuals in a three-generation Old Order Amish pedigree with 19 affected (16 BPD and three major depression) and 27 unaffected subjects. Using the PennCNV algorithm, we identified 50 CNV regions that ranged in size from 12 to 885 kb and encompassed at least 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Of 19 well characterized CNV regions that were available for combined genotype-expression analysis 11 (58%) were associated with expression changes of genes within, partially within or near these CNV regions in fibroblasts or lymphoblastoid cell lines at a nominal P value <0.05. To further investigate the mode of inheritance of CNVs in the large pedigree, we analyzed a set of four CNVs, located at 6q27, 9q21.11, 12p13.31 and 15q11, all of which were enriched in subjects with affective disorders. We additionally show that these variants affect the expression of neuronal genes within or near the rearrangement. Our analysis suggests that family based studies of the combined effect of common and rare CNVs at many loci may represent a useful approach in the genetic analysis of disease susceptibility of mental disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2065251992,"Aldo-ketoreductase 1C (AKR1C) enzymes catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of ketosteroids to hydroxysteroids. They are Phase I metabolizing enzymes for natural and synthetic steroid hormones. They convert 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (Dht, potent androgen) to 3alpha/beta-androstanediols (inactive androgens) and the prodrug tibolone (Tib) to estrogenic 3alpha/beta-hydroxytibolones. Herein we demonstrate for the first time that human AKR1C enzymes (AKR1C1-4) are able to reduce conjugated steroids such as Dht-17beta-glucuronide (DhtG), Dht-17beta-sulfate (DhtS), and Tib-17beta-sulfate (TibS). Product identities were characterized by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and kinetic parameters of the reactions were determined. The product profile of the reduction of each steroid conjugate by the individual AKR1C isoform was similar to that of the corresponding free steroid except for the reduction of DhtG catalyzed by AKR1C2, where a complete inversion in stereochemical preference to 3beta-reduction (with DhtG) from 3alpha-reduction (with Dht and DhtS) was observed. The catalytic efficiency of 3-keto reduction was modestly affected by the presence of a 17-sulfate group but severely impaired by the presence of a 17-glucuronide group for AKR1C1-3 isoforms. AKR1C4, however, showed superior catalytic efficiencies versus the other isoforms, and those were unaffected by steroid conjugation. Our findings provide evidence for alternative pathways of steroid metabolism where the phase I reaction (reduction) occurs after the phase II reaction (conjugation). Specifically, it is indicated that Dht is metabolized to its metabolite 3alpha-androstanediol-17-glucuronide via the previously unrecognized ""conjugation pathway"" involving the sequential reactions of UGT2B17 and AKR1C4 in liver but via the conventional ""reduction pathway"" involving the sequential reactions of AKR1C2 and UGT2B15/17 in prostate."
https://openalex.org/W1973722684,"Integrated cascades of protein tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation play essential roles in transducing signals in response to growth factors and cytokines. How adaptor or scaffold proteins assemble signaling complexes through both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/threonine residues to regulate specific signaling pathways and biological responses is unclear. We show in multiple cell types that endogenous 14-3-3ζ is phosphorylated on Tyr179 in response to granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Importantly, 14-3-3ζ can function as an intermolecular bridge that couples to phosphoserine residues and also directly binds the SH2 domain of Shc via Tyr179. The assembly of these 14-3-3:Shc scaffolds is specifically required for the recruitment of a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling complex and the regulation of CTL-EN cell survival in response to cytokine. The biological significance of these findings was further demonstrated using primary bone marrow-derived mast cells from 14-3-3ζ-/- mice. We show that cytokine was able to promote Akt phosphorylation and viability of primary mast cells derived from 14-3-3ζ-/- mice when reconstituted with wild type 14-3-3ζ, but the Akt phosphorylation and survival response was reduced in cells reconstituted with the Y179F mutant. Together, these results show that 14-3-3:Shc scaffolds can act as multivalent signaling nodes for the integration of both phosphoserine/threonine and phosphotyrosine pathways to regulate specific cellular responses."
https://openalex.org/W2038358516,"Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is a major gene expression regulatory mechanism in metazoan organisms. Proteins that bind pre-mRNA elements and control assembly of splicing complexes regulate utilization of pre-mRNA alternative splice sites. To understand how signaling pathways impact this mechanism, an RNA interference screen in Drosophila S2 cells was used to identify proteins that regulate TAF1 (TBP-associated factor 1) alternative splicing in response to activation of the ATR (ATM-RAD3-related) signaling pathway by the chemotherapeutic drug camptothecin (CPT). The screen identified 15 proteins that, when knocked down, caused the same change in TAF1 alternative splicing as CPT treatment. However, combined RNA interference and CPT treatment experiments indicated that only a subset of the identified proteins are targets of the CPT-induced signal, suggesting that multiple independent pathways regulate TAF1 alternative splicing. To understand how signals modulate the function of splicing factors, we characterized one of the CPT targets, Tra2 (Transformer-2). CPT was found to down-regulate Tra2 protein levels. CPT-induced Tra2 down-regulation was ATR-dependent and temporally paralleled the change in TAF1 alternative splicing, supporting the conclusion that Tra2 directly regulates TAF1 alternative splicing. Additionally, CPT-induced Tra2 down-regulation occurred independently of new protein synthesis, suggesting a post-translational mechanism. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 reduced CPT-induced Tra2 degradation and TAF1 alternative splicing, and mutation of evolutionarily conserved Tra2 lysine 81, a potential ubiquitin conjugation site, to arginine inhibited CPT-induced Tra2 degradation, supporting a proteasome-dependent alternative splicing mechanism. We conclude that CPT-induced TAF1 alternative splicing occurs through ATR-signaled degradation of a subset of splicing-regulatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1966371129,"Microcircuits in different brain areas share similar architectural and biophysical properties with compact motor networks known as central pattern generators (CPGs). Consequently, CPGs have been suggested as valuable biological models for understanding of microcircuit dynamics and particularly, their synchronization. We use a well known compact motor network, the lobster pyloric CPG to study principles of intercircuit synchronization. We couple separate pyloric circuits obtained from two animals via artificial synapses and observe how their synchronization depends on the topology and kinetic parameters of the computer-generated synapses. Stable in-phase synchronization appears when electrically coupling the pacemaker groups of the two networks, but reciprocal inhibitory connections produce more robust and regular cooperative activity. Contralateral inhibitory connections offer effective synchronization and flexible setting of the burst phases of the interacting networks. We also show that a conductance-based mathematical model of the coupled circuits correctly reproduces the observed dynamics illustrating the generality of the phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W2032503093,"Drosophila sensory organ precursor cells (SOPs) divide asymmetrically along the anterior-posterior (a-p) body axis to generate two different daughter cells. Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) regulates the a-p orientation of the SOP division. The localization of the PCP proteins Van Gogh (Vang) and Frizzled (Fz) define anterior and posterior apical membrane domains prior to SOP division. Here, we investigate the relative contributions of Vang, Fz and Dishevelled (Dsh), a membrane-associated protein acting downstream of Fz, in orienting SOP polarity. Genetic and live imaging analyses suggest that Dsh restricts the localization of a centrosome-attracting activity to the anterior cortex and that Vang is a target of Dsh in this process. Using a clone border assay, we provide evidence that the Vang and fz genes act redundantly in SOPs to orient its polarity axis in response to extrinsic local PCP cues. Additionally, we find that the activity of Vang is dispensable for the non-autonomous polarizing activity of fz. These observations indicate that both Vang and Fz act as cues for downstream effectors orienting the planar polarity axis of dividing SOPs."

Wienands J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 453-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Tyrosine residues in the ITAM are phosphorylated by Src family kinases, such as Lyn, and serve as a docking site for Syk, a pivotal tyrosine kinase for this signaling. The ITAM-bound Syk becomes activated and phosphorylates and activates key signaling proteins, such as another tyrosine kinase Btk, phospholipase C (PLC) γ2, and the adaptor protein BLNK (3Kurosaki T.

The earliest report demonstrated that, after BCR cross-linking, Ras is co-localized with the aggregates of BCR (patches), and then with the cap, an assembly of patches at one pole of the cell (21Graziadei L. Riabowol K. Bar-Sagi D. Nature. 1990; 347: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Then followed reports indicating rapid activation of Ras upon BCR cross-linking (22Lazarus A.H.

Immunol. 1993; 151: 4513-4522PubMed Google Scholar). Ras is constitutively bound to the inner surface of the plasma membrane through post-translational modifications initiated predominantly by farnesyltransferase. Upon receptor stimulation, Ras-bound GDP is rapidly replaced with GTP by Ras guanyl nucleotide exchange factors, and Ras becomes active. The GTP-bound Ras recruits several cytoplasmic enzymes to the plasma membrane, including Raf kinases such as Raf-1 and B-Raf. The membrane-recruited Raf is activated and stimulates downstream MEK-ERK signaling cascade leading to transcriptional activation of downstream genes. The active state of Ras is only transient because its own GTPase activity hydrolyzes GTP into GDP with the aid of GTPase-activating proteins. In BCR signal transduction, Ras is mainly activated by RasGRP3 with a minor contribution of RasGRP1, both being Ras guanyl nucleotide exchange factors activated upon binding to diacylglycerol (24Oh-hora M. Johmura S. Hashimoto A. Hikida M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1841-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 25Coughlin J.J. Stang S.L. Dower N.A. Stone J.C. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7179-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol-activated PKC also contributes to the activation of RasGRP3 by a site-specific phosphorylation (26Teixeira C.

Blood. 2005; 105: 3648-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In B cells from RasGRP1/3 double null mutant mice, BCR ligation fails to induce activation of Ras and ERK as well as cell proliferation, indicating that BCR signaling through Ras is essential for B cell activation (25Coughlin J.J. Stang S.L. Dower N.A. Stone J.C. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7179-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although BLNK has been shown to be necessary for PLCγ2 activation in BCR signal transduction, BLNK-deficient (BLNK–) DT40 cells displayed normal Ras activation upon BCR cross-linking (7Ishiai M.

It was also shown that BLNK is required for efficient ERK activation in mouse splenic B cells when BCR stimulation is modest (29Xu S. Huo J. Chew W.K. Hikida M. Kurosaki T. Lam K.P. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 4690-4698Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These results suggest that BLNK is required for ERK activation in a Ras-independent pathway or, alternatively, that BLNK may link the active Ras to a downstream signaling pathway leading to full ERK activation. Here we demonstrate that BLNK directly binds active Ras and that this binding is critical for BCR-Ras co-capping and prolonged ERK activation leading to Elk1 activation upon BCR cross-linking.

For pApuroT7-cBLNK-S and pApuroT7-cBLNK(Δ133), a short form (cBLNK-S) (6Goitsuka R. Fujimura Y. Mamada H. Umeda A. Morimura T. Uetsuka K. Doi K. Tsuji S. Kitamura D. J.

Kitamura, unpublished result. were cloned into pApuroT7. The following internal deletion mutants of cBLNK were created by the two-step PCR. Two neighboring fragments were amplified independently using pCAT7-cBLNK as a template and each pair of primers (Table 1) in the first step, and the two fragments (1 ng each) were annealed through their 3′-end homologies, elongated to the 3′ ends, and amplified by PCR with the primers cBLNK1–1 and cBLNK-A in the second step. The resultant fragments were cloned into pApuroT7. The following primers were used in the first PCR: for pApuroT7-cBLNK(Δ134–158), cBLNK1–1 and cBLNK163–128, cBLNK129–164, and cBLNK-A; for pApuroT7-cBLNK(Δ135–144), cBLNK1–1 and cBLNK150–128, cBLNK129–151, and cBLNK-A; and for pApuroT7-cBLNK(Δ153–157), cBLNK1–1 and cBLNK162–146, cBLNK148–164, and cBLNK-A.TABLE 1Primers used in this studyPrimer nameSequence (5′ to 3′)cBLNK63GGGAATTCACCTCCAAGTCTACCACGAAGGGcBLNK-AAGTAGGGAGGGCTGATTTTGCGGGcBLNK159GGGAATTCACCCAGTTCAGCCTTGCCCAGACcBLNK1-1GGGAATTCTATGGACAAGCTGAACAAACcBLNK163-128CAAGGCTGAACTGGGAATAGGGAATGAGGAGGGcBLNK129-164TCCTCATTCCCTATTCCCAGTTCAGCCTTGCCCcBLNK150-128GGGAGGAAGCTGATGGTGAGAAATAGGGAATGAGGAGGGcBLNK129-151TCCTCATTCCCTATTTCTCACCATCAGCTTCCTCCCATCcBLNK162-146GGCTGAACTGGGTGTGTTGATGGGAGGAAGCTGATGcBLNK148-164CTTCCTCCCATCAACACACCCAGTTCAGCCTTGCCC Open table in a new tab The following vectors were made by general insert vector ligation. pECFP-cBLNK(Δ158) and pECFP-cBLNK(Δ134–158). EcoRI-SalI fragments of pApuroT7-cBLNK(Δ158) or pApuroT7-cBLNK(Δ134–158) were inserted into the same sites of pECFP-C1 (Clontech). For pEYFP-H-Ras and pEYFP-H-Ras(61L), an EcoRI-SalI fragment of pCMV-H-Ras or a KpnI-SmaI fragment of pCMV-H-Ras(61L) were inserted into the same sites of pEYFP-C1 (Clontech), respectively. For pEYFP-H-Ras(17N), an EcoRI-BamHI fragment of pCMV-H-Ras(17N) was first cloned into pBluescript II SK(–), and the KpnI-BamHI fragment thereof was inserted into the same sites of pEYFP-C1. CD8α:IgαF3RBD and CD8α:IgαF3 were constructed as follows: Cla12L-mCD8α:chIgαF3 (11Pike K.A. Ratcliffe M.J.H. J.

The resultant plasmid, Cla12L-mCD8α:chIgαF3-MCS, was digested with XhoI and BamHI, and the smaller fragment was replaced with a BLNK-RBD fragment made by PCR with primers (5′-CCGCTCGAGCATTCCCTATTTCTAGAGGTG-3′; the XhoI site is underlined; and 5′-CGGGATCCGTCGACTACTGATGGTGACTGGTGCGA-3′; the BamHI and SalI sites are underlined) and chicken BLNK cDNA as a template. By these procedures, a chicken BLNK sequence including the RBD, FPISRGEYADNRTSHHQ(stop), was fused to the C-terminal end of the chicken IgαF3 with an insertion of two linker amino acids (Arg and Ala). A SacI-SalI fragment from the resultant plasmid (mCD8α:chIgαF3-RBD), EcoRI/SalI-digested pApuro2, and annealed oligonucleotides (5′-AATTCAGATCTACTAGTGAGCT-3′ and 5′-CACTAGTAGATCTG-3′; the EcoRI and SacI protruding ends are underlined) were ligated together to generate pApuro2-CD8α:IgαF3RBD. A ClaI-ClaI fragment from Cla12L-mCD8α:chIgαF3 was inserted into an EcoRI site of pApuro2 through end blunting to generate pApuro2-CD8α:IgαF3. An Aor51HI-SalI fragment from the mCD8α:chIgαF3-RBD or an Aor51HI-XhoI fragment from the mCD8α:chIgαF3-MCS was cloned into the pCAT7-neo vector (32Morimura T. Goitsuka R. Zhang Y. Saito I. Reth M.

Cell Culture and Stimulation-DT40 cells and BLNK– DT40 cells were cultured and stimulated with anti-chicken IgM antibody (M4) as described previously (7Ishiai M. Kurosaki M. Pappu R. Okawa K.

Cos-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. BLNK– DT40 cells were electroporated with pApuroT7- or pApuro2-based vectors and selected with puromycin as described previously (32Morimura T. Goitsuka R. Zhang Y. Saito I. Reth M. Kitamura D. J.

BLNK– DT40 cells expressing mCD8α fusion receptors were stimulated with preincubation for 20 min on ice with rat anti-mouse CD8α monoclonal antibody (53–6.72), followed by incubation at 40 °C with goat anti-rat IgG F(ab′)2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for the indicated time periods. Luciferase Assay-Twenty μg of a vector expressing either the wild type or one of the mutant cBLNKs, as well as a mixture of the reporter vectors, 1 μg of pFA2-Elk1, 10 μg of pFR-Luc, and 1 μg of pRSV-β-gal were transfected into 5 × 106 BLNK– DT40 cells by electroporation. DT40 cells, BLNK– DT40 cells, and the latter stably transfected with BLNK-derived constructs or CD8α-IgαF3 constructs were transfected with the reporter vectors similarly. After 24 h, surface BCR or CD8α was stimulated as described above for 6 h, and the luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured as described previously (30Imamura Y. Katahira T.

ProteinAnalysis-Expressionvectors carrying either the wild type or one of the various mutant cBLNKs or one of the Igα constructs, all tagged with the T7 epitope, were mixed with either pCMV-H-Ras(61L) or pCMV-H-Ras(17N), tagged with the FLAG epitope, and with TransIT-LT1 reagents (Mirus). These mixtures were co-transfected into 2 × 106 Cos-7 cells. Two days after transfection, the cells were harvested, and the cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-T7 or anti-FLAG antibodies and analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (14Tsuji S.

To examine the association of endogenous BLNK and Ras proteins, the lysates of B cells purified from mouse spleens using MACS B cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) were subjected to immunoprecipitation using rabbit anti-BLNK antibody (18Hayashi K.

Antibodies-The following antibodies were purchased: mouse monoclonal anti-T7 tag (Novagen), goat anti-GST (GE Healthcare), mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (M5; Sigma-Aldrich), anti-pan Ras (Ab-3; Oncogene), anti-phospho-specific ERK (Cell Signaling), mouse monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 (Transduction Laboratories), anti-mouse CD8α (53–6.72), goat anti-rat IgG or anti-mouse IgM F(ab′)2 fragments (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Flow Cytometry-DT40-derived cells were stained with FITC-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgM antibody (Bethyl Laboratories) or FITC anti-mouse CD8α (53–6.72) and analyzed with FACSCalibur™ (Becton Dickinson) as described previously (34Hayashi K. Yamamoto M. Nojima T. Goitsuka R. Kitamura D. Immunity. 2003; 18: 825-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For the analysis of BCR-induced apoptosis, DT40 and DT40-derived cells (2 × 105/well) were stimulated in culture medium with or without anti-IgM (M4; 1.25 μg/ml) for 48 h in 12-well plates and then washed with the incubation buffer (10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2). Then the cells were stained with annexin V-biotin labeling solution (Roche Applied Science) and propidium iodide (1 μg/ml) for 15 min on ice. Then the cells were washed, stained with FITC-conjugated streptavidin (eBioscience) for 20 min on ice, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM)-CLSM was performed for cells transfected with the CFP- and YFP-tagged constructs as described previously (30Imamura Y. Katahira T. Kitamura D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26425-26432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). DT40 cells and their transfectants were stimulated as described above, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and stained with anti-chicken IgM-FITC (Bethyl Laboratories) or with anti-rat IgG-FITC (Southern Biotechnology Associates) for staining of rat anti-mouse CD8-labeled cells. Then the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with the blocking reagent (0.1% goat serum), and stained with anti-Ras (Ab-3), followed by and goat anti-mouse IgG-TRITC (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The stained cells were placed onto glass slides, covered with thin glass, and inspected with CLSM. Excitation wavelengths for FITC and TRITC were 488 and 568 nm, respectively. Emission signals were detected between 495 and 540 nm for FITC and between 585 and 610 nm for TRITC. Each result shown here is a representative of the data from the same experiments repeated at least and mostly more than twice. Identification of H-Ras as a Binding Partner of BLNK-To elucidate the mechanism of BLNK action in the BCR signal transduction, we sought to identify proteins interacting with BLNK by the yeast two-hybrid system. We screened the cDNA library from the chicken B cell line DT40 with a “bait” consisting of a 158-aa region of chicken BLNK (BLNK(1–158) and identified several independent clones as reported previously (31Katahira T. Imamura Y. Kitamura D. Int. Immunol. 2006; 18: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). From these clones, we identified one that interacts with BLNK(1–158), but not with a 62-aa region of BLNK (BLNK(1–62)), in the two-hybrid system, and the insert of this clone turned out to be a cDNA encoding an H-Ras protein with a truncation of the first three amino acids. To verify the binding of BLNK and H-Ras in vitro, we performed a GST pull-down assay. Human H-Ras proteins, either constitutively active (61L) or inactive (17N) mutant forms, were transiently expressed in Cos-7 cells, and the cell lysates were subjected to binding with GST-fused BLNK(1–158) or BLNK(1–62) proteins. As shown in Fig. 1A, only the active form bound to the GST-BLNK(1–158) protein, and neither forms bound to GST-BLNK(1–62) or GST alone. We next expressed the H-Ras proteins and T7-tagged mouse BLNK protein transiently in Cos-7 cells, and the BLNK-bound complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-T7 tag antibody (α-T7). As shown in Fig. 1B, only the active form of H-Ras was co-precipitated with BLNK. With the same system, we showed that the active H-Ras also bound to a full-length chicken BLNK (long form) as well as the shorter form of chicken BLNK that lacks the 40–58 aa region (6Goitsuka R. Fujimura Y. Mamada H. Umeda A. Morimura T. Uetsuka K. Doi K. Tsuji S. Kitamura D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5804-5808PubMed Google Scholar) and the BLNK with an N-terminal 133-aa deletion (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that the 134–158 aa region of chicken BLNK is responsible for the binding with the active H-Ras. We further examined the binding of endogenous Ras and BLNK proteins in mouse splenic B cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, immunoprecipitation with anti-BLNK antibody (α-BLNK) co-precipitated Ras protein from the cells stimulated with anti-IgM antibody but not from unstimulated cells. A control rabbit serum precipitated neither BLNK nor Ras. Thus, endogenous BLNK binds endogenous Ras in normal B cells after BCR stimulation. Co-localization of BLNK and the Constitutively Active H-Ras in Living Cells-To examine the binding of BLNK and Ras in living cells, we transfected expression vectors encoding CFP-tagged BLNK and YFP-tagged H-Ras proteins into Cos-7 cells and examined their intracellular localization with CLSM (Fig. 2). The CFP-tagged full length as well as deletion mutants of chicken BLNK lacking 1–62 (Δ62), 1–158 (Δ158), or 134–158 (Δ134–158) aa regions, respectively, were diffusely distributed throughout the cells with occasional exclusion from nuclei (Fig. 2A and Ref. 30Imamura Y. Katahira T. Kitamura D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26425-26432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In contrast, YFP-tagged wild type or the constitutively active (61L) or inactive (17N) forms of H-Ras were localized at plasma membrane, with accumulation in ruffles and lamellipodia, as well as at Golgi apparatus, as described previously (35Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 36Jiang X. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1522-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). When BLNK and wild type H-Ras were co-expressed, BLNK was distributed in the cytoplasm but with a noticeable accumulation at lamellipodia and Golgi area where H-Ras was co-localized, suggesting that the active H-Ras at these sites is associated with BLNK (Fig. 2B, top row). When BLNK was co-expressed with H-Ras(61L), H-Ras(61L) was mostly co-localized with BLNK in a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern (Fig. 2B, middle row), suggesting that the active Ras was trapped inside of the cell through binding with BLNK. By contrast, inactive H-Ras was mostly distributed at the periphery of the cells where BLNK was largely excluded (Fig. 2B, bottom row). The cellular localization pattern of co-expressed BLNK(Δ62) and H-Ras proteins was almost the same as that of wild type BLNK and H-Ras; BLNK(Δ62) was co-localized with wild type H-Ras at the peripheral lamellipodia, with the H-Ras(61L) diffusely throughout the cells and not co-localized with H-Ras(17N) (Fig. 2C; data not sh"
https://openalex.org/W2087325751,"Diet-induced weight loss is affected by a wide range of factors, including genetic variation. Identifying functional polymorphisms will help to elucidate mechanisms that account for variation in dietary metabolism. Previously, we reported a strong association between a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2419621 (C>T) in the promoter of acyl-CoA synthetase long chain 5 (ACSL5), rapid weight loss in obese Caucasian females, and elevated ACSL5 mRNA levels in skeletal muscle biopsies. Here, we showed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) that the T allele creates a functional cis-regulatory E-box element (CANNTG) that is recognized by the myogenic regulatory factor MyoD. The T allele promoted MyoD-dependent activation of a 1089-base pair ACSL5 promoter fragment in nonmuscle CV1 cells. Differentiation of skeletal myoblasts significantly elevated expression of the ACSL5 promoter. The T allele sustained promoter activity 48 h after differentiation, whereas the C allele showed a significant decline. These results reveal a mechanism for elevated transcription of ACSL5 in skeletal muscle of carriers of the rs2419621(T) allele, associated with more rapid diet-induced weight loss. Natural selection favoring promoter polymorphisms that reduced expression of catabolic genes in skeletal muscle likely accounts for the resistance of obese individuals to dietary intervention."

Here, we investigated the nuclear import of two human histone fold pairs, which belong to the H2A/H2B family: CHRAC-15/CHRAC-17 and p12/CHRAC-17. Our results from in vitro nuclear import assays with permeabilized cells and in vivo cotransfection experiments reveal that importin 13 facilitates nuclear import of both histone fold heterodimers. Using glutathione S-transferase pulldown experiments, we provide evidence that heterodimers are required for efficient binding of importin 13 because the monomers alone do not significantly interact. Mutational analysis shows that stepwise substitution of basic amino acid residues conserved among the histone fold subunits leads to a progressive loss of importin 13 binding and nuclear accumulation of CHRAC-15/CHRAC-17 and p12/CHRAC-17. The distribution of basic amino acid residues among the histone fold subunits essential for nuclear uptake suggests that heterodimerization of the histone fold motif-containing proteins forms an importin 13-specific binding platform.

In eukaryotic cells, bidirectional exchange of macromolecules between the cytosolic and nuclear compartment occurs exclusively through the nuclear pore complexes (1.Strom A.C. Weis K.

Molecules larger than 40 kDa have to be actively transported via soluble transport receptors that bind specific amino acid residues or sequence elements within the cargo protein. Nuclear export signals are recognized by exportins (export karyopherins), whereas importins (import karyopherins) bind to nuclear localization signals (NLS) 3The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal(s); NC2, negative cofactor 2; CHRAC, chromatin accessibility complex; ACF, ATP-dependent chromatin assembly and remodeling factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; RFP, red fluorescent protein; wt, wild type. 3The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal(s); NC2, negative cofactor 2; CHRAC, chromatin accessibility complex; ACF, ATP-dependent chromatin assembly and remodeling factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; RFP, red fluorescent protein; wt, wild type. that can be further differentiated in classical and nonclassical types. Proteins bearing a classical NLS are imported by a heterodimer of importin α and β (3.Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 4.Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Proteins with a nonclassical NLS are directly recognized by one import receptor without the help of the importin α adapter molecule. In contrast to classical NLSs, the definition of a putative nonclassical NLS sequence is difficult because its length and the pattern of NLS-specific amino acids can vary strongly among proteins (5.Christophe D. Christophe-Hobertus C. Pichon B. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Because of their structural flexibility, transport receptors can bind to very different signals, and some of them even function as import and export receptors. For instance, importin 13 recognizes the export substrate eIF1A and import cargoes such as hUbc9, RBM8 (6.Mingot J.M. Kostka S. Kraft R. Hartmann E. Gorlich D.

The p12/CHRAC-17 heterodimer was identified as an integral component of DNA-polymerase ϵ (26.Li Y. Pursell Z.F. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23247-23252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Polymerase ϵ is one of 14 DNA template-directed polymerases in humans responsible for DNA repair and DNA replication, and it is involved in cell cycle control (27.Nichols A.F. Sancar A.

In addition to the p12/CHRAC-17 complex, polymerase ϵ contains a 59-kDa subunit (p59) and the 261-kDa catalytic subunit (p261) (29.Li Y. Asahara H. Patel V.S. Zhou S. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32337-32344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here, we show that both histone fold pairs CHRAC-15/17 and p12/CHRAC-17 are transported into the nucleus by importin 13. Importin 13 binds specifically to the dimerized histone fold subunits, whereas the monomeric subunits are neither bound efficiently nor imported. Mutational analysis reveals that basic amino acid residues conserved among the histone fold subunits are necessary for efficient nuclear uptake. Cell Culture—HeLa P4-R5 MAGI (hereafter referred to as HeLa P4) cells (30.Charneau P. Mirambeau G. Roux P. Paulous S. Buc H. Clavel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (catalog number 3580) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). The medium was supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Biochrom), penicillin, streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Expression Constructs—The coding regions of the respective genes were amplified from plasmid DNA using specific primer pairs with appropriate restriction sites (for details see supplemental “Experimental Procedures”). All of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Site-directed Mutagenesis—To generate the nucleotide exchanges K47A, K92A, R69A, and R45A in p12; R25A, K70A, K47A, and R23A in CHRAC-15; K100A, R92A, K62A, and K86A in CHRAC-17; K18A, K63A, R40A, and R19A in NC2α and R101A, R102A, K95A, K64A, and K88A in NC2β site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit protocol (Stratagene). (For details see supplemental “Experimental Procedures.”) Transfection Experiments—Transfection into HeLa P4 cells was performed with the Effectene™ Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were fixed 24 h after transfection with 3% paraformaldehyde (w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed directly by fluorescence microscopy. Inactivation of exportin 1 in transfected HeLa P4 cells was performed 24 h post-transfection with 10 ng/ml leptomycin B (Sigma-Aldrich) for up to 6 h. For a semi-quantitative analysis, the cells were scored into three different categories: N>C (more reporter protein in the nucleus), N=C (equal distribution of reporter protein between nucleus and cytoplasm), and N<C (more reporter protein in the cytoplasm). Localization analysis of protein heterodimers was performed by measuring the fluorescence intensity in 20 cells using the software ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) followed by a calculation of the ratio between nuclear and cytoplasmic localization. Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—Epitope-tagged CHRAC-15/17 and p12/CHRAC-17 complexes were generated as follows: CHRAC-15 and CHRAC-17 as well as p12 and CHRAC-17 were coexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The cultures were grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.8 at 600 nm. After shifting the temperature to 25 °C, bacterial protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cultures were grown for 3 h. The collected bacteria were resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and lysed by sonication, and the recombinant complexes were purified on nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). For GST pulldown assays, a second purification step on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) followed. The following proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) as indicated and subsequently purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions: GST-CHRAC-15 and GST-CHRAC-17 at 25 °C for 3 h with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The collected bacteria were resuspended in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The following transport receptors were expressed in E. coli JM109 or TG1 as described in the literature indicated and were purified on nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) followed by gel filtration on Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare): Xenopus importin α1 (31.Gorlich D.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) was performed as described. Concentration Analysis of Recombinant Transport Receptors—After expression and purification of the transport receptors, the total protein concentration in the fractions was determined using the Quick Start Bradford Protein Assay Kit 3 (Bio-Rad). The percentage of full-length import receptor in these fractions was calculated using the program GelEval (Frogdance Software), comparing the band intensity of the full-length protein (verified by Western blotting) with the other bands. Based on these percentages, the protein concentration of the representative import receptor was calculated, and appropriate amounts were used for subsequent analysis. GST Pulldown Assays—GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B were used as affinity matrix for binding experiments. Appropriate amounts of affinity matrix were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 0.2 μm recombinant purified import receptors in buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The binding experiments were performed in the absence or presence of 2 μm RanQ69L(GTP). After washing the matrix-bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. In Vitro Nuclear Import Assays—Import reactions were performed as described previously (33.Jakel S. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) based on the method established by Adam et al. (36.Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Briefly, digitonin-permeabilized HeLa P4 cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 20 μl of a transport reaction mix consisting of 0.4 μm GST-CHRAC-15/His6-CHRAC-17 complex, either 10 μl of reticulocyte lysate (Promega) or 0.4 μm recombinant import receptor, and an energy-regenerating system (0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 50 μg/ml creatine kinase) in buffer D (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 110 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose). Performing reconstitution experiments with recombinant import receptors a Ran mix (3 μm RanGDP, 0.5 μm NTF2) was added. The GST-CHRAC-15/His6-CHRAC-17 complex was detected by indirect immunofluorescence using an anti-GST polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz). For quantification of nuclear import, 50-100 fluorescent cells were scored into the following categories: N>C (more reporter protein in the nucleus), N=C (equal distribution of reporter protein between nucleus and cytoplasm), and N<C (more reporter protein in the cytoplasm). Immunoblotting—HeLa P4 cells were harvested, and the proteins were separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose. Uniform blotting was checked by staining the nitrocellulose with Ponceau S (Sigma). The blots were probed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), polyclonal anti-green fluorescent protein antibody (Santa Cruz), a rabbit polyclonal anti-RFP antibody (MoBiTec), or anti-actin antibody (Sigma). The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the chemiluminescence ECL plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences) after incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) at a 1:100,000 dilution. The CHRAC-15/17 Complex Is Recognized and Imported by Importin 13—As part of the human chromatin accessibility complex CHRAC (17.Poot R.A. Dellaire G. Hulsmann B.B. Grimaldi M.A. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Bickmore W.A. Varga-Weisz P.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3377-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), the CHRAC-15/17 complex fulfills its function in the nuclear compartment. This and the close relationship to the histone fold-containing NF-YB/NF-YC heterodimer, which is specifically imported into the nucleus by importin 13 (10.Kahle J. Baake M. Doenecke D. Albig W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 5339-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), led to the question of whether the CHRAC-15/17 complex or histone fold heterodimers in general are recognized by importin 13. To address this question and to elucidate the potential role of importin 13, we first performed in vitro binding studies. For that purpose, the immobilized GST-CHRAC-15/His-CHRAC-17 complex was incubated with preassembled importin α/β, importin β, importin 5, importin 7, importin 9, and importin 13. Because dissociation of cargo proteins from the import receptors is controlled by RanGTP (37.Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 38.Gorlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), the binding studies were performed in the absence or presence of RanGTP. Importin 13 bound effectively and RanGTP sensitively to the CHRAC-15/17 complex, whereas binding of the other transport receptors to the heterodimer was not detected (Fig. 1A). To verify that importin 13 also mediates nuclear import of the CHRAC-15/17 complex, we next performed in vitro nuclear import assays (36.Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) with the affinity-purified GST-CHRAC-15/His-CHRAC-17 complex (Fig. 1C). Incubation with reticulocyte lysate led to a strong accumulation of the CHRAC-15/17 complex in the nucleus, whereas in the absence of transport factors a strict cytoplasmic retention was observed. As suggested by the strong RanGTP-sensitive binding of importin 13, the CHRAC-15/17 complex was imported into the nuclei of permeabilized cells by importin 13 (for quantification see Fig. 1D). Surprisingly, importin 5 facilitated nuclear uptake of the heterodimer, although it had not bound to the CHRAC-15/17 dimer in the binding studies. Taken together, the data suggest that importin 13 is a primary nuclear transport receptor for the CHRAC-15/17 heterodimer. Nuclear Accumulation of Overexpressed CHRAC-15/17 Complex Requires Coexpression of Importin 13—To elucidate nuclear import of the CHRAC-15/17 heterodimer in vivo, we coexpressed EGFP-CHRAC-15 and RFP-CHRAC-17 in HeLa P4 cells. Despite the exclusive nuclear localization of endogenous CHRAC-15 and CHRAC-17 (data not shown) and the strong nuclear accumulation of the GST-CHRAC-15/His-CHRAC-17 complex in the presence of nuclear transport receptors (reticulocyte lysate) in vitro (Fig. 1C), the fluorescently labeled subunits remained exclusively in the cytoplasm of transfected cells (Fig. 2A, top row). The same result was observed when the fluorescent proteins were exchanged among the two CHRAC subunits (supplemental Fig. S1A) or when the position of the fluorescent tags was changed from the N terminus to the C terminus (data not shown). Thus, the position of the two fluorescent tags within the CHRAC complex has presumably no effect on the cytoplasmic retention of the CHRAC-15/17 heterodimer. Because cytoplasmic localization of proteins results not only from the absence of a NLS, but also from nuclear export, we examined a possible role of the export receptor Crm1/exportin 1 (39.Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). For that purpose, HeLa P4 cells cotransfected with plasmid DNA encoding EGFP-CHRAC-15 and RFP-CHRAC-17 or RFP-CHRAC-15 and EGFP-CHRAC-17 were treated with leptomycin B, a specific inhibitor of exportin 1 (40.Nishi K. Yoshida M. Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6320-6324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic distribution of the fluorescently labeled CHRAC-15/17 complex was not affected by leptomycin B treatment (supplemental Fig. S2A), demonstrating that the CHRAC-15/17 dimer is not exported via exportin 1. Next, we examined whether inaccurate folding of the CHRAC-15/17 complex as a result of the overexpression was responsible for the cytoplasmic retention. For that, we coexpressed the HSP70 chaperone with fluorescently tagged CHRAC-15 and CHRAC-17 as shown in supplemental Fig. S2. The coexpression of HSP70, however, had no effect on the cytoplasmic localization of the CHRAC-15/17 complex (supplemental Fig. S2B). To investigate whether the CHRAC-15/17 dimer is imported in the nucleus via a piggy-back mechanism, the ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor 1 (ACF1) was coexpressed with CHRAC-15 and CHRAC-17 fused to either EGFP or RFP, respectively. Overexpression of ACF1 did not change the cytoplasmic localization of the CHRAC-15/17 complex (supplemental Fig. S2C). Finally, the influence of additionally coexpressed transport receptors was tested by cotransfection of EGFP-CHRAC-15 and RFP-CHRAC-17 with FLAG-tagged importin 13, importin β, importin 5, importin 7, or importin 9 (Fig. 2A). The coexpression of exogenous importin 13 led to an exclusively nuclear distribution of the CHRAC-15/17 complex (for quantitative analysis see Fig. 2B). In contrast, the coexpression of importin β, importin 5, importin 7, and importin 9, although expressed to a slightly lower degree than importin 13 (Fig. 2C), did not lead to any nuclear accumulation of the CHRAC-15/17 dimer. The same results were obtained when the fluorescent subunits were exchanged among the two CHRAC subunits (supplemental Fig. S1A). In summary, the nuclear transport capacity for the CHRAC-15/17 complex was confirmed for importin 13. In addition, a functional significance for importin 5 in the nuclear import of CHRAC-15/17 was excluded, because importin 5 depletion by small interfering RNA did not affect the endogenous localization of CHRAC-17, and functionality of coexpressed FLAG-tagged importin 5 was verified via nuclear uptake of PGC7/Stella (supplemental Fig. S3), a known importin 5 cargo (41.Nakamura T. Arai Y. Umehara H. Masuhara M. Kimura T. Taniguchi H. Sekimoto T. Ikawa M. Yoneda Y. Okabe M. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Nakano T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Full-length Importin 13 Is Required to Mediate Efficient Nuclear Import of the CHRAC-15/17 Complex—After confirming that importin 13 is the functional import receptor for the CHRAC-15/17 complex, we wanted to characterize the binding sites in importin 13. For that purpose, we generated different deletion constructs of importin 13 and tested their import capacity for the CHRAC-15/17 complex. According to the secondary structure prediction program PSIPRED (42.Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4332) Google Scholar, 43.McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar), importin 13 contains 38 α-helices. This is in line with the hypothesis that all transport receptors of the importin β family are comprised of 19 HEAT (huntingtin, elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, TOR1) repeats (44.Petosa C. Schoehn G. Askjaer P. Bauer U. Moulin M. Steuerwald U. Soler-Lopez M. Baudin F. Mattaj I.W. Muller C.W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 761-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Based on this prediction, we selectively deleted parts of importin 13 and coexpressed these truncated constructs with EGFP-CHRAC-15 and RFP-CHRAC-17. Among the different importin 13 deletions, amino acids 1-784 and 45-963 were still capable of facilitating nuclear accumulation of the CHRAC-15/17 complex (supplemental Fig. S4). All other importin 13 fragments did not transport CHRAC-15/17 into the nucleus. Because the importin 13 deletion that contains amino acids 45-963 lacks the putative RanGTP-binding site, which is essential for the dissociation of receptor-cargo complex, the last step of this particular nuclear transport process requires direct competition for either the cargo (CHRAC-15/17) or the receptor (importin 13). CHRAC-15 and CHRAC-17 Heterodimerize Prior to Nuclear Import, Which Is Not Altered by Subunit Phosphorylation—To analyze the influence of importin 13 on the subcellular localization of the individual CHRAC subunits, FLAG-tagged importin 13 was coexpressed separately with either fluorescently labeled CHRAC-15 or CHRAC-17 (Fig. 3, A and B). Whereas EGFP-CHRAC-15 was distributed homogenously within the cell, RFP-CHRAC-15 and the CHRAC-17 fusion proteins showed a strong cytoplasmic localization. In contrast to the CHRAC-15/17 dimer, the subcellular distribution of the monomeric histone fold subunits did not change upon coexpression of importin 13. Furthermore, nuclear accumulation of the individual subunits was not observed when other nuclear transport receptors were coexpressed (data not shown). Based on these data, it was not surprising that importin 13 bound only weakly to the individual GST-tagged subunits, CHRAC-15 or CHRAC-17 (Fig. 3C). These results demonstrate that the individual CHRAC subunits do not contain a NLS, and nuclear transport of CHRAC-15 and CHRAC-17 depends strictly on heterodimerization in the cytoplasm. Gnad et al. (45.Gnad F. Ren S. Cox J. Olsen J.V. Macek B. Oroshi M. Mann M. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R250.1-R250.13Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholar) recently identified three in vivo phosphorylation sites in the sequence of CHRAC-15 (Ser124 and Ser131) and in CHRAC-17 (Ser122) by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. To elucidate the potential role of phosphorylation on the nuclear transport of the CHRAC-15/17 complex, we substituted the three serine residues for glutamate to mimic the effect of phosphorylation. However, substitution of these amino acids did not alter the subcellular distribution of the individual CHRAC-15 and CHRAC-17 subunits nor of the CHRAC-15/17 complex. Coexpression of importin 13 led to a strong nuclear accumulation of the mutated CHRAC-15(S124E,S131E)/CHRAC-17(S122E) complex (data not shown). In contrast to our results, Gnad et al. (45.Gnad F. Ren S. Cox J. Olsen J.V. Macek B. Oroshi M. Mann M. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R250.1-R250.13Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholar) found both phosphorylated subunits in the cytoplasmatic fraction. Importin 13 Mediates the Nuclear Import of the p12/CH-RAC-17 Complex—Because the CHRAC-15/17 heterodimer behaves like its histone fold relative NF-YB/NF-YC (10.Kahle J. Baake M. Doenecke D. Albig W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 5339-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we asked whether importin 13 also transports other histone fold heterodimers. To address this question, we analyzed the nuclear import of the p12/CHRAC-17 heterodimer of DNA-polymerase ϵ. In vitro binding experiments with the immobilized GST-p12/His-CHRAC-17 complex showed strong binding of importin 13 (Fig. 4A) comparable with the results observed for the GST-CHRAC-15/His-CHRAC-17 complex (see again Fig. 1A). Besides importin 13, none of the other tested transport receptors bound to the p12/CHRAC-17 heterodimer. Coexpression of EGFP-p12 and RFP-CHRAC-17 in HeLa P4 cells led to a cytoplasmic distributi"
https://openalex.org/W2001302424,"Mammalian phosphofructokinase originated by duplication, fusion, and divergence of a primitive prokaryotic gene, with the duplicated fructose 6-phosphate catalytic site in the C-terminal half becoming an allosteric site for the activator fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. It has been suggested that both sites are shared across the interface between subunits aligned in an antiparallel orientation, the N-terminal half of one subunit facing the C-terminal half of the other. The composition of these binding sites and the way in which subunits interact to form the dimer within the tetrameric enzyme have been reexamined by systematic point mutations to alanine of key amino acid residues of human muscle phosphofructokinase. We found that residues His-199, His-298, Arg-201, and Arg-292 contribute to the catalytic site and not to the allosteric site, because their mutation decreased the affinity for fructose 6-phosphate without affecting the activation by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate or its binding affinity. In contrast, residues Arg-566, Arg-655, and His-661 were critical components of the fructose bisphosphate allosteric site, because their mutation strongly reduced the action and affinity of the activator, with no alteration of substrate binding to the active site. Our results suggest that mammalian phosphofructokinase subunits associate with the N-terminal halves facing each other to form the two catalytic sites/dimer and the C-terminal halves forming the allosteric sites. Additionally, mutation of certain residues eliminated activation by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, but not its binding, with little effect on activation by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, indicating a divergence in the signal transduction route despite their binding to the same site."

It positively or negatively controls a large variety of other regulatory genes, coordinating delimitation of segmental territories, specification of their identity, and maintenance of their integrity. We have investigated the molecular mechanisms of Krox20 transcriptional control by performing a detailed structure-function analysis of the protein in the developing chick hindbrain. This revealed an unsuspected diversity in the modes of action of a transcription factor in a single tissue, since regulation of each of the five tested target genes requires different parts of the protein and/or presumably different co-factors. The multiplicity of Krox20 functions might rely on this diversity. Investigation of known Krox20 co-factors was initiated in relation to this analysis. Nab was shown to act as a negative feedback modulator of the different Krox20 activating functions in the hindbrain.

Moens C.B. Development.. 2001; 128: 4139-4151Google Scholar). Integrating this complex regulatory network constitutes a major challenge for reaching a comprehensive understanding of the segmentation process. Krox20, also known as Egr2, is among these key regulatory genes and encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor (32Chavrier P. Zerial M. Lemaire P. Almendral J. Bravo R. Charnay P. EMBO J... 1988; 7: 29-35Google Scholar, 33Joseph L.J. Le Beau M.M. Jamieson Jr. G.A. Acharya S. Shows T.B. Rowley J.D. Sukhatme V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature.. 1989; 337: 461-464Google Scholar), and has been shown to be required for the formation and maintenance of these segments (28Schneider-Maunoury S. Topilko P. Seitandou T. Levi G.

More precisely, it was established that Krox20 plays multiple and complex roles in the initial formation and subsequent delimitation of the r3 and r5 territories (28Schneider-Maunoury S. Topilko P.

Schneider-Maunoury S. Development.. 2001; 128: 4967-4978Google Scholar). To fulfill these different functions, Krox20 controls the expression, either positively or negatively, of a number of other regulatory genes. These include Krox20 itself (28Schneider-Maunoury S.

Many of the genes positively regulated by Krox20 constitute direct transcriptional targets of this factor, which binds to neighboring cis-acting sequences (39Theil T. Frain M. Gilardi-Hebenstreit P.

Cell.. 1993; 72: 183-196Google Scholar), whereas the repression of one gene, Hoxb1, was shown not to involve direct binding of Krox20 to DNA (43Garcia-Dominguez M. Gilardi-Hebenstreit P. Charnay P. EMBO J... 2006; 25: 2432-2442Google Scholar). However, in most cases, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the various transcriptional activities of Krox20 have not been studied. Although several proteins have been shown to interact with Krox20 and/or to interfere with its activity, most of these studies were carried out in vitro and/or using artificial Krox20 targets, and it is therefore difficult to extrapolate their conclusions to any specific Krox20 target in an in vivo situation, including the hindbrain. Nab proteins have been shown to bind a motif called R1 present in Egr/Krox family members and were initially described as antagonists of Krox20 and Krox24 (also known as Egr1/Zif268) activating function in cultured cells (42Russo M.W. Sevetson B.R. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 6873-6877Google Scholar, 49LeBlanc S.E. Jang S.W. Ward R.M. Wrabetz L. Svaren J. J. Biol.

Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1998; 18: 512-524Google Scholar). However, this view was recently challenged by data suggesting that Nabs can also behave as positive modulators of Krox20 activity in cultured cells (52Sevetson B.R. Svaren J. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 9749-9757Google Scholar) and, like Krox20, promote myelination in Schwann cells (53Desmazières A. Decker L. Vallat J.M. Charnay P. Gilardi-Hebenstreit P. J. Neurosci... 2008; 28: 5891-5900Google Scholar, 54Le N. Nagarajan R. Wang J.Y. Svaren J. LaPash C. Araki T. Schmidt R.E. Milbrandt J. Nat. Neurosci... 2005; 8: 932-940Google Scholar). HCF-1 and Ddx20 factors have been described as potential co-activator and co-repressor of Krox20, respectively, in cultured cells (55Luciano R.L. Wilson A.C. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 51116-51124Google Scholar, 56Gillian A.L. Svaren J. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 9056-9063Google Scholar). The only documented case in respect to hindbrain development is the interaction of Krox20 with PIASxβ, which is involved in the repression of Hoxb1 (43Garcia-Dominguez M. Gilardi-Hebenstreit P. Charnay P. EMBO J... 2006; 25: 2432-2442Google Scholar). The understanding of Krox20 function in hindbrain development therefore justifies further efforts to decipher the mechanisms involved in the regulation of its various target genes in the embryo and in particular to identify which co-factors are involved. In the present work, using electroporation of the chick hindbrain, we have initiated such an in vivo analysis by localizing the domains of the Krox20 protein that are required for the regulation of five genes that are representatives of the various Krox20 transcriptional targets. This revealed an unexpected diversity in the modes of action of a transcription factor in a single tissue, since regulation of each of these targets appeared to require different parts of the protein and/or presumably different co-factors. This diversity is likely to constitute an important element for Krox20 to fulfill its multiple functions. Investigation of co-factors involved in Krox20 transcriptional function established that the Nab proteins act as general antagonists of transcriptional activation by Krox20 in the hindbrain, and HCF-1 was shown to bind to a Krox20 N-terminal region required for Krox20 autoregulation. Expression Plasmid Constructions—The complete mouse Krox20-expressing plasmid, pAdRSVKrox20HA, is derived from pAdRSVKrox20 (37Giudicelli F. Taillebourg E. Charnay P. Gilardi-Hebenstreit P. Genes Dev... 2001; 15: 567-580Google Scholar) by the addition of a sequence encoding an HA 3The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; HBM, HCF binding motif. epitope (TACCCATACGACGTACCAGACTACGCATCG) just before the STOP codon. The N-terminal deletions were generated by the replacement of the AvrII-BglII fragment from the pAdRSVKrox20HA plasmid by 5′-deleted versions generated by PCR using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). The 5′ primers contained an AvrII restriction site followed by an ATG initiation codon and 21 nucleotides encoding the 7 N-terminal amino acids of the deleted constructs and the 3′ primer encoded the HA tag followed by the BglII restriction site. The Krox20 Δ159-189 construct was generated using the Exsite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's instructions. The pAdRSVKrox20I268FHA plasmid was obtained by introducing a point mutation changing ATC (isoleucine) into TTC (phenylalanine) at the level of codon 268 using the Quikchange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The VP16-Krox20 construct was generated by fusion of a sequence encoding VP16 activation domain (amino acids 413-490) (57Das G. Hinkley C.S. Herr W. Nature.. 1995; 374: 657-660Google Scholar) to the 3′ part of Krox20 (corresponding to amino acids 309-470) followed by cloning into the pAdRSVSp vector (58Giudicelli F. Gilardi-Hebenstreit P. Mechta-Grigoriou F. Poquet C. Charnay P. Dev. Biol... 2003; 253: 150-162Google Scholar). The mouse Nab1- and Nab2-expressing plasmids, pAdRSVNab1HA and pAdRSVNab2HA, were constructed by cloning the coding sequences into the pAdRSVSp vector (58Giudicelli F. Gilardi-Hebenstreit P. Mechta-Grigoriou F. Poquet C. Charnay P. Dev. Biol... 2003; 253: 150-162Google Scholar), with the addition of an HA epitope coding sequence just before the STOP codon. The coding sequences of Nab1 and Nab2 were obtained by PCR amplification from the IMAGE clones MRC 426565 and MRC 6306757, respectively, and using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). The mouse HCF-1 β-propeller-expressing plasmid was constructed by cloning the coding sequence corresponding to the first 380 amino acids of HCF-1 into the pCMVsport6 vector, with the insertion of a FLAG epitope sequence (GATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGCTA) just after the initiation codon. The insert was amplified by PCR from the RZPD IMAGE clone 6509535 using the Phusion PCR system (Finnzymes). For all constructs, cloning junctions and point mutations were verified by sequencing, and the sizes and levels of expression of the proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting performed on extracts from transiently transfected 293 cells or electroporated chick embryos, using anti-HA (anti-HA high affinity rat monoclonal antibody; Roche Applied Science; reference number 1867423, dilution 1:400) or anti-FLAG antibodies (anti-FLAG rabbit polyclonal IgG; Sigma; reference number F7425, dilution 1:400). Cell Culture, Transfection, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting Assays—COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Transient transfection was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Cells were analyzed 48 h after transfection. For protein immunoprecipitation with the anti-HA antibody, transfected COS-7 cells were harvested in the following buffer: 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Western blotting was performed using the ECL procedure according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences) with a rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (HA probe (Y-11); Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); reference number sc-805, dilution 1:2000) to quantify Krox20 protein or an anti-FLAG rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma; reference number F7425, dilution 1:2000) to detect the co-immunoprecipitated HCF β-propeller or a rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP (Invitrogen; reference number A11122, dilution 1:2000). In Ovo Electroporation, Whole Mount Immunohistochemistry, and in Situ Hybridization—Electroporation and preparation of chick embryos for immunolabeling or in situ hybridization were performed as described previously (37Giudicelli F. Taillebourg E. Charnay P. Gilardi-Hebenstreit P. Genes Dev... 2001; 15: 567-580Google Scholar). Briefly, fertilized hen eggs were incubated for 30 h up to stages HH8-HH10 before injection. DNA solution was injected at a concentration of 1 μg/μl into the neural tube of the embryo in ovo, and electroporation was performed with a BTX830 electroporator (Quantum) using the parameters previously described (37Giudicelli F. Taillebourg E. Charnay P. Gilardi-Hebenstreit P. Genes Dev... 2001; 15: 567-580Google Scholar). 20-24 h after electroporation, embryos were recovered in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in paraformaldehyde (4%), and processed for immunochemistry or in situ hybridization. Immunochemical detection of proteins was performed with the following antibodies: rat monoclonal against HA epitope (Roche Applied Science; 1:400) followed by biotin-coupled goat antibody anti-rat IgG (Jackson; 1:200) and Cy3-Streptavidin (Jackson; 1:200) or mouse monoclonal antibody against EphA4 (37Giudicelli F. Taillebourg E. Charnay P. Gilardi-Hebenstreit P. Genes Dev... 2001; 15: 567-580Google Scholar) (1:20), followed by Alexa 488-coupled goat antibody anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes; 1:200). In situ hybridization was performed as described (59Wilkinson D.G. Nieto M.A. Methods Enzymol... 1993; 225: 361-373Google Scholar), using digoxigenin-labeled probes. The probes were as follows: chick Krox20 (37Giudicelli F. Taillebourg E. Charnay P. Gilardi-Hebenstreit P. Genes Dev... 2001; 15: 567-580Google Scholar), chick EphA4 (60Sajjadi F.G. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene.. 1993; 8: 1807-1813Google Scholar), chick Hoxb1 (61Graham A. Lumsden A. Development.. 1996; 122: 473-480Google Scholar, 62Guthrie S. Muchamore I. Kuroiwa A. Marshall H. Krumlauf R. Lumsden A. Nature.. 1992; 356: 157-159Google Scholar), chick follistatin (61Graham A. Lumsden A. Development.. 1996; 122: 473-480Google Scholar), chick Nab (nucleotides 927-1563 of Gallus gallus Nab mRNA, NM 204268), and chick Hcf (the probe was derived from HCF BBSRC chick expressed sequence tag ChEST953i24 and corresponds to the first 661 nucleotides of this sequence). The activities of the mutant proteins were classified in different categories (activation (+), weak activation (+/0), no activity (0), and repression (-)) by evaluation of the number of positive or negative cells. The territories that were taken into account depend on the target gene, since the domains of competence are different for different targets. For the activation of Krox20 and Nab, we evaluated the total number of ectopic positive cells by embryo in r1, r2, r4, and r6 on the electroporated side and classified the embryos as follows: >200 cells (+); >20 and <50 cells (+/0); <10 cells (0). If >200 negative cells were found in r3 and r5, it was classified as (-). For the activation of EphA4, we have evaluated the number of ectopic positive cells in r2, r4, and r6 and classified the embryos as follows: >150 cells (+); >20 and <50 cells (+/0); <10 cells (0). For the repression of Hoxb1, if >100 negative cells were found in r4 on the electroporated side, the embryo was classified as (-). In the case of follistatin, the embryos in which a clear weaker density of positive cells was observed in r2 and r4 on the electroporated side were classified as (-). To analyze the mechanisms of the transcriptional regulation by Krox20 and to investigate the involvement of co-factors, we engaged into delineating the domains of the protein required for the control of different targets in the developing hindbrain. As a first step, the analysis of the evolutionary conservation of Krox20 amino acid sequence allowed the division of the protein into three regions (Fig. S1): (i) a large N-terminal domain corresponding approximately to two-thirds of the protein, which is relatively well conserved with nevertheless some small areas of divergence; (ii) an internal region (positions 312-425) that is extremely conserved and corresponds to the DNA binding domain (zinc fingers) flanked by upstream and downstream basic sequences; (iii) a short C-terminal region that is very poorly conserved and is therefore not likely to play an important functional role. This distribution led us to concentrate on the N-terminal domain that appeared more likely to harbor transcriptional activation and repression domains. We therefore generated a nested series of N-terminal external deletions carrying a C-terminal HA tag (Fig. 1; we have previously shown that the presence of a C-terminal tag does not affect the properties of the protein (37Giudicelli F. Taillebourg E. Charnay P. Gilardi-Hebenstreit P. Genes Dev... 2001; 15: 567-580Google Scholar)), electroporated expression constructs in the chick embryo hindbrain, and compared their transcriptional activities with that of the wild type protein on five known Krox20 target genes. Transactivation of Different Targets Involves Distinct Mechanisms—We first focused on three target genes that are positively regulated by Krox20: Krox20 itself, Nab, and EphA4 (39Theil T. Frain M. Gilardi-Hebenstreit P. Flenniken A. Charnay P. Wilkinson D.G. Development.. 1998; 125: 443-452Google Scholar, 40Chomette D. Frain M. Cereghini S. Charnay P. Ghislain J. Development.. 2006; 133: 1253-1262Google Scholar-41Mechta-Grigoriou F. Garel S. Charnay P. Development.. 2000; 127: 119-128Google Scholar). Krox20 and EphA4 have further been shown to constitute direct transcriptional targets of the Krox20 protein in the hindbrain, and the cis-acting elements mediating these regulations have been identified (39Theil T. Frain M. Gilardi-Hebenstreit P. Flenniken A. Charnay P. Wilkinson D.G. Development.. 1998; 125: 443-452Google Scholar, 40Chomette D. Frain M. Cereghini S. Charnay P. Ghislain J. Development.. 2006; 133: 1253-1262Google Scholar). The three genes are ectopically activated by wild type Krox20 in chick in ovo electroporation experiments (37Giudicelli F. Taillebourg E. Charnay P. Gilardi-Hebenstreit P. Genes Dev... 2001; 15: 567-580Google Scholar). This procedure allows unilateral introduction of DNA into the chick neural tube, the nonelectroporated side serving as a control to the experimental one. Mouse Nab genes (Nab1 and Nab2) have been shown to require Krox20 for their expression in r3 and r5 (41Mechta-Grigoriou F. Garel S. Charnay P. Development.. 2000; 127: 119-128Google Scholar). In the chick, there is only one Nab gene known, and its regulation has not been investigated so far. We showed by in situ hybridization that chick Nab expression follows that of Krox20 in the hindbrain, with an initiation at around the 7 and 9 somite stages in r3 and r5, respectively (Fig. S2, A-D). In ovo electroporation of the HA-tagged complete Krox20 construct efficiently induced Krox20, Nab, and EphA4 expression in the neural tube (Fig. 2, A, J, and Q). Interestingly, the rostral limits of efficient ectopic expression appeared different, corresponding to the r1/r2 boundaries for EphA4, whereas no rostral restriction was observed for Krox20 or Nab. Furthermore, ectopic activation of EphA4 was strong in r2 and progressively decreased in r4 and r6 (Fig. 2Q), whereas activation of Krox20 and Nab was relatively uniform in the hindbrain (Fig. 2, A and J). In conclusion, these data indicate that Krox20 can activate its own transcription as well as that of EphA4 and Nab in the hindbrain but that different regional restrictions apply to different targets. This suggests that different limiting and unevenly distributed co-factors are required for the transcriptional activation of these genes and therefore that the molecular mechanisms involved are distinct. The Various Krox20 Transcriptional Activities Are Mediated by Different Domains—The next step was to compare the transcriptional activities of the different Krox20 N-terminal deletions on the three positive targets. Functional analysis of the deletions showed that transcriptional activations of Krox20 and Nab on one side and EphA4 on the other require different parts of Krox20. Whereas the deletion of the first 190 N-terminal amino acids (Krox20 Δ1-190) completely abolished the ability of Krox20 to activate endogenous Krox20 or Nab (Table 1 and Fig. 2, A, E, J, and L), this construct was still able to efficiently induce EphA4 expression (Table 1 and Fig. 2, Q and R). It is interesting to note that the deletion mutants that were not able to ectopically activate Krox20 actually partially repressed its expression in r3 and r5 (Table 1 and Fig. 2, E-G), therefore presenting a possible dominant-negative behavior that was not observed with the Nab target (Fig. 2, L and N).Table 1Transcriptional activities of the different Krox20 mutants Krox20 Krox20 Δ1-50 Krox20 Δ1-81 Krox20 Δ1-124 Krox20 Δ1-158 Krox20 Δ1-190 Krox20 Δ1-216 Krox20 Δ1-235 Krox20 Δ1-258 Krox20 Δ1-309 Krox20 Δ159-189 Krox20 I268F VP16 Krox20 Krox20 + (27/32) + (5/5) + (4/4) +/0 (11/11) +/0 (10/10) − (14/14) ND ND − (6/6) − (4/5) + (3/4) + (7/7) 0 (6/6) Nab + (21/22) ND + (4/4) + (4/5) + (3/4) 0 (17/17) ND ND 0 (4/4) 0 (4/4) + (5/6) + (16/17) + (6/6) KphA4 + (36/38) ND + (4/4) + (4/4) + (7/7) + (18/20) + (10/12) +/0 (7/7) +/0 (8/8) +/0 (8/8) + (8/10) + (12/13) 0 (14/14) follistatin − (7/10) ND ND − (3/4) ND − (5/12) − (4/5) 0 (5/5) 0 (8/8) 0 (5/5) ND ND ND Hoxb1 − (20/26) ND ND ND ND − (6/6) ND ND − (3/4) − (4/7) ND − (3/4) ND Open table in a new tab Further deletions indicated that an element essential for EphA4 induction was located between positions 216 and 235 (Table 1 and Fig. 2, S and T). However, a very low level of EphA4 activation was maintained with Krox20 Δ1-235 as well as with further deletions eliminating the entire N-terminal region (Table 1 and Fig. 2, T-V). The N-terminal part of Krox20 contains two acidic domains (Fig. 1) whose deletion was previously shown to affect transcriptional activation of an artificial reporter construc"
https://openalex.org/W2076834308,"The number of available structures of large multi-protein assemblies is quite small. Such structures provide phenomenal insights on the organization, mechanism of formation and functional properties of the assembly. Hence detailed analysis of such structures is highly rewarding. However, the common problem in such analyses is the low resolution of these structures. In the recent times a number of attempts that combine low resolution cryo-EM data with higher resolution structures determined using X-ray analysis or NMR or generated using comparative modeling have been reported. Even in such attempts the best result one arrives at is the very course idea about the assembly structure in terms of trace of the C(alpha) atoms which are modeled with modest accuracy.In this paper first we present an objective approach to identify potentially solvent exposed and buried residues solely from the position of C(alpha) atoms and amino acid sequence using residue type-dependent thresholds for accessible surface areas of C(alpha). We extend the method further to recognize potential protein-protein interface residues. CONCLUSION/ SIGNIFICANCE: Our approach to identify buried and exposed residues solely from the positions of C(alpha) atoms resulted in an accuracy of 84%, sensitivity of 83-89% and specificity of 67-94% while recognition of interfacial residues corresponded to an accuracy of 94%, sensitivity of 70-96% and specificity of 58-94%. Interestingly, detailed analysis of cases of mismatch between recognition of interface residues from C(alpha) positions and all-atom models suggested that, recognition of interfacial residues using C(alpha) atoms only correspond better with intuitive notion of what is an interfacial residue. Our method should be useful in the objective analysis of structures of protein assemblies when positions of only (alpha) positions are available as, for example, in the cases of integration of cryo-EM data and high resolution structures of the components of the assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2002176724,"Recent advances in biomedical research have resulted in the development of specific biomarkers for diagnostic testing of disease condition or physiological risk. Of specific interest are αII-spectrin breakdown products (SBDPs), which are produced by proteolytic events in traumatic brain injury and have been used as biomarkers to predict the severity of injury in humans and other mammalian brain injury models. This study describes and demonstrates the successful use of antibody-based mammalian SBDP biomarkers to detect head injury in migrating juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that have been injured during passage through high-energy hydraulic environments present in spillways under different operational configurations. Mortality and injury assessment techniques currently measure only near-term direct mortality and easily observable acute injury. Injury-based biomarkers may serve as a quantitative indicator of subacute physical injury and recovery, and aid hydropower operators in evaluation of safest passage configuration and operation actions for migrating juvenile salmonids. We describe a novel application of SBDP biomarkers for head injury for migrating salmon. To our knowledge, this is the first documented cross-over use of a human molecular biomarker in a wildlife and operational risk management scenario."
