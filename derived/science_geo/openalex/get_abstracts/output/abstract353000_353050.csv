https://openalex.org/W1983991097,"MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that can regulate gene expression by interacting with multiple mRNAs and inducing either translation suppression or degradation of mRNA. Recently, several miRNAs were identified as either promoters or suppressors of metastasis. However, it is unclear in which step(s) of the multistep metastatic cascade these miRNAs play a defined functional role. To study the functional importance of miRNAs in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process thought to initiate metastasis by enhancing the motility of tumor cells, we used a well established in vitro EMT assay: transforming growth factor-beta-induced EMT in NMuMG murine mammary epithelial cells. We found that members of the miR-200 family, organized as two clusters in the genome, were repressed during EMT. Overexpression of each miRNA individually or as clusters in NMuMG cells hindered EMT by enhancing E-cadherin expression through direct targeting of ZEB1 and ZEB2, which encode transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin. In the 4TO7 mouse carcinoma cell line, which expresses low levels of endogenous E-cadherin and displays a mesenchymal phenotype, ectopic expression of the miR-200 family miRNAs significantly increased E-cadherin expression and altered cell morphology to an epithelial phenotype. Furthermore, ectopic expression of each miR-200 miRNA cluster significantly reduced the in vitro motility of 4TO7 cells in migration assays. These results suggested that loss of expression of the miR-200 family members may play a critical role in the repression of E-cadherin by ZEB1 and ZEB2 during EMT, thereby enhancing migration and invasion during cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2129482488,"To describe the baseline demographic data, clinical characteristics and HIV-incidence rates of a cohort at high risk for HIV infection in South Africa as well as the challenges experienced in establishing and maintaining the cohort.Between August 2004 and May 2005 a cohort of HIV-uninfected women was established for the CAPRISA 002 Acute Infection Study, a natural history study of HIV-1 subtype C infection. Volunteers were identified through peer-outreach. The cohort was followed monthly to determine HIV infection rates and clinical presentation of early HIV infection. Risk reduction counselling and male and female condoms were provided. After screening 775 individuals, a cohort of 245 uninfected high-risk women was established. HIV-prevalence at screening was 59.6% (95% CI: 55.9% to 62.8%) posing a challenge in accruing HIV-uninfected women. The majority of women (78.8%) were self-identified as sex-workers with a median of 2 clients per day. Most women (95%) reported more than one casual sexual partner in the previous 3 months (excluding clients) and 58.8% reported condom use in their last sexual encounter. Based on laboratory testing, 62.0% had a sexually transmitted infection at baseline. During 390 person-years of follow-up, 28 infections occurred yielding seroincidence rate of 7.2 (95% CI: 4.5 to 9.8) per 100 person-years. Despite the high mobility of this sex worker cohort retention rate after 2 years was 86.1%. High co-morbidity created challenges for ancillary care provision, both in terms of human and financial resources.Challenges experienced were high baseline HIV-prevalence, lower than anticipated HIV-incidence and difficulties retaining participants. Despite challenges, we have successfully accrued this cohort of HIV-uninfected women with favourable retention, enabling us to study the natural history of HIV-1 during acute HIV-infection. Our experiences provide lessons for others establishing similar cohorts, which will be key for advancing the vaccine and prevention research agenda in resource-constrained settings."

Hence, hORCTL3 is an organic anion transporter, and we renamed it hOAT10. [3H]Nicotinate transport by hOAT10 into X. laevis oocytes and into Caco-2 cells was saturable with Michaelis constants (Km) of 22 and 44 μm, respectively, suggesting that hOAT10 may be the molecular equivalent of the postulated high affinity nicotinate transporter in kidneys and intestine. The pH dependence of hOAT10 suggests p-aminohippurate–/OH–, urate–/OH–, and nicotinate–/OH– exchange as possible transport modes. Urate inhibited [3H]nicotinate transport by hOAT10 with an IC50 value of 759 μm, assuming that hOAT10 represents a low affinity urate transporter. hOAT10-mediated [14C]urate uptake was elevated by an exchange with l -lactate, pyrazinoate, and nicotinate. Surprisingly, we have detected urate–/glutathione exchange by hOAT10, consistent with an involvement of hOAT10 in the renal glutathione cycle.

The kidneys represent one avenue for the secretion of a large number of charged molecules. Among these are metabolites as well as exogenous substances such as drugs and environmental toxins, which are substrates for transporters of a family called solute carrier (SLC) 2The abbreviations used are: SLC, solute carrier; OAT, organic anion transporter; OCT, organic cation transporter; PAH, p-aminohippurate; CCD, cortical collecting duct; SMCT1, sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter; URAT1, urate transporter 1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; BBMV, brush border membrane vesicle; BLMV, basolateral membrane vesicle; HCTZ, hydrochlorothiazide; ES, estrone sulfate. family 22A. This transporter family consists of organic anion transporters (OATs), organic cation transporters (OCTs), and zwitterion transporters. In the last decade, many members of these three subfamilies were identified and functionally characterized (for review see Refs. 1Wright S.H. Dantzler W.H. Physiol.

Daigo Y. Tamari M. Fujii Y. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1998; 83: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It was speculated that hORCTL3 may function as a polyspecific organic cation transporter in several tissues. However, protein sequence alignments of all known OCTs and OATs, including the nonclassified orphan transporters listed in solute carrier family 22 (SLC22) revealed several highly conserved amino acids (data not shown). On the basis of these amino acid comparisons, we hypothesized that hORCTL3 is an organic anion transporter. In the present paper, we have examined the properties of the orphan transporter human ORCTL3. We have found that hORCTL3 is highly expressed at the apical side of renal proximal tubule cells in a gender-dependent manner. Furthermore, we provide evidence that hORCTL3 is a urate and the first identified high affinity nicotinate exchanger in kidneys and intestine. Therefore, we renamed hORCTL3 hOAT10 (human organic anion transporter 10). Finally, we present the first molecular data for a cyclosporine A-induced hyperuricemia via elevation of urate reabsorption by hOAT10. Reagents—Materials used included fetal bovine serum, trypsin, and PBS from Invitrogen. Buffer ingredients and unlabeled substrates were provided by Sigma-Aldrich. [2-3H]PAH (3.25 Ci/mmol) was provided by PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [8-14C]Uric acid (urate) (50 Ci/mmol) and [5,6-3H]nicotinic acid (nicotinate) (60 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Biotrend (Cologne, Germany). cDNA Clone—Sequencing of the entire expressed sequence tag clone, which we purchased from the Resource Center/Primary Data Base, cloned into pSPORT6 expression vector (IMAGp998D1711455Q3; GenBank™ accession number BI517655), using an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Weiterstadt, Germany) and on-line services (e.g. the Multiple Sequence Alignment Program) (26Huang X. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 227-235PubMed Google Scholar) revealed the complete open reading frame of the novel hOAT10. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA of several different tissues (First Choice Human Total RNA panel) were obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). Total RNA from Caco-2 cells (6 days after confluence) was prepared with SV-total RNA isolation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 2 μg of each total RNA was reverse transcribed in a 20-μl assay applying 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus RT (Promega) for 1 h at 37°C. 4–5 μl of the respective RT was used in a PCR with hOAT10_299 (sense) 5′-CCACCGCTTCAATGAGAC-3′, hOAT10_1038 (antisense) 5′-GACTGTCCACAAACCAGAC-3′, GAPDH_334 (sense) 5′-TCACCATCTTCCAGGAGCG-3′, and GAPDH_905 (antisense) 5′-CTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGA-3′ as a control, performing 35 cycles (for hOAT10 tissue expression), 40 cycles (for hOAT10 expression in Caco-2 cells), and 20 cycles (for GAPDH) at 94 °C for 20 s, at 55 °C (for hOAT10) or 58 °C (for GAPDH) for 30 s, and at 72 °C for 1.5 min followed by a single 10-min cycle at 72 °C for extension. RT-PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized using ethidium bromide and a computer-based documentation system (Intas, Göttingen, Germany). Real Time PCR Analysis—Total RNA of human female kidney and cDNA from these probes were prepared as described previously (27Sindic A. Hirsch J.R. Velic A. Piechota H. Schlatter E. Kidney Int. 2005; 67: 1420-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Real time PCR was performed using hORCTL3-specific TaqMan primers and the real time PCR kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Antibody, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blot Analysis—An immune serum against the peptide sequence in the internal loop of the protein (amino acids 306–319, LMNQLVPEKTGPSG), which is highly conserved among the species hOAT10 (GenBank™ NP_004247 for Homo sapiens), rOat10 (XP_236685 for Rattus norwegicus), and mOat10 (NP_598741 for Mus musculus), was raised in chicken (BioGenes, Berlin, Germany), and the antibody (hOAT10-Ab) was affinity-purified. Brush border (BBMV) and basolateral (BLMV) membrane vesicles from male and BBMVs from female Wistar rat kidneys were prepared as previously described (28Krick W. Wolff N.A. Burckhardt G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 441: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 29Shimada H. Moewes B. Burckhardt G. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F795-F801PubMed Google Scholar). Before use, total protein was extracted from 1 mg of each vesicle preparation, employing the NucleoSpin® RNA/protein kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). The final protein pellet was resolved in 200 μl of the supplied buffer, and protein concentration was determined according to the Bradford protocol (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). 50 μg of the denatured (95 °C for 5 min) protein of each vesicle probe was loaded on a 10% denaturating polyacrylamide gel followed by an electrophoretical wet transfer for 1 h at 350 mA and 4°C using a Mini Trans blot electrophoretic transfer cell (both Bio-Rad) to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roche Applied Science). After transfer, the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was blocked for 2 h in blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk in PBS) and incubated at 4 °C overnight (12–14 h) in PBS buffer containing 0.5% nonfat dry milk and hOAT10-Ab (1:500), which was blocked by the corresponding peptide (at 37 °C for 2 h) in a parallel assay as a control. The labeling was performed by applying the rabbit anti-chicken horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1:3000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 1 h at room temperature. After three more washing steps with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, the immunoreactive bands were visualized using the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). cRNA Synthesis and Xenopus laevis Oocyte Injection—X. laevis oocytes (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI) of stages V and VI were isolated and defolliculated by overnight incubation at 18 °C with collagenase (Type CLSII, Biochrom KG) (0.5 mg/ml) in oocyte Ringer's solution: 90 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2,1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.6. Subsequently, they were injected with 23 nl of water (mock) or cRNA, which was synthesized from NotI-linearized pSPORT6-hOAT10 plasmid (mMessage mMachine-SP6 in vitro transcription kit; Ambion, Austin, TX), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Upon injection, the oocytes were incubated for 3 days at 18 °C in Barth's buffer (88 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.66 mm NaNO3, 0.77 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.6) containing 12 mg/liter gentamycin with daily medium changes. Transport Measurements of hOAT10 in X. laevis Oocytes—Transport experiments were carried out 3 days after injection at room temperature for the time periods indicated in oocyte Ringer's solution unless otherwise stated in the figure legends. The oocytes were then washed in ice-cold uptake buffer and dissolved in 0.25 ml of 1 n NaOH. For trans-stimulation experiments, X. laevis oocytes were injected 3 days after cRNA or water injection with two times 23 nl of 20 mm each of p-aminohippurate (PAH), succinate, glutarate, pyrazinoate, l -lactate, nicotinate, glutathione, 1 mm hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), 100 μm cyclosporine A, or oocyte Ringer's solution as a control and the uptake of 400μm (100μm [14C]uric acid with 300μm cold uric acid) uric acid was determined for 1 h at room temperature. Cell Culture and Transport Measurements—The human colon adenocarcinoma-derived intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cell line (passage 15–35; ATCC, Manassas, VA) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in plastic flasks or Petri dishes (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For transport measurements the cells were plated onto 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. Transport assays were performed on confluent cell monolayers 5–6 days after confluence in Ringer solution (130 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm HEPES, and 18 mm glucose, pH 7.4). The cells were washed twice with 500 μl of Ringer and incubated at 37 °C in Ringer containing 25 nm [3H]nicotinate and the test substances for 3 min. In all of the experiments, the 3H and 14C contents were determined after neutralization of the probes with 0.25 ml of 1 n HCl by liquid scintillation counting (Canberra-Packard, Dreieich, Germany). Kinetic and Statistical Analysis—For the determinations of the urate concentrations that blocked 50% of [3H]nicotinate uptake (IC50), the Equation 1 was used and fitted by nonlinear regression with SigmaPlot 2006 (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). v=v01+IIC50h(Eq. 1) v is the rate of [3H]nicotinate uptake in the presence of the inhibitor (urate), v0 is the rate of [3H]nicotinate uptake in the absence of the inhibitor (in this case set to 100%), I is the inhibitor concentration, and h is the Hill coefficient representing the cooperativity between the tested substances and the transporter. The hOAT10-specific uptake of [3H]nicotinate (i.e. transport in oocytes minus that observed in mock) was a saturable function of substrate concentration that was adequately described by the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 2) for competitive interaction of labeled and nonlabeled substrate (31Malo C. Berteloot A. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 122: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), J=Jmax[ ∗S]Kt+[ ∗S]+[S]+C(Eq. 2) where J is the rate of [3H]nicotinate transport from a concentration of labeled substrate equal to [*nicotinate], Jmax is the maximum rate of mediated [3H]nicotinate transport, Kt = Km is the nicotinate concentration that results in half-maximal transport (apparent Michaelis constant), [S] is the concentration of unlabeled nicotinate in the transport reaction, and C is a constant that represents the component of total nicotinate uptake that is constant (over the range of substrate concentrations tested) and presumably reflects the combined influence of diffusive flux, nonspecific binding, and/or incomplete rinsing of the cell layer. Unpaired Student's t test was used to assess differences between two groups. Statistical analysis and grafical layout were performed with Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Unterschleissheim, Germany) and SigmaPlot 2006 (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). For all of the studies an expressed sequence tag clone (GenBank™ accession number BI517655) was used, including the entire open reading frame of the orphan transporter hORCTL3 (SLC22A13), which consists of 1656 bp, coding for 551 amino acids with a homology of 44% to hOAT1. Because OAT8 and OAT9 were already mentioned in the literature without a clear definition of their sequence or relation to the SLC22 family (3Anzai N. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 100: 411-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we changed hORCTL3 to hOAT10, because of its characteristics, which are to be discussed later. A comparison of hOAT10 with all characterized members of the SLC22 family is provided in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1A), documenting that hOAT10 constitutes its own branch and exhibits only weak homologies to the other members of the SLC22 family. Further BLAST searches have explored orthologs also from the rat (XP_236685, 72% identity) and the mouse (NP_598741, 72% identity) (Fig. 1B). An examination of the tissue distribution using a panel of total RNA revealed a strong expression of the full-length hOAT10 variant in the kidneys and weaker signals in brain, heart, and colon (Fig. 2A). Additionally, we detected several splice variants of hOAT10, which we confirmed by the cloning and sequencing of additional bands visible in Fig. 2A (white arrow) and Fig. 10 below the full-length hOAT10 PCR product (white arrow), resulting mostly in a loss of exon three and of a part or all of exon 4 (data not shown). These splice variants were detected in many organs, indicating a more ubiquitous expression of hOAT10 (see Figs. 2A and 10). Real time PCR measurements in different nephron segments of female kidney defined high expression of hOAT10 in proximal convoluted tubule and interestingly also in cortical collecting duct (CCD), whereas glomerulus and thick ascending limb exhibited virtually no expression of hOAT10 (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 10Analysis of hOAT10 expression in Caco-2 cells. 1.5% agarose gel of a RT-PCR analysis of hOAT10 expression in Caco-2 cells is shown. Lane M represents the molecular mass marker, and the white arrow documents the full-length variant of hOAT10. Total RNA from male (lane 2) and female (lane 3) human kidney and hOAT10-pSPORT6 plasmid (lane 4) were used as positive controls. Lanes 5 and 6 show negative controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further prove hOAT10 localization in rat or human kidney, we raised an antibody against a conserved region, an internal loop at amino acid positions 306–319, in chicken. Several trials to document OAT10 expression in the kidney by immunohistochemistry failed (data not shown). Alternatively, we tested whether OAT10 is expressed in the apical or basolateral membrane of tubular epithelial cells using rat BLMVs and BBMVs. Western blot analysis of protein extracts of these vesicles showed a clear cut detection of a band at 55 kDa in BBMV, which was blocked by the corresponding peptide (Fig. 2C). This molecular mass of hOAT10 correlates well with the calculated protein mass of 61 kDa. No band was visible in BLMV, suggesting that renal hOAT10 expression is restricted to the apical membrane. A comparison of OAT10 expression in male and female BBMVs, loading the gel with 50 μg of protein each, showed a female over male dominance (Fig. 2C). A functional characterization of hOAT10 was explored in X. laevis oocytes. hOAT10-expressing oocytes exhibited substantial uptakes of [3H]p-aminohippurate (137.4 ± 8.8 versus 29 ± 1.6 fmol/oocyte for 30 min; Fig. 3A), [14C]urate (3.2 ± 0.2 versus 0.8 ± 0.04 pmol/oocyte for 30 min; Fig. 3B), and [3H]nicotinate (64.3 ± 4.7 versus 7.3 ± 0.6 fmol/oocyte for 30 min; Fig. 3C) each compared with mocks. Transport of [3H]nicotinate was time-dependent and reasonably linear for 60 min (data not shown); 30 min was used for all kinetic studies of nicotinate transport. hOAT10-mediated nicotinate uptake was saturable with a Michaelis constant (Km value) of 22 ± 14.1 μm (n = 3), indicating that hOAT10 is a high affinity nicotinate transporter (Fig. 4). To evaluate the affinity of hOAT10 for urate, we performed an IC50 determination with nicotinate as a substrate. The urate concentration inhibiting 50% of maximal nicotinate transport was 759 ± 501 μm, consistent with hOAT10 being a low affinity urate transporter like hOAT4 in comparison with the classical urate transporter hURAT1 (16Hagos Y. Stein D. Ugele B. Burckhardt G. Bahn A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2007; 18: 430-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5).FIGURE 4Kinetic analysis of nicotinate uptake by hOAT10.

Despite the abolishment of PAH uptake by ES, hOAT10 did not transport radioactively labeled ES (data not shown). To examine the pH dependence of hOAT10-mediated transport, we employed PAH as a substrate that does not change its charge over the applied pH ranges. Acidification of the uptake medium to pH 5.0 led to a more than 2-fold (219 ± 13.5%) increase in [3H]PAH uptake compared with the PAH uptake at pH 7.4, which was set at 100%. Alkalization of the medium to pH 8.5 resulted in a significant (p < 0.01) inhibition of PAH uptake to 63.4 ± 4.8% (Fig. 7), indicating a marked pH dependence of hOAT10. An inhibition study on hOAT10-mediated [14C]urate uptake, using 1 mm each of succinate, l -lactate, pyrazinoate, nicotinate, glutarate, and, as a control, probenecid, significantly reduced urate uptake by 22–50% (Fig. 8A). To investigate whether any of these compounds is translocated, we injected each of these substances in a concentration of 20 mm into hOAT10-expressing oocytes and measured [14C]urate uptake. We found a significant trans-stimulation of 24–39% for all substances with the exception of glutarate, suggesting that hOAT10 facilitates also urate–/PAH–, urate–/succinate2–, urate–/pyrazinoate–, urate–/l -lactate– as well as urate–/nicotinate– exchange (Fig. 8B). Next we tested the interaction of hOAT10 with several uricosurics, diuretics, and the immune suppressive agent cyclosporine A, some of which are known to cause hyperuricemia. All of the compounds reduced [3H]nicotinate uptake substantially by 33–62%, indicating that they may reduce urate or nicotinate reabsorption also in vivo (Fig. 9A). An examination of the trans-stimulatory effect of HCTZ and cyclosporine A revealed significantly enhanced urate uptake by hOAT10-expressing oocytes for cyclosporine A (164 ± 28.2). HCTZ did not change hOAT10-mediated urate uptake in comparison with the documented trans-stimulation of urate uptake by nicotinate (Fig. 9B). Additionally, we tested the trans-effect of reduced GSH on hOAT10-mediated urate uptake. We note for the first time that GSH is translocated by an OAT, namely hOAT10, driving urate uptake by a factor of more than 2 (244 ± 42%). Recently, it was documented that human intestinal vesicles as well as Caco-2 cells express a high affinity nicotinate transporter (32Nabokina S.M. Kashyap M.L. Said H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C97-C103Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We first tested the expression of hOAT10 by RT-PCR in Caco-2 cells. Using male and female total RNA of the kidney and the pSPORT6-hOAT10 plasmid as a control, we detected several splice variants of hOAT10 in Caco-2 cells, including the full-length variant that we used in this study for functional characterization (Fig. 10). An evaluation of the apparent Michaelis constant (Kt value; Equation 2) for nicotinate in Caco-2 cells, which was carried out with [3H]nicotinate at pH 5.0 for 3 min at 37 °C according to the published conditions, revealed a value of 48.4 ± 33.6 μm consistent with an involvement of hOAT10 in intestinal nicotinate uptake (Fig. 11). A re-evaluation of the tissue distribution of the orphan transporter hORCTL3 by RT-PCR revealed a strong expression in kidneys, indicating hORCTL3 to be a kidney-specific transport protein. Moreover, we found weaker expressions of different splice variants of the open reading frame of hORCTL3 especially in brain, heart, and colon, supporting the previous findings of a more general expression of hORCTL3 (25Nishiwaki T. Daigo Y. Tamari M. Fujii Y. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1998; 83: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1968683685,"Glycan structures covalently attached to proteins and lipids play numerous roles in mammalian cells, including protein folding, targeting, recognition, and adhesion at the molecular or cellular level. Regulating the abundance of glycan structures on cellular glycoproteins and glycolipids is a complex process that depends on numerous factors. Most models for glycan regulation hypothesize that transcriptional control of the enzymes involved in glycan synthesis, modification, and catabolism determines glycan abundance and diversity. However, few broad-based studies have examined correlations between glycan structures and transcripts encoding the relevant biosynthetic and catabolic enzymes. Low transcript abundance for many glycan-related genes has hampered broad-based transcript profiling for comparison with glycan structural data. In an effort to facilitate comparison with glycan structural data and to identify the molecular basis of alterations in glycan structures, we have developed a medium-throughput quantitative real time reverse transcriptase-PCR platform for the analysis of transcripts encoding glycan-related enzymes and proteins in mouse tissues and cells. The method employs a comprehensive list of >700 genes, including enzymes involved in sugar-nucleotide biosynthesis, transporters, glycan extension, modification, recognition, catabolism, and numerous glycosylated core proteins. Comparison with parallel microarray analyses indicates a significantly greater sensitivity and dynamic range for our quantitative real time reverse transcriptase-PCR approach, particularly for the numerous low abundance glycan-related enzymes. Mapping of the genes and transcript levels to their respective biosynthetic pathway steps allowed a comparison with glycan structural data and provides support for a model where many, but not all, changes in glycan abundance result from alterations in transcript expression of corresponding biosynthetic enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2136903466,"BACE1 is a promising therapeutic and preventive target for Alzheimer's disease because it is essential for amyloid deposition. However, the recent demonstration of BACE1 in modulating developmental myelination in both peripheral and central nervous systems raises a concern of its effect on myelin maintenance or remyelination, and inhibition of these processes will potentially be detrimental to the BACE1 inhibitor users who are susceptible to myelination diseases such as adult peripheral nerve injury or multiple sclerosis. In this report, we investigated the role of BACE1 during peripheral nerve remyelination in wild-type (WT) and BACE1-null mice. We show here that genetic deletion of BACE1 affects sciatic nerve remyelination. The impaired remyelination appears to stem from the loss of neuregulin-1 cleavage by BACE1. To demonstrate a direct cleavage of neuregulin-1 by BACE1, we have identified a BACE1 cleavage site that turns out be highly conserved among neuregulin-1 paralogues. Moreover, we show that neuregulin-1 family member neuregulin-3 is also cleavable by BACE1. We hypothesize that the BACE1-cleaved extracellular domain of axonal neuregulin-1, perhaps neuregulin-3 as well, binds to Schwann cell ErbB receptors, which in turn regulate remyelination. Pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 should be carefully monitored to avoid alteration of signaling pathway that regulates remyelination."
https://openalex.org/W2006358281,"Although a crystal structure and a pharmacophore model are available for cytochrome P450 2C8, the role of protein flexibility and specific ligand-protein interactions that govern substrate binding are poorly understood. X-ray crystal structures of P450 2C8 complexed with montelukast (2.8 A), troglitazone (2.7 A), felodipine (2.3 A), and 9-cis-retinoic acid (2.6 A) were determined to examine ligand-protein interactions for these chemically diverse compounds. Montelukast is a relatively large anionic inhibitor that exhibits a tripartite structure and complements the size and shape of the active-site cavity. The inhibitor troglitazone occupies the upper portion of the active-site cavity, leaving a substantial part of the cavity unoccupied. The smaller neutral felodipine molecule is sequestered with its dichlorophenyl group positioned close to the heme iron, and water molecules fill the distal portion of the cavity. The structure of the 9-cis-retinoic acid complex reveals that two substrate molecules bind simultaneously in the active site of P450 2C8. A second molecule of 9-cis-retinoic acid is located above the proximal molecule and can restrain the position of the latter for more efficient oxygenation. Solution binding studies do not discriminate between cooperative and noncooperative models for multiple substrate binding. The complexes with structurally distinct ligands further demonstrate the conformational adaptability of active site-constituting residues, especially Arg-241, that can reorient in the active-site cavity to stabilize a negatively charged functional group and define two spatially distinct binding sites for anionic moieties of substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1968858193,"HIV-1 infection dysregulates the immune system and alters gene expression in circulating monocytes. Differential gene expression analysis of CD14(+) monocytes from subjects infected with HIV-1 revealed increased expression of sialoadhesin (Sn, CD169, Siglec 1), a cell adhesion molecule first described in a subset of macrophages activated in chronic inflammatory diseases.We analyzed sialoadhesin expression on CD14(+) monocytes by flow cytometry and found significantly higher expression in subjects with elevated viral loads compared to subjects with undetectable viral loads. In cultured CD14(+) monocytes isolated from healthy individuals, sialoadhesin expression was induced by interferon-alpha and interferon-gamma but not tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Using a stringent binding assay, sialoadhesin-expressing monocytes adsorbed HIV-1 through interaction with the sialic acid residues on the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120. Furthermore, monocytes expressing sialoadhesin facilitated HIV-1 trans infection of permissive cells, which occurred in the absence of monocyte self-infection.Increased sialoadhesin expression on CD14(+) monocytes occurred in response to HIV-1 infection with maximum expression associated with high viral load. We show that interferons induce sialoadhesin in primary CD14(+) monocytes, which is consistent with an antiviral response during viremia. Our findings suggest that circulating sialoadhesin-expressing monocytes are capable of binding HIV-1 and effectively delivering virus to target cells thereby enhancing the distribution of HIV-1. Sialoadhesin could disseminate HIV-1 to viral reservoirs during monocyte immunosurveillance or migration to sites of inflammation and then facilitate HIV-1 infection of permissive cells."
https://openalex.org/W2092784915,"EWS/FLI is a master regulator of Ewing's sarcoma formation. Gene expression studies in A673 Ewing's sarcoma cells have demonstrated that EWS/FLI downregulates more genes than it upregulates, suggesting that EWS/FLI, and/or its targets, function as transcriptional repressors. One critical EWS/FLI target, NKX2.2, is a transcription factor that contains both transcriptional activation and transcriptional repression domains, raising the possibility that it mediates portions of the EWS/FLI transcriptional signature. We now report that microarray analysis demonstrated that the transcriptional profile of NKX2.2 consists solely of downregulated genes, and overlaps with the EWS/FLI downregulated signature, suggesting that NKX2.2 mediates oncogenic transformation via transcriptional repression. Structure-function analysis revealed that the DNA binding and repressor domains in NKX2.2 are required for oncogenesis in Ewing's sarcoma cells, while the transcriptional activation domain is completely dispensable. Furthermore, blockade of TLE or HDAC function, two protein families thought to mediate the repressive function of NKX2.2, inhibited the transformed phenotype and reversed the NKX2.2 transcriptional profile in Ewing's sarcoma cells. Whole genome localization studies (ChIP-chip) revealed that a significant portion of the NKX2.2-repressed gene expression signature was directly mediated by NKX2.2 binding. These data demonstrate that the transcriptional repressive function of NKX2.2 is necessary, and sufficient, for the oncogenic phenotype of Ewing's sarcoma, and suggest a therapeutic approach to this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2084793046,"Migration is a common phenomenon in many organisms, terrestrial as well as aquatic, and considerable effort has been spent to understand the evolution of migratory behaviour and its consequences for population and community dynamics. In aquatic systems, studies on migration have mainly been focused on commercially important fish species, such as salmon and trout. However, seasonal mass-migrations may occur also among other freshwater fish, e.g. in cyprinids that leave lakes and migrate into streams and wetlands in the fall and return back to the lake in spring. In a conceptual model, we hypothesized that this is an adaptive behaviour in response to seasonal changes in predation (P) and growth (G) and that migrating fish change habitat so as to minimise the ratio between predation mortality and growth rate (P/G). Estimates from bioenergetic modelling showed that seasonal changes in the ratio between predator consumption rate and prey growth rate followed the predictions from the conceptual model and also gave more precise predictions for the timing of the habitat change. By quantifying the migration of more than 1800 individually marked fish, we showed that actual migration patterns followed predictions with a remarkable accuracy, suggesting that migration patterns have evolved in response to seasonally fluctuating trade-offs between predator avoidance and foraging gains. Thus, the conceptual model provides a mechanistic understanding to mass–migration in prey fish. Further, we also show that the dominant prey fish is actually absent from the lake during a major part of the year, which should have strong implications for the dynamics of the lake ecosystem through direct and indirect food-web interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2026119866,"Carcinoma is an altered state of tissue differentiation in which epithelial cells no longer respond to cues that keep them in their proper position. A break down in these cues has disastrous consequences not only in cancer but also in embryonic development when cells of various lineages must organize into discrete entities to form a body plan. Paraxial protocadherin (PAPC) is an adhesion protein with six cadherin repeats that organizes the formation and polarity of developing cellular structures in frog, fish and mouse embryos. Here we show that protocadherin-8 (PCDH8), the human ortholog of PAPC, is inactivated through either mutation or epigenetic silencing in a high fraction of breast carcinomas. Loss of PCDH8 expression is associated with loss of heterozygosity, partial promoter methylation, and increased proliferation. Complementation of mutant tumor cell line HCC2218 with wild-type PCDH8 inhibited its growth. Two tumor mutants, E146K and R343H, were defective for inhibition of cell growth and migration. Surprisingly, the E146K mutant transformed the human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A and sustained the expression of cyclin D1 and MYC without epidermal growth factor. We propose that loss of PCDH8 promotes oncogenesis in epithelial human cancers by disrupting cell–cell communication dedicated to tissue organization and repression of mitogenic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2168456444,"The opportunistic pathogen Legionella pneumophila replicates in human lung macrophages and in free-living amoebae. To accommodate the transfer between host cells, L. pneumophila switches from a replicative to a transmissive phase. L. pneumophila harbors a gene cluster homologous to the Vibrio cholerae cqsAS quorum sensing system, encoding a putative autoinducer synthase (lqsA) and a sensor kinase (lqsS), which flank a response regulator (lqsR). LqsR is an element of the L. pneumophila virulence regulatory network, which promotes pathogen-host cell interactions and inhibits entry into the replicative growth phase. Here, we show that lqsA functionally complements a V. cholerae cqsA autoinducer synthase deletion mutant and, upon expression in L. pneumophila or Escherichia coli, produces the diffusible signaling molecule LAI-1 (Legionella autoinducer-1). LAI-1 is distinct from CAI-1 (Cholerae autoinducer-1) and was identified as 3-hydroxypentadecan-4-one using liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution tandem mass spectrometry. The activity of both LqsA and CqsA was abolished upon mutation of a conserved lysine, and covalent binding of the cofactor pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to this lysine was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Thus, LqsA and CqsA belong to a family of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent autoinducer synthases, which produce the alpha-hydroxyketone signaling molecules LAI-1 and CAI-1."

We provide evidence that decorin modulates cell-matrix interaction in this context by stimulating cytoskeletal and focal adhesion reorganization through activation of the IGF-IR and the small GTPase Rac. Further, the glycosaminoglycan moiety of decorin interacts with α2β1, but not α1β1 integrin, at a site distinct from the collagen I-binding A-domain, to allosterically modulate collagen I-binding activity of the integrin.

As a member of the small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycan family, decorin is composed of a leucine-rich repeat core protein, and a single covalently attached glycosaminoglycan chain of varying length and composition (3Iozzo R.V.

Neoangiogenesis in wounded cornea is reduced in the absence of decorin (7Schönherr E. Sunderkotter C. Schaefer L. Thanos S. Grassel S. Oldberg A. Iozzo R.V. Young M.F. Kresse H. J. Vasc.

However, investigation of whether decorin acts as a pro- or antiangiogenic factor has yielded conflicting results. In a collagen I environment, endogenous decorin enhances tube formation (10Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur.

These differences may in part depend on experimental design, including the manner in which decorin is presented, and may reflect a context-dependent response to decorin. Additionally, however, the use of denaturing agents and/or precipitation steps during isolation may compromise decorin activity, whereas differential post-translational modifications could also contribute. Of particular relevance, two studies have noted varying levels of activity of different decorin preparations in inhibiting tube formation (13Davies C.L. Melder R.J. Munn L.L. Mouta-Carreira C.

Endothelial tube formation is itself a complex process requiring extensive rearrangement of cell-matrix interactions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the role of decorin in directly regulating endothelial cell adhesion and motility.

Alternatively, decorin could inhibit cell-matrix interactions by masking integrin binding sites (17Bhide V.M. Laschinger C.A. Arora P.D. Lee W. Hakkinen L. Larjava H. Sodek J. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol.

Although these mechanisms would certainly be expected to contribute to modulation of tube formation by decorin, direct interactions of decorin with cell surface receptors could play an essential role in this process. For example, we have shown that decorin core protein signals through the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) in endothelial cells (18Schönherr E. Sunderkotter C. Iozzo R.V. Schaefer L. J.

Moreover, IGF-IR activation modulates motility in endothelial and other cells by influencing integrin affinity for their matrix ligands (19Clemmons D.R. Maile L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Liu W. Liu Y. Lowe Jr., W.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1710-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21Lynch L. Vodyanik P.I. Boettiger D. Guvakova M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 51-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Decorin has also been reported to support platelet adhesion via interaction with the collagen I binding integrin α2β1 (22Guidetti G. Bertoni A. Viola M. Tira E. Balduini C. Torti M. Blood. 2002; 100: 1707-1714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction could also be relevant for control of endothelial cell behavior by decorin, since α2β1 integrin activity critically modulates endothelial cell motility and capillary morphogenesis in a collagen I environment (23Sweeney S.M. DiLullo G. Slater S.J. Martinez J. Iozzo R.V. Lauer-Fields J.L. Fields G.B. San Antonio J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30516-30524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Coordinated signals from the extracellular matrix via integrins and from growth factors to their receptors control endothelial cell motility and angiogenic morphogenesis. We therefore hypothesized that the mechanism(s) by which decorin regulates endothelial cell motility could involve direct activation of IGF-I receptor and/or α2β1 integrin on endothelial cells. In this study, we investigated whether activation of these receptors is involved in modulation of endothelial cell motility by decorin. Protein Production—Decorin was purified from conditioned medium of human skin fibroblasts without denaturing and/or precipitation steps using anion exchange chromatography (DEAE-Sepharose) essentially as described (24Glossl J. Beck M. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14144-14150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Decorin-containing fractions were then applied to a Resource Q-15 column (Amersham Biosciences), washed with 0.7 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and eluted with 1 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Decorin was dialyzed into PBS and concentrated to >0.5 mg/ml by ultrafiltration (Centriprep YM-10; Amicon) to preserve activity (25Winnemoller M. Schmidt G. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 54: 10-17PubMed Google Scholar), aliquoted, and stored at -20 °C. Decorin core protein was obtained by digestion with chondroitin ABC lyase (Seikagaku Fine Biochemicals), at 0.2 milliunits enzyme/μg of decorin in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.03 m sodium acetate, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 2 h, followed by purification on DEAE-Trisacryl M (Serva) as described (26Blochberger T.C. Cornuet P.K. Hassell J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20613-20619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Decorin proteoglycan and core protein purity was checked by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Immunoreactivity was confirmed using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum to human decorin, 1:500 (27Hausser H. Ober B. Quentin-Hoffmann E. Schmidt B. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11559-11564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 90-kDa core protein complex immunoreactive with decorin antibodies yielded exclusively sequences consistent with decorin as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry (Cardiff University Services Facility). 5G.

Soluble human integrins α2β1 and α1β1 and GST-α2A-domain fusion protein were recombinantly produced and isolated as described (29Eble J.A. Beermann B. Hinz H.-J. Schmidt-Hederich A. J. Biol.

Dermatan sulfate (porcine skin, 90% l-iduronic acid, 10% chondroitin 4/6-sulfate) was obtained from Sigma and dissolved in double-distilled water at 1 mg/ml. Integrin-modulating monoclonal antibodies JA221 and 9EG7 were produced as described (30Eble J.A. Tuckwell D.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).

Cell Culture—The human endothelial cell line EA.hy926 (31Edgell C.-J.S. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar) was propagated in MCDB 131 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 μm hypoxanthine, 0.4 μm aminopterin, 16 μm thymidine (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For experiments, cells were seeded on a fibrillar collagen I substrate and cultured in Waymouth MAB 87/3 medium supplemented with antibiotics and 0.5% heat-inactivated FCS for a minimum of 24 h. Collagen gels were prepared by coating hydrophilic culture dishes with acid-extracted rat tail tendon collagen immediately following neutralization with serum-free medium/NaOH as described (10Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Where indicated, decorin (0.1–0.6 μm) was immediately mixed into the gels prior to setting. Where required, cells were treated with 10 μm tyrphostin AG1024 (10 mm stock in DMSO; Alexis) for 1 h prior to stimulation. Cell Migration Assay—A migration assay based on the work of Korff and Augustin (32Korff T. Augustin H.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1341-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) was developed. Briefly, uniform spheroids were generated by incubating 1,000 EA.hy926 cells/well in hydrophobic 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-one) in Waymouth MAB 87/3 medium supplemented with 5% FCS, antibiotics, and 30% (v/v) methyl-cellulose (from filtered stock solution of 1.3 g/ml methyl-cellulose (Sigma) in Waymouth medium) for 48 h. Spheroids were removed using a stripette and collected by centrifugation at 725 × g for 2 min, washed with serum-free medium, and resuspended in medium supplemented with 0.5% heat-inactivated FCS and antibiotics to a volume of 100 μl/spheroid. A 100-μl suspension was transferred per well of a 96-well plate containing 50 μl of fibrillar collagen I or mixed decorin-collagen I gels. Wells were inspected microscopically, and those containing a single spheroid located close to the center of the well were selected for analysis. Plates were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2, and migration was recorded by capturing phase-contrast images at time of plating and every 24 h thereafter for 5 days. Radial outgrowth was determined from diameter measurements (n = 10). Cell Attachment Assay—Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in serum-free medium, and 15,000 cells/well were seeded into a 96-well tissue culture plate containing collagen I or mixed decorin-collagen gels. Where required, cells were mixed with soluble decorin immediately prior to seeding. Cells were allowed to adhere for the indicated times at 37 °C and washed in PBS. Adherent cells were quantified using crystal violet staining as previously described (33Stephens P. Grenard P. Aeschlimann P. Langley M. Blain E. Errington R. Kipling D. Thomas D. Aeschlimann D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3389-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—Cells were seeded in serum-free medium at 100,000/well of a 24-well plate onto glass coverslips coated with fibrillar collagen I or mixed decorin-collagen gels. After incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for the indicated time period, adherent cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% BSA/PBS. F-actin was visualized by staining with 1 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) and focal adhesions with antibodies against vinculin (6 μg/ml mAb VIN-11-5; Sigma), detected with TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:100; ICN/Cappel). FAK Signaling—Adherent cells (5 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) were cultured on collagen I gels under low serum conditions (0.5% FCS) for 48 h prior to stimulation. Alternatively, trypsinized cells (1 × 106 cells/well of a 24-well plate) were seeded in serum-free medium onto fibrillar collagen I gels in the absence or presence of decorin or onto mixed decorin-collagen I gels. At the indicated times, protein extracts were prepared as previously described (33Stephens P. Grenard P. Aeschlimann P. Langley M. Blain E. Errington R. Kipling D. Thomas D. Aeschlimann D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3389-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein, as determined by BCA assay (Pierce), were separated on 4–12% SDS-PAGE BisTris gels (Invitrogen) under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran; Whatman). After blocking with TBS containing 5% nonfat dried milk and 0.1% Tween 20, membranes were probed with antibodies to Tyr(P)397 FAK (0.5 μg/ml; Calbiochem), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies to rabbit IgG (1:2000; DakoCytomation) in 1% nonfat dried milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS for 1 h each at room temperature. Membranes were washed between incubations and prior to development in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and developed with Supersignal ECL reagent. As a control for equal loading, membranes were probed for β-tubulin (TUB2.1, 1:500; Sigma), detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies to mouse IgG (1:2000, DakoCytomation), or stripped (60 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.7% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS for 30 min at 50 °C) and reprobed with antibodies to FAK (1:100, PC314; Oncogene). GTPase Assays—Adherent cells (3 × 106 cells/10-cm dish) cultured on fibrillar collagen I gels were serum-starved for 24 h prior to stimulation with 0.7 μm decorin. At the indicated times, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer supplied with the Rac activation assay kit (Cytoskeleton Inc.) per dish. The active form of the small GTPases was captured from 1 ml of cell lysate at 700 μg/ml protein using GST-tagged PAK-PBD beads as specified by the manufacturer, and Rac-1 was detected by immunoblotting. Alternatively, active Rac-1 was quantified using the G-LISA™ Rac activation assay kit (Cytoskeleton Inc.) as specified by the manufacturer. Briefly, 3.5 × 105 cells/35-mm dish were cultured on collagen I gels, serum-starved for 24 h, and pretreated with inhibitors for 1 h prior to stimulation with 0.7 μm decorin for 15 min. Integrin Binding Studies—Microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 30 μg/ml decorin, 12.5 μg/ml FC3 peptide in PBS, or 10 μg/ml collagen I in 0.1 m acetic acid. After washing with TBS (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 2 mm MgCl2 (TBS/Mg), nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% BSA in the same buffer (blocking buffer). Integrins were diluted in blocking buffer containing 1 mm MnCl2, unless otherwise indicated, and mixed with additives or competitors at specified concentrations immediately prior to plating. For analysis of pH dependence, ampholines (pH 4–10; Amersham Biosciences) at 40 mg/ml were used as buffering agents. The integrin solution was incubated with immobilized substrates for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, bound integrin was chemically fixed and quantified by ELISA using a rabbit antiserum against the β1 subunit (1:600) as described (30Eble J.A. Tuckwell D.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Experiments with GST-integrin α2A-domain followed the same procedure, and binding was detected using polyclonal rabbit antibodies to the GST moiety (Molecular Probes) (30Eble J.A. Tuckwell D.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Statistics—Statistical significance within matched groups was assessed using repeated measures analysis of variance and Dunnett multiple comparison test with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.005). Decorin Enhances α2β1 Integrin-dependent Endothelial Cell Adhesion and Migration on Fibrillar Collagen I—To investigate decorin effects on endothelial cell motility during sprout formation from preexisting vessels, we adapted a three-dimensional spheroid model. This system has established cell-cell contacts and mimics the quiescent endothelial cell phenotype (32Korff T. Augustin H.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1341-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Transferring spheroids onto the surface of fibrillar collagen I gels induced radial outward migration of endothelial cells (Fig. 1A). Decorin, as a soluble medium supplement (as a model for endothelial cell-secreted decorin), enhanced this process and promoted formation of elongated, sproutlike extensions (Fig. 1A), an effect that was dose-dependent (Fig. 1B). Enhanced proliferation did not appear to contribute significantly to this observation, since migration was conducted in low serum (0.5% FCS) and reached a plateau at extended time points (data not shown), indicating the presence of a finite cell population. Further, decorin does not appear to modulate endothelial cell proliferation (15Sulochana K.N. Fan H. Jois S. Subramanian V. Sun F. Kini R.M. Ge R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27935-27948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16Kinsella M.G. Fischer J.W. Mason D.P. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13924-13932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To delineate the mechanism of endothelial cell motility in our system, we used rhodocetin, a specific inhibitor of the major collagen I-binding integrin, α2β1. Rhodocetin reduced outward migration of endothelial cells from spheroids in a dose-dependent manner, and cells adopted a rounded morphology (Fig. 1, A and C), indicating that motility was, at least in part, mediated by α2β1 integrin. Since decorin deposited by fibroblasts regulates collagen I fibrillogenesis, it could affect α2β1 integrin-mediated cell-collagen I interactions by altering the supramolecular structure of collagen aggregates. To test this hypothesis, collagen was polymerized in the presence of decorin. Under these conditions, endothelial cell migration was also enhanced (Fig. 1D). Alternatively, since decorin has been reported to support platelet adhesion by direct interactions with α2β1 integrin (22Guidetti G. Bertoni A. Viola M. Tira E. Balduini C. Torti M. Blood. 2002; 100: 1707-1714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), decorin-containing substrates could similarly support endothelial cell attachment and migration. By itself, however, decorin failed to support endothelial cell attachment (Fig. 2A). Rhodocetin inhibited adhesion to collagen I (Fig. 2A), indicating that adhesion was mediated, at least in part, by α2β1 integrin. In contrast, decorin promoted endothelial cell attachment to collagen I when presented either as a medium supplement or in a collagen-bound form (Fig. 2A). Enhancement of adhesion by both soluble and collagen-bound decorin was dose-dependent and was apparent up to at least 3 h after seeding (Fig. 2B and data not shown). To investigate which moiety of decorin was involved in enhancing adhesion, endothelial cells were seeded onto collagen gels in the presence of either decorin core protein or glycosaminoglycan alone or onto collagen gels that had been prepared in the presence of these moieties. Neither moiety of decorin by itself had any similar effect, indicating that the intact proteoglycan is required to enhance adhesion to collagen I (supplemental Fig. 1). These data demonstrate that decorin, irrespective of its presentation as either a soluble factor or in association with collagen I fibrils, influences the cellular interactions with collagen and that α2β1 integrin plays a central role in this system.FIGURE 2Decorin promotes endothelial cell adhesion to fibrillar collagen I. Endothelial cell adhesion was quantified by crystal violet staining of adherent cells 1 h after seeding. The mean ± S.E. of five replicate samples is shown, and statistical significance is indicated as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.005 compared with unstimulated cells. Cells were seeded onto wells coated with BSA, decorin (Dcn; 0.3 μm), collagen I gels containing decorin (Dcn-Col I; 0.5 μm decorin), or collagen I gels (Col I) in medium supplemented with 0.5 μm decorin or 0.15 μm rhodocetin or without supplements (untreated, A). Phase-contrast images of cells adhering to collagen I gels or decorin (0.3 μm) 1 h after seeding are shown as an inset in A. In B, cells were seeded in the presence of decorin as a medium supplement for the indicated times and concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Decorin Induces a Motile Phenotype by Activating IGF-IR and the Small GTPase Rac—To further delineate decorin effects on motility, the cellular phenotype induced by decorin during adhesion to fibrillar collagen I was investigated. In cells adhering to collagen I alone, mature focal adhesions associated with actin stress fibers were formed within 1 h (Fig. 3, A–C, Col I, arrows). In contrast, when cells were seeded onto collagen gels in the presence of soluble decorin or onto collagen-bound decorin, large vinculin-positive focal complexes (Fig. 3, A–C, Dcn and Dcn-Col I, arrows), ruffles, and microspike-like structures (Fig. 3, A–D, Dcn and Dcn-Col I, arrowheads) were frequently observed at the periphery of cells. In a manner reminiscent of these morphological changes, activation of the small GTPase Rac-1 induces membrane ruffling and formation of peripheral focal complexes (34Rottner K. Hall A. Small J.V. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 640-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether decorin induces Rac activation. Indeed, Rac activation occurred within 15 min of incubation of decorin with adherent cells (Fig. 3E). Since we have shown that decorin can activate IGF-IR signaling pathways in these cells (18Schönherr E. Sunderkotter C. Iozzo R.V. Schaefer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15767-15772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), we investigated whether Rac activation by decorin involved signaling through this receptor. To this end, serum-starved endothelial cells were treated with AG1024, an inhibitor of IGF-IR, or vehicle (DMSO) for 1 h prior to stimulation with decorin. Decorin enhanced levels of active Rac 1.3-fold but could not stimulate Rac activity when IGF-IR activation was blocked (Fig. 3F). To ascertain whether activation of IGF-IR by decorin was therefore responsible for enhanced motility, endothelial cell spheroids migrating on collagen I were treated with AG1024 prior to the addition of decorin. Under these conditions, decorin did not promote endothelial cell migration from spheroids (Fig. 4A). Similarly, blocking IGF-IR a"

Thus, mechanisms that control cys-LT-dependent biologic responses are of considerable pathobiologic and clinical interest in both allergic and nonallergic disease. CysLT1R and CysLT2R are the two known G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) selective for cys-LTs (21Heise C.E. O'Dowd B.F. Figueroa D.J. Sawyer N. Nguyen T. Im D.S. Stocco R. Bellefeuille J.N.

LTE4 is a weak, partial agonist for CysLT1R and CysLT2R, binding each with 1–2-log fold lower affinity than do LTC4 and LTD4 (21Heise C.E. O'Dowd B.F. Figueroa D.J. Sawyer N. Nguyen T. Im D.S.

J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 164: 1495-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), LTE4 nonetheless elicits biologic responses than are distinct from those induced by its precursors. After inhalation by human subjects, LTE4 (but not LTD4) causes significant increases in the numbers of eosinophils, basophils, and MCs in sputum over several hours (25Gauvreau G.M. Parameswaran K.N.

Lancet. 1993; 341: 989-990Abstract PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Humans with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), a variant of asthma characterized by markedly elevated baseline generation of cys-LTs, exhibit bronchoconstrictor responses to inhaled LTE4 that are disproportionate relative to their responses to histamine (27Arm J.P. O'Hickey S.P. Hawksworth R.J. Fong C.Y. Crea A.E. Spur B.W. Lee T.H. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1990; 142: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), LTC4, or LTD4 (28Christie P.E. Schmitz-Schumann M. Spur B.W. Lee T.H. Eur. Respir. J. 1993; 6: 1468-1473PubMed Google Scholar). Prior inhalation of LTE4 by humans with asthma potentiates AHR to histamine; this response can be blocked by pretreatment of the subjects with the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin (29O'Hickey S.P. Hawksworth R.J. Fong C.Y. Arm J.P. Spur B.W. Lee T.H. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991; 144: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Likewise, LTE4 (but not LTC4 or LTD4) potentiates contraction of guinea pig tracheal rings to histamine in an indomethacin-sensitive fashion (30Lee T.H. Austen K.F. Corey E.J. Drazen J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4922-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, LTE4-induced pulmonary responses in vivo are dissimilar to those caused by LTC4 and LTD4, are not explained by the pharmacology of the established GPCRs for cys-LTs, and may be mediated by induced prostanoids. MCs are stem cell factor (SCF)-dependent hematopoietic cells that are ubiquitously distributed at interfaces with the external environment (reviewed in Ref. 31Gurish M.F. Boyce J.A. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2006; 117: 1285-1291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 32Wedemeyer J. Tsai M. Galli S.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and abound in human airways. MCs trigger exacerbations of asthma through the elaboration of soluble mediators. Among these are especially large quantities of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), a COX product that is a bronchoconstrictor and chemoattractant for eosinophils, basophils, and Th2 cells. MCs express both CysLT1R and CysLT2R (33Mellor E.A. Frank N. Soler D. Hodge M.R. Lora J.M. Austen K.F. Boyce J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blood. 2007; 110: 3263-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Stimulation of primary human MCs derived in vitro from cord blood progenitors (hMCs) with LTD4 potently induces calcium flux (32Wedemeyer J. Tsai M. Galli S.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, and cytokine generation (36Mellor E.A. Austen K.F. Boyce J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Based on RNA interference and/or pharmacologic antagonism with MK571, a drug that blocks CysLT1R but not CysLT2R, each of these responses requires CysLT1R. In a model of allergen-induced pulmonary inflammation, LTC4S–/– mice showed a striking deficit in the number of MCs in the tracheal epithelium (20Kim D.C. Hsu F.I. Barrett N.A. Friend D.S. Grenningloh R. Ho I.C. Al-Garawi A. Lora J.M. Lam B.K. Austen K.F. Kanaoka Y. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 4440-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In a separate study, exogenous LTD4 induced the proliferation of hMCs by causing transactivation of c-Kit, the receptor for SCF, through CysLT1R (37Jiang Y. Kanaoka Y. Feng C. Nocka K. Rao S. Boyce J.A. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 2755-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), while CysLT2R counter-regulates these responses (35Jiang Y. Borrelli L.A. Kanaoka Y. Bacskai B.J. Boyce J.A. Blood. 2007; 110: 3263-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, despite its weak activity at CysLT1R and CysLT2R, LTE4 increased the numbers of MCs arising from liquid culture of cord blood mononuclear cells more potently than LTC4 or LTD4 (37Jiang Y. Kanaoka Y. Feng C. Nocka K. Rao S. Boyce J.A. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 2755-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We now report that LTE4 signals though a distinct, MK571-sensitive pathway independent of CysLT1R and CysLT2R, thereby linking extracellular LTE4 to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)-dependent ERK activation, inducible expression of COX-2, and generation of PGD2. These findings support the possible existence of a LTE4-activated GPCR that accounts for the distinct effects of LTE4in vivo. Reagents—LTD4, LTE4, PGJ2, GW9662, NS398, MK571, and anti-COX-2 and PPARγ Abs were purchased from Cayman Chemical. Fura-2 AM was from Molecular Probes, and all primers were from SuperArray. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 and all phosphospecific Abs were from Cell Signaling. A second PPARγ Ab was from UBI. The siRNA for PPARγ was from Dharmacon, pertussis toxin (PTX) was from Sigma, and PD98059 was from Chemicon. Cell Culture—The LAD2 line (38Kirshenbaum A.S. Akin C. Wu Y. Rottem M. Goff J.P. Beaven M.A. Rao V.K. Metcalfe D.D. Leuk. Res. 2003; 27: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) isolated from the bone marrow of a patient with MC leukemia was a kind gift of Dr. Arnold Kirshenbaum (NIH). These cells were cultured in Stem-pro 34™ (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), Pen-strep (100 international units/ml) (Invitrogen), and SCF (Endogen) (100 ng/ml). Cell culture medium was hemi-depleted every week with fresh medium and 100 ng/ml SCF. Primary hMCs were derived from cord blood mononuclear cells cultured for 6–9 weeks in RPMI supplemented with SCF, interleukin IL-6, and IL-10 (39Ochi H. Hirani W.M. Yuan Q. Friend D. Austen K.F. Boyce J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Calcium Flux—LAD2 cells (0.5–1 × 106/sample) were washed and labeled with fura 2-AM for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, and changes in intracellular calcium concentration were measured using excitation at 340 and 380 nm in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-4500) (34Mellor E.A. Maekawa A. Austen K.F. Boyce J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7964-7969Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The relative ratios of fluorescence emitted at 510 nm were recorded and displayed as a reflection of intracellular calcium concentration. In some experiments, cells were preincubated with the CysLT1R antagonist MK571 (1 μm) for 5 min before the stimulation. Flow Cytometry—The expressions of Kit, CysLT1R, CysLT2R, GPR17, and PPARγ in LAD2 cells were determined by flow cytometry. Briefly, LAD2 cells (2 × 105) were washed in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and incubated with mouse anti-human IgG1 against Kit (BIOSOURCE International) or with custom-generated Abs against extracellular domains of the human CysLT1R (RB34) (35Jiang Y. Borrelli L.A. Kanaoka Y. Bacskai B.J. Boyce J.A. Blood. 2007; 110: 3263-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and CysLT2R (RB19) (Orbigen). In some experiments, polyclonal Abs against the C termini of human CysLT1R and CysLT2R (Cayman) were used. For experiments with the latter Abs, as well as those used to detect intracellular PPARγ, the cells were permeabilized with 0.5% saponin before staining, followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary Ab for another 30 min. Staining for GPR17 was done using a polyclonal Ab raised against the extracellular N terminus (Novus) with and without permeabilization. Nonspecific rabbit IgG and mouse IgG1 (BioSource International) were used as respective negative controls. Cells were washed with FACS buffer three times, and flow cytometric analyses were performed with a Becton-Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. Real-time Quantitative PCR—The expressions of CysLT1R, CysLT2R, macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β), MCP-1, IL-5, IL-8, COX-1, COX-2, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (groups IIA, IVA, V, and X), hematopoietic PGD2 synthase (PGDS), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) mRNAs were determined with real-time PCR performed on an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). LAD2 cells were growth factor-starved overnight and stimulated with LTD4 or LTE4 (100 nm) or with medium alone for 2 h at 37 °C. RNA was isolated with an RNAeasy minikit (Qiagen) and was treated with RNase-free DNase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μgof RNA with Superscript II RNase H-RT (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription (RT) was performed using TaqMan RT reagents. All primers and FAM-labeled PCR mix were purchased from Superarray. Short Hairpin RNA (shRNA) and Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Knockdowns—shRNA constructs targeting human CysLT1R and CysLT2R were purchased from Open Biosystems. The constructs were cloned into a lentiviral vector (pLKo1, Open Biosystems) and used to generate infectious particles with a lentiviral packaging mix (Virapower, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The transfections were carried out as described previously (35Jiang Y. Borrelli L.A. Kanaoka Y. Bacskai B.J. Boyce J.A. Blood. 2007; 110: 3263-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). FACs analysis was used to confirm the knockdowns. siRNA against PPARγ and scrambled double-stranded RNA controls were purchased from Dharmacon in the form of a SMART pool. Cells were transfected with 50 nm PPARγ and scrambled siRNAs using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 48 h, knockdowns were confirmed by Western blotting, and the cells were used for the indicated assays. Cell Activation—LAD2 cells and primary hMCs either were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of LTD4 or LTE4 or were passively sensitized with human myeloma IgE (2 μg/ml; Chemicon) overnight and stimulated with rabbit anti-human anti-IgE (Chemicon, 1 μg/ml), SCF (100 ng/ml), PGJ2 (20 μg/ml), or rosiglitazone (10 μm), a PPARγ agonist. To determine the contribution of various signaling events in agonist-mediated responses, cells were stimulated after preincubation with PTX (100 ng/ml) for 18 h; with the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 (10 μm) for 1 h; or with MK571 (1 μm), the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98058 (50 μm), the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 μm), the cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) inhibitor Shinogi 1 (5 μm), or the COX-2 inhibitor NS398 (10 μm) for 30 min. Cells were stimulated with the agonists for 15 min for ERK phosphorylation, 2 h for PCR analysis, 6 h for the measurement of cytokine and PGD2 generation, and 18 h for the PPARγ ligand-binding domain (LBD) assay (40Zarini S. Gijon M.A. Folco G. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10134-10146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The concentration of MIP-1β was measured by an ELISA (Endogen). PGD2 was detected using a PGD2-methoxylamine hydrochloride (PGD2-MOX) assay (Cayman). The PGD2 values detected with this assay were similar to those identified in the supernatants of cys-LT-stimulated primary hMCs and LAD2 cells by metabolite separation and analysis by reversed-phase HPLC and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (40Zarini S. Gijon M.A. Folco G. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10134-10146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cell Lysates and Western Blotting—After stimulation with the respective agonists, LAD2 cells and primary hMCs (0.5 × 106) were lysed with lysis buffer (BD Bioscience) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and sodium vanadate (1 mm). Lysates were subjected to 4–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated with Abs against phospho- and total ERK, MEK, 90 kDa ribosomal s6 kinase (p90RSK), and cyclic AMP-regulated-binding protein (CREB) (Cell Signaling Technologies) in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 5% dry milk, 0.1% Tween-20 (1:1000) overnight at 4 °C on shaker, and then with secondary Ab (peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse). Bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). PPARγ LBD Assay—Bovine aortic endothelial cells, and CHO cells stably transfected with human CysLT1R or CysLT2R were plated in 24-well plates and transiently transfected in 1% delipidated plasma (DLP)/DMEM per the manufacturer's instructions (Fugene HD, Roche Applied Science). Briefly, cells were co-transfected with constructs for the human PPARγ-LBD GAL4 fusion, the GAL4-responsive luciferase reporter pUASX4TK-luc, and β-galactosidase. Cells were stimulated with the indicated reagents for 18–24 h before the PPARγ LBD-GAL4 assays were performed. Luciferase counts, normalized to β-galactosidase activity, were obtained using luciferase substrates (BD Pharmingen); chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside was used for β-galactosidase activity assays (Roche Diagnostics) (41Ziouzenkova O. Perrey S. Asatryan L. Hwang J. MacNaul K.L. Moller D.E. Rader D.J. Sevanian A. Zechner R. Hoefler G. Plutzky J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2730-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Cell Proliferation—Mitogenic assays were performed in triplicate on cells suspended in fresh medium at a concentration of 0.5 × 106/ml with or without LTD4 and LTE4 (0.01–0.1 μm) in the absence of SCF. In some experiments, MK571 (1 μm) or GW9662 (10 μm) was added at the same time as the mitogens. At 48 h, the cells were pulsed overnight with [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences), and counts were analyzed by β-counting. The radioactivity incorporated was measured in triplicate, and the results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistics—Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. from at least three experiments except where otherwise indicated. Data were converted to a percentage of control for each experiment where indicated. The significance was determined with the Student's t test. Rank Order of cys-LTs for Inducing Calcium Flux in LAD2 Cells—To determine the potency of LTE4 for calcium flux relative to the other cys-LTs, we stimulated Fura-2-loaded LAD2 cells with various doses of each cys-LT and performed cross-desensitizations. LTD4 was the most potent agonist among the cys-LTs for eliciting calcium flux and completely desensitized the LAD2 cells to the calcium fluxes induced by both LTC4 and LTE4 (Fig. 1A). LTE4 caused calcium flux at doses as low as 1 nm that was not attenuated by prior stimulation of the cells with an equal amount of LTC4. LTC4 did not induce a calcium flux at concentrations below 100 nm. LTE4 partly desensitized LAD2 cells to LTD4 and completely desensitized these cells to LTC4 (Fig. 1B). Regardless of the cys-LT used to stimulate the LAD2 cells, the calcium responses were totally blocked by pretreatment of the cells with MK571 (Fig. 1B), which competitively antagonizes CysLT1R but not CysLT2R. Thus, although LAD2 cells express CysLT2R mRNA (Fig. 1C) and protein (Fig. 1D), all cys-LT-induced calcium flux in these cells is mediated by MK571-sensitive receptors. GPR17 was detected intracellularly but not on the surfaces of the LAD2 cells. cys-LT-mediated Proliferation and Kit Internalization—We compared the effects of LTD4 with those of LTE4 for inducing proliferation of LAD2 cells. Unlike primary hMCs, LAD2 cells do not depend on exogenous SCF for their survival (38Kirshenbaum A.S. Akin C. Wu Y. Rottem M. Goff J.P. Beaven M.A. Rao V.K. Metcalfe D.D. Leuk.

https://openalex.org/W1983606789,"The CXCR3 chemokine receptor regulates the migration of Th1 lymphocytes and responds to three ligands: CXCL9/MIG, CXCL10/IP-10, and CXCL11/I-TAC. We screened for potential regulation of T cell responses by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) processing of these important chemokines. The most potent of the CXCR3 ligands, CXCL11, was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry as a substrate of the PMN-specific MMP-8, macrophage-specific MMP-12, and the general leukocyte MMP-9. The 73-amino acid residue CXCL11 is processed at both the amino and carboxyl termini to generate CXCL11-(5–73), -(5–63), and -(5–58) forms. NH2-terminal truncation results in loss of agonistic properties, as shown in calcium mobilization and chemotaxis experiments using CXCR3 transfectants and human T lymphocytes. Moreover, CXCL11-(5–73) is a CXCR3 antagonist and interestingly shows enhanced affinity to heparin. However, upon COOH-terminal truncation to position 58 there is loss of antagonist activity and heparin binding. Together this highlights an unexpected site for receptor interaction and that the carboxyl terminus is critical for glycosaminoglycan binding, an essential function for the formation of chemokine gradients in vivo. Hence, MMP activity might regulate CXCL11 tissue gradients in two ways. First, the potential of CXCL11-(5–73) to compete active CXCL11 from glycosaminoglycans might lead to the formation of an antagonistic haptotactic chemokine gradient. Second, upon further truncation, MMPs disperse the CXCL11 gradients in a novel way by proteolytic loss of a COOH-terminal GAG binding site. Hence, these results reveal potential new roles in down-regulating Th1 lymphocyte chemoattraction through MMP processing of CXCL11. The CXCR3 chemokine receptor regulates the migration of Th1 lymphocytes and responds to three ligands: CXCL9/MIG, CXCL10/IP-10, and CXCL11/I-TAC.

The 73-amino acid residue CXCL11 is processed at both the amino and carboxyl termini to generate CXCL11-(5–73), -(5–63), and -(5–58) forms. NH2-terminal truncation results in loss of agonistic properties, as shown in calcium mobilization and chemotaxis experiments using CXCR3 transfectants and human T lymphocytes. Moreover, CXCL11-(5–73) is a CXCR3 antagonist and interestingly shows enhanced affinity to heparin. However, upon COOH-terminal truncation to position 58 there is loss of antagonist activity and heparin binding. Together this highlights an unexpected site for receptor interaction and that the carboxyl terminus is critical for glycosaminoglycan binding, an essential function for the formation of chemokine gradients in vivo. Hence, MMP activity might regulate CXCL11 tissue gradients in two ways. First, the potential of CXCL11-(5–73) to compete active CXCL11 from glycosaminoglycans might lead to the formation of an antagonistic haptotactic chemokine gradient. Second, upon further truncation, MMPs disperse the CXCL11 gradients in a novel way by proteolytic loss of a COOH-terminal GAG binding site. Hence, these results reveal potential new roles in down-regulating Th1 lymphocyte chemoattraction through MMP processing of CXCL11. Chemokines are a superfamily of low molecular weight chemotactic cytokines that function in directing the migration of leukocytes and other cell types in a multitude of processes including development, lymphocyte homing, inflammation, and wound repair (1Moser B. Wolf M. Walz A. Loetscher P. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Chemokines form haptotactic gradients in vivo through associations with proteoglycan glycosaminoglycans (2Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Crown S.E. Lau E.K. Proudfoot A.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 385-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Upon interaction with 7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors, chemokines induce a chemotactic response. The expression and secretion of inducible chemokines is stimulated during infection or injury to promote rapid and efficient inflammatory and immune responses. Conversely, dampening of inflammation, a critical event in allowing tissue repair to continue unimpeded and in preventing excessive tissue damage and autoimmunity, is known to involve coordinated down-regulation of chemokine expression (3Hamilton T.A.

MMPs are zinc-dependent extracellular endopeptidases, with most having a carboxyl-terminal hemopexin domain containing exosites for substrate binding (30Overall C.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 2002; 22: 51-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MMPs are up-regulated in many pathologies including rheumatoid arthritis (31Burrage P.S. Mix K.S. Brinckerhoff C.E. Front.

Cancer. 2006; 6: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar), all of which have a chronic inflammatory component. The expression of numerous MMPs by immune cells is commonly thought to promote cellular migration through extracellular matrix degradation and hence removal of physical barriers (23Page-McCaw A. Ewald A.J. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). However, this concept is outmoded following T lymphocyte migration studies in three-dimensional extracellular matrices in the presence of potent protease inhibitors (35Wolf K. Muller R. Borgmann S. Brocker E.B. Friedl P. Blood. 2003; 102: 3262-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), MMP-8 knock-out mice, where deficiency in this neutrophil collagenase did not reduce PMN cell migration in response to activated chemokines in vitro and in vivo (25Tester A.M.

Interestingly, MMPs are produced by cells of both the innate and adaptive arms of immunity, suggesting pleiotropic roles coordinating rapid host defense and more specific or specialized acquired immunity. Examples include the neutrophil-specific MMP-8, the macrophage-specific MMP-12 (also known as metalloelastase), and MMP-9 (also known as gelatinase B), which is expressed by a variety of leukocytes. Interstitial collagenase (MMP-1) and MMP-7 (also known as matrilysin), an endothelial and epithelial-derived protease, are also expressed by macrophages (20Parks W.C. Wilson C.L. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). CD4+ T helper lymphocytes (Th1) are involved in managing humoral and cell-mediated responses through cytokine release and subsequent activation of effector cells. Notably, the gelatinases MMP-2 (also known as gelatinase A) and MMP-9 are preferentially expressed by the Th1 subset and CD4+ migration is reduced in the presence of MMP inhibitors (38Abraham M. Shapiro S. Karni A. Weiner H.L. Miller A. J. Neuroimmun. 2005; 163: 157-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, membrane type-1 MMP (MMP-14) is the major physiological activator of MMP-2 (39Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17119-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) and is expressed by monocytes and dendritic cells (40Matias-Roman S. Galvez B.G. Genis L.

Deng B.P. Ko K.H. Lu L. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2006; 84: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The CXCR3 chemokine receptor is preferentially expressed on Th1 cells and has three known ligands: CXCL9/MIG, CXCL10/IP-10, and CXCL11/I-TAC. These chemokines are induced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-γ in several cell types including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, T cells, astrocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (1Moser B. Wolf M. Walz A. Loetscher P. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). The CXCR3 receptor and its cognate chemokines have been implicated in inflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and allograft rejection, as they are up-regulated in these pathological states, presumably causing enhanced infiltration of CXCR3-expressing Th1 cells (42Gerard C. Rollins B.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar, 43Hancock W.W. Wang L. Ye Q. Han R. Lee I. Curr. Opin.

Frederiksen J.L. Ransohoff R.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 807-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). As such, precise regulation of the CXCR3 ligands is key in preventing excessive Th1 recruitment and the resulting pathology. Previous reports have shown that CXCL10 is cleaved at the carboxyl terminus by furin in the cellular context (45Hensbergen P.J. Verzijl D. Balog C.I. Dijkman R. van der Schors R.C. van der Raaij-Helmer E.M. van der Plas M.J. Leurs R. Deelder A.M. Smit M.J. Tensen C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13402-13411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and that CXCL9 and CXCL10 can be truncated at the carboxyl terminus by MMP-8 and MMP-9 (28Van den Steen P.E. Husson S.J. Proost P. Van Damme J. Opdenakker G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), however, no functional changes were found for any of these cleavages. Like many chemokines, CXCL11 is cleaved at the amino terminus after proline 2 by dipeptidylpeptidase IV (46Ludwig A. Schiemann F. Mentlein R. Lindner B. Brandt E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 72: 183-191PubMed Google Scholar, 47Proost P. Schutyser E. Menten P. Struyf S. Wuyts A. Opdenakker G. Detheux M. Parmentier M. Durinx C. Lambeir A.M. Neyts J. Liekens S.

Schutyser E. Put W. Parmentier M. Struyf S. Van Damme J. Blood. 2007; 110: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), resulting in loss of agonism, but the propensity of MMPs in processing this chemokine are unknown. Here, we have biochemically screened all CXCR3 ligands for MMP processing by evaluating CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 as leukocytic-MMP substrates and report that CXCL11 is processed by several MMPs resulting in altered receptor binding and glycosaminoglycan affinity. In particular, CXCL11 is first converted to a CXCR3 antagonist by NH2-terminal processing at positions 4 to 5, but this is lost upon COOH-terminal truncation revealing an unexpected site for receptor binding. Further, proteolytic loss of a COOH-terminal glycosaminoglycan-binding site is a new mechanism that might result in dispersal of chemotactic gradients in vivo and so contribute to regulation of Th1 cell recruitment and cell accumulation. Chemokine Cleavage Assays—All chemokines and analogues of MMP-cleaved chemokines were synthesized using t-Boc (tertiary butyloxycarbonyl) solid phase chemistry as described previously (48Clark-Lewis I. Vo L. Owen P. Anderson J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 287: 233-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recombinant human MMP-1, -2, -8, -9, -12, and soluble MMP-14 (lacking the transmembrane domain) were expressed and purified using standard techniques (49Butler G.S. Tam E.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol.

Enzyme activity was followed by the quenched fluorescence synthetic peptide cleavage assay with Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 (51Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Chemokine cleavage assays were performed in 50 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, with initial screening at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:10 (w/w) for 16 h at 37 °C, then assessed at lower enzyme concentrations to establish kinetic parameters, biological efficacy, and relevance. Unlike the other MMPs assayed, MMP-12 showed significant loss of activity through autodegradation in 16-h incubations, therefore kinetic analysis was performed after 2 h. Inhibition experiments were done in the presence of 10 μm EDTA, 10 μm Batimastat, or 10-fold molar excess MMP-8 hemopexin C domain. Assay results were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry on a Voyager-DE STR (Applied Biosystems) in sinapinic acid matrix and confirmed by 15% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE. Hemopexin C Domain Expression and Binding—MMP-8 linker with hemopexin C domain and an NH2-terminal His tag were cloned into the pGYMX vector and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 gold cells. Cell lysates were solubilized and protein purified by Ni2+-chelate chromatography followed by Superdex™ 75 gel filtration chromatography (GE Healthcare) yielding a pure 26-kDa product. This was confirmed to be MMP-8 linker and hemopexin C domain by Western blotting with antibody against the MMP-8 C domain (Chemicon). Chemokines were immobilized in 96-well plates (Falcon) at 500 ng/well in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 20 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) overnight at 4 °C. Wells were blocked for 1 h with PBS containing 2.5% bovine serum albumin. Binding of recombinant NH2-terminal His-tagged MMP-8 hemopexin C domain to immobilized chemokines was performed for 1 h in PBS at room temperature and was assessed by direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with alkaline phosphatase detection (Sigma). Washes were with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. Transfected and Isolated Cells—Human CXCR3-transfected B300-19 cells (52Loetscher M. Gerber B. Loetscher P. Jones S.A. Piali L. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by B. Moser (Bern, Switzerland) and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1.0 mg/ml G418. Human T cells were isolated from healthy volunteers as approved by the University of British Columbia Clinical Ethics Review Board. Peripheral blood was drawn into EDTA-treated vaccutainers and layered on Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences), as per the manufacturer's protocol. Monocytes were removed by adhesion to flask surfaces following 3 h incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Isolated lymphocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were activated by the addition of 5 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin-P (Sigma) for 3 days followed by 6 to 12 days in the presence of 100 units/ml interleukin-2 (Peprotech). Media was changed every 3 days. Expression of CXCR3 was confirmed by flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter EPICS XL-MCL) using mouse anti-hCXCR3 (R&D Systems, clone 49801). Calcium Mobilization—CXCR3-transfected B300-19 cells were resuspended at 1 × 107 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum and incubated with 2 μm Fluo-4-acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed to remove unincorporated agent and resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution (without calcium or magnesium, Sigma), 20 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm probenecid (Sigma). 3.5 × 105 cells were plated per well in 96-well clear bottom fluorescent plates (Nunc) and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min without braking. Cells were allowed to equilibrate at 37 °C for 15 min prior to addition of ligand. Calcium concentration was monitored by excitation of 485 nm and emission of 520 nm with a Molecular Devices Flex-station II as described previously (53Fricker S.P. Anastassov V. Cox J. Darkes M.C. Grujic O. Idzan S.R. Labrecque J. Lau G. Mosi R.M. Nelson K.L. Qin L. Santucci Z. Wong R.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 588-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Calibration was performed by addition of 5 μm ionomycin (Sigma) followed by 1 mm MnCl2 (Fisher Biotech) to determine Fmax and Fmin, respectively. Absolute Ca2+ concentrations were calculated as Kd × [(F - Fmin)/(Fmax - F)] (54Takahashi A. Camacho P. Lechleiter J.D. Herman B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1089-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), where the Kd of Fluo-4 was 345 nm, as reported by Molecular Probes. Antagonist experiments were performed by preincubating cells in the presence of CXCL11-(5–73) or CXCL11-(5–58), synthetic analogues of MMP-processed CXCL11 at positions 4–5 (CXCL11-(5–73)) and 58–59 (CXCL11-(5–58)), for 120 s prior to the addition of 3 nm full-length CXCL11, designated CXCL11-(1–73). CXCR3 Internalization—Internalization of CXCR3 on CXCR3-transfected B300-19 cells was measured following incubation of 5 × 105 cells with 10 and 100 nm full-length or truncated CXCL11 for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with 2 μg/ml mouse anti-CXCR3 (R&D Systems, Clone 49801) in PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Cells were washed three times, then incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with 1:200 diluted sheep anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) followed by 3 final washes and resuspension in 0.5 ml of PBS. Staining was analyzed by flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter EPICS XL-MCL) and internalization was calculated from the mean fluorescence intensity values relative to untreated cells. Chemotaxis—Chemotactic migration of CXCR3 transfectants and activated T lymphocytes was performed in a 48-well Boyden chamber across a 5-μm pore size polycarbonate membrane (Neuroprobe). Cells and chemokine were diluted in RPMI containing 20 mm HEPES and 1% bovine serum albumin. To the upper chamber, 2.5 × 105 cells were added. The chamber was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, then the upper chamber was aspirated and washed twice with distilled water. Inhibition experiments were performed as above except the lower chamber contained 10 nm CXCL11-(1–73) in combination with up to 10 μm of the truncated CXCL11 forms. Following incubation, the contents of the lower chamber were transferred to a MaxiSorp 96-well plate (Nunc) and frozen at -80 °C for at least 2 h. Cell content was determined by CyQUANT analysis, a fluorescent nucleic acid-based cellular quantitation assay, by comparison with a standard curve, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Probes). Chemotactic index was calculated as a ratio of cells migrating in response to chemokine compared with buffer control. Circular Dichroism—CD spectroscopy measurements were made in the far-ultraviolet range from 190 to 260 nm using a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter. Full-length and truncated CXCL11 forms, and full-length CXCL8 as a control, were resuspended at 10 μm in nanopure water and measured in a quartz cuvette of 0.1-cm path length at 25 °C. Data are reported as the average of 4 scans with a 1-nm bandwidth. When possible, secondary structure composition was predicted with the SOMCD algorithm (55Unneberg P. Merelo J.J. Chacon P. Moran F. Proteins. 2001; 42: 460-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycan Binding—CXCL11 binding to fluorescein-heparin (Molecular Probes) was determined using fluorescence polarization analysis on the Polarstar Optima 96-well fluorimeter (BMG) essentially as described previously for other binding proteins (56Kakehi K. Oda Y. Kinoshita M. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 297: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Incubations contained 0.1 μm heparin-fluorescein isothiocyanate and chemokines at concentrations of 0 to 2 μm, performed in 100 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 37 °C. To further assess the effect of MMP truncations of CXCL11 on heparin binding, 0.5 ml of 4 μm chemokine in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, was loaded onto 1-ml Hitrap™ heparin-Sepharose and cation exchange Sepharose columns (GE Healthcare) as described previously (57Lau E.K. Paavola C.D. Johnson Z. Gaudry J.P. Geretti E. Borlat F. Kungl A.J. Proudfoot A.E. Handel T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22294-22305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Bound CXCL11 and synthetic analogues of MMP-cleaved CXCL11 were eluted using a linear gradient of 0 to 1.5 m NaCl over 30 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and monitored by in-line absorbance at 215 nm on an AKTA Purifier (Amersham Biosciences). The effect of soluble glycosaminoglycans on CXCL11 cleavage by MMP-8 was assessed in 16-h reactions at 37 °C containing a chemokine to GAG ratio of 1:5 (w/w) and an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:10 (w/w). Heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate A, B, and C were obtained from Seikagaku. Hyaluronan was “Healon” from GE Healthcare.

RIG-I and MDA5 are cytoplasmic DEX(D/H) helicase proteins that can induce signaling in response to RNA ligands, including those from viral infections. LGP2, a homolog of RIG-I and MDA5 without the caspase recruitment domain required for signaling, plays an important role in modulating signaling by MDA5 and RIG-I, presumably through heterocomplex formation and/or by serving as a sink for RNAs. Here we demonstrate that LGP2 can be coexpressed with RIG-I to inhibit activation of the NF-κB reporter expression and that LGP2 protein produced in insect cells can bind both single- and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), with higher affinity and cooperativity for dsRNA. Electron microscopy and image reconstruction were used to determine the shape of the LGP2 monomer in the absence of dsRNA and of the dimer complexed to a 27-bp dsRNA. LGP2 has striking structural similarity to the helicase domain of the superfamily 2 DNA helicase, Hef. RNA recognition receptors are important for detection of and response to viral infections.

During RNA virus infection, double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA) 3The abbreviations used are: dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; ssRNA, single-stranded RNA; CARD, caspase recruitment domain; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; RD, regulatory domain; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; nt, nucleotide. generated during RNA replication are potent molecular patterns recognized by innate receptors (1Meylan E.

De novo-initiated but uncapped single-stranded RNAs (ssRNA) can also signal viral infections (4Nallagatla S.R. Hwang J. Toroney R. Zheng X. Cameron C.E. Bevilacqua P.C.

Several innate immunity receptors can recognize RNA ligands (6Eisenacher K. Steinberg C. Reindl W. Krug A. Immunobiology. 2008; 212: 701-714Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Within membranes, TLRs (Toll-like Receptors) 3, 7, and 8 can respond to single- and double-stranded RNAs (7Underhill D.M. Curr. Opin.

Within the cytoplasm, members of the superfamily 2 class of DEX(D/H) helicases and ATPases can sense RNAs to initiate antiviral responses. These include the RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I) and MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5) (8Gaspari A.A. J. Am. Acad.

Ligand binding can induce RIG-I and MDA5 to release the caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) within these proteins (12Lee M.S. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cells. 2007; 23: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar), leading to binding of the mitochondrial adaptor IPS-1 (interferon-β promoter stimulator-1, also known as MAVS, VISA, and Cardif) that coordinates the activities of kinases to activate transcription factors required for cytokine and chemokine production (17Lee M.S. Min Y.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 447-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 18Johnson C.L. Gale M. Trends Immunol. 2006; 27: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). LGP2 (laboratory of genetics and physiology 2), originally identified as a highly expressed gene in mammary tumors, is another cytoplasmic DEX(D/H)-box helicase that can recognize RNA (19Saito T. Hirai R. Loo Y.M. Owen D. Johnson C.L. Sinha S.C. Akira S. Fujita T. Gale M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Unlike RIG-I and MDA5, LGP2 lacks the CARDs (20Rothenfusser S. Goutagny N. DiPerna G. Gong M. Monks B.G. Schoenemeyer A. Yamamoto M. Akira S. Fitzgerald K.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5260-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed to antagonize RIG-I- and MDA5-mediated signaling by forming heterodimeric complexes with these proteins (19Saito T. Hirai R. Loo Y.M. Owen D. Johnson C.L. Sinha S.C. Akira S. Fujita T. Gale M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 21Vilasco M. Larrea E. Vitour D. Dabo S. Breiman A. Regnault B. Riezu J.I.

Science's STKE. 2007; 2007: pe20Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In Sendai virus-infected cells, LGP2 can coprecipitate with RIG-I in an interaction that requires the RIG-I CARD, suggesting a repression of signaling (19Saito T. Hirai R. Loo Y.M. Owen D. Johnson C.L. Sinha S.C. Akira S. Fujita T. Gale M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). In addition, LGP2 can interact with IPS-1 to block binding by IKKι that would otherwise activate IRF-3, a key transcription factor in interferon production (10Komuro A. Horvath C.M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 12332-12342Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 21Vilasco M. Larrea E. Vitour D. Dabo S. Breiman A. Regnault B. Riezu J.I. Eid P. Prieto J. Meurs E.F. Hepatology. 2006; 44: 1635-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Despite evidence that LGP2 may act as a negative regulator of innate signaling (20Rothenfusser S. Goutagny N. DiPerna G. Gong M. Monks B.G. Schoenemeyer A. Yamamoto M. Akira S. Fitzgerald K.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5260-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), its activity may be more complex because Lgp2-/- mice exhibit both a defect in IFN production in response to encephalomyocarditis virus infection and resistance to lethal doses of vesicular stomatitis virus (23Venkataraman T. Valdes M. Elsby R. Kakuta S. Caceres G. Saijo S. Iwakura Y. Barber G.N. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 6444-6455Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The main goal of this study is to understand how LGP2 can respond to ligands. We characterized the structure and RNA binding by the recombinant LGP2 expressed in insect cells; imaged monomers, dimers, and oligomers of LGP2 using electron microscopy; and reconstructed three-dimensional images without presumed symmetry. The resulting model of the LGP2 monomer has obvious similarity to the crystal structure of the Hef helicase domain (24Nishino T. Komori K. Tsuchiya D. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 2005; 13: 143-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The remaining electron density can accommodate the recently reported structure of the RIG-I regulatory domain (15Cui S. Eisenacher K. Kirchhofer A. Brzozka K. Lammens A. Lammens K. Fujita T.

Cell-based Reporter Assays—HEK 293T cells were harvested from an actively growing culture and plated in CoStar white 96-well plates at 4.5 × 104 cells/well. Cells at ∼80% confluency were used for transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) mixed with plasmids pNiFty-Luc (30 ng, Invivogen) and phRL-TK (5 ng, Promega), which code for the firefly luciferase reporter under a promoter that contains NF-κB elements and the Renilla luciferase driven by the herpesvirus thymidine kinase promoter, respectively. Where appropriate, plasmids encoding Rig-I (pUNO-hRIG-I; Invivogen) and/or Lgp2 (pUNO-hLGP2; Invivogen) were added to the transfection mixture. Transfected cells were incubated for 24 h to allow expression from the plasmids. Ligand to induce RIG-I was transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine. The ligand shRNA was synthesized by in vitro transcription using a T7 RNA polymerase kit (Ambion, Inc.) and purified from a denaturing polyacrylamide gel as described by Kao et al. (25Kao C.C. Yang X. Kline A. Wang Q.M. Barket D. Heinz B.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11121-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). After another 12-h incubation, the cells were harvested using the Dual-Glo Luciferase assay system (Promega). Luminescence was quantified using a FLUOstar OPTIMA Plate Reader (BMG LABTECH, Inc). All assays were performed with six independent replicates per experiment, and each result reported was consistent in at least two sets of assays. LGP2 Expression and Purification—Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda 9) cells were cultured in HyQ® SFX-Insect™ medium (Hyclone) and grown at 27 °C in flasks. Full-length Lgp2 was cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pBAC-1 (Novagen, Inc.), and its sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. The expression constructs were cotransfected with linearized baculovirus DNA (BD Biosciences) into Sf9 cells, and the resultant recombinant virus was amplified and used for protein expression. At 72 h after infection with baculovirus encoding Lgp2, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 680 × g and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 30,600 × g for 15 min. HIS-Select (Sigma) nickel affinity resin was added to the clarified supernatant to bind the recombinant protein. The resin was washed four times with Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 10 mm imidazole. Bound protein was eluted with Buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole. Purified LGP2 was concentrated and further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (HiLoad 16/60, GE Healthcare) eluted with Buffer A. Gel filtration chromatography used to study RNA binding used a Superdex 200 column (10/300 GL) calibrated with protein standards (Bio-Rad). Gel-based RNA Protein-binding Assays—RNA RS46, which forms an intramolecular hairpin with a stem of 21 bp, was used for gel-based assays. RS46 was made by in vitro transcription using a T7 RNA polymerase kit (Ambion) and purified as a single band from a denaturing gel. The RNA was treated with alkaline phosphatase and radiolabeled with [32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Prior to use, RS46 was heated to 90 °C followed by slow cooling to room temperature to induce hairpin formation. The 27-nt single-stranded RNA (css27) was made by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase in the AmpliScribe kit (Ambion). The RNA was then purified from free NTPs, aborted oligonucleotides, and the digested DNA template by purification with a P-6 gel filtration column. An aliquot of the RNA was treated with alkaline phosphatase to remove the 5′-terminal phosphates and then adjusted to the same concentration as the untreated RNA. UV-induced cross-linking reactions were performed with 1 μg of purified proteins and 40 fm RNA in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm NaCl (pH 8.1) by irradiation with UV light at 1200 mJ for 2 min. The cross-linking reactions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the bands were visualized using a PhosphorImager. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays used labeled RNA (50 pm) incubated with a 125 nm final concentration of the desired protein in a 20-μl reaction containing 20 mm sodium glutamate, pH 8.2, 4 mm MgCl2, 12.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. After an incubation at 25 °C for 30 min, a 4-μl termination mix (containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 30% glycerol) was added. The samples were electrophoresed on a native 10% polyacrylamide gel at 400 V for 1 h, after which the gel was wrapped in plastic and autoradiographed. Fluorescence Anisotropy Assay—Cy3-labeled RNA probes for the binding assays were synthesized, purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, and quantified by the manufacturer (IDT Technologies). The probes were diluted to 200 nm in Buffer A. For the formation of dsRNA, the probes were heated at a 1:1 molar ratio with the complementary RNA in an 80 °C water bath, after which the bath was allowed to cool to room temperature. Fluorescence measurements were made at room temperature with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences luminescence spectrometer LS55 using cuvettes with an optical path length of 0.4 cm. Measurements were taken with an integration time of 1 s and a slit width of 5 nm. The excitation and emission wavelengths used were 490 and 520 nm, respectively. Anisotropy values were recorded 20 s after each protein addition to allow the sample to reach equilibrium. The total volume of protein added was <5% of the final volume. Represented anisotropy values are the average of 10 measurements. Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear least square fitting using KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The Hill equation, ΔA = BmaxXn/(Xn + K nd) was used to determine the dissociation constant (Kd). In this equation, ΔA is the anisotropy change caused by the ligand binding, Bmax is the maximum anisotropy change, X is the total concentration of the input protein, and the exponential term n is the Hill coefficient. Electron Microscopy—LGP2 (∼0.6 ng/μl in Buffer A) was negatively stained on a freshly glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grid with a 1% (w/v) aqueous solution of uranyl acetate. The grid was viewed in a JEOL 1200 EX TEM at a calibrated magnification of ×56,200 and an operating voltage of 100 kV. The micrographs were digitized using an Epson Projection 3200 scanner at 1200 dpi corresponding to 4.1 Å/pixel at the specimen level. Three-dimensional reconstructions were calculated using the EMAN (version 1.8) software package (26Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar) in procedures similar to those described by Sun et al. (27Sun J. DuFort C. Daniel M.C. Murali A. Chen C. Gopinath K. Stein B. De M. Rotello V.M. Holzenburg A. Kao C.C. Dragnea B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1354-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). More than 3,000 single particles of the LGP2 were selected using the boxer routine, filtered to remove high frequency noise, centered, and aligned. The particles were then used to generate class averages without imposed symmetry using EMAN′s “refine2d” routine. An initial three-dimensional model was calculated from a set of selected noise-free class averages. The reconstructions were iteratively refined until the structure was stable as judged by Fourier shell correlation. A molecular mass of 80 kDa was used for the surface-rendering threshold of the three-dimensional structure. Three-dimensional reconstructions were visualized using the Chimera software package (28Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (29000) Google Scholar). To visualize oligomeric LGP2 complexed to dsRNA, it was mixed with a 4-fold molar excess with 40-bp poly(I-C) in Buffer A and incubated on ice for 10 min prior to fixing the sample on an electron microscopy grid and staining with uranyl acetate as described above. The sample was viewed in a JEOL 1200 EX electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV and at a calibrated magnification of ×38,900. The micrographs were digitized at 1200 dpi, corresponding to 5.5 Å/pixel at the specimen level. LGP2 Can Modulate RIG-I Activation of Gene Expression— To assess the biological activity of LGP2, we transiently transfected HEK 293T cells with plasmids expressing an innate immunity receptor along with two reporter constructs: a firefly luciferase reporter construct driven by a promoter containing the NF-κB binding element and a Renilla luciferase driven by the thymidine kinase promoter. The Renilla luciferase serves as a transfection control and a control for the general health of the cells (29Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Miller W. Sun J. Xiong J. Santos J. Yarbrough I. Lamb R.J. Mills J. Duffy K.E. Hoose S. Cunningham M. Holzenburg A. Mbow M.L. Sarisky R.T. Kao C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17696-17705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Results from the firefly luciferase were divided by the Renilla luciferase to generate the term Ratio-FF/R. In some of the samples, the Ratio-FF/R could be from ligand-induced versus uninduced cells. In each sample, at least three independent wells of cells were tested with each condition, and each set of results was repeated in at least two experiments and found to be consistent. The plasmid expressing LGP2 was unable to activate the NF-κB promoter in the presence of several ligands, including ssRNA, hairpin RNA, or double-stranded RNA such as poly(I-C) (data not shown). However, the plasmid expressing RIG-I could activate the promoter by 8 of 14-fold when the cells were induced by transfecting poly(I-C) or a 60-nt hairpin RNA named shRNA10 (Fig. 1B and data not shown). No response was detected when shRNA10 or other ligands were added to the medium (data not shown), consistent with previous reports on the requirements of Rig-I induction (19Saito T. Hirai R. Loo Y.M. Owen D. Johnson C.L. Sinha S.C. Akira S. Fujita T. Gale M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The activation was also specific to Rig-I because wild-type TLR3 and Rig-I with a mutation in the ATP-binding motif (K270A) had much lower responses to shRNA10 (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis showed that K270A is expressed at a comparable level to wild-type RIG-I (data not shown). Because RIG-I was active for inducing reporter activity, we examined the effect of the presence of LGP2 on RIG-I activity. At a 1:1 ratio of the two plasmids, an ∼50% reduction in RIG-I activity was observed (Fig. 1C). At a ×5 or 10 molar ratio of the plasmid encoding Lgp2 to Rig-I, RIG-I-dependent reporter activities were reduced to background (Fig. 1D). In these experiments, the same amounts of DNA were transfected; any differences were adjusted by the addition of the empty vector. The identical concentration of pUNO-LGP2 did not induce the NF-κB reporter (Fig. 1C). These results are consistent with those of Saito et al. (19Saito T. Hirai R. Loo Y.M. Owen D. Johnson C.L. Sinha S.C. Akira S. Fujita T. Gale M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that LGP2 could inhibit RIG-I activation of the IFN-β promoter. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that Lgp2 cDNA used here is functional in cells and hence is appropriate for biochemical analysis. RNA Binding by Recombinant LGP2 Protein—Soluble LGP2 was produced using baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and purified to a single band when visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 2A). LGP2 was eluted at ∼80 kDa in a gel filtration column when compared with calibrants, in excellent agreement with the mass expected of an LGP2 monomer. Several RNA binding assays were used to characterize the biochemical activity of LGP2. First, a UV-induced cross-linking assay was performed with a radiolabeled RNA named RS46 that contains a 21-bp perfect duplex capped by a GNRA hairpin. A shifted band was detected in denaturing PAGE with the reaction containing LGP2, whereas an equal concentration of organophosphate hydrolase, which does not bind RNA, served as a negative control (Fig. 2B). A similar result was observed by a nondenaturing electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 2C). These results qualitatively demonstrate that LGP2 can bind RNA. RIG-I and the regulatory domain of the RIG-I protein were reported to preferentially bind RNAs with a 5′-triphosphate (15Cui S. Eisenacher K. Kirchhofer A. Brzozka K. Lammens A. Lammens K. Fujita T.

Narita R. Gale Jr., M. Inagaki F. Fujita T. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 428-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). To examine whether LGP2 has a similar activity, we prepared a 27-nt RNA named css27 by in vitro transcription in the presence of internal radiolabels. An aliquot of css27 was then treated with alkaline phosphatase to remove the 5′ phosphates. Phosphatase treatment of css27 reduced cross-linking to LGP2 by about 2-fold (Fig. 2D). Thus, LGP2 exhibits preference for a ligand containing a 5′-triphosphate, although it can recognize RNA lacking a 5′-triphosphate. Because LGP2 can bind to both ssRNA and dsRNA, we wanted to determine which form is preferred. To examine this and to determine whether RNA can induce LGP2 oligomerization, gel filtration chromatography was used. A chemically synthesized ss27 mixed with LGP2 resulted in a slight change in the LGP2 elution profile (Fig. 2E, left panel). However, dsRNA consisting of ss27 annealed to its complement css27 produced a larger shift in the LGP2 elution profile as well as a dramatic increase of a peak at ∼160 kDa that is indicative of an LGP2 dimer (Fig. 2E, right panel). These results using purified LGP2 are in agreement with observations that LGP2 present in a lysate can oligomerize in the presence of dsRNA (19Saito T. Hirai R. Loo Y.M. Owen D. Johnson C.L. Sinha S.C. Akira S. Fujita T. Gale M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Furthermore, LGP2 preferentially binds to dsRNA rather than to ssRNA. Quantitative Examination of RNA Binding by LGP2—A fluorescence anisotropy assay was used to determine the affinities of LGP2 binding to RNAs. A series of chemically synthesized RNAs of 10 or 27 nt with 5′-Cy3 fluorophores were used (Fig. 3A). A linear increase in the anisotropy of the single-stranded 10- and 27-nt RNAs was observed with increasing LGP2 concentrations (Fig. 3, A and B). However, the binding isotherms did not reach saturation with either ssRNAs, and the Kd values for either RNAs can only be estimated to be in excess of 1,000 nm, the highest concentration of LGP2 assayed (Fig. 3B). The 10- and 27-nt ssRNAs were also annealed to complementary oligonucleotides to form dsRNA. Upon LGP2 addition, anisotropy values changed dramatically and reached saturation. The binding isotherms fitted to the Hill equation revealed that the Kd values were 175 and 384 + 138 nm for the 10- and 27-bp RNAs, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). The value for the 27-bp RNA was derived from three independent experiments. We note that these binding assays were performed in a buffer that contained 150 mm monovalent salt to discourage nonspecific binding and could be better in a buffer with reduced salt. The Kd was 121 nm for LGP2 binding to a partial RNA duplex where the Cy3-labeled 10-nt RNA was annealed to C27 (generating a 10-bp duplex and a 17-nt overhang) (Fig. 3A). These results demonstrate that LGP2 clearly prefers binding to dsRNA over ssRNA and that RNAs that contain partially double-stranded regions are also recognized. Lastly, the Hill coefficients for LGP2 binding to dsRNAs and to the partial duplex were above 2.3, indicating positive cooperativity (Fig. 3A). Cooperative LGP2 binding to dsRNA may provide a basis for LGP2 oligomerization. A Low-resolution Structure for LGP2—Image reconstruction of single particles from electron micrographs can be used to obtain low-resolution structures of proteins and protein complexes (30Rixon F.J. Chiu W. Adv. Protein Chem. 2003; 64: 379-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 31Zhou Z.H. Chiu W. Adv. Protein Chem. 2003; 64: 93-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We performed this analysis without imposed symmetry for more than 3,000 individual particles of the monomeric LGP2 (Fig. 4, A and B). Refinement of the initial model for eight cycles resulted in a structure that converged to a resolution of ∼28 Å (Fig. 4C). As a check on the reconstruction, the particles used represented all of the expected views seen in the class averages (Fig. 4B). The overall shape of LGP2 resembles a partially opened clamp with a length of 89 Å (Fig. 4E). Notably, the lower portion of the clamp shown in Fig. 4E contains a groove (with a width of ∼21 Å) that may be involved in RNA binding. Given that LGP2 contains helicase-like motifs, we compared the electron density of LGP2 to the crystal structure of the Hhd (Hef helicase domain) (residues 1–494) of the Hef protein from the hyperthermophyllic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus, another member of the superfamily 2 helicase (24Nishino T. Komori K. Tsuchiya D. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 2005; 13: 143-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Hhd consists of three subdomains (24Nishino T. Komori K. Tsuchiya D. Ishino Y. Morikawa K.

Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Similar to other members of superfamily 2 helicase group, a parallel α-β domain contains the seven helicase motifs (24Nishino T. Komori K. Tsuchiya D. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 2005; 13: 143-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and corresponds to domains 1 and 3 (Fig. 5A). A comparison of the helicase motifs in the Hhd and LGP2 is shown in supplemental Fig. 1. Like LGP2, the crystal structure of Hhd resembles a partially opened clamp with a concave groove associated with its lower portion (Fig. 5A). In Hhd, this groove contains the various DEAD-box helicase motifs that are involved in ATP recognition and hydrolysis and also RNA binding (33Cordin O. Banroques J. Tanner N.K. Linder P. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 367: 17-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Notably, the center of the LGP2 clamp is broader than the comparable region in Hhd (Fig. 5B), likely because of additional domains that are present in LGP2. LGP2, RIG-I, and MDA5 all share a C-terminal regulatory domain (RD) (also known as a C-terminal domain (16Takahasi K. Yoneyama M. Nishihori T. Hirai R. Kumeta H. Narita R. Gale Jr., M. Inagaki F.

https://openalex.org/W1971209284,"Mice were subjected to different dietary manipulations to selectively alter expression of hepatic sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) or SREBP-2. mRNA levels for key target genes were measured and compared with the direct binding of SREBP-1 and -2 to the associated promoters using isoform specific antibodies in chromatin immunoprecipitation studies. A diet supplemented with Zetia (ezetimibe) and lovastatin increased and decreased nuclear SREBP-2 and SREBP-1, respectively, whereas a fasting/refeeding protocol dramatically altered SREBP-1 but had modest effects on SREBP-2 levels. Binding of both SREBP-1 and -2 increased on promoters for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, fatty-acid synthase, and squalene synthase in livers of Zetia/lovastatin-treated mice despite the decline in total SREBP-1 protein. In contrast, only SREBP-2 binding was increased for the low density lipoprotein receptor promoter. Decreased SREBP-1 binding during fasting and a dramatic increase upon refeeding indicates that the lipogenic ""overshoot"" for fatty-acid synthase gene expression known to occur during high carbohydrate refeeding can be attributed to a similar overshoot in SREBP-1 binding. SREBP co-regulatory protein recruitment was also increased/decreased in parallel with associated changes in SREBP binding, and there were clear distinctions for different promoters in response to the dietary manipulations. Taken together, these studies reveal that there are alternative molecular mechanisms for activating SREBP target genes in response to the different dietary challenges of Zetia/lovastatin versus fasting/refeeding. This underscores the mechanistic flexibility that has evolved at the individual gene/promoter level to maintain metabolic homeostasis in response to shifting nutritional states and environmental fluctuations."
https://openalex.org/W1967767742,"Prokaryotes of the genus Mycoplasma are the smallest cellular organisms that persist as obligate extracellular parasites. Although mycoplasma infection is known to be associated with chromosomal instability and can promote malignant transformation, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena remain unknown. Since persistence of many cellular parasites requires suppression of apoptosis in host cells, we tested the effect of mycoplasma infection on the activity of the p53 and nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathways, major mechanisms controlling programmed cell death. To monitor the activity of p53 and NF-κB in mycoplasma-infected cells, we used a panel of reporter cell lines expressing the bacterial β-galactosidase gene under the control of p53- or NF-κB-responsive promoters. Cells incubated with media conditioned with different species of mycoplasma showed constitutive activation of NF-κB and reduced activation of p53, common characteristics of the majority of human tumor cells, with M. arginini having the strongest effect among the species tested. Moreover, mycoplasma infection reduced the expression level and inducibility of an endogenous p53-responsive gene, p21waf1, and inhibited apoptosis induced by genotoxic stress. Infection with M. arginini made rat and mouse embryo fibroblasts susceptible to transformation with oncogenic H-Ras, whereas mycoplasma-free cells underwent irreversible p53-dependent growth arrest. Mycoplasma infection was as effective as shRNA-mediated knockdown of p53 expression in making rodent fibroblasts permissive to Ras-induced transformation. These observations indicate that mycoplasma infection plays the role of a p53-suppressing oncogene that cooperates with Ras in cell transformation and suggest that the carcinogenic and mutagenic effects of mycoplasma might be due to inhibition of p53 tumor suppressor function by this common human parasite."

The latter lipid is synthesized de novo in the cytosol and is also regenerated after its release from the C55-PP-linked glycans in the periplasm.

C55-P is utilized as a carrier lipid that allows the transport of the hydrophilic oligosaccharide precursors across the cytoplasmic membrane toward the periplasm where the elongation of the glycan chains takes place. Accordingly, the precursor is linked to the carrier lipid via a pyrophosphate linkage (C55-PP-substrate) through the action of a specific glycosyltransferase at the cytosolic side of the inner membrane; thereafter, the complex is translocated through the membrane by a yet unknown mechanism, and finally, the glycosyl moiety is transferred to the appropriate expanding polymer. De novo synthesis of C55-P implicates two enzymatic steps (11Touzé T. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Böck A. Curtiss III, R. Kaper J.B. Karp P.D. Neidhardt F.C. Nyström T. Slauch J.M. Squires C.L.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2733-2738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C55-PP must then be dephosphorylated to yield the active monophosphate form of the carrier lipid (11Touzé T. Mengin-Lecreulx D.

C55-PP is not solely generated by de novo synthesis, but it is also released and recycled after the transfer of the oligosaccharide unit to the growing polymer in the periplasm. It is yet unclear on which side of the membrane C55-PP dephosphorylation occurs and how the carrier lipid is translocated across the membrane before being reused.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in this study Restriction sites introduced in oligonucleotides are underlined.NameSequencepgpBNcoI5′-GCGCCCATGGCCATGCGTTCGATTGCCAGACGTACC-3′pgpBHindIII5′-GCGCAAGCTTGGGCTAAATTCGGAAAATCAACCAGC-3′pgpBBglII5′-GCGCAGATCTACTTTCTTGTTCTCGTTGCGCTAT-3′pgpB5′5′-GCGCGGATCCATAGACTAGCGCGACATGATCGTG-3′pgpBG115′-GCGCGGTACCGCTCCCACTGCGGTACGTCTGGCAATCG-3′pgpBK395′-GCGCGGTACCGCTTTTAGTAGCCAACTTTGTTC-3′pgpBK735′-GCGCGGTACCGCCTTAATGCGAAAACGCAGACACC-3′pgpBK975′-GCGCGGTACCGCTTTGATCCAGGATTTAACGCCTTG-3′pgpBE1205′-GCGCGGTACCGCCTCATCAACCGGAATATGATGTGTTTTTTC-3′pgpBE1405′-GCGCGGTACCGCCTCTTCAGCCAACTGTTCTTTCACTAG-3′pgpBP1605′-GCGCGGTACCGCAGGAAAGGCAAACCCCGTCTCTTTC-3′pgpBT1845′-GCGCGGTACCGCCGTTCGCCGACGCGGCCACAGCAAAC-3′pgpBR2105′-GCGCGGTACCGCGCGTGGCCAATGCATCCCGAGCAG-3′pgpBP2365′-GCGCGGTACCGCTGGCCCACAAATTCGTTGCGCAAGC-3′pgpBS2545′-GCGCGGTACCGCACTTTCTTGTTCTCGTTGCGCTATTTC-3′ Open table in a new tab The enzymatic dephosphorylation of C55-PP is the target of bacitracin, a cyclic polypeptide antibiotic that interacts tightly with C55-PP, thereby inhibiting the formation of C55-P through the sequestration of its precursor (15Siewert G.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3784-3789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) earlier identified the Escherichia coli bacA gene whose overexpression conferred increased resistance to bacitracin. More recently, the BacA protein was demonstrated to catalyze C55-PP dephosphorylation in vitro (18El Ghachi M. Bouhss A. Blanot D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30106-30113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The resistance to bacitracin conferred by the overexpression of bacA was then explained by the fact that overproducing the C55-PP phosphatase activity should dramatically deplete the cellular pool of C55-PP, the target of the antibiotic. The deletion of bacA was not lethal, which was consistent with the fact that the essential C55-PP phosphatase cellular activity present in ΔbacA cells was not totally abolished but was reduced by 75% compared with wild-type cells (18El Ghachi M. Bouhss A. Blanot D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30106-30113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). El Ghachi et al. (19El Ghachi M. Derbise A. Bouhss A.

The three genes could be independently disrupted without effect on growth in laboratory conditions. However, the simultaneous inactivation of ybjG and pgpB together with bacA could never be obtained, suggestive of a lethal effect. The lethality of the triple mutation was further demonstrated by the construction of a conditional thermosensitive mutant BWTsbacA (ΔbacA, ΔybjG, ΔpgpB) carrying the pMAKbacA plasmid with a thermosensitive replicon (19El Ghachi M. Derbise A. Bouhss A. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18689-18695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that PgpB, YbjG, and BacA contributed to the total C55-PP phosphatase activity in E. coli. Interestingly, the presence of only one of these chromosomal genes was sufficient to sustain normal cell growth, raising the question of the relevance of multiple C55-PP phosphatases in E. coli. Surprisingly, the overexpression of yeiU that also led to a significant rise of C55-PP phosphatase activity was not able to rescue cell viability of the triple mutant, suggesting that YeiU has another function besides the dephosphorylation of C55-PP. We recently demonstrated that YeiU, renamed LpxT, not only dephosphorylated the carrier lipid C55-PP but could also transfer the released phosphate group to lipid A (phosphotransferase activity) (20Touzé T. Tran A.X. Hankins J.V. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Trent M.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 67: 264-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). PgpB together with LpxT and YbjG belongs to the type 2 phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP2) family previously identified by Stukey and Carman (21Stukey J. Carman G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar); they all possess a characteristic phosphatase signature in which three distinct conserved motifs are visible, designated C1, C2, and C3 (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Amino acid sequence alignment of PAP2 enzymes.

Raetz C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 722-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further analyses suggested that the pgpB product had a broad substrate spectrum, as in vitro-measured phosphatase activities toward PGP, phosphatidic acid (PA), but also, lysoPA and diacylglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP) were significantly increased in pgpB-overexpressing cells (23Funk C.R.

In the present study the E. coli PgpB membrane protein was purified to homogeneity, and a biochemical characterization of the enzyme was performed to elucidate its specificity. We show here that PgpB efficiently dephosphorylates various lipid pyrophosphate molecules, thereby confirming its broad substrate spectrum. In particular, PgpB dephosphorylates C55-PP, and this reaction is dependent upon the addition of phospholipids. Several lines of evidence suggest that the phospholipids do not regulate PgpB activity per se but proceed through their interaction with the long chain C55-PP lipid. A topological map of PgpB was also established by using the β-lactamase fusion procedure; it shows that PgpB is constituted of six transmembrane segments, with its N- and C-terminal ends localized in the cytoplasm and the active site located on the outer side of the cytoplasmic membrane.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—The E. coli strains DH5α (Invitrogen) and C43(DE3) (Avidis) were used as hosts for plasmids and PgpB overproduction, respectively.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431-435Google Scholar), and growth was monitored at 600 nm with a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer. When appropriate, cultures were supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml).Chemicals—DNA restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, the Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase was from Stratagene, and oligonucleotides were from MWG-Biotech.

Antibiotics and reagents were from Sigma. Silica gel 60 thin layer plates were purchased from Merck.Construction of Plasmids—For the construction of plasmid pPgpB, which allows the expression of a wild-type form of the protein, the pgpB gene was PCR-amplified from E. coli K-12 chromosome using oligonucleotides pgpBNcoI and pgpBHindIII (see Table 1), introducing an NcoI and a HindIII restriction site at the 5′ and 3′ end of pgpB gene, respectively. After cleavage by the appropriate endonucleases, the PCR product was inserted into the corresponding sites of the expression vector pTrc99A. Similarly, for the expression of the C-terminal His6-tagged form of PgpB, the plasmid pPgpBHis was created. In that case, the pgpB gene was amplified using oligonucleotides pgpBNcoI and pgpBBglII, and after restriction of the PCR product by NcoI and BglII, the fragment was inserted between the corresponding sites of the plasmid vector pTrcHis60. In both recombinant plasmids, pgpB expression was under the control of the IPTG-inducible trc promoter.For topology analysis, various truncated forms at the 3′ end of the pgpB gene were PCR-amplified from the E. coli chromosome using oligonucleotides listed in Table 1 and cloned into pNF150, a plasmid vector carrying the lac promoter, a fragment of the β-galactosidase gene, and the mature form of the β-lactamase gene (26Debarbieux L. Bohin A. Bohin J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6692-6698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For all constructs, the oligonucleotide pgpB5′ was used as the primer for the 5′ end of the gene, introducing a BamHI site 252 bp upstream from the initiation codon of pgpB. Different oligonucleotides were then used as 3′ end primers introducing a KpnI site (Tables 1 and 2). The generated PCR products were cleaved by BamHI and KpnI enzymes and inserted into the corresponding sites of the pNF150 vector, creating in-frame fusions of the truncated forms of the pgpB gene product to the mature form of β-lactamase via a short peptide linker, AVPHAISSSPLR, originating from the sequence of the pNF150 plasmid vector. The nucleotide sequence of all constructs was verified by automated sequencing (MWG-Biotech).TABLE 2Characterization of PgpB-BlaM hybrids For all pgpB-blaM constructs, the amplification of truncated forms of pgpB was performed using the pgpB5′ oligonucleotide (5′ end of the gene) and various others (3′ end) listed in this table.

When the optical density (A600) of the culture reached 0.8, IPTG was added at the final concentration of 1 mm, and growth was continued for 3.5 h. Cells were then harvested (4000 × g, 10 min) and resuspended in 40 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol (buffer A). They were disrupted by 3 successive passages through a French press, and the membrane and soluble proteins were separated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellet was washed 3 times in 20 ml of buffer A, and membranes were then solubilized by incubation in 20 ml of buffer A supplemented with 2% (w/v) DDM detergent for 2 h at 4 °C. The latter solution was centrifuged (100,000 × g, 1 h), and the supernatant was incubated with 2 ml Ni2+-NTA and 10 mm imidazole at 4 °C overnight. The resin was washed successively with 20 volumes of 10 and 30 mm imidazole solutions prepared in buffer A supplemented with 0.2% DDM. Final elution was performed with buffer A supplemented with 400 mm imidazole and 0.2% DDM, yielding a pure fraction of PgpB protein. This fraction was concentrated up to 1.5 mg/ml by ultrafiltration on Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devices (Millipore) and thoroughly dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.02% DDM before being stored at -20 °C. Typically, up to 2.5 mg of pure PgpB protein were obtained from 1 liter of bacterial cell culture. Protein concentration was determined using the Sigma bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay system (28Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18445) Google Scholar).Mass Spectrometry—Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analysis of PgpB samples was performed on a PerSeptive Voyager-DE STR instrument (Applied Biosystems). 0.5 μl of the PgpB solution was deposited on the plate and allowed to dry. Subsequently, 0.5 μl of matrix solution (10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) was applied to the dried sample and again allowed to dry. Spectra were recorded in a positive ion mode at an acceleration voltage of +25 kV and an extraction delay time of 300 ns. Enolase was used as an external calibrant.Gel Filtration—Gel filtration chromatography was performed using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with two column volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% DDM, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Elution of proteins was followed at 280 nm. Protein standards, whose elution profiles were known to be unchanged in the presence of DDM (29Le Maire M. Aggerbeck L.P. Monteilhet C. Andersen J.P.

The void volume was determined using dextran blue. A 100-μl aliquot of the protein sample was loaded onto the column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The PgpB·DDM complex was eluted as a single peak at an elution volume of 12.6 ml corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa.Phosphatase Assays—Standard C55-PP phosphatase assays were performed in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.6% DDM, and [14C]C55-PP (2305 Bq, varying concentrations). Pure PgpB protein was added to initiate the reaction, and after 30 min of incubation at 37 °C the reaction was stopped by heat denaturation of the enzyme. Appropriate dilution of the enzyme was used so that the amount of hydrolyzed substrate did not exceed 30% at the end of the reaction. The samples were analyzed by TLC as already described (18El Ghachi M. Bouhss A. Blanot D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30106-30113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). When the phosphatase activity was investigated at various pH values, buffering was achieved in sodium acetate (pH 5–5.5), Bis-Tris (pH 6–6.5), or Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7–9). To test the phosphatase activity of PgpB toward various mono- and pyrophosphate molecules, the release of inorganic phosphate was measured during catalysis. Phosphatase reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.6% DDM, the appropriate substrate, and PgpB were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 0.9 ml of Malachite green (Biomol Green), and the released phosphate was measured at 620 nm and quantified relative to a phosphate standard curve. With this approach, we could not distinguish between the removal of the β-phosphate from that of the α-phosphate when pyrophosphate molecules were used. Therefore, when measuring the initial rate of dephosphorylation of pyrophosphates, we ensured that no more than 10% of the phosphate was removed, thereby limiting the amount of the released α-phosphate taking into account that PgpB has higher activity toward pyro- than monophosphates (see below). All enzyme assays were performed at least in triplicate. For the determination of kinetic constants, initial velocity data were fitted to the equation v = VS/(Km + S) by the Levenberg-Marquardt method (32Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1986: 521-528Google Scholar), and values ± S.D. at 95% of confidence were calculated; the MDFitt software developed by M. Desmadril (UMR 8619 CNRS, Orsay, France) was used for this purpose.RESULTSExpression and Purification of PgpB—The pgpB gene was cloned under the control of the IPTG-inducible trc promoter in the expression vectors pTrc99A and pTrcHis60, yielding plasmids pPgpB and pPgpBHis, which allow the expression of wild-type and C-terminal His6-tagged proteins, respectively. The plasmids were transformed into the E. coli BWTsbacA thermosensitive strain, which carries deletions of the three pgpB, ybjG, and bacA chromosomal genes and bears an intact copy of bacA on a plasmid (pMAKbacA) whose replication is impaired at 42 °C (19El Ghachi M. Derbise A. Bouhss A. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18689-18695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The two constructed PgpB-expressing plasmids allowed growth of this mutant strain at the restrictive temperature with and without addition of IPTG in the culture medium, showing that they both expressed an active form of PgpB. Interestingly, the fact that the inducer IPTG was not required to allow complementation indicated that a basal expression level of PgpB was sufficient to ensure the supply of C55-P in vivo. Overproduction of the His6-tagged form of PgpB was then performed in the C43(DE3) strain in the conditions detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Accumulation in the membrane fraction of a protein of about 30 kDa was observed by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3A), a finding in agreement with the calculated molecular mass of the recombinant PgpB protein, 30,290 Da, taking into account the Arg-Ser-His6 extension. This protein was successfully solubilized with the DDM detergent and purified as detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” yielding an apparently pure PgpB sample, as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Purification of the PgpB protein.A, the C-terminal His6-tagged PgpB protein was purified on Ni2+-NTA as detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” and aliquots of the different fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

https://openalex.org/W2062779167,"Several methods allow reprogramming of differentiated somatic cells to embryonic stem cell-like cells. However, the process of reprogramming remains inefficient and the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we report the optimization of somatic cell fusion with embryonic stem cells in order to provide an efficient, quantitative assay to screen for factors that facilitate reprogramming. Following optimization, we achieved a reprogramming efficiency 15–590 fold higher than previous protocols. This allowed observation of cellular events during the reprogramming process. Moreover, we demonstrate that overexpression of the Spalt transcription factor, Sall4, which was previously identified as a regulator of embryonic stem cell pluripotency and early mouse development, can enhance reprogramming. The reprogramming activity of Sall4 is independent of an N-terminal domain implicated in recruiting the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase corepressor complex, a global transcriptional repressor. These results indicate that improvements in reprogramming assays, including fusion assays, may allow the systematic identification and molecular characterization of enhancers of somatic cell reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W1980516267,"The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria nearly three billion years ago provided abundant reducing power and facilitated the elaboration of numerous oxygen-dependent reactions in our biosphere. Cyanobacteria contain an internal thylakoid membrane system, the site of photosynthesis, and a typical Gram-negative envelope membrane system. Like other organisms, the extracytoplasmic space in cyanobacteria houses numerous cysteine-containing proteins. However, the existence of a biochemical system for disulfide bond formation in cyanobacteria remains to be determined. Extracytoplasmic disulfide bond formation in non-photosynthetic organisms is catalyzed by coordinated interaction between two proteins, a disulfide carrier and a disulfide generator. Here we describe a novel gene, SyndsbAB, required for disulfide bond formation in the extracytoplasmic space of cyanobacteria. The SynDsbAB orthologs are present in most cyanobacteria and chloroplasts of higher plants with fully sequenced genomes. The SynDsbAB protein contains two distinct catalytic domains that display significant similarity to proteins involved in disulfide bond formation in Escherichia coli and eukaryotes. Importantly, SyndsbAB complements E. coli strains defective in disulfide bond formation. In addition, the activity of E. coli alkaline phosphatase localized to the periplasm of Synechocystis 6803 is dependent on the function of SynDsbAB. Deletion of SyndsbAB in Synechocystis 6803 causes significant growth impairment under photoautotrophic conditions and results in hyper-sensitivity to dithiothreitol, a reductant, whereas diamide, an oxidant had no effect on the growth of the mutant strains. We conclude that SynDsbAB is a critical protein for disulfide bond formation in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms and required for their optimal photoautotrophic growth."
https://openalex.org/W2005847898,"Exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (EPACs) are guanine nucleotide-exchange factors for the small GTPases Rap1 and Rap2 and represent a key receptor for the ubiquitous cAMP second messenger in eukaryotes. The cAMP-dependent activation of apoEPAC is typically rationalized in terms of a preexisting equilibrium between inactive and active states. Structural and mutagenesis analyses have shown that one of the critical determinants of the EPAC activation equilibrium is a cluster of salt bridges formed between the catalytic core and helices α1 and α2 at the N terminus of the cAMP binding domain and commonly referred to as ionic latch (IL). The IL stabilizes the inactive states in a closed topology in which access to the catalytic domain is sterically occluded by the regulatory moiety. However, it is currently not fully understood how the IL is allosterically controlled by cAMP. Chemical shift mapping studies consistently indicate that cAMP does not significantly perturb the structure of the IL spanning sites within the regulatory region, pointing to cAMP-dependent dynamic modulations as a key allosteric carrier of the cAMP-signal to the IL sites. Here, we have therefore investigated the dynamic profiles of the EPAC1 cAMP binding domain in its apo, cAMP-bound, and Rp-cAMPS phosphorothioate antagonist-bound forms using several 15N relaxation experiments. Based on the comparative analysis of dynamics in these three states, we have proposed a model of EPAC activation that incorporates the dynamic features allosterically modulated by cAMP and shows that cAMP binding weakens the IL by increasing its entropic penalty due to dynamic enhancements.

Both EPAC1 and -2 are multidomain proteins with an N-terminal regulatory region (RR), including the cAMP binding domains (CBDs) and a C-terminal catalytic region (CR), containing a CDC25-homology module (CDC25HD) that functions as a guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) (Fig. 1a). In both EPAC isoforms the cAMP dependence of the GEF function is implemented through the CBD at the C terminus of the RR (Fig. 1, a and b) irrespective of the DEP domain, which serves the primary purpose of controlling the membrane localization of EPAC (4Bos J.L.

These CBD structures consistently show that the main conformational change caused by cAMP is a hinge-like rotation of the helix C-terminal to the β-barrel typical of CBDs (17Rehmann H. Prakash B.

Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), which is commonly referred to as hinge helix. When cAMP docks into the binding pocket formed by the phosphate binding cassette (PBC) and the base binding β4-β5 region (BBR), the hinge helix approaches the β-barrel core, bringing the region C-terminal to it (i.e. the lid) in proximity of the PBC (18Rehmann H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Based on structural and mutagenesis data, it has been proposed that this hinge-like cAMP-dependent motion contributes to the displacement of the RR away from the CR, thus removing steric impediments for the access of substrates to the catalytic domain and explaining the cAMP-dependent activation of the GEF function of EPAC (18Rehmann H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This mechanism of EPAC activation has been formalized in terms of an equilibrium between active and inactive states in which the RR and CR are in an open and closed relative orientation, respectively. The cAMP-dependent hinge rotation then promotes a shift of this equilibrium toward the active (open) state (18Rehmann H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 6501-6508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The recently solved structure of apo-EPAC2 (16Rehmann H. Das J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) has also revealed the involvement of the CBD in another fundamental inhibitory mechanism distinct from the hinge rotation. Specifically, the α2 helix in the N-terminal helical bundle (NTHB) of this CBD and the preceding helix (i.e. α1) form a cluster of four salt bridges with the catalytic region. Such a CR/RR salt-bridge cluster is called the ionic latch (IL) (Fig. 1b) and serves two main inhibitory functions. First, it secures the RR and CR in close proximity to each other, sterically blocking the access of effector Rap proteins to the catalytic core (16Rehmann H. Das J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Second, the IL sequesters and shields a critical CR arginine (i.e. Arg-886 in EPAC2m), which has been suggested to be required for the recognition of Rap by EPAC, making it unavailable for a crucial interaction with Rap (16Rehmann H. Das J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A recent site-directed mutagenesis study has shown that the equilibrium between active and inactive states of EPAC is not controlled only by the hinge motion of the CBD C-terminal region but also by the IL (16Rehmann H. Das J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For instance, a deletion mutant (i.e. EPAC2Δ306) in which the IL is weakened through the removal of one of the CR/RR salt bridges displays a striking 5-fold increase in the maximum exchange activity (kmax) (16Rehmann H. Das J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), indicating that the integral IL contributes to shifting the EPAC equilibrium toward the inactive state. However, it is currently not clear how the IL sites located in the N-terminal helical bundle are controlled by cAMP, which docks in the distal PBC and BBR, embedded within the β-subdomain. Considering that previous MS investigations (20Brock M. Fan F. Mei F.C. Li S. Gessner C. Woods Jr., V.L. Cheng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32256-32263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) support the notion that the region spanning the IL is not subject to major conformational perturbations upon cAMP binding, we propose the hypothesis that the IL is allosterically controlled by cAMP through cAMP-dependent changes in dynamics rather than in structure. To test this hypothesis, we have investigated primarily by classical NMR 15N relaxation experiments as well as by multi-offset NMR dispersion measurements the EPAC1h-(149-318) construct in its apo-, cAMP-bound (holo), and Rp-cAMPS-bound states. The EPAC1h-(149-318) segment binds cAMP with an affinity similar to that of full-length EPAC (KD ∼ 4 μm) (21Kraemer A. Rehmann H.R. Cool R.H. Theiss C. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and includes not only the PBC and BBR, where cAMP binds, but also the NTHB and the C-terminal helical hinge region (Fig. 1b) that is allosterically affected by cAMP. Furthermore, EPAC1h-(149-318) includes in full the α1-helix and the three key sites of the ionic latch (i.e. Gln-168, Asp-172, and Glu-197). A similar N-terminal truncation in EPAC2 (i.e. EPAC2Δ280) did not affect the observed kmax (16Rehmann H. Das J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), indicating that such an N-terminal deletion mutation does not impair the ability of the IL sites to form inhibitory interactions with the catalytic core. In addition, we have noticed that the α1-helix with its highly polar N-terminal region (Fig. 1b) ensures excellent solubility in both the presence and absence of ligands resulting in high assignment coverage (i.e. >82%) and in an unprecedented picture of allostery and dynamics unavailable for other eukaryotic CBDs due to inherent instabilities that have hampered direct apo versus holo comparisons (19Harper S.M.

Genet. 2007; 69: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Overall, our combined comparative NMR analysis of dynamic features in the EPAC1 CBD shows that cAMP binding leads to significant modulations of the CBD dynamic profile in several time scales and at multiple allosteric sites, pointing to a critical link between flexibility and function, in general, and to a pivotal entropic determinant for the allosteric propagation of the cAMP signal from its binding pocket to the distal IL region, in particular. Sample Preparation—The human EPAC1 CBD construct EPAC1h-(149-318) was expressed and purified according to previously published protocols (26Mazhab-Jafari M.T. Das R. Fotheringham S.A. SilDas S. Chowdhury S. Melacini G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 14482-14492Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Further details are available in the supplemental materials. NMR Measurements—All spectra were acquired at 34 °C using a 700-MHz spectrometer equipped with a TCI cryo-probe. The temperature was calibrated using both a thermocouple and an ethylene glycol sample. The heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra were acquired with 128 (15N) and 1024 (1H) complex points and spectral widths of 31.8 and 14.2 ppm for the 15N and 1H dimensions, respectively. 1H chemical shifts were calibrated using 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid followed by indirect calibration of the 15N ppm values using the nitrogen to proton gyro-magnetic ratio (27Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice, Academic Press, Inc, New York1996Google Scholar). The carrier frequencies of the proton and nitrogen channels were centered on the H2O resonance and on the middle of the backbone amide region, respectively. 15N was decoupled using the GARP4 pulse train with a 1.32-kHz radio frequency pulse (RF) strength. All two-dimensional spectra were processed using Xwinnmr (Bruker, Inc.) and/or NMRPipe (28Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11554) Google Scholar). Cross-peak fit heights were measured using Sparky 3.111 (29Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY. University of California, San Francisco, CA2006Google Scholar) and Gaussian line fitting unless otherwise specified. The resonance assignments were obtained through standard triple resonance experiments (i.e. HNCO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, CBCA-(CO)NH, HBHA(CO)NH, HNCACB, and HNHAHB) (30Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1389) Google Scholar), whereas the 1H,1H NOEs were measured using NOESY-HSQC spectra (τmix = 150 ms). All three-dimensional spectra were processed using NMRPipe (28Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11554) Google Scholar) and analyzed through Sparky 3.111 (29Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY. University of California, San Francisco, CA2006Google Scholar). The secondary structure probabilities were determined using the secondary chemical shifts via the PECAN software (31Eghbalnia H.R. Bahrami A. Wang L.Y. Assadi A. Markley J.L. J. Biomol. NMR. 2005; 32: 219-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Compounded chemical shifts were computed via the following formula: Δδcompound = ((Δδ1H)2 + (Δδ15N/6.5)2)1/2, where Δδ 1H and Δδ 15N are the differences between the proton and nitrogen chemical shifts, respectively. 15N NMR Relaxation Measurements—The 15N longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates R1 and R2 as well as the {1H} 15N steady state NOEs were measured for 0.1 mm EPAC1h-(149-318) in its apo and Rp-cAMPS- and cAMP-bound forms, with pulse sequences containing water flip back pulses and sensitivity enhancement (32Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Formankay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar, 33Mulder F.A.A.

Spectrosc. 1998; 33: 207-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Before the relaxation experiments the NMR samples were filtered through a 100-kDa cut off filter. For the measurements of R1 relaxation rates the following relaxation delays were employed: 100 (×2), 200, 300, 400 (×2), 500, 600, 800, and 1000 ms (where ×2 indicates duplicate spectra). The offset and duty cycle-compensated 15N R2 CPMG experiments (39Yip G.N.B. Zuiderweg E.R.P. J. Magn. Reson. 2004; 171: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) were measured with a vCPMG of 472 Hz (40Tollinger M. Skrynnikov N.R. Mulder F.A.A. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 11341-11352Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 41Mulder F.A.A. Skrynnikov N.R. Hon B. Dahlquist F.W. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and CPMG relaxation delays of 8.48, 16.96, 25.44, 33.92, 42.4, 50.88, 59.36, 76.32, and 93.28 ms. For the NOE experiments, a 10-s recycle delay was used that included a 5-s proton saturation period, whereas a recycle delay of 1.5 s was used for the R1 and R2 experiments. The stability of the protein sample was monitored before and after each relaxation experiment via HSQC spectra. To average potential long term instabilities, the entire series of R1 and R2 relaxation rates were run in duplicate or triplicate (42Mulder F.A.A. Schipper D. Bott R. Boelens R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and the {1H}-15N steady state NOEs were collected in 9 or 10 sets of saturated and unsaturated spectra. All spectra were co-added before processing using NMRPipe, resulting in a total of 48 or 72 scans per serial file at each T2 CPMG length, 32 or 48 scans per serial file at each T1 inversion recovery delay, and 36 or 40 scans per serial file for each NOE experiment (with and without 1H saturation). The number of dummy scans was always 96 or higher. The 15N and 1H frequencies in the relaxation experiments were digitized with the same number of points as in the HSQC experiments described above. The errors for R1 and R2 were evaluated using Gaussian distributed random noise. The steady state NOE values were computed as the ratio of the intensities in saturated to unsaturated spectra. The STDV of the distribution of the differences in fit heights between duplicate spectra was used to estimate the errors of the steady state NOE values (32Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Formankay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). All errors were conservatively treated as previously explained (43Kroenke C.D. Rance M. Palmer A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 10119-10125Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Selected cross-peaks were not included in the relaxation analyses due to line broadening and/or overlap. Reduced Spectral Density Mapping—The 15N relaxation data were mapped into reduced spectral densities under the assumption that their high frequency values do not vary: J(ωN + ωH) = J(ωH) = J(ωN - ωH), as previously explained (44Atkinson R.A. Kieffer B. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2004; 44: 141-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 45Houben K. Wasielewski E. Dominguez C. Kellenberger E. Atkinson R.A.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2674-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Assuming these equalities, it is possible to compute the J(ωN + ωH) and J(ωN) values only from the measured 15NR1 and {1H}15N NOEs, whereas the J(0) values are derived from the measured 15NR2 rates as well (47Lefevre J.F. Dayie K.T. Peng J.W. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2674-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The value of J(0) calculated in this way also includes contributions from chemical exchange. Error propagation was employed to estimate the errors in the reduced spectral densities starting from the uncertainties in the measured 15N relaxation rates and NOEs. Hydrodynamic Simulations—The contributions to the relaxation rates and to the reduced spectral densities arising from the overall tumbling and from the effect of diffusion anisotropy were evaluated through hydrodynamic simulations based on the bead method using the HYDRONMR program (48Bernado P. de la Torre J.G. Pons M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 23: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 49de la Torre J.G. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 93: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For this purpose the coordinates of several CBD-spanning fragments of the Protein Data Bank code 2BYV structure of EPAC2m (16Rehmann H. Das J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) were utilized (supplemental Table S1). In all simulations hydrogen atoms were added through the program Molmol (50Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar), and the atomic element radius was 3.3 Å, which has been previously shown to best fit multiple hydrodynamic properties (i.e. translational diffusion, sedimentation coefficients, rotational diffusion, and intrinsic viscosity) in a set of model proteins (49de la Torre J.G. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 93: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All HYDRONMR computations were carried out at a temperature of 307 K and the water viscosity in centipoises (cP) was calculated as: η = 1.7753 - 0.0565t + 1.0751 × 10-3t2 - 9.2222 × 10-6t3, where t is the temperature in Celsius (49de la Torre J.G. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 93: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The HYDRONMR-computed 15N relaxation rates at a static field of 16.44 tesla assume an N-H distance of 1.02 Å and a chemical shift anisotropy of -160 ppm (40Tollinger M. Skrynnikov N.R. Mulder F.A.A.

Soc. 2001; 123: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The Dpar/Dper ratios in supplemental Table S1 were calculated as 2Dz/(Dx + Dy), in which Dx and Dy are the two eigenvalues of the rotational diffusion matrix that are closest to each other (48Bernado P. de la Torre J.G. Pons M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 23: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 49de la Torre J.G. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 93: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Relaxation Dispersion NMR—The 15N relaxation dispersions for backbone amides in the cAMP- and the Rp-cAMPS-bound and apo states of EPAC1h-(149-318) were measured using a constant-time relaxation-compensated CPMG pulse sequence (40Tollinger M. Skrynnikov N.R. Mulder F.A.A. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 11341-11352Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 41Mulder F.A.A. Skrynnikov N.R. Hon B. Dahlquist F.W.

Method Enzymol. 2001; 339: 204-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). During the total CPMG length (TCP) of 93.3 ms, either 8 or 88 180° 15N pulses were implemented, resulting in CPMG field strengths (νCPMG) of 43 and 472 Hz, respectively (40Tollinger M. Skrynnikov N.R. Mulder F.A.A. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 11341-11352Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 41Mulder F.A.A. Skrynnikov N.R. Hon B. Dahlquist F.W.

Method Enzymol. 2001; 339: 204-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Six interleaved replicate data sets were recorded and co-added for each CPMG field strength. 128 dummy scans and 16 scans were accumulated per serial file with an interscan delay of 2.2 s. Because of the presence of significant offset effects for the 15N pulses at 700 MHz and at the CPMG RF (radio frequency pulse) strength employed (3.1 kHz), all constant-time relaxation-compensated CPMG experiments were acquired with three different 15N carrier frequencies (110, 119, and 127 ppm) to cover the 15N spectral width through three narrow frequency bands. The NMR relaxation dispersion (ΔR2eff) was computed using the equation ΔR2eff = (1/TCP) ln(I472Hz/I43Hz), where IνCPMG is the cross-peak intensity with a CPMG strength νCPMG. NMR dispersion could not be measured for cross-peaks affected by overlap and/or relaxing too quickly to be detected in the relaxation-compensated constant-time CPMG spectra (e.g. several residues in the α3 region). Sequence and Structure Analyses—Sequence alignments were performed with ClustalW (52Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55720) Google Scholar), whereas Pymol (53DeLano W. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. De Lano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar) and/or Molmol (50Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar) were used for the structural analyses. No Major cAMP-dependent Local Structural Changes Are Observed for the Residues of EPAC1h-(149-318) Spanning the Ionic Latch—The cAMP-dependent structural changes of EPAC1h-(149-318) were probed through the 1H15N-compounded chemical shift variations caused by cAMP (Fig. 1, c and d) and the secondary chemical shift-based α-helix and β-strand probabilities measured for both the apo and cAMP-bound states (Fig. 2, a and b).

We used the prototype arterivirus, equine arteritis virus (EAV), to gain insight into the structure and function of the replication/transcription complex (RTC) of nidoviruses. RTCs were isolated from EAV-infected cells, and their activity was studied using a newly developed in vitro assay for viral RNA synthesis, which reproduced the synthesis of both viral genome and subgenomic mRNAs. A detailed characterization of this system and its reaction products is described. RTCs isolated from cytoplasmic extracts by differential centrifugation were inactive unless supplemented with a cytosolic host protein factor, which, according to subsequent size fractionation analysis, has a molecular mass in the range of 59–70 kDa. This host factor was found to be present in a wide variety of eukaryotes. Several EAV replicase subunits cosedimented with newly made viral RNA in a heavy membrane fraction that contained all RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. This fraction contained the characteristic double membrane vesicles (DMVs) that were previously implicated in EAV RNA synthesis and could be immunolabeled for EAV nonstructural proteins (nsps). Replicase subunits directly involved in viral RNA synthesis (nsp9 and nsp10) or DMV formation (nsp2 and nsp3) exclusively cosedimented with the active RTC. Subgenomic mRNAs appeared to be released from the complex, whereas newly made genomic RNA remained more tightly associated.

Positive strand RNA viruses form the largest group of animal viruses and include many important human pathogens, like poliovirus, hepatitis A and C virus, dengue virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, and various human coronaviruses. Although these viruses differ in many aspects of their biology, including genome size, organization, and expression strategy, they are united by the fact that their RNA genome is replicated by cytoplasmic enzyme complexes. These complexes are associated with virus-induced membrane structures that are derived from host cell organelles (for reviews, see Refs. 1Mackenzie J.

Such membrane structures might function as scaffold for the replication machinery, provide a suitable microenvironment for viral RNA synthesis, serve to recruit membrane-bound host proteins, and/or provide protection against the host cell's antiviral responses (e.g. RNA degradation or responses triggered by the double-stranded RNA intermediates of viral RNA synthesis).Nidoviruses (corona-, roni-, and arteriviruses) have exceptionally large polycistronic RNA genomes and employ a unique transcription mechanism to produce a nested set of subgenomic (sg) 2The abbreviations used are: sg, subgenomic; DMV, double membrane vesicle; MHV, mouse hepatitis virus; EAV, equine arteritis virus; RTC, replication/transcription complex; nsp, nonstructural protein; ORF, open reading frame; RI, replicative intermediate; RF, replicative form; IVRA, in vitro RNA synthesis assay; ActD, actinomycin D; ssRNA, single-stranded RNA; RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; DTT, dithiothreitol; PNS, postnuclear supernatant. 2The abbreviations used are: sg, subgenomic; DMV, double membrane vesicle; MHV, mouse hepatitis virus; EAV, equine arteritis virus; RTC, replication/transcription complex; nsp, nonstructural protein; ORF, open reading frame; RI, replicative intermediate; RF, replicative form; IVRA, in vitro RNA synthesis assay; ActD, actinomycin D; ssRNA, single-stranded RNA; RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; DTT, dithiothreitol; PNS, postnuclear supernatant. mRNAs.

In nidovirus-infected cells, newly synthesized viral RNA and many replicase subunits were found to colocalize in discrete foci in the perinuclear region (6Ng L.F. Liu D.X. J.

Electron microscopy of this area revealed the presence of large numbers of typical paired membranes and double membrane vesicles (DMVs) (9van der Meer Y. Snijder E.J. Dobbe J.C. Schleich S.

For the coronaviruses mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS coronavirus and the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV), immunoelectron microscopy revealed that both viral nonstructural proteins (nsps) presumed to be part of the replication/transcription complex (RTC) and de novo made viral RNA are associated with these membranes (9van der Meer Y.

Virol. 2002; 76: 3697-3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Based on these results, DMVs have been postulated to carry the enzyme complex that is responsible for nidovirus replication and sg mRNA synthesis.One of the best studied nidovirus models is the arterivirus prototype EAV, which has been used extensively to study both replicase functions and the mechanism of nidovirus RNA synthesis. Of the 12.7-kb EAV genome (RNA1), 75% is occupied by the large replicase gene that consists of the open reading frames 1a and 1b (ORF1a and ORF1b). The EAV replication cycle starts with the translation of RNA1 to synthesize two large replicase polyproteins: the 1727-amino acid ORF1a-encoded pp1a and the 3175-amino acid pp1ab, which is synthesized after a -1 ribosomal frameshift that occurs immediately upstream of the ORF1a termination codon and results in the extension of pp1a with the ORF1b-encoded part of the replicase (reviewed in Ref. 26Snijder E.J. Meulenberg J.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 961-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Subsequently, pp1a and pp1ab undergo extensive autoproteolytic processing by three ORF1a-encoded proteases, which leads to the generation of 13 end products (nsps), named nsp1 to nsp12 (a recently described cleavage within nsp7 yields nsp7α and nsp7β (27Van Aken D. Zevenhoven-Dobbe J. Gorbalenya A.E. Snijder E.J. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 3473-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)). Most of these replicase subunits appear to become associated with intracellular membranes in the perinuclear region of the infected cell (11van der Meer Y. van Tol H. Locker J.K. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6689-6698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Pedersen K.W. van der Meer Y. Roos N. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2016-2026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13van Dinten L.C. Wassenaar A.L. Gorbalenya A.E. Spaan W.J. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6625-6633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where they are thought to assemble into RTCs. The ORF1b-encoded subunits contain the core enzymatic activities that are involved in viral RNA synthesis, like the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and RNA helicase (28Seybert A. van Dinten L.C. Snijder E.J. Ziebuhr J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9586-9593Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 29Beerens N. Selisko B. Ricagno S. Imbert I. van der Zanden L. Snijder E.J. Canard B. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 8384-8395Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas ORF1a encodes, in addition to the three protease domains, several putative transmembrane subunits. The latter appear to play a more “structural” role by inducing DMV formation (30Snijder E.J. van Tol H. Roos N. Pedersen K.W. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 985-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and presumably anchoring the RTC to intracellular membranes (11van der Meer Y. van Tol H. Locker J.K. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6689-6698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In EAV-infected cells, the RTC mediates the synthesis of genomic RNA (RNA1) and a nested set of six sg mRNAs (RNA2–RNA7). These transcripts are 3′-co-terminal and also contain a common 211-nucleotide 5′-leader sequence that is identical to the 5′-end of RNA1. Each sg mRNA is thought to be produced from its own subgenome-length minus strand template. The latter are produced via a mechanism of discontinuous minus strand RNA synthesis, during which sequences encoding sg RNA “leader” and “body” are joined (for recent reviews, see Refs. 5Sawicki S.G. Sawicki D.L. Siddell S.G. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar and 31Pasternak A.O. Spaan W.J. Snijder E.J. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 1403-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The production of a set of sg transcripts is a characteristic feature of nidoviruses and serves to regulate the expression of the viral structural protein genes from the 3′-proximal part of the genome. Therefore, their synthesis is referred to as “transcription,” to distinguish it from the process of replication. Viral RNA synthesis involves partially and fully double-stranded intermediates, known as replicative intermediates (RIs) and replicative forms (RFs), which are thought to be associated with plus and minus strand RNA synthesis, respectively (32Sawicki S.G. Sawicki D.L. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1050-1056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Franklin R.M. J. Virol. 1967; 1: 64-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The isolation of replication complexes and the development of in vitro RNA synthesis assays (IVRAs) have proven to be valuable tools for studying the mechanistic details of the replication of several viruses. However, robust in vitro systems supporting the synthesis of the full spectrum of viral RNAs produced in nidovirus-infected cells have not been described, and therefore we set out to develop such a system for EAV. The purification of active, membrane-associated RTCs should enhance our insight into their structure and function, including the molecular details of nidovirus replication and transcription. We now describe the development, optimization, and characterization of such an in vitro system for EAV, in which both genome-sized and sg RNAs, mainly of positive polarity, were synthesized. The characterization of partially purified and enzymatically active RTCs revealed that several EAV nsps, including the nsp9-RdRp, cosedimented with endogenous and newly synthesized viral RNA in fractions that contained double membrane structures. Subgenomic mRNAs appeared to be released from the RTC-containing fraction, whereas a large proportion of newly synthesized genomic RNA remained associated with it. Remarkably, the isolated RTC was not active unless it was supplemented with a preparation containing a cytosolic host protein factor. This host factor was found to be present in a wide variety of eukaryotes, and its preliminary characterization indicated that it has a molecular mass in the range between 59 and 70 kDa.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells, Virus, and Antisera—BHK-21 cells were cultured and infected with EAV (Bucyrus strain) at a multiplicity of infection of 5, essentially as described (34de Vries A.A. Chirnside E.D. Horzinek M.C. Rottier P.J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6294-6303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that cells were grown in Glasgow minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5 or 2% fetal calf serum before and after infection, respectively. HeLa cells and Vero E6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. C6/36 cells were grown as described (35Igarashi A. J. Gen. Virol. 1978; 40: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). One-day old deyolked zebrafish embryos were obtained from Christoph Bagowski (Department of Integrative Zoology, Institute of Biology, Leiden University). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain FY1679 was grown in YPD. A new nsp9 rabbit antiserum was raised against bacterially expressed recombinant nsp9 (29Beerens N. Selisko B. Ricagno S. Imbert I. van der Zanden L. Snijder E.J. Canard B. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 8384-8395Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The other antisera used in this study have been described previously (12Pedersen K.W. van der Meer Y. Roos N. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2016-2026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Snijder E.J. Wassenaar A.L. Spaan W.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5755-5764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37van Dinten L.C. Rensen S. Gorbalenya A.E. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2027-2037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Isolation of Enzymatically Active RTCs from EAV-infected Cells—Approximately 1 × 108 EAV-infected BHK-21 cells were harvested by trypsinization at 6 h postinfection, when infection was carried out at the commonly used temperature of 39.5 °C, or 10 h postinfection when infection was done at 37 °C. Cells were resuspended in 2 ml of hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgOAc, 1 mm DTT, 133 units/ml RNaseOUT (Invitrogen), and 2 μg/ml actinomycin D (ActD), pH 7.4). During harvesting and lysis, 2 μg/ml ActD was present in all solutions used. The number of harvested cells was determined using a counting chamber, and the percentage of infected cells was checked by immunofluorescence microscopy as described (11van der Meer Y. van Tol H. Locker J.K. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6689-6698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation on ice in hypotonic buffer for 15 min, cells were disrupted in an ice-cold ball bearing homogenizer (Isobiotek) with 16-μm clearance. HEPES, sucrose, and DTT were added to yield a lysate containing 35 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 8 mm KCl, 2.5 mm DTT, 1 mm MgOAc, 2 μg/ml ActD, and 130 units/ml RNaseOUT. Nuclei, large debris, and any remaining intact cells were then removed by two subsequent centrifugation steps at 1000 × g and 4 °C for 5 min, and the postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was either assayed immediately for RdRp activity or stored at -80 °C, at which activity could be retained for at least 1 year. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent.In Vitro RNA Synthesis Assay (IVRA)—Following optimization of reaction conditions (as described under “Results”), standard 28-μl IVRA mixtures contained 25 μl of EAV-infected cell lysate (either PNS, S10, P10, or combinations), 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 220 mm sucrose, 7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm DTT, 2.5 mm MgOAc, 2 μg/ml ActD, 25 units of RNaseOUT, 20 mm creatine phosphate (Sigma), 10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase (Sigma), 1 mm ATP, 0.25 mm GTP, 0.25 mm UTP, 0.6 μm CTP, and 0.12 μm, 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (GE Healthcare). Unless otherwise indicated, standard reactions were performed for 100 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 60 μl of 5% lithium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.5 m LiCl, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K, pH 8.0. After an incubation of 15 min at 42 °C, unincorporated label was removed using RNase-free Micro Bio-spin 30 columns (Bio-Rad), and RNA was isolated, dissolved in 20 μl of 1 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.5, and analyzed as described below.Isolation, Gel Electrophoresis, and Detection of RNA—RNA was isolated by acid phenol extraction and isopropyl alcohol precipitation with GlycoBlue (Ambion) as coprecipitant, essentially as described (38van Marle G. van Dinten L.C. Spaan W.J. Luytjes W. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5274-5281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis was performed as described (39van Marle G. Dobbe J.C. Gultyaev A.P. Luytjes W. Spaan W.J. Snijder E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12056-12061Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Semidenaturing 7 m urea, 3% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed essentially as described (40Chu P.W. Westaway E.G. Virology. 1985; 140: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Before loading, samples were either incubated at 42 °C for 15 min or heat-denatured for 3 min at 96 °C, followed by rapid cooling on ice. For detection of IVRA products, PhosphorImager screens were directly exposed to dried gels, after which screens were scanned with a Personal Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad), and incorporation of label was quantified using Quantity One version 4.5.1 software. Incorporation of [α-32P]CTP was quantified by correlating the measurements to those from membrane strips containing known quantities of [α-32P]CTP. For the detection of unlabeled EAV RNA, direct hybridization of agarose gels was performed (39van Marle G. Dobbe J.C. Gultyaev A.P. Luytjes W. Spaan W.J. Snijder E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12056-12061Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) using a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (5′-TTGGTTCCTGGGTGGCTAATAACTACTT-3′) that is complementary to the 3′-end of all EAV mRNAs. For quantitative analysis, known quantities of in vitro transcripts were run on the same gel.Hybridization of IVRA Products—In vitro transcribed RNAs (1 μg) corresponding to the ORF7 region (nucleotides 12313–12660) of the EAV genome (RNA7+) or its complementary sequence (RNA7-) were immobilized to Hybond N+ membrane (GE Healthcare). Equal amounts of total cellular RNA isolated from mouse L cells and full-length Sindbis virus RNA transcripts were included as negative controls. The membrane with the immobilized probes was hybridized (0.8-ml volume; 16 h at 60 °C) with half of the 32P-labeled RNA recovered from a 28-μl IVRA. Membranes were washed twice for 20 min at 60 °C with 4 ml of 15 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% SDS, pH 7.0. To confirm the specificity of the immobilized probes, membranes were also hybridized with either 32P-labeled RNA7+ or 32P-labeled RNA7- transcript. Hybridization was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis as described above.LiCl Fractionation and RNase Treatment of IVRA Products— IVRA reactions were terminated with lithium dodecyl sulfate and proteinase K as described above. After removal of unincorporated label, the LiCl concentration was raised to 2 m, and samples were incubated at -20 °C for 16 h (40Chu P.W. Westaway E.G. Virology. 1985; 140: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). RI and ssRNA were pelleted by centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000 × g and 4 °C. Pellets were washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and dissolved in 1 mm sodium citrate. The 2 m LiCl supernatant was desalted using Micro Bio-spin 30 columns (Bio-Rad). Samples were treated with a mix of RNase A (2.5 units/ml) and RNase T1 (100 units/ml) under low salt conditions (15 mm NaCl, 2 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.2) or high salt conditions (750 mm NaCl, 75 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.2) for 15 min at 37 °C. Double-stranded RNA was specifically degraded by incubation with RNase III (Ambion; 50 units/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C in 650 mm NaCl, 60 mm sodium citrate, 10 mm MgOAc, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. After RNase treatment, RNA was isolated as described above, except that the phenol extraction step was omitted.Subcellular Fractionation by Differential Centrifugation, Ultrafiltration, and Size Exclusion Chromatography—PNS fractions of BHK-21, HeLa, Vero E6, and C6/36 cells were prepared by mechanical disruption as described above for EAV-infected BHK-21 cells. A yeast PNS and a zebrafish PNS were prepared in a similar way except that yeast cells from a 50-ml culture were disrupted by vortexing in the presence of 500-μm diameter glass beads in 0.5 ml of hypotonic buffer, and zebrafish cells from 200 1-day-old zebrafish embryos were disrupted in 200 μl of hypotonic buffer by passing them through a 27-gauge needle. The total protein concentration in all lysates was between 1 and 5 mg/ml. PNS fractions were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 5,000 × g, 10,000 × g, and 16,000 × g, yielding supernatants S5, S10, and S16 and pellets P5, P10, and P16, respectively. Pellets were resuspended in dilution buffer (35 mm HEPES, 250 mm sucrose, 8 mm KCl, 2.5 mm DTT, 1 mm MgOAc, pH 7.4) by carefully pipetting (20 times) in one-fifth to one-tenth of the volume of the PNS from which the pellet was prepared. For IVRAs, 5 μl of a pellet fraction was mixed with either 20 μl of dilution buffer or 20 μl of a “supernatant fraction”, after which reactions were performed as described above. The S16 fraction was centrifuged for 1 h at 200,000 × g to yield a S200 supernatant fraction. Low molecular mass compounds (<6 kDa) were removed from S16 by size exclusion chromatography using Micro Bio-spin 6 columns (Bio-Rad), yielding fraction F>6. Ultrafiltration of S16 through filters with cut-off sizes of 10 kDa (Millipore Biomax 10K NMWL), 100 kDa (Millipore Biomax 100K NMWL), and 1000 kDa (Vivascience Vivaspin 1,000,000 MWCO) yielded filtrates F<10, F<100, and F<1000, respectively.Gel Filtration Chromatography—A HeLa S200 fraction (240 μg of protein in 200 μl) was fractionated by gel filtration chromatography using an AKTA FPLC (GE Healthcare) and a Superdex 200 HR10/30 column (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C. The column was equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm MgOAc. Elution was done in the same buffer, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected after the first 7 ml (which represented the void volume of the column). For each fraction, the buffer was exchanged to dilution buffer using Micro Bio-spin 6 desalting columns (Bio-Rad). The Superdex column was calibrated with the HMW calibration kit (GE Healthcare) to obtain size estimates for the protein fractions obtained.Protease and Nuclease Treatment—Fraction S16 was treated for 15 min at 30 °C with 2, 0.4, 0.08, and 0 mg/ml proteinase K, after which the protease was inactivated by adding 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and samples were cleaned up with Micro Bio-spin 6 columns (Bio-Rad). Inactivation of proteinase K by this procedure was confirmed by testing the stability of 35S-labeled control proteins during a 100-min incubation. S16 was treated with 75 units/ml microccocal nuclease (Fermentas) in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 for 30 min at 30 °C, after which the nuclease was inactivated by the addition of 5 mm EGTA. The extent of RNA degradation was monitored using a [3H]uridine-labeled in vitro transcript.SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (GE Healthcare) by semidry blotting. Membranes were blocked with 1% casein in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and were incubated with monospecific anti-EAV replicase rabbit antisera: anti-nsp1 (1:2000), anti-nsp2 (1:2000), anti-nsp3 (1:2000), anti-nsp4 (1:2000), anti-nsp7–8 (1:2000), anti-nsp9 (1:5000), or anti-nsp10 (1:2000) antisera, all diluted in PBST containing 0.5% casein and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG antibody (DAKO) and the ECL-plus kit (GE Healthcare) were used for detection. The SilverQuest kit (Invitrogen) was used for silver staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels.Electron Microscopy—Formvar-coated grids were placed on top of 25-μl drops of P10 fractions and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, grids were incubated with a rabbit anti-nsp3 or preimmune serum (1:200) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min, and bound rabbit IgG was detected with 15-nm protein A-gold. After fixation with 1.5% glutaraldehyde and negative staining with 3% uranyl acetate, grids were viewed with a Philips CM-10 transmission electron microscope at 100 kV. For ultrastructural analysis of native DMVs, EAV-infected BHK-21 cells grown on coverslips (Thermanox) were cryofixed by high speed plunge freezing in liquid ethane, freeze substitution, and embedding in LX-112 epoxy resin. 3K.

https://openalex.org/W1984485637,"Under anoxia a coordinated, cytoprotective program is induced, called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is a mediator of the UPR and activates a gene expression program, promoting tumour growth and survival under anoxia. A key gene induced by ATF4 under normoxic conditions is SKIP3. We characterized the induction of SKIP3 during anoxic exposure to determine whether UPR alone was sufficient or there was a more complex regulatory response to anoxia. There was temporal separation of acute hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α- and chronic ATF4-dependent gene expression programs. SKIP3 was regulated by chronic (48 h) rather than acute anoxia (<24 h) by a complex set of pathways and mechanisms, besides ATF4 induced by the classical UPR, there was transcriptional regulation by nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and RNA stabilization by HuR. Temporal activation of the NF-κB pathway under anoxia protected cells from negative consequences of the oxygen stress and involved the canonical signalling pathways that promote IκBA phosphorylation and degradation, and reduced mRNA level of the inhibitory protein IκBA followed by the translational repression of IκBA. We also show that SKIP3 acts as an inhibitor of NF-κB and ATF4-dependent transcription under anoxia and provides a regulatory feedback loop. Repression of the survival pathway NF-κB by SKIP3 sensitized cells to metabolic consequences of the anoxic stress. Thus, the response to anoxia is mediated by three pathways independently of HIF, suggesting that combined therapeutic approaches would be needed to maximize effects against this pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1998507474,"Interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha) is capable of driving pro-inflammatory gene expression through both the initiation of transcription and by prolonging the half-life of short-lived mRNAs. Although the signaling events linking the IL-1 receptor to the activation of NFkappaB and the initiation of transcription have been well characterized, less is known about the signaling events linking to mRNA stabilization. As a model to study the control of mRNA stability we have used the mouse chemokine KC, expression of which requires both NFkappaB-driven transcription and stabilization of the constitutively unstable mRNA. We have evaluated the role of signaling adaptors known to play a role in IL-1alpha-driven NFkappaB activation in the generation of mRNA stability. Surprisingly, although TRAF6 is essential for NFkappaB activation, it is not required for IL-1alpha-induced mRNA stabilization. IRAK1, which is recognized to function upstream of TRAF6, is required for both mRNA stabilization and activation of NFkappaB. Consistent with the previous findings, the TRAF6 interaction sites in IRAK1 are required for NFkappaB activation but do not play a role in mRNA stabilization. These findings indicate that signals from the IL-1 receptor segregate into at least two separate pathways at the level of IRAK1; one couples through TRAF6 to NFkappaB activation while a second utilizes a TRAF6-independent pathway that is responsible for mRNA stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2046869450,"Gephyrin is a multifunctional protein involved in the clustering of inhibitory neuroreceptors. In addition, gephyrin catalyzes the last step in molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis essential for the activities of Mo-dependent enzymes such as sulfite oxidase and xanthine oxidoreductase. Functional complexity and diversity of gephyrin is believed to be regulated by alternative splicing in a tissue-specific manner. Here, we investigated eight gephyrin variants with combinations of seven alternatively spliced exons located in the N-terminal G domain, the central domain, and the C-terminal E domain. Their activity in Moco synthesis was analyzed in vivo by reconstitution of gephyrin-deficient L929 cells, which were found to be defective in the G domain of gephyrin. Individual domain functions were assayed in addition and confirmed that variants containing either an additional C5 cassette or missing the C6 cassette are inactive in Moco synthesis. In contrast, different alterations within the central domain retained the Moco synthetic activity of gephyrin. The recombinant gephyrin G domain containing the C5 cassette forms dimers in solution, binds molybdopterin, but is unable to catalyze molybdopterin (MPT) adenylylation. Determination of Moco and MPT content in different tissues showed that besides liver and kidney, brain was capable of synthesizing Moco most efficiently.

Interacting sites known from crystal structures were found to be important for gephyrin clustering (11Saiyed T. Paarmann I. Schmitt B. Haeger S. Sola M. Schmalzing G. Weissenhorn W. Betz H. J. Biol.

Besides the specialized function in neurons, gephyrin has a fundamental role in basic metabolism, catalyzing the final steps in molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis (2Feng G. Tintrup H. Kirsch J.

Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2792-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Moco contains a unique pyranopterin backbone with a terminal phosphate and a dithiolate group chelating the molybdenum (14Schwarz G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2792-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A deficiency of Moco results in early childhood death due to severe neuro-degeneration (15Reiss J. Johnson J.L. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 21: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of Moco can be divided into four major steps starting with GTP (14Schwarz G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2792-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The first two reactions generate the pterin backbone of the cofactor commonly referred to as molybdopterin (MPT). In animals, the last two steps, essential for molybdenum insertion, are catalyzed by gephyrin. The reaction mechanism has been uncovered for the gephyrin-homologous plant protein Cnx1, where the G domain binds MPT and catalyzes an adenylyl transfer to the terminal phosphate of MPT (16Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 17Llamas A. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol.

Adenylylated MPT (MPT-AMP) is subsequently transferred to the E domain in a molybdate-dependent manner. Metal insertion is coupled to Zn-assisted hydrolysis of MPT-AMP (18Llamas A. Otte T. Multhaup G. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18343-18350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Although in gephyrin the domains are inverted and connected by a much larger central domain (C domain), the same mechanism of Moco synthesis is expected for gephyrin (Fig. 1A), as it is able to reconstitute Cnx1 function (13Stallmeyer B.

Finally, it is important to note that before molybdenum is inserted, a copper atom (Cu1+) 4G. Schwarz, unpublished results. is bound by MPT and released upon molybdenum transfer (16Kuper J. Llamas A.

The nomenclature of these exons shows some irregularities because of different and independent identification. It is remarkable that except for two cases, all resulting mRNAs express full-length gephyrins without early termination. Gephyrin isoforms with the C2 and C6 cassette or an additional C4 exon in the C domain are the most common and first described variants (17Llamas A. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol.

Here, we studied the Moco biosynthetic activity of eight gephyrin splice variants isolated from rat spinal cord (20Meier J. De Chaldee M. Triller A. Vannier C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C), by functional reconstitution of L929 cells, a gephyrin-deficient line for which we found a defect in the G domain of gephyrin (GephG). Individual domain functions were investigated in Escherichia coli mogA and moeA mutants. Both experiments demonstrated that C2 and C6 cassettes are essential for the gephyrin enzymatic function; cassettes in the C domain had no significant affect on the activity while the insertion of C5 resulted in a loss of GephG activity. Finally, we demonstrated that high levels of Moco are synthesized in brain, which was traced back to glial cells expressing metabolically active gephyrin variants.

Transfection of GFP-tagged gephyrin constructs (pEGFP-N1-Geph2,6, -Geph2,3,6, -Geph2,4,6, -Geph2,5,6, -Geph2,4′,6, -Geph2,4,5,6, -Geph2) was performed with a nucleofector device (Nucleofector™ II, Amaxa Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After transfection, cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells per nine 6-cm2 dishes and fixed 24 h later with 4% paraformaldehyde. GFP fluorescence was visualized by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (Leica DM TCS SP2). Determination of MPT and Moco Content in L929 Cells— Gephyrin domain constructs (pEGFP-C2-Geph2,6, -Geph2,4,6-EE, -Geph-GCE3/4, -Geph-E, -Geph-GC, and pcDNA3-Geph2,6), gephyrin splice variants (pEGFPN1-Geph2,6, -Geph2,3,6, -Geph2,4,6, -Geph2,5,6, -Geph2,4′,6, -Geph2,4,5,6, -Geph1,2,4′,5,6, -Geph2), and empty pEGFP-C2 vector were transiently expressed in L929 cells, grown as described above. Cells were seeded at a density of 5.4 × 105 cells on 85-mm plates, transfected with EFFECTENE (Qiagen), harvested after 48 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and sonicated in 100–200 μl of nit-1 buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA). For the determination of Moco and MPT, 3–30 μl of crude extract were incubated with 20 μl of Neurospora crassa nit-1 extract supplemented with 2 mm reduced glutathione.

The expression level of each sample was analyzed by Western blot. Aliquots of equally expressed proteins were used for the determination of Moco by nit-1 reconstitution using 5–15 μl of crude protein extract and 25 μl of desalted nit-1 extract.

Adenylylation was induced with 0.5 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2, final concentration. The reaction was stopped at different time points by acidic iodine oxidation of MPT and MPT-AMP. Based on the formation of the fluorescent products FormA and FormA-AMP, the content of MPT and MPT-AMP was quantified by HPLC analysis as described (17Llamas A. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol.

After hybridization and cloning, antibody producing hybridoma cells were screened for their binding to holo-gephyrin as well as the individual domains by ELISA. Supernatants were grown either according to standard protocols or in serum-free medium in the presence of 500 mg/liter albumin and 10 mg/liter transferrin. The resulting mAb3B11 was used as culture supernatant. Cortex Cell Culture—Cortical cultures were prepared from E19 Wistar rats. All animals were sacrificed according to the permit (LaGeSo, 0122/07) given by the Office for Health Protection and Technical Safety of the regional government of Berlin and obeyed the rules laid down in the European Community Council Directive. For glia-free cortical neuron cultures, cells were plated at an initial density of 75,000 cells/cm2 and maintained for 2 weeks in Neurobasal medium, supplemented with 2% B27 (30Brewer G.J.

To inhibit glia cell proliferation, 5 μm 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine was added 2 days after plating. For neuron-free glia cultures cells were plated at an initial density of 40,000 cells/cm2 and maintained for 2 weeks in glycine-free Earle's minimal essential medium (MEM), supplemented with 0.25 mm glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 30 mm glucose, 0.23 mm Na+-pyruvate, 0.05% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Invitrogen). Harvested cell pellets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer and sonicated in nit-1 buffer. Crude extracts were anaerobically concentrated with a 3-kDa concentrator (Amicon) to a protein concentration of approximately 10 mg/ml (with exception of the neuron-sample) and used for the nit-1 reconstitution assay. Transcript Analysis of Gephyrin Splice Variants—Gephyrin splicing was analyzed in neurons and glia cells as previously described (31Meier J. Grantyn R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1398-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 32Meier J. Juttner R. Kirischuk S. Grantyn R. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2002; 21: 324-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, primers were designed to bind to the vicinity of either C2 and C5 (gephyrin ±C5: GAGTCCTCACAGTGAGTGATA & TCAAGTTCATCATGCACCTCC, yielding 537/498 bp; respectively), C3 and C4 (gephyrin C3/C4: GGAGGTGCATGATGAACTTGA & TTGCTGCTGCACCTGGACTG, yielding -/-: 356 bp, -/+: 398 bp, +/-: 464 bp, respectively), or C6 (gephyrin +/-C6: GCATCAGTAAAAGATGGCTATG & GGTCATCTTCAGGATTTAGTAG, yielding 441/321 bp, respectively). The presence of these cassettes was determined on the basis of size comparison with PCR products of identified gephyrin clones (20Meier J. De Chaldee M. Triller A. Vannier C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PCR products of the fragments containing one of the C4 cassettes were further characterized by DNA sequencing. Mapping the Gephyrin Defect in L929 Cells—L929 cells are gephyrin-deficient mouse fibroblasts (13Stallmeyer B. Schwarz G. Schulze J. Nerlich A. Reiss J. Kirsch J. Mendel R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1333-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). First, EGFP-tagged full-length gephyrin (Geph2,6) as well as domain constructs encoding GephG with the central domain (Geph-GC) and subdomains 3 and 4 of the GephE (Geph-GCE3/4), GephE (Geph-E) and a chimeric construct containing a second E domain fused to the C terminus of gephyrin (Geph-EE) (5Schrader N. Kim E.Y. Winking J. Paulukat J. Schindelin H. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18733-18741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) were transfected into L929 cells, and Moco and MPT content were determined by the nit-1 reconstitution assay (24Reiss J. Gross-Hardt S. Christensen E. Schmidt P. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 208-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). While total MPT levels in L929 cells were comparable in all samples, including non-transfected cells (supplemental Fig. S1A), clear differences were seen for the levels of reconstituted Moco (Fig. 2A). Geph2,6 exhibited maximal activity, and no activity was found for GephE. Constructs with no or modified E domains showed a somewhat lower activity than full-length gephyrin, pointing to a functional advantage of the domain fusion. In conclusion, L929 cells express functional GephE, as isolated GephG is able to restore Moco biosynthesis. Expression of transfected gephyrin variants was confirmed by Western blot using a newly generated monoclonal anti-gephyrin antibody (mAb3B11, for details see “Experimental Procedures”) and a polyclonal anti-gephyrin antibody (pAb-GepG) that recognizes GephG (Fig. 2B) (27Giesemann T. Schwarz G. Navrotzki R. Berhörster K. Rothkegel M. Schlüter K. Schrader N. Schindelin H. Mendel R.R. Kirsch J. Jockusch B.M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8330-8339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As mAb3B11 only gave signals for constructs containing the entire E domain, we conclude that it recognizes an epitope located within GephE. It is important to note that no signal for endogenous gephyrin was detected with mAb3B11, although L929 complementation confirmed GephE activity. Successful expression of Geph-GC was demonstrated with pAb-GepG antibodies. Only Geph-GCE3/4 was hard to detect, probably due to a rapid degradation as reported recently (12Lardi-Studler B. Smolinsky B. Petitjean C.M. Koenig F. Sidler C. Meier J.C. Fritschy J.M. Schwarz G. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These experiments were performed with EGFP-tagged proteins, similar to the following experiments with gephyrin splice variants in order to monitor transfection efficiency visually. To exclude any effect derived from the EGFP tag, we investigated the functionality of Geph2,6 as a representative control. Geph2,6 was expressed as non-tagged (pcDNA3-Geph2,6) or N- or C-terminally labeled EGFP fusion protein (pEGFP-Geph2,6). All constructs resulted in similar Moco synthetic activities in L929 cells (supplemental Fig. S2). Moco Activity of Gephyrin Splice Variants in L929 Cells—To determine Moco synthetic activity of gephyrin splice variants, they were first expressed in L929 fibroblasts. Upon expression of gephyrin splice variants in non-neuronal cells, different types of cytoplasmic aggregates were reported previously (20Meier J. De Chaldee M. Triller A. Vannier C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) that are believed to form imperfect scaffolds due to the lack of neuronal gephyrin-associated proteins such as collybistin (33Kins S.

Consistent with previous findings in HEK293 and COS7 cells (20Meier J. De Chaldee M. Triller A. Vannier C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) Geph2,6, Geph2,3,6, Geph2,4,6, Geph2,4′,6, and Geph2 formed round aggregates in L929 cells, the so-called “gephyrin blobs” (35Kirsch J. Kuhse J. Betz H. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1995; 6: 450-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A), while variants containing the C5 exon (Geph2,5,6 and Geph2,4,5,6) were detected mainly as cytoplasmic spike-like structures (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the only variant containing a C1 exon (Geph1,2,4′,5,6) showed a very weak diffuse signal in the cytoplasm (data not shown). Consequently, all the following functional data are derived from gephyrin variants that form the previously described intracellular aggregates (except Geph1,2,4′,5,6) in non-neuronal cells (20Meier J. De Chaldee M. Triller A. Vannier C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 35Kirsch J. Kuhse J. Betz H. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1995; 6: 450-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Consistent with the results from the domain complementation, the overall MPT content in cells expressing the different splice variants was comparable (supplemental Fig. S1B) and independent of reconstituted Moco levels (Fig. 3B). As seen for the domain reconstitutions, we found Moco synthetic activity for all gephyrin variants that contained G domains without splice modification. Variants with an additional C5 cassette (Geph2,5,6; Geph2,4,5,6; Geph1,2,4′,5,6) were completely impaired in Moco synthesis (Fig. 3B), suggesting a loss in GephG function. Although L929 cells were shown to be GephG-deficient, alteration at the E domain seems to impact the overall Moco synthetic activity of gephyrin, as deletion of the C6 cassette resulted in a significantly lower activity of Geph2. Interestingly, variants Geph2,6, Geph2,3,6, Geph2,4,6, and Geph2,4′,6 were in a similar range of activity, indicating that the insertion of cassettes C3, C4, and C4′ into the C domain did not alter the overall function of gephyrin in Moco biosynthesis. Equal expression of all eight gephyrin variants was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 3C). Band intensities were densitometrically determined and used to normalize"

Given that conversion of ceramide to non-apoptotic metabolites such as sphingomyelin and glucosylceramide protects cells from ceramide-induced apoptosis, we hypothesized that failed up-regulation of sphingomyelin generation contributes to ceramide accumulation following UVB irradiation. Because both sphingomyelin synthase and glucosylceramide synthase activities were significantly decreased in UVB-irradiated keratinocytes, we investigated whether alteration(s) in the function of ceramide transport protein (or CERT) required for sphingomyelin synthesis occur(s) in UVB-irradiated cells. Fluorescently labeled N-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-pentanoyl)-d-erythro-sphingosine (C5-DMB-ceramide) relocation to the Golgi was diminished after irradiation, consistent with decreased CERT function, whereas the CERT inhibitor N-(3-hydroxy-1-hydroxymethyl-3-phenylpropyl)dodecanamide (1R,3R isomer) (HPA-12) produced an equivalent effect. UVB irradiation also induced the rapid formation of a stable CERT homotrimer complex in keratinocytes as determined by Western immunoblot and mass spectrometry analyses, a finding replicated in HeLa, HEK293T, and HaCaT cells and in murine epidermis. Ceramide binding activity was decreased in recombinant CERT proteins containing the UVB-induced homotrimer. The middle region domain of the CERT protein was required for the homotrimer formation, whereas neither the pleckstrin homology (Golgi-binding) nor the START (ceramide-binding) domains were involved. Finally like UVB-treated keratinocytes, HPA-12 blockade of CERT function increased keratinocyte apoptosis, decreased sphingomyelin synthesis, and led to accumulation of ceramide. Thus, UVB-induced CERT homotrimer formation accounts, at least in part, for apoptosis and failed up-regulation of sphingomyelin synthesis following UVB irradiation, revealing that inactive CERT can attenuate a key metabolic protective mechanism against ceramide-induced apoptosis in keratinocytes. Increased cellular ceramide accounts in part for UVB irradiation-induced apoptosis in cultured human keratinocytes with concurrent increased glucosylceramide but not sphingomyelin generation in these cells.

UV irradiation represents a major oxidative stressor for mammalian skin. The impact of UV irradiation has been demonstrated in conjunction with the pathogenesis of myriad cutaneous diseases, including photocarcinogenesis, photoaging, and photoallergy (1Nishigori C.

Because both squamous and basal cell carcinoma cells are more resistant to apoptosis (10Raj D. Brash D.E. Grossman D. J. Investig.

Ceramide (Cer) is the constituent backbone structure for all sphingolipids and is ubiquitously distributed in all mammalian cells/tissues. Alterations of cellular Cer levels in response to specific stimuli, e.g. cytokine signaling, radiation, or oxidative stress, lead to cell cycle arrest, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis in a variety of cell types (11Mathias S.

In addition, we recently demonstrated that Cer hydrolysis, accompanied by conversion of sphingosine to sphingosine 1-phosphate, protects KC against UVB-mediated Cer-induced apoptosis. 4E. Houben, P. M. Elias, W. M. Holleran, and Y. Uchida, submitted for publication. Because Cer is synthesized de novo at/in the endoplastic reticulum (ER) and is further converted to SM and GlcCer at the level of the Golgi, intracellular transport of Cer from ER to Golgi is a primary mechanism for the generation of both GlcCer and SM, involving both ATP-dependent and -independent mechanisms (23Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 24Funakoshi T. Yasuda S. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29938-29945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recent studies reveal that the ATP-dependent Cer transport is mediated by the ceramide transport protein, CERT (25Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). CERT is a member of the family of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR)-related lipid transfer (START) proteins (26Alpy F. Tomasetto C. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2791-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal region of CERT, consisting of 230 amino acids, contains the START domain and is responsible for stereospecific Cer binding (25Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 27Kudo N. Kumagai K. Tomishige N. Yamaji T. Wakatsuki S. Nishijima M. Hanada K. Kato R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), whereas the amino-terminal region, consisting of 120 amino acids, contains the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that binds phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate at the Golgi (25Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). The middle region (MR), between the PH and START domains, has a short peptide (FFAT) motif (25Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar) that interacts with vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein (VAP) that is enriched in the ER (28Kawano M. Kumagai K. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30279-30288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that sequences within the MR domain may promote the formation of coiled-coil structures (25Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Moreover a recent study demonstrates that phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues within the MR domain down-regulates Cer transport (29Kumagai K. Kawano M. Shinkai-Ouchi F. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17758-17766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, all three domains within CERT are required for Cer transport from the ER to Golgi. We previously demonstrated that increased de novo Cer production accounts, in part, for the induction of apoptosis in cultured human keratinocytes (CHK) following UVB irradiation (16Uchida Y. Nardo A.D. Collins V. Elias P.M. Holleran W.M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 662-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, de novo synthesized Cer also is converted to GlcCer and SM, both of which are major sphingolipid species and non-apoptotic Cer metabolites in keratinocytes. Importantly although GlcCer generation increases in CHK following UVB irradiation, SM generation is not changed (16Uchida Y. Nardo A.D. Collins V. Elias P.M. Holleran W.M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 662-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated 1) whether defects in the conversion of Cer to GlcCer and/or SM occur in CHK following UVB irradiation and thereby promote apoptosis and 2) the mechanism(s) responsible for the altered metabolic conversion(s). We demonstrate here that although both SM and GlcCer synthase activities were significantly decreased in CHK following UVB irradiation GlcCer generation increased in these cells. In addition, UVB irradiation decreased Cer transport from the ER to Golgi and induced the formation of a stable CERT homotrimer associated with decreases in Cer binding. Moreover a CERT trimer was generated not only in CHK but also in HeLa, HEK293T, and HaCaT cells as well as in murine epidermis following UVB irradiation. Furthermore the oxidative stressors H2O2 and NO also induced the formation of the stable CERT homotrimer complex in cells. Finally similar to UVB irradiation, blockade of CERT function increased apoptosis in CHK. These results reveal a novel mechanism that down-regulates SM synthesis in response to oxidative stress via alterations of CERT function through the formation of an inactive, stable homotrimer complex. Materials—Cer and GlcCer were purchased from Sigma and Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA), respectively. The CERT-specific inhibitor N-(3-hydroxy-1-hydroxymethyl-3-phenylpropyl)dodecanamide (1R,3R isomer) (HPA-12 inactive), CERT expression vectors, and anti-CERT antibody were generated as described previously (30Yasuda S.

Fusenig, Heidelberg, Germany), HeLa cells, and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with plasmids containing cDNA for GFP-fused (carboxyl-terminal) CERT wild type (WT), HA (amino-terminal)-tagged-CERT WT, FLAG (amino-terminal)-tagged CERT WT, FLAG-tagged CERT MR domain, or FLAG-tagged CERT ΔMR (lacking the MR domain), which were cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (25Hanada K.

Animals—Hairless mice (Skh:hr-1), 6–8 weeks old, were purchased from Charles River USA (Hollister, CA). Mice were fed Purina mouse diet (Ralston Purina Co., St. Louis, MO) and water ad libitum. Natural sunlight was excluded, and animals were exposed only to low levels of incandescent light prior to UVB irradiation. All animal experiments were performed under an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved protocol. UVB Irradiation—UVB irradiation was performed as described previously (16Uchida Y.

Briefly cells were seeded (2–4 × 104 cells/ml) in 4-well glass chamber slides or 100-mm culture dishes and maintained to 60–80% confluence. The cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.07 mm calcium chloride followed by UVB irradiation (emission range, 280–340 nm; 305 nm maximum; FS 20/T12 bulbs, National Biological Co., Twinsburg, OH) in PBS with 0.07 mm calcium chloride. UVB exposure was measured using a Goldilux Ultraviolet radiometer (Oriel, Stratford, CT). Cells were exposed to a single UVB dose (60 mJ/cm2) in most studies unless indicated otherwise. Immediately after UVB irradiation, PBS was replaced by culture medium. Purified His-tagged recombinant CERT protein (25Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar) or murine epidermis was also irradiated with UVB as above. The dorsal skin of each mouse was irradiated with a single UVB dose equivalent to 150 mJ/cm2 (32Haratake A. Uchida Y. Schmuth M. Tanno O. Yasuda R. Epstein J.H. Elias P.M. Holleran W.M. J. Investig.

GlcCer Synthase and SM Synthase Assay—GlcCer synthase and SM synthase activities were determined as described previously (17Itoh M. Kitano T. Watanabe M. Kondo T. Yabu T. Taguchi Y. Iwai K. Tashima M. Uchiyama T. Okazaki T. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 415-423PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly cell lysates prepared in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, and proteinase inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Roche Applied Science) were used as the enzyme source. GlcCer synthase and SM synthase activities were assayed using fluorogenic Cer (C6-NBD-Cer) as the substrate. The reaction products were resolved in a solvent system that contained chloroform, methanol, and 12 mm MgCl2 in H2O (65:25:4, v/v/v). C6-NBD-GlcCer and -SM were measured by using a Typhoon 9410 Multimodal Imager (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells transfected with CERT-GFP were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v) in PBS for 10 min followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100. Permeabilized cells were then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-Golgin 97 at room temperature for 1 h and then with Alexa 680-labeled goat anti-mouse for 45 min. Control staining was performed with untransfected control cells for GFP and secondary antibody alone. Slides were examined with a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). An argon laser at 488 nm and a helium-neon laser at 543 nm were used to excite GFP (emission, 515–540 nm) and Alexa 680 (emission, 680 nm), respectively. Western Immunoblot Analysis—Western immunoblot analysis was performed using a procedure described previously (22Uchida Y. Murata S. Schmuth M. Behne M.J. Lee J.D. Ichikawa S. Elias P.M. Hirabayashi Y. Holleran W.M. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1293-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm HCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.8, and proteinase inhibitor mixture). 15–30 μg of total protein was resolved by electrophoresis on 10–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were probed with either anti-CERT antibody, monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA), monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody, or monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma), and proteins were detected using CDP-Star chemiluminescence (Invitrogen). Protein content was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Cer Transport—Cer transport was assessed using C5-DMB-Cer as reported previously (25Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M.

Cells pretreated with or without 1 μm HPA-12 for 6 h were labeled with 1 μm C5-DMB-Cer·bovine serum albumin complex (1:1) at 4 °C for 10 min and then washed with culture medium and PBS. Cells were irradiated with UVB at 4 °C in PBS followed by incubation with or without 1 μm HPA-12 at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were fixed and examined by confocal microscopy as described above. Cer Binding Assay—Binding of CERT to Cer was assessed by the method of Malakhova et al. (35Malakhova M.L. Malinina L. Pike H.M. Kanack A.T. Patel D.J. Brown R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26312-26320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with modifications. C5-DMB-Cer (1 mm) was dissolved in chloroform:methanol (9:1, v/v) in borosilicate glass tubes, dried under nitrogen to generate a Cer film immobilized on the glass, and further dried under vacuum for 1.5 h. Either UVB-treated or sham-treated purified recombinant CERT protein (50 μg) (25Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar) in 0.5 ml of Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, was added to the C5-DMB-Cer film-coated tubes and incubated for various times at 37 °C. Fluorescence intensity generated in the aqueous protein fraction was measured spectrofluorometrically (excitation at 505 nm and emission at 511 nm). Protein Identification by In-gel Digestion and Liquid Chromatography/Electrospray Ionization-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) Analysis—Fractions containing immunoprecipitated CERT from UVB- or sham-irradiated cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as above. The resolved bands, stained with Coomassie Blue, were excised and digested with trypsin overnight at 37 °C. The resulting tryptic peptides were analyzed by LC/ESI-MS/MS using an LCQ or an LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA) with a nanoelectrospray ionization source. The LC analysis was conducted using a Micro-LC system (Micro-Tech Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA) or a Thermo Surveyor HPLC system. The resulting MS/MS spectra were searched against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant protein data base using the Sequest program to identify sequences of peptides. Lipid Synthesis—To examine de novo sphingolipid synthesis following UVB irradiation, cells were cultured with [3H]serine (1.5 μCi/ml), [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (1.5 μCi/ml), or [3H]galactose (1.5 μCi/ml) for the final 6 or 8 h. Lipids were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer method (36Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar) with a modification described previously (16Uchida Y. Nardo A.D. Collins V. Elias P.M. Holleran W.M. J. Investig.

Radioisotope incorporated into each lipid fraction was measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. For in vivo studies, skin samples were obtained from euthanized animals at various time points before and 24 h after UVB exposure as described previously (37Holleran W.M. Uchida Y.

Subcutaneous fat and fascia were removed by gentle scraping, and samples were floated dermis side down on keratinocyte growth medium containing 500 μm sodium acetate (34 μCi of sodium [14C]acetate; Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. Epidermis was separated from dermis following incubation in PBS (pH 7.4, 60 °C) for 30 s. Epidermal lipids were extracted, and the separation of individual lipid species was achieved by high performance TLC (37Holleran W.M. Uchida Y. Halkier-Sorensen L. Haratake A. Hara M. Epstein J.H.

Data are reported as photostimulated luminescence/cm2 of epidermis. Apoptosis Assay—Apoptosis was assessed by determining changes in cellular nuclear chromatin as described previously (38Oberhammer F.A. Pavelka M. Sharma S. Tiefenbacher R. Purchio A.F. Bursch W.

Approximately 100 cells chosen at random on each slide were counted per replicate, and the ratio of apoptotic to non-apoptotic cells was determined. Statistical Analysis—Experiments were repeated at least three times. For each experiment, results from triplicate samples were expressed as the mean ± S.D. Significance between groups was determined with unpaired Student's t test. SM but Not GlcCer Generation Decreased in Keratinocytes following UVB Irradiation—Our prior studies demonstrated that increased Cer production accounted for, in part, the induction of apoptosis in CHK following UVB irradiation (16Uchida Y.

https://openalex.org/W2011648154,"Cultured cardiac explants produce a heterogeneous population of cells including a distinctive population of refractile cells described here as small round cardiac explant derived cells (EDCs). The aim of this study was to explore the source, morphology and cardiogenic potential of EDCs.Transgenic MLC2v-Cre/ZEG, and actin-eGFP mice were used for lineage-tracing of EDCs in vitro and in vivo. C57B16 mice were used as cell transplant recipients of EDCs from transgenic hearts, as well as for the general characterisation of EDCs. The activation of cardiac-specific markers were analysed by: immunohistochemistry with bright field and immunofluorescent microscopy, electron microscopy, PCR and RT-PCR. Functional engraftment of transplanted cells was further investigated with calcium transient studies.Production of EDCs was highly dependent on the retention of blood-derived cells or factors in the cultured explants. These cells shared some characteristics of cardiac myocytes in vitro and survived engraftment in the adult heart in vivo. However, EDCs failed to differentiate into functional cardiac myocytes in vivo as demonstrated by the absence of stimulation-evoked intracellular calcium transients following transplantation into the peri-infarct zone.This study highlights that positive identification based upon one parameter alone such as morphology or immunofluorescene is not adequate to identify the source, fate and function of adult cardiac explant derived cells."
https://openalex.org/W2128747776,"Studies in fibroblasts, neurons, and platelets have demonstrated the integration of signals from different G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in raising intracellular free Ca(2+). To study signal integration in macrophages, we screened RAW264.7 cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) for their Ca(2+) response to GPCR ligands. We found a synergistic response to complement component 5a (C5a) in combination with uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP), platelet activating factor (PAF), or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). The C5a response was Galpha(i)-dependent, whereas the UDP, PAF, and LPA responses were Galpha(q)-dependent. Synergy between C5a and UDP, mediated by the C5a and P2Y6 receptors, required dual receptor occupancy, and affected the initial release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores as well as sustained Ca(2+) levels. C5a and UDP synergized in generating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, suggesting synergy in activating phospholipase C (PLC) beta. Macrophages expressed transcripts for three PLCbeta isoforms (PLCbeta2, PLCbeta3, and PLCbeta4), but GPCR ligands selectively used these isoforms in Ca(2+) signaling. C5a predominantly used PLCbeta3, whereas UDP used PLCbeta3 but also PLCbeta4. Neither ligand required PLCbeta2. Synergy between C5a and UDP likewise depended primarily on PLCbeta3. Importantly, the Ca(2+) signaling deficiency observed in PLCbeta3-deficient BMDM was reversed by re-constitution with PLCbeta3. Neither phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase nor protein kinase C was required for synergy. In contrast to Ca(2+), PI 3-kinase activation by C5a was inhibited by UDP, as was macropinocytosis, which depends on PI 3-kinase. PLCbeta3 may thus provide a selective target for inhibiting Ca(2+) responses to mediators of inflammation, including C5a, UDP, PAF, and LPA."
https://openalex.org/W2162670995,"The M protein of Streptococcus equi subsp. equi known as fibrinogen-binding protein (FgBP) is a cell wall-associated protein with antiphagocytic activity that binds IgG. Recombinant versions of the seven equine IgG subclasses were used to investigate the subclass specificity of FgBP. FgBP bound predominantly to equine IgG4 and IgG7, with little or no binding to the other subclasses. Competitive binding experiments revealed that FgBP could inhibit the binding of staphylococcal protein A and streptococcal protein G to both IgG4 and IgG7, implicating the Fc interdomain region in binding to FgBP. To identify which of the two IgG Fc domains contributed to the interaction with FgBP, we tested two human IgG1/IgA1 domain swap mutants and found that both domains are required for full binding, with the CH3 domain playing a critical role. The binding site for FgBP was further localized using recombinant equine IgG7 antibodies with single or double point mutations to residues lying at the CH2-CH3 interface. We found that interaction of FgBP with equine IgG4 and IgG7 was able to disrupt C1q binding and antibody-mediated activation of the classical complement pathway, demonstrating an effective means by which S. equi may evade the immune response. The mode of interaction of FgBP with IgG fits a common theme for bacterial Ig-binding proteins. Remarkably, for those interactions studied in detail, it emerges that all the Ig-binding proteins target the CH2-CH3 domain interface, regardless of specificity for IgG or IgA, streptococcal or staphylococcal origin, or host species (equine or human).

Strangles is a highly contagious upper respiratory tract disease of the horse and is caused by Streptococcus equi subsp. equi, a Lancefield group C streptococcus. The disease is characterized by fever, mucopurulent nasal discharge, and the formation of abscesses in lymph nodes of the head and neck. It is one of the most frequently reported equine clinical problems worldwide and is associated with serious economic cost, because severe outbreaks may last for months or years (1Harrington D.J. Sutcliffe I.C. Chanter N. Microb. Infect. 2002; 4: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2Timoney J.F. Vet.

Complications can occur in up to 20% of strangles cases and include formation of abscesses in other body organs (“bastard strangles”) and purpura hemorrhagica, an immune complex-mediated vasculitis (3Taylor S.D.

It is 534 amino acids in length, contains two blocks of degenerate repeated sequences, and, in common with M-proteins of other Gram-positive streptococci, is predicted to possess a non-helical N terminus and extensive regions of α-helical coiled-coil structure throughout the rest of the extracellular portion of the protein (7Meehan M.

FgBP plays a significant role in the resistance of S. equi to phagocytosis and contributes substantially to its virulence (9Meehan M. Lynagh Y. Woods C. Owen P. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 3311-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of FgBP is able to bind strongly to fibrinogen, and this appears to play an important part in the antiphagocytic effect of the protein and survival of S. equi in the host (6Timoney J.F. Artiushin S.C. Boschwitz J.F. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3600-3605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Meehan M. Nowlan P. Owen P.

Lett. 2000; 190: 317-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the binding of host fibrinogen, FgBP has been demonstrated to bind to the Fc region of horse IgG, as well as IgG from several other species (human, rabbit, and cat but not mouse, rat, goat, sheep, cow, or chicken) (9Meehan M. Lynagh Y. Woods C. Owen P. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 3311-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Hence FgBP represents another example of a bacterial Ig-binding protein. A number of such proteins, produced by pathogenic staphylococcal and streptococcal strains and including the widely employed staphylococcal protein A and streptococcal protein G, have been described. The region of FgBP that binds to IgG Fc is distinct from that responsible for fibrinogen binding and involves the central part of the protein (8Meehan M. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Owen P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 206: 81-86PubMed Google Scholar, 9Meehan M. Lynagh Y. Woods C. Owen P. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 3311-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The development of specific mucosal and systemic antibody responses is considered crucial for combating infection with S. equi and for protection from future disease (2Timoney J.F. Vet. Res. 2004; 35: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Significantly, a specific IgG response has been shown to contribute to this protective humoral immunity (13Sheoran A.S. Sponseller B.T. Holmes M.A. Timoney J.F. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1997; 59: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The horse has seven IgG subclasses (14Wagner B. Greiser-Wilke I.

Immunol. 2004; 173: 3230-3242Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and to date there is no information with regard to the subclass specificity of FgBP and whether the interaction of FgBP with IgG Fc contributes to subversion of the immune response by S. equi. Here, we demonstrate that the binding of FgBP to horse IgG is highly subclass specific and that the binding site for FgBP on horse IgG Fc is located in the interdomain region and overlaps with that of protein A and G. Furthermore, binding of FgBP to horse IgG is able to disrupt antibody-mediated complement activation suggesting another mechanism by which FgBP can mediate resistance to phagocytosis and compromise the host immune response to S. equi subsp. equi. Production of FgBPs—FgBP1, a recombinant form of FgBP that lacks the wall/membrane anchor domain, was produced as described previously (7Meehan M. Nowlan P. Owen P. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 993-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).

Analysis of the Interaction of FgBP with Recombinant Equine Igs by ELISA—Interaction of FgBP1 with recombinant forms of the seven equine IgG (reqIgG) subclasses, produced and purified as described previously (16Lewis M.J. Wagner B. Woof J.M. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 818-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), was analyzed by ELISA. FgBP1 (10 μg/ml in carbonate buffer) was coated overnight at 4 °C onto 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). Control wells were coated with 10 μg/ml FgBPM-. Plates were washed in Milli-Q water and then blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat milk powder in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (PBS-T). Plates were then incubated with serial dilutions (0-20 μg/ml in PBS-T) of one of the reqIgG subclasses or recombinant equine monomeric equine IgA 4M. J. Lewis, B. Wagner, R. Irvine, and J. M. Woof, manuscript in preparation. (eqIgA) for 1 h at room temperature. Binding of reqIgs to FgBP was detected by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse λ light chain antibody (0.2 μg/ml in PBS-T) (Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, TX). Goat IgG does not bind to FgBP (9Meehan M. Lynagh Y. Woods C. Owen P. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 3311-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and so was suitable as the detection reagent in these experiments. Plates were developed as previously described (17Morton H.C. Atkin J.D. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4743-4752PubMed Google Scholar). The pH dependence of the FgBP-IgG interaction was analyzed using the same ELISA except that reqIgGs (serial dilutions of 0-10 μg/ml) were diluted in PBS-T at either pH 5.5, pH 7.4, or pH 8.5, and FgBP1 and FgBPM- were used at 5 μg/ml. Biosensor Analysis of FgBP1 Binding to reqIgG—Biosensor experiments were carried out using a BIAcore X instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Recombinant FgBP1 (20 μm in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5) was immobilized on a CM5 biosensor chip (BIAcore) using the manufacturer's instructions for amine coupling chemistry. Recombinant FgBPM- was coupled under the same conditions to the reference surface of the chip. Recombinant eqIgGs were diluted in BIAcore HBS-EP buffer (0.01 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20) across a concentration range of 0-150 μg/ml and were independently injected over the chip (60 μl and 30 μl/min). After each injection the sensor chip was regenerated with 20 μl of 10 mm glycine, pH 3, followed by a 10-μl injection of 10 mm glycine, pH 2, if required. Biosensor analysis of recombinant human IgG1 (18Pleass R.J. Dunlop J.I. Anderson C.M. Woof J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) binding to FgBP1 was also carried out as described above. BIAevaluation 3.2 software was used for data analysis. Protein G and Protein A Competition ELISAs—Plates were coated with 2.5 μg/ml of either reqIgG4 or reqIgG7 and then washed and blocked as described above. Plates were placed on ice, and 100 μl/well ice-cold HRP-conjugated protein G (0.25 μg/ml in PBS-T) (Sigma), and serial dilutions of either FgBP1 or FgBPM- (both 0-50μg/ml in PBS-T) were added simultaneously to each well. Plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature and then developed as described above. A similar ELISA was used to assess competition between HRP-conjugated protein A (Sigma) (20μg/ml) and FgBP1 or FgBPM- (serial dilutions of 0-50μg/ml) using plates coated with 5 μg/ml reqIgG4 or reqIgG7. It was necessary to use different concentrations of HRP-conjugated protein G and protein A in the assay because of the different binding affinities of the two proteins for IgG. Binding of Recombinant Human Igs to FgBP—Two previously described recombinant human IgG1/IgA1 domain-swap mutants (18Pleass R.J. Dunlop J.I. Anderson C.M. Woof J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) were assessed for binding to FgBP1. In the first mutant (γ1γ2α3), the CH3 domain of human IgG1 is replaced by the CH3 domain of human IgA1, whereas in the second (α1α2γ3), the CH3 domain of human IgA1 is replaced by the CH3 domain of human IgG1. Binding of FgBP1 to a recombinant version of the human IgG3 allotype, IGHG3*01 or IgG3m(5) (19Bruggemann M. Williams G.T. Bindon C.I. Clark M.R. Walker M.R. Jefferis R. Waldmann H. Neuberger M. J.

Med. 1987; 166: 1351-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), purified from transfectant supernatant by affinity chromatography on 3-nitro-4-hydroxy-5-iodophenylacetate-Sepharose, was also investigated. This allotype is known to lack the ability to bind protein A (20Recht B. Frangione B. Franklin E. van Loghem E. J. Immunol. 1982; 127: 917-923Google Scholar, 21van Loghem E. Frangione B. Recht B.

Binding analysis, using recombinant human IgG1 and human IgA1, produced as described previously (17Morton H.C. Atkin J.D. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4743-4752PubMed Google Scholar), as positive and negative controls, respectively, was carried out by ELISA as described above using 5 μg/ml FgBP1 to coat and serial dilutions (up to 10 μg/ml) of recombinant Igs. Site-directed Mutagenesis of eqIgG7 Heavy (H) Chain—Single or double point mutations were introduced into the CH2 or CH3 domains of the eqIgG7 H-chain using a QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions. Residues mutated in eqIgG7 corresponded to those in human IgG1 responsible for binding protein A or protein G (22Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2361-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 23Sauer-Eriksson A.E. Kleywegt G.J. Uhlen M. Jones T.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 265-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Selected residues in eqIgG7 were exchanged for the amino acid(s) present in the non-FgBP-binding eqIgG subclasses, at positions where a non-conservative amino acid alteration was found. The five mutants generated are described in Table 1. Mutant antibodies were purified and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as previously described (16Lewis M.J. Wagner B. Woof J.M. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 818-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The FgBP1 binding capacities of mutant reqIgG7s were compared with that of wild-type reqIgG7 using biosensor analysis as described above except that 100-μl injections of antibody were used.TABLE 1Names and description of reqIgG7 mutantsMutantDescriptionaNumbering corresponds to human IgG1 numbering.eqIgG subclasses carrying the same residues as those substitutedM252KMet252 in CH2 domain substituted with LysIgG5K382QLys382 in CH3 domain substituted with GlnIgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG5, IgG6HN433/434EHHis433 in CH3 domain substituted with Glu, Asn434 in CH3 domain substituted with HisGlu433 in IgG5H433RHis433 in CH3 domain substituted with ArgIgG6HY435/436TVHis435 in CH3 domain substituted with Thr, Tyr436 in CH3 domain substituted with ValThr435 in IgG6Val436 in IgG3a Numbering corresponds to human IgG1 numbering. Open table in a new tab Analysis of the Consequences of FgBP-IgG Binding on Complement Activation—FgBP-mediated inhibition of C1q binding and activation of the classic complement pathway by equine IgG was assessed by ELISA using reqIgG3, reqIgG4, and reqIgG7 (10 μg/ml), as described previously (16Lewis M.J. Wagner B. Woof J.M. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 818-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. After coating of wells with 3-nitro-4-hydroxy-5-iodophenylacetate-bovine serum albumin and subsequent incubation with recombinant Igs, plates were incubated with serial dilutions of FgBP1 or FgBPM- (0-10 μg/ml in PBS-T containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were incubated then with either human C1q protein (0.5 μg/ml, Calbiochem) or human serum. In the former case, binding of C1q to IgG was detected using sheep anti-human C1q-HRP, as previously described, whereas in the latter, activation of the classic complement pathway was detected using a 1/500 dilution of biotin-conjugated mouse anti-human C4c (Quidel, Santa Clara, CA) followed by streptavidin-HRP (1/500, Dako, Ely, Cambs, UK). C4c generation is a specific marker for activation of the classic complement pathway (24Wolbink G.J. Bollen J. Baars J.W. ten Berge R.J.M. Swaak A.J.G. Paardekooper J. Hack C.E. J. Immunol. Meth. 1993; 163: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Human C1q and human serum (as a source of complement) were used rather than their equine equivalents because of the availability of detection reagents for the human but not equine proteins. Moreover, cross-species reactivity of IgG and complement components has been well demonstrated (25Burton D.R. Woof J.M. Adv. Immunol. 1992; 51: 1-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Analysis of FgBP-IgG Binding—Binding of recombinant FgBP1 to the seven reqIgG subclasses and monomeric reqIgA was first analyzed by ELISA. FgBP1 bound strongly to reqIgG4 and reqIgG7, with little or no binding to the remaining five reqIgG subclasses or to reqIgA (Fig. 1A). Because IgG binding by the bacterial IgG-binding proteins staphylococcal protein A and streptococcal protein G is known to be pH-dependent (26Åkerström B. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we tested the effect of pH variation on the FgBP1-IgG interaction (Fig. 1, B and C). An increase in pH from 7.4 to pH 8.5 had little effect on binding, whereas a decrease in pH to 5.5 reduced binding to roughly a third of that seen at physiological pH. Hence, the pH dependence of IgG binding by FgBP is more similar to that of protein A (strongest binding at pH 8) than to that of protein G (strongest binding at pH 4-5) (26Åkerström B. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To establish the affinity of the FgBP-IgG interaction and confirm the equine IgG subclass specificity we used surface plasmon resonance measurements. These experiments gave identical results with regard to subclass specificity to those obtained by ELISA, confirming that reqIgG4 and reqIgG7 are the predominant subclasses capable of binding FgBP1 (Fig. 2). These subclasses share similar affinity in the micromolar range (Ka values of 6.96 × 106 m-1 for reqIgG7 and 6.79 × 106 m-1 for reqIgG4). Hence, binding affinity is much lower than that of protein G for IgG (26Åkerström B. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and closer to that of fragment B of protein A (27Lancet D. Isenman D. Sjödahl J. Sjöquist J. Pecht I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 85: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Localization of the FgBP Binding Site on Equine IgG—Protein A and protein G are known to bind in the interdomain region of IgG Fc (22Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2361-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 23Sauer-Eriksson A.E. Kleywegt G.J. Uhlen M. Jones T.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 265-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and have both been shown to interact with reqIgG4 and reqIgG7, although the binding to protein A is relatively weak (16Lewis M.J. Wagner B. Woof J.M. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 818-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used a competition ELISA to see if FgBP could inhibit binding of proteins A and G to reqIgG4 and reqIgG7. We found that FgBP1, but not the non-IgG-binding control protein FgBPM-, was able to compete with both protein A and protein G for binding to reqIgG4 and reqIgG7 (Fig. 3). This inhibition was concentration-dependent, and binding of both protein A and protein G was negligible at the maximum concentration of FgBP1 (50 μg/ml). These findings suggest that the FgBP binding site(s) on reqIgG4 and reqIgG7 overlap with those of protein A and protein G in the Fc interdomain region. To determine whether one or both of the IgG Fc domains contribute to FgBP binding, we utilized recombinant human IgG1 and two human IgG1/IgA1 domain-swap mutants. Using biosensor analysis (data not shown), we found that human IgG1 interacted with FgBP1 with an affinity (Ka of 5.71 × 106 m-1) only slightly lower than that of reqIgG4 and reqIgG7. Like eqIgA, human IgA1 was found not to bind FgBP1 (Fig. 4). A domain-swap mutant lacking the CH2 domain but retaining the CH3 domain of IgG1 (α1α2γ3) was able to bind to FgBP1, but at a much reduced level compared with that of wild-type human IgG1 (Fig. 4). However, FgBP1 binding was completely absent for a mutant retaining the CH2 domain but lacking the CH3 domain of IgG1 (γ1γ2α3) (Fig. 4). Hence, both Fc domains are required for maximal binding, but the CH3 domain appears to be the most critical. In addition, we included in this analysis a recombinant human IgG3 antibody of the IGHG3*01 allotype. IgG3 allotypes capable of binding protein A possess a His residue at position 435 within the interaction site for protein A. However, the IGHG3*01 allotype carries an Arg at this critical CH3 domain residue and is unable to bind protein A (20Recht B. Frangione B. Franklin E. van Loghem E. J. Immunol. 1982; 127: 917-923Google Scholar, 21van Loghem E. Frangione B. Recht B. Franklin E.C. Scand. J. Immunol. 1982; 15: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We found that the IGHG3*01 allotype did not bind FgBP1, indicating that residue 435 is critical also for interaction with FgBP (Fig. 4). To further localize the FgBP binding site on equine IgG, we generated five IgG7 mutants with single or double point mutations in the regions corresponding to the protein A/protein G binding sites (Table 1). Analysis of the IgG7 mutants by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting revealed that all the mutant reqIgG7s assembled like wild-type reqIgG7 and retained the anticipated reactivity with antigen and both polyclonal and monoclonal anti-equine IgGb (i.e. anti-eqIgG4 and -eqIgG7) reagents (Fig. 5). These test outcomes and the fact that the substitutions were based on residues present in other equine IgG isotypes suggest that the likelihood of unintended conformational disruption in the mutants is extremely low, allowing us to draw meaningful conclusions on the relative contributions of the mutated residues to FgBP binding. Binding of the mutant reqIgG7s to FgBP1 was analyzed using surface plasmon resonance experiments (Fig. 6). Mutants M252K and K382Q both showed decreased FgBP1 binding compared with wild-type reqIgG7. However, the 45-fold decrease in FgBP1 binding by M252K (Ka of 1.53 × 105 m-1) was more dramatic than the 2.4-fold decrease shown by K382Q (Ka of 2.91 × 106 m-1). Mutant H433R showed a small (1.7-fold, Ka of 4 × 106 m-1) reduction in FgBP1 binding capacity compared with wild-type reqIgG7. However, the double point mutants HN433/434EH and HY435/436TV showed drastically impaired abilities to bind FgBP1, retaining <5% of the binding capacity of wild-type reqIgG7. The FgBP1 binding affinities and interdomain site sequence alignment of the tested IgGs are summarized in Fig. 7. Taken together these results suggest that the binding site on IgG for FgBP encompasses some of the same interdomain residues as those involved in interaction with protein A and protein G. Residues in the Leu251-Ser254 and the Leu432-Tyr436 loops are particularly implicated. Comparison of the binding affinities of mutants H433R and HN433/434EH suggests that either His433 is not critical for FgBP binding, or that alteration of this residue to a positively charged amino acid such as arginine (as in H433R) can be tolerated without significant impact on the affinity of the interaction. In contrast, residues His435 and/or Tyr436 appear to be critical for the interaction, because in both instances where these residues are substituted (with Arg435 and Phe436 in human IgG3 allotype IGHG3*01 and with Thr435 and Val436 in reqIgG7 mutant HY435/436TV) binding to FgBP1 is ablated. Overall, we can conclude that the binding site for FgBP on reqIgG Fc appears to center on the interdomain region, utilizing residues common to both the protein A and protein G binding sites.FIGURE 6Biosensor analysis of the binding of FgBP1 to reqIgG7 mutants. Injections of 100 μl (30 μl/min) of reqIgG7s at 0, 5, 10, 25, 35, 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150μg/ml are shown. A, wild-type reqIgG7; B, M252K; C, K382Q; D, H433R; E, HN433/434EH; F, HY435/436TV.

Wagner B. Woof J.M. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 818-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To gain an insight into the physiological consequences of FgBP binding to eqIgG4 and eqIgG7, we investigated whether FgBP1 could inhibit their ability to bind C1q and activate the classical complement pathway. We found that FgBP1 was able to disrupt C1q binding and complement activation by reqIgG4 and reqIgG7 (Fig. 8). In contrast, FgBP1 was unable to disrupt C1q binding and complement activation by reqIgG3, which we have shown binds poorly or not at all to FgBP1 (Fig. 8). The control protein, FgBPM-, had no effect on C1q binding or complement activation. With the highest concentration of FgBP1 used (10 μg/ml), C1q binding and complement activation by reqIgG4 and reqIgG7 decreased to 50 and 40%, respectively, of that seen in the absence of FgBP1. This partial rather than complete inhibition of antibody-mediated complement activation may be a consequence of using soluble rather than cell-bound FgBP (see “Discussion” below). Ig-binding proteins have been identified in a range of bacteria, and their diversity in Ig binding characteristics in terms of Ig isotype, subclass, and species has long been recognized. The horse has an unusually large number of IgG subclasses, which vary in their structural and functional attributes (14Wa"

Hypertonic stress promotes nuclear translocation and activates its enhancer activity. In contrast, hypotonicity induces OREBP/TonEBP nuclear export (1Ko B.C. Turck C.W. Lee K.W. Yang Y. Chung S.S.

Furthermore, a number of kinases have been implicated in this process. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms that control the subcellular localization and activity of OREBP/TonEBP remain largely unknown. Previously, we have identified and characterized three domains of OREBP/TonEBP that regulate its subcellular localization (26Tong E.H. Guo J.J. Huang A.L. Liu H. Hu C.D. Chung S.S. Ko B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23870-23879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These domains include a nuclear localization signal (NLS), a canonical nuclear export sequence (NES), and a novel auxiliary export domain (AED). The NES, in conjunction NLS, regulates nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of OREBP/TonEBP under isotonic conditions, whereas the AED is indispensable for its nuclear export under both isotonic and hypotonic conditions. Here we identify the mechanism underlying the AED-mediated nuclear export of OREBP/TonEBP. We show that Ser-155 in the AED, together with Ser-158, plays a critical role in regulating OREBP/TonEBP nuclear export. Ser-155 and Ser-158 are both phosphorylated in response to hypotonicity. Our data further reveal that phosphorylation proceeds in a hierarchical manner with Ser-155 phosphorylation priming the phosphorylation of Ser-158. Furthermore, we show that casein kinase 1 (CK1) directs the phosphorylation of Ser-158. Our findings thus provide an important insight into the mechanism of the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of OREBP/TonEBP in response to extracellular tonicity. Plasmid Constructs and Chemicals—The original OREBP cDNA clone KIAA0827 was a gift from Dr. Takahiro Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Japan). FLAG-OREBP-(1-581)-Δ1-131 was constructed as described previously (26Tong E.H. Guo J.J. Huang A.L. Liu H. Hu C.D. Chung S.S. Ko B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23870-23879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). GST-OREBP-(146-167) was derived by in-frame insertion of double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to amino acid residues 146-167 of OREBP between the BamHI and XhoI restriction sites of pGEX4T-1 (GE Healthcare). Point mutants of FLAG-OREBP-(1-581)-Δ1-131 and GST-OREBP-(146-167) were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the corresponding parental constructs as templates. All the constructs were verified by sequencing. CKI-7 was obtained from United States Biological. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine (300 mosmol/kg H2O). For subcellular localization studies, cells grown in 6-well plates to 50% confluence were transfected with 0.6 μg of the plasmids expressing the proteins using GeneJuice (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were incubated for 16-24 h in complete growth medium before switching to medium with different osmolality. Hypotonic (260 mosmol/kg H2O), isotonic (300 mosmol/kg H2O), or hypertonic (500 mosmol/kg H2O) medium was prepared by supplementing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine and different amounts of NaCl to NaCl-deficient minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) to the desired osmolality. Medium osmolality was measured by the Vapro® vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor). Immunoaffinity Purification, Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT), Mass Spectrometry, and Data Base Searching—20 × 106 HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-OREBP-(1-581)-Δ1-131. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were treated with hypotonic medium (260 mosmol/kg H2O) for 90 min and lysed with SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol). Cell lysates were diluted 20-fold by dilution buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors) and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography using anti-FLAG affinity resin (Sigma). The purified protein was precipitated by 20% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitate was washed twice with acetone, dried, and resuspended in 8 m urea and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The solubilized protein was reduced by the addition of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine to 5 mm, followed by the carboxyamidomethylation of cysteines using 10 mm iodoacetamide. The concentration of urea was then diluted 2-fold (to 4 m) by the addition of an equal volume of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Sequencing grade endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche Diagnostics) and modified trypsin (Promega) was added at ∼1:50 enzyme to substrate ratio (w/w) and incubated at 37 °C for 4 and 12-16 h, respectively. The resulting peptides were extracted with 5% formic acid and re-dissolved into buffer A (5% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) prior to the liquid chromatography-MS/MS analysis. Peptide mixtures were enriched by the TiO2 method (27Cantin G.T. Shock T.R. Park S.K. Madhani H.D. Yates III, J.R. Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 4666-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and pressure-loaded onto a biphasal column, which consists of a strong cation exchange material back-to-back with reversed phase material inside fused silica capillaries (collectively known as multidimensional protein identification technology, Mud-PIT) (28Washburn M.P.

Data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis was performed in an LTQ mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher, San Jose, CA). One full MS spectrum was acquired followed by five MS/MS events, sequentially generated on the first to the fifth most intense ions selected from the full MS spectrum. MS scan functions and high pressure liquid chromatography solvent gradients were controlled by the Xcalibur data system (ThermoFisher). Tandem mass spectra were searched against the NCBI human data base on December 12, 2006, with the sequence of OREBP/TonEBP added, using the SEQUEST (29Eng J. McCormack A. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5311) Google Scholar) algorithm, where phosphorylation at serine, threonine, and tyrosine were differentially considered. The validity of peptide/spectrum matches was assessed using the SEQUEST-defined parameters, cross-correlation score (XCorr), and normalized difference in cross-correlation scores (DeltaCn). Spectra/peptide matches were only retained if they had a DeltaCn of at least 0.08 and minimum XCorr of 1.8 for +1, 2.5 for +2, and 3.5 for +3 spectra. DTASelect (31Tabb D.L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar) with phosphorylated modification as described (29Eng J. McCormack A. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5311) Google Scholar) was used to select and sort peptide/spectrum matches passing this criteria set. Proteins were considered detected if they were identified by at least three spectra passing all of the selection criteria or with at least 10% sequence coverage. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 4% w/v paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C. The cells were permeabilized with absolute methanol for 2 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies against FLAG (Sigma) were used. The fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) was used as secondary antibodies. To visualize the nuclei, the cells were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma). The fluorescence images were viewed with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M fluorescence microscope and analyzed with AxioVision software. Quantification of fluorescence signal in different subcellular compartment was conducted as we have described (26Tong E.H. Guo J.J. Huang A.L. Liu H. Hu C.D. Chung S.S. Ko B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23870-23879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Live Cell Microscopy and Time-lapse Imaging—HeLa cells transiently expressed GFP reporter fusion proteins were viewed with an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200 M fluorescence microscope. A heated chamber perfused with CO2 was used to incubate the cells at 37 °C. After 30 min, original growth medium was removed and replaced with pre-warmed hypotonic growth medium. Time-lapse monitoring was initiated within 5 min. Images were taken at 30-min intervals and were analyzed using AxioVision software. Preparation of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Fractions—Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were purified as described (8Ko B.C. Ruepp B. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Chung S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16431-16437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106 subconfluent HeLa cells were treated with hypotonic (260 mosmol/kgH2O), isotonic (300 mosmol/kg H2O), or hypertonic (500 mosmol/kg H2O) growth medium for the indicated time and then scraped into hypotonic, isotonic, or hypertonic PBS, respectively. Cells were centrifuged for 1 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of cold buffer B (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF). Cells were disrupted using a Dounce homogenizer and were centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was washed with buffer B, resuspended in 100 μl of cold buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF), and incubated for 15 min on ice. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 13,000 rpm, at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected as the nuclear extract. The extract was diluted with 200 μl of modified buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.05 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 20% glycerol). The quality of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions preparations was verified by analysis of α-tubulin (cytoplasmic) and TFIIB (nucleus), respectively. Expression of GST-tagged Fusion Proteins in Escherichia coli—The GST-OREBP-(146-167) and its point mutants were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) bacteria (Invitrogen) to produce GST fusion proteins. Expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyroanoside for 2 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were harvested, lysed in lysis buffer (PBS with 5% glycerol, 100 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.2 units/ml DNase I, and Complete protease inhibitors), and centrifuged to remove debris. GST fusion proteins were purified from lysates with glutathione-Sepharose 4 Beads (GE Healthcare). The size and purity of the protein preparations were verified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assay—Whole cell, nuclear, or cytoplasm extracts (15 μg) obtained from HeLa cells, or recombinant CK1α1 (Invitrogen), were incubated with GST proteins (10 μg) in a kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES KOH, pH 7.5, 100 μm ATP, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 30 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm DTT, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Substrate phosphorylation was analyzed by autoradiography. For experiments involving CKI-7, 150 μm CKI-7 (United States Biological) or the same volume of ethanol (solvent) was added to the reaction mixture 10 min before the addition of ATP and [γ-32P]ATP. RNA Interference-mediated Knockdown of CK1s—HeLa cells were transfected with 100 nm CK1 isoform-specific (CK1α1L, CK1α1, CK1-γ3, CK1-ϵ, and CK1-δ) or nontargeting control siRNAs (Qiagen) by DharmaFECT1 (Dharmacon). After 48 h, cells were transfected with FLAG-OREBP-(1-581)-Δ1-131. After another 24 h, cells were subjected to total RNA isolation or immunofluorescence microscopy. Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA synthesis and reverse transcription-PCR were carried out using SuperScript™ III Platinum CellsDirect two-step quantitative reverse transcription-PCR kit with SYBR® Green (Invitrogen). Each RNA sample was amplified in triplicate for the genes of interest and β-actin for normalization on a Mx3000P® quantitative PCR system. The primers for detecting CK1α1L (CSNK1A1L), CK1α1 (CSNK1A1), CK1-γ3, CK1-ϵ, and CK1-δ were obtained from Qiagen. Ser-155 Located in the AED of OREBP/TonEBP Plays a Critical Role in Hypotonicity-induced Nuclear Export—Our earlier study showed that the transactivation domain of OREBP/TonEBP is not required for nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, whereas the NES (amino acids 5-15) and AED (amino acids 132-156) are involved in this process (Fig. 1A). The NES is mainly responsible for the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of OREBP/TonEBP under isotonic conditions, and the AED plays an indispensable role in the nuclear export of the transcription factor under both isotonic and hypotonic conditions (26Tong E.H. Guo J.J. Huang A.L. Liu H. Hu C.D. Chung S.S. Ko B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23870-23879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To identify the critical amino acid residues responsible for hypotonicity-induced nuclear export in this domain, we carried out alanine scanning mutagenesis on selected residues in the AED, using the FLAG-OREBP-(1-581)-Δ1-131 plasmid as template. This plasmid contains a mutant OREBP/TonEBP protein devoid of NES that is preferentially localized to the nucleus under isotonic conditions but remains responsive for hypotonicity-induced nuclear export signaling (26Tong E.H. Guo J.J. Huang A.L. Liu H. Hu C.D. Chung S.S. Ko B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23870-23879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). All the amino acid residues in the AED that were potential candidates for post-translational modifications, including serine (Ser-134, Ser-145, and Ser-155), threonine (Thr-135 and Thr-140), tyrosine (Tyr-143), lysine (Lys-137), and arginine (Arg-138 and Arg-156), were evaluated (Fig. 1A). The FLAG-tagged OREBP mutant constructs were transiently expressed in HeLa cells, and their subcellular localization in response to hypotonic conditions was determined. In agreement with our previous findings (26Tong E.H. Guo J.J. Huang A.L. Liu H. Hu C.D. Chung S.S. Ko B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23870-23879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), indirect immunofluorescence analysis using anti-FLAG antibodies revealed that wild-type FLAG-OREBP-(1-581)-Δ1-131 resided in the nucleus under isotonic conditions and was localized to the cytoplasm in response to hypotonic challenge (Fig. 1B). All the alanine mutants remained responsive to hypotonic challenge except for the alanine substitution at Ser-155 (S155A) (Fig. 1B), indicating that this amino acid plays an important role in nuclear exclusion of OREBP/TonEBP. Western blotting analysis showed that all the protein mutants were correctly expressed (Fig. 1C). In addition, all the mutants were expressed at levels similar to the WT protein, suggesting that alanine substitution did not result in protein misfolding, which may have targeted the protein for proteasome degradation. Mapping the AED Phosphorylation Sites—The above data suggested that the hypotonicity-induced nuclear export of OREBP/TonEBP may be associated with Ser-155 phosphorylation. To identify the potential phosphorylated residue(s), recombinant OREBP/TonEBP was purified from HeLa cells using affinity chromatography using the anti-FLAG antibody and was analyzed by mass spectrometry. Purified protein was doubly digested with trypsin and Lys-C, and the resultant peptides were subjected to MudPIT (28Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates III, J.R. Nat.

Fig. 2 shows a representative MS/MS spectrum corresponding to the fragment ions derived from a peptide parent ion dually phosphorylated at Ser-155 and Ser-158. The MS/MS spectrum was consistent with serine sites modified by its dominated y-ions series. The observed y5-(pSCQDG) ion (m/z 646.3) and y8-(pSRMp-SCQDG) (m/z 1100.4) and their corresponding neutral loss of water peaks y5-H2O and y8-H2O confirmed the location of phosphorylated modified serine residues. The identity of the modified peptide was subsequently validated by performing a SEQUEST (29Eng J. McCormack A. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5311) Google Scholar) and DTASelect (31Tabb D.L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar) search with a predefined differential mass shift of +80 for serine. This approach led to the unambiguous identification of the FLAG-tagged OREBP with a sequence coverage of 56% and demonstrated phosphorylation on Ser-155 and Ser-158. The identified phosphorylated sites were further validated using the DeBunker algorithm (33Lu B. Ruse C. Xu T. Park S.K. Yates III, J. Anal.

Ser-155 Phosphorylation “Primes” Ser-158 Phosphorylation—We next sought to determine whether Ser-155 and Ser-158 could be phosphorylated in vitro. Protein substrates were prepared by bacterial expression of cDNA constructs encoding amino acid residues 146-167 of OREBP, which encompasses Ser-155 and Ser-158 (there is no other serine or threonine residue in this fragment), in-frame with the GST tag epitope (GST-OREBP-(146-167)). In vitro kinase assays were carried out by incubating this substrate, in the p"

Biochemical and genetic data support the notion that IDE may play a role in late onset Alzheimer disease (AD), and recent studies suggest an association between AD and diabetes mellitus type 2. Here we show that a natively folded recombinant IDE was capable of forming a stable complex with Aβ that resisted dissociation after treatment with strong denaturants. This interaction was also observed with rat brain IDE and detected in an SDS-soluble fraction from AD cortical tissue. Aβ sequence 17–27, known to be crucial in amyloid assembly, was sufficient to form a stable complex with IDE. Monomeric as opposed to aggregated Aβ was competent to associate irreversibly with IDE following a very slow kinetics (t½ ∼ 45 min). Partial denaturation of IDE as well as preincubation with a 10-fold molar excess of insulin prevented complex formation, suggesting that the irreversible interaction of Aβ takes place with at least part of the substrate binding site of the protease. Limited proteolysis showed that Aβ remained bound to a ∼25-kDa N-terminal fragment of IDE in an SDS-resistant manner. Mass spectrometry after in gel digestion of the IDE ·Aβ complex showed that peptides derived from the region that includes the catalytic site of IDE were recovered with Aβ. Taken together, these results are suggestive of an unprecedented mechanism of conformation-dependent substrate binding that may perturb Aβ clearance, insulin turnover, and promote AD pathogenesis.

Llovera R. Ibendhal S. Castanño E.M. Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 1387-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Aβ accumulation has been attributed to several convergent mechanisms. These include a high rate of Aβ production, a fast kinetic of aggregation, and a defective clearance in the brain as the result of impaired transport, protein-protein interactions, or specific protease deficiencies (reviewed in Ref. 1Morelli L. Llovera R. Ibendhal S. Castanño E.M. Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 1387-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The first two mechanisms may account for the accelerated Aβ deposition in rare hereditary disorders caused by mutations in the amyloid β precursor protein (APP) or presenilin genes, whereas the latter may be relevant in the complex pathogenesis of the more frequent sporadic AD. It is now accepted that self-assembly of Aβ follows a nucleation kinetic (2Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). In this process, nucleation takes place above the critical concentration of the peptide, and, therefore, the transient and steady levels of monomeric Aβ in the brain and the mechanisms that regulate them acquire a major importance. Although the input of Aβ depends largely on the rate of proteolytic release from APP, its clearance depends on diffusion, transport, and degradation. Neprilysin, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), and endothelin-converting enzyme are thought to be Aβ proteases of major physiological relevance, as shown by gene knock-out and overexpression animal models (3Iwata N.

IDE is a highly conserved and ubiquitous Zn2+ metalloendopeptidase that belongs to the M16 family defined by an “inverted” canonical sequence in the active site (HXXEH instead of HEXXH), as compared with other members of the clan (8Roth R Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Elsevier Academic Press, New York2004: 868-876Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Although the precise physiological role of IDE is unknown, its deficiency after gene targeting in mice leads to a biochemical phenotype that includes hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, elevated levels of soluble Aβ in the brain, and a substantial increase in the ∼50-residue C-terminal intracellular domain of APP (4Farris W.

These findings, together with preceding work on cell cultures, support that IDE participates in the degradation of these peptides in vivo, regulating their physiological levels (9Qiu W.Q. Walsh D.M.

In addition, IDE has been shown to degrade a number of peptides of diverse sequence and functions, including several with the potential to form amyloid in vivo or in vitro. Apart from insulin, IDE can degrade glucagon, atrial natriuretic peptide, calcitonin, amylin, Aβ, including all its genetic variants, amyloid Bri, and amyloid Dan (reviewed in Refs. 11Kurochkin I.V.

It has been long proposed that IDE specificity is dictated in part by substrate backbone conformation, a prediction that has been confirmed by recent crystallographic data (11Kurochkin I.V.

A growing number of studies suggest a possible genetic association of IDE polymorphisms with sporadic late-onset AD (reviewed in Ref. 15Vepsalainen S. Parkinson M. Helisalmi S. Mannermaa A.

In addition, recent work supports the association between diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperinsulinemia, and the risk for developing AD, placing IDE as a protein that may link several biochemical features of these diseases (reviewed in Refs. 16Qiu W.Q.

It has been proposed that part of the loss of IDE activity may be accounted for by lower IDE mRNA levels or post-translational modifications such as oxidative damage (21Shinall H. Song E.S.

In this study we report the unexpected finding that Aβ forms a highly stable complex that comprises part of the active site of IDE, suggesting a novel interaction between IDE and Aβ with potential implications in AD pathogenesis. Peptides and Antibodies—Aβ1–28, bovine insulin, bovine ubiquitin, and human growth hormone releasing factor 1–40 (GRF) were from Sigma; Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 were from Bachem; Aβ17–40, AβCys16–28, and AβCys17–27 were synthesized at the W. M. Keck facility at Yale University. [125I]Insulin (specific activity, 270 μCi/μg) was a gift of Edgardo Poskus, University of Buenos Aires. Synthetic Aβ1–40E22Q was kindly provided by Dr. Jorge Ghiso (New York University). Human cystatin C (CysC) was from Merck Biosciences. Antibodies against Aβ 6E10 (positions 4–13) and 4G8 (positions 17–24) were from Signet Labs, Dedham, MA. Rabbit polyclonal anti-ubiquitin was from Sigma. The rabbit antisera S40 and S42, specific for Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively, were gifts of Dr. Mikio Shoji (Okayama University, Japan). Rabbit antiserum BC2 was generated against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein comprising residues 97–273 of rat IDE, as previously described (12Morelli L. Llovera R. Gonzalez S.A.

Monoclonal antibody 3A2 against rat IDE was produced and purified as reported previously (20Morelli L. Llovera R.E. Mathov I. Lue L. Frangione B. Ghiso J. Castanño E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 56004-56013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-CysC was raised with purified human CysC from urine following standard protocols and characterized by ELISA and Western blot. Human endogenous Aβ1–40 with the E22Q substitution was purified and characterized from the leptomeninges of a case of hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis, Dutch type (HCHWA-D), as previously reported (23Castanño E.M.

Fluorescein Labeling of Aβ—AβCys16–28 and AβCys17–27 (1.5 mg/ml) were incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine HCl in 50 mm phosphate, pH 7, for 1 h at room temperature followed by the addition of 60 μl of 2.5 mg of fluoresceinmaleimide (Molecular Probes) in DMSO. The reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C in the dark and stopped by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 50 mm. Peptides were purified by reversed-phase chromatography with a C18 column (Beckman Ultrasphere ODS), and the eluate was monitored at 215 nm. HPLC peaks were analyzed by mass spectrometry as described below to assess the incorporation of fluorescein. The peaks containing single peptides with m/z of 1983.3 and 1726.5, corresponding to fluorescein-labeled AβCys16–28 and AβCys17–27 (FAβs) at a 1:1 stoichiometry, respectively, were identified. The concentrations of these derivatives were determined by absorbance at 492 nm in 0.1 m Tris HCl, pH 9 (extinction coefficient 83,000 cm–1 m–1) with a Beckman-Coulter spectrophotometer and stored in the HPLC elution solvent at –80 °C for binding experiments. Recombinant IDE Purification—Recombinant rat IDE 42–1019 (rIDE) was subcloned from pECE-IDE into pET-30a(+) (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified using a Hi-Trap Ni2+ chelating column as described (20Morelli L.

Further purification was obtained by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). On-line laser light scattering data were collected with a PD2010 detector. The relation between a 90° static light scattering signal and UV absorbance or refractive index signal was used to calculate molecular mass and hydrodynamic diameter with the Discovery 32 software (Precision Detectors, Bellingham, MA). The purity, folding parameters, and activity of rIDE are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. Protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm (extinction coefficient, 115,810 cm–1 m–1) and by a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) and expressed as monomeric rIDE. Spectroscopic Studies—CD measurements were carried out on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. Far-UV spectra were collected using a Peltier temperature-controlled sample holder at 25 °C in a 0.2-cm path length cell, with rIDE concentration of 0.8 μm in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on an Aminco-Bowman spectrofluorometer with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm in the same buffer and rIDE concentration as above. Denaturation of rIDE induced by urea was assessed by the loss of molar ellipticity at 222 nm and changes in the center of spectral mass of Trp fluorescence at the indicated urea concentrations in the same buffer as above. rIDE ·Aβ Complex Formation and Treatments—Peptides and rIDE were incubated at the indicated concentrations and molar ratios in 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.2, for 3 h at 37°C with constant agitation at 350 rpm in a Thermomixer Comfort block (Eppendorf). The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 40% glycerol, 4% SDS containing 0.1 m dithiothreitol (sample buffer, SB). To assess the effect of urea and formic acid, the reaction volume was dried under vacuum followed by the addition of 8 m urea in 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.2, or 70% formic acid, respectively and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Acid-treated samples were dried under a stream of N2 before the addition of electrophoresis SB. For guanidine-HCl treatment, to a 20-μl reaction of rIDE and Aβ1–28, 180 μl of 7.5 m guanidine in HCl (10 mm) or 180 μl of milli-Q water were added, and the samples were incubated for 1 additional hour at 37 °C. After bringing the final volume to 1.8 ml with water, proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, centrifuged at 15,000 g at 4 °C for 30 min, and carefully washed with ice-chilled acetone to remove the excess of guanidine. This last step was repeated three times. The pellet was dried under vacuum, and then resuspended with SB for SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Aβ1–40E22Q was incubated at 250 μm in PBS for 3 weeks or applied freshly after disaggregation (see below) for incubation with rIDE. For the time-course experiments, Aβ1–28 was pretreated with 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) as described (24Wood S.J. Maleeff B. Hart T. Wetzel R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and incubated at 100:1 molar ratio (Aβ:IDE) in 20 μl of 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, in the presence or absence of 5 mm EDTA for the indicated times at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by boiling in 20 μl of SB, and samples were stored at –80 °C until the electrophoresis was performed. Data from two experiments in duplicate were fit to a single exponential equation and analyzed with GraphPad Prism 4 software. Competition experiments were carried out by incubating increasing concentrations of insulin or GRF with 2.5 μm FAβ16–28 and 50 nm rIDE for the indicated periods of time at 37 °C in 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 5 mm EDTA. Dynamic Light Scattering and Aggregation Assay—Aβ1–28 was pre-treated with HFIP to disaggregate oligomers, dried under nitrogen, dissolved to a final concentration of 100 μm in 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.2, and filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane. This sample was incubated al 37 °C for up to 72 h, and particle size was assessed at the indicated times by dynamic light scattering using the excitation laser at 633 nm and a detector angle: of 173° with a Zetasizer Nano-S (Malvern Instruments). After the indicated incubation times, data were expressed as particle relative abundance versus particle hydrodynamic diameter. To study the aggregation kinetic of FAβCys16–28, the peptide stock was lyophilized, dissolved at the indicated concentrations in 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.2, and layered upon an equal volume of 20% sucrose in the same buffer. After incubation for the indicated times at 37 °C with continuous agitation at 350 rpm, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Aliquots from the supernatant were carefully removed and dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9, and absorbance was measured at 492 nm. Data from two independent experiments in duplicate were expressed as percentage of soluble peptide, taking the dead time of the experiment as 100%. IDE ·AβSCx Formation with Endogenous IDE—Brains were obtained from adult Sprague-Dawley rats following protocols approved by the Fundación Instituto Leloir Ethical Committee. Tissue was homogenized in Tris-HCl-buffered saline, pH 8 (TBS), containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. One milligram of proteins from the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody 3A2 coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. After washing with 0.4 m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, the pellets were incubated with 2 μg of Aβ1–40 in 40 μl of 0.1 m phosphate, pH 8, for 3 h at 37°Cand centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min, and the beads were boiled in 30 μl of SB. Proteins were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and IDE ·AβSCx detected by Western blot with antibody S40 as described below. Negative controls included the immunoprecipitation with an unrelated mouse IgG, 3A2-Sepharose beads with buffer alone, and rat brain proteins with protein G alone. IDE ·AβSCx Detection in Rat Brain—The pellet obtained from the rat brain homogenate as described above was homogenized in 10 volumes of TBS containing protease inhibitors, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. One milligram of proteins from the supernatant was immunoprecipitated as indicated before with 3A2 or unrelated mouse IgG in the same buffer without SDS. After washing, proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot with anti-Aβ S40 and S42. IDE ·AβSCx Detection in AD Brain—Brain samples of definite AD cases were obtained from participants enrolled in the Brain Donation Program of Sun Health Research Institute (Sun City, AZ). Approximately 300 mg of frontal cortex from each case was dissected on ice, pooled (n = 5), homogenized, and centrifuged as described above. The pellet was homogenized in TBS containing protease inhibitors and 2% SDS and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. One milligram of proteins from the water and SDS-soluble fractions were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-IDE 3A2 coupled to Sepharose in TBS-0.2% SDS. Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot using anti-Aβ S42, S40, and BC2 (see below). For urea treatment, the beads pellet was resuspended in 2 vol. of SB containing 9 m urea. Negative controls included immunoprecipitation of brain proteins with an unrelated mouse IgG coupled to Sepharose and 3A2 beads with buffer alone. High Performance Liquid Chromatography—The separation of rIDE ·Aβ complexes by HPLC was performed with a C4 Brownlee BU-300 (30 × 2.1 mm) column using a linear gradient from 0 to 100% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 0.2 ml/min monitored at 214 nm. The peaks were analyzed by ELISA as described below. For the purification of FAβ peptides, a C18 Beckman Ultrasphere (250 × 4.6 mm) was used, with a linear gradient from 0 to 100% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 1 ml/min. Peaks were detected at 214 nm, collected, and concentrated with a SpeedVac, and peptides were quantitated as described above and analyzed by mass spectrometry (see below). After in gel endoproteinase LysC (endo-LysC) digestion of rIDE ·Aβ complex, peptides were separated using a linear gradient from 0 to 100% ACN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 75 min. Enzyme-linked Immunoadsorbent Assay—Aliquots of 20 μl from all the peaks obtained from HPLC were mixed with 80 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% ACN, placed on polystyrene microtiter plates (Nunc), and incubated at 37 °C until evaporation (typically overnight). After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 h at 37°C, wells were incubated with antibodies 6E10, 4G8, S40, or BC2 overnight at 4 °C in 0.3% bovine serum albumin in PBS followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at room temperature in the same buffer. Reactivity was developed with ortho-phenylenediamine and H2O2 for 10 min, stopped with 1 n SO4H2, and the optical density was measured at 490 nm with a microtiter plate reader 550 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). After subtraction of background levels (wells without peptide), optical density values were plotted and analyzed with GraphPad Prism version 4. To better reflect the total immunoreactive proteins obtained from each HPLC peak, results were expressed as the product of optical density at 490 nm and peak volume, in arbitrary units. SDS-PAGE, Western Blot, and Fluorescence Detection—Proteins were run on 7.5 or 12.5% Tris-Tricine gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. In some experiments, gels were cut horizontally at the level of the 67-kDa molecular mass marker. The lower half was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the upper half was transferred at 400 mA for 3 h to detect rIDE and rIDE ·Aβ complexes. Protein complexes formed between rIDE and unlabeled Aβ peptide were detected and quantified by Western blot. Membranes were blocked with 5% low fat milk in PBS for 2 h at 37°C and with the indicated primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Immunoreactivity was detected with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-labeled IgG and enhanced chemiluminescence using ECL Plus reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Western blots were scanned with a STORM 860 fluorometer and analyzed with ImageQuaNT 5.1 software (Molecular Dynamics). For fluorescence assessment, PVDF membranes were equilibrated in PBS for 45 min, air-dried, and scanned in blue fluorescence mode with the photomultiplier set at 975 V. The intensity of the fluorescent signal as a function of peptide mass was determined by dot-blot on PVDF membranes with FAβs. The amount of total rIDE was estimated by Coomassie Blue staining of the same membranes used for fluorescence detection. For N-terminal sequence, proteins were digested with trypsin at 1:200 for 15 min at room temperature, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF. After staining with 0.1% Coomassie Blue the band of interest was cut and subjected to Edman degradation with a 477A sequencer (Applied Biosystems). In-gel Digestion—After SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, the band of 120 kDa containing the rIDE ·Aβ (FAβ17–27) complex was cut, and the gel slice was incubated in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8 (digestion buffer), with 45 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 60 °C. The tube was cooled at room temperature, and 100 mm iodoacetamide was added, followed by incubation for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. The gel was then washed in 50% ACN with shaking for 1 h, cut in 1-mm pieces, and transferred to a small tube. The gel pieces were shrunk in ACN, dried in a rotator evaporator, and re-swollen with 10 μl of digestion buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml endo-LysC (Roche Applied Science). The sample was incubated overnight at 37 °C, and digestion products were extracted twice from the gel with 60% ACN/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 20 min. Combined extractions were loaded into a C18 HPLC column and separated as described above. Seventy-six 1-min fractions were collected, and volumes were reduced to ∼50 μl with a rotator evaporator and applied to a PVDF membrane in PBS for dot-blot fluorescence detection and 4G8 immunoreactivity as described before. Those fractions in which the presence of FAβ17–27 was detected were further analyzed by mass spectrometry. Negative controls included digestion of rIDE alone and a blank piece of gel. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—FAβ peptides and products of endo-LysC of rIDE in the presence or absence of Aβ were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF). To produce the dried droplets, a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Fluka) was prepared using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid-30% ACN at room temperature. Equal volumes from this solution and the sample were mixed, and 1 μl was placed on the probe, allowed to dry, and analyzed on linear mode in an Omniflex spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). Calibration was performed with the following peptides for which average m/z values are shown in parentheses: bradykinin 1–7 (757.86), angiotensin I (1297.49), renin substrate (1760.04), microperoxidase (1862.95), insulin B chain (3496.92), and insulin (5734.54). Peptides were identified with the Flex-Analysis 2.2 software (Bruker), and the Find Pep program available on the ExPASy Proteomic Server. Precision for analysis was set at <0.1%. All the peaks identified as fragments of rIDE were distributed in 100-residue segments of the recombinant enzyme, and the relative frequency for each segment was expressed as the percentage of the total peaks assigned to rIDE. IDE and Aβ Form a Complex That Resists Dissociation with Strong Denaturants—After incubating synthetic Aβ1–40 (25 μm) with rat rIDE (1 μm), a Western blot with antibody 6E10 specific for Aβ 4–13 showed, in addition to the digestion of the monomeric peptide, a 120-kDa component consistent with a complex between the protease (∼115 kDa) and Aβ (∼4 kDa). This high molecular weight component was not present when Aβ was incubated alone, ruling out an oli"
https://openalex.org/W2148246782,"Left-right (L-R) asymmetry is a fundamental feature of higher-order neural function. However, the molecular basis of brain asymmetry remains unclear. We recently reported L-R asymmetry of hippocampal circuitry caused by differential allocation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunit GluRepsilon2 (NR2B) in hippocampal synapses. Using electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry, here we analyzed the hippocampal circuitry of the inversus viscerum (iv) mouse that has a randomized laterality of internal organs. The iv mouse hippocampus lacks L-R asymmetry, it exhibits right isomerism in the synaptic distribution of the epsilon2 subunit, irrespective of the laterality of visceral organs. This independent right isomerism of the hippocampus is the first evidence that a distinct mechanism downstream of the iv mutation generates brain asymmetry."
https://openalex.org/W2017797144,"Gangliosides are key players in neuronal inhibition, with antibody-mediated clustering of gangliosides blocking neurite outgrowth in cultures and axonal regeneration post injury. In this study we show that the ganglioside GT1b can form a complex with the Nogo-66 receptor NgR1. The interaction is shown by analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation and is mediated by the sialic acid moiety on GT1b, with mutations in FRG motifs on NgR1 attenuating the interaction. One FRG motif was developed into a cyclic peptide (N-AcCLQKFRGSSC-NH2) antagonist of GT1b, reversing the GT1b antibody inhibition of cerebellar granule cell neurite outgrowth. Interestingly, the peptide also antagonizes neurite outgrowth inhibition mediated by soluble forms of the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). Structure function analysis of the peptide point to the conserved FRG triplet being the minimal functional motif, and mutations within this motif inhibit NgR1 binding to both GT1b and MAG. Finally, using gene ablation, we show that the cerebellar neuron response to GT1b antibodies and soluble MAG is indeed dependent on NgR1 function. The results suggest that gangliosides inhibit neurite outgrowth by interacting with FRG motifs in the NgR1 and that this interaction can also facilitate the binding of MAG to the NgR1.

Furthermore, passive immunization with anti-ganglioside antibodies directly inhibits axonal regeneration after injury in mice (4Lehmann H.C. Lopez P.H. Zhang G. Ngyuen T. Zhang J. Kieseier B.C. Mori S. Sheikh K.A. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A considerable body of evidence also suggests that autoimmune anti-ganglioside antibodies might contribute to the poor prognosis of some patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome (5Walsh F.S. Cronin M. Koblar S. Doherty P. Winer J. Leon A. Hughes R.A. J. Neuroimmunol. 1991; 34: 43-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and other peripheral neuropathies (6Willison H.J. Yuki N. Brain. 2002; 125: 2591-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). A better understanding of the mechanisms whereby ganglioside antibodies inhibits neurite outgrowth and the development of agents to circumvent this might lead to novel therapeutic opportunities for some peripheral neuropathies. The myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) can inhibit neurite outgrowth (7McKerracher L. David S. Jackson D.L. Kottis V. Dunn R.J. Braun P.E. Neuron. 1994; 13: 805-811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 8Mukhopadhyay G. Doherty P. Walsh F.S. Crocker P.R. Filbin M.T. Neuron. 1994; 13: 757-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). The response to soluble MAG and GT1b antibodies are not obviously different when compared side by side (1Vinson M. Strijbos P.J. Rowles A. Facci L. Moore S.E. Simmons D.L. Walsh F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20280-20285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). MAG can bind directly to gangliosides including GT1b (9Collins B.E. Yang L.J. Mukhopadhyay G. Filbin M.T. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Schnaar R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1248-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and the presence of complex gangliosides in neurons is required for MAG function (10Mehta N.R. Lopez P.H. Vyas A.A. Schnaar R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27875-27886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This suggests that in some circumstances MAG inhibits neurite outgrowth by binding to and activating a GT1b receptor complex in an antibody-like manner. In support, the inhibitory response to soluble MAG and ganglioside antibodies requires activation of RhoA (Ras homolog gene family A) (1Vinson M. Strijbos P.J. Rowles A. Facci L. Moore S.E.

J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It follows that insights into how anti-ganglioside antibodies inhibit neurite outgrowth might be gleaned from understanding how MAG inhibits neurite outgrowth and vice versa. MAG can bind to a receptor complex in neurons that contain the Nogo-66 receptor NgR1 (11Fournier A.E. GrandPre T. Strittmatter S.M.

McCoy J.M. Pepinsky R.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The p75NTR receptor is the key signaling component of the complex, and GT1b also appears to be associated with the complex as antibodies to GT1b can immunoprecipitate p75NTR from neurons (3Fujitani M. Kawai H. Proia R.L. Kashiwagi A. Yasuda H. Yamashita T. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Yamashita T. Higuchi H. Tohyama M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). These data suggest that GT1b could facilitate the interaction between MAG and the NgR1, and indeed enzymes that remove sialic acid from complex gangliosides inhibit soluble MAG binding to NgR1 and NgR2 in cells (19Venkatesh K. Chivatakarn O. Lee H. Joshi P.S. Kantor D.B. Newman B.A. Mage R. Rader C. Giger R.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 808-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and inhibit MAG function (20DeBellard M.E. Tang S. Mukhopadhyay G. Shen Y.J. Filbin M.T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Recent studies using independently generated lines of mice that lack the NgR1 have clearly shown that the ability of soluble MAG to induce growth cone collapse from dorsal root ganglion neurons is dependent on this receptor (21Kim J.E. Liu B.P. Park J.H. Strittmatter S.M. Neuron. 2004; 44: 439-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 22Chivatakarn O. Kaneko S. He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M. Giger R.J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7117-7124Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, the later study also provided conclusive evidence that the NgR1 is not required for the function of substrate bound MAG. In the present study we have used analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation to demonstrate that GT1b can form higher order complexes with the NgR1. The binding required the presence of sialic acid on the ganglioside and was inhibited when any one of three independent FRG motifs in the NgR1 was mutated. One NgR1 sequence that contains an FRG motif (LQKFRGSS) lends itself well to the design of a cyclic peptide mimetic (N-Ac-CLQKFRGSSC-NH2). This mimetic peptide prevented GT1b antibodies from inhibiting neurite outgrowth. These data suggest that the inhibitory activity of anti-GT1b antibodies is dependent on NgR1 function. In support we show that GT1b antibodies do not inhibit neurite outgrowth from neurons isolated from mice that have the NgR1 gene genetically ablated from the germline. The same NgR1 peptide that inhibited the GT1b antibody response also antagonized the response stimulated by soluble MAG, with alanine scanning identifying the FRG sequence as the functional motif within the peptide. These data suggest that in some circumstances soluble MAG can inhibit neurite outgrowth through the ganglioside/NgR1 pathway. In support, mutations of the FRG motif that inhibit GT1b binding to the NgR1 also inhibit MAG binding to the receptor, and the inhibitory activity of soluble MAG was significant attenuated in neurons that do not express the NgR1. However, it is also clear that substrate-bound MAG can inhibit neurite outgrowth in the absence of NgR1 function (22Chivatakarn O. Kaneko S. He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M. Giger R.J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7117-7124Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and, in accord the NgR1 derived inhibitory peptides identified in this study, are not expected to, and indeed do not, inhibit the function of substrate-bound MAG. Neurite Outgrowth Assays—Cerebellar granule neurons isolated from post-natal day 2–3 rats or from day 3–5 mice were cultured over monolayers of 3T3 cells essentially as previously described (23Williams E. Williams G. Gour B.J. Blaschuk O.W. Doherty P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4007-4012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Monolayers were established by seeding ∼80,000 3T3 cells into individual chambers of an 8-chamber tissue culture slide coated with poly-l-lysine and fibronectin. In general, co-cultures were established by removing the media from the monolayers and seeding ∼6000 dissociated cerebellar neurons into each well in SATO medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.062 mg/liter progester-one, 16.1 mg/liter putrescine, 0.4 mg/liter thyroxine, 0.039 mg/liter selenium, 0.337 mg/liter triiodothyronine, 10 mg/liter insulin (bovine pancreas), 100 mg/liter transferrin (human)) supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum. However, in some experiments the co-cultures were maintained in neurobasal medium + B27 + 1% l-glutamate + 1% penicillin/streptomycin + 25 mm KCl. Monolayers were established for 24 h before the addition of the neurons, and the cultures were maintained for ∼23–27 h before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. In general, the neurons were stained with a GAP-43 antibody, and the mean length of the longest neurite per cell was measured for ∼120–150 neurons, again as previously described (23Williams E. Williams G. Gour B.J. Blaschuk O.W. Doherty P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4007-4012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, in some experiments neurons were labeled using TUJ1 (anti-βIII tubulin) followed by anti-mouse IgG-Alexa488, and nuclei were labeled with Hoechst. Mean total neurite length was calculated using the Neuronal Profiling bioapplication on a Cellomics ArrayScan. Similar results were obtained using both methods. For neurite outgrowth on substrate-bound MAG, 96-well plates were coated with a thin layer of nitrocellulose before incubating with 1 μg/ml MAG(d1–5) at 4 °C overnight. Wells were subsequently coated with 17 μg/ml of poly-d-lysine (Sigma) followed by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Rat cerebellar granule neurons were dissociated and seeded at a density of 1 × 104 cells per well. Cells were cultured for 18–20 h before being fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with a neuronal specific anti-βIII-tubulin antibody. The average of total neurite lengths from each neuron was measured automatically by the Meta-Xpress Neurite Outgrowth module (Molecular Devices) from at least 200 neurons per well, in triplicate wells per experiment. Results were repeated independently more than three times. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blots—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cells (100 mm dishes) were transfected with p75NTR and various mutants of the NgR1. The cells were harvested after 24 h and lysed in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Sigma) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatants were collected, and a protein assay (Bio-Rad) was performed. Protein lysates (0.5 mg) were preincubated with protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C for 1 h, then incubated with 2 μg of goat anti human NgR antibody (R&D Systems) plus protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad). Supernatants were subjected to 4–12% NuPAGE (Invitrogen), transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), and probed with antibodies to the NgR and p75NTR (Promega). Western blot images were analyzed on a Storm gel imaging system using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Whole brains from adult 129/lex, NgR1 knock-out, and NgR2 knock-out mice were homogenized and sonicated in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Sigma). Supernatants were collected after centrifugation, and a protein assay (Bio-Rad) was preformed. Protein lysates were subjected to 4–12% NuPAGE (Invitrogen), transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), and probed with antibodies to NgR1 or NgR2 (R&D Systems). Western blot images (see supplemental Fig. 1b) were scanned and analyzed by Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor). Construction of NgR1 Mutants—Human NgR1 point mutants were constructed using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The wild type human NgR1 cDNA (IMAGE:2121045 3) in a mammalian expression vector was used as a template to construct all the described mutants. Receptor Binding Assay—COS-7 cells were co-transfected with either wild type or mutant NgR1 constructs along with a cytomegalovirus-β-gangliosidase plasmid (pCMVb, BD Biosciences) as a transfection control. Transfection was performed in six-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The next day cells were trypsinized and seeded at 30,000 cells per well in poly-lysine-coated 96-well plates (BD Biosciences). At that time, two sister plates were established, one of which was used in the binding assay, and the other was used to correct for transfection efficiency by measuring β-galactosidase activity (see below). Remaining cells were separately plated and assayed for surface expression of the NgR1 proteins by immunocytochemistry and for total NgR1 protein levels by Western blotting. All mutant proteins were expressed on the cell surface and produced in comparable amounts to the wild type protein (data not shown). The next day wells were rinsed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% NaN3, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, at room temperature followed by incubation with 100 μl of fusion protein MAG-alkaline phosphatase (AP) diluted to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, for 90 min. After this, wells were washed 6 times with gentle shaking in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, at room temperature, 5 min each wash. Cells were then fixed with acetone-formaldehyde (60-3%, in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0) for 15 s at room temperature then washed 3 times for 5 min each with Hanks' balanced salt solution. Binding of AP-tagged ligands was then measured using the Great EscAPe SEAP kit (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Briefly, after aspirating Hanks' balanced salt solution, a 60-μl dilution buffer was added to each well, and the plates were sealed and then incubated at 65 °C for 90 min. Plates were cooled on ice, and then 60 μl of assay buffer was added per well and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Sixty microliters of diluted chemiluminescent alkaline phosphatase substrate was then added per well, incubated 10 min at room temperature, and then read on a LMAXII luminometer (Molecular Devices). Absolute binding numbers were corrected by subtracting average binding values obtained from mock-transfected controls. Binding was further corrected for sample-to-sample variations in transfection efficiency by normalizing to β-galactosidase activity. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using the luminescent β-galactosidase detection kit II (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Three independent binding experiments were conducted with at least six replicates per experiment. Background was subtracted, and β-galactosidase-corrected binding values were expressed relative to the wild type receptor. Preparation of AP-tagged Fusion Proteins—A fusion protein (Nogo66-AP) containing an N-terminal human placental AP and a C-terminal Nogo66 domain was constructed by ligating nucleotides encoding amino acids 1055–1120 of human NogoA (reticulon-4, NP_065393) to sequences encoding amino acids 23–511 of AP (NM_001632). This fusion was further modified by changing amino acid 47 of the Nogo66 sequence from cysteine to valine and introducing six consecutive histidine residues at the C terminus. The coding sequence was inserted into a mammalian expression vector and transiently transfected into HEK293GT cells (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The next day serum-free medium (Free Style 293, Invitrogen) was added, and cells were incubated a further 48 h before collection of crude conditioned medium. Nogo66-AP concentration was determined by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity and by Western blotting for alkaline phosphatase. A stable CHO cell line expressing a fusion protein containing an N-terminal human myelin-associated glycoprotein (human MAG; NM_002361; amino acids 1–516) and a C-terminal AP domain (amino acids 23–511) bearing six C-terminal histidine residues was created (referred to as MAG-AP). Cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 48 h; the conditioned medium was collected, and the fusion protein was purified using TALON cobalt affinity chromatography (Clontech) following the manufacturer's protocol. MAG-AP concentration was determined by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity and by Western blotting for alkaline phosphatase and MAG. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed on a Beckman XLI/XLA analytical ultracentrifuge. NgR1(310)-fc (0.21 or 0.38 μm final) was added to ganglioside at increasing ganglioside concentrations from 0 to 48 μm. Mutant protein used in the sedimentation velocity experiments corresponded to the column fraction of greatest purity based on SDS gel analysis. Wild type or mutant NgR(310)-Fc was added to Tris-buffered saline (TBS) buffer or TBS buffer containing GT1b to a final concentration of 16–30 μg/ml protein and 0 or 22 μm GT1b in a microcentrifuge tube. The solution, 400 μl, was loaded into 2-channel (1.2-cm path length) carbon-Epon centerpieces in an An-50-Ti rotor. Scans were recorded at 20 °C with a rotor speed of 35,000 rpm, and the signal was detected at 230 nm with a spacing of 0.006 in the continuous mode. Sedimentation profiles were analyzed by the program Sedfit (24Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar) to obtain the sedimentation coefficient distributions. The solvent density (1.006) and partial specific volume (0.72) were calculated using the program Sednterp (25Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Neuraminidase Treatment—CHO parental cells and NgR1 stable cells were seeded at 30,000 cells per well in 96-well plates the night before the assay. Various concentrations of Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase (Roche Applied Science) in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified eagle medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum) were incubated with cells for 1 h at 37 °C. Medium was replaced with affinity-purified MAG-AP or Nogo66-AP in Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum and 20 nm HEPES and incubated at room temperature for 90 min. Cells were then washed four times with supplemented Hanks' balanced salt solution. Alto-Phos (0.6 mg/ml) (Promega) was added to indicate of bound ligands. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the plates were read at emission/excitation wavelength of 400 nm/505 nm by FlexStationII384 (Molecular Devices). Reagents—Synthetic peptides were all obtained from a commercial supplier (Multiple Peptide Systems). All peptides were purified to the highest grade by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and obtained at the highest level of purity (>97%). With all peptides there was no indication of higher molecular weight species. Where peptide sequences are underlined, this denotes a peptide that has been cyclized via a disulfide bond between the given cysteine residues. All peptides were acetylated and amide-blocked. Recombinant MAG-Fc chimera was obtained from R&D Systems and used at a final concentration of 5–25 μg/ml. The monoclonal antibody to GT1b (clone GMR5) was obtained from Seikagaku America and was used at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. All reagents were diluted into the co-culture media and in general added to the cultures just before plating of the neurons. GT1b and GM1 were a kind gift of Dr. Gino Toffano. Asialo-GM1 was obtained from Sigma. The recombinant NgR1(310)-Fc chimera and the extracellular portion of MAG(d1–5) were expressed and purified in-house. Pharmacological reagents were obtained from Calbiochem and/or Sigma. Generation and Characterization of NgR1 and NgR2 Knockout Mice—Targeting vectors (see supplemental Fig. 1a) were introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells of the 129SvBrd background via electroporation. Homologously targeted integrants were selected in G418 (0.4 g/liter) and identified by Southern blotting using probes external to the targeting vector on both the 5′ and 3′ sides. Retention of the 5′-most loxP site in the targeted cells was determined by PCR of genomic DNA using the following primers: for NgR1 allele, 5′-GGTCTAGGGATGCATCTCAG and 5′-ACATCTGAAGGCCTTCTGG; for the NgR2 allele, 5′-GTTGGTGGGGTTCTTGTCTCAGG and 5′-GGCCTGGCCCCCTCCCTTCAC. Embryonic stem cells were used to establish mouse lines and animals bearing the NgR1f and NgR2f alleles were crossed to Prm-cre transgenic mice (26O'Gorman S. Dagenais N.A. Qian M. Marchuk Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14602-14607Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The Prm-cre transgene directs expression of cre recombinase in the male germline. Therefore, males harboring the transgene along with the NgR1f or NgR2f allele transmit the non-functional NgR1d or NgR2d alleles, respectively, to their offspring. Cre-mediated recombination of the floxed (f) alleles to the deleted (d) alleles was detected by PCR of genomic DNA using the following primers: for NgR1, 5′-GGTCTAGGGATGCATCTCAG and 5′-GTGGTCTGTGTGGCTCCTGC; for NgR2, 5′-GTTGGTGGGGTTCTTGTCTCAGG and 5′-CCCCCCTGCCCCAGCTACGC. All alleles were maintained on the 129SvBrd background. Binding Motifs on the NgR1—There are two published crystal structures of the NgR1, Protein Data Bank accessions 1OZN (27He X.L. Bazan J.F. McDermott G. Park J.B. Wang K. Tessier-Lavigne M. He Z. Garcia K.C. Neuron. 2003; 38: 177-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and 1P8T (28Barton W.A. Liu B.P. Tzvetkova D. Jeffrey P.D. Fournier A.E. Sah D. Cate R. Strittmatter S.M. Nikolov D.B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3291-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), but currently no ligand-receptor complex structure has been solved. Detailed mutagenesis studies have recently mapped the residues critical for the binding of MAG to the receptor (29Lauren J. Hu F. Chin J. Liao J. Airaksinen M.S. Strittmatter S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5715-5725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and these are illustrated in Fig. 1a. Small ligand binding sites show up as cavities and can be revealed by the clustering of a small probe under the influence of a van der Waals potential. In Fig. 1b we show the two lowest energy clusters for a probe with van der Waals radius of 3.5 Å. The potential binding pockets lie on the convex side of the protein, and interestingly, both neighbor FRG triplet motifs that can be found in the other NgRs (discussed in detail below). Sialic acid residues on gangliosides and possibly other glycoconjugates bind directly to an FRG motif in MAG itself (30Tang S. Woodhall R.W. Shen Y.J. deBellard M.E. Saffell J.L. Doherty P. Walsh F.S. Filbin M.T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These observations have led us to develop the hypothesis that gangliosides can interact with FRG motifs in the NgR and that this interaction might facilitate MAG binding to the receptor. Binding of MAG, but Not Nogo66, to NgR1 Is Partially Sensitive to Neuraminidase—In neurons soluble MAG binds to the NgR1 and NgR2 in a sialic acid-dependent manner (19Venkatesh K. Chivatakarn O. Lee H. Joshi P.S. Kantor D.B. Newman B.A. Mage R. Rader C. Giger R.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 808-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the present study we confirmed the neuraminidase sensitivity of MAG binding to the NgR1 expressed in CHO cells. The data show that over a wide range of concentrations (2.5–20 μg/ml) the specific binding of the MAG-AP fusion protein to NgR1-expressing cells is partially inhibited (55%) by treating the CHO cells with neuraminidase. The effect was dependent upon the concentration of neuraminidase, and even at the highest concentration Nogo66-AP binding remained completely unaffected (Fig. 2). These data suggest that MAG binding to the NgR1 is dependent at least in part on sialic acid binding to the receptor. Effects of Loop 2 and Additional FRG Mutations on GT1b Binding to the NgR1—GT1b is a sialic acid-containing ganglioside that has previously been reported to be a key component of the MAG receptor complex (18Yamashita T. Higuchi H. Tohyama M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 31Vyas A.A. Patel H.V. Fromholt S.E. Heffer-Lauc M. Vyas K.A. Dang J. Schachner M. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8412-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We have tested whether GT1b can bind directly to the ectodomain of the NgR1 using analytical ultracentrifugation. In the absence of GT1b, the dimeric NgR1(310)-Fc migrates with a sedimentation coefficient of ∼6.5 S (Fig. 3). In the presence of low μm concentrations of GT1b, the 6.5 S species decreases, and additional peaks with higher sedimentation coefficients appear in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3a). In this assay, GM1 can also interact with NgR1 (Fig. 3b), which suggests that the interaction might be dependent on sialic acid. In support, no change in sedimentation coefficient of the NgR1(310)-Fc is observed in the presence of asialo-GM1. No effect was observed upon the addition of 22 μm GT1b to anti-hNgR AF 1208 antibody from R&D, which provides additional evidence that the interaction of GT1b with NgR1 is specific (not shown). We next determined if the binding of GT1b to the NgR1 was sensitive to mutation of the FRG motifs. Importantly, based on the relative ratios of the ∼6.7- and ∼11-S peaks, it can be estimated that mutation of the arginine 279 to an aspartic acid reduced binding to ∼56% that of wild type NgR, suggesting this site play"
https://openalex.org/W2041713622,"Background Anopheles gambiae, a major vector of malaria, is widely distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa. In an attempt to eliminate infective mosquitoes, researchers are trying to develop transgenic strains that are refractory to the Plasmodium parasite. Before any release of transgenic mosquitoes can be envisaged, we need an accurate picture of the differentiation between the two molecular forms of An. gambiae, termed M and S, which are of uncertain taxonomic status. Methodology/Principal Findings Insertion patterns of three transposable elements (TEs) were determined in populations from Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, and Tanzania, using Transposon Display, a TE-anchored strategy based on Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism. The results reveal a clear differentiation between the M and S forms, whatever their geographical origin, suggesting an incipient speciation process. Conclusions/Significance Any attempt to control the transmission of malaria by An. gambiae using either conventional or novel technologies must take the M/S genetic differentiation into account. In addition, we localized three TE insertion sites that were present either in every individual or at a high frequency in the M molecular form. These sites were found to be located outside the chromosomal regions that are suspected of involvement in the speciation event between the two forms.

We modified Charnov's classic diet composition model to describe the ecological dynamics of the related generalist and specialist bacteriophages phiX174 and G4, and confirmed that specialist phages are ecologically favored only at high host densities. Our modified model accurately predicted the ecological dynamics of phage populations in laboratory microcosms, but had only limited success predicting evolutionary dynamics. We monitored evolution of attachment rate, the phenotype that governs diet breadth, in phage populations adapting to both low and high host density microcosms. Although generalist phiX174 populations evolved even broader diets at low host density, they did not show a tendency to evolve the predicted specialist foraging strategy at high host density. Similarly, specialist G4 populations were unable to evolve the predicted generalist foraging strategy at low host density. These results demonstrate that optimal foraging models developed to explain the behaviorally determined diets of predators may have only limited success predicting the genetically determined diets of bacteriophage, and that optimal foraging probably plays a smaller role than genetic constraints in the evolution of host specialization in bacteriophages."
https://openalex.org/W2036573699,"Membrane type 1 (MT1) matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-14) is a membrane-tethered MMP considered to be a major mediator of pericellular proteolysis. MT1-MMP is regulated by a complex array of mechanisms, including processing and endocytosis that determine the pool of active proteases on the plasma membrane. Autocatalytic processing of active MT1-MMP generates an inactive membrane-tethered 44-kDa product (44-MT1) lacking the catalytic domain. This form preserves all other enzyme domains and is retained at the cell surface. Paradoxically, accumulation of the 44-kDa form has been associated with increased enzymatic activity. Here we report that expression of a recombinant 44-MT1 (Gly285–Val582) in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells results in enhanced pro-MMP-2 activation, proliferation within a three-dimensional collagen I matrix, and tumor growth and lung metastasis in mice. Stimulation of pro-MMP-2 activation and growth in collagen I was also observed in other cell systems. Expression of 44-MT1 in HT1080 cells is associated with a delay in the rate of active MT1-MMP endocytosis resulting in higher levels of active enzyme at the cell surface. Consistently, deletion of the cytosolic domain obliterates the stimulatory effects of 44-MT1 on MT1-MMP activity. In contrast, deletion of the hinge turns the 44-MT1 form into a negative regulator of enzyme function in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a key role for the hinge region in the functional relationship between active and processed MT1-MMP. Together, these results suggest a novel role for the 44-kDa form of MT1-MMP generated during autocatalytic processing in maintaining the pool of active enzyme at the cell surface.

This is partly achieved by the action of endogenous protease inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which bind to the active site inhibiting catalysis (15Nagase H. Visse R. Murphy G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 69: 562-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). In addition, by virtue of being a membrane-anchored protease, MT1-MMP developed a unique set of regulatory mechanisms that control enzymatic activity independently of TIMPs. These processes include the targeting of active enzyme to specific plasma membrane locations, endocytosis, and autocatalytic processing (1Itoh Y. Seiki M. J. Cell.

Together, these distinct processes determine the level of active enzyme on the cell surface. However, how these processes are integrated to control the pool of active MT1-MMP is not understood. The processing of MT1-MMP is a cell surface event in which the active enzyme is usually autocatalytically cleaved in trans to generate a major membrane-anchored product of ∼44 kDa (also referred to as the 43- or 45-kDa species in some studies) and a soluble ∼18-kDa inactive fragment of the catalytic domain (6Hernandez-Barrantes S.

Collectively, these findings suggest a relationship between processing and the level and activity of MT1-MMP at the cell surface. Although MT1-MMP processing is thought to terminate activity on the cell surface, the structural characteristics of the remnant 44-kDa product suggest that it may play a more complex role in enzyme regulation. The 44-kDa species is composed of the hinge region, the hemopexin-like domain, and the complete anchoring apparatus with its cytosolic tail. Furthermore, the 44-kDa fragment is retained on the cell surface, and like active MT1-MMP it is also cleared from the cell surface by endocytosis (28Remacle A. Murphy G. Roghi C. J.

Given these conflicting observations, we set forth to investigate the functional relationship between active MT1-MMP and its processed 44-kDa form in various cellular settings and its effect on enzyme function in vitro and in vivo. We present evidence that the 44-kDa form of MT1-MMP positively influences the level and activity of surface MT1-MMP by regulating enzyme internalization. This positive effect of the processed form depends on the presence of the hinge region. We propose a model in which the 44-kDa form of MT1-MMP regulates the endocytosis of the active protease to preserve a viable level of MT1-MMP on the cell surface. Cell Culture—Human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells, human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells, human breast carcinoma T47D cells, and monkey kidney epithelial BS-C-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). HT1080, MDA-MB-231, and BS-C-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. T47D cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, insulin, and antibiotics. Human glioma U87 cells were a gift from Dr. Bonnie Sloane (Wayne State University, Detroit, MI) and were cultured in minimum essential media supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. Human breast carcinoma BT549 cells, a kind gift from Dr. Hyeong-Reh Choi Kim (Wayne State University, Detroit, MI), were cultured in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. HeLa cells (CCL-2.2) were obtained from the ATCC and were cultured in Spinner medium (Quality Biologicals Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 5% horse serum and antibiotics. Recombinant Vaccinia Viruses—The production of the recombinant vaccinia virus (vTF7-3) expressing bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase has been described (66Fuerst T.R. Earl P.L. Moss B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing human pro-MMP-2, TIMP-2, or TIMP-1 were obtained by homologous recombination, as described previously (66Fuerst T.R. Earl P.L. Moss B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Recombinant Proteins and Antibodies—Human recombinant pro-MMP-2, TIMP-2, and TIMP-1 were expressed in HeLa cells infected with the appropriate recombinant vaccinia viruses and purified to homogeneity, as described previously (67Olson M.W. Gervasi D.C. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29975-29983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) 437, raised against residues 437–454 of the hemopexin-like domain of human MT1-MMP was described previously (6Hernandez-Barrantes S. Toth M. Bernardo M.M.

The rabbit pAb 198 raised against a synthetic peptide including residues 160–174 of the catalytic domain of human MT1-MMP was a generous gift from Dr. Q. X.

The LEM2/15 monoclonal antibody (mAb), a generous gift from Dr. A. Arroyo (Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares, Madrid, Spain), was raised against a synthetic peptide comprising residues 218–233 of the catalytic domain of human MT1-MMP (69Galvez B.G. Matias-Roman S. Albar J.P. Sanchez-Madrid F. Arroyo A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37491-37500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The rabbit pAb to the cytosolic domain of MT1-MMP (RP2-MMP-14) was purchased from Triple Point Biologics, Inc. (Forest Grove, OR). The rabbit pAb 815 against the hinge domain of MT1-MMP was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The mAb to the human transferrin receptor was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. The mAb to β-actin was purchased from Sigma. MT1-MMP cDNA Constructs—To express the 44-kDa form of MT1-MMP (referred to as 44-MT1 in Fig. 1A), the entire catalytic domain of MT1-MMP (Tyr112 to Gly284) was deleted by mutagenic PCR from pro-MT1-MMP using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), specific primers, and wild-type pro-MT1-MMP cDNA as the template. This procedure generated a cDNA fragment in which the furin-recognition motif ending at Arg111 was positioned immediately upstream of Gly285 at the beginning of the hinge region. This cDNA fragment was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) expression vector for stable transfection, the pTF7-EMCV-1 vector for transient expression in the vaccinia expression system (66Fuerst T.R. Earl P.L. Moss B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and the pIND vector for inducible expression in response to ponasterone A (Invitrogen). In addition, we generated a series of cDNA constructs to express 44-MT1 lacking the cytosolic tail (ending at Arg563 and referred to as 44ΔCT; Fig. 1A) and 44-MT1 lacking the hinge region (residues 285–315 and referred to as 44ΔH; Fig. 1A). These cDNA constructs were inserted into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector. The correct sequence of all the cDNA constructs was verified by DNA sequencing of both strands. Stable Transfections—Cells (HT1080, MDA-MB-231, U87, and T47D) were stably transfected with empty pcDNA3.1 vector (referred to as EV cells) or pcDNA3.1/44-MT1 vector (referred to as 44-MT1 cells) using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described by the manufacturer. T47D breast carcinoma cells were also transfected with wild-type MT1-MMP in pcDNA3.1 vector. Geneticin® (G418 sulfate, Invitrogen)-resistant pooled populations were selected using conventional approaches. HT1080 and U87 cells were also transfected with 44ΔCT and 44ΔH in pcDNA3.1, and both clones and pooled populations were obtained by Geneticin® selection. For most studies, both pooled populations and representative single clones were used. For in vivo studies, two representative clones with each construct, which varied in detected amounts of recombinant protein expression, were pooled (pooled clones). Inducible Expression System—BT549 breast carcinoma cells were double-transfected with the pVgRXR vector (Invitrogen), which expresses the heterodimeric ecdysone receptor and the retinoid X receptor, and the pIND-inducible expression vector that expresses a modified ecdysone-response element upstream of a minimal heat shock promoter and a multiple cloning site. In the presence of ponasterone A, heterodimeric receptors binding to a modified ecdysone-response element induce expression of the 44-MT1 cDNA that was previously inserted into the pIND-inducible expression plasmid (Invitrogen). Infection-Transfection—BS-C-1 cells seeded in 6-well plates were infected with 1 plaque-forming unit/cell of vTF7-3 vaccinia virus for 45 min in DMEM containing 2.5% FBS. The media were removed, and the infected cells were co-transfected with pTF7-EMCV-1 vector expressing wild-type MT1-MMP alone or 44-MT1 at 1:1 and 1:10 molar ratios (MT1-MMP:44-MT1) or with empty vector alone, up to a total of 3 μg of plasmid DNA/well using Effectene. The next day, the cells were incubated with 10 nm recombinant pro-MMP-2 for 30 min at 37 °C in serum-free media. The lysates and media were collected and subjected to immunoblot analysis and gelatin zymography, respectively, as described below. Immunoblot Analyses—Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 100 mm NaCl) supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), on ice for 1 h.

We isolated a novel gene from a wheat root cDNA library, which conferred Cd(II)-specific tolerance when expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The gene, which we called TaTM20, for Triticum aestivum transmembrane 20, encodes a putative hydrophobic polypeptide of 889 amino acids, containing 20 transmembrane domains arranged as a 5-fold internal repeating unit of 4 transmembrane domains each. Expression of TaTM20 in yeast cells stimulated Cd(II) efflux resulting in a decrease in the content of yeast intracellular cadmium. TaTM20-induced Cd(II) tolerance was maintained in yeast even under conditions of reduced GSH. These results demonstrate that TaTM20 enhances Cd(II) tolerance in yeast through the stimulation of Cd(II) efflux from the cell, partially independent of GSH. Treatment of wheat seedlings with Cd(II) induced their expression of TaTM20, decreasing subsequent root Cd(II) accumulation and suggesting a possible role for TaTM20 in Cd(II) tolerance in wheat.

Cadmium is one of the most dangerous heavy metals in the environment and poses a significant risk to human health (1Jarup L. Berglund M. Elinder C.G. Nordberg G. Vahter M. Scand. J. Work Environ. Health. 1998; 124: 1-51Google Scholar). Cadmium induces oxidative stress, which in turn mediates cellular damage in many plants and animals (2Hart B.A. Lee C.H. Shukla G.S. Shukla A. Osier M. Eneman J.D. Chiu J.F. Toxicology. 1999; 133: 43-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 3Sandalio L.M. Dalurzo H.C. Gomez M. Romero-Puertas M.C. del Rio L.A. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 364: 2115-2126Crossref Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). One of the effects of oxidative stress is disruption of the permeability control of the plasma membrane, leading to membrane breakage and subsequent cell death (4Koizumi T. Shirakura H. Kumagai H. Tatsumoto H. Suzuki K.T. Toxicology. 1996; 114: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Humans and livestock can be exposed to cadmium via many different routes, but the predominant one is food intake. Agricultural products can become contaminated by cadmium when grown in cadmium-contaminated soils. In addition to farm products, cadmium exists in materials used in our daily lives, including paint and batteries. Previous studies have shown that certain plant species are much more tolerant to cadmium than other plants (5Boominathan R. Doran P.M. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2003; 83: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 6Kupper H. Lombi E. Zhao F.J. McGrath S.P. Planta. 2000; 212: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Cadmium-tolerant plants have the ability to prevent the absorption of cadmium or detoxify cadmium after it has been absorbed. Plants secrete organic acids, such as oxalate, that precipitate cadmium in rhizospheres, preventing its absorption (7Nigam R. Srivastava S. Prakash S. Srivastava M.M. Plant Soil. 2001; 230: 107-113Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Translocation of cadmium from roots to shoots is inhibited by the Casparian strip of the plant endodermal layer (8Lux A. Sottnikova A. Opatrna J. Greger M. Physiol. Plant. 2004; 120: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Upon entry into the cell, plants employ diverse mechanisms of cadmium detoxification. Plants synthesize metal-chelating peptides, such as GSH and phytochelatins, or Cys-rich proteins. such as metallothioneins, that bind to Cd(II) and reduce its toxicity (9Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 428-430Crossref Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 10Ranieri A. Castagna A. Scebba F. Careri M. Zagnoni I. Predieri G. Pagliari M. di Toppi L.S. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2005; 43: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Another mechanism of detoxification involves transport of cadmium or Cd(II)-conjugated molecules across the plasma membrane and tonoplast. Cd(II)-GSH complexes are compartmentalized into vacuoles by transporters localized in the tonoplast (11Petrovic S. Pascolo L. Gallo R. Cupelli F. Ostrow J.D. Goffeau A. Tiribelli C. Bruschi C.V. Yeast. 2000; 16: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). AtMRP3, an ABC transporter, has been implicated in the sequestration of Cd(II)-GSH complexes in vacuoles (12Rea P.A. Li Z.S. Lu Y.P. Drozdowicz Y.M. Martinoia E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 727-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 13Tommasini R. Vogt E. Fromenteau M. Hortensteiner S. Matile P. Amrhein N. Martinoia E. Plant J. 1998; 13: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), and AtCAX2, an H+/Cd2+ exchanger (14Hirschi K.D. Korenkov V.D. Wilganowski N.L. Wagner G.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), mediates Cd(II) accumulation in vacuoles. The ABC transporter AtPDR8 is involved in Cd(II) efflux at the plasma membrane (15Kim D.-Y. Bovet L. Maeshima M. Martinoia E. Lee Y. Plant J. 2007; 50: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) and so is the plasma membrane multidrug efflux carrier AtDTX1 (16Li L. He Z. Pandey G.K. Tsuchiya T. Luan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5360-5368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Antioxidants and antioxidant-synthesizing enzymes have also been implicated in enhancing plant tolerance to heavy metals, particularly Cd(II) and nickel. Heavy metals induce ROS 5The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; AAS, atomic absorption spectroscopy; EV, empty vector; RT, reverse transcription; BSO, buthionine sulfoximine; WT, wild type; AChR, acetylcholine receptor; G3PDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. generation and increase the expression of genes that encode the antioxidant-synthesizing enzymes (17Dixit V. Pandey V. Shyam R. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 18Hsu Y.T. Kao C.H. Plant Growth Regul. 2004; 42: 227-238Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 19Vitoria A.P. Lea P.J. Azevedo R.A. Phytochemistry. 2001; 57: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Expression of genes that encode enzymes involved in repairing the damage caused by ROS improves Cd(II) tolerance. For example, overexpression of Arabidopsis aldehyde dehydrogenase, a scavenger of lipid peroxidation products, enhances tolerance to ROS-inducing stimuli, such as Cd(II), salt, and drought (20Sunkar R. Bartels D. Kirch H.H. Plant J. 2003; 35: 452-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In support of this mechanism of tolerance to heavy metals, many plants that are hyperaccumulators of nickel contain high antioxidant levels and high expression levels of the antioxidant-synthesizing enzymes (21Freeman J.L. Persans M.W. Nieman K. Albrecht C. Peer W. Pickering I.J. Salt D.E. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2176-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In this study, we isolated a novel gene involved in Cd(II) detoxification from a wheat root cDNA library. The gene encodes a protein with a structure indicative of a transporter molecule, with 20 putative transmembrane domains, hence we named this gene TaTM20. TaTM20 enhanced export of Cd(II) from yeast cells, and it conferred Cd(II) tolerance to yeast. In wheat, Cd(II) pretreatment up-regulated TaTM20 expression, and this wheat accumulated subsequently less Cd(II) in the root than control, which was not pretreated with Cd(II). These results suggest a potential role for this protein in Cd(II) tolerance in planta. Plant Growth Conditions—Seeds of wheat (Triticum aestivum Lcv. Atlas 66) were surface-sterilized, placed in the dark at 4 °C for 2 days, and then sown on ½ MS agar plates (22Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (54339) Google Scholar). The plants were grown under long day conditions (16 h light/8 h darkness) at 22/18 °C for 1 week. Isolation of TaTM20 from a Wheat Root cDNA Library—To isolate Cd(II) tolerance genes, we used a wheat root cDNA library constructed using mRNA isolated from 4-day-old wheat roots grown in K+-lacking medium (23Schachtman D.P. Schroeder J.L. Nature. 1994; 25: 655-658Crossref Scopus (497) Google Scholar), and we selected genes that functionally complement the YCF1-null, a Cd(II)-sensitive yeast strain DTY167 (MAT ura3-52 leu2-3,-112 his-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2-801 suc2-Δ9 ycf1::hisG; see Ref. 24Szczypka M.S. Wemmie J.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Thiel D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22853-22857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The genes in the cDNA library were introduced into the cells by the lithium acetate method (25Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transformants were plated on one-half synthetic galactose (½ SG) agar plates containing 60 μm CdCl2, and spot-forming transformants were selected and tested for Cd(II) tolerance. Plasmids DNA from Cd(II)-resistant transformants were isolated and sequenced, and then the full mRNA sequences of the genes were isolated using 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Full CDS-containing pYES2 (Invitrogen) plasmids were re-introduced into Δycf1 cells to confirm complementation by Cd(II) tolerance test. Generation of N- or C-terminal Truncated TaTM20 Constructs and Complementation Tests in Yeast—All N- or C-terminal truncations of TaTM20 were generated by PCR amplification and restriction enzyme digestion. The fidelity of the DNA sequences of the constructs was verified by automated DNA sequencing (ABI 3100, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The yeast Δycf1 and Δcup1 (MATα trp1-1, leu2-3, leu2-112, gal1, His-, ura3-50, cup1::ura3; see Ref. 26Hamer D.H. Thiele D.J. Lemontt J.E. Science. 1985; 228: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) strains and their isogenic wild type strains, DTY165 and DTY3, respectively, were transformed with the indicated constructs using the lithium acetate method. Transformants were selected on minimal medium plates lacking uracil (27Covello P.S. Reed D.W. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For the metal ion tolerance test, yeast containing the indicated constructs were grown on ½ SG agar plates in the absence or presence of 40 μm CdCl2, 1 mm Pb(NO3)2, 100 μm CuCl2, or 0.8 mm Na2HAsO4 at 30 °C for 3 days. Cadmium Content Measurement and Cd(II) Flux Assay in Yeast—For measurement of cadmium content in yeast, cells were incubated in SG broth containing 20 μm CdCl2 for 5 h at 30 °C with shaking and then harvested. Cells were briefly rinsed with ice-cold 0.1 m CaCl2 and ice-cold water, collected by centrifugation, and completely digested with 11 m HNO3 at 200 °C. Digested samples were diluted with deionized water and briefly vortexed. The diluted samples were then analyzed for ion content using AAS (SpectrAA-800, Varian, Palo Alto, CA) or inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (Optima 4300DU, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For the 109Cd(II) uptake assay, cells were incubated in SG medium supplemented with 10 μm CdCl2 containing 4.1 kBq liter-1 of 109Cd(II) for 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, or 240 min at 30 °C with shaking. At each time point, cells were harvested and rinsed twice with ice-cold 1 mm CaCl2. Radioactivity was measured using an automatic gamma counter (1470 Wizard, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 109Cd levels were counted at the energy windows of 22–88 keV. For the efflux assay, cells were incubated in SG medium supplemented with 6 μm CdCl2 containing 4.1 kBq of 109Cd(II) for 1 h at 30 °C with shaking and then harvested and rinsed with ice-cold 1 mm CaCl2 and SG medium. Cells were resuspended in SG medium and incubated for 0, 5, 15, 30, or 60 min at 30 °C with shaking. At each time point, cells were harvested and rinsed, and then radioactivity was measured as described for the uptake assay. Cd(II) Flux Assay in Wheat Seedlings Pretreated with Cd(II)— The pretreatment consisted of immersing the root parts of 7-day-old wheat seedlings into ½ MS liquid media supplemented with or without 100 μm CdCl2 for 6 h. They were then immersed into ½ MS liquid medium containing 2.4 kBq liter-1 of 109Cd(II). After 3 h of 109Cd(II) exposure to roots, shoot and root parts of wheat seedlings were harvested separately and rinsed twice with ice-cold distilled water. Radioactivity was measured as described above. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR and Real Time RT-PCR— Total RNA was extracted from 7-day-old wheat seedlings with TRIzol reagents. Five micrograms of total RNA was subjected to cDNA synthesis using a Powerscript™ RT-kit (Clontech) and oligo (dT) primers, according to the manufacturer's instructions. TaTM20 cDNA was amplified by PCR using the following primer pair: TaTM20 RTF (5′-AAGGGTTGCTCCTCTTCGCGATCTTG-3′) and TaTM20 RTR (5′-GTACATGCCAGCACCGTATGGATTG-3′). As a control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) was amplified in wheat seedlings (primers: TaG3PDHF, 5′-CAACGCTAGCTGCACCACTAACT-3′; TaG3PDHR, 5′-ACTCCTCCTTGATAGCAGCCTT-3′), together with TaTM20. Real time PCR was performed in triplicate using SYBER Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The sequences of the primers designed to amplify TaTM20 were as follows: 5′-CCGATCCTCTTGCACAACTA-3′ and 5′-ATGGACAGCATGAAGCTCAC-3′; the primers for G3PDH were as follows: 5′-TCACCACCGAGTACATGACC-3′ and 5′-TCGTCCTTGAGCTTGATGT-3′. Real time PCR analysis was performed on an Applied Biosystems Prism 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Isolation of a Cd(II) Tolerance Gene, TaTM20, from a Wheat Root cDNA Library—To screen for Cd(II) tolerance genes, a wheat root cDNA library (23Schachtman D.P. Schroeder J.L. Nature. 1994; 25: 655-658Crossref Scopus (497) Google Scholar) was introduced into the YCF1-null mutant yeast strain DTY167 (Δycf1). We identified two novel genes that conferred strong Cd(II) tolerance to Δycf1 mutant yeast, and we selected one of these genes for further characterization. We called it TaTM20, because it encoded a putative wheat protein with 20 transmembrane domains. To confirm the role of TaTM20 in Cd(II) tolerance, Δycf1 cells were transformed with pYES2:TaTM20 and plated on ½ SG agar medium supplemented with 40 μm CdCl2 for qualitative assessment, or grown in suspension cultures for quantitative assays. Δycf1 cells that expressed TaTM20 grew much better than those transformed with the control empty vector (EV) (Fig. 1A). They also grew better than wild type (WT) yeast transformed with EV (WT-EV, Fig. 1A). To characterize the Cd(II) tolerance phenotype of TaTM20-expressing yeast, cultures were grown in liquid SG media containing various concentrations of CdCl2 until they reached stationary phase (56 h), and cell suspension absorbance at 600 nm (A600) was measured using a spectrophotometer. In medium lacking Cd(II), the growth of TaTM20-transformed Δycf1 cells was similar to WT-EV cells or EV-transformed Δycf1 cells (Fig. 1B). In the presence of 40, 50, and 60 μm Cd(II), cell density decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. TaTM20-expressing Δycf1 cells grew better than WT-EV yeast, whereas EV-transformed Δycf1 cells did not grow as well as WT-EV cells (Fig. 1B). In the presence of 40 μm Cd(II), the final cell density of TaTM20-expressing Δycf1 cells was twice as high as Δycf1 cells transformed with EV (Fig. 1B). We then examined the time course of growth of the three yeast strains in the presence of Cd(II). In SG medium without Cd(II), the time-dependent growth of the three strains was similar (Fig. 1C, left panel). In the presence of 40 μm Cd(II), TaTM20-expressing Δycf1 cells grew more rapidly than either WT-EV or EV-transformed Δycf1 cells during the exponential growth phase, resulting in a much higher cell density in the stationary phase (Fig. 1C, right panel). A similar pattern of growth was observed in the presence of 50 and 60 μm Cd(II) (data not shown). To determine whether TaTM20 conferred tolerance to other metals, TaTM20- or EV-transformed Δycf1 cells were grown on ½ SG agar media supplemented with 0.8 mm Na2HAsO4 or 1 mm Pb(NO3)2. EV-transformed cells did not grow as well as wild type yeast on ½ SG media containing As(V) or Pb(II) (supplemental Fig. 1A), which was in agreement with previously published results (24Szczypka M.S. Wemmie J.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Thiel D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22853-22857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Preveral S. Ansoborlo E. Mari S. Vavasseur A. Forestier C.

Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). TaTM20 expression did not alter the sensitivity of Δycf1 cells to As(V) and Pb(II) (supplemental Fig. 1A). To determine whether TaTM20 conferred copper tolerance, the Δcup1 (copper metallothionein)-null mutant yeast strain DTY4 was transformed with pYES2: TaTM20, and cells were spotted onto ½ SG agar medium. EV-transformed Δcup1 cells grew less than WT-EV yeast on 100 μm CuCl2-containing media (supplemental Fig. 1B), as expected based on previously published results (26Hamer D.H. Thiele D.J. Lemontt J.E. Science. 1985; 228: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Expression of TaTM20 did not alter the growth of Δcup1 cells on Cu(II)-containing medium (supplemental Fig. 1B), indicating that TaTM20 does not play a role in tolerance to excess Cu(II). These results demonstrated that TaTM20 confers tolerance to Cd(II) but does not affect the tolerance of yeast cells to As(V), Pb(II), or Cu(II). TaTM20 Sequence Analysis and Prediction of TaTM20 Structure—The cDNA sequence and predicted amino acid sequence of TaTM20 are shown in Fig. 2A. TaTM20 encodes a novel gene (GenBank™ accession number DQ323065), based on examination of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and cDNA sequences deposited in the GenBank™ data base. We screened the TIGR data base for homologues of TaTM20 in rice, and found that at the amino acid level TaTM20 has 24% identity and 33% similarity with ZmTM20 (dek34 embryogenesis protein) from Zea mays (30Stiefel V. Becerra E.L. Roca R. Bastida M. Jahrmann T. Graziano E. Puigdomenech P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 39: 27734-27739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and 26–50% identity and 36–60% similarity with 20 rice homologues. Phylogenetic tree shows that TaTM20 is a member of a gene family with many members exclusively from monocotyledonous plants (supplemental Fig. 2). No member of this gene family has yet been shown to be involved in heavy metal tolerance. The open reading frame of TaTM20 was 2,670 bp in length and encoded a hydrophobic polypeptide of 889 amino acids, which contained 20 putative transmembrane domains (colored in Fig. 2A). The topology of TaTM20 was predicted using a web-based program, the Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity scale of TopPred. Based on the predicted structure, the 20 transmembrane domains of TaTM20 had several interesting structural features, including a 5-fold tandem repeat units of four transmembrane domains each, and consensus motifs for protein kinase C phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). The five repeat units are highly homologous in nucleotide and amino acid sequence (Fig. 2C), suggesting that they arose by gene duplication events, followed by variation (31Shimizu T. Mitsuke H. Noto K. Arai M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The repeat units and the 5-fold structural symmetry of TaTM20 are similar to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), which has five symmetrical subunits that form a ring structure in the membrane around a central ion-conducting pore (32Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Unlike TaTM20, however, which encodes a single polypeptide with five symmetric units and 20 transmembrane domains, the subunits of the nicotinic AChR are encoded by different genes. Recent data from membrane protein crystal structures indicated that repeat units and structural symmetry play a major role in protein function (33Hunte C. Screpanti E. Venturi M. Rimon A. Padan E. Michel H. Nature. 2005; 435: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 34Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether all of the five tandem repeat units of TaTM20 were essential for its ability to confer Cd(II) tolerance. N- or C-terminal Deletion Mutants of TaTM20 Fail to Confer Cd(II) Tolerance to Yeast—We examined whether truncated TaTM20 were sufficient to confer Cd(II) tolerance, similar to full-length TaTM20. Several TaTM20 constructs were generated, in which one or more of the repeat units were deleted, abolishing the potential 5-fold symmetry of the protein (Fig. 2A, arrows, and Fig. 3A). To examine whether a single repeat unit was functional, we generated Δ721–2667, which expressed only the first repeating unit (the first four transmembrane domains of TaTM20). When we introduced this construct into Δycf1 cells and spotted colonies on medium supplemented with 40 μm CdCl2, we found that their growth was similar to EV-transformed Δycf1 cells. Both strains grew poorly compared with yeast expressing full-length TaTM20 (Fig. 3A). We next examined the function of several forms of TaTM20 that lacked one or more N- or C-terminal repeat units. We constructed Δ1–522 (one N-terminal repeat unit deleted), Δ2194–2667/Δ2464–2667 (one C-terminal repeat unit deleted), and Δ1429–2667/Δ1816–2667 (two consecutive C-terminal repeat units deleted), and we confirmed that each of these constructs was successfully transcribed in yeast by RT-PCR (Fig. 3B). However, none of the N- or C-terminal deletion constructs of TaTM20 conferred improved growth of Δycf1 cells (Fig. 3A). These results demonstrated that full-length TaTM20, which contains a complete set of the five repeat units, is essential for Cd(II) tolerance in yeast. Cadmium Content Is Specifically Reduced in TaTM20-transgenic Yeast—To determine the mechanism of Cd(II) tolerance by TaTM20 in yeast, we measured intracellular cadmium content in EV- and TaTM20-transformed Δycf1 cells cultured in liquid SG medium containing 20 μm CdCl2, using AAS. TaTM20-expressing yeast accumulated less cadmium than EV-transformed yeast (Fig. 4A). This result suggests that expression of TaTM20 enhances Cd(II) tolerance in yeast by decreasing intracellular cadmium content. To examine whether the reduction of cadmium content upon expression of TaTM20 was coupled to the regulation of essential metal ions, yeast strains were cultured in liquid SG medium without CdCl2 or supplemented with 20 μm CdCl2, and then calcium, copper, iron, potassium, magnesium, manganese, sodium, and zinc content, as well as cadmium content, were measured using inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy. With the exception of cadmium and regardless of the presence or absence of supplemented Cd(II), there was no significant difference in the ion content of any of the ions examined between TaTM20- and EV-expressing cells (supplemental Fig. 3). Therefore, the TaTM20-mediated decrease in cadmium content in yeast did not appear to be due to alterations in the homeostasis of other metal ions. TaTM20-expressing Cells Remove Cd(II) More Rapidly Than EV-transformed Cells—To understand the mechanism of TaTM20-induced reduction of cadmium content, we monitored time-dependent changes in Cd(II) content in Δycf1 cells using the radioactive isotope 109Cd(II). Yeast strains were cultured in liquid SG medium containing 109Cd(II), and 109Cd(II) activity in the cells was measured using a gamma counter. Two hours after the onset of 109Cd(II) uptake, it was apparent that TaTM20-expressing Δycf1 cells had accumulated less Cd(II) than the same strain of yeast transformed with EV. After 4 h of exposure to Cd(II), Cd(II) content in TaTM20-expressing Δycf1 cells was 80% that in EV-transformed cells (Fig. 4B). This result was consistent with the observed decrease in cadmium content in TaTM20-expressing cells measured using AAS (Fig. 4A). To determine whether TaTM20 enhanced Cd(II) efflux, we monitored the kinetics of Cd(II) efflux from the two strains of yeast. Cells were cultured in 109Cd(II)-containing liquid SG-medium for 1 h, washed, then transferred to SG medium without Cd(II), and 109Cd activity was monitored during the following 1 h. 109Cd activity decreased more rapidly in TaTM20-expressing Δycf1 cells compared with EV-transformed cells (Fig. 4C). Thirty minutes after the onset of the efflux phase, this difference was significant (p < 0.001). At this time point, TaTM20-expressing cells exported 37% of the total amount of Cd(II) loaded, whereas EV-transformed cells removed only 16%. Thus TaTM20 expression enhanced the export of Cd(II) out of cells, causing the decrease in Cd(II) content. TaTM20 Improves Cd(II) Tolerance of Δycf1 Cells under Reduced GSH Conditions—To investigate whether TaTM20-mediated Cd(II) efflux required GSH, we examined the growth of yeast on ½ SG plates containing Cd(II) and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). BSO effectively blocks the synthesis of GSH by inhibiting γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-ECS) in yeast cells and renders them sensitive to oxidative- or heavy metal-induced stress (35Mehdi K. Penninckx M.J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1885-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We spotted TaTM20 or EV transformants of Δycf1 together with WT-EV yeast as a control on plates containing 35 μm CdCl2 and/or 1.5 mm BSO. BSO alone did not alter the growth of the cells (Fig. 5A, 1st and 2nd panels). In medium containing 35 μm Cd(II), TaTM20-expressing yeast clearly showed improved growth compared with Δycf1 cells (Fig. 5A, 3rd panel). In medium containing BSO in addition to Cd(II), the growth of all three yeast strains was reduced further compared with growth on medium without BSO, possibly because of an increased sensitivity to Cd(II)-induced oxidative stress. However, even with GSH levels reduced by BSO, TaTM20-transgenic Δycf1 mutants still maintained a better tolerance to Cd(II) than EV-transformed Δycf1 or WT-EV cells (Fig. 5A, 4th panel). Under these conditions, GSH levels were reduced by BSO, as evidenced by the similar growth pattern of the two strains of yeast, Δycf1-EV and WT-EV, that differ in expression of YCF1, a GSH-dependent Cd(II) tolerance gene (Fig. 5A, 1st and 2nd lanes of the 4th panel). To quantify the GSH dependence of Cd(II) tolerance by TaTM20, we examined the growth of WT-EV, EV-transformed, and TaTM20-expressing Δycf1 mutant cells in liquid SG media in the absence and presence of BSO and Cd(II). 2 mm of BSO did not change the growth of the cells in SG medium, and the three strains grew similarly (Fig. 5B, top panel). When 35 μm Cd(II) was added to the medium without BSO, the three strains grew at different rates; WT-EV faster than Δycf1-EV, and TaTM20-expressing Δycf1 the fastest of all (Fig. 5B, middle panel). When Cd(II) was added to the medium in addition to BSO at a concentration of 35 μm (Fig. 5B, bottom panel) or 40 μm (data not shown), TaTM20-expressing Δycf1 mutants also grew better than the other two yeast strains, but the growth difference between WT-EV and Δycf1–EV cells (Fig. 5B, middle panel) was abolished (Fig. 5B, bottom panel). Thus, the mechanism of tolerance conferred by TaTM20 seems to differ from that of YCF1; YCF1-mediated Cd(II) tolerance depends directly on GSH but TaTM20-mediated Cd(II) tolerance depends on GSH to a lesser extent, possibly including a decrease in oxidative stress. Expression of TaTM20 Increases in Response to Cd(II) in Wheat Seedlings—To investigate whether TaTM20 functions in Cd(II) tolerance in wheat, we examined Cd(II)-induced changes in TaTM20 expression. Wheat seeds were germinated on ½ MS agar medium and grown for 7 days. They were transferred to ½ MS liquid medium for 12 h, and then exposed to ½ MS medium containing 100 μm CdCl2 for 6 h. The expression of TaTM20 was analyzed in shoots and roots by RT-PCR and quantified by real time RT-PCR. TaTM20 was expressed both in shoots and roots under control conditions, with higher expression levels in shoots than in roots (Fig. 6A). Treatment of seedlings with 100 μm CdCl2 resulted in an increase in TaTM20 expression, both in the shoots and roots (Fig. 6A). Transcript levels increased by Cd(II) more than 2- and 6-fold in the shoots and roots, respectively (Fig. 6B), suggesting a potential function of TaTM20 in the Cd(II) response in wheat. Cd(II)-pretreated Wheat Seedlings Accumulate Less Cd(II) in Roots—To obtain a clue to the in planta function of TaTM20 in relation to Cd(II) tolerance, we elevated the expression level of TaTM20 in wheat seedlings using Cd(II) pretreatment, and we then compare"
https://openalex.org/W2036122702,"U1-70K, a U1 snRNP-specific protein, and serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins are components of the spliceosome and play critical roles in both constitutive and alternative pre-mRNA splicing. However, the mobility properties of U1-70K, its in vivo interaction with SR proteins, and the mobility of the U1-70K-SR protein complex have not been studied in any system. Here, we studied the in vivo interaction of U1-70K with an SR protein (SR45) and the mobility of the U1-70K/SR protein complex using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Our results show that U1-70K exchanges between speckles and the nucleoplasmic pool very rapidly and that this exchange is sensitive to ongoing transcription and phosphorylation. BiFC analyses showed that U1-70K and SR45 interacted primarily in speckles and that this interaction is mediated by the RS1 or RS2 domain of SR45. FRAP analyses showed considerably slower recovery of the SR45/U1-70K complex than either protein alone indicating that SR45/U1-70K complexes remain in the speckles for a longer duration. Furthermore, FRAP analyses with SR45/U1-70K complex in the presence of inhibitors of phosphorylation did not reveal any significant change compared to control cells, suggesting that the mobility of the complex is not affected by the status of protein phosphorylation. These results indicate that U1-70K, like SR splicing factors, moves rapidly in the nucleus ensuring its availability at various sites of splicing. Furthermore, although it appears that U1-70K moves by diffusion its mobility is regulated by phosphorylation and transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1966640516,"Cavβ subunits support voltage gating of Cav1.2 calcium channels and play important role in excitation-contraction coupling. The common central membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) region of Cavβ binds to the α-interaction domain (AID) and the IQ motif of the pore-forming α1C subunit, but these two interactions do not explain why the cardiac Cavβ2 subunit splice variants differentially modulate inactivation of Ca2+ currents (ICa). Previously we described β2Δg, a functionally active splice variant of human Cavβ2 lacking MAGUK. By deletion analysis of β2Δg, we have now identified a 41-amino acid C-terminal essential determinant (β2CED) that stimulates ICa in the absence of Cavβ subunits and conveys a +20-mV shift in the peak of the ICa-voltage relationship. The β2CED is targeted by α1C to the plasma membrane, forms a complex with α1C but does not bind to AID. Electrophysiology and binding studies point to the calmodulin-interacting LA/IQ region in the α1C subunit C terminus as a functionally relevant β2CED binding site. The β2CED interacts with LA/IQ in a Ca2+- and calmodulin-independent manner and need LA, but not IQ, to activate the channel. Deletion/mutation analyses indicated that each of the three Cavβ2/α1C interactions is sufficient to support ICa. However, β2CED does not support Ca2+-dependent inactivation, suggesting that interactions of MAGUK with AID and IQ are crucial for Ca2+-induced inactivation. The β2CED is conserved only in Cavβ2 subunits. Thus, β2CED constitutes a previously unknown integrative part of the multifactorial mechanism of Cavβ2-subunit differential modulation of the Cav1.2 calcium channel that in β2Δg occurs without MAGUK.

Voltage-gated Cav1.2 calcium channels couple membrane depolarization to excitation in a wide variety of cells. The voltage gating, or membrane potential-dependent opening and closing of a channel, is associated with conformational changes in the pore-forming (α1) subunit (1Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar).

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar). How Cavβ subunits mediate these functions and what are the Cavβ-specific determinants are important questions to be answered. Members of the Cavβ family are structurally divergent. Four different Cavβ subunit genes code for β1–β4 subunit variants, some of which are alternatively spliced. Cytosolic Cavβ subunits bind to the 18-amino acid α1-interaction domain (AID) of the cytoplasmic linker between internal repeats I and II of the pore-forming α1 subunit (Fig. 1), stimulate the Ca2+ channel current (ICa), and shift the current-voltage (I-V) curve to more negative voltages (3García R.

Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). The AID is conserved between the Cav1 and Cav2 subfamilies of Ca + channels. It is located in close proximity to the transmembrane segment IS6 that is a part of the pore domain (5Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

A common central region of Cavβ subunits has structural similarity with the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) motif (8Hanlon M.R. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Wallace B.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). When co-expressed with the α1C subunit, the Cavβ MAGUK domain increased Ba2+ current (IBa) amplitude and shifted the steady-state activation (9Opatowsky Y. Chomsky-Hecht O. Kang M.-G. Campbell K.P. Hirsch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52323-52332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Confirming tight binding of the central Cavβ domain to the α1C subunit, diffraction studies revealed structural patterns that were implicated in interaction with the AID (10Chen Y.-h. Li M.-h.

Nature. 2004; 429: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). However, variant-specific regulatory properties of Cavβ appear to be AID-independent. Although different Cavβ subunits have MAGUK, they modulate Ca2+ channels with individual characteristic variations. For example, the primary cardiac β2a subunit did not fully substitute the β1a subunit in skeletal muscle EC coupling although it restored activation of ICa and gating of Ca2+ transients (13Beurg M. Sukhareva M. Ahern C.A. Conklin M.W. Perez-Reyes E. Powers P.A. Gregg R.G. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1744-1756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Unlike other Cavβ subunits, β2a endows the distinct cardiac phenotype by not supporting facilitation of the Ca2+ channel current by a depolarizing prepulse (14Cens T. Mangoni M.E. Richard S. Nargeot J. Charnet P. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 771-774PubMed Google Scholar). This general picture was further detailed by FRET microscopy combined with patch clamp that demonstrated differential voltage-dependent rearrangement of Cavβ subunits vis à vis the α1C subunit N terminus (15Kobrinsky E. Kepplinger K.J.F. Yu A. Harry J.B. Kahr H. Romanin C. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 844-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Unlike the Cavβ1a subunit, Cavβ2 exhibited no such mobility. These and other findings show that a number of Cavβ functions do not rely on AID as a main site of regulation and may involve other determinants (16Dolphin A.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 599-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 17Maltez J.M. Nunziato D.A. Kim J. Pitt G.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 372-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, identification of functional motifs that are unique for different Cavβ subunits may give an important insight into the functional specificity of the Cavβ-dependent modulation. One feasible approach is to explore the naturally occurring Cavβ splice variants (18Foell J.D. Balijepalli R.C. Delisle B.P. Yunker A.M.R. Robia S.L. Walker J.W. McEnery M.W. January C.T. Kamp T.J. Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 17: 183-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In line with this was the discovery of two new functionally active small splice variants of the human cardiac β2 subunit lacking the central domain (19Harry J.B. Kobrinsky E. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46367-46372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These β2f and β2Δg subunits share a 153-amino acid distal C-terminal region common to all known “large” Cavβ2 subunits (β2a–β2e) (20Colecraft H.M. Alseikhan B. Takahashi S.X. Chaudhuri D. Mittman S. Yegnasubramanian V. Alvania R.S. Johns D.C. Marban E. Yue D.T. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 541: 435-452Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar) suggesting that this region may have a role of an essential Cavβ2 determinant. Our attention to this region of the β2 subunit was stimulated by the finding that β2Δg supports ICa on co-expression with α1C and α2δ in Cavβ-free COS1 cells. Because large and small Cavβ2 splice variants convey sharply different inactivation kinetics, it seems apparent that, in addition to MAGUK, there is a C-terminal determinant (defined here as β2CED) that is common only to Cavβ2 subunits and thus may contribute to the Cavβ2-specific tuning of the channel modulation by large Cavβ2 subunits. In the case of the small Cavβ2 subunits, β2CED may play the key regulatory role. This intriguing possibility prompted us to locate β2CED and characterize the properties of β2CED-modulated Ca2+ channels that rely on β2CED-dependent, MAGUK-independent modulation. Molecular Biology, β2Δg Deletion Mutants—Cloning of β2g (AY675092), subcloning into the pcDNA3 vector, and the 5′-terminal fusion of ECFP have been described previously (19Harry J.B. Kobrinsky E. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46367-46372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To create ECFP-labeled β2Δg deletion mutants, the general strategy was to generate the deletion mutants by PCR and then replace the β2Δg open reading frame in 5′-ECFP-β2Δg-pcDNA3 with a deletion mutant at the 5′-XhoI/ApaI-3′ sites. The PCR were performed with β2Δg as template using the following primer pairs with 5′-XhoI linker (sense) and 3′-ApaI-TGA linker (antisense): 5′-cccgctcgagATGTATCTCTGGAGGAGGACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-gcgggcccTCAGTGGTCATGGGAATAATC-3′ (antisense) for β2Δg(1–82); 5′-gcctcgagGTGGACCACTATGCCTCAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-gggcgggcccTCAGTTGTGGTCCTGCTCTCGATC-3′ (antisense) for β2Δg(83–123); 5′-cggcggccgccaccATGGAGTGCAACAAGCAGCGCAGCCGTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-gggcgggcccTCATTGGCGGATGTAAACATG-3′ (antisense) for β2Δg(124–164). To create the deletion mutant 5′-ECFP-β2Δg(83–164)-pcDNA3, 5′-ECFP-β2Δg-pcDNA3 was cut by XhoI, filled-in to a blunt end, cleaved by PmlI, and then the 6.2-kb fragment was self-ligated. To generate the unlabeled β2Δg(124–165), a PCR product was amplified using the NotI linker/Kozak primer (sense) 5′-cggcggccgccaccATGGAGTGCAACAAGCAGCGCAGCCGTC-3′ and the ApaI primer/linker (antisense) 5′-gggcgggcccTCATTGGCGGATGTAAACATG-3′. The β2Δg(124–165) PCR product was subcloned into 5′-ECFP-β2Δg-pcDNA3 or β2Δg-pcDNA3 plasmid at the NotI/ApaI sites (replacing the β2Δg cassette). To create the mVenus-labeled deletion mutants, the 5′-BsrGI/ApaI-3′ inserts of the ECFP-labeled deletion mutants were subcloned into the mVenus-C1 vector (kindly provided by Dr. S. S. Vogel) cleaved at the same sites. 5′-ECFP-β2d-pcDNA3 was prepared by ligation of the 5′-PshAI/BsmBI-3′ fragment of β2b into the respective sites of plasmid 5′-ECFP-β2f-pcDNA3. The 5′-ECFP-β2dΔCED deletion construct in pcDNA3 was produced by substitution of 5′-ECFP-β2d-pcDNA3 at the BsmBI-AvrII sites with the respective fragment of β2Δg(83–123)-pcDNA3. The β2b cDNA was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from human heart mRNA with the sense 5′-ATGCTTGACAGACGCCTTATAG-3′ and antisense 5′-GCTGTTAGTTATACAAGACTTC-3′ primers as described earlier (19Harry J.B. Kobrinsky E. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46367-46372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). FLAGN-β2d and FLAGN-β2dΔCED in pcDNA3 were produced by ligating the 5′-BsrGI (filled in with Klenow)/AvrII-3′ fragments of pECFPN-β2d and pECFPN-β2dΔCED, respectively, into a FLAG-2AB-pcDNA3 vector (gift of Dr. Kuanghueih Chen) at the EcoRV and AvrII sites. To prepare mVenusN-β2d and mVenusN-β2dΔCED in pcDNA3, the 5′-BsrGI/AvrII (filled in with Klenow)-3′ fragments of 5′-ECFP-β2d-pcDNA3 and 5′-ECFP-β2dΔCED-pcDNA3, respectively, were ligated into the mVenus-C1 vector at the BsrGI and EcoRI (filled in with Klenow) sites. mVenusN-I-IIAID was constructed by PCR amplification of the 418–455 fragment of the α1C,77 I-II linker (nucleotides 1252–1365 of the pHLCC77 (z34815) open reading frame) in pcDNA3 followed by subcloning into the 5′-BspEI/EcoRI-3′ sites of the mVenus-C1 vector. The sense and antisense primers used were 5′-catatatccggaCGGGGAGATTTCCAGAAG-3′ and 5′-cggcatgaattctaGCCTTCGTCCTCATTC-3′, respectively. mVenusN-I-IIAIDM was created in the same way except that α1C,77AIDM was used as the template for PCR. BiotinN-I-IIAID in pcDNA6 was prepared with a Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen) and a pcDNA™ 6 BioEase Gateway Biotinylation System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions using α1C77-pcDNA3 as template, 5′-caccATGCGGGAGATTTCCAG-3′ and 5′-ctaGCCTTCGTCCTCATTCTC-3′ as sense and antisense primers, respectively. To prepare FLAGN-LA/IQ (amino acids 1571–1636 of α1C77) in pcDNA3 vector, PCR was performed with α1C77-pcDNA3 as template, 5′-gtattaaagcttAGGATCAAAACAGAAGGGAACCTAG-3′ and 5′-ctatatgggcccctaCTCTTTGCGCTTCTTGAACTTCC-3′ as sense and antisense primers, respectively; the PCR product was then subcloned into a FLAG-2AB-pcDNA3 vector at the HindIII/ApaI sites. FLAGN-α1C,77-pcDNA3 was created by replacement of the 5′-NdeI/HindIII-3′ fragment of α1C77-pcDNA3 with the respective fragment from FLAG-2AB-pcDNA3. The AID mutant α1C,77AIDM (D433A,G436A,Y437A,W440A) was generated by a “two-step” PCR site-directed mutagenesis. Briefly, two PCR fragments were produced with α1C,77-pcDNA3 as template and pairs of outer sense and mutagenesis antisense primers, and mutagenesis sense and outer antisense primers, respectively. The mutagenesis antisense and sense primers contained the desired mutated sequence and had 18 bases complementary to each other. The two fragments were fused together by denaturing, annealing, and Taq polymerase extension, the fused DNA product was then amplified by PCR with the outer primer pair. The outer sense and antisense primers were designed from the vector region 5′-ctatagggagacccaagcttc-3′ and α1C,77 open reading frame 5′-CACTTCCTTCTGCAGAACCG-3′ (1550 → 1531), respectively; the mutagenesis antisense and sense primers were 5′-ATCCAGGgcGgCTTTGAGAgCCTCTTCTAGCTGCTGCTT-3′ and 5′-CTCAAAGcCgcCCTGGATgcGATCACTCAGGCCGAAGAC-3′, respectively. The final PCR product was cleaved with HindIII and ClaI and substituted for the 5′-HindIII/ClaI-3′ fragment in α1C,77-pcDNA3 resulting in α1C,77AIDM-pcDNA3. To produce mVenusN-α1C,77AIDM-pcDNA3, the 5′-NdeI/KpnI-3′ fragment of α1C,77AIDM-pcDNA3 was replaced with the 5′-NdeI/KpnI-3′ fragment of vector pmVenus-C1, which contains the mVenus cDNA and is in a continuous reading frame with α1C,77AIDM-pcDNA3. 77ΔLK-pcDNA3 coding for α1C,77ΔLK was prepared by a similar mutagenesis strategy using pHLCC77 plasmid (21Soldatov N.M. Bouron A. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10540-10543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) as a template. The mutagenesis primers were 5′-CAGGGCCTTGTGGGCAAGCCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-gcccacaaggccctgCAGGGCCGTCCTGACCAGGGC-3′ (antisense); the outer primers were 5′-CTGTGATGCATGGAATACATTTGACGCCTTGATTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-ctagaactagtggatcctctaGAGTCGACCTGCAG-3′ (antisense). The final PCR product was cleaved with NsiI and XbaI, and then incorporated at the 5′-NsiI and 3′-XbaI sites into pHLCC77. Subsequently, the 5′-PpuMI/XbaI-3′ fragment of the resulting plasmid was ligated at the respective sites in α1C77-pcDNA3. For α1C,77AIDM/ΔLK-pcDNA3, the 5′-PpuMI/XbaI-3′ fragment of α1C,77ΔLK-pCDNA3 was subcloned into α1C,77AIDM-pcDNA3. All cDNA constructs were verified by nucleotide sequencing. Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were used for the IP analysis because of high expression efficiency. To exclude endogenous Cav1.2 subunits from the analysis, we expressed only tagged subunits and used antibodies against the tags. For IP-Western blot analysis, ≈80% confluent early passage HEK293 cells in 100-mm culture dishes were transfected with selected plasmids (for details, see figure legends) using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 72 h after transfection, cells were harvested and washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline. To improve the yield and stability of co-IP, cells were subjected to a standard cross-linking reaction (22Carlsson J. Drevin H. Axén R. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 723-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar, 23Xiang C.C. Mezey E. Chen M. Key S. Ma L. Brownstein M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e185Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) by incubation with the cell-permeant thiol-cleavable reagent dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (1 mm) (Pierce) at room temperature for 30 min. Cross-linking was stopped by incubation of cells with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for 15 min. Cells were lysed with a Cel-Lytic M lysis reagent (450 μl/plate, Sigma) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, 1/100 dilution) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. To ensure direct interaction, the microsomal fraction was used for co-IP experiments involving α1C. The 80-μl aliquots of total lysates were kept to verify the expression of each protein (see “input” on immunoblots). Co-IP was performed with the selected antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, co-IP with anti-FLAG antibody (Ab) was performed with 40 μl/reaction of a monoclonal EZ View™ ANTI-FLAG® M2 affinity gel (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight, and the immunoprecipitates were eluted by incubation with 10 μg of 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma) in 100 μl of TBS solution (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 1 h. The co-IP with anti-LC Ab was performed with 5 μl of a Living Colors Full-Length A.V. polyclonal Ab (Clontech) using Protein A-agarose (Sigma) as carrier (overnight at 4 °C), and the immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling for 5 min at 95 °C. Dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) was cleaved by incubation of the co-immunoprecipitate and input samples with 5% β-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 5 min or with 50 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 30 min (only for α1C) before SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies were performed according to standard protocols. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal Ab (2 μg/ml, Sigma) for the FLAG-tagged proteins, Living Colors Full-Length A.V. monoclonal Ab (0.5 μg/ml, Clontech) for the fluorescent tagged proteins, and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1/1000 dilution, Invitrogen) for the biotin-tagged proteins. Nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen) was used for immunoblot analysis of α1C co-IP experiments and polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen) was used for all other studies. Electrophysiology—The Effectene kit (Qiagen) was used for transfection of COS1 cells as described previously (15Kobrinsky E. Kepplinger K.J.F. Yu A. Harry J.B. Kahr H. Romanin C. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 844-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) under conditions optimized for a total amount of 0.2 μgof DNA per 35-mm Petri dish. Constructs were expressed in a 1:1 molar ratio. COS1 cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips (MatTek) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed as described (24Kobrinsky E. Tiwari S. Maltsev V.A. Harry J.B. Lakatta E. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12474-12485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) at 20–22 °C using the Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments) 48–72 h after transfection. The extracellular bath solution contained (in mm): 100 NaCl, 20 BaCl2 or CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Borosilicate glass pipettes (Kimax-51, Kimble Products) were fire-polished and showed a typical resistance of 3–6 megohms when filled with pipette solution containing (in mm): 110 CsCl, 5 MgATP, 10 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 20 tetraethylammonium, 0.2 cAMP, and 20 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with CsOH (15Kobrinsky E.

Voltage protocols were generated and data were digitized, recorded, and analyzed using pClamp 8.1 software (Axon Instruments). Test pulses were applied at 15-s intervals from the holding potential Vh =–90 mV. Currents were filtered at 1 kHz, sampled at 2.5–5 kHz, and corrected for leakage using an on-line P/4 subtraction protocol. At the end of experiments, channels were routinely tested for sensitivity of ICa to the inhibition by the dihydropyridine blocker PN200-110 (see examples). I-V curves were obtained by step depolarization to test potentials in the range of –60 to +90 mV (with 10-mV increments) applied from Vh. Steady-state inactivation curves were measured with conditioning pulses (1 s) applied from Vh =–90 mV up to –60 to +40 mV with 10-mV increments followed by a 100-ms test pulse. Peak current amplitudes were normalized to the maximal value. Averaged I-V curves were fit with the equation: I = Gmax (V – Erev)/(1 + exp[(V – V0.5,act)/kI-V]), where Gmax is maximum conductance, Erev is reversal potential, V0.5,act the voltage at 50% of the current (I) activation, and kI-V the slope factor. Steady-state inactivation curves were fitted by a Boltzmann function: I = a + b·(1 + exp[(V – V0.5,in)/ki]), where V is the conditioning pulse voltage; V0.5,in is the voltage at half-maximum of inactivation, ki is a slope factor, a and b are fractions of noninactivating and inactivating components of the current, respectively. To estimate the time constant τ of inactivation, currents were fitted with the Chebyshev method according to the standard exponential function, I(t)=∑i=1nIie-t/τi+I0 where Ii is the amplitude of the inactivating component of the current, τ is the time constant of inactivation, and I0 is the non-inactivating component of the current. Statistical values are given as mean ± S.E. Error bars in the figures are S.E., n, number of tested cells. Differences were considered significant if Student's t test showed p < 0.05. Imaging—Cell images were recorded with a 14-bit Hamamatsu digital camera C9100-12 mounted on the Nikon epifluorescent microscope TE200 (60 × 1.2 N.A. objective) equipped with multiple filter sets (Chroma Technology, Rockingham, VT). Excitation light was delivered by a 175-watt Xenon lamp. Images were obtained and analyzed using C-Imaging software program (Compix, Sewickley, PA). Selection of Appropriate Expression System—Electrophysiological studies of Ca2+ channels are traditionally based on the use of HEK293 cells. However, several independent careful evaluations have shown that these cells contain endogenous Ca2+ channel subunits and exhibit ICa at a level of 1–3 pA/pF (25Berjukow S. Döring F. Froschmayr M. Grabner M. Glossmann H. Hering S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 748-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 26Kurejova M. Uhrik B. Sulova Z. Sedlakova B. Krizanova O. Lacinova L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 567: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, HEK293 cells can be used safely for the functional analysis of recombinant Ca2+ channels only when the amplitude of the current is large enough to ignore the contribution of the endogenous channels. To avoid this problem, in this study we used COS1 cells because they lack endogenous Cav1.2 subunits (27Meir A. Bell D.C. Stephens G.J. Page K.M. Dolphin A.C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 731-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar): (a) Western blot analysis with anti-α1C Ab revealed no detectable endogenous α1C in non-transfected COS1 cells (Fig. 2A, lane 1), and (b) no Ca2+ channel activity was observed in COS1 cells expressing recombinant α1C and α2δ subunits (Fig. 2B) in contrast to cells that were co-transfected with β2d, β2Δg, or β2CED (see below). This experiment unambiguously shows that Cav1.2 calcium channels are silent in the absence of Cavβ and that activity of the Ca2+ channel demonstrated in HEK293 cells in the absence of exogenous Cavβ subunits may be due to endogenous channels. The absence of the functional Cavβ subunits in COS1 cells that follows from the data in Fig. 2B was further confirmed by co-IP analysis with recombinant FLAGN-α1C/α2δ that revealed a lack of detectable endogenous monkey β1, β2, β3, and β4 subunits in COS1 cells (28Ravindran, A., Lao, Q. Z., Harry, J. B., Abrahimi, P., Kobrinsky, E., and Soldatov, N. M. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., in pressGoogle Scholar). Kinetics parameters and voltage dependence of activation and inactivation of ICa and IBa through the α1C,77/α2δ/β1a channel measured in COS1 cells were consistent with data obtained in other expression systems (15Kobrinsky E. Kepplinger K.J.F. Yu A. Harry J.B. Kahr H. Romanin C. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 844-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). An important advantage of COS1 cells is their relatively slow division rate that allows for better control over efficiency of expression and assembly of the Cav1.2 channel subunits of different size. However, HEK293 cells were more appropriate for co-IP-Western blot analysis of the recombinant tagged channel proteins in our study because they provide higher efficiency of expression, whereas endogenous subunits were undetectable with streptavidin and Abs to FLAG and Venus (ECFP) tags by Western blot analysis and fluorescence microscopy. Localization of β2CED by Deletion Analysis of the β2Δg Subunit—To locate β2CED, we constructed the following β2Δg fragments: 1–82, 83–164, 83–123, and 124–164 (Fig. 3, A–E, panels a). To ease IP and detection, β2Δg fragments were tagged at the N termini with the monomeric mVenus protein (29Koushik S.V. Chen H. Thaler C. Puhl III, H.L. Vogel S.S. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: L99-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) or ECFP. As with other Cavβ subunits (e.g. β1a, β2a (15Kobrinsky E. Kepplinger K.J.F. Yu A. Harry J.B. Kahr H. Romanin C. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 844-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), β2f or β2Δg (19Harry J.B. Kobrinsky E. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46367-46372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)), fusion of ECFP and mVenus to the N termini of the β2Δg fragments did not markedly change electrophysiological properties of the expressed channels (e.g. β2d(124–164) in Fig. 2C). The ECFPN-labeled β2Δg fragments were co-expressed with the α1C,77 and α2δ subunits in COS1 cells. The relative tendency of the ECFPN-β2Δg deletion mutants to accumulate in PM can be seen in close juxtaposition from distribution of ECFP fluorescence in the expressing cells (Fig. 3, A–E, panels b and c). Ability of the β2Δg deletion mutants to support ICa was assayed by patch clamp (Fig. 3, A–E, panels d). Binding to α1C was assayed by co-IP of the mVenusN-labeled β2Δg fragments with FLAGN-α1C,77/α2δ (Fig. 3F). Confirming previous observations (19Harry J.B. Kobrinsky E. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46367-46372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), when co-expressed with α1C,77 and α2δ subunits, β2Δg was appreciably accumulated in PM (Fig. 3A, panels b and c),"

We show that purified milk OPN is a substrate for thrombin with a kcat/Km value of 1.14 × 105 m–1 s–1. Thrombin cleavage of OPN was inhibited by unsulfated hirugen (IC50 = 1.2 ± 0.2 μm), unfractionated heparin (IC50 = 56.6 ± 8.4 μg/ml) and low molecular weight (5 kDa) heparin (IC50 = 31.0 ± 7.9 μg/ml), indicating the involvement of both anion-binding exosite I (ABE-I) and anion-binding exosite II (ABE-II). Using a thrombin mutant library, we mapped residues important for recognition and cleavage of OPN within ABE-I and ABE-II. A peptide (OPN-(162–197)) was designed spanning the OPN thrombin cleavage site and a hirudin-like C-terminal tail domain. Thrombin cleaved OPN-(162–197) with a specificity constant of kcat/Km = 1.64 × 104 m–1 s–1. Representative ABE-I mutants (K65A, H66A, R68A, Y71A, and R73A) showed greatly impaired cleavage, whereas the ABE-II mutants were unaffected, suggesting that ABE-I interacts principally with the hirudin-like OPN domain C-terminal and contiguous to the thrombin cleavage site. Debye-Hückel slopes for milk OPN (–4.1 ± 1.0) and OPN-(162–197) (–2.4 ± 0.2) suggest that electrostatic interactions play an important role in thrombin recognition and cleavage of OPN. Thus, OPN is a bona fide substrate for thrombin, and generation of thrombin-cleaved OPN with enhanced pro-inflammatory properties provides another molecular link between coagulation and inflammation.

OPN is normally expressed by osteoblasts, osteoclasts, epithelium, and smooth muscle cells. Many inflammatory cells (T cells, macrophages, NK cells, and Kupfer cells) also express OPN, which can be enhanced in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, tissue injury, and stress (1Denhardt D.T.

Melanoma cells and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells will only bind thrombin-cleaved OPN, suggesting that thrombin cleavage is critical in the pathology of certain cancers (13Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A.

Thrombin cleavage of human OPN (Arg168–Ser169) exposes a cryptic integrin binding motif, 162SVVYGLR168, that specifically binds integrins α4β1, α4β7, and α9β1 (16Barry S.T. Ludbrook S.B. Murison E.

Cell adhesion can be inhibited by alanine substitution of Tyr165 or by the double deletion of Leu167/Arg168 in the SVVYGLR motif.

As thrombin and OPN are both present at sites of tissue injury and inflammation, thrombin cleavage of OPN has been postulated to be important in enhancing the pro-inflammatory effect of OPN in vivo. However, although thrombin cleavage of OPN appears to be important in regulating its biological role, its biochemistry has not been studied in detail. This paper establishes OPN as a bona fide substrate of thrombin and defines the domains in that are thrombin important for its recognition and hydrolysis. Materials—Human wild-type (WT) and alanine-substituted mutant thrombins were expressed, purified, and titrated with PPACK (d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone) as described previously (20Tsiang M. Paborsky L.R. Li W.X. Jain A.K. Mao C.T. Dunn K.E. Lee O.W. Matsumura S.Y. Matteucci M.D. Coutré S.E. Leung L.L. Gibbs C.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16449-16457Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Low molecular weight (LMW) heparin (5 kDa), porcine intestinal mucosal unfractionated heparin, PPACK, and unsulfated hirulog were from Sigma. The peptides SVVYGLR and OPN-(162–197) (SVVYGLR/SKSKKFQRPDIQYPDATDEDITSHMESEE) were synthesized, purified, and quantitated by the peptide synthesis facility at Stanford University School of Medicine. Purification of Human OPN from Milk—OPN was purified from human milk (Mothers Milk Bank, San Jose, CA) using a previously published procedure with modifications (21Bayless K.J. Davis G.E. Meininger G.A. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 liter of human milk pooled from several donors was allowed to separate on ice. The whey was carefully decanted from the curd and clarified by centrifugation at 23,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C and then clarified further over a 0.2-μm pore size filtration unit. Benzamidine (2 mm) and DTT (2 mm) were added, and the clarified whey fraction was batch-adsorbed to Q-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 4°C. The resin was washed with 10 mm sodium phosphate/0.2 m NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm benzamidine, pH 7.4, and then eluted with 10 mm sodium phosphate/1.0 m NaCl, 2 mm DTT, pH 7.4. The eluant was dialyzed overnight in 10 mm sodium phosphate/4 m NaCl, 2 mm DTT, pH 7.4. The dialyzed protein was then loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap phenyl-Sepharose HP column (GE Healthcare) at 1 ml/min and washed to base line. A linear gradient was developed from 4 to 1 m NaCl at 1 ml/min with 1-ml fractions collected. Pure fractions were pooled and dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Partially pure fractions were diluted in 10 mm sodium phosphate/4 m NaCl, 2 mm DTT, pH 7.4, and reapplied over the HiTrap phenyl-Sepharose HP column. The concentration of purified protein was estimated at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient (1 cm path length) of 22920. Hydrolysis of Human Milk OPN by Thrombin and the Quantitation of the Cleaved C-terminal Fragment—OPN (4–31 μm) was reacted with thrombin (≈5–100 nm) in assay buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.5, and at various salt concentrations (≈20–200 mm NaCl) at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated with the addition of PPACK (5 μm) followed by DTT (5 mm). HPLC-gel filtration chromatography (HPLC-GFC) was employed to quantitate the generation of the 15-kDa C-terminal fragment (CTF) liberated by thrombin cleavage. Various amounts (10–40 μl) of the reaction mixture were injected over a Shodex 8 × 300 mm KW-803 column (Showa Denko America Inc, New York), and proteins were resolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, pH 7.6, at 1 ml/min. The peak area was detected at 254 nm and was converted to nmoles of product using a calibration curve. Inhibition of Thrombin Hydrolysis of Human Milk OPN or OPN-(162–197) Peptide by LMW Heparin, Unfractionated Heparin, and Unsulfated Hirulog—Human milk OPN (5 μm) or OPN-(162–197) (10 μm) was preincubated with 5 kDa of LMW heparin, porcine intestinal unfractionated heparin (0.25–1000 μg/ml), or unsulfated hirugen (10 nm–10 μm) at 37°C for 10 min. Thrombin was added to milk OPN (50 nm) and OPN-(162–197) (100 nm) and incubated for 3 and 5 min, respectively, at 37 °C. Reactions containing human milk OPN were terminated with 5 μm PPACK followed by 5 mm DTT. Thrombin hydrolysis of OPN-(162–197) was terminated by the addition of 10% perchloric acid. The concentration of thrombin used and the incubation time were determined empirically to give no more than 30% substrate hydrolysis. The amount of product formed was determined by HPLC-GFC for human milk OPN and reverse-phase HPLC for OPN-(162–197). Determination of the Michaelis-Menten Parameters for Thrombin Hydrolysis of Milk OPN—Several concentrations of OPN (4–31 μm) were digested with thrombin (typically 5 nm) at 37 °C for various times, such that there was less than 10% hydrolysis of substrate. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μm PPACK and 5 mm DTT. The amount of product formed (OPN CTF) was determined by HPLC-GFC as described above. The values for Km and kcat were determined by plotting the initial velocity of cleavage against the different substrate concentrations and then fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression analysis. Experiments were performed in duplicate, and the data were pooled for analysis. Estimation of kcat/Km for Cleavage of OPN under First Order Rate Conditions—Values for kcat/Km were determined by full reaction progress curves at a substrate concentration well below Km for WT and representative mutants of thrombin within anion-binding exosite I (ABE-I; R20A, K21A, Q24A, R62A, K65A, H66A, R68A, T69A, R70A, Y71A, R73A, K77A, K106A, K107A), ABE-II (R89A/R93A/E94A, R98A, D122A/R123A/E124A, E169A/K174A/D175A, R178A/R180A/D183A, R245A, K248A), the 50-insertion loop (W50A), and the Na+ binding site (E229A). 5 μm OPN (0.26 × [Km]) was preincubated in assay buffer for 10 min at 37 °C. Reactions were started with the addition of thrombin (typically 50 nm) and incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots were removed at several time points (0–1800 s) and terminated with 5 μm PPACK followed by 5 mm DTT. The amount of product generated (nmoles) for each time point was determined by HPLC-GFC as detailed above. Values for kcat/Km were determined by fitting data from the time course experiments to the following equation (22Philippou H. Rance J. Myles T. Hall S.W. Ariens R.A. Grant P.J. Leung L.L. Lane D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32020-32026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), kcat/KM=−ln(1−{[CTF]/[CTFf]}/[ET]×t(Eq. 1) where [CTF] is the concentration of the CTF at a given time, CTFf is the concentration of the CTF at full activation, and [ET] is the total enzyme concentration of thrombin at any given time (t). Curve fitting was performed using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software). Determination of Km, kcat, and kcat/Km for Hydrolysis of the Peptide OPN-(162–197)—For the estimation of Michaelis-Menten parameters, 10–300 μm OPN-(162–197) peptide was incubated with WT or mutant thrombin in assay buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.5. Enzyme concentration and incubation time were varied such that there was less than 10% substrate depletion. Reactions were terminated with the addition of 10% perchloric acid. The cleaved and uncleaved peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a Waters Symmetry C18 (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm) column using a 0.2–35% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid gradient over 30 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Cleavage was specific with no secondary cleavage sites. The cleaved peptide peak OPN-(162–168) (SVVYGLR) eluted at 19.8 min and was well resolved from OPN-(162–197) (23.6 min) and the OPN-(169–197) cleavage product (22.3 min). Identity of the cleavage products was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The area under the SVVYGLR peak was converted to nmoles of peptide using a calibration curve constructed with purified and quantitated SVVYGLR peptide. The values for Km and kcat were determined by fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation by non-linear regression analysis as described above. The deduced value for Km was used to determine the reaction conditions for estimating the specificity constant, kcat/Km. OPN-(162–197) peptide (10 μm, 0.04 × Km) was preincubated in assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.5) for 10 min. Reactions were started with the addition of WT or mutant thrombin (100–500 nm) with aliquots removed at several time points (0–1800 s) and then terminated with the addition of 10% perchloric acid. The effect of NaCl and choline chloride (ChCl) on kcat/Km was determined in the presence of assay buffer with salt concentrations ranging from 20 to 200 mm. Assays with ChCl were buffered with 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to reduce Na+ ions from pH adjustment. The amount of product (SVVYGLR) formed was quantitated as described above by reverse-phase HPLC analysis, and the values for kcat/Km were determined as described above. Determination of the Kinetic Parameters for Hydrolysis of Purified Human Breast Milk OPN by Thrombin—The hydrolysis of human milk derived OPN by thrombin gave estimates for Km (19.1 ± 3.9 μm), kcat (0.9 ± 0.1 s–1), and kcat/Km (0.47 × 105 m–1 s–1) under assay conditions looking at initial reaction velocities over several substrate concentrations up to 31 μm (Fig. 1A). However, significant substrate and/or product inhibition was observed at concentrations of 50 μm and higher (data not shown). To account for substrate/product inhibition effects, we estimated a value for the specificity constant kcat/Km of (1.14 ± 0.17) × 105 m–1 s–1 (Fig. 1B) by full reaction progress curves using a substrate concentration estimated to be 0.26 × Km. Under these conditions the estimate for kcat/Km is ∼2.5 times better and most likely reflects the best estimate for the specificity constant. Unfractionated Heparin, LMW Heparin, and Unsulfated Hirugen Inhibit Thrombin Hydrolysis of OPN—Osteopontin contains two putative heparin-binding domains (23Kazanecki C.C. Uzwiak D.J. Denhardt D.T. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 102: 912-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), therefore we hypothesized that heparin could act as a bridge between the heparin-binding domains and the thrombin ABE-II domain, enhancing hydrolysis. OPN can be bound to HiTrap heparin-Sepharose and eluted with 0.37 m NaCl, suggesting the presence of OPN heparin-binding domains (data not shown). However, we found that LMW heparin and unfractionated heparin caused dose-dependent inhibition of thrombin hydrolysis of OPN with IC50 values of 31.0 ± 7.9 and 56.6 ± 8.4 μg/ml, respectively (Fig. 2A). Further, the inhibition curves were not bell-shaped, suggesting that heparin does not function as a macromolecular bridge binding both thrombin and OPN to enhance thrombin cleavage of OPN. Rather, both unfractionated and LMW heparins compete against OPN for binding to the thrombin ABE-II, indicating the importance of ABE-II in thrombin cleavage of OPN. Unsulfated hirugen is a tight binding inhibitor specific only for thrombin ABE-I. Hirugen also caused dose-dependent inhibition of thrombin cleavage of OPN with an IC50 of 1.2 ± 0.2 μm (Fig. 2B). The inhibition studies using LMH heparin and hirugen suggest that both exosites play a role in thrombin cleavage of OPN. Mapping of Residues in ABE-I and ABE-II Important for the Hydrolysis of OPN—A bank of more than 56 mutant thrombins has been used to map domains important in the cleavage of FV (24Myles T. Yun T.H.

These studies have identified key residues within ABE-I and ABE-II important in defining the interaction interface for all these interactions.

Ten thrombin ABE-I mutants had less than 50% WT activity, with mutants K65A (29%), H66A (14%), Y71A (16%), and R73A (20%) severely affected (Table 1), which indicates a very large interaction interface within ABE-I. Three mutants in ABE-II (total of seven alanine-substituted residues) have impaired activity relative to WT thrombin, R98A (41%), R89A/R93A/E94A (31%), and R178A/R180A/D1778A (46%), confirming the role of this ABE from the heparin inhibition studies. The mutant thrombins W50A and E229A were also assessed for their ability to hydrolyze OPN. Trp50 forms part of the 50-insertion loop and is important in defining the insertion loop and the aryl binding site, and Glu229 maintains the integrity of the Na+-binding loop. The crystal structure of E229A shows the collapse of the active site with almost complete occlusion (32Carter W.J. Myles T. Gibbs C.S. Leung L.L. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26387-26394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Alanine substitution of both of these residues has a profound effect in the ability of thrombin to hydrolyze OPN, both with 9% WT activity. These mutations clearly show that a functional thrombin active site is needed to cleave at the P1 arginine of SVVYGLR/SKSKKFQ.TABLE 1Impaired hydrolysis of OPN by selected alanine substituted thrombin mutants from ABE-I, ABE-II, and the active siteThrombinaThrombin-based numbering.ChymotrypsinbChymotrypsinogen-based numbering.Locationkcat/Km × 104WT activitym-1s-1%WTWT11.36 ± 1.72100R20AR35AABE-I14.22 ± 1.18125K21AK36A3.56 ± 0.0731Q24AQ38A10.42 ± 1.2592R62AR67A4.65 ± 0.2841K65AK70A3.31 ± 0.2029H66AH71A1.58 ± 0.1914R68AR73A3.80 ± 0.4934T69AT74A7.90 ± 0.9570R70AR75A4.65 ± 0.5141Y71AY76A1.84 ± 0.1716R73AR77AA2.31 ± 0.1520K77AK81A4.73 ± 0.3842K106AK109A6.25 ± 0.2555K107AK110A5.10 ± 0.3645R89A/R93A/E94AR93A/R97A/E97AAABE-II3.10 ± 0.1931R98AR101A4.69 ± 0.2841D122A/R123A/E124AD125A/R126A/E127A7.60 ± 0.3867E169A/K174A/D175AE164A/K169A/D170A7.02 ± 0.4262R178A/R180A/D183AR173A/R175A/D178A5.24 ± 0.4746R245AR233A7.28 ± 0.4464K248AK236A7.24 ± 0.2964W50AW60DAActive site0.96 ± 0.148E229AE217A1.02 ± 0.149a Thrombin-based numbering.b Chymotrypsinogen-based numbering. Open table in a new tab Identification of an OPN Domain That Interacts with ABE-I—OPN has a hirudin-like domain, DIQYPDATDEDITSHMESEE (33Rydel T.J. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 583-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), adjacent and contiguous to the thrombin cleavage site, that could potentially interact with ABE-I. To address this potential interaction, a peptide was made (OPN-(162–197)) that spanned the cleavage site and hirudin-like ABE-I-binding domain. Values for Km (296.6 ± 10.9 μm), kcat (3.3 ± 0.1 s–1), and kcat/Km (1.11 × 104 m–1 s–1) were initially determined over a range of substrate concentrations; the value derived for Km was used to define experimental conditions to estimate kcat/Km under first order rate conditions (Fig. 3). The specificity constant kcat/Km was determined for the cleavage of this OPN-(162–197) by WT thrombin and was found not to be a good substrate (kcat/Km 1.64 ± 0.06 × 104 m–1 s–1) when compared with milk OPN (kcat/Km 1.14 ± 0.17 × 105 m–1 s–1). Hirugen was found to inhibit thrombin cleavage of OPN-(162–197) (Fig. 2B) with an IC50 = 1.1 ± 0.1 μm showing a requirement for ABE-I. The ability of selected ABE-I and ABE-II mutants to cleave OPN-(162–197) was compared with that of WT thrombin (Table 2). The ABE mutants K65A, H66A, R68A, Y71A, and R73A in general showed similar decreases in activity relative to WT thrombin when compared with the cleavage of milk OPN. Heparin had no effect, excluding the participation of ABE-II (Fig. 2A). Consistent with this finding, ABE-II mutants R98A, E160A/K174A/D175A, and R178A/R180A/D183A in general had no effect on cleavage of the peptide, suggesting that the OPN hirudin-like domain interacts principally with the thrombin ABE-I. The ABE-II R89A/R93A/E94A mutant showed 44% WT activity. The residue Glu94 lies on the rim between ABE-II and the active site, so it is conceivable that mutation of this residue could influence cleavage within the active site.TABLE 2ABE-I alanine-substituted thrombin mutants have impaired catalysis for the OPN-(162–197) peptideThrombinLocationkcat/KmWT activitymm-1s-1%WT16.35 ± 0.58100K65AABE-I5.38 ± 1.2533H66A2.87 ± 0.4118R68A5.80 ± 0.3235Y71A3.76 ± 0.0123R73A7.41 ± 0.1945R89A/R93A/E94AABE-II7.13 ± 0.4044R98A15.10 ± 0.8392E169A/K174A/D175A14.79 ± 1.2390R178A/R180A/D183A16.33 ± 0.35100 Open table in a new tab Electrostatic Interactions Are Important for Hydrolysis of OPN by Thrombin—Studies between thrombin and hirudin show the importance of complementary electrostatic fields in enhancing the rate of complex formation by “electrostatic steering” (34Wade R.C.

Here we show that that the tip of this finger is important for two transcription initiation functions. First, TFIIB acts as a catalytic cofactor for initial RNA bond formation. It does so via a pair of fingertip aspartates that can bind magnesium, placing TFIIB within a family of proteins that insert finger domains to alter the catalytic functions of RNA polymerase. Second, the TFIIB fingertip mediates the timing of the release of TFIIB that is associated with appropriate promoter escape. These initiation requirements may assist in RNA quality control by minimizing functional synthesis when RNA polymerase becomes inappropriately associated with the genome without having been recruited there by TFIIB."

In a broader context of developing high sensitivity mass spectrometry methodologies for glycomic identification of Lea versus Lex and linear versus branched poly-N-acetyllactosamine (polyLacNAc), we have now shown that the dimeric type 1 glycan chain, as carried on the lactosylceramides of a human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line, Colo205, not only can be further extended linearly but can likewise be branched at C6 of 3-linked Gal in a manner similar to polyLacNAc. A combination of chemical and enzymatic derivatization coupled with advanced mass spectrometry analyses afforded unambiguous identification of a complex mixture of type 1 and 2 hybrids as well as those fucosylated variants founded exclusively on linear and branched trimeric type 1 chain. We further showed by in vitro enzymatic synthesis that extended type 1 and the hybrid chains can be branched by all three forms of the human I branching enzymes (IGnT) currently identified but with lower efficiency and stringency with respect to branching site preference. Importantly, it was found that a better substrate is one that carries a Gal site for branching that is extended at the non-reducing end by a type 2 and not a type 1 unit, whereas the IGnTs are less discriminative with respect to whether the targeted Gal site is itself β3- or β4-linked to GlcNAc at the reducing end.

Type 1 (Galβ1–3GlcNAc) and type 2 (Galβ1–4GlcNAc) glycan chains represent the two most common peripheral backbone sequences extending from the core structures of mammalian glycoconjugates to which linkage-specific additions of terminal fucose, sialic acid, and other glycosyl residues give rise to a variety of commonly found bioactive epitopes.

Among the first reported incidences of extended type 1 chains are those constituting the lacto series glycosphingolipids (GSL) of human meconium, which could be extended by one or two additional type 2 disaccharide units with varying degrees of fucosylation (7Karlsson K.A. Larson G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3512-3524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A decade later, in the early 90s, fucosylated dimeric type 1 chains on lactosylceramides were identified as tumor-associated antigens in the form of Leb-Lea and Lea-Lea (8Stroud M.R. Levery S.B. Nudelman E.D. Salyan M.E. Towell J.A. Roberts C.E. Watanabe M. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8439-8446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Stroud M.R. Levery S.B. Salyan M.E.

The colonic adenocarcinoma cell line, Colo205, was thought to exhibit such unusual glyco-phenotypes due to its abnormally high β3-galactosyltransferase (β3GalT) activities (10Holmes E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 630-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Isshiki S. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Watanabe M. Kubota T. Kitajima M. Shiraishi N. Sasaki K. Andoh T. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12499-12507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) coupled with possibly a novel or up-regulated β3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (β3GnT) activity (12Holmes E.H. Hakomori S. Ostrander G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15649-15658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, another rare occurrence of extended type 1 chain was reported for the GSLs isolated from the small intestine of an individual who is of blood group O, Le(a-b-) nonsecretor status (13Angstrom J. Larsson T. Hansson G.C. Karlsson K.A. Henry S. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Non-fucosylated dimeric type 1 chain on lactosylceramide was found to carry an additional fucosylated type 2 branch. This suggests that although the fucosylated dimeric type 1 chain, Leb/a-Lea, may be truly tumor-associated, type 1 chain extension itself, either with another type 1 or type 2 unit, may have a wider occurrence on normal human tissues. It can be associated with a particular genetic background, developmental stage, or activation process whereby glycosyltransferases normally responsible for capping off type 1 chains are down-regulated coupled with elevated basal activities of β3GnT and β3GalT. A true evaluation of the occurrence and functions of extended type 1 chain is nonetheless difficult, largely hindered by a lack of sensitive detection methods either by analytical chemistry approach or biological probes such as monoclonal antibodies with strict specificity. However, recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS) analysis have opened up new possibilities in revisiting these issues. In particular, efficient MALDI-MS/MS utilizing both low and high energy collision induced dissociation (CID) is now possible at sufficiently high sensitivity to allow meaningful analysis of real biological samples (14Yu S.Y. Wu S.W. Khoo K.H. Glycoconj. J. 2006; 23: 355-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Using the well characterized GSLs from Colo205 and the glycans derived thereof, we aimed to develop a facile MS/MS sequencing method to critically map the various possible combination of extended and branched type 1 and type 2 glycan chains. We now show that further extension or branching of dimeric type 1 chain carried on the lactosylceramides of Colo205 is possible. MS/MS fragmentation pattern was established from previous and this work, in which the signal assignment was validated by comparative analysis of authentic standards synthesized in vitro by enzymes. We further demonstrate that the human I branching β6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (IGnT) is capable of transferring a GlcNAc onto the branch point of an extended type 1 chain albeit with significantly lower efficiency. Interestingly, by testing against all four possible combination of dimeric type 1 and type 2 chains as acceptors, we show that branching is significantly more efficient if a terminal type 2 and not type 1 unit is at the non-reducing terminus of the Gal and less dependent on whether the Gal itself is β3- or β4-linked to GlcNAc at the reducing end. Extraction and Fractionation of GSLs—The Colo205 cells (ATCC no. CCL-222) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in a 5-liter spinner. GSLs were extracted from harvested cells by 15 volumes of 55:25:20 (v:v:v) isopropanol:hexane:water and then subjected to a Folch partition in 4:2:1 (v:v:v) chloroform:methanol:water (8Stroud M.R. Levery S.B. Nudelman E.D. Salyan M.E. Towell J.A. Roberts C.E. Watanabe M. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8439-8446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Folch upper layer containing the GSLs were dried and re-dissolved in 30:60:8 (v:v:v) chloroform:methanol:water for loading onto a DEAE column. Neutral GSLs were washed through and collected in 3 volumes of 30:60:8 (v:v:v) chloroform:methanol:water. Size fractionation of the neutral GSLs was performed on a silica gel column (1.6 × 5 cm) packed with Iatrobeads 6RS-8060 (Iatron Laboratories Inc). The column was pre-equilibrated with 55:40:5 (v:v:v) isopropanol:hexane:water and stepwise eluted with decreasing ratios of 55:40:5 (v:v:v) to 55:20:25 (v:v:v) of isopropanol:hexane:water. HPTLC of GSLs and Immunostaining—Neutral GSLs were spotted on HPTLC plate (silica gel 60 F254, Merck) and developed with a mobile phase containing chloroform:methanol:water in a ratio of 50:40:10 (v:v:v). GSLs were stained by spraying 0.2% orcinol (Sigma) in 10% H2SO4 and incubated for 10 min at 110 °C in oven. For immunostaining, the HPTLC plate was first fixed with 0.5% polyisobutylmethacrylate (GlycoTech, Gaithersburg, MD) in chloroform:hexane, 1:9 (v: v), for 30 s followed by blocking for 10 min in 3% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline. The plates were then washed by phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with primary antibodies CF4C4 (anti-Lea) and SH1 (anti-Lex) (both kindly provided by GlycoNex Inc., Taiwan) at room temperature for 1 h followed by biotinylated secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. The plate was then further incubated with an avidinbiotin complex kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at room temperature for 30 min to amplify signals from secondary antibody, followed by development with Immunostaining HRP-1000 kit (Konica Minolta). Enzymatic Release, Digest, and Synthesis of Glycans—The glycan moiety of GSL was released from the ceramide core by digestion with 5 milliunits of ceramide glycanase (Calbiochem, catalog no. 219484) in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, containing 0.1% sodium cholate at 37 °C overnight. The released glycans were separated from the ceramide, salt, and detergents by passing through a Supelclean Envi-carb SPE tube (Supelco) preconditioned in the sequential order of 1 n NaOH, water, 30% acetic acid, water, 75% acetonitrile + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and water. After extensive washing with water, the glycan sample was eluted with 3 ml of 25% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The released glycans were first defucosylated by 48% aqueous hydrofluoric acid at 0 °C in the dark for 48 h before glycosidase digestions. β-1–3-Galactosidase (10 milliunits, from recombinant Escherichia coli, Calbiochem, catalog no. 345795) digestion was performed at 37 °C for 16 h in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and endo-β-galactosidase (5 milliunits, from Escherichia freundii, Seikagaku catalog no. 100455) digestion was performed at 37 °C for 16 h in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8. Recombinant α1–3fucosyltransferase from Helicobacter pylori strain NCTC11639 was kindly provided by Dr. Chun-Hung Lin (Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taiwan) (15Lin S.W. Yuan T.M. Li J.R. Lin C.H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The fucosylation reaction was carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm GDP-fucose (50 nmol). For in vitro enzymatic synthesis of glycans with hybrid type 1 and type 2 chains, 20 μm lacto-N-tetraose and lacto-N-neotetraose (Calbiochem) were separately incubated with recombinant human β3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (β3GnT2) in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm MnCl2 and 2 mm UDP-GlcNAc at 37 °C for 24 h. The reactions were then terminated by boiling at 100 °C for 5 min. Subsequently, one half of each product was incubated with recombinant human β3-galactosyltransferase 5 (β3GalT5), and the other half was incubated with recombinant human β4-galactosyltransferase 1 (β4GalT1) along with 1 mm UDP-Gal for another 24 h at 37 °C. Glycans with linear extended type 1 or type 2 chains were synthesized by incubation with β3GalT5 and β3GnT2 or with β4GalT1 and β3GnT2, respectively, in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing MnCl2, UDP-GlcNAc, and UDP-Gal as described above. For the I-branching β6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (IGnT) assay, the glycan chains were similarly incubated with recombinant human IGnT1–3 (16Inaba N. Hiruma T. Togayachi A. Iwasaki H. Wang X.H. Furukawa Y. Sumi R. Kudo T. Fujimura K. Iwai T. Gotoh M. Nakamura M. Narimatsu H. Blood. 2003; 101: 2870-2876Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in 25 mm HEPES containing 10 mm EDTA and 5 mm UDP-GlcNAc. All recombinant human glycosyltransferases were produced in HEK293T cells and were used as described (17Togayachi A. Sato T. Narimatsu H. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 416: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). On completion, the reaction mixtures were spun through an Ultrafree-MC filter unit (0.22 μm, polyvinylidene difluoride, Millipore), and the synthesized free glycans along with any unreacted acceptor were recovered from the filtrate by passing through the Envi-carb SPE tube, as described above. Fractionation and Purification of Trimeric Type 1 Chain—HPLC purification of the glycans released from GSLs was performed on a normal phase Type N PALPAK column (Takara, 250 × 4.6 mm). Buffer A was 75% acetonitrile in 200 mm triethylamine, and buffer B was 50% acetonitrile in 200 mm triethylamine. The sample was eluted at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min with the program set at isocratic elution in 100% solvent A for 5 min followed by a stepwise linear gradient to 50% solvent B in 5 min, to 85% solvent B in 40 min, and finally to 100% solvent B in 10 min. Aliquots from every five fractions were combined and screened by MS to locate eluted glycans. (Gal-GlcNAc)3Lac was eluted at 22–24 min by this program. Quantification of IGnT Transcripts—Total RNA of the Colo205 colon cancer cell line was prepared using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The first-strand cDNAs were primed using oligo-dT primer and synthesized by SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The forward IAF16 (5′-GACACTCAACAGGATTCCCGGTGTTCC-3′, nucleotides +906 through +932 of exon 1A of the IGnT gene, translation initiation codon as nucleotides +1 ∼ +3), IBF18 (5′-CCAGTGGTCCAAGGACACTTTCAGTCCTGA-3′, nucleotides +902 through +929 of exon 1B of the IGnT gene), and ICF20 (5′-CACTTAATAGGGTTTCAGGTGTTCCTGG-3′, nucleotides +908 through +935 of exon 1C of the IGnT gene) primers were used to amplify IGnTA, IGnTB, and IGnTC cDNAs, respectively, by PCR. The reverse primer used, IRs (5′-CCAGCTGGGTTGTATCGCAG-3′, complementary to the sequence locating in exon 3 of the IGnT gene), was common for the 3 IGnT cDNAs. PCR for the β-actin cDNA was performed using the ACTF (5′-GCACCAGGGCGTGATGG-3′) and ACTR (5′-GCCTCGGTCAGCAGCA-3′) primers. The cDNA sample and 2 pmol of each forward and reverse primer were added to 20 ml of the SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Real-time PCR detection (GenAmp 7300 Sequence Detection System, Applied Biosystems) was used for quantification of the transcripts. Serial dilutions of the pGEM-T vector (Promega Co., Madison, WI) containing IGnTA, IGnTB, IGnTC, or β-actin cDNAs were used to generate standard curves for each transcript. The IGnTA, IGnTB, and IGnTC genes as described (18Yu L.C. Twu Y.C. Chou M.L. Reid M.E. Gray A.R. Moulds J.M. Chang C.Y. Lin M. Blood. 2003; 101: 2081-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) encode for the IGnT2, IGnT1, and IGnT3 enzymes (19Shiraishi N. Natsume A. Togayachi A. Endo T. Akashima T. Yamada Y. Imai N.

MS and MS/MS Analysis—All glycan samples were permethylated using the NaOH/dimethyl sulfoxide slurry method as described by Dell et al. (20Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Briefly, NaOH pellets were grounded in DMSO until a slurry was formed. 0.5 ∼ 1 ml of the DMSO/NaOH slurry was added to glycans dried down in screw-capped glass tubes followed by about 0.2 ml of methyl iodide (Merck). The reaction mixtures were vortexed and placed on the automatic shaker for 20 min at room temperature, after which the reaction was terminated by the a dropwise addition of 1 ml of water. Permethylated sample was then extracted into 1 ml of chloroform and washed several times with water. For MALDI-TOF MS profiling, permethylated samples were dissolved in acetonitrile and mixed 1:1 with 10 mg/ml 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Sigma) in acetonitrile for spotting onto the target plate. Data acquisition was performed on either a bench top MALDI LR system (Waters Micromass) or a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), both operated in the reflectron mode. MALDI-MS/MS analyses of permethylated glycan and GSL samples at low collision energy were performed on a Q/TOF Ultima™ MALDI (Waters Micromass) using α-cyano-4-hydrocinnamic acid as matrix (5 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid mixed 1:1 with sample dissolved in acetonitrile). Argon was used as the collision gas with a collision energy manually adjusted between 100 and 200 V to achieve an optimum degree of fragmentation. Alternatively, multistage low energy CID-MSn of the permethylated glycans were acquired on an AXIMA™-QIT (Kratos Analytical, Shimadzu) using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as a matrix as described (21Koy C. Mikkat S. Raptakis E. Sutton C. Resch M. Tanaka K. Glocker M.O. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Kameyama A. Kikuchi N. Nakaya S. Ito H. Sato T. Shikanai T. Takahashi Y. Takahashi K. Narimatsu H. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 4719-4725Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). High energy CID MS/MS analyses were performed on the 4700 Proteomics Analyzer TOF-TOF system using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as matrix. The potential difference between the source acceleration voltage and the collision cell was set at 3 kV. The indicated collision cell pressure was increased from 3 × 10–8 (no gas) to around 2 × 10–6 torr by letting in argon as the collision gas. All CID MS/MS data were acquired and processed manually. The Overall Profile and Characteristic Patterns of GSLs from Colo205—Multifucosylated variants of extended type 1 chain were first identified in the form of Leb-Lea and Lea-Lea on GSLs isolated from tumors in nude mice implanted with Colo205 (8Stroud M.R. Levery S.B. Nudelman E.D. Salyan M.E. Towell J.A. Roberts C.E. Watanabe M. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8439-8446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Stroud M.R. Levery S.B.

Although it was evident from HPTLC immunostaining that smaller and larger Lea-carrying GSLs were present (Fig. 1A, inset), a more definitive overall profile such as one that would be afforded by MS analysis was not presented. In this work, total and further fractionated GSLs similarly extracted from harvested Colo205 cell cultures were mapped by MALDI-MS before and after permethylation (Fig. 1A). Based on the mass shifts observed after derivatization and further MS/MS analyses, the GSLs detected can in general be defined as Fucn(Hex-HexNAc)n-LacCer, where (Hex-HexNAc)n refers to either type 1 or 2 units, and LacCer refers to Galβ1–4-Glc (Lac) linked to the ceramide (Cer) core (Table 1).FIGURE 2Characteristic high energy CID MS/MS fragmentation pattern of fucosylated types 1 and 2 glycan chains. MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS spectrum of permethylated Leb-Lea-Lac isolated from Colo205 GSLs (A) is compared with that of an authentic Leb-Lex-Lac standard (B). MALDI-Q/TOF analyses of the same samples afforded mainly the B, Y, C, and Z ions only (i), whereas MALDI-TOF/TOF analyses afforded additional cleavage ions (ii), as schematically illustrated on the respective figures. Symbol keys used and the nomenclature of the ions are shown in (C) together with schematic drawing illustrating the key D ions which allow discrimination of Lea versus Lex. The types of cleavage ions were annotated for each of the major fragment ions assigned, the origin of which can be referred to the schematic drawings (i) and (ii).

Open table in a new tab As expected, the Colo205 GSLs MS profile is clearly dominated by signal clusters corresponding to multiply fucosylated (Hex-HexNAc)1,2-LacCer. The larger and those sialylated ones were visibly present but would become more apparent only after charge and size fractionation (Fig. 1, A and B, upper spectra). Within the signal clusters, mass differences of 14 (CH2) or 30 (OCH2) mass units indicated heterogeneity in the fatty acyl chain length and the additional presence of hydroxyl group, respectively, whereas 142 mass units is a common mass difference corresponding to a C16:0 to hydroxylated C24:0 substitution. Removal of the highly heterogeneous ceramide moiety by ceramide glycanase yielded a much simplified MS profile with distinctive [M+Na]+ molecular ion signals for the released glycan structures that share the backbone composition, (Hex-HexNAc)n-Lac (Fig. 1B, Table 1). Thus, the major signal at m/z 1100 corresponds to permethylated Fuc1(Hex-HexNAc)1-Lac, and those at m/z 1723 and 1897 correspond to permethylated Fuc2,3(Hex-HexNAc)2-Lac, which are consistent with previous identification of Leb/a-Lea-LacCer as the characteristic GSLs of Colo205. Importantly, the data also unambiguously revealed the presence of Fuc2–4(Hex-HexNAc)3-Lac (m/z 2173, 2347, and 2521) and Fuc2–4(Hex-HexNAc)4-Lac (m/z 2622, 2796, and 2970) in the fraction highly enriched for the trimeric Lewis structures (Fig. 1, A and B, upper spectra). These were taken for MS/MS analyses along with the already well characterized Leb-Lea-Lac structure and a commercially available Leb-Lex-Lac standard, which serve to establish the fragmentation pattern that would allow discrimination of type 1 and 2 chains. MALDI MS/MS Characteristics for Identification of Type 1 and 2 Chains—We have previously demonstrated that the low and high energy CID MALDI MS/MS fragmentation pattern of complex glycans as acquired on the Q/TOF and TOF/TOF, respectively, are highly complementary. Although the overall sequence, branching pattern, core type, and terminal epitope substituents of an N-or O-glycan were found to be best determined via low energy CID MS/MS due to its simplicity, high energy CID MS/MS on a TOF/TOF can provide additional linkage information through a more complicated cleavage pattern (14Yu S.Y. Wu S.W. Khoo K.H. Glycoconj. J. 2006; 23: 355-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In general, a type 1 chain or Lea epitope is distinguished from a type 2 chain or Lex via the C3-linkage specific cleavage. Low energy CID MS/MS of permethylated glycans on a Q/TOF would readily afford a Z ion via elimination of glycosyl subst"

Here we report the phosphorylation of TAp63γ, but not ΔNp63γ, by IκB kinase β (IKKβ). Activation of IKKβ by γ radiation or tumor necrosis factor-α led to increased TAp63γ protein levels in cells. IKKβ, but not its kinase-defective mutant IKKβ-K44A, led to this observed stabilization of TAp63γ. This stabilization of TAp63γ in response to γ radiation was significantly decreased in the absence of IKKβ. Phosphorylation of TAp63γ blocks ubiquitylation and possible degradation of this protein. We postulate that phosphorylation of TAp63γ by IKKβ stabilizes the TAp63γ protein by blocking ubiquitylation-dependent degradation of this protein.

In addition to expression from these alternative promoters, alternative splicing results in three different isoforms, α, β, and γ, which have different C termini.

Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The major role for p63 appears to be in the regulation of epithelial development (11Mills A.A. Zheng B. Wang X.J. Vogel H.

This observation demonstrates a requirement for p63 for the formation of the epidermis and other stratified epithelia.

IKKα along with IKKβ form the catalytic component of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex along with the regulatory IKKγ subunit. Upon activation through various stimuli such as the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα, this complex phosphorylates IκBα (a negative regulator of NFκB) leading to its degradation in a ubiquitin-dependent pathway. This results in the release of NFκB from the cytoplasm into the nucleus where it activates various target genes (19Israel A. Le Bail O. Hatat D. Piette J. Kieran M. Logeat F. Wallach D. Fellous M.

More recently it has been shown that TAp63 directly trans-activates IKKα through binding of a p53 consensus sequence on the promoter of IKKα (22Candi E. Terrinoni A. Rufini A. Chikh A. Lena A.M.

From these phosphorylation studies it has been suggested that p63 protein levels can change rapidly as a result of post-translational modification. In particular, limited studies of the phosphorylation status of p63 have been reported (2Osada M. Ohba M. Kawahara C. Ishioka C. Kanamaru R. Katoh I. Ikawa Y. Nimura Y. Nakagawara A. Obinata M.

A recent report demonstrates phosphorylation of TA-p63α in response to DNA damage through treatment with γ radiation (34Suh E.K. Yang A. Kettenbach A. Bamberger C. Michaelis A.H. Zhu Z. Elvin J.A. Bronson R.T. Crum C.P. McKeon F. Nature. 2006; 444: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In an effort to establish when and how TAp63γ is phosphorylated in cells, we have conducted a series of biochemical and cellular studies. These studies demonstrate that the IKKβ is the major IKK catalytic subunit for TAp63γ phosphorylation but does not phosphorylate ΔNp63γ. In addition, upon activation of IKKβ kinase activity by exposure of cells to γ radiation or tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), TAp63γ but not ΔNp63γ levels increase rapidly. In addition, upon co-expression of IKKβ, a significant increase in TAp63γ half-life was observed. We postulate that this is because of our observed phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of the ubiquitylation of TAp63γ. Plasmids and Antibodies—The pEGFP-C1-ΔNp63γ plasmid was constructed using ΔNp63γ cDNA (4Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Keller D.M. Lu H.

Analysis of p63γ Half-life in Cells—For determination of the exogenous p63γ half-life, H1299 cells were transfected with the pEGFP-C1-TAp63γ plasmid alone or together with the FLAG-IKKβ expression plasmid as described above. 48 h after transfection, transiently transfected cells in 100-mm plates were treated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide and harvested at different time points as indicated for the preparation of cell lysates. Equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot using the monoclonal anti-p63 antibody. These experiments were repeated twice. p63γ in Vivo Ubiquitylation Assay—An in vivo ubiquitylation assay was conducted as described previously (35Xirodimas D. Saville M.K. Edling C. Lane D.P. Lain S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4972-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). H1299 cells in 100-mm plates were transfected with His6-ubiquitin (2 μg), FLAG-tagged IKK (2 μg), or pEGFP-C1-TAp63γ (2 μg). Transfected cells were treated with 10 μm of the proteasome inhibitor overnight before being harvested. 48 h after transfection, cells from each plate were harvested and split into 2 aliquots, one for straight immunoblot analysis and the other for detection of ubiquitylated proteins using Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen). Cell pellets were lysed in buffer A (6 m guanidinium chloride, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated with Ni-NTA beads at room temperature for 4 h. Beads were washed once with buffer A, buffer B (8 m urea, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and buffer C (8 m urea, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.3, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Proteins were eluted from beads with buffer D (200 mm imidazole, 0.15 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 30% glycerol, 0.72 m β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% SDS). The eluted proteins were analyzed by immunoblot for the polyubiquitylation of p63γ with monoclonal p63 antibodies. p63γ Is Phosphorylated by IKKα and IKKβ in Cells—Activation of p53 and p73 is known to occur through phosphorylation (23Agami R.

Nature. 1999; 399: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that TAp63γ, like p53 and p73, is regulated through acetylation (7MacPartlin M. Zeng S. Lee H. Stauffer D. Jin Y. Thayer M. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30604-30610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study we have examined whether TAp63γ also shares another post-translational modification common to p53 and p73, phosphorylation. It has been suggested previously that TAp63γ is phosphorylated in cells. Upon treatment of cells expressing TAp63γ with the Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid (OA), a clear shift in mobility of TAp63γ was observed by Western blot (39Okada Y. Osada M. Kurata S. Sato S. Aisaki K. Kageyama Y. Kihara K. Ikawa Y. Katoh I. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 276: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To elucidate whether the shift observed was in fact because of phosphorylation, we conducted further experiments to identify whether TAp63γ and ΔNp63γ isoforms of p63 are indeed phosphorylated. Human p53 null lung carcinoma H1299 cells were transfected with GFP-tagged TAp63γ and ΔNp63γ. Four hours prior to harvesting, the cells were treated with OA. p63 proteins from the cell lysates were detected by Western blot using an antibody that recognizes all isoforms of p63. Treatment of the transfected cells with okadaic acid led to a clear mobility shift for the TA form of p63γ (Fig. 1A). As reported previously, this result suggests that TAp63γ is phosphorylated in cells (39Okada Y. Osada M. Kurata S. Sato S. Aisaki K. Kageyama Y. Kihara K. Ikawa Y. Katoh I. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 276: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). No mobility shift for ΔNp63γ was observed upon treatment of cells with OA (Fig. 1B). Like p63, the protein kinase IKKα is known to play an important role in skin development (40Sil A.K. Maeda S. Sano Y. Roop D.R. Karin M. Nature. 2004; 428: 660-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to examine whether IKK kinases could phosphorylate p63γ. The IKK complex consists of three subunits, IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ (41Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar, 42Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A.

As described earlier, these proteins play an important role in the NFκB regulatory pathway (20Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A.

Ben-Neriah Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10599-10603Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Upon co-expression of TAp63γ or ΔNp63γ together with FLAG-IKKα or FLAG-IKKβ, TAp63γ, but not ΔNp63γ, underwent a mobility shift (data not shown). In our studies this mobility shift was more strongly visible upon co-expression of the IKKβ protein, suggesting IKKβ overexpression leads to a higher level of phosphorylated TAp63γ than IKKα overexpression, similar to that seen for IκBα (41Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar, 46Wu C. Ghosh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31980-31987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The experiment was repeated in the presence of OA. Upon co-transfection of IKKα or IKKβ with TAp63γ, the shifted migration of TAp63γ was stronger than observed with OA alone (Fig. 1C, lanes 1, 3, and 5). To confirm that this mobility shift is because of phosphorylation of TAp63γ, each cell lysate (using EDTA-free lysis buffer) was split in half and incubated in the presence or absence of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) for 1 h at 37°C. Upon CIP treatment, a distinct reduction or obliteration of the mobility shift was observed (Fig. 1C, lanes 2, 4, and 6). This suggests that the change in TAp63γ mobility upon both treatment of the cells with OA and co-expression of the IKK proteins is phosphorylation-dependent. Upon co-expression of IKKβ and p63γ in the presence of OA, only the higher mobility p63γ band was observed (Fig. 1C, lane 5). This suggests that IKKβ may act as the predominant IKK catalytic subunit for TAp63γ. IKKα and IKKβ are known to have largely nonoverlapping functions and to have different substrate specificities (47Hacker, H., and Karin, M. (2006) Sci. STKE 2006 (357) RE13Google Scholar). The observed phosphorylation of TAp63γ by IKKβ is further confirmed in Fig. 1D. A side by side comparison of H1299 cells expressing TAp63γ in the presence of either IKKβ expression or treatment with OA demonstrates a comparable shift in mobility of TAp63γ. Combination of the two leads to a single slower mobility phosphorylated form of TAp63γ. A titration of IKKβ co-expressed with TAp63γ led to a clear increase in the level of the slower migrating form of TAp63γ (Fig. 1E, lanes 1–4). In fact, this higher form was the only one visible upon treatment with OA, and it increased with an increasing amount of IKKβ expression (Fig. 1E, lanes 6–8). In addition, a co-expression of a kinase-dead form of IKKβ, IKKβ-K44A (defective in binding to ATP), did not induce a mobility shift for TAp63γ (Fig. 3B). Co-expression of FLAG-IKKβ with GFP-ΔNp63γ did not lead to a visible mobility shift (Fig. 1F). p63γ Is Differentially Phosphorylated by IKKα and IKKβ in Vitro—To confirm that TAp63γ is a substrate for IKKα and IKKβ, IP kinase assays were utilized. FLAG-tagged IKK proteins were expressed in HEK293 cells, and the proteins were recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2A, top right panel). After an extensive wash, this immune complex was used in an in vitro kinase assay. His-tagged TAp63γ was purified from E. coli and used as a substrate in the IP kinase assay as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 2A, bottom right panel). Phosphorylated products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. IKKβ was again observed to be the major IKK catalytic subunit for TAp63γ phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3). GST-IκBα, a known substrate for IKK kinase activity, was also purified and used as a substrate in the IP kinase assay. GST-IκBα was used as a positive control for the assay (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6), and as reported previously, IKKβ is also the major catalytic IKK activity for IκBα (1Li J. Peet G.W. Pullen S.S.

Dang L.C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9319-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The observation that co-expression of IKKβ proteins and TAp63γ in cells results in a mobility shift in TAp63γ but not in ΔNp63γ suggests that phosphorylation of TAp63γ by IKKβ occurs at the N terminus of this protein. To further investigate the region of TAp63γ phosphorylated by IKKβ, we used purified His-tagged deletion mutants of TAp63γ (F1, amino acids 1–131; F2, amino acids 131–358; F3, amino acids 359–448; F4, amino acids 390–448, and TA, amino acids 1–69) as substrates in an IP kinase assay with IKKβ (Fig. 2B, right panel). A strong phosphorylation signal was seen using either p63γTA or p63γ-F1 but not when using the other fragments, supporting the idea that phosphorylation of TAp63γ by IKKβ occurs at the N-terminal domain, within the first 69 amino acids (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 10). These phosphoproteins were absent, as shown for p63γTA, when IKKβ was replaced by IKKβ-K44A, a kinase-dead form of IKKβ (Fig. 2C) (20Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.

Activation of IKKβ Activity in Cells Leads to Increased Phosphorylation and Protein Levels of TAp63γ—Exposure of cells to different forms of genotoxic stress, such as ionizing (γ) radiation, stimulates signaling pathways that are known to activate transcription factors such as NF-κB and p53. IKKβ has been demonstrated to be activated in response to γ radiation (maximal at 20 Gy), which leads to induction of NF-κB activity (51Li N. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13012-13017Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). p53 has also been shown to be activated and phosphorylated in response to γ radiation (52Kuerbitz S.J. Plunkett B.S. Walsh W.V.

To test whether activation of IKKβ by γ radiation had any effect on TAp63γ, we initially co-transfected HEK293 (p53 inactive) with expression plasmids for FLAG-IKKβ and GFP-tagged TAp63γ.

https://openalex.org/W2008039653,"Tripeptidyl peptidase I (TPP I) is the first mammalian representative of a family of pepstatin-insensitive serine-carboxyl proteases, or sedolisins. The enzyme acts in lysosomes, where it sequentially removes tripeptides from the unmodified N terminus of small, unstructured polypeptides. Naturally occurring mutations in TPP I underlie a neurodegenerative disorder of childhood, classic late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN2). Generation of mature TPP I is associated with removal of a long prosegment of 176 amino acid residues from the zymogen. Here we investigated the inhibitory properties of TPP I prosegment expressed and isolated from Escherichia coli toward its cognate protease. We show that the TPP I prosegment is a potent, slow-binding inhibitor of its parent enzyme, with an overall inhibition constant in the low nanomolar range. We also demonstrate the protective effect of the prosegment on alkaline pH-induced inactivation of the enzyme. Interestingly, the inhibitory properties of TPP I prosegment with the introduced classic late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis disease-associated mutation, G77R, significantly differed from those revealed by wild-type prosegment in both the mechanism of interaction and the inhibitory rate. This is the first characterization of the inhibitory action of the sedolisin prosegment."
https://openalex.org/W2028429546,"Neuroimaging studies of speech processing increasingly rely on artificial speech-like sounds whose perceptual status as speech or non-speech is assigned by simple subjective judgments; brain activation patterns are interpreted according to these status assignments. The naïve perceptual status of one such stimulus, spectrally-rotated speech (not consciously perceived as speech by naïve subjects), was evaluated in discrimination and forced identification experiments. Discrimination of variation in spectrally-rotated syllables in one group of naïve subjects was strongly related to the pattern of similarities in phonological identification of the same stimuli provided by a second, independent group of naïve subjects, suggesting either that (1) naïve rotated syllable perception involves phonetic-like processing, or (2) that perception is solely based on physical acoustic similarity, and similar sounds are provided with similar phonetic identities. Analysis of acoustic (Euclidean distances of center frequency values of formants) and phonetic similarities in the perception of the vowel portions of the rotated syllables revealed that discrimination was significantly and independently influenced by both acoustic and phonological information. We conclude that simple subjective assessments of artificial speech-like sounds can be misleading, as perception of such sounds may initially and unconsciously utilize speech-like, phonological processing."

Here we cloned two een genes (designated as eena and eenb) in zebrafish, which are assigned to linkage groups 8 and 2, respectively. Whole-mount in situ hybridization assay showed that eena and eenb have overlapping but distinct expression patterns during embryogenesis. Ubiquitous or targeted overexpression of eena, but not eenb, into wild-type or transgenic embryos (green fluorescent protein-labeled myeloid progenitors) induced a significant proliferation and ectopic distribution of myeloid progenitors in the yolk sac. Using a morpholino antisense gene knockdown approach, we showed that the number of myeloid progenitors and their downstream mature myelomonocytic cells was significantly decreased in the eena- deficient embryos. Mechanistically, overexpression of eena selectively stimulated ERK phosphorylation and increased the level of transcription factor c-Fos in vitro and in vivo, whereas eena lacking the Src homology 3 domain completely abolished these effects. Furthermore, a MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059, blocked the eena-induced cell proliferation and activation of ERK signaling.

In addition, endophilin-Ca2+ channel complex is required for synaptic vesicle endocytosis (11Chen Y. Deng L. Maeno-Hikichi Y. Lai M. Chang S. Chen G. Zhang J.F. Cell. 2003; 115: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated that EEN could bind BPGAP1 and is involved in the activation of epidermal growth factor receptor endocytosis and ERK1/2 signaling (12Lua B.L. Low B.C. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2707-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). EEN is also engaged in Ras signaling and cellular transformation through binding EBP (13Yam J.W. Jin D.Y. So C.W. Chan L.C. Blood. 2004; 103: 1445-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). EEN is the only member in the family expressed in hematopoietic tissues, including bone marrow and fetal liver (1So C.W. Caldas C. Liu M.M. Chen S.J. Huang Q.H. Gu L.J. Sham M.H. Wiedemann L.M. Chan L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2563-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, as a myeloid leukemia-associated gene, the role of EEN in myeloid development and leukemogenesis has not been fully explored. In mammals, it is relatively difficult to access early developmental processes such as primitive myelopoiesis because they occur within the mother's body. Zebrafish has become an ideal organism for the study of normal and abnormal hematopoiesis. Hematopoiesis has been shown to be very similar to that of higher vertebrates, and homologues of a large number of genes involved in mammalian hematopoiesis have been identified in the zebrafish (14de Jong J.L. Zon L.I. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 481-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 15Song H.D. Sun X.J. Deng M. Zhang G.W. Zhou Y. Wu X.Y. Sheng Y. Chen Y. Ruan Z. Jiang C.L. Fan H.Y. Zon L.I.

In zebrafish, as in mammals, primitive and definitive hematopoieses arise successively in the intermediate cell mass (ICM) and the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta in the developing embryos (16Davidson A.J. Zon L.I. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7233-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In this study, we have cloned two zebrafish orthologues of the mammalian EEN gene, termed eena and eenb, and investigated the evolutionary relationship of these genes and expression patterns during early embryonic development. Our results suggest that zebrafish eena and eenb result from a gene duplication event at the een locus and that this may lead to their functional divergence. We also showed that eena and eenb were expressed maternally and ubiquitously, implying a role in early embryonic development. However, at the later stages, eenb was only observed in hatching gland, whereas eena expression was still ubiquitous and richly detected in the ICM at 22 h post-fertilization (hpf). Furthermore, we focused on the function of eena and eenb in myeloid development in vivo because EEN has been found fused to MLL in acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we showed that knockdown of Eena caused a significant suppression in the myeloid cells development, whereas overexpression of eena, but not eenb, led to an increased number of myeloid progenitors through stimulating ERK phosphorylation and the subsequent up-regulation of zebrafish c-fos mRNA. In addition, the N-terminal part of eena, which lacked the SH3 domain, acted as a potential dominant negative mutant and dramatically abolished these effects. Our data indicate that eena regulates myeloid development through activation of the ERK signal pathway, which provides a novel insight into the role of EEN in leukemogenesis caused by MLL-EEN.

Westerfield M The Zebrafish Book: A Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish (Danio rerio). .9, University of Oregon Press, Eugene1995: 1.1-1.9Google Scholar). Transgenic line TG(zpu.1:EGFP) was kindly provided by Drs. John Kanki and A. Thomas Look at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (18Hsu K. Traver D. Kutok J.L. Hagen A. Liu T.X. Paw B.H. Rhodes J. Berman J.N. Zon L.I. Kanki J.P. Look A.T. Blood. 2004; 104: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Embryos were staged as described by Kimmel et al. (19Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8765) Google Scholar). Developmental stages refer to hours (hpf) or days (dpf) post-fertilization. Cloning and Plasmids Construction—Zebrafish eena and eenb genes were identified based on homology to human EEN. The specific primers were designed according to genomic sequence in the UCSC (University of California, Santa Cruz) data base (see primer sequences in supplemental Table 1). The amplified PCR product was purified and subcloned into pCS2+ for in vitro synthesis of capped mRNA for microinjection. Then eena and eenaΔSH3 fragments were digested with BamHI and XhoI sites from pCS2+ vector and cloned into an I-sceI-containing plasmid vector between a 9.0-kb zebrafish pu.1 (zpu.1) promoter sequence (18Hsu K. Traver D. Kutok J.L. Hagen A. Liu T.X. Paw B.H. Rhodes J. Berman J.N. Zon L.I. Kanki J.P. Look A.T. Blood. 2004; 104: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and an SV40 polyadenylation site, which resulted in the constructs of pu.1-eena and pu.1-eenaΔSH3 for microinjection, respectively. The plasmid of pEGFP-EEN was constructed by Liu et al. (20Liu H. Chen B. Xiong H. Huang Q.H. Zhang Q.H. Wang Z.G. Li B.L. Chen Z. Chen S.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3385-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Multiple Sequence Alignment, Phylogenetic Trees, and Gene Structure Analysis—Protein sequences for endophilins of zebrafish and other species were obtained from GenBank™ to determine the phylogenetic relationships. 4Protein sequences with Entrez protein accession numbers from human EEN (NP_003016), mouse EEN (NP_038692), chick EEN (NP_989860), and Xenopus EEN (AAH61395) can be found at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Protein sequences for Danio rerio (zebrafish), Fugu rubripes (fugu), Gasterosteus aculeatus (stickleback), and Oryzias latipes (medaka) were found by searching the predicted protein database of each species and can be found on Ensembl. Zebrafish, Eena (NP_958905); zebrafish Eenb (NP_956595), fugu Eena (SINFRUT00000144757), fugu Eenb (SINFRUP00000151916), stickleback Eena (ENSGACP00000016230), stickleback Eenb (ENSGACP00000020231), medaka Eena (ENSORLP00000004783), and medaka Eenb (ENSORLP00000018713). Multiple alignments of amino acid sequences for een genes were obtained by using the ClustalX 1.83 alignment program and subsequently analyzed with the Neighbor Joining method to construct a phylogenetic tree by using Mega3.1 software (21Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (2878) Google Scholar, 22Kumar S. Tamura K. Nei M. Brief. Bioinform. 2004; 5: 150-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (10647) Google Scholar). A bootstrap test was performed with 1,000 repetitions. Genomic sequences of human EEN and zebrafish eena and eenb were obtained by searching the corresponding genome sequence data bases, which have complete information on loci and putative exon arrangement of een genes, as well as on transcript and protein sequences. The exon and intron arrangements of zebrafish eena and eenb genes were defined based on the information deposited in the DNA data base, and checked by amino acid sequence alignment of the corresponding cDNAs. Identification of Syntenic Relationship—The Sanger Zv6 zebrafish genome assembly was searched for sequences with similarity to human EEN protein using tBLASTn. We applied the reciprocal best “hit” method (23Hirsh A.E. Fraser H.B. Nature. 2001; 411: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) for syntenic analysis and compared genes neighboring the zebrafish een to the genes neighboring the human EEN. The map positions of the corresponding human genes were obtained on line. Whole-mount in Situ Hybridization—To localize eena and eenb, as well as c-fos mRNAs in zebrafish embryo, whole-mount in situ hybridization was carried out. pCS2+ containing eena or eenb 3′-UTR (352 and 150 bp, respectively) was utilized to generate antisense RNA probes for eena and eenb using digoxigenin-11-uridine 5′-triphosphate (Roche Applied Science). Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at the stages indicated, and whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed as described (24Paffett-Lugassy N.N. Zon L.I. Methods Mol. Med. 2005; 105: 171-198PubMed Google Scholar). These probes were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies (1:5,000) (Roche Applied Science) using the substrates 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (purple color) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). At least 10 embryos were used at each stage, and all showed similar expression patterns. After staining, embryos were mounted in 3% methylcellulose and captured under the Nikon SMZ1500 microscope equipped with a Nikon DXM1200F digital camera and ACT-1 software. Microinjection of Zebrafish Embryos—The expression vectors pCS2+-eena and pCS2+-eenb were linearized with NotI and transcribed in vitro with SP6 RNA polymerase in the presence of m7G (59)ppp(59)G (Ambion) to produce capped transcripts and were microinjected into one-cell stage embryos. Embryos were microinjected with 100 pg of EGFP mRNA or diethyl pyrocarbonate water as controls, using an air pressure injector and glass capillaries. To specifically express Eena in myeloid progenitors, the pu.1-eena and pu.1-eenaΔSH3 plasmids were prepared with endotoxin-free midiprep kit (Promega) and injected into TG(zpu.1:EGFP) embryos with 100 pg of DNA, 0.5× I-sceI buffer and 0.5 units/μlI-sceI meganuclease (New England Biolabs). Injection experiments were performed three times. EGFP expression was directly observed under a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss Lumar V12 stereomicroscope equipped with an AxioCam MRC5digital camera and Axio-Vision Rel.4.5 software). The morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (MO) targeted against eena was synthesized by Gene-Tools LLC (Philomath, OR). The sequence was as follows: 5′-CTTCTTTAAGCCCGCCACGGACATC-3′. The 5-base mismatch MO sequence was 5′-CTTgTTTAAcCCCcCCAaGGAgATC-3′. MOs were diluted to obtain 1 mm stock solution in 1× Danieau buffer and were microinjected at a volume of 2 nl into one-cell stage embryos. Cell Culture and Transfection—NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. For transfection, NIH3T3 cells were seeded on sterile glass coverslips (BDH) in 6-well plates (BD Biosciences) and grown for 24 h before transfection. Transfections were performed using 2-6 μg of plasmid cDNA and SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested for RT-PCR at 24 h after transfection. RT-PCR and Immunofluorescence—After injection or transfection, embryos or cells were harvested at 22 hpf or 24 h, respectively, and lysed in TRIzol (Invitrogen), followed by standard total RNA extraction. The expression of nuclear transcription factors was detected by serial dilution semiquantitative RT-PCR assay using indicated primers (supplemental Table 1). Embryos were fixed after 22 hpf with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight and perforated with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 10 min, then blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h, followed by incubation with anti-EGFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-phosphohistone H3 antibody or anti-c-Fos antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) at 4 °C overnight. The embryos were incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies for 1 h (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Western Blot—Deyolking embryos and protein immunoblotting were performed as described previously (25Link V. Shevchenko A. Heisenberg C.P. BMC Dev. Biol. 2006; 6: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Anti-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), anti-JNK, anti-p-JNK, anti-p38, anti-p-p38, and anti-actin antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-EEN antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, was purchased from Calbiochem. Statistical Analysis—Embryos were mounted in 95% glycerol, and the number of cells in the anterior yolk sac was counted under the Zeiss microscope (80×). Data were reported as mean values ± S.E. and statistically compared using one-way analysis of variance followed with least significant difference or Student's t test. Statistical significance was accepted when p < 0.05. Characterization and Phylogenetic and Syntenic Analyses of the Zebrafish een Orthologues—After searching the zebrafish genome data base, we identified two een genes, which we refer to as eena and eenb, respectively. The zebrafish eena cDNA (NM_201497) consisted of 1,662-bp and encoded a predicted protein of 351 amino acids (∼38 kDa). And eenb cDNA (NM_200301) was 1,460-bp and encoded a predicted protein of 365 amino acids (∼39 kDa) (Fig. 1A). At the nucleic acid level, within the coding region, the cDNAs of zebrafish eena and eenb were 72% identical, whereas within the 3′-UTR, the similarity dropped to 8%. We then aligned the complete cDNA coding sequence of eena and eenb with the genomic sequence to reveal the exon-intron structure. eenb spans 30.89 kb in the genome and contains 10 exons, each aligning with the 10 human exons. In contrast, eena spans 37.49 kb in the genome and has retained only 9 exons, with exons 1-8 aligning with human exons 1-8 and exon 9 aligning with human exon 10, suggesting that eena is missing a sequence homologous to human exon 9, which encodes a variable region acting as a joint linking the BAR and SH3 domain. Comparisons of exon lengths of the two zebrafish een genes with the human EEN indicated a high degree of crossspecies conservation (supplemental Table 2). We next examined the relationship of eena and eenb amino acid sequences in zebrafish to mammalian endophilin family members in more detail. Results suggested that the highest BLASTP bit scores were with EEN (supplemental Table 3). In the BAR and SH3 domains, zebrafish Eena and Eenb were showed a very good conservation in comparison with mammalian EENs (supplemental Fig. 1). Using the neighbor-joining method, we constructed a phylogenetic tree with several known tetrapod sequences, including human, mouse, chick, and Xenopus (Fig. 1B). We were also able to identify two candidate copies of predicted een in the fugu, medaka, and stickleback genomes. To more precisely confirm the evolutionary conservation of EEN, we investigated the distribution of genes located adjacent to the EEN locus on chromosomes in zebrafish and human genomes. As shown in Fig. 1C, four genes, HLRC1, CREB3L3, STAP2, and SEMA6B, were located close to each other on human chromosome 19 near EEN, and their zebrafish orthologues can be found in the vicinity of eena on linkage group 8, indicating that zebrafish eena was an orthologue of human EEN. Human genes MBD3A, SF3A2, CHICO, CCDC94, and STAP2 close to EEN also have their zebrafish orthologues on linkage group 2 near eenb, supporting the idea that eenb was also an orthologue of human EEN. Taken together, it shows that the two zebrafish copies arose from a duplication event in the teleost lineage after the divergence from the tetrapod lineage but before the teleost radiation. This observation was consistent with the notion of a whole genome duplication in the teleost lineage (26Jaillon O. Aury J.M. Brunet F. Petit J.L. Stange-Thomann N. Mauceli E. Bouneau L. Fischer C. Ozouf-Costaz C. Bernot A. Nicaud S. Jaffe D. Fisher S. Lutfalla G. Dossat C. Segurens B. Dasilva C. Salanoubat M. Levy M. Boudet N. Castellano S. Anthouard V. Jubin C. Castelli V. Katinka M. Vacherie B. Biemont C. Skalli Z. Cattolico L. Poulain J. De Berardinis V. Cruaud C. Duprat S. Brottier P. Coutanceau J.P. Gouzy J. Parra G. Lardier G. Chapple C. McKernan K.J. McEwan P. Bosak S. Kellis M. Volff J.N. Guigo R. Zody M.C. Mesirov J. Lindblad-Toh K. Birren B. Nusbaum C. Kahn D. Robinson-Rechavi M. Laudet V. Schachter V. Quetier F. Saurin W. Scarpelli C. Wincker P. Lander E.S. Weissenbach J. Roest Crollius H. Nature. 2004; 431: 946-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar). Therefore, the above results strongly support that zebrafish eena and eenb are co-orthologues of the mammalian EEN. eena and eenb Expression during Embryogenesis—The temporal and spatial expression patterns of eena and eenb were investigated in zebrafish embryos from 0.75 to 120 hpf by in situ hybridization using digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probe. As shown in Fig. 2, strong signals were detectable in the blastomeres of the two-cell stage and the sphere period (4 hpf), indicating that both eena and eenb transcripts were maternally derived and suggesting a role in early embryonic development. Although the eena and eenb genes exhibited similar patterns of expression during the early stage, differential expression of the een genes was observed after the 18-somite stage (18 hpf). At that stage, high levels of eena transcripts were still strongly detected throughout the entire embryo, predominantly expressed in neural tissues (brain, spinal cord, and eye) and skeletal muscle, identical to that of EEN in mice described previously (27So C.W. Sham M.H. Chew S.L. Cheung N. So C.K. Chung S.K. Caldas C. Wiedemann L.M. Chan L.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 447-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). At 22 hpf, hematopoietic expression of eena was observed in the posterior ICM (Fig. 2A, red arrow in inset), a region analogous to the blood island of the yolk sac in mammals (28Detrich III, H.W. Kieran M.W. Chan F.Y. Barone L.M. Yee K. Rundstadler J.A. Pratt S. Ransom D. Zon L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10713-10717Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). By 28 hpf, very strong expression was also seen in the brain and weaker staining in the tail and the trunk. After 2 dpf, expression decreased and became mostly restricted to the notochord and optic capsule (Fig. 2A, black arrow) and then became undetectable by 5 dpf. By comparison, we found that eenb was restricted to the hatching gland during 18 and 22 hpf (Fig. 2B, black arrow), which has not been reported previously, then gradually disappeared after 30 hpf (data not shown). By 3-5 dpf, eenb expression was no longer observed. The eenb mRNA was not detected in ICM. To control for specificity, embryos of each stage were also probed in parallel with a sense probe, which gave no signal at any stage (data not shown). Our data provide the first insight into the embryonic expression profile of een genes in zebrafish. een mRNA Overexpression in Wild-type or Transgenic TG(zpu.1:EGFP) Zebrafish Embryos—It has been shown that eena was expressed in the ICM region, suggesting its possible role in zebrafish hematopoiesis. It was therefore interesting to explore the possible function of een on hematopoietic cells. We first microinjected synthetic zebrafish een mRNA into wild-type embryos at the one-cell stage and examined the hematopoietic marker expression, including scl (hematopoietic progenitors), gata1 (primitive erythroid lineage), and pu.1 (primitive myeloid precursors) (29Bennett C.M. Kanki J.P. Rhodes J. Liu T.X. Paw B.H. Kieran M.W. Langenau D.M. Delahaye-Brown A. Zon L.I. Fleming M.D. Look A.T. Blood. 2001; 98: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 30Liu T.X. Rhodes J. Deng M. Hsu K. Radomska H.S. Kanki J.P. Tenen D.G. Look A.T. Exp. Hematol. 2007; 35: 230-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As shown in supplemental Fig. 2, A and B, no obvious morphological changes were detected, and the expression of scl and gata1 was similar in 100 pg of either EGFP-, eena-, or eenb-injected embryos. However, compared with the EGFP-injected or eenb-injected embryos, injection with eena mRNA induced ectopic pu.1 expression (Fig. 3, A and B, red arrows and insets) and caused an increase in the number of pu.1-expressing myeloid cells at 14 and 22 hpf embryos (Fig. 3, A and B). To quantify this effect, we measured the number of pu.1-positive cells in the yolk sac. At 22 hpf, the mean number of control EGFP-injected or eenb-injected was 57.1 ± 2.92 (n = 83, pooled from three independent experiments) and 53.6 ± 2.36 (n = 91), respectively, whereas 40% eena-injected embryos reached to 80.1 ± 3.54 (n = 103). This value was significantly higher than the other two (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3C). The above results showed that eena overexpression affected early myeloid cells but not erythroid cells. To investigate whether Eena function is limited to the myeloid cells, we also examined the expressions of two non-myeloid markers krox-20 (ectoderm hindbrain-specific marker) (31Wiellette E.L. Sive H. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 3821-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and myoD (mesodermal muscle-expressing marker) (32Kobiyama A. Nihei Y. Hirayama Y. Kikuchi K. Suetake H. Johnston I.A. Watabe S. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 2801-2813Crossref Google Scholar), after overexpression of eena or eenb mRNA. Like scl and gata1 expression, expression of krox-20 and myoD was not affected in een overexpression embryos (supplemental Fig. 2, C and D). To further verify that the increased cells were indeed pu.1-positive cells but not from trans-differentiation of other cell types, we employed the well characterized transgenic line TG(zpu.1:EGFP), in which EGFP was expressed in the myeloid progenitors under the zpu.1 promoter (18Hsu K. Traver D. Kutok J.L. Hagen A. Liu T.X. Paw B.H. Rhodes J. Berman J.N. Zon L.I. Kanki J.P. Look A.T. Blood. 2004; 104: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and injected capped mRNAs encoding Eena or Eenb into embryos. As expected, about 43% eena-overexpression embryos (n = 108) significantly increased the number of pu.1+/EGFP+ cells to about 1.5-fold higher than that of the control (n = 101) (Fig. 3, D and E, the mean number of pu.1+/EGFP+ cells was 68.7 ± 4.35 and 40.5 ± 2.53, respectively), and the cells were also exhibited abnormal distribution in the yolk sac (Fig. 3D, white arrowheads). In addition, to test if mammalian EEN and zebrafish Een proteins are functionally conserved, we injected human EEN mRNA into TG(zpu.1:EGFP) embryos. Overexpression of human EEN resulted in the significant expansion of pu.1+/EGFP+ cells, similar to the effect of zebrafish eena overexpression (supplemental Fig. 3, white arrowheads). These results suggest that Eena and EEN proteins are functional orthologues. Morpholino Knockdown of eena Results in Significant Suppression of Myeloid Cells—To determine whether eena is required for zebrafish myeloid development, we first determined whether the eena MO was able to inhibit the synthesis of endogenous Eena protein by Western blot analysis. Microinjection of eena MO at the dose of 8 and 16 ng per embryo resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of Eena expression (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4), whereas injection of a 5-bp mismatch control MO demonstrated an appropriate levels of Eena protein as wild-type control (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2).

https://openalex.org/W2014166160,"Human vision is vital in determining our interaction with the outside world. In this study we characterize our ability to judge changes in the direction of motion of objects-a common task which can allow us either to intercept moving objects, or else avoid them if they pose a threat.Observers were presented with objects which moved across a computer monitor on a linear path until the midline, at which point they changed their direction of motion, and observers were required to judge the direction of change. In keeping with the variety of objects we encounter in the real world, we varied characteristics of the moving stimuli such as velocity, extent of motion path and the object size. Furthermore, we compared performance for moving objects with the ability of observers to detect a deviation in a line which formed the static trace of the motion path, since it has been suggested that a form of static memory trace may form the basis for these types of judgment. The static line judgments were well described by a 'scale invariant' model in which any two stimuli which possess the same two-dimensional geometry (length/width) result in the same level of performance. Performance for the moving objects was entirely different. Irrespective of the path length, object size or velocity of motion, path deviation thresholds depended simply upon the duration of the motion path in seconds.Human vision has long been known to integrate information across space in order to solve spatial tasks such as judgment of orientation or position. Here we demonstrate an intriguing mechanism which integrates direction information across time in order to optimize the judgment of path deviation for moving objects."
https://openalex.org/W2028342113,"HIV-1 exhibits a high degree of genetic diversity and is presently divided into 3 distinct HIV-1 genetic groups designated major (M), non-M/non-O (N) and outlier (O). Group M, which currently comprises 9 subtypes (A-D, F-H, J and K), at least 34 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and several unique recombinant forms (URFs) is responsible for most of the HIV-1 epidemic. Most of the current knowledge of HIV-1 central nervous system (CNS) infection is based on subtype B. However, subtypes other than subtype B account for the majority of global HIV-1 infections. Therefore, we investigated whether subtypes have any influence on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of HIV-1 CNS infection.CSF HIV-1 RNA, CSF neopterin and CSF white blood cell (WBC) count were measured in patients infected with different HIV-1 subtypes. Using multivariate regression analysis, no differences in the CSF WBC count, neopterin and viral load were found between various HIV-1 subtypes.We did not find any subtype-dependent differences in the markers evaluated in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2018259450,"The ostracod family Cylindroleberididae is based on the genus Cylindroleberis Brady, 1868, and has a complicated nomenclatural history. The type species of Cylindroleberis is Cypridina mariae Baird, 1850. Baird described only the carapace, which had been considered lost. Thus, there was no reference point for the concept C. mariae or the genus Cylindroleberis. Baird's material has now been found in the Natural History Museum, London, U.K., and is illustrated here. To clarify the taxonomic status of C. mariae and Cylindroleberis, specimens were obtained from near the type locality, and a supplementary description is presented. This includes description of appendages, particularly the first antenna and mandible, which contain important diagnostic characters. This supplementary description provides important information about C. mariae, allowing a revision of the genus Cylindroleberis, and establishing a framework for future biological research on this ostracod group."
