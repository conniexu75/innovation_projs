https://openalex.org/W2154128645,"By analyzing the effects of single base substitutions around the ATG initiator codon in a cloned preproinsulin gene, I have identified ACCATGG as the optimal sequence for initiation by eukaryotic ribosomes. Mutations within that sequence modulate the yield of proinsulin over a 20-fold range. A purine in position -3 (i.e., 3 nucleotides upstream from the ATG codon) has a dominant effect; when a pyrimidine replaces the purine in position -3, translation becomes more sensitive to changes in positions -1, -2, and +4. Single base substitutions around an upstream, out-of-frame ATG codon affect the efficiency with which it acts as a barrier to initiating at the downstream start site for preproinsulin. The optimal sequence for initiation defined by mutagenesis is identical to the consensus sequence that emerged previously from surveys of translational start sites in eukaryotic mRNAs. The mechanism by which nucleotides flanking the ATG codon might exert their effect is discussed."

The smooth muscle relaxant papaverine did not attenuate the response; therefore, such reductions in diameter probably reflect a structural modification of the arterial wall rather than sustained contraction of smooth muscle. This arterial response to reduced blood flow was abolished when the endothelium was removed from the vessels. It appears that the endothelium is essential for the compensatory arterial response to long-term changes in luminal blood flow rates."
https://openalex.org/W2154989771,"A shortened form of the self-splicing ribosomal RNA (rRNA) intervening sequence of Tetrahymena thermophila acts as an enzyme in vitro. The enzyme catalyzes the cleavage and rejoining of oligonucleotide substrates in a sequence-dependent manner with Km = 42 microM and kcat = 2 min-1. The reaction mechanism resembles that of rRNA precursor self-splicing. With pentacytidylic acid as the substrate, successive cleavage and rejoining reactions lead to the synthesis of polycytidylic acid. Thus, the RNA molecule can act as an RNA polymerase, differing from the protein enzyme in that it uses an internal rather than an external template. At pH 9, the same RNA enzyme has activity as a sequence-specific ribonuclease."
https://openalex.org/W2044539033,"Downstream of the transcription start site in the Drosophila heat-shock gene hsp22, we have identified a region that is necessary for efficient transcription, and also for selective translation during heat shock. We assayed the expression of mutated genes after P-factor-mediated insertion into the genome. Deletions within the first 26 nucleotides block the preferential translation of hsp22 mRNA at high temperature. The rate of transcription is also decreased, though transcription is still heat-inducible. Leaving this region intact, up to 86% of the leader can be deleted without affecting translation or transcription. The functional region coincides with a region of sequence homology between the heat-shock genes. Only partial homology is found to a conserved sequence, ATCAGTTCT, found at the very 5' end of other insect genes."

Amplification of c-myc occurred in advanced, widespread tumors or in aggressive primary tumors. Apparent allelic deletions of c-rasHa and c-myb can be correlated with progression and metastasis of carcinomas and sarcomas."

https://openalex.org/W1987160102,"In the absence of VA RNAI, protein synthesis in adenovirus-infected HeLa cells fails because of defective initiation. Earlier work showed that the defect results from phosphorylation of the initiation factor elF-2 on its alpha subunit. We have identified the protein kinase responsible as the dsRNA-activated inhibitor of protein synthesis (DAI). DAI is present in uninfected state. It is activated in cells infected with the adenovirus mutant Ad5 dl331, which produces no VA RNAI, but not in cells infected with wild-type virus. Activation occurs during the late phase of infection with the mutant virus, and the activator appears to be dsRNA produced by symmetrical transcription of the viral genome. VA RNAI antagonizes the activation of DAI by dsRNA, but it cannot inhibit the activity of DAI once activated. We propose a mechanism for VA RNAI action based on its partially double-stranded nature."
https://openalex.org/W1981008066,"The presence of covalent DNA chemical addition products (adducts) in human term placentas was investigated by recently developed immunologic and 32P-postlabeling assays. DNA from placental specimens of smokers showed a small but not statistically significant increase in adduct levels when tested by antibodies to DNA modified with a benzo[a]pyrene dihydrodiol epoxide (BPDE-I), the ultimate carcinogenic derivative of benzo[a]pyrene. The postlabeling assay detected several modified nucleotides, one of which (adduct 1) strongly related to maternal smoking during pregnancy. This adduct was present in placental tissue from 16 of 17 smokers, but only 3 of 14 nonsmokers. Among smokers, levels of adduct 1 in general were only weakly related to questionnaire and biochemical measures of the intensity of smoking exposures, which suggests modulation by individual susceptibility factors. The adduct seemed to be derived from an aromatic carcinogen, but it may not result from several of the most intensely studied polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or aromatic amines in tobacco smoke. The data show the association of cigarette smoking with covalent damage to human DNA in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2089625974,"The cyclic (1----2)-beta-D-glucans produced by species of Agrobacterium and Rhizobium resemble the membrane-derived oligosaccharides of Escherichia coli in their periplasmic localization, intermediate size, and (1----2)-beta-D-glucan backbones. The regulation of the biosynthesis of cyclic (1----2)-beta-D-glucan by Agrobacterium tumefaciens is now shown to parallel the osmotic regulation of membrane-derived oligosaccharide biosynthesis in Escherichia coli. This result suggests a general role for periplasmic oligosaccharides in the osmotic adaptation of Gram-negative bacteria as ecologically diverse as enteric and soil bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2057885570,"Human probes identifying the cellular homologs of the v-ets gene, Hu-ets-1 and Hu-ets-2, and two panels of rodent-human cell hybrids were used to study specific translocations occurring in acute leukemias. The human ets-1 gene was found to translocate from chromosome 11 to 4 in the t(4;11)(q21;23), a translocation characteristic of a subtype of leukemia that represents the expansion of a myeloid/lymphoid precursor cell. Similarly, the human ets-2 gene was found to translocate from chromosome 21 to chromosome 8 in the t(8;21)(q22;q22), a nonrandom translocation commonly found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia with morphology M2 (AML-M2). Both translocations are associated with expression different from the expression in normal lymphoid cells of ets genes, raising the possibility that these genes play a role in the pathogenesis of these leukemias."
https://openalex.org/W1974960974,"The proximate mechanisms underlying mating behavior in naturally occurring species can be fundamentally different from those in more commonly studied laboratory and domesticated forms. In naturally occurring species, reproductive strategies are much more diverse, and mechanisms controlling behavior are correspondingly diverse. A variety of hormonal, environmental, and social cues can be used to activate mating behavior. Which cues are used by particular species depends on differences in environmental and physiological constraints imposed by particular reproductive strategies. Study of this diversity of mechanisms promises to identify specific selective forces that have shaped their evolution. This evolutionary perspective leads to widely applicable generalizations and provides a useful context within which to conceptualize differences between species, populations, and individuals."
https://openalex.org/W1492241928,"Insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II) were prepared from fetal calf serum and adult bovine serum by gel filtration, immunoaffinity chromatography, chromatofocusing, and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and their complete amino acid sequences determined. IGF-I and -II are found in both adult and fetal serum. The sequence of bovine IGF-I is found to be identical to that of human IGF-I, whereas 3 out of 67 amino acid residues are found to be different between bovine and human IGF-II. The differences are located in the C-peptide region of the molecule. Bovine IGF-II shows less than 10% immunological cross-reactivity with antisera against human and rat IGF-II, but is equipotent to human IGF-II in displacing human 125I-labeled IGF-II from human placental receptor. Bovine IGF-I was equipotent to human IGF-I in both radioimmunoassays and radioreceptor assays within the limits of the assay."
https://openalex.org/W2018905233,"The cytoplasmically synthesized precursor of the mitochondrial matrix enzyme, ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), is directed to mitochondria by its amino-terminal leader peptide. To define the critical residues and/or regions in the OTC leader peptide, we have synthesized OTC precursors with alterations in the leader portion. Analysis of deletions reveals that the middle portion of the 32 residue leader peptide is absolutely required for both mitochondrial uptake and proteolytic processing, whereas NH2-terminal and penultimate COOH-terminal portions are not. Analysis of precursors with single substitutions revealed complete loss of function when arginine 23 was substituted with glycine. Additional substitutions suggested that the critical role of this arginine residue may be mediated by participation in a local secondary structure, very likely an α-helix, which is proposed to be an essential element in the midportion of the leader peptide."
https://openalex.org/W2062104167,"Conditions are described for programming with active transcription complexes essentially all the Xenopus 5S RNA genes added to an extract of Xenopus oocyte nuclei. We call this rate enhancement. Transcription by SP6 RNA polymerase of either strand of a Xenopus 5S RNA gene is unimpeded by the presence of a complete transcription complex associated with the internal control region of the gene. Furthermore, the transcription complex remains stably associated with the 5S RNA gene following multiple transits by the prokaryotic polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1971555118,"A 1984 study of biotechnology companies reveals that nearly one-half of all such firms fund research in universities. Industry may support as much as one-quarter of all biotechnology research in institutions of higher education. These investments seem to be yielding substantial benefits to involved firms. Per dollar invested, university research is generating more patent applications than is other company research. Research relationships do pose some risks to traditional university values such as openness of communication among scholars. These risks may be greater in relationships involving small firms. The data also reveal that government is now, and seems likely to remain, the principal source of support for university research in biotechnology."
https://openalex.org/W2056478819,"Evidence is presented that the male sterility produced by the mouse t-complex is due to interaction of at least three sterility factors. These factors are carried in the same partial haplotypes as the three distorter genes, Tcd-1, Tcd-2, and Tcd-3 and are suggested to be identical with them. When heterozygous, the distorter/sterility genes act on the wild-type form of the responder gene, rendering sperm carrying it nonfunctional, thus leading to high transmission of the t form of the responder. When homozygous, the harmful effects of the distorter genes are stronger and affect both forms of the responder, leading to sterility. If homozygous sterility is an inescapable part of ratio distortion, then the t-lethals confer a selective advantage in removing sterile males from the population. Thus, the relationship between the various properties of the t-complex can now be understood."
https://openalex.org/W2143201493,"When single cells were allowed to attach to circular islands of adhesive substratum, their proliferation was strongly dependent on island area over the range 500 micron2 to 5000 micron2. The number of freshly explanted whole mouse embryo fibroblasts that performed DNA synthesis corresponded closely with a simple geometrical measure of area of cell surface exposed to the medium: freely suspended cells were only slightly less stimulated than attached cells exposing an equal surface area; hemispherical cells were less stimulated than cells of any other shape. In contrast, 3T3 cells were stimulated sixfold by islands too small to allow any increase in area. These experiments show that anchorage can stimulate by two different mechanisms. They offer a general method of measuring substrate contact stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2044845657,"When do ectodermal cells become specified to form epidermis, that is, become committed to form epidermis when isolated? Animal pole explants of Xenopus cultured in saline from the 8-cell stage onwards express a specific epidermal antigen, whereas vegetal explants do not. The isolated outer layer of ectoderm formed by stage 7 is almost completely specified, the inner layer is only partially so. When are cell associations and cell divisions necessary for epidermal differentiation? Embryos that were either disaggregated or incubated in cytochalasin B after the midblastula stage do not require cell interactions, Ca2+, or cell divisions for epidermal differentiation to occur. Inhibition of mRNA transcription with actinomycin D shows that the epidermal antigen is certainly transcribed by the late gastrula stage (stage 12)."
https://openalex.org/W1982182492,"The dynamics of the attachment of lymphocytes to the endothelium of high endothelial venules in murine Peyer's patches were studied in vivo. Lymphocytes adhered readily to the endothelium lining these vessels, but most of the adhering cells detached within a few seconds. Many lymphocytes, however, experienced multiple collisions with the high endothelial venules, and this substantially increased the efficiency of lymphocyte collection by these vessels."
https://openalex.org/W1993395125,"The X. laevis ribosomal DNA spacer contains duplicated RNA polymerase I ""spacer promoters"" and an array of repeated 60/81 bp promoter-related sequences. The latter have been shown to enhance transcription from a 40S preribosomal RNA promoter in cis. Here we present evidence that at least one spacer promoter is also necessary for efficient enhancement. Deletion of the spacer promoter sequences in a construct carrying only one such promoter reduces 40S RNA transcription to approximately 10% of wild type. This effect apparently is caused by inactivation of the spacer promoter, since mutants in which 4-177 bp of the spacer promoter and adjacent sequences are deleted are functionally equivalent. Spacer promoters and 60/80 bp arrays therefore probably act together to enhance 40S pre-RNA transcription in X. laevis."

https://openalex.org/W2075064801,"In the green alga Volvox carteri, heat shock had an unusual and adaptive effect mediated by induced production of a well-defined effector molecule. Females of this species normally reproduce asexually in the absence of a potent sexual inducer produced by mature sexual males, but they generated egg-bearing sexual daughters after a brief exposure to elevated temperatures. This response involved an ""autoinduction"" of sexuality, in which heat-shocked somatic cells made and released the sexual inducer, which then redirected development of the reproductive cells. Males, including a sterile mutant incapable of producing inducer in the usual manner, also produced the inducer in response to heat shock. The phenomenon probably is of significance in the wild, where Volvox reproduces asexually in temporary ponds in spring but becomes sexual and produces dormant, overwintering zygotes before the ponds dry up in the summer heat."
https://openalex.org/W1567044991,"Residues 89-100 of troponin C (C89-100) and 96-116 of troponin I (I96-116) interact with each other in the troponin complex (Dalgarno, D.C., Grand, R.J.A., Levine, B.A. Moir, A., J.G., Scott, G.M.M., and Perry, S.V. (1982) FEBS Lett. 150, 54-58) and are necessary for the Ca2+ sensitivity of actomyosin ATPase (Syska, H., Wilkinson, J.M., Grand, R.J.A., and Perry, S.V. (1976) Biochem. J. 153, 375-387 and Grabarek, Z., Drabikowski, W., Leavis, P.C., Rosenfeld, S.S., and Gergely, J. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 13121-13127). We have studied Ca2+-induced changes in the region C89-100 by monitoring the fluorescence of troponin C (TnC) labeled at Cys-98 with 5-(iodoacetamidoethyl)aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid. Equilibrium titration of the labeled TnC with Ca2+ indicates that the probe is sensitive to binding to both classes of sites in free TnC as well as in its complex with TnI. When Mg2 X TnC is mixed with Ca2+ in a stopped flow apparatus, there is a rapid fluorescence increase related to Ca2+ binding to the unoccupied sites I and II followed by a slower increase (k = 9.9 s-1) that represents Mg2+-Ca2+ exchange at sites III and IV. In the TnC X TnI complex, the fast phase is much larger and the Mg2+-Ca2+ exchange at sites III and IV results in a small decrease rather than an increase in the fluorescence of the probe. The possibility is discussed that the fast change in the environment of Cys-98 upon Ca2+ binding to sites I and II may be instrumental in triggering activation of the thin filament by facilitating a contact between C89-100 and I96-116."
https://openalex.org/W1521901796,"The cell surface glycoprotein of Halobacteria contains two different types of sulfated saccharides: hexuronic acid-containing oligosaccharides linked to the protein via asparaginylglucose, and a serially repeated saccharide unit containing amino sugars that resembles the animal glycosaminoglycans. Here we report that 1) the sulfated repeating unit saccharide is linked to the cell surface glycoprotein via asparaginyl-N-acetylgalactosamine, 2) the amino acid sequence surrounding this linkage region is -Asn-Ala-Ser-, and thus in agreement with the acceptor sequence ASN-X-Thr(Ser) common to all eucaryotic N-glycosidically bound saccharides determined so far; 3) in addition to galactose, galacturonic acid, N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acetylgalactosamine, the methylated hexuronic acid 3-O-methylgalacturonic acid occurs as a stoichiometric constituent of the sulfated building block of the glycosaminoglycan chain."
https://openalex.org/W1557258457,"Thrombospondin (TSP) is a trace protein in plasma but is released in high concentrations from alpha-granules of activated platelets during hemostasis. It binds to the platelet membrane and becomes incorporated into fibrin clots. A variety of approaches were taken to learn the effects of TSP on fibrin polymerization and structure. 125I-TSP and 125I-fibrinogen were used to study the effect of TSP concentration on the extent of TSP and fibrin incorporation. Turbidity at 600 nm was used to monitor the time course of polymerization. Wavelength dependence of the turbidity was used to calculate the mass to length ratio, fiber diameter, and fiber density of fibrin formed in the presence and absence of TSP. Morphologies of control and TSP-containing clots were examined by electron microscopy following critical point drying. The initial TSP concentration influenced the amount of TSP incorporated but did not alter the extent of fibrin polymerization. TSP, in a concentration-dependent manner, reduced the lag time to turbidity rise and caused formation of more numerous but thinner fibers. Except for their diameter, these fibers were identical to fibers of control fibrin in terms of density and morphology. It is proposed that TSP interacts with fibrin intermediates to accelerate fiber growth, perhaps by serving as a trifunctional branching unit during network formation. The properties of fibrin around aggregating platelets, therefore, may be influenced considerably by secreted TSP."
https://openalex.org/W1584839731,"Simple inhibition studies in which fractional velocity is measured as a function of inhibitor concentration were used to distinguish heterodimeric from homodimeric isoenzymes of glutathione transferase. Homodimeric isoenzymes from rat, mouse, and human tissues were shown to give graphs of fractional velocity versus the logarithm of inhibitor concentration that were characterized by a sigmoid curve shape and a maximal slope of -0.58 at 50% inhibition, characteristic for linear inhibition of monomeric or non-cooperative oligomeric enzymes. In contrast, inhibition curves for heterodimeric isoenzymes from rat liver displayed significant deviations from these characteristics. The basis for the identification of heterodimers was the finding that the kinetic properties of subunits were additive such that the inhibition curve of a heterodimeric isoenzyme could be predicted from those of the corresponding homodimers. The method should be valuable in the differentiation between the multiple forms of glutathione transferase in tissues not previously characterized. It is suggested that the method should be applicable for discrimination also in other isoenzyme families consisting of oligomeric structures of identical and nonidentical subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1605813385,"[5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H8]Leukotriene C4 was subcutaneously injected into rats. Substantial amounts of the administered radioactivity were excreted in feces of germ-free and conventional animals during a 72-h period (78 and 64%, respectively). Analyses of fecal extracts by high performance liquid chromatography showed eight radioactive components for each type of animal. One metabolite amounted to 4.6% of the injected radioactivity in germ-free and 0.6% in conventional rats. Its chemical structure, 5-hydoxy-6-S-(2-acetamido-3-thiopropionyl)-7,9-trans-11,14-c is-eicosatetraenoi c acid (N-acetylleukotriene E4) was determined by ultraviolet spectroscopy, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, chemical and enzymatic transformations, and confirmed by chemical synthesis. Another metabolite (2.7% of the administered radioactivity in germ-free and 0.5% in conventional rats) was characterized as the 11-trans isomer of the former metabolite. The pathway of formation of these compounds appears to be analogous to the pathway of mercapturic acid biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1531073921,"Abstract Two single-stranded nucleic acid-binding proteins, UP1 and UP2, that were originally reported by Herrick and Alberts (Herrick, G., and Alberts, B. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 2124-2132) have been purified to apparent homogeneity from calf thymus by high performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequence of UP1 (Williams, K. R., Stone, K. L., LoPresti, M. B., Merrill, B. M., and Planck, S. R. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 5666-5670) reveals that UP1 contains 195 amino acids, including one dimethylarginine residue near its COOH terminus. Further analysis of this sequence now demonstrates that UP1 contains a 91-residue internal repeat such that when residues 3-93 (the A region) are aligned with residues 94-194 (the B region), 32% of the amino acids in these two regions are identical and an additional 39% of those changes that are seen could be accomplished by single base changes. The high degree of internal homology between residues 51-61 and 143-152 and in particular the high density of aromatic and positively charged amino acids in these two regions suggest that residues 51-61 and 143-152 may constitute two independent DNA-binding sites. Solid-phase sequencing of three tryptic peptides that together account for 9% of the 39,500-dalton UP2 protein demonstrate that there is a high degree of sequence homology between UP1 and UP2. Of the 34 residues that have been sequenced in UP2, 44% are identical in both UP1 and UP2. The blocked NH2 terminus, amino acid composition, particularly with regard to its high glycine content and the presence of dimethylarginine, and molecular weight of UP2 suggest this protein is related to proteins that have previously been found associated with heterogeneous RNA. Taken together, these data indicate that both UP1 and UP2 belong to a new family of single-stranded nucleic acid-binding proteins that may be closely related to heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1608569514,"We reported previously that certain cerebrosides and ceramides from fungi were active upon fruiting of Schizophyllum commune (Kawai, G., and Ikeda, Y. (1982) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 719, 612-618; Kawai, G., and Ikeda, Y. (1983) (Biochim. Biophys. Acta 754, 243-248). This work was undertaken to extend our study to sphingolipids in wheat grain. The cerebrosides from wheat grain were fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography into at least 40 components with and without the fruiting-inducing activity. Four major active fractions were characterized by thin-layer chromatography, infrared spectroscopy, gas-liquid chromatography, gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy, and 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The active cerebrosides consist of glucose, 2-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid or 2-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid acid, and (4E,8Z)-sphingadienine or (8Z)-sphingenine. The cerebroside with (8Z)-sphingenine became inactive when the double bond was hydrogenated. Diglycosylceramides were as active as the monoglycosylceramides, but triglycosylceramides were only about 10% as active. The relationship between the structure and the activity is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1516030147,"The expression of a vascular smooth muscle specific alpha-actin isoform can be induced in mouse BC3H1 smooth muscle cells by treating confluent monolayers with serum-free medium (Strauch, A. R., and Rubenstein, P. A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3152-3159; 7224-7229). Using blot hybridization techniques, two size classes of actin RNA were identified in BC3H1 cells with the relative amount of RNA in each size class varying according to the developmental state of the cells; a 2100-nucleotide actin RNA was most abundant in myoblasts, whereas a smaller 1500-nucleotide actin RNA was found predominantly in fully differentiated myocytes. Results of in vitro translation experiments suggested that the 2100-nucleotide actin RNA on blots of myoblast total RNA corresponded to a mixture of similar size transcripts encoding both beta- and gamma-actin, while the 1500-nucleotide actin RNA in myocytes was an alpha-actin mRNA. Cell-cell contact and serum withdrawal initiated a 6-fold increase in the level of alpha-actin mRNA in BC3H1 cells that was followed by a 3-fold decrease in the amount of beta- and gamma-actin mRNA when confluent cells were exposed to serum-free medium for prolonged periods. Vascular smooth muscle alpha-actin was the major alpha-actin isoform synthesized in L-[35S]cysteine-labeled BC3H1 myocytes, indicating that the 1500-nucleotide actin mRNA size class in these cells may be enriched for vascular smooth muscle alpha-actin transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W2120292813,"An (ADP-ribose)n glycohydrolase has been purified more than 3,000-fold from guinea pig liver nuclei with an 18% yield. The glycohydrolase activity present in the nuclei was solubilized only by sonication at high ionic strength and purified by sequential chromatographic steps on phosphocellulose, DEAE-cellulose, Blue Sepharose, and single-stranded DNA cellulose. The purified protein exhibited one predominant protein band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with an estimated molecular weight of 75,500. On Sephadex G-100 gel filtration, single coincident peaks of (ADP-ribose)n glycohydrolase activity and protein with a molecular weight value of 72,000 were observed. The Km value for (ADP-ribose)n and the maximal velocity of the highly purified glycohydrolase were 2.3 microM and 36 mumol of ADP-ribose released from (ADP-ribose)n . min-1 . mg protein-1, respectively. Hydrolysis of (ADP-ribose)n by the enzyme was exoglycosidic in nature. The optimum pH for the enzyme activity was apparent at 6.8-7.0. Sulfhydryl compounds and monovalent cations were required for the maximal activity. The enzyme was sensitive to Ca2+ but not to Mg2+. The enzyme activity was inhibited by ADP-ribose, cyclic AMP (adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate) and diadenosine 5',5'''-p1,p4-tetraphosphate. Denatured DNA and histones were inhibitory, but native DNA and its histone complex were not inhibitory. Our data indicate that the glycohydrolase is present only as a minor protein in nuclei, being present in perhaps about 50,000 molecules/nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1577075831,"The incorporation of tritiated fatty acids into proteins has been studied in cell-free extracts from mouse tissues. Incubation of heart extracts with [3H]tetradecanoic or [3H]palmitic acid in the presence of ATP and CoA resulted in the time-dependent and selective labeling of proteins (Mr = 60,000, 47,000, 42,000, 31,000, 16,000, and 13,000) which could be detected after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Two polypeptides (Mr = 47,000 and 42,000) reached a maximum in fatty acid incorporation very rapidly and were mainly localized in the membrane subcellular fractions of the extract. These proteins underwent transient labeling with [3H] tetradecanoyl-CoA, the maximum incorporation being obtained within 1 min. The fatty acid-labeled proteins from tissue extracts had the same properties as other proteins known to be acylated in intact cells, i.e. the acyl moiety was resistant to delipidation with organic solvents but could be hydrolyzed by treatment with neutral hydroxylamine. Screening of different tissues showed that extracts from liver and kidney also catalyze the ATP- and CoA-dependent formation of a similar group of fatty acid-acylated proteins. The results provide evidence for a group of proteins in mammalian tissues which selectively incorporate fatty acids in vitro and should be of value for further studies on the biosynthesis of acylated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2070956299,"A semisterile male translocation heterozygote [t(2; 14) 1Gso] that exhibited neurological symptoms and an inability to swim (diver) was found among the offspring of male mice treated with triethylenemelamine. All breeding and cytogenetic data showed a complete concordance between translocation heterozygosity and the neurological disorders. Homozygosity for the translocation seemed to be lethal at an early embryonic stage. Despite the distinctive neurologic symptoms, no anatomic or histological defects in either the ear or in the central nervous system were observed. Thus, a balanced chromosomal translocation can produce disease with an inheritance pattern that mimics a single dominant gene defect."
https://openalex.org/W1563902804,"The interaction of 20-, 23-, and 25-hydroperoxy derivatives of cholesterol with various heme proteins, including the cholesterol side-chain-cleaving enzyme, cytochrome P-450scc, was studied by means of product and spectral analyses. Quasi-Fenton homolytic decomposition via intermediate alkoxy radicals appears to prevail during nonspecific interaction. Highly stereospecific hydroperoxide-driven hydroxylations suggest the absence of free radical species and are interpreted as resulting from a heterolytic type of peroxide decomposition or, alternatively, homolytic decomposition assuming proximal base effect to stabilize a putative intermediate alkoxy radical. Spectral aberrations during the early stages of the latter interaction indicate formation of a ternary iron-peroxo-substrate complex. Decomposition of this complex results in multiple product formation suggesting that peroxide cleavage reverts to regular homolytic decomposition upon denaturation of the enzyme. The implications of these observations for the mechanism of hydroxylation and oxidative carbon-carbon bond scission during enzymic side-chain cleavage of cholesterol are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1574749852,"We have used purified protease nexin-I (PN-I) from human fibroblasts to develop a polyclonal antibody that specifically blocks the PN-I-mediated cellular binding of thrombin and urokinase. Anti-PN-I IgG did not inhibit the binding of 125I-epidermal growth factor-binding protein to fibroblasts, which is mediated by protease nexin-II, another cell-secreted, serine protease inhibitor that is distinct from PN-I. This furthers the belief that the protease nexins are distinct from one another. In addition, while anti-PN-I IgG immunoprecipitated PN-I X thrombin complexes, it did not do so with antithrombin-III X thrombin. Metabolically labeled PN-I was also immunoprecipitated by IgG, indicating that the protein can be labeled in vivo. The antibody also recognized primarily one band on Western transfers of conditioned medium from fibroblast cultures. These results suggest that anti-PN-I will be useful in probing the physiological role of PN-I as well as its biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1557260097,"Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase and guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activities are essential for the supply of guanine nucleotides in Schistosoma mansoni schistosomules. In crude extracts of adult S. mansoni, these two activities co-elute in size exclusion, ion exchange, and chromatofocusing chromatography and exhibit similar stabilities to heat treatment, suggesting that they are associated in one enzyme protein hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. This enzyme has been purified by a combination of heat treatment at 85 degrees C and chromatofocusing chromatography with elution at an apparent pI of 5.27 +/- 0.15. Pore gradient electrophoresis of the native enzyme followed by subsequent activity staining demonstrate an enzyme molecular weight of 105,000. The activity staining pattern remains the same whether hypoxanthine or guanine is used as the substrate, further supporting the existence of a single protein, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified protein results in a single protein band with a subunit molecular weight estimate of 64,000, suggesting that the native enzyme is a dimer. Preliminary kinetic studies showed that the purified hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase reacted with guanine at a rate twice as fast as it did with hypoxanthine, but it did not act on xanthine at all. A full-length mouse neuroblastoma hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase cDNA clone pHPT5 and a plasmid pSV2-gpt containing the xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene for Escherichia coli were utilized as probes on Southern blots of S. mansoni DNA digests, and no significant hybridization was found under relatively relaxed conditions. Polyclonal antibodies made against human erythrocyte hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and E. coli xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase were tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of S. mansoni protein extracts, and no detectable cross-reacting protein was found. S. mansoni hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase thus may bear rather limited homology to mammalian hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase or bacterial xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and could be an attractive target for antischistosomal chemotherapeutic drug design."
https://openalex.org/W1502846265,"The inactivation of the renal outer cortical brush-border membrane D-glucose transporter by the covalent carboxyl reagent N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) is studied by monitoring its effects on sodium-dependent phlorizin binding to the active site of the carrier. In the presence of EEDQ, this component of phlorizin binding decreases exponentially and irreversibly with time. The order of this inactivation reaction is very close to 1, indicating that EEDQ modifies the transporter at a single essential site. This site can be partially protected by glucose and by other substrates of the transporter and completely protected by phlorizin, a nontransported competitive inhibitor. By contrast, sodium, a co-transported activator, has no protective effect. The concentration dependence of the protection provided by glucose and phlorizin indicates that the site of action of EEDQ is at or closely related to the substrate binding site on the carrier. The effects of EEDQ on the transporter are mimicked by another carboxyl specific reagent, 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate. The rate of inactivation of the transporter by EEDQ increases dramatically with decreasing pH, consistent with the hypothesis that the rate-limiting step in the inactivation process is a reaction with an essential carboxyl group. The properties of this group indicate, however, that it is distinct from the carboxyl group proposed by others as forming (a part of) the sodium binding site of sodium-coupled sugar carriers."
https://openalex.org/W1555821057,"Purified dog plasma apo-E is composed of four major isoforms with the following pI values: 5.40, 5.31, 5.26, and 5.22. Treatment with neuraminidase suggests that the multiple forms are due to progressive sialation. The acidic isoforms (pI = 5.22 and less), rarely detectable in plasma lipoprotein samples (except in the d less than 1.05 g/ml fraction of cholesterol-fed dogs), are present in high concentrations in the interstitial fluid high density lipoprotein fraction I (HDLI) of cholesterol-fed dogs, a lipoprotein recently described (Dory, L., Boquet, L.M., Hamilton, R.L., Sloop, C.H., and Roheim, P.S. (1985) J. Lipid Res. 26, 519-527). Apo-Es0 (the most basic isoform) is a major constituent of the plasma d less than 1.05 g/ml fraction, but it is usually only a minor component of other plasma or interstitial fluid lipoproteins. This is likely a reflection of the prolonged residence time of a specific lipoprotein species in this density range, resulting in more extensive desialation. Peripheral apo-E synthesis has been measured under in vivo conditions using a hindlimb cannulation of the lymphatics and collection of prenodal peripheral lymph. Following injection of [3H]leucine or [35S]methionine into the dorsal skin of the toes, the specific activity of the interstitial fluid apo-E far exceeded that of plasma apo-E at all time points examined. Incorporation was measurable 30 min after the isotope injection and peaked at 150 min in control dogs and between 120-150 min in cholesterol-fed dogs. The rate of peripheral synthesis of apo-E in cholesterol-fed dogs appeared to be twice that of control dogs. The newly synthesized and secreted apo-E preferentially associated with the disc-shaped HDLI of the interstitial fluid; less than 15% of the apo-E-associated radioactivity was recovered in the d less than 1.05 g/ml fraction, despite the fact that this fraction contains well over 50% of the total interstitial fluid apo-E mass. The newly secreted, HDLI-associated apo-E can be converted by neuraminidase into apo-Es0."
https://openalex.org/W1526665989,"Abstract The 32-amino acid form of the peptide hormone calcitonin is the product of a series of post-translational processing steps of a 13,400-dalton precursor, procalcitonin. We have now identified the steps involved in proteolytic paring of the precursor to the mature secretory form. Cultures of the CA-77 cell line were radiolabeled and the various forms of calcitonin were isolated by specific immunoprecipitation followed by fractionation on gel filtration and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Pulse-chase kinetics showed that procalcitonin was cleaved to a 6,500-dalton biosynthetic intermediate which was subsequently processed to the size of mature calcitonin (3,400 daltons). Partial microsequencing of the [35S] methionine-labeled intermediate indicated that the sequence consisted of the COOH-terminal 52 residues of procalcitonin. Partial microsequencing of the [35S]methionine- or [3H]proline-labeled 3,400-dalton species revealed that it was indistinguishable from naturally occurring, amidated calcitonin. These data define the major pathway for calcitonin biosynthesis in this neoplastic cell line and presumably in normal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1588846669,"Cobalt(II) ovotransferrin bicarbonate and oxalate ternary complexes were prepared and investigated in the pH range 7-10.5. Cobalt(II) provides an excellent and unique spectroscopic probe to monitor subtle structural differences in solution between the two sites of ovotransferrin and to investigate the structural dependence on pH. CD spectroscopy on one side and 1H NMR spectroscopy of isotropically shifted signals on the other are extremely sensitive techniques and are particularly suited for high spin cobalt(II)-containing compounds. In the case of the oxalate derivative the metal-binding ability of the protein is different at the two binding sites and is pH dependent; the CD spectra reveal two different sites, one of which is clearly pH dependent with a pKa of 9.5. On the contrary the bicarbonate analogue does not show any spectral difference between the two sites; both of them change with pH, the pKa being again 9.5. 1H NMR spectra of the oxalate derivatives at pH 7-8 reveal the presence of conformers, the distribution of which depends on the H2O/D2O ratio. Such conformers are not revealed in the bicarbonate system; at pH around 10 the NMR spectra of both systems show inequivalence between the two sites and/or the presence of different conformers for each site. Such differences are discussed in terms of the possible implications in mechanism and function. The overall spectral data are consistent with the donor groups being two histidines, two tyrosines, the synergistic anion, and possibly a solvent molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1973116123,"Retinal photoreceptor cell dystrophies have been widely observed in humans and in animals, but pathogenetic mechanisms are known in only a few such disorders, and successful therapeutic intervention has been reported in fewer still. Spontaneously hypertensive albino rats develop a retinal photoreceptor cell dystrophy with onset late in the first year or early in the second year of life. Between 60 and 70 percent of the animals are affected. A substantial reduction in the prevalence and severity of the dystrophy occurred in such animals whose diet contained 30 percent (by weight) D-galactose. Neither an inhibitor of the enzyme aldose reductase, present in the diet, nor diabetes mellitus, induced by streptozotocin, had any statistically significant influence on the dystrophy. Ambient light and systolic blood pressure levels also did not seem to influence the course of the disorder. The mechanism by which galactose exerts its effect is unknown, but a mutant enzyme with an elevated Michaelis constant (Km) for galactose is plausible."
https://openalex.org/W2050941009,"The binding of Mg2+ X adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Mg2+ X AMP-PNP) to rabbit skeletal myofibrils has been measured in aqueous solution and in 50% ethylene glycol in the presence and absence of Ca2+. In water, the observed binding was weak with less than half the calculated myosin active sites filled even at 1 mM Mg2+ X AMP-PNP. In 50% ethylene glycol, the binding is at least 100-fold tighter and extrapolates to the expected number of binding sites. This is contrasted to the small change seen for Mg2+ X ADP binding between the same sets of conditions. This difference between Mg2+ X AMP-PNP and Mg2+ X ADP is attributed to the strong coupling of Mg2+ X AMP-PNP binding to dissociation of myosin cross-bridges. The Ca2+ sensitivity of Mg2+ X AMP-PNP binding in 50% ethylene glycol is taken as further evidence of the thermodynamic coupling of Mg2+ X AMP-PNP binding to cross-bridge dissociation. In addition, the binding of Mg2+ X AMP-PNP in 50% ethylene glycol is biphasic while Mg2+ X ADP binding under the same conditions is not. The biphasic Mg2+ X AMP-PNP binding could be caused by either the presence of two or more classes of cross-bridges or by negative cooperativity, but the presence of only a single class of Mg2+ X ADP-binding sites implies that if multiple classes of sites are involved, they do not simply differ in steric hindrance or accessibility of the binding site as a whole. The importance of using purified AMP-PNP in the study of actomyosin X AMP-PNP complexes is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1594089559,"The effect of the plasma membrane potential delta psi p on the transport rate and steady state distribution of Li+ was assessed in rat cortical synaptosomes. Up to 15 mM Li+ failed to saturate Li+ influx into polarized synaptosomes in a Na+-based medium with 3 mM external K+. Veratridine increased and tetrodotoxin, ouabain, or high external K+ decreased the rate of Li+ influx. At steady state, Li+ was concentrated about 3-fold in resting synaptosomes at 0.3 to 1 mM Li+ externally. Subsequent depolarization of the plasma membrane by veratridine or high external K+ induced an immediate release of Li+. When graded depolarizations were imposed onto the plasma membrane by varying concentrations of ouabain, veratridine, or external K+, steady state distribution of Li+ was linearly related with K+ distribution or electrochemical activity coefficients. It was concluded that uptake rate and steady state distribution of Li+ depend significantly on delta psi p. However, Li+ gradients were lower than predicted from delta psi p, suggesting that (secondary) active transport systems counteracted passive equilibration by uphill extrusion of Li+. The electrochemical potential difference delta mu Li+ maintained at a delta psi p of -72 mV was calculated to 4.2 kJ/mol of Li+. At physiological external K+, Li+ was not actively transported by the sodium pump. The ouabain sensitivity resulted from the coupling of Li+ uptake to the pump-dependent K+ diffusion potential. In low K+ and K+-free media, however, active transport of Li+ by the sodium pump contributed to total uptake. In the absence of K+, Li+ substituted for K+ in generating a delta psi p of -64 mV maximally, as calculated from TPMP+ distribution at 40 mM external Li+. Since Li+ gradients were far too low to account for a diffusion potential, it was assumed that Li+ gave rise to an electrogenic pump potential."
https://openalex.org/W1499631732,"The (Rp)- and (Sp)-diastereoisomers of thymidyl 3'-(4-nitrophenyl phosphorothioate) (1) were found to act as unusual substrates for acid deoxyribonuclease (DNase II). Instead of the expected thymidine 3'-phosphorothioate, the product resulting from the reaction of (Rp)-1 catalyzed by DNase II was identified as (Sp, Rp)-thymidyl (3'-5')thymidyl phosphorothioate 3'-(4-nitrophenyl phosphorothioate), while that from (Sp)-1 has been recognized as a 10:1 mixture of (Sp, Rp)-thymidyl (3'-5')thymidyl phosphorothioate 5'-(4-nitrophenyl phosphorothioate) and (Rp, Sp)-thymidyl (3'-5')-thymidyl phosphorothioate 3'-(4-nitrophenyl phosphorothioate), respectively. Both types of transnucleotidylations were found to occur with retention of configuration at phosphorus. Stereochemical results may be interpreted in terms of two step mechanisms involving the formation of the intermediate, covalent substrate enzyme complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1560043352,"Abstract Change in chromatin structure of a developmentally regulated gene of Sarcophaga peregrina (flesh fly) during development was investigated. This gene (25-kDa protein gene) was specifically activated in the fat body, but not the hemocytes of larvae in the middle of the third instar. The mRNA level in the fat body decreased thereafter, reaching one-fifth of the maximum level in the late third instar to early pupal stage. In the chromatin of fat body nuclei, a DNase I-hypersensitive site was found about 300 base pairs upstream from the transcription initiation site of the 25-kDa protein gene. This DNase I-hypersensitive site appeared before activation of the 25-kDa protein gene, and it was conserved until the late third instar, but disappeared in the early pupal stage. Since activity of the 25-kDa protein gene decreases significantly in the early pupal stage, it is likely that disappearance of this DNase I-hypersensitive site coincides with inactivation of the 25-kDa protein gene."
