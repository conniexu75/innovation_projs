https://openalex.org/W1549679997,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine, which is involved in inflammatory and immune responses, acute phase reactions, and hematopoiesis. In the mouse fibrosarcoma cell line L929, the nuclear factor (NF)-κB plays a crucial role in IL-6 gene expression mediated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The levels of the activated factor do not, however, correlate with the variations of IL-6 gene transcription; therefore, other factors and/or regulatory mechanisms presumably modulate the levels of IL-6 mRNA production. Upon analysis of various deletion and point-mutated variants of the human IL-6 gene promoter coupled to a reporter gene, we screened for possible cooperating transcription factors. Even the smallest deletion variant, containing almost exclusively a NF-κB-responsive sequence preceding the IL-6 minimal promoter, as well as a recombinant construction containing multiple κB-motifs, could still be stimulated with TNF. We observed that the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB203580 was able to repress TNF-stimulated expression of the IL-6 gene, as well as of a κB-dependent reporter gene construct, without affecting the levels of NF-κB binding to DNA. Furthermore, we clearly show that, using a nuclear Gal4 “one-hybrid” system, the MAPK inhibitors SB203580 and PD0980589 have a direct repressive effect on the transactivation potential of the p65 κB subunit. Therefore, we conclude that, in addition to cytoplasmic activation and DNA binding of NF-κB, the p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK pathways act as necessary cooperative mechanisms to regulate TNF-induced IL-6 gene expression by modulating the transactivation machinery.

Among its many functions, IL-6 plays an active role in immunological responses, bone metabolism, reproduction, inflammation, neoplasia, and aging. The cellular and molecular biology of IL-6 has been explored by a variety of approaches (1Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Res. Immunol. 1992; 143: 689-788Google Scholar, 2Keller E.T. Wanagat J. Ershler W.B. Frontiers Biosci. 1996; 1: d340-d357Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The regulation of expression of the IL-6 gene is adapted to the key function of this cytokine, namely a systemic alarm signal that recruits diverse host defense mechanisms that serve to limit tissue injury. Inflammation-associated cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1, and platelet-derived growth factor, bacterial products such as endotoxin, and acute viral infections, all enhance IL-6 gene expression. The characterization of the IL-6 promoter revealed a complex control region that can be triggered by multiple activation pathways (3Dendorfer U. Oettgen P. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4443-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 4Haegeman G. Fiers W. Packer L. Wirtz K. Signalling Mechanisms: From Transcription Factors to Oxidative Stress. Springer Verlag, Berlin1995: 375-382Google Scholar).In the case of TNF (and of IL-1), the main transcriptional activator for IL-6 gene induction is the nuclear factor (NF)-κB (5Libermann T.A.

Biol. 1990; 10: 3818-3823Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), which is typically a dimer between p50 and the transactivating subunit p65 (RelA). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB resides in the cytoplasm. Here, the DNA-binding dimer is bound to the inhibitory molecule IκB, from which it is released upon cell stimulation. NF-κB then migrates into the nucleus, where it effects expression of its numerous target genes (8Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4582) Google Scholar).We have shown previously that in the mouse fibrosarcoma cell line L929sA, the quantities of activated NF-κB do not correlate with the variations of IL-6 mRNA levels in the cell. We therefore concluded that other cooperative factors or regulatory mechanisms are necessary for modulating the levels of NF-κB-dependent IL-6 mRNA production (9Patestos N.P. Haegeman G. Vandevoorde V. Fiers W. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Studies over the last few years have shown that different mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) cascade pathways contribute to the transmission of extracellular signals that can finally result in direct or indirect phosphorylation of various transcription factors and alterations in gene expression (10Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 11Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). More particularly, we reported that abrogation of the p38 MAPK pathway represses TNF-mediated IL-6 gene expression, but not NF-κB activation and DNA binding (12Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar).In the present article, we report on the essential role of NF-κB to trigger IL-6 gene activation in response to TNF in L929sA cells. Furthermore, we show that, apart from TNF-induced cytoplasmic NF-κB activation and nuclear DNA binding, the TNF-activated p38 and ERK MAPK pathways contribute to transcriptional activation by modulating the transactivation capacity of the NF-κB p65 subunit.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we have focused on the transcriptional activation by the factor NF-κB in response to TNF. By the use of various deleted and point-mutated versions of the IL-6 promoter, we have documented the key role of the κB motif for induction by TNF. A number of previous reports have already described the necessity of cooperation and association of NF-κB with other DNA-bound transcription factors for optimal gene activation (33Kaszubska W. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Ghersa P. DeRaemy-Schenk A.-M. Chen B.P.C. Hai T. DeLamarter J.F. Whelan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7180-7190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Matsusaka T. Fujikawa K.

The deletion analysis of the IL-6 promoter shows that such factors have indeed a co-activating and integrating function for full stimulation of the IL-6 promoter. However, using “loss-of-function” mutants of the IL-6 promoter, the crucial role of NF-κB is obvious, without the primary need for other associating DNA-bound factors. Using the “gain-of-function” approach by inserting multiple κB sites in front of an unresponsive promoter, the TNF response could be restored.Activation of NF-κB and its binding to DNA is, however, not sufficient for IL-6 gene activation by TNF; the requirement of additional activating mechanisms has already been described previously (4Haegeman G. Fiers W. Packer L. Wirtz K. Signalling Mechanisms: From Transcription Factors to Oxidative Stress. Springer Verlag, Berlin1995: 375-382Google Scholar, 9Patestos N.P. Haegeman G. Vandevoorde V. Fiers W. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). More particularly, recently, we have established the importance of the p38 MAPK pathway as a necessary mechanism for transcriptional activity of the IL-6 promoter (12Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Our present data with the nuclear fusion protein Gal4-p65 show that the basal constitutive transcriptional activity of NF-κB p65, but not that of another acidic transactivator like VP16, could be specifically enhanced by TNF, independently of effects involving the cytoplasmic activation of NF-κB. This increased transcriptional activity is the result of the activation of MAPK pathways by TNF. The p38 as well as the ERK MAPK pathway contribute to the specific up-regulation by TNF without affecting the basal TNF-independent activity. This suggests a signalization system of at least two steps from the TNF receptor to the gene, in which, first, NF-κB becomes activated in the cytoplasm by a IκBα-specific kinase, as recently reported (37Régnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar), and second, the “nuclear” transactivation potential of the DNA-bound complex is modulated by (an) additional phosphorylation event(s) via different TNF-activated MAPKs. Such a multilevel regulation allows fine tuning and/or gene specific modulation of the transcriptional activity.Whether MAPKs act directly on the p65 transcription activation complex, or via intermediate kinases, remains an open question. Nevertheless, byin vitro kinase assays it was shown that neither IκBα, nor the NF-κB DNA-binding subunits p50, nor the transactivating C-terminal half of p65 became phosphorylated by p38. However, it is still conceivable that, in vivo, a kinase downstream in the p38 and ERK pathways phosphorylates NF-κB subunits (38Wesselborg S. Bauer M.K.A. Vogt M. Schmitz M.L. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12422-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar).Furthermore, whether MAPK-dependent phosphorylation effectively takes place on the p65 subunit itself is also not proven. Evidence for phosphorylation-dependent regulation of NF-κB has already been reported by Naumann and Scheidereit (39Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), who found increased binding of NF-κB upon phosphorylation of the p65 subunit. Recently, Zhong and co-workers (40Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) showed a strongly increased transcriptional activity after phosphorylation of p65 on a consensus cAMP-dependent protein kinase site, which is located in the p65 Rel homology domain. However, since this site is clearly different and distinct from the p65 transactivation domains TA1 and TA2, our data point to another phosphorylation system. Schmitzet al. (21Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) also observed increased transcriptional activity upon treatment of HeLa cells with phorbol ester and suggested a possible phosphorylation in the p65 TA2 domain by a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism. It cannot, however, be excluded that different signals and/or stimuli converge into the same activation region of the p65 subunit.Recent data connect transcriptional activity of the κB p65 subunit with the versatile coactivator/cointegrator proteins p300 and CBP (41Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar,42Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J. Science. 1997; 275: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Extensive protein-protein interactions have been mapped between the N- and C-terminal regions of CBP/p300, and the C terminus of p65, containing both transactivation domains. Interestingly, since our results with the Gal4-p65 fusion proteins demonstrate a crucial role of these domains of p65 for TNF inducibility, the possible phosphorylation status of these domains in p65-CBP interaction may be of particular interest. Furthermore, the coactivator proteins CBP/p300 are subject themselves to phosphorylation control and were described as a nuclear target for S6 kinase pp90rsk and for cyclin-dependent kinases (43Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Other targets for MAPK phosphorylation are part of the RNA polymerase complex (28Bellier S. Dubois M.-F. Nishida E. Almouzni G. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1434-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 44Venetianer A. Dubois M.F. Nguyen V.T. Bellier S. Seo S.J. Bensaude O. Eur. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Since RNA polymerase II is constitutively associated with CBP/p300, interaction of the coactivator with NF-κB in the IL-6 promoter complex may efficiently recruit the polymerase complex, to trigger subsequent IL-6 gene expression (46Kee B.L. Arias J. Montminy M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2373-2375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).In summary, our data show that p38 and ERK MAPK signaling pathways constitute an additional level of gene regulation by the transcription factor NF-κB, more particularly of the p65 subunit, in response to TNF. Modulation of the p65 transactivation occurs in the nucleus and independent from IκB regulation, since it is faithfully reproduced with the Gal4 fusion proteins. However, whether in vivo the κB p65 subunit itself is a direct or indirect substrate of TNF-activated p38 and/or ERK MAPK pathways, or else is part of an integrated transcriptionally active complex, which is subject to modulation by MAPK phosphorylation, needs further study.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2373-2375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).In summary, our data show that p38 and ERK MAPK signaling pathways constitute an additional level of gene regulation by the transcription factor NF-κB, more particularly of the p65 subunit, in response to TNF. Modulation of the p65 transactivation occurs in the nucleus and independent from IκB regulation, since it is faithfully reproduced with the Gal4 fusion proteins. However, whether in vivo the κB p65 subunit itself is a direct or indirect substrate of TNF-activated p38 and/or ERK MAPK pathways, or else is part of an integrated transcriptionally active complex, which is subject to modulation by MAPK phosphorylation, needs further study. In this paper, we have focused on the transcriptional activation by the factor NF-κB in response to TNF. By the use of various deleted and point-mutated versions of the IL-6 promoter, we have documented the key role of the κB motif for induction by TNF. A number of previous reports have already described the necessity of cooperation and association of NF-κB with other DNA-bound transcription factors for optimal gene activation (33Kaszubska W. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Ghersa P. DeRaemy-Schenk A.-M. Chen B.P.C. Hai T. DeLamarter J.F. Whelan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7180-7190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Matsusaka T. Fujikawa K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7365-7374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The deletion analysis of the IL-6 promoter shows that such factors have indeed a co-activating and integrating function for full stimulation of the IL-6 promoter. However, using “loss-of-function” mutants of the IL-6 promoter, the crucial role of NF-κB is obvious, without the primary need for other associating DNA-bound factors. Using the “gain-of-function” approach by inserting multiple κB sites in front of an unresponsive promoter, the TNF response could be restored. Activation of NF-κB and its binding to DNA is, however, not sufficient for IL-6 gene activation by TNF; the requirement of additional activating mechanisms has already been described previously (4Haegeman G. Fiers W. Packer L. Wirtz K. Signalling Mechanisms: From Transcription Factors to Oxidative Stress. Springer Verlag, Berlin1995: 375-382Google Scholar, 9Patestos N.P. Haegeman G. Vandevoorde V. Fiers W. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). More particularly, recently, we have established the importance of the p38 MAPK pathway as a necessary mechanism for transcriptional activity of the IL-6 promoter (12Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Our present data with the nuclear fusion protein Gal4-p65 show that the basal constitutive transcriptional activity of NF-κB p65, but not that of another acidic transactivator like VP16, could be specifically enhanced by TNF, independently of effects involving the cytoplasmic activation of NF-κB. This increased transcriptional activity is the result of the activation of MAPK pathways by TNF. The p38 as well as the ERK MAPK pathway contribute to the specific up-regulation by TNF without affecting the basal TNF-independent activity. This suggests a signalization system of at least two steps from the TNF receptor to the gene, in which, first, NF-κB becomes activated in the cytoplasm by a IκBα-specific kinase, as recently reported (37Régnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar), and second, the “nuclear” transactivation potential of the DNA-bound complex is modulated by (an) additional phosphorylation event(s) via different TNF-activated MAPKs. Such a multilevel regulation allows fine tuning and/or gene specific modulation of the transcriptional activity. Whether MAPKs act directly on the p65 transcription activation complex, or via intermediate kinases, remains an open question. Nevertheless, byin vitro kinase assays it was shown that neither IκBα, nor the NF-κB DNA-binding subunits p50, nor the transactivating C-terminal half of p65 became phosphorylated by p38. However, it is still conceivable that, in vivo, a kinase downstream in the p38 and ERK pathways phosphorylates NF-κB subunits (38Wesselborg S. Bauer M.K.A. Vogt M. Schmitz M.L. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12422-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Furthermore, whether MAPK-dependent phosphorylation effectively takes place on the p65 subunit itself is also not proven. Evidence for phosphorylation-dependent regulation of NF-κB has already been reported by Naumann and Scheidereit (39Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), who found increased binding of NF-κB upon phosphorylation of the p65 subunit. Recently, Zhong and co-workers (40Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) showed a strongly increased transcriptional activity after phosphorylation of p65 on a consensus cAMP-dependent protein kinase site, which is located in the p65 Rel homology domain. However, since this site is clearly different and distinct from the p65 transactivation domains TA1 and TA2, our data point to another phosphorylation system. Schmitzet al. (21Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) also observed increased transcriptional activity upon treatment of HeLa cells with phorbol ester and suggested a possible phosphorylation in the p65 TA2 domain by a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism. It cannot, however, be excluded that different signals and/or stimuli converge into the same activation region of the p65 subunit. Recent data connect transcriptional activity of the κB p65 subunit with the versatile coactivator/cointegrator proteins p300 and CBP (41Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y.

Science. 1997; 275: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Extensive protein-protein interactions have been mapped between the N- and C-terminal regions of CBP/p300, and the C terminus of p65, containing both transactivation domains. Interestingly, since our results with the Gal4-p65 fusion proteins demonstrate a crucial role of these domains of p65 for TNF inducibility, the possible phosphorylation status of these domains in p65-CBP interaction may be of particular interest. Furthermore, the coactivator proteins CBP/p300 are subject themselves to phosphorylation control and were described as a nuclear target for S6 kinase pp90rsk and for cyclin-dependent kinases (43Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Other targets for MAPK phosphorylation are part of the RNA polymerase complex (28Bellier S. Dubois M.-F. Nishida E. Almouzni G. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell.

We utilized an in vitro model of microvascular endothelial cell angiogenesis, cells cultured within a collagen matrix, to investigate the MMP profile of endothelial cells undergoing angiogenesis. We demonstrated by gelatin zymography that monolayer cultures (two-dimensional) of endothelial cells constitutively expressed low levels of latent MMP-2, but that culture in a three-dimensional collagen matrix increased the total amount of MMP-2 mRNA and protein. Furthermore, 51% of total MMP-2 protein was activated in the three-dimensional culture lysates, compared with 3.5% in two-dimensional culture. The mRNA and protein of MT1-MMP, the putative activator of MMP-2, were up-regulated in endothelial cells cultured in three-dimensional as compared with two-dimensional culture. Treatment of cultures with MMP inhibitors blocked activation of MMP-2 and inhibited formation of endothelial cell networks within the collagen gel. Induction of MT1-MMP and MMP-2 appeared to be specific to collagen, inasmuch as culture of the endothelial cells on top of, or within, a Matrigel® matrix neither increased total MMP-2 nor increased activation of MMP-2. These results suggest that MT1-MMP activation of MMP-2 occurs in endothelial cells undergoing angiogenesis, that this activation has a functional role in endothelial cell organization, and that specific matrix interactions may be critical for the increased expression of MT1-MMP and MMP-2.

Angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels from those pre-existing, occurs during development, wound healing, and tumor growth, and in response to stimuli such as exercise and hypoxia (1Madri J.A. Sankar S. Romanic A.M. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair. Plenum Press, New York1996: 355-371Google Scholar, 2Pepper M.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 605-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 3Folkman J. EXS. 1997; 79: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). This process involves complex signaling events that cause the endothelial cells comprising capillaries to initiate proliferative and migratory phenotypes. The sprouting endothelial cells must break through their existing basement membrane and form contacts with and migrate along different extracellular matrix components, finally establishing a new, patent capillary (1Madri J.A. Sankar S. Romanic A.M. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair. Plenum Press, New York1996: 355-371Google Scholar, 2Pepper M.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 605-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In an effort to define the molecular mechanisms underlying these events, a number of in vitro cell systems have been established. These include growth of endothelial cells or blood vessel fragments in fibrin clots, on amnionic membranes, in collagen matrices, and on Matrigel® matrices (4Kubota Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Lawley T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar, 5Madri J.A. Pratt B.M. J. Histochem.

These models are characterized by re-organization that requires significant endothelial cell migration and/or invasion, and remodeling of the surrounding matrix molecules. It has been shown that microvascular endothelial cells undergo morphological changes that can include organization into tubelike structures when grown within a type I collagen matrix (7Montesano R. Orci L. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 8Madri J.A. Pratt B.M. Tucker A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 106: 1375-1384Crossref Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The morphological changes are accompanied by changes in growth factor receptor profiles and extracellular matrix protein production (9Sankar S. Mahooti-Brooks N. Bensen L. McCarthy T.L. Centrella M.

It was first recognized that matrix metalloproteinases play a role in angiogenesis, based on the observation that inhibition of MMP activity by endogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases or synthetic compounds could inhibitin vitro tube formation (13Montesano R. Orci L. Cell. 1985; 42: 469-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 14Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 117-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that the gelatinases, MMP-2 and MMP-9, are involved in vascular cell migration and invasion assays (15Schnaper H.W. Grant D.S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Fridman R.

However, the regulation of MMP expression and activation during angiogenic events is not well understood. The recent cloning of several membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs) (17Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y.

Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the controlled activation of metalloproteinases would be necessary for the in vitro remodeling of endothelial cells cultured in a collagen matrix, and that this activation would require the transcriptional up-regulation of specific MMPs, including MT-MMPs. Utilizing primary cultures of rat microvascular endothelial cells, we demonstrated a coordinate increase in expression of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP (MMP-14) following culture within a type I collagen matrix, and that activation of MMP-2 correlated temporally with MT1-MMP induction. MMP inhibitors blocked the activation of MMP-2, and prevented the establishment of multicell networks in both primary cell cultures and in microvessel explant cultures. Furthermore, the three-dimensional type I collagen matrix provided unique signals that could not be duplicated by culturing cells either within a Matrigel matrix, or on top of thin coatings of type I collagen, suggesting that a malleable type I collagen matrix is important in signal transduction of these events. Rat capillary endothelial cells were harvested from the epididymal fat pads of Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured as described by Madri and Williams (25Madri J.M. Williams S.K. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Twelve rats were used per preparation, and experiments were performed on two separate isolations of cells. Briefly, cells were grown on gelatin-coated tissue culture plates (1.5% gelatin in phosphate-buffered saline) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 25% sterile-filtered conditioned bovine aortic endothelial cell medium and 10% fetal bovine serum. For all experiments, cells were cultured in a monolayer on type I collagen-coated plates (12 μg/ml) or in three-dimensional type I collagen gels (2.5 mg/ml acid-soluble type I collagen, buffered with Earle's salt and neutralized with sterile NaOH) at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/ml collagen as described previously (8Madri J.A. Pratt B.M. Tucker A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 106: 1375-1384Crossref Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the cells in collagen suspension were placed in bacteriological Petri dishes and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, allowing gel polymerization prior to addition of medium. Gels remained attached to the plastic dish for the duration of the experiment. In variant experiments, cells were plated on top of or within a Matrigel matrix per manufacturer's specifications (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Inc.), or on top of a thin layer of polymerized collagen type I gel. In all experiments, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% sera previously passed over a gelatin-Sepharose column, in the absence of conditioned medium, to minimize contamination with MMP-2 or MMP-9. Drug treatments included the addition of transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) at a final concentration of 0.5 ng/ml, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (10 nm) immediately after plating, and again on the third day of culture. The MMP inhibitors marimastat and batimastat (BB-2516 and BB-94; a generous gift from British Biotech, Inc.) were prepared as 6 mmstock solutions in Me2SO, and used at a final concentration of 0.6 μm. Microvessel fragments were isolated from rat epididymal fat pads (20 rats/isolate) as described for endothelial cell culture (25Madri J.M. Williams S.K. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). These fragments included small arterioles, capillaries, and venules. At the final stage of isolation, fragments were resuspended in type I collagen gel and cultured in the same conditions as the endothelial cell three-dimensional cultures, using triplicate dishes per culture condition. Medium was replaced daily. Some cultures were treated daily with marimastat (0.6 μm). After 3 days or 5 days of culture, media were collected and utilized for zymography analysis and the cultures were processed for histological examination. Collagen gels were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and processed using routine paraffin-embedding procedures. Sections (6 or 20 μm thickness) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin prior to microscopic examination. Cells were lysed in 120 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.7), 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% sodium azide, and 5% glycerol. Collagen gels were homogenized in this buffer. Lysates were pelleted to remove cellular and collagen debris, and protein in the supernatant was quantitated using a bicinchonic acid assay (BCA; Pierce). Media from the cultures were collected for analysis on occasions that cultures were used for histological analysis. 10 μg of protein, or 2 μl of unconcentrated culture media, per sample were prepared in non-denaturing loading buffer and size fractionated in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel impregnated with 0.02% gelatin. The gels were then washed in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h to remove SDS, washed two times with water, then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing either 5 mm calcium chloride or 10 mm EDTA (negative control for MMP activity). Gels were subsequently fixed with 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid containing 0.25% Coomassie Blue R250. Gelatinase activity appeared as clear bands within the stained gel. Gels were dried and then scanned (300 d.p.i.) using an Arcus II scanner, and band intensities were calculated with Biomax image analysis software using a Power Macintosh 7100/80 computer. Cells were lysed in a radioimmune precipitation buffer (0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline) containing protease inhibitors (“Complete” buffer; Boehringer Mannheim). Lysates were pelleted to remove cellular debris and collagen, and then protein in the supernatant was quantitated using BCA. 10 or 20 μg of protein/sample were prepared in denaturing conditions and size fractionated in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes using semidry blotting conditions. Membranes were blocked for 1 h (25 °C) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 5% milk. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubations were done overnight (4 °C). Affinity-purified polyclonal anti-MMP-2 (used 1:2000) and anti-TIMP-2 (1:1000) were purchased from Chemicon, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Two affinity-purified polyclonal anti-MT-MMP antibodies were used at 1:1000 (gifts from Immunex, Inc. (Seattle, WA) and S. Weiss (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI)). An affinity-purified polyclonal anti-vimentin antibody (prepared by J. Madri) was used to verify equal protein loading per lane, as we had previously assessed vimentin levels to remain constant between monolayer and three-dimensional conditions. 2T. L. Haas, S. J. Davis, and J. A. Madri, unpublished observations. Secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit, horseradish preoxidase-conjugated; Amersham Corp.) was used at 1:5000. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection (Amersham Corp.) was performed per manufacturer's instructions. Total cellular RNA was extracted from endothelial cells in monolayer or three-dimensional culture after solubilizing the cells or collagen gels in Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration was determined by spectrophotometer. 5 or 10 μg of total RNA was denatured in sample buffer (20 mm MOPS, 6% formaldehyde, 50% formamide), electrophoresed through a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, and then transferred to a GeneScreen Plus membrane (NEN Life Science Products) by capillary transfer using 10 × SSC. Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out according to manufacturer's directions. 32P-Labeled cDNA probes encoding mouse MMP-2 and human MT1-MMP (cDNA were kind gifts of K. Tryggvason (University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland) and M. Seiki (Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan), respectively) were prepared by random primer labeling (Stratagene, Inc.), separated from unincorporated nucleotides using NucTrap columns (Stratagene, Inc.) and added to fresh hybridization buffer. Blots were washed using two washes of 2 × SSC (25 °C), two washes of 2 × SSC, 2% SDS (65 °C), and two washes of 0.1 × SSC (25 °C), then exposed to HyperFilm (Amersham Corp.) for several hours or overnight. Blots were stripped and reprobed with a 28 S ribosomal probe (Ambion, Inc.) to normalize for RNA loading. Films were scanned (300 d.p.i.) using an Arcus II scanner, and band intensities were calculated using Biomax image analysis software. Intensities of experimental bands were normalized based on load, according to the measured 28 S densities. Statistical analyses were performed on the normalized values, using a Student's t test, with significance established asp < 0.05. To define MMP activities of endothelial cells grown as a monolayer on type I collagen (two-dimensional), or grown within a gel composed type 1 collagen (three-dimensional), we compared proteolytic activity between the two conditions using gelatin zymography. Gelatin zymography is a sensitive technique for the direct detection of any MMPs that can proteolyze gelatin (collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, and matrilysin). Lysates from monolayer cultures and three-dimensional cultures both contained gelatinase activity (Fig. 1 A). MMP-2 (72-kDa gelatinase) was seen almost entirely in the latent form in endothelial cell monolayers, with only 3.5 ± 1.9% (n = 8) in the active form (62 kDa). In contrast, 51 ± 4.5% of MMP-2 in the three-dimensional cultures was in the activated form, with the total amount of MMP-2 (latent + active) approximately 300 ± 75% that of two-dimensional cultures (n = 8). MMP-1 (interstitial collagenase; 52 kDa, latent size) was not evident in either culture condition, based on the complete absence of bands smaller than 62 kDa by gelatin zymography. Latent MMP-9 was not observed in monolayer cultures and was infrequently detected in three-dimensional cultures. Active MMP-9 was never detected. Interestingly, the gelatinase profile was not altered by treatment of cell cultures with angiogenic factors TGFβ1 or the phorbol ester PMA. Initially, we utilized lysates rather than collected media to ensure that all cell-associated MMP activity would be detected. Media collected from these cultures and assessed by zymography showed the same pattern of MMP-2 induction and activation with the exception that, after 1 day in culture, less MMP-2 protein (both latent and active) was detectable in the media than in the cell lysates; after 3 days of culture, levels of protein appeared similar in media and in lysates (data not shown). Northern (Fig. 1 B) and Western (Fig. 1 C) blotting were performed to confirm the low level, constitutive expression of MMP-2 in endothelial cell monolayer culture and the increase of both MMP-2 mRNA (Table I) and protein in three-dimensional culture. mRNA and protein levels were elevated after 1 day of three-dimensional culture, remained elevated after 3 days of three-dimensional culture, and were not affected by TGFβ1 or PMA treatment, consistent with zymography results.Table IComparison of changes in mRNA levels of MMP-2, MT1-MMP, and TIMP-2 in two- and three-dimensional cultureTwo-dimensionalThree-dimensionalUntreatedPMAUntreatedPMAMMP-211.1 ± 0.045.0 ± 1.81-aSignificantly different from the untreated samples (P < 0.05).6.6 ± 0.91-aSignificantly different from the untreated samples (P < 0.05).,1-bNo significant difference from the three-dimensional untreated samples (P > 0.05).MT1-MMP11.1 ± 0.013.2 ± 1.11-aSignificantly different from the untreated samples (P < 0.05).1.8 ± 0.41-aSignificantly different from the untreated samples (P < 0.05).,1-bNo significant difference from the three-dimensional untreated samples (P > 0.05).TIMP-2 4.0 kb10.86 ± 0.21.2 ± 0.62.1 ± 0.3 1.2 kb10.86 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.21.2 ± 0.21-a Significantly different from the untreated samples (P < 0.05).1-b No significant difference from the three-dimensional untreated samples (P > 0.05).

Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Although several MT-MMP genes have been cloned, MT1-MMP (or MMP-14) is the most thoroughly documented in its ability to activate MMP-2. Thus, we assessed the amount of MT1-MMP present in monolayer and three-dimensional cultures. Very little MT1-MMP mRNA or protein were detectable in monolayer cultures, but both mRNA and protein were induced in three-dimensional cultures (Table I; Fig. 2 A). By Western blotting, MT1-MMP was detected as a single band of approximately 63 kDa; smaller (processed) forms of the protein were not detectable. The time course of MT1-MMP induction (detectable within 1 day of three-dimensional culture) correlated with the detection of activated MMP-2 by zymography (see Fig. 1 A). MT1-MMP mRNA levels were insensitive to either TGFβ1 or PMA treatment. Tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) is postulated, at low concentrations, to be a necessary component for the activation of MMP-2 (23Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), and has been shown to function as a competitive inhibitor of MMPs at higher concentrations. Based on the large fraction of activated MMP-2 seen by gelatin zymography of three-dimensional cultures, we hypothesized that TIMP-2 levels were sufficient to allow activation of MMP-2, but low enough so as not to inhibit MT1-MMP or MMP-2 function, thus conferring an overall proteolytic phenotype to the culture. Northern and Western blotting established that TIMP-2 mRNA and protein levels in fact did not change in three-dimensional culture (Table I; Fig. 2 B). An increase in the amount of activated MMP-2 and no change in the level of TIMP-2 protein implied a shift to increased proteolytic activity of MMP-2. Again, TIMP-2 mRNA transcripts were not sensitive to PMA or TGFβ1 treatment. Coordinated expression of MT1-MMP with MMP-2 appeared consistent with MT1-MMP acting as the activator of pro-MMP-2. To strengthen this argument, we utilized the nonselective MMP inhibitors marimastat or batimastat (high affinity for multiple matrix metalloproteinases) (26Wojtowicz-Praga S.M. Dickson R.B. Hawkins M.J. Invest. New Drugs. 1997; 15: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), hypothesizing that if pro-MMP-2 were activated through an MMP-dependent pathway (i.e. MT1-MMP), then MMP inhibitors would block cleavage and activation of pro-MMP-2. One day treatment of three-dimensional cultures with marimastat (0.6 μm) blocked the cleavage of MMP-2 to the active 62-kDa form (Fig. 3). Inhibition of MMP-2 activation was also seen at 3 days after marimastat treatment. The total amount of MMP-2 protein in three-dimensional culture was not affected by marimastat treatment, as assessed by densitometry of zymography bands. Microvascular endothelial cells underwent morphological changes when cultured within a three-dimensional type I collagen matrix, as has been described previously (27Merwin J.R. Anderson J.M. Kocher O. Itallie C.M.V. Madri J.A. J. Cell Physiol. 1990; 142: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Within a day of culturing, the cells took on an elongated shape, often with multiple extended processes. Continuing the culture, multicell interactions resembling tube structures were formed (Fig. 4 A). Treatment with TGFβ1 augmented this phenomenon, with observable formation of multicellular structures exhibiting lumen structures (Fig. 4 C). PMA has been used to induce the in vitroformation of tubes by human endothelial cells (13Montesano R. Orci L. Cell. 1985; 42: 469-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar); however, the rat microvascular endothelial cells did not increase tube formation in response to PMA (data not shown). Treatment of the endothelial cell three-dimensional cultures with the MMP inhibitor marimastat, either in the presence or absence of TGFβ1, resulted in cells that appeared either rounded or stellate, as if unable to progress beyond the initial stages of cell attachment and spreading. In these cultures, there was a marked failure of cells to elongate and to establish tubelike structures (Fig. 4, B and D). In the presence of TGFβ1, marimastat treatment appeared to inhibit the organization of cell aggregates into structures containing lumina. Treatment of endothelial cell monolayer cultures with the MMP inhibitor had no noticeable effects on cell morphology or behavior (data not shown). The effects of MMP inhibitor treatment on three-dimensional cultures supported the involvement of MMPs in establishing lumina-containing, multicell networks. Cells in monolayer culture conditions never formed networks or tubelike structures. Explant cultures were used to further define the roles of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP in a more complex in vitro system. Thus, we assessed the zymographic profile and the morphology of microvessel fragments cultured within a type I collagen matrix. The microvessel fragments contained a mixed population of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and pericytes. Despite this mixed population of cells, we hypothesized that the MMP-2 induction and activation would occur in like manner to the endothelial cell cultures. Gelatin zymography was performed on lysates of freshly isolated fragments, and on media collected from 3-day explant cultures (Fig. 5). Lysates from freshly isolated blood vessel fragments contained multiple matrix metalloproteinases, including latent MMP-2, and several non-MMP gelatinases (as evidenced by bands appearing in the EDTA control gel). Gelatinolytic proteins other than MMP-2 detected in the explant lysates but not in the cultured endothelial cell lysates are most likely derived from one or several of the multiple non-endothelial cell types present within the explant cultures. Media collected after 3 days of culture in type I collagen showed a significant increase in the total amount of MMP-2 and in the fraction of active MMP-2. At this time point, multiple endothelial cell sprouts from the pre-existing vessel fragments were observable (Fig. 6 A). Notably, marimastat treatment of these cultures greatly reduced the amount of active MMP-2 (Fig. 5), as well as the extent of endothelial cell sprouting (Fig. 6 B). These findings are consistent with results using the endothelial cell cultures (see Fig. 3), thus strengthening the hypothesis that MMP-2 and MT1-MMP play specific roles in angiogenesis.Figure 6MMP inhibitors block angiogenic sprouting of microvessels in explant cultures. After 3 days of culture, many microvessel fragments formed multiple endothelial cell sprouts that migrated into the collagen matrix (A). However, marimastat treatment (0.6 μm) greatly reduced the number and length of the endothelial sprouts (B). In both panels, original microvessel fragments (denoted by black dots), had a rough surface appearance, and individual cells are not detectable. On the other hand, the endothelial sprouts (denoted by arrows) were thin and had a smooth surface, and endothelial cells comprising the sprouts were oriented parallel to the long axis of the sprout. Scale bar represents 100 μm. These images are representative fields of view from triplicate cultures of one isolate of rat microvessels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Finally, we considered whether the induction of MMP-2 protein and its activation were responses general to other types extracellular matrices or whether these responses were specific to the type I collagen matrix. Neither the induction of MMP-2 protein nor the activation of pro-MMP-2 occurred when endothelial cells were cultured either on, or within, a Matrigel matrix (Fig. 7 A), suggesti"

The ubiquitinated IκBα conjugates readily associate with VCP both in vivo and in vitro, and this complex appears dissociated from NF-κB. In ultracentrifugation analysis, physically associated VCP and ubiquitinated IκBα complexes sediment in the 19 S fractions, while the unmodified IκBα sediments in the 4.5 S fractions deficient in VCP. Phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IκBα are critical for VCP binding, which in turn is necessary but not sufficient for IκBα degradation; while the N-terminal domain of IκBα is required in all three reactions, both N- and C-terminal domains are required in degradation. Further, VCP co-purifies with the 26 S proteasome on two-dimensional gels and co-immunoprecipitates with subunits of the 26 S proteasome.

Transcription factor NF-κB is involved in a large variety of processes, such as cell growth, transcriptional regulation, immune, inflammatory, and stress responses (reviewed in Refs. 1Thanos D.

NF-κB is a homo- or heterodimer consisting of various combinations of the family members, including NFκB1 (p50 and precursor p105), c-Rel, RelA, NFκB2 (p52 and precursor p100), RelB, and Drosophilaproteins Dorsal and Dif. Unlike many other transcription factors that are localized in the nucleus, the NF-κB dimeric factor is sequestered in the cytoplasm of most cells through binding to a family of inhibitor proteins, IκB. In response to extracellular stimuli, the inhibitors are partially or entirely degraded, thus liberating the DNA-binding dimer for translocation to the nucleus. The I6B family contains IκBα, IκBβ, IκBγ, Bcl-3, the precursor proteins p105 and p100, and the Drosophila protein Cactus. All members of the IκB family contain 5–8 ankyrin motifs, thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions. It has been shown that when the precursor protein p105 is involved as the inhibitor, the processing from p105 to the active p50 occurs through the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome (Ub-Pr) 1The abbreviations used are: Ub-Pr, ubiquitin-dependent proteasome; Ub, ubiquitin; Ub-Iκβα, ubiquitinated IκBα; IP, immunoprecipitation; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); VCP, valosin-containing protein. pathway, which degrades the C-terminal ankyrin-containing domain of p105 (5Palombella V.J.

For the prototype complex that contains p50, p65, and IκBα, upon stimulation the entire NF-κB complex becomes hyperphosphorylated.

It was proposed that the inactivation of IκBα occurs through a series of ordered processes including phosphorylation, ATP-dependent multiple ubiquitin conjugation, and proteasome-mediated proteolysis. However, the link between ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation remains unclear. The extralysosomal, energy-dependent Ub-Pr pathway is a major mechanism used to regulate many critical cellular proteins that must be rapidly destroyed for normal growth and metabolism (reviewed in Refs. 16Goldberg A.L. Science. 1995; 268: 522-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 17Jentsch S. Schlenker S. Cell. 1995; 82: 881-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 18Hochstrasser M.

The rapidly growing list of the substrates for the Ub-Pr pathway includes mitotic cyclins, G1 cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27, Sic1 protein, proto-oncogene products p53, c-Myc, c-Jun, and c-Mos, NF-κB inhibitors, yeast MATα2 transcription factor, major histocompatibility complex molecules, and others. The Ub-Pr proteolytic pathway is ATP-dependent and present in both cytoplasm and nucleus. The pathway consists of two distinct, sequential steps. The target protein is first conjugated with multiple ubiquitin (Ub) molecules that mark the substrate for destruction. The Ub-tagged target is then translocated to (probably with the help of molecular chaperones) and degraded by a large protease complex with an apparent sedimentation coefficient of 26 S. The 26 S proteasome is a multisubunit complex, consisting of a central cylinder-shaped 20 S multicatalytic proteinase core and a 19 S cap-like regulatory complex attached to each end of the cylinder. The terminal cap structure consists of at least 18 distinct subunits with molecular masses of 35–110 kDa and has ATPase and ubiquitin conjugate binding activities. It is presumed that ATP hydrolysis by the 19 S complex provides the energy needed for the chaperoning and unfolding of substrates degraded within the proteasome cylinder. VCP (22Koller K.J.

The apparent paradox between the striking sequence homology and the large diversity of functions in this family suggests that these proteins have a basic and critical role in cellular function, and the involvement in many other functions may be indirect. During the course of studying the molecular mechanisms involved in IκBα degradation, we detected VCP physically associated with IκBα complexes both in vivo and in vitro. In this report, we demonstrate that VCP is involved in the proteasome-mediated degradation of IκBα, and VCP is co-purified with the 26 S proteasome. Consistent with this hypothesis, VCP indeed has in vitro ATPase activity and an apparent sedimentation coefficient of 19 S (Ref. 24Egerton M. Samelson L.E. J. Biol.

Cells were labeled with 0.1 mCi/ml (1000 Ci/mmol) [35S]methionine/cysteine (ICN) at a density of 5 × 106/ml for approximately 16 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (1% aprotinin, 70 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 40 μg/ml Tos-Phe-CH2Cl, 5 μg/ml Tos-Lys-CH2Cl, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min and incubated with antisera. The immune complexes were collected with Protein A-Sepharose beads, washed with RIPA buffer, boiled, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylpyrrolidone membranes, and analyzed by autoradiography. IPs shown in Figs. 1 A and 2 Bwere conducted in Buffer I (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) containing protease inhibitors, 100 μm calpain inhibitor I, and 10 mmiodoacetamide, and the precipitates were washed with Buffer I without bovine serum albumin. For reimmunoprecipitation experiments, the immune complexes isolated from the first IP were boiled in RIPA containing 1% SDS, diluted, and subjected to the second IP. For immunoblot analysis, equal amounts of protein or immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto membranes. The membrane was blocked, washed, and incubated with antiserum (typically at 1:3,000), followed by reaction with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin serum (Boehringer Mannheim), and developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL) (Amersham Corp.). When serial blotting analyses were performed, previous reactivity was stripped off from the membrane.Figure 2Generation of VCP antisera and co-immunoprecipitation of high M r Ub-IκBα in VCP immune complexes. A, DB cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and lysed in RIPA buffer containing 0.1% SDS. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated in the same buffer with the specified preimmune sera (P) or the corresponding anti-VCP immune sera (I). Immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membrane, and visualized by autoradiography.

Glutathione-Sepharose beads containing GST or GST fusion proteins were mixed with 35S-labeledin vitro translated proteins or unlabeled B cell lysates in a total volume of 225 μl of binding buffer (35 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol including protease inhibitors). After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C and three washes with binding buffer, the bound products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western transfer, autoradiography, and immunoblotting. Velocity sedimentation centrifugation was carried out in 10–40% glycerol gradients in a total volume of 13 ml of 12 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2. Freshly prepared CA46 cell lysate in a volume of 200 μl was loaded onto the gradient and centrifuged at 4 °C, in an SW41 rotor at 36,000 rpm for 16 h. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting or IP. Protein markers were centrifuged in separate tubes and included thyroglobulin (19 S), immunoglobulin G (7 S), and bovine serum globulin (4.5 S). Cytosolic fractions were prepared by lysing cells in a hypotonic buffer (5 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) on ice for 10 min. The lysates were clarified by low speed centrifugation for 10 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1–2 h, and the supernatant, S100, was stored in aliquots at −70 °C. Proteasome-enriched (Pr+), and proteasome-depleted (Pr−) fractions were extracted from CA46 cells as described by Palombella et al. (5Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T.

At various time points, 50 μg of S100 was added to individual tubes to start the reaction at 37 °C. The final volume in each reaction was adjusted to 50 μl. All of the reactions were simultaneously terminated by boiling and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western transfer and autoradiography. The ubiquitinated IκBα (Ub-IκBα) conjugates were generated by slightly modified Ub-conjugation assays (6Orian A. Whiteside S. Israel A. Stancovski I. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23726-23729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The highly purified 26 S proteasome isolated from human red blood cells was resolved by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing followed by SDS-gel electrophoresis. IP performed on cell lysates containing active NF-κB detected IκBα, p50, p65, and an unidentified 90-kDa cellular protein (p90) (Refs. 9Li C.-C.H. Dai R.-M. Longo D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Ferris D.K. Chen E. Dai R.-M. Longo D.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When the p90-containing IκBα complex was subjected to the in vitro Ub-Pr degradation assay, unlike IκBα molecules, p90 was resistant to degradation (9Li C.-C.H. Dai R.-M. Longo D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To identify p90, IκBα immune complexes were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the p90 band was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, excised, and subjected to N-terminal peptide sequencing. Although the N terminus of p90 was blocked, peptide sequencing of two of the V8 proteolytic fragments of p90 revealed a total of 20 residues identical to those of the murine valosin-containing protein, VCP (23Egerton M. Ashe O.R. Chen D. Druker B.J. Burgess W.H. Samelson L.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3533-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). IP followed by immunoblotting with either C terminus-specific anti-VCP-1 or N terminus-specific anti-VCP-2, kindly provided by L. Samelson (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), confirmed that the p90 was VCP (Fig. 1 A, bottom).

To test the “lipotoxicity hypothesis,” which attributes the beta cell dysfunction of adipogenic NIDDM to an excessive accumulation of fat in the pancreatic islets, we sought to determine if troglitazone-mediated amelioration of beta cell function in islets of ZDF rats might be associated with a reduction in their elevated triglyceride (TG) content. Troglitazone (10 μm) in the culture medium reduced the TG content of ZDF rats by 52%; this was reflected by decreased esterification and increased oxidation of [3H]palmitate. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase mRNA fell by 57% and acyl-CoA synthetase mRNA by 67% (brain isoform) and 38% (liver isoform), all consistent with the effects of troglitazone on TG metabolism. The 52% decrease in islet TG was accompanied by >30- and 2-fold improvements in glucose- and arginine-stimulated insulin secretion, respectively. We conclude that troglitazone exerts direct lipopenic activity in normal islets and in islets of obese prediabetic ZDF rats; in the latter, this correlated with improvement in beta cell function.

We have proposed that the overaccumulation of fat is the result of the mutation in the leptin receptor (OB-R) (4Phillips M.S. Liu Q. Hammond H.A. Dugan V. Valarie D. Hey P.J. Caskey C.J. Hess J.F.

Invest. 1997; 100: 290-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Indeed, overexpression of a normal leptin receptor in such islets lowers islet fat to normal levels in response to leptin and reduces nitric oxide production 2Wang, M.-Y., Koyama, H., Shimabukuro, M., Newgard, C. B., and Unger, R. H. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, in press. ; it therefore appears that the OB-R mutation is the proximal cause of the fat overload and the resulting β-cytotoxicity. If this is correct, any agent that lowers islet TG should improve beta cell function in islets of ZDF rats. The leptin resistance of ZDF rat islets is so severe that even the induction of marked hyperleptinemia by adenovirus-leptin gene transfer fails to lower their islet TG content (6Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M.-Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). However, troglitazone, a member of the thiazolidinedione family of drugs, has a leptin-like TG-lowering effect on the fat-laden islets of ZDF rats as well as on normal islets (9Shimabukuro M.

Total RNA was extracted by the TRIzol isolation method (Life Technologies, Inc.) from ∼100 islets following 48 h in culture. RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI), and first strand cDNA was generated from 2 μg of RNA in a 20-μl volume using the oligo(dT) primer first strand cDNA synthesis kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA).

Linearity of the PCR was tested by amplification of 200 ng of total RNA/reaction from 15 to 50 cycles. The linear range extended from 15 to 40 cycles. The samples were amplified for 30 cycles, each using the following parameters: 92 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. β-Actin primers were used as a control.

The total palmitate concentration was 1 mmol/liter. Excess [3H]palmitate was removed by precipitating twice with an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid with 2% bovine serum albumin. The supernatants in a microcentrifuge tube were placed in a scintillation vial containing unlabeled water and incubated at 50 °C for 18 h. Palmitate oxidation was assessed by measuring the tritiated water in the medium as described for usage of [3H]glucose (17Milburn Jr., J.L. Hirose H. Lee Y. Nagasawa Y. Ogawa A. Ohneda M.

Diabetes. 1997; 46: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Groups of 50–100 islets were collected under a stereoscopic microscope, washed twice with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate/Hepes buffer (pH 7.4, 3 mmglucose), and loaded into a 13-mm chamber containing an 8-mm nylon membrane filter (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Islets were perifused with buffer containing 3 or 23 mm glucose or 20 mm arginine at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min for 15 min each (8Shimabukuro M. Ohneda M. Lee Y. Unger R.H. J. Clin.

Immunoreactive insulin was determined by radioimmunoassay using charcoal separation. All results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated using Student'st test or one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. To establish the leptin-like TG-lowering action of troglitazone, we cultured normal islets from wild-type lean (+/+) ZDF rats and fat-laden islets from obese prediabetic (fa/fa) ZDF rats with 10 μmtroglitazone. At the end of 48 h, we measured the islet TG content. Without treatment, the TG content of fa/fa islets was significantly above that of normal islets, even when normalized for the differences in islet size (p < 0.01) (Table II, part A). With treatment, there were 39 and 52% declines in TG content in fat-laden fa/fa islets (Table II, part A). Although the TG content of the troglitazone-treatedfa/fa islets was still almost 3 times that of untreated normal islets, when corrected for differences in islet size, there was no difference from normal islets.Table IITG content (part A) and rates of of oxidation and esterification of [3H]palmitate (part B) in islets from normal lean (+/+) and prediabetic obese (fa/fa) ZDF rats cultured with 1 mmpalmitate for 48 h with or without troglitazoneTroglitazoneChange0 μm10 μm%A.

Open table in a new tab We have previously observed that leptin induces in normal islets the expression of two critical enzymes of fatty acid oxidation, acyl-CoA oxidase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, and lowers the expression of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, an enzyme of fatty acid esterification (18Zhou Y.-T. Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Lee Y. Wang M.-Y. Trieu F. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6386-6390Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Troglitazone, by contrast, did not up-regulate either the carnitine palmitoyltransferase I or acyl-CoA oxidase/β-actin mRNA ratio in islets from lean or obese rats (Figs. 1 and2). It did, however, significantly reduce the mRNA ratios for glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase and both the brain and liver isoforms of acyl-CoA synthetase in both groups (Figs. 1 and 2). In islets from obese rats, the ratios declined by 57, 67, and 38%, respectively.Figure 2Effect of troglitazone on mRNA expression of acyl-CoA oxidase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, and brain- and liver-type acyl-CoA synthetases in islets isolated from lean (+/+) and obese (fa/fa) ZDF rats and treated for 48 h with or without troglitazone.

Esterification of [3H]palmitate was decreased by 13% (Table II, part B). If the impaired beta cell function of the obese fa/fa rats were secondary to the high TG content, the 52% troglitazone-mediated reduction in fat content per islet from ∼6 times normal to 2.7 times normal (Table II, part A) should be associated with at least some functional improvement. Fig. 3 indicates the effect of troglitazone on basal, glucose-stimulated, and arginine-stimulated insulin secretion by the islets of obese ZDF rats perifused at the end of the culture period. Basal insulin secretion was reduced by 25% in the islets of obese prediabetic ZDF rats after 48 h of culture with troglitazone, whereas the increments in glucose- and arginine-stimulated insulin secretion were increased >30- and ∼2-fold, respectively, above control values (p < 0.01). These troglitazone-induced changes in insulin secretion resemble the hyperinsulinemic patterns of compensated islets of obese rats reported previously (19Hirose H. Lee Y.H. Inman L.R. Nagasawa Y.

Earlier studies have demonstrated that acute and subacute exposure of islets to exogenously produced elevations of free fatty acid may alter beta cell function (1Lee Y. Hirose H. Ohneda M.

In this report, we have examined the effects of troglitazone on beta cell function, islet fat content, and metabolism of islets chronically exposed in vivo to the endogenously elevated free fatty acid levels of obesity (1Lee Y.

Previously, we reported a close relationship between the accumulation of islet fat and the appearance of the beta cell abnormalities and hyperglycemia (1Lee Y. Hirose H. Ohneda M. Johnson J.H.

Inman L. Unger R.H. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Here we have studied thein vitro effects of troglitazone, a drug shown to be effective in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in humans (13Nolan J.J. Ludvik B. Beerdsen P.

Physiol. 1996; 271: E742-E747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to determine if its effectiveness, like that of caloric restriction, might be associated with a reduction in islet TG content. We have found that troglitazone has a potent lipopenic effect on both the normal islets and fat-laden islets of obese ZDF rats with the OB-R mutation. In addition to bypassing the leptin receptor, the mechanism by which troglitazone induces lipopenia must differ somewhat from leptin-induced lipopenia in normal islets (6Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M.-Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 18Zhou Y.-T. Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Lee Y.

A. 1997; 94: 6386-6390Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) since, in contrast to leptin, there was no increase in mRNA of genes encoding two enzymes of fatty acid oxidation, acyl-CoA oxidase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I. Nevertheless, oxidation of [3H]palmitate was increased by troglitazone, as it is by leptin (6Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M.-Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Expression of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, an enzyme of fatty acid esterification, which is profoundly reduced by leptin (18Zhou Y.-T. Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Lee Y. Wang M.-Y. Trieu F. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6386-6390Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), and of the brain and liver acyl-CoA synthetase isoforms was significantly decreased by troglitazone, as it is by leptin (6Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M.-Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Thus, troglitazone appears to exert a direct TG-lowering effect on islet cells. The 52% reduction in TG content still left the islets of the obese rats with a fat content 2.7 times that of untreated islets of lean rats (28.4 versus 10.4 ng/islet), but normal when corrected for the difference in islet size (Table II). The beta cell response to glucose rose >30-fold (Fig. 3 B), whereas the arginine response doubled. This pattern of increased insulin secretion (Fig. 3 A) resembles that of islets from fully compensated obese prediabetic ZDF rats (17Milburn Jr., J.L. Hirose H. Lee Y. Nagasawa Y. Ogawa A. Ohneda M. BeltrandelRio H. Newgard C.B. Johnson J.H. Unger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1295-1299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 19Hirose H. Lee Y.H. Inman L.R.

Thus, troglitazone produced a pattern of insulin secretion capable of compensating for insulin resistance. TG reduction in +/+ islets with a normal TG content and normal beta cell function did not alter beta cell function (Fig. 3). While these correlative findings do not establish a cause-effect relationship between excessive islet fat content and beta cell dysfunction, they support the lipotoxicity hypothesis by providing yet another association between the two abnormalities. A possible causal link between fatty acids and β-cytotoxicity has been provided by the recent demonstration that fat-laden ZDF islets have a greatly increased nitric oxide response to long-chain free fatty acids (8Shimabukuro M. Ohneda M. Lee Y. Unger R.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 290-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 9Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Lee Y. Unger R.H. J. Clin.

The ability to manipulate pharmacologically the dynamics of intracellular lipid homeostasis in islets may herald a new strategy for designing drugs that prevent the diabetes of obesity.

Here we describe the cloning and expression of Slo3, a novel potassium channel abundantly expressed in mammalian spermatocytes. Slo3 represents a new and unique type of potassium channel regulated by both intracellular pH and membrane voltage. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Northern analysis, and in situ hybridization show that Slo3 is primarily expressed in testis in both mouse and human. Because of its sensitivity to both pH and voltage, Slo3 could be involved in sperm capacitation and/or the acrosome reaction, essential steps in fertilization where changes in both intracellular pH and membrane potential are known to occur. The protein sequence of mSlo3 (the mouse Slo3 homologue) is similar to Slo1, the large conductance, calcium- and voltage-gated potassium channel. These results suggest that Slo channels comprise a multigene family, defined by a combination of sensitivity to voltage and a variety of intracellular factors. Northern analysis from human testis indicates that a Slo3 homologue is present in humans and conserved with regard to sequence, transcript size, and tissue distribution. Because of its high testis-specific expression, pharmacological agents that target human Slo3 channels may be useful in both the study of fertilization as well as in the control or enhancement of fertility.

Many ion channels respond to membrane depolarization or intracellular ligands. In the Slo1 channel, originally cloned fromDrosophila, these features are combined in a channel that opens in response to both depolarization and intracellular calcium increases (1Atkinson N.

One proposed role of the Slo1 channel is to provide negative feedback for the entry of calcium into cells via hyperpolarization-induced closure of voltage-dependent calcium channels. Perhaps because of the versatility of this mechanism, Slo1 channels are expressed in many tissues where voltage-gated calcium channels are present, including brain, skeletal and smooth muscle, auditory hair cells, pancreas, and adrenal gland (8Marty A.

In contrast to other multigene voltage-gated K+ channel families, Slo1 has remained the sole functionally characterized representative of its family (16Wei A. Jegla T. Salkoff L. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 805-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Here we describe mSlo3, 1The abbreviations used are: mSlo3, mouse Slo3; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; TEA, tetraethylammonium; bp, base pairs(s); kb, kilobase(s). a pH- and voltage-dependent Slo family member prominently expressed in mouse spermatocytes. Despite similarity in sequence of mSlo3 to mSlo1, mSlo3 is insensitive to calcium over a wide concentration range. Thus, the unifying characteristics of the Slo gene family of channels may be a dual sensitivity to membrane voltage and a variety of intracellular factors, such as [H+] for mSlo3. The uniquely abundant expression of mSlo3 in developing spermatocytes presents further interesting questions. Spermatocytes require proteins tailored to fulfill roles unique to the process of germ cell development and fertilization. Cellular signaling in spermatic cells is tightly regulated to prevent inappropriate activation of the irreversible steps that prepare the sperm to fertilize the oocyte. Many of these steps are triggered and coordinated by changes in membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ concentration and pH. Because of the central importance of these events in development, many efforts have been made to identify the specific proteins, including ion channels, which regulate spermatic function. In particular, there have been reports of channels present in spermatocytes (19Cook S.P. Babcock D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22402-22407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chan H.C.

In addition, a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel has been directly cloned from testis (25Weyand I. Godde M. Frings S. Welner J. Muller F. Altenhofen W. Hatt H. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1994; 368: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The mSlo3 channel exhibits a unique combination of voltage dependence and sensitivity to pH that may be important for spermatic function. By tBlastn (NCBI), an EST (GenBankTMaccession number AA072586) was identified by homology to the C-terminal “tail” of mSlo1 (17Wei A. Solaro C. Lingle C. Salkoff L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 671-681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The EST originated from a mouse promyelocytic WEHI-3 cell line cDNA library. A 32P-labeled 1,254-bp PCR product generated from the EST pBluescript plasmid (Genome Systems) was employed to isolate cDNA clones from a WEHI-3 library (Stratagene) by hybridization. The oligonucleotides used to generate the probe were 5′-GTGGATGATACCGACATGCTGGAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAGACCACCTCTCTCCCGTGTCGT-3′ (antisense). mSlo3 expression in the WEHI-3 cell line is apparently anomalous; all isolated cDNAs were inappropriately spliced or truncated, and PCR analysis of the WEHI-3 cDNA bank using combinations of primers complementary to mSlo3 and vector sequence indicated that complete cDNAs were not represented. Subsequent screening of a mouse testis cDNA library (Dr. Graeme Mardon) yielded cDNAs that extended to the putative initiator methionine, as shown in Fig. 1. The reading frame was closed upstream from the initiator methionine. A full-length cDNA was constructed from two overlapping cDNAs. The presence of full-length transcripts in testis corresponding to this cDNA was verified by RT-PCR from total testis RNA. The entire cDNA was sequenced in both directions. For expression in Xenopus oocytes, a Kozak initiator sequence (26Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar) was introduced by PCR, and the entire open reading frame was subcloned into the pOocyte-Xpress vector (17Wei A. Solaro C.

Reaction products were electrophoresed on 1.5 and 3.0% agarose gels using standard Tris-borate (TBE) buffer and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. PCR primer pairs used were 1) mSlo3 (S4 to S5), 5′-CTCGAACTCCCTAAAATCTTACAGAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTCCGTTGAGCCAGGGGTCACCAGAATT-3′ (antisense) to generate a 156-bp product; 2) mSlo3 (S8 to S9), 5′-TCTGCTTTGTGAAGCTAAATCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTTCAAAGCCTCTTTAGCGGTAA-3′ (antisense) to generate a 690-bp product; 3) mSlo3 (S9 to S10), 5′-TTATGCCTGGATCTGCACTCTACATG-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATAGTTTCCGTCTACTACCGAAA-3′ (antisense) to generate a 221-bp product; 4) human β-actin, 5′-GATGATATCGCCGCGCTCGTCGTCGAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCGGTCCAGGTCTGCGTCCTACCGTAC-3′ (antisense) to generate a 535-bp product. Total RNA was isolated from freshly dissected mouse tissue using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.). 20 μg of total RNA from each tissue was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose denaturing gel using MOPS-formaldehyde buffer then transferred to nitrocellulose. The human tissue blot was obtained commercially (CLONTECH). A PCR product generated using primers 5′-CGGAAACGTCATGTACAATCGAAATCCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTCCGTTGAGCCAGGGGTCACCAGAATT-3′ (antisense) was labeled using random hexanucleotides (Boehringer Mannheim). Both human and mouse blots were hybridized and washed under standard high stringency conditions and exposed to x-ray film for 4–16 h. After hybridization with mSlo3 probes, blots were rehybridized with a human β-actin probe to verify RNA loading. Testes from white mice >30 days old were dissected, frozen, sectioned immediately with a cryostat, collected on slides, and stored at −20 °C. A partial mSlo3 cDNA (approximately 1 kb, corresponding to coding sequence for residues 170–510) was subcloned into pBluescript II KS+(Stratagene). T3 and T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene) were used to synthesize [33P]UTP-labeled antisense and sense probes, respectively, from linearized plasmid. Slides were hybridized overnight at 55 °C. After washing, slides were dipped in NTB-2 liquid emulsion (Eastman Kodak Co.), air-dried, and placed in light-protected boxes at 4 °C for 10 days. cRNA (40 nl at approximately 1 μg/μl) was injected into mature Xenopus oocytes; recordings were made 1–8 days later. For whole cell recording, medium nd96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmHEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mm DIDS (to block endogenous chloride currents) was employed as a bath solution or modified as noted in the figure legends. Patches were perfused with either zero Ca2+-EGTA solutions (160 mmpotassium gluconate, 34 mm KOH, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm EGTA) or Ca2+-containing (184 mm potassium gluconate, 10 mm KOH, 10 mm HEPES, 200 μm hemicalcium gluconate) solutions. HCl was used to adjust the pH. The pipette solution contained 0.5 mm potassium gluconate, 0.5 mmKCl, 1.1 mm KOH, 10 mm HEPES, 159 mm sodium gluconate, and 2 mM hemimagnesium gluconate, pH 7.1. Whole cell recordings were obtained using the two-electrode voltage clamp TEV-200 amplifier (Dagan). Patch currents were recorded on either an Axopatch 1B or 200A amplifier (Axon) and digitized at either 3.4, 5, or 10 kHz. Data acquisition and analysis programs were CCURRENT and CQUANT (Dr. Keith Baker) or pClamp6 (Axon). Single-channel conductance was determined from the slope of the unitary current amplitude versus voltage relation. The tail current amplitude versus voltage data (see Fig. 4) were fit with the sum of two independent Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz current equations. Each equation has the form I =PVm F 2/RT × ([S]i − [S]o × EXP(−Vm F/RT))/1 −e −VmF/RT, where S is either K+ or Na+. P, the permeability of Na+ or K+, was allowed to vary freely. [S]i and [S]o represent ion concentrations inside and outside the oocyte, respectively; Vm is the membrane potential; F, R, and T have their usual meanings. Reversal potential versus varying extracellular cation concentration (see Fig. 4) was fit with the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation: E reversal =RT/F × ln([K+]o +P × [Na+]o)/([K+]i + P × [Na+]i), whereP is the Na+ to K+ permeability ratio. Fits were performed using Sigmaplot (Jandel). Recordings were made at room temperature except tail currents, which were recorded at 11 °C using a Peltier device (Cambion). We isolated the mSlo3 cDNA from a testis cDNA library based on its homology to the large conductance calcium-activated (BK) potassium channel, mSlo1 (see “Materials and Methods”). The probe was generated from an expressed sequence tag identified in the GenBankTM data base. The new channel was termed mSlo3 (the “m” prefix denoting mouse derivation, “h” referring to the human homologue, hSlo3). Fig. 1 illustrates that the 1,112 amino acid mSlo3 protein is similar along its entire length to the 1,169 amino acid mSlo1 protein (3Butler A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L. Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) as well as DrosophilaSlo1 (dSlo1) (1Atkinson N. Robertson G. Ganetzky B. Science. 1991; 253: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 2Adelman J.P. Shen K.-Z. Kavanaugh M.P. Warren R.A. Wu Y.-N. Lagrutta A. Bond C.T. North R.A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 209-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The hydrophilicity profiles of both sequences indicate 11 hydrophobic segments, S0 through S10 (Refs. 3Butler A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L. Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar and27Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14922-14927Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 B). As with mSlo1, these can be divided into core and tail domains. Similarity between mSlo3 and mSlo1 is greatest in the core domain. The mSlo3 core (S0 through S8: mSlo3 residues 35 through 641) shares 56 and 50% identity with mSlo1 and dSlo1 cores, respectively. (Interspecies homologues mSlo1 and dSlo1 share 62% identity.) The mSlo3 tail (S9 and S10: mSlo residues 686–1136) shares 39% identity with mSlo1 and dSlo1, respectively. (The interspecies homologues mSlo1 and dSlo1 share 68% identity in this region.) A linker region having no significant conservation is found between S8 and S9. More detailed comparison of mSlo3 and mSlo1 sequences implied two functional properties of mSlo3. 1) The absence of the “calcium bowl” (18Schreiber M. Salkoff L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1355-1363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) suggested that mSlo3 may be activated by factors other than Ca2+. 2) In the K+-selective pore, a GFG motif, rather than the typical GYG, suggested differences in ionic selectivity between the two channels (28Yool A.J. Schwarz T.L. Nature. 1991; 349: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 29Hartmann H.A. Kirsch G.E. Drewe J.A. Taglialatela M. Joho R.F. Brown A.M. Science. 1991; 251: 942-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). When expressed in the Xenopusoocyte expression system, mSlo3 cRNA produced currents that were sensitive to both pH and voltage. This was demonstrated in observations of single channel behavior (Fig. 2), macroscopic currents in the patch configuration (Fig. 3), and whole cell oocyte currents recorded in the two-electrode voltage clamp mode (Fig. 4). In patches where unitary openings could be resolved, mSlo3 single-channel currents were observed to have very brief open times. Currents were sensitive to intracellular pH. Currents were small or absent at a pHi of 7.1 or lower, whereas raising pHi resulted in sharp increases in channel activity (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2, the effect of changing pH was completely and repeatedly reversible. Macroscopic currents in the inside-out patch configuration behaved consistently with single channel behavior, despite channel rundown, which occurred over the course of minutes (Fig. 3). Patches exposed to pH 7.1 produced virtually no current. However, raising the pH to 8.0 resulted in macroscopic currents that responded to depolarization and exhibited little or no inactivation. In the whole cell configuration, mSlo3 currents resembled a voltage-dependent delayed rectifier and, consistent with macroscopic currents in the patch clamp configuration, showed little or no inactivation (Fig. 4). This behavior indicates that the internal pH of oocytes must be higher than pH 7.1, consistent with previous reports that reveal resting Xenopus oocyte pH near 7.5 (30Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brändle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 31Sasaki S. Ishibashi K. Nagai T. Marumo F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1137: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Based on this assumption, it was predicted that the manipulation of internal pH would either reduce the amplitude of observed whole cell currents (after acidification) or increase the amplitude of currents (after alkalization). Thus, acidification of the oocyte using bicarbonate-based bath solution (30Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brändle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) reduced the amplitude of currents (Fig. 4 A, middle), whereas alkalization by ammonium chloride (31Sasaki S. Ishibashi K. Nagai T. Marumo F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1137: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) increased the amplitude of mSlo3 currents even after attenuation by bicarbonate (Fig. 4 A, right).Figure 3Macroscopic current traces showing sensitivity to pH but insensitivity to calcium ion. A, current traces from the same patch exposed to pH 8 with Ca2+ (filled circles), pH 8 without Ca2+ (triangles), or pH 7.1 without Ca2+ (squares). B, corresponding current-voltage (I-V) relations for the traces in A. C, calculated G-V curves for the patch in Aexposed to 100 μm Ca2+ (filled circles) or 0 Ca2+ (open triangles), both at pH 8.0. For comparison, the averaged whole-cell conductance-voltage relation was plotted (open diamonds; n = 12). This relation falls approximately 25 mV to the left of the macroscopic patch curve. Each set of points was fitted with a single Boltzmann equation. Because none of the data points approach roll-over (saturation of the conductance), the Boltzmann fits must be regarded as an estimate only. The current shown in 0 μmCa2+ at pH 7.1 (A) was restored in amplitude when the patch was again exposed to pH 8. The slight decrease in current amplitude between the two sets of traces at pH 8 was most likely due to current rundown. Holding potential was −40; on-line leak subtraction was employed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effect of calcium ion on the gating of mSlo3 currents was investigated by observing macroscopic currents in the inside-out patch configuration and exposing the cytoplasmic surface to various concentrations of Ca2+. It was found that macroscopic patch currents were unaffected by changing [Ca2+] from nominally zero (10 mm EGTA solution with no added calcium) to 100 μm Ca2+ perfused on the intracellular face (Fig. 3). As a control, the same solutions were used on inside-out patches containing mSlo1 channels instead of mSlo3. Using an identical voltage protocol, large macroscopic currents were evoked at 100 μm, but currents were absent in zero calcium conditions (data not shown; see also Ref. 18Schreiber M. Salkoff L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1355-1363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). mSlo3 single-channel conductance was observed to be 90 picosiemens as measured in asymmetric potassium concentrations (Fig. 2) and 106 in symmetric high K+ (data not shown). This is considerably lower than that seen for mSlo1 (270 picosiemens) measured in symmetric high k+ (3Butler A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L. Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Unlike mSlo1, mSlo3 is relatively insensitive to tetraethylammonium. mSlo3 channels were tested for external TEA sensitivity in the whole cell, two-electrode recording mode. Oocytes expressing mSlo3 cRNA were stepped from −40 to +80 mV while several concentrations of TEA were added sequentially to the bath. A plot of current versus TEA concentration at +60 mV revealed an EC50 of 49 mm (data not shown). In contrast, mSlo1 is approximately 350-fold more sensitive (having an EC50 of 0.14 mm) (3Butler A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L. Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). One conspicuous difference in sequence between mSlo3 and mSlo1 occurs in a region implicated in ion selectivity. All channels with high selectivity for potassium over sodium have a GYG sequence motif in the “P” region (28Yool A.J. Schwarz T.L. Nature. 1991; 349: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 29Hartmann H.A. Kirsch G.E. Drewe J.A. Taglialatela M. Joho R.F. Brown A.M. Science. 1991; 251: 942-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In contrast, mSlo3 has a GFG at this location (Fig. 1, residue 279). It was previously shown in a Shaker K+ channel that substitution of F (Phe) for Y (Tyr) in the GYG sequence decreased selectivity for K+ over Na+ (32Heginbotham L. MacKinnon R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). This suggested that mSlo3 could have less selectivity for K+ over Na+ than most potassium channels. To test this possibility, we analyzed the reversal potential for mSlo3 current tails at various concentrations of external potassium and sodium ion (Fig. 4). Our results showed that mSlo3 is less selective for K+ over Na+ than Slo1, having aP K/P Na of approximately 5versus >50 for Slo1 (3Butler A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L. Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 5Tseng-Crank J. Foster C.D. Krause J.D. Mertz R. Godinot N. DiChiara T. Reinhart P.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1315-1330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Figs.5, A and B, show results from RT-PCR performed on RNA from brain, skeletal muscle, lung, liver, kidney, and heart; only testis produced a positive signal. Northern blots using total RNA from the same tissues gave a robust signal after only 4 h of exposure. A transcript of approximately 4 kb was seen only in testis (Fig. 5). A longer exposure (18 h) failed to reveal bands from any additional tissues (data not shown). Northern analysis of a human tissue blot also revealed a band at 4 kb, indicating the presence of a human Slo3 homologue of a conserved transcript size. The human Northern blot similarly indicated a restricted tissue distribution (Fig. 5). The small message size is unusual for a gene encoding such a large protein. Apparently, there may be as little as 700 bp of 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions. This small message size contrasts with the larger message size of mSlo1, which is more than twice as large in brain (3Butler A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L. Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Preliminary sequence data indicates hSlo3 is highly conserved at the molecular level. In testis, in situhybridization revealed that mSlo3 message is expressed in the seminiferous tubules with the signal directly over developing spermatocytes (Fig. 6). The message is most abundant in the inner segments of these rings, corresponding to positions over maturing spermatocytes and possibly to early spermatids. The outermost regions of these rings contain spermatogonia, the stem cell from which spermatocytes are derived. The absence of hybridization (arrow in Fig. 6) in the peripheral areas suggests that expression is restricted to later stages of spermatogenesis. The absence of message in the interstices between rings also suggests that the nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissue in these regions of the testis probably lack expression of mSlo3. Sensitivity to both intracellular alkalization and membrane depolarization distinguishes mSlo3 from other cloned channels. Previous reports demonstrate that other channels from various tissues are sensitive to pHi, but their functional properties as well as their tissue distributions differ from mSlo3. One example is the acid-sensing channel (ASIC), which opens upon intracellular acidification (33Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1996; 386: 173-177Crossref Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). These channels are present in dorsal root ganglia and are involved in pain sensation. The ASIC channel is in the amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel degenerin family and is not similar to K+ channels. In contrast, TASK and RACTK1 are in the K+ channel superfamily but lack the S4 voltage sensor and do not respond to membrane potential changes. TASK is a recently cloned, four-transmembrane domain channel responsive to extracellular proton concentrations in the physiological range; it is presumed that the TASK channel contributes to the resting K+ conductance (34Duprat F.

https://openalex.org/W2170245408,"In a preceding paper, we reported a novel actin filament (F-actin)-binding protein, named neurabin, which was specifically expressed in neural tissue and implicated in neurite formation. We purified from rat brain another F-actin-binding protein, which had a domain organization similar to that of neurabin but was ubiquitously expressed, and named it neurabin-II. The original neurabin, renamed neurabin-I, had 1095 amino acids and a calculated<i>M</i> <sub>r</sub> of 122,729, whereas neurabin-II had 817 amino acids and a calculated <i>M</i> <sub>r</sub> of 89,642. Both neurabin-I and -II had one F-actin-binding domain at the N-terminal region, one PDZ domain at the middle region, a domain known to interact with transmembrane proteins, and domains predicted to form coiled-coil structures at the C-terminal region. Both neurabin-I and -II bound along the sides of F-actin and showed F-actin-cross-linking activity. The subcellular distribution analysis indicated that neurabin-II was enriched at the postsynaptic density fraction in rat brain and the adherens junction fraction in rat liver. Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis revealed that neurabin-II was highly concentrated at the synapse in primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons and at the cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion sites in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Neurabin-II turned out to be the same as a recently reported protein phosphatase 1-binding protein named spinophilin. These results suggest that neurabin-II/spinophilin plays an important role in linking the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2029665946,"Nitric oxide (NO), a physiologically important activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), is synthesized from l-arginine and O2 in a reaction catalyzed by NO synthases (NOS). Previous studies with purified NOS failed to detect formation of free NO, presumably due to a fast inactivation of NO by simultaneously produced superoxide (O·̄2). To characterize the products involved in NOS-induced sGC activation, we measured the formation of cyclic 3′,5′-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by purified sGC incubated in the absence and presence of GSH (1 mm) with drugs releasing different NO-related species or with purified neuronal NOS. Basal sGC activity was 0.04 ± 0.01 and 0.19 ± 0.06 μmol of cGMP × mg−1 × min−1 without and with 1 mm GSH, respectively. The NO donor DEA/NO activated sGC in a GSH-independent manner. Peroxynitrite had no effect in the absence of GSH but significantly stimulated the enzyme in the presence of the thiol (3.45 ± 0.60 μmol of cGMP × mg−1 × min−1). The NO/O·̄2 donor SIN-1 caused only a slight accumulation of cGMP in the absence of GSH but was almost as effective as DEA/NO in the presence of the thiol. The profile of sGC activation by Ca2+/calmodulin-activated NOS resembled that of SIN-1; at a maximally active concentration of 200 ng/0.1 ml, NOS increased sGC activity to 1.22 ± 0.12 and 8.51 ± 0.88 μmol of cGMP × mg−1 × min−1 in the absence and presence of GSH, respectively. The product of NOS and GSH was identified as the thionitrite GSNO, which activated sGC through Cu+-catalyzed release of free NO. In contrast to S-nitrosation by peroxynitrite, the novel NO/O·̄2-triggered pathway was very efficient (25–45% GSNO) and insensitive to CO2. Cu+-specific chelators inhibited bradykinin-induced cGMP release from rat isolated hearts but did not interfere with the direct activation of cardiac sGC, suggesting that thionitrites may occur as intermediates of NO/cGMP signaling in mammalian tissues. Nitric oxide (NO), a physiologically important activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), is synthesized from l-arginine and O2 in a reaction catalyzed by NO synthases (NOS). Previous studies with purified NOS failed to detect formation of free NO, presumably due to a fast inactivation of NO by simultaneously produced superoxide (O·̄2).

The profile of sGC activation by Ca2+/calmodulin-activated NOS resembled that of SIN-1; at a maximally active concentration of 200 ng/0.1 ml, NOS increased sGC activity to 1.22 ± 0.12 and 8.51 ± 0.88 μmol of cGMP × mg−1 × min−1 in the absence and presence of GSH, respectively. The product of NOS and GSH was identified as the thionitrite GSNO, which activated sGC through Cu+-catalyzed release of free NO. In contrast to S-nitrosation by peroxynitrite, the novel NO/O·̄2-triggered pathway was very efficient (25–45% GSNO) and insensitive to CO2. Cu+-specific chelators inhibited bradykinin-induced cGMP release from rat isolated hearts but did not interfere with the direct activation of cardiac sGC, suggesting that thionitrites may occur as intermediates of NO/cGMP signaling in mammalian tissues. The NO/cGMP pathway involving NO-mediated activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (GTP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.2.; sGC 1The abbreviations used are: sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase; BCS, bathocuproine sulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; DEA/NO, 2,2-diethyl-1-nitroso-oxyhydrazine; GSNO, S-nitrosoglutathione; H4biopterin, (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin;l-NNA, N G-nitro-l-arginine; NO−, nitroxyl anion; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; SIN-1, 3-(4-morpholinyl)-sydnonimine; SPER/NO, spermine/NO; SOD, superoxide dismutase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. ) is essential to signal transduction in several biological systems (1Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In the vasculature, NO/cGMP signaling is important for the regulation of blood pressure and platelet function (2Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar); in the brain, this pathway controls the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate and acetylcholine (3Garthwaite J. Boulton C.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 683-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of NO is triggered by autacoids increasing the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+, resulting in activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent NOS (EC1.14.13.39), complex homodimeric enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of NO from the guanidino moiety of the amino acid l-arginine (4Marletta M.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 927-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 5Mayer B.

The oxidation of l-arginine is catalyzed by a cytochrome P450-type heme iron in the oxygenase domain of NOS with O2 serving as a cosubstrate. The electrons required for reduction of O2 are shuttled from the cofactor NADPH to the heme via a flavin-containing cytochrome P450reductase that forms the C-terminal half of the NOS protein. This electron transport chain only operates when Ca2+/calmodulin is bound to the enzyme, which then effects the Ca2+regulation of endothelial and neuronal NO synthesis. At low concentrations of l-arginine or in its absence, the enzymatic reduction of O2 uncouples from substrate oxidation and results in the generation of superoxide anions and H2O2 (8Mayer B. John M. Heinzel B. Werner E.R. Wachter H. Schultz G. Böhme E. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 9Heinzel B. John M. Klatt P. Böhme E. Mayer B. Biochem.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12589-12593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effective coupling of the reaction requires not only saturation with l-arginine but also the pteridine cofactor H4biopterin (13Mayer B. Werner E.R. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1995; 351: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Since the two subunits of neuronal NOS bind H4biopterin in a highly anticooperative manner, the purified enzyme always contains ≤1 molecule of H4biopterin/dimer, i.e. it consists of a H4biopterin-containing and a H4biopterin-free subunit (14Gorren A.C.F. List B.M. Schrammel A. Pitters E. Hemmens B. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16735-16745Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In this state, the enzyme can form l-citrulline and is stimulated about 2-fold upon binding of H4biopterin to the low affinity site of the pteridine-free subunit. Together with our recent findings that the two NOS subunits function independently (15Gorren A.C.F. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4360-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), this very unusual binding behavior of H4biopterin appears to have interesting functional consequences; at low concentrations of free H4biopterin, the H4biopterin-containing subunit of NOS is expected to form NO, whereas the uncoupled NADPH oxidation catalyzed by the pteridine-free subunit should generate O·̄2, which reacts at a nearly diffusion-controlled rate (k = 4.3–6.7 × 109m−1s−1) with NO to form peroxynitrite, a powerful oxidant and cytotoxic species (16Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 40: C1424-C1437Crossref Google Scholar). In keeping with the hypothesis that simultaneous production of NO and O·̄2 is an intrinsic activity of NOS, the enzyme does not catalyze formation of free NO unless high concentrations of SOD are present to outcompete the peroxynitrite reaction (17Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 655-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 18Schmidt H.H.H.W. Hofmann H. Schindler U. Shutenko Z.S. Cunningham D.D. Feelisch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14492-14497Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The simultaneous production of NO and O·̄2could be important to prevent feedback inhibition of the enzyme by free NO (19Griscavage J.M. Fukuto J.M. Komori Y. Ignarro L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21644-21649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of saturating concentrations of H4biopterin, which prevent enzymatic O·̄2 formation due to coupling of NADPH and l-arginine oxidation, NO becomes inactivated by O·̄2 formed non-enzymatically by autoxidation of H4biopterin (17Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 655-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Davies M.D. Kaufman S. Milstien S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As an alternative explanation of these puzzling results, it has been suggested that the true product of NOS is NO− (18Schmidt H.H.H.W. Hofmann H. Schindler U. Shutenko Z.S. Cunningham D.D. Feelisch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14492-14497Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), which could be converted to NO by stoichiometric amounts of SOD (21Murphy M.E. Sies H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10860-10864Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). NO was shown to be the only redox form of nitrogen monoxide capable of activating sGC (22Dierks E.A. Burstyn J.N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), raising the question of how the NO signal is carried from NOS to sGC. A possible mediator is peroxynitrite acting via the nitrosation of GSH to GSNO. Although this reaction is inefficient and yields maximally 1% GSNO (23Moro M.A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Goodwin D.A. Read N.G. Zamorapino R. Feelisch M. Radomski M.W. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6702-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 24Mayer B. Schrammel A. Klatt P. Koesling D. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17355-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), there could be as yet unrecognized more efficient nitrosative pathways accounting for GSNO biosynthesis in vivo. Alternatively, cells may contain sufficient SOD to prevent inactivation of NO by O·̄2. As it is difficult to predict which of these pathways is involved in the true chemical route of NOS/sGC signaling, we have designed an in vitro study using a reconstituted system consisting of purified neuronal NOS and purified sGC. This system allowed us to compare the action profile of NOS with that of donor compounds of several nitrogen oxides and to study the activation of sGC by active NOS in the presence of GSH and SOD. Our study yielded several unexpected results. Most importantly, the data uncover a novel NO/O·̄2-triggered nitrosative pathway that outcompetes the reaction of O·̄2 with both NO and SOD. Purified recombinant rat neuronal NOS was obtained from baculovirus-infected insect cells as described (25Harteneck C. Klatt P. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). sGC was purified from bovine lung by immunoaffinity chromatography as described previously (26Humbert P. Niroomand F. Fischer G. Mayer B. Koesling D. Hinsch K.-D. Gausepohl H. Frank R. Schultz G. Böhme E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Alkaline stock solutions of peroxynitrite (80–100 mm) were prepared and quantified as described (27Pfeiffer S. Gorren A.C.F. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Hansert B. Bohle D.S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3465-3470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). l-[2,3,4,5-3H]Arginine hydrochloride (57 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]GTP (400 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham, purchased through MedPro (Vienna, Austria). DEA/NO, SPER/NO, Angeli's salt, and GSNO were obtained from Alexis (Läufelfingen, Switzerland). SIN-1 was a generous gift from Dr. K. Schönafinger (Höchst Marion Rousell Inc., Frankfurt, Germany). H4Biopterin was from Dr. B. Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland) and NADPH from Boehringer Mannheim (Vienna, Austria). Other chemicals including Cu,Zn-SOD (specific activity 4,200 units/mg) were from Sigma (Vienna, Austria). Rat hearts were isolated and retrogradely perfused with Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer at 9.0 ml × min−1 × g−1 wet weight as described previously (28Brunner F. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 1953-1963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After equilibration (45 min), hearts were perfused via side line for 15 min with bradykinin (0.1 μm) or SPER/NO (0.1 mm), followed by perfusion (15 min) with l-NNA (0.2 mm), the copper ion-selective chelators neocuproine or BCS (both Cu+-selective), or cuprizone (Cu2+-selective) (all chelators at 0.2 mm) in the absence of agonists. Finally, agonists were perfused together with copper chelators orl-NNA, again over 15 min. Coronary effluent samples were collected in 3-min intervals during the first and last period of 15 min, i.e. the agonist infusion periods, and stored at −20 °C pending analysis by radioimmunoassay. HPLC analysis of GSNO was performed on a C18 reversed phase column with 20 mmphosphate buffer (pH 3.0), containing 20 μm neocuproine to prevent GSNO decomposition, at 1 ml/min and detection at 338 nm as described (24Mayer B. Schrammel A. Klatt P. Koesling D. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17355-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To remove nitrite, samples were treated with 10 μl of ammonium sulfamate (10 mm) prior to acidification (pH ∼3). Calibration curves were established with GSNO under enzyme assay conditions. GSNO was not detectable in samples containing up to 0.1 mm NaNO2. For a more sensitive determination of GSNO, NO was released by addition of Cu(NO3)2 (29Gorren A.C.F. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and quantified with an NO electrode connected to an Apple Macintosh computer via an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter (World Precision Instruments, Mauer, Germany) (17Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 655-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The output current was recorded at 0.6 Hz under constant stirring at 37 °C in open glass vials. For calibration, Cu(NO3)2 (10 mm final) was added to GSNO under NOS/sGC assay conditions (see below). Linear calibration curves were obtained from plots of the NO versus the GSNO (0.05–5 μm) concentration. GSNO was not detectable in samples containing up to 50 μm NaNO2. As described in detail elsewhere, 2S. Pfeiffer, A. Schrammel, K. Schmidt, and B. Mayer, submitted for publication. this method is selective for thionitrites but does not allow the specific detection of GSNO in biological samples where sulfhydryls other than GSH may be present. In some experiments, the total concentration of nitrosothiols was determined spectrophotometrically according to the method of Saville (30Saville B. Analyst. 1958; 83: 670-672Crossref Google Scholar). Stock solutions of purified bovine lung sGC (v max = ∼ 16 μmol of cGMP × mg−1 × min−1) were diluted to 250-fold final concentrations (0.125 mg/ml) with chilled 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. 0.4 μl of the diluted enzyme (50 ng) was added to 89.6 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), containing 0.55 mm [α-32P]GTP (∼200,000 cpm), 3.3 mm MgCl2, 1.1 mm cGMP, 0.11 mml-arginine, 55 μm NADPH, 11 μm CaCl2, and 1.1 μg of calmodulin. GSH, SOD, drugs, and NaHCO3 were present as indicated. Reactions were started by addition of 0.5–500 ng of purified NOS (v max = 0.7–0.9 μmol ofl-citrulline × mg−1 × min−1) in 10 μl of a chilled 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.4 mm CHAPS, followed by incubation of the samples at 37 °C for 10 min, and isolation of [32P]cGMP as described (31Schultz G. Böhme E. Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Graßl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1984: 379-389Google Scholar). Where indicated, sGC was incubated with donor compounds instead of NOS under identical conditions. Specific NOS activity measured as formation of [3H]citrulline from [3H]arginine (32Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) was 0.08–0.1 μmol of l-citrulline × mg−1min−1 when determined under identical conditions but with [3H]arginine (∼50,000 counts per min) being present instead of [α-32P]GTP. For electrochemical, photometrical, and HPLC determination of GSNO together with [3H]citrulline in the same samples, 20 μg of NOS were incubated in a total volume of 1 ml in open glass vials, followed by the removal of aliquots required for the various analyses and addition of Cu(NO3)2 for the electrochemical quantification of GSNO. To allow a reliable comparison of the effects of NO donors with that of the enzymatic NOS product(s), determination of sGC activity was performed in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mm GTP, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm cGMP, 0.1 mml-arginine, 50 μm NADPH, 10 μm CaCl2, and 10 μg/ml calmodulin. Under these conditions, NOS activity was 0.08–0.1 μmol of l-citrulline × mg−1 × min−1, whether or not GSH (1 mm) was present. In the absence of added NO, purified sGC exhibited basal activities of 0.04 ± 0.01 and 0.19 ± 0.06 μmol of cGMP × mg−1 × min−1 without and with 1 mm GSH, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, cGMP formation was increased about 300-fold to 12.32 ± 0.55 μmol of cGMP × mg−1× min−1 by the NO donor DEA/NO (1 μm); the identical maximal enzyme activity was obtained in the presence of GSH. Peroxynitrite (0.1 mm) had no effect in the absence of the thiol but led to a moderate enzyme stimulation (about 20-fold) when incubated with 1 mm GSH. The effect of the NO/O·̄2donor SIN-1 (33Feelisch M. Ostrowski J. Noack E. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1989; 14: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) differed considerably from that of peroxynitrite. At a concentration of 10 μm, SIN-1 produced only a slight enzyme stimulation in the absence of GSH (1.01 ± 0.19 μmol of cGMP × mg−1 × min−1) but was nearly as effective as DEA/NO in the presence of the thiol (9.50 ± 1.01 μmol of cGMP × mg−1 × min−1). The nitroxyl donor Angeli's salt decomposes with a half-time close to that of DEA/NO (t½ at 37 °C and pH 7.4 = 2.1 and 2.3 min, respectively) (34Maragos C.M. Morley D. Wink D.A. Dunams T.M. Saavedra J.E. Hoffman A. Bove A.A. Isaac L. Hrabie J.A. Keefer L.K. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). At 10 μm, i.e. a concentration that yields 10-fold higher rates of product release than the maximally active concentration of DEA/NO (1 μm), Angeli's salt produced only little effects in the absence and presence of GSH (0.64 ± 0.09 and 1.46 ± 0.29 μmol of cGMP × mg−1 × min−1, respectively). The effects of the nitrogen oxide donors were compared with that of Ca2+/calmodulin-activated neuronal NOS (containing ∼0.4 eq of H4biopterin/monomer) coincubated with sGC at saturating concentrations of l-arginine but in the absence of exogenous H4biopterin. At a maximally effective concentration of 200 ng/0.1 ml, NOS stimulated sGC to 1.22 ± 0.12 μmol of cGMP × mg−1 × min−1 in the absence of GSH but led to a pronounced accumulation of cGMP in the presence of the thiol (8.51 ± 0.88 μmol of cGMP × mg−1 × min−1). GSH triggered sGC activation by NOS with an EC50 value of 0. 21 ± 0.06 mm (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 A, presence of SOD led to an apparently GSH-independent activation of sGC by NOS (200 ng/0.1 ml). The effective concentrations of SOD (EC50 = 0.66 ± 0.13 unit/ml) were about 200-fold lower than those required to detect free NO under the same conditions (EC50 = 135 ± 7 units/ml; data not shown). Identical data were obtained with MnSOD fromEscherichia coli (data not shown). In the presence of GSH, SOD increased NOS-stimulated cGMP formation to 13.74 ± 1.28 μmol × mg−1 × min−1, a value close to that obtained with DEA/NO (cf. Fig. 1). As evident from the concentration-response curves shown in Fig. 2 B, the system was highly sensitive to NOS. In the presence of GSH, the Ca2+/calmodulin-activated enzyme stimulated sGC with an EC50 value of 22.5 ± 7.5 ng/0.1 ml (0.7 nm) (filled circles). SOD (unfilled squares) decreased the EC50 of NOS to 2.2 ± 0.6 ng/0.1 ml. The slight increase of basal sGC activity (2.56 ± 0.74 μmol of cGMP × mg−1 × min−1) was inhibited by hemoglobin and the heme-site inhibitor ODQ (35Schrammel A. Behrends S. Schmidt K. Koesling D. Mayer B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown), indicating that it was due to stabilization of ambient NO (36Friebe A. Malkewitz J. Schultz G. Koesling D. Nature. 1996; 382: 120Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). If SOD and GSH were present together (filled squares), the resulting EC50 (8.2 ± 1.2 ng of NOS/0.1 ml) was between the values obtained with either SOD or GSH alone. The surprising difference between sGC activation by NO/O·̄2 (generated by NOS or SIN-1) and peroxynitrite (cf. Fig. 1) prompted us to perform further experiments to better define their respective modes of action and to characterize possible intermediates of these pathways. Very similar data to those described below were obtained when sGC was activated with the NO/O·̄2 donor SIN-1 instead of NOS. 3A. Schrammel, S. Pfeiffer, D. Koesling, K. Schmidt, and B. Mayer, submitted for publication. Under physiological conditions, the reactivity of peroxynitrite is dramatically modified by its rapid reaction with CO2 (37Lymar S.V. Hurst J.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8867-8868Crossref Scopus (498) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, CO2(delivered as NaHCO3) almost completely blocked GSH-dependent activation of sGC by peroxynitrite (A) but only slightly reduced cGMP accumulation triggered by NOS (B). Since latter effect was also observed when DEA/NO was used to activate sGC (data not shown), NaHCO3 and/or CO2 apparently slightly interfere with NO stimulation of sGC. These data showed that the GSH-dependent activation of sGC by the NOS products NO/O·̄2 is not mediated by peroxynitrite, indicating that peroxynitrite formation is at least partially outcompeted by a rapid reaction of NO/O·̄2 with GSH to an intermediate with NO-like biological activity. The thionitrite GSNO appeared to be a likely candidate. This compound is not a direct activator of sGC but releases free NO in the presence of trace amounts of Cu2+ and reducing agents such as thiols or ascorbate (24Mayer B. Schrammel A. Klatt P. Koesling D. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17355-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 29Gorren A.C.F. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We analyzed the product of NOS and GSH by HPLC and obtained a peak with an absorbance maximum at 338 nm, which co-eluted with authentic GSNO (Fig. 4). GSNO formation triggered by NO/O·̄2 was unlikely to be catalyzed by trace metals because neocuproine (20 μm) was present throughout the experiments and neither EDTA (10 mm), nor diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (50 μm), nor cuprizone (50 μm) had any effect on GSNO formation from SIN-1 and GSH (1 mm each) (data not shown). Because EDTA and diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid inhibited NOS activity measured as formation of l-citrulline (data not shown), these chelators could not be tested in the NOS/GSH system. Enzymatic formation of an S-nitrosothiol was further confirmed by incubation of NOS in the presence of 1 mm GSH and electrochemical detection of NO release by treating the samples with Cu(NO3)2 (Fig. 5 A). In agreement with previous studies (17Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 655-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 18Schmidt H.H.H.W. Hofmann H. Schindler U. Shutenko Z.S. Cunningham D.D. Feelisch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14492-14497Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), Ca2+/calmodulin-activated NOS did not produce detectable amounts of free NO. However, a pronounced NO signal was obtained when Cu(NO3)2 was added to the incubation mixtures 6 min later. The shape of the signal was identical to that obtained by addition of Cu(NO3)2 to authentic GSNO, and Cu(NO3)2 was without effect when NOS was incubated in the absence of a thiol (data not shown). Together with the HPLC data, these results strongly suggested that incubation of NOS with GSH led to formation of GSNO, which released NO in a copper-dependent reaction. The enzymatic formation of GSNO was insensitive to NaHCO3 (Fig. 5 A), in marked contrast to the nitrosation reaction triggered by ONOO−(Fig. 5 B). The same differential effects of NaHCO3 were observed when GSNO was analyzed by HPLC (data not shown). The electrochemical method was used to quantify GSNO formation by NOS incubated in the presence of 1 mm GSH. To compare the values with NOS activity, formation of l-citrulline was determined in the same samples. As shown in Fig. 6, formation of GSNO depended on the enzyme concentration and accounted for 25–45% of thel-citrulline production. For instance, at a NOS concentration of 100 ng/0.1 ml, which produced ∼80% of maximal sGC stimulation (cf. Fig. 2 B), NOS generated 0.61 ± 0.12 μml-citrulline and 0.23 ± 0.03 μm GSNO. Since authentic GSNO stimulated sGC under identical conditions with an EC50 of 0.35 ± 0.06 μm (data not shown), these data suggest that sGC activation by NOS is explained by enzymatic formation of GSNO. Incubation of NOS at a high concentration (2,000 ng/0.1 ml) but under otherwise identical conditions allowed the quantitative determination of GSNO with additional, less sensitive analytical techniques and a comparison of these values with the formation ofl-citrulline. Within 10 min, the enzyme converted 0.1 mm [3H]arginine to 14 μm[3H]citrulline; the corresponding concentrations of GSNO were 2.52 ± 0.24 μm (NO electrode), 2.68 ± 0.30 μm (HPLC), and 2.53 ± 0.70 μm(photometrical determination of thionitrites). S-Nitrosation triggered by peroxynitrite occurs at low yields (23Moro M.A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Goodwin D.A. Read N.G. Zamorapino R. Feelisch M. Radomski M.W. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Figs. 3 and 5), suggesting that it may not represent an important pathway of NO/cGMP signaling in vivo. However, the present data show that S-nitrosation by NOS is efficient at physiologically low enzyme concentrations and not inhibited by CO2. Thus, the novel NO/O·̄2-triggered nitrosative pathway described here could be physiologically relevant. To study the possible contribution of GSNO as an intermediate in the NO/cGMP signal transduction cascade, we decided to test whether inhibition of non-enzymatic GSNO decomposition by chelators of copper ions affects agonist-induced cGMP formation in a perfused isolated rat heart system. As shown in Fig. 7 A, the endothelium-dependent vasodilator bradykinin stimulated aN G-nitro-l-arginine (l-NNA)-sensitive release of cGMP into the coronary effluent, which was strongly inhibited by the Cu+-selective chelators neocuproine and BCS but not by the Cu2+ chelator cuprizone (38Gordge M.P.

To exclude that these effects were due to an interference of the drugs with sGC stimulation or cGMP outward transport, similar experiments were performed with the NONOate SPER/NO, which is expected to activate cardiac sGC directly. Release of cGMP triggered by the NO donor was not affected by neocuproine or by cuprizone (Fig. 7 B), demonstrating that Cu+-specific chelators are specific inhibitors of agonist-induced cGMP release from rat heart. The present study was designed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in cGMP accumulation triggered by Ca2+-activated NOS. Purified sGC was functionally reconstituted with purified neuronal NOS or incubated with donors of nitrogen oxides to learn about the conditions required for the effective transduction of the NOS signal and the identity of the intermediates involved.

The glutathione S-transferase genes in this cluster are spaced about 20 kilobase pairs (kb) apart, and arranged as 5′-GSTM4–GSTM2–GSTM1–GSTM5-3′. This map has been used to localize the end points of the polymorphicGSTM1 deletion. The left repeated region is 5 kb downstream from the 3′-end of the GSTM2 gene and 5 kb upstream from the beginning of the GSTM1 gene; the right repeated region is 5 kb downstream from the 3′-end of the GSTM1 and 10 kb upstream from the 5′-end of the GSTM5 gene. TheGSTM1-0 deletion produces a novel 7.4-kbHindIII fragment with the loss of 10.3- and 11.4-kbHindIII fragments. The same novel fragment was seen in 13 unrelated individuals (20 null alleles), suggesting that mostGSTM1-0 deletions involve recombinations between the same two regions. We have cloned and sequenced the deletion junction that is produced at the GSTM1-null locus; the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions are more than 99% identical to each other and to the deletion junction sequence over 2.3 kb. Because of the high sequence identity between the left repeat, right repeat, and deletion junction regions, the crossing over cannot be localized within the 2.3-kb region. The 2.3-kb repeated region contains a reverse class IV Alu repetitive element near one end of the repeat.

The glutathione S-transferases (EC 2.5.1.18) are a superfamily of catalytic and binding proteins that detoxify chemical carcinogens (1Rushmore T.H. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11475-11478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based primarily on protein sequence similarity, the soluble glutathione S-transferases have been divided into four protein families: classes Alpha, Mu, Pi, and Theta. Class Alpha and Mu families typically contain four or more members in mammalian genomes. In humans, a large fraction of the population carries polymorphic deletions for the class Mu GSTM1 gene (about 50% of the population is homozygous GSTM1-null; Ref. 2Suzuki T. Coggan M. Shaw D.C.

Daly A.K. Cooper J. Navidi W.C. Carpenter C.L. Idle J.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 1246-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) on the effect of the GSTM1 deletion and lung cancer among caucasians and African Americans in southern California suggests that, in these populations at least, the association of the GSTM1-0 deletion and cancer is not strong. London et al. (6London S.J. Daly A.K. Cooper J. Navidi W.C. Carpenter C.L. Idle J.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 1246-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) found a significant association between lung cancer and the GSTM1deletion only in cancer patients with a history of smoking but who had smoked less than 40 pack-years (e.g. 2 packs/day for 20 years) (odds ratio = 1.77, 95% CI 1The abbreviations used are: CI, confidence interval; kb, kilobase pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; YAC, yeast artificial chromosomes; GST, glutathioneS-transferase. = 1.11–2.82). After regression to remove age, sex, and smoking history effects, no significant association was found for total lung cancer cases or for cases where the patient had smoked more than 40 pack-years. These authors reviewed the literature on lung cancer and the GSTM1deletion and argue that while an association may be present, it is not strong for caucasian and African American populations. However, a meta-analysis by McWilliams et al. (12McWilliams J.E. Sanderson B.J. Harris E.L. Richert-Boe K.E. Henner W.D. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 1995; 4: 589-594PubMed Google Scholar) comes to the opposite conclusion. They examined 12 case/control studies with a total of 1593 cases and 2135 controls and concluded that GSTM1-0 is a moderate risk factor with an odds ratio of 1.41 (95% CI = 1.23–1.61), accounting for about 17% of lung cancer cases (12McWilliams J.E. Sanderson B.J. Harris E.L. Richert-Boe K.E. Henner W.D. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 1995; 4: 589-594PubMed Google Scholar). Although there is a substantial literature on epidemiological associations between the GSTM1-0 deletion and cancer, very little is known about the structure of the deletion. We do not know the size of the deletion or whether other expressed genes are lost. Likewise, the mechanism of the GSTM1-0 deletion is unknown. In this paper, we present a physical map of four of the five class Mu genes in the GSTM cluster on chromosome 1 and show that theGSTM1-0 deletion apparently results from homologous unequal crossing over between two highly identical regions that flank theGSTM1 gene, resulting in a 15-kb deletion that contains the entire GSTM1 gene. The GSTM1 gene and 5′- and 3′-flanking regions are excised relatively precisely, leaving the flanking GSTM4, GSTM2, GSTM5, and GSTM3 genes intact. There is no change in at least 5 kb 3′ to the 5′-flanking GSTM2 gene or in at least 10 kb 5′- to the 3′-flanking GSTM5 gene. In addition, the same deletion has occurred in all of the deleted alleles examined. Identification of the GSTM1-0 recombination region provides a hybridization probe that can be used to distinguish GSTM1+/− heterozygotes from GSTM1+/+ homozygotes. [α-35S]dATP, [α-32P]dCTP and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from ICN Biochemicals. Restriction enzymes were obtained either from Life Technologies, Inc. or New England Biolabs. T4 DNA ligase and λ-HindIII molecular size markers were obtained from Life Technologies.

Patterson D. Am. J. Human Genet. 1993; 53: 220-233PubMed Google Scholar. Yeast and cosmid DNAs were prepared using standard methods (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 14Pearson W.R. Vorachek W.R. Xu S. Berger R. Hart I. Vannais D. Patterson D. Am. J. Human Genet. 1993; 53: 220-233PubMed Google Scholar). Southern blotting was done as described (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Restriction enzyme digestions were performed as suggested by the manufacturers. Restriction enzyme-digested DNA samples were electrophoresed on a 0.6% agarose gel. For DNA transfer, the gel was treated with 0.25 m HCl for 10 min and then denatured with 0.5 m NaOH, 1.5m NaCl for 1 h and neutralized with 0.5 mTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.5 m NaCl for 1 h. DNA was transferred in 10 × SSC overnight to Zetabind (AMF-Cuno) and fixed to the membrane by UV irradiation. Southern blots to nylon membranes were hybridized with random primer-labeled probe at 65 °C in 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer and washed at 65 °C in 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer according to Church and Gilbert (15Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). Hybridization probes containing repeated DNA sequences (probes P1 and P2; Fig. 4) were prehybridized with human COT-1 DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. A probe/COT-1 DNA mixture was boiled for 5 min, incubated at 65 °C for 1 h, and then added to the hybridization bag. The hybridization was allowed to proceed at 65 °C for 48 h, and the membrane was washed as usual (15Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). Conventional PCRs were performed in 100 μl of 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 0.1% Triton X-100, a 200 mm concentration of each dNTP, a 1 mm concentration of each primer, and 3.5 units ofTaq polymerase for 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 55 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. The final cycle was followed by incubation at 72 °C for another 10 min. PCR products to be cloned were treated with Klenow fragment to produce flush ends. High molecular weight GSTM-YAC2 yeast genomic DNA was isolated as described by Guthrie et al. (16Phillippsen P. Stotz A. Scherf C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). High molecular weight chromosomal DNA was size-fractionated on a preparative sucrose gradient (5–20% sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mmNa2EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl, and 0.1% Sarkosyl). Fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel; fractions with very little low molecular weight DNA were pooled, dialyzed, and concentrated by CsCl density gradient centrifugation. Fractions from the CsCl gradient were collected, a portion was electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel, and fractions containing only high molecular weight DNA were used forSauIIIA partial digestion. SauIIIA partially digested yeast DNA was size-fractionated on a 5–25% NaCl gradient, and fractions containing DNA enriched in sizes between 35–45 kb were cloned into BamHI-cut pWE15 vector. Packaging and infection was performed using the Gigapack II XL kit as recommended by the supplier. The resulting GSTM-YAC2 cosmid library was screened as in Ref. 13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar. The hybridization probe was the insert from the PCR-generated clone containing the 3′-immediate flanking sequence of GSTM2. This probe cross-hybridizes with the 3′-flanking region of GSTM1. Colonies that displayed positive signals on both replica membranes were picked up from the master plates and screened a second time at a density of 50 colonies/10-cm membrane. Duplicate replica membranes were made, and colony hybridization was undertaken as before. Single positive colonies were grown for cosmid DNA minipreparations (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) through two more cycles before final storage. T3 and T7 oligonucleotides (Stratagene) were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase as described (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Twenty pmol of each oligonucleotide was used in each labeling reaction. After labeling, the oligonucleotides were purified by ethanol precipitation once and then dissolved in TE (pH 8.0). Cosmid mapping was performed according to the procedure provided in the manual of Stratagene's FLASH Nonradioactive Gene Mapping kit (except that γ-32P-end-labeled radioactive T3 and T7 oligonucleotides were used as probes). The cosmid DNA was prepared using QIAGEN's Plasmid Mega kit. For obtaining highest quality of DNA, an extra ethanol precipitation step was employed to reduce the salt concentration of the DNA preparation. Partial EcoRI and HindIII digestions of cosmid DNAs were separated on 0.4% agarose gels. A GeneAmp XL PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer) was used to amplify a 7.4-kb HindIII junction fragment with the following primers: primer 1, 5′-CCTGACCTTCCTTCCTGTTAGTGGT-3′; and primer 2, 5′-GATGTCCCAGTACCCCAGAGTCATG-3′. Primer 1 anneals to the 3′-end ofGSTM2; primer 2 anneals to the 5′-end of GSTM5. Long range PCR reactions were performed in a 100-μl solution of 1 × buffer (supplied with the PCR kit), a 200 μmconcentration of each dNTP, 40 pmol of each primer, 1.5 mmof Mg(OAc)2, 1 μg of DNA template and 4 units of enzyme. A “hotstart” protocol with AmpliwaxTM was used to increase the specificity of the reaction, which was cycled in order for 1 min at 94 °C, 16 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 13 min at 64 °C, 12 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 13 min at 64 °C with a cycle extension of 15 s/cycle, and 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were phenol-extracted, cut with HindIII, and separated on a low melting agarose gel. The 7.4-kb fragment was recovered and purified. The 7.4-kb fragment was then ligated to pGEM-7Zf vector and used to transform SURE-competent cells. Plasmid DNA was purified with a QIAGEN Plasmid Maxi kit; an extra ethanol precipitation step was used to reduce the salt concentration for DNA sequencing. Subcloned fragments were either sequenced manually using a Taq Cycle Sequencing kit (Amersham) or were sequenced on an ABI PRISM 377 sequencer with the ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit at the University of Virginia Sequencing Center. Sequence data were further complemented and confirmed at the Human Genome Center at University of Oklahoma. At the University of Oklahoma, cosmid DNAs were isolated free from E. coli host contamination by the cleared lysate, diatomacious earth-based procedure describe earlier (17Pan H.Q. Wang Y.P.

Chissoe S. Wang Y.F. Roe B.A. Adams M.D. Fields C. Venter J.C. Automated DNA Sequencing and Analysis Techniques. Academic Press, London1994: 42-50Google Scholar) using the ABI PRISM fluorescence-labeled terminators and either forward or reverse universal primers. Sequencing vector regions were removed, and the resulting data were assembled into contiguous fragments initially using the TED and XGAP programs (19Dear S. Staden R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3907-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and more recently using the Phred, Phrap, and Consed programs. 2B. Ewing, D. Gordon, and P. Green, World Wide Web URL http://www.genome.washington.edu/UWGC/ and personal communication. The individual contigs were joined into a final, unique sequence using custom, synthetic primers and Taq DNA polymerase cycle sequencing with fluorescent terminators. Each base was sequenced at least three times. Repeated sequence elements were identified using the RepeatMasker2 program. 3A. F. A. Smit and P. Green, Internet URL http://ftp.genome.washington.edu/RM/RepeatMasker.html and personal communication. In an earlier paper (14Pearson W.R. Vorachek W.R. Xu S. Berger R. Hart I. Vannais D. Patterson D. Am. J. Human Genet. 1993; 53: 220-233PubMed Google Scholar), we reported the identification of three yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones that contain human class Mu GST genes. Locus-specific PCR primers were used to show that GSTM-YAC1 contains GSTM1, GSTM3, and GSTM5; GSTM-YAC2 contains all five members of the class Mu family; and GSTM-YAC3 contains GSTM2 and GSTM4. The observation that all five class Mu GST genes are contained within the GSTM-YAC2 clone indicated that all five human class Mu GST genes are located on a single chromosome within the 600-kb insert. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was used to map GSTM-YAC2, and thus the human class Mu GST gene cluster, to chromosome 1p13.3 (14Pearson W.R. Vorachek W.R. Xu S. Berger R. Hart I. Vannais D. Patterson D. Am. J. Human Genet. 1993; 53: 220-233PubMed Google Scholar). As a first step toward mapping the end points of the GSTM1deletion in humans, we compared the organization of the class Mu glutathione S-transferase genes in GSTM-YAC1, -YAC2, and -YAC3 to their organization in human genomic DNA. Because two of the three YAC clones (GSTM-YAC1 and GSTM-YAC3) contain only a portion of the GSTM2 gene cluster, they can be used to determine the order and orientation of the genes. We first compared the sizes ofHindIII and EcoRI restriction fragments containing class Mu glutathione S-transferase genes that cross-hybridized with the GSTM1 cDNA clone GTH411 (22Pearson W.R. Reinhart J. Sisk S.C. Anderson K.S. Adler P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13324-13332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in GSTM-YAC1, -YAC2, and -YAC3 to restriction fragments in human DNAs. Fig. 1 A shows the pattern of hybridization seen with HindIII digests of the YAC and human DNAs; genomic DNA from two individuals, one carrying a non-nullGSTM1 allele and one homozygous for the GSTM1-0 deletion are shown. The GTH411 cDNA probe cross-hybridizes toGSTM4, GSTM2, GSTM5, as well asGSTM1, but GTH411 does not cross-hybridize efficiently toGSTM3 under the conditions used (data not shown). The pattern of hybridization in the GSTM-YAC2 lane is identical to the pattern in the GSTM1+/− individual, with the exception of a 1.5-kb HindIII band that has been assigned to chromosome 3 (14Pearson W.R. Vorachek W.R. Xu S. Berger R. Hart I. Vannais D. Patterson D. Am. J. Human Genet. 1993; 53: 220-233PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization to the GSTM1−/− sample differs at three locations; the 11.4-kb (this band was reported as 12.5 kb in earlier publications (14Pearson W.R. Vorachek W.R. Xu S. Berger R. Hart I. Vannais D. Patterson D. Am. J. Human Genet. 1993; 53: 220-233PubMed Google Scholar, 23Xu, S., Pearson, W. R., Proceedings of the International ISSX-Workshop on Glutathione S-Transferases, Vermeulen, N. P. E., Mulder, G. J., Nieuwenhuyse, H., Peters, W. H. M., van Bladeren, P. J., 1996, 227, 238, Taylor and Francis, Basingstoke, UK.Google Scholar), but our current map and sequence data have refined the size to 11.4 kb) and 2.2-kb bands associated withGSTM1 are absent in this sample, and an additional 7.6-kb band is present. This latter band is the result of a HindIII restriction fragment length polymorphism at the 5′-end of theGSTM5 gene (14Pearson W.R. Vorachek W.R. Xu S. Berger R. Hart I. Vannais D. Patterson D. Am. J. Human Genet. 1993; 53: 220-233PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to GSTM-YAC2, which contains all five class Mu glutathioneS-transferase genes, both GSTM-YAC1 and GSTM-YAC3 contain restriction fragments that are not found in human genomic DNA. Hybridization with pBR322, which cross-hybridizes with the YAC vector sequence (Fig. 1 B), shows that the novel 9.2-kbHindIII band in GSTM-YAC1 and the novel 4.9-kbHindIII band in GSTM-YAC3, which are not present in GSTM-YAC2 or human genomic DNA, contain both human (Fig. 1 A) and YAC vector DNA (Fig. 1 B). Thus, those two bands reflect a truncation of the human genomic HindIII fragment at the insert-vector junction. The absence of other abnormal bands demonstrates that the organization of the class Mu GST gene cluster was unaltered during the YAC cloning process. This was confirmed by probing an EcoRI digestion of YAC and human DNA samples. The YAC library from which our three clones were isolated was constructed from a partial EcoRI digestion and ligated into the EcoRI site of the pYAC4 vector; no novel bands are expected. All of the EcoRI bands in the three class Mu YAC clones match human genomic DNA EcoRI fragments from the individual with the GSTM1+/− genotype (Fig. 1 C). The absence of the 7.4-kb EcoRI band (this band was referred to as 8 kb in Refs. 14Pearson W.R. Vorachek W.R. Xu S. Berger R. Hart I. Vannais D. Patterson D. Am. J. Human Genet. 1993; 53: 220-233PubMed Google Scholar and 24Seidegard J. Vorachek W.R. Pero R.W. Pearson W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7293-7297Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar) in the DNA from an individual with the GSTM1−/− genotype results from theGSTM1 deletion. The extra 15-kb EcoRI band shown only in human genomic DNA may be from the class Mu GST sequence on chromosome 3. To determine the general organization of the gene cluster, we exploited the observation that both GSTM-YAC1 and GSTM-YAC3 have a class Mu GST gene flanked immediately by a pYAC4 sequence as indicated by the aberrant 9.2-kb (GSTM-YAC1) and 4.9-kb (GSTM-YAC3) HindIII fragments. Since GSTM-YAC1 lacks the GSTM2 and GSTM4 genes (14Pearson W.R. Vorachek W.R. Xu S. Berger R. Hart I. Vannais D. Patterson D. Am. J. Human Genet. 1993; 53: 220-233PubMed Google Scholar), and the GTH411 probe used in Fig. 1 does not cross-hybridize with GSTM3, the 9.2-, 6.5-, and 2.2-kbHindIII fragments in GSTM-YAC1 must be derived fromGSTM1 and GSTM5. The 2.2-kb HindIII band in Fig. 1 A contains a portion of the GSTM1gene as mentioned above; the 6.5-kb band is from the GSTM5gene (14Pearson W.R. Vorachek W.R. Xu S. Berger R. Hart I. Vannais D. Patterson D. Am. J. Human Genet. 1993; 53: 220-233PubMed Google Scholar). The 9.2-kb band is thus derived from the 11.4-kbHindIII band that also contains GSTM1. The truncation of GSTM1 in GSTM-YAC1 by the pYAC4 vector implies that GSTM1 is at one end of GSTM-YAC1 insert, and thus it must be situated in the middle of the entire class Mu GST gene cluster, separating GSTM3 and GSTM5 from GSTM2 and GSTM4. Moreover, the 11.4-kb HindIII band is derived from the 5′-end of GSTM1 (Fig. 2 B). Thus, GSTM1 is oriented with its 5′-end toward GSTM2 and GSTM4. By comparing the restriction enzyme digestion pattern in GSTM-YAC3 with that of GSTM-YAC2, we inferred the order of GSTM4 and GSTM2 with respect to the remaining members of the cluster. The GSTM4 gene contains a rare cut SmaI site in intron 2 (25Comstock K.E. Johnson K.J. Rifenbery D. Henner W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16958-16965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To estimate the distance between GSTM4 and GSTM2, YAC DNAs were digested with SmaI and hybridized with GTH411 probe (data not shown). Only a strong 18-kb band and a very faint 1.5-kb band appeared in GSTM-YAC3 DNA, suggesting that the majority of both GSTM4 and GSTM2 are contained in a 18-kb DNA segment. The cDNA sequence ofGSTM2 (26Vorachek W.R. Pearson W.R. Rule G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4443-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) contains a rare cut NruI site, as does the published portion of its genomic sequence (27Taylor J.B. Oliver J. Sherrington R. Pemble S.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). GSTM-YAC3 contains an 8.0-kb NruI fragment rather than the full-length 10.5-kb fragment found in GSTM-YAC2 (data not shown). Hybridization with probe for the pYAC4 vector showed that the aberrant 8.0-kb band is due to the truncation of the original 10.5-kb band by the vector-insert junction. Since GSTM4 and GSTM2 are about 18 kb apart, theNruI digestion result suggested that the GSTM2 is located next to the vector-insert junction in GSTM-YAC3, since the opposite order would result in a normal GSTM2-containingNruI band. The 5.0-kb abnormal GSTM2-containingHindIII fragment in GSTM-YAC3 was subsequently shown to hybridize only with the 3′-half of the GTH411-cDNA probe (Fig. 2 C). Together, the data suggest that GSTM2 is adjacent to GSTM1, since it is truncated at the insert-vector junction; furthermore, the observation that the aberrant 4.9-kb HindIII band contains only the 3′-portion ofGSTM2 indicates that GSTM2 is oriented with its 3′-end toward the insert-vector junction. Thus, GSTM2 is oriented with its 3′-end toward GSTM1. This interpretation was confirmed by sequencing a PCR-generated junction fragment spanning from the 3′-end of GSTM2 to the pYAC4 vector sequence in GSTM-YAC3 (data not shown). These data show that the orientation of the gene cluster in GSTM-YAC2 isGSTM4–5′-GSTM2-3′–5′-GSTM1-3′–GSTM5. To limit our search for the region deleted in the GSTM1-0 allele, we assigned each HindIII band in Fig. 1 to a specific GSTM gene. Three strategies were used in the assignment: 1) comparison of GSTM-YAC1 and GSTM-YAC3 (above); 2) polymorphisms in the GSTM1 and GSTM5 genes; and 3) 5′- and 3′-specific hybridization probes to determine the orientation the class Mu genes (Fig. 2). Hybridization patterns of the HindIII and EcoRI digestions of human genomic DNA with a GSTM1 cDNA probe show polymorphisms in only two of the four class Mu genes that hybridize with this probe. The GSTM1 deletion removes 11.4- and 2.2-kb HindIII fragments and a 7.4-kb EcoRI fragment. In addition, a HindIII restriction fragment length polymorphism is found near GSTM5 (14Pearson W.R. Vorachek W.R. Xu S. Berger R. Hart I. Vannais D. Patterson D. Am. J. Human Genet. 1993; 53: 220-233PubMed Google Scholar). To assign each fragment in the HindIII digestion, the 5′-half and 3′-half of the GSTM1-cDNA probe were used to probeHindIII digests of GSTM-YAC1–3 (Fig. 2). The 5′- and 3′-subclones divide GTH411 at a BglI site at residue 593 of the 1117-nucleotide insert, which is 10 nucleotides into exon 8 of theGSTM1 gene. Of the six HindIII bands that hybridize with the complete GTH411 probe, H2 (11.4 kb) and H6 (2.2 kb) can be assigned toGSTM1 based on polymorphism, and H3 (6.5 kb) can be assigned to GSTM5 because it is present in GSTM-YAC1 and -YAC2 but not in GSTM-YAC3. Assignment of GSTM2 and GSTM4is more complex, but H5 (5.2 kb in GSTM-YAC2, 4.9 kb in GSTM-YAC3) can be assigned to GSTM2 because GSTM2 is nearest to the GSTM-YAC3 vector junction. H1 (13.6 kb) can be assigned toGSTM4 and GSTM2 (see below); by process of elimination, H4 (5.3 kb) is assigned to GSTM5. The complete assignment of each band shows that there are no other unidentified class Mu GST genes in the GSTM-YAC2 that share enough sequence similarity with GSTM1 to be detected by the GTH411 probe. Hybridizations with separate 5′- and 3′-portions of GSTM1confirm that the 11.4-kb H2 fragment contains the 5′-end ofGSTM1, while the 2.2-kb H6 fragment contains the 3′-end ofGSTM1. Since the 13.6-kb H1 fragment hybridizes with both parts of GSTM1 and the 3′-end of GSTM2 is found on H5, H1 must contain both the 3′-end of GSTM4 gene and 5′-end of the GSTM2 gene (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that the 3′-end of GSTM4 is oriented towardGSTM2.

https://openalex.org/W1976086374,"The prohormone convertases PC2 (SPC2) and PC3/PC1 (SPC3) are the major precursor processing endoproteases in a wide variety of neural and endocrine tissues. Both enzymes are normally expressed in the islet beta cells and participate in proinsulin processing. Recently we generated mice lacking active PC2 due to a disruption of the PC2 gene (Furuta, M., Yano, H., Zhou, A., Rouillé, Y., Holst, J. J., Carroll, R. J., Ravazzola, M., Orci, L., Furuta, H., and Steiner, D. F. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 6646–6651). Here we report that these PC2 mutant mice have elevated circulating proinsulin, comprising 60% of immunoreactive insulin-like components. Acid ethanol extractable proinsulin from pancreas is also significantly elevated, representing about 35% of total immunoreactive insulin-like components. These increased amounts of proinsulin are mainly stored in secretory granules, giving rise to an altered appearance on electron microscopy. In pulse-chase experiments, the mutant islets incorporate lesser amounts of isotopic amino acids into insulin-related components than normal islets. In both wild-type and mutant islets, proinsulin I was processed more rapidly to insulin, reflecting the preference of both PC2 and PC3 for substrates having a basic amino acid positioned four residues upstream of the cleavage site. The overall half-time for the conversion of proinsulin to insulin is increased approximately 3-fold in the mutant islets and is associated with a 4–5-fold greater elevation of des-31,32 proinsulin, an intermediate that is formed by the preferential cleavage of proinsulin at the B chain-C-peptide junction by PC3 and is C-terminally processed to remove Arg31 and Arg32 by carboxypeptidase E. The constitutive release of newly synthesized proinsulin from both mutant and wild-type islets during the first 1–2 h of chase was normal (<2% of total). These results demonstrate that PC2 plays an essential role in proinsulin processing in vivo, but is quantitatively less important in this regard than PC3, and that its absence does not influence the efficient sorting of proinsulin into the regulated secretory pathway.

The efficient production of insulin in the pancreatic beta cell requires that it be processed as completely as possible from its precursor form, proinsulin, into fully active hormone before it is stored and secreted. Conversion of proinsulin to insulin involves cleavages at both junctions of the connecting segment that links the B and A chains in the prohormone to liberate insulin and C-peptide (1Steiner D.F. Bell G.I. Tager H.S. DeGroot L. Endocrinology. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1995: 1296-1328Google Scholar).

Initial cleavage occurs within these sites between residues 32 and 33 and residues 65 and 66, respectively, and the resulting C-terminal basic residue pairs Arg31-Arg32 and Lys64-Arg65 are then removed by the action of carboxypeptidase E to complete the formation of the native beta cell products. In the islet beta cells, both PC2 and PC3 are present in the secretory granules, and these two enzymes are believed to cooperate in processing proinsulin (3Neerman-Arbez M. Cirulli V. Halban P.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4Smeekens S.P. Montag A.G. Thomas G. Albiges-Rizo C. Carroll R.J. Benig M. Phillips L.A. Martin S.K. Ohagi S. Gardner P.

Chan S.J. Steiner D.F. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 16: 322-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Earlier studies from this laboratory showed that PC3 cleaves preferentially at the B-C junction, while PC2 prefers the C-A junction (4Smeekens S.P. Montag A.G. Thomas G. Albiges-Rizo C. Carroll R.J. Benig M. Phillips L.A. Martin S.K. Ohagi S. Gardner P. Swift H.H. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8822-8826Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). This was in keeping with the assignment of these two convertases as the Type 1 and Type 2 calcium-dependent proinsulin processing activities, respectively, as described by Davidson, et al. (6Davidson H.W. Rhodes C.J. Hutton J.C. Nature. 1988; 333: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that either enzyme is capable of cleaving proinsulin at both junctions to bring about its complete conversion to insulin (7Kaufman J.E. Irminger J.C. Mungall J. Halban P.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 978-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 2Q-M. Gong, Y. Rouillé, and D.F. Steiner, unpublished results. In addition, Rhodes, et al. (8Rhodes C.J. Lincoln B. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22719-22727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that PC3 might first act at the B-C junction to produce the intermediate des-31,32 proinsulin, which they showed was a preferential substrate for PC2 (having an approximate 5-fold faster cleavage rate than intact proinsulin). According to their scheme, lack of PC2 should lead to the generation of very large amounts of the partially cleaved intermediate, des-31,32 proinsulin, which could accumulate from the action of PC3. Since des-31,32 proinsulin is the major intermediate form found along with proinsulin in the circulation normally and is increased in the serum of many patients with type II diabetes (non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus), it has been suggested that this indicates a relative lack of PC2 action (9Rhodes C.J. Alarcón C. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 511-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We recently generated a PC2 null strain of mice that lack active PC2 altogether (10Furuta M. Yano H. Zhou A. Rouillé Y. Holst J.J. Carroll R.J. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Furuta H. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6646-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the effect of this mutation on the biosynthesis and processing of proinsulin in islets from the mutant mice. The PC2 null mutant mouse line was generated as described previously (10Furuta M. Yano H. Zhou A. Rouillé Y. Holst J.J. Carroll R.J. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Furuta H. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6646-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). For all experiments, 8–12-week-old mutant mice (PC2−/−) and control litter mates (PC2+/+) of the same age were used. The care of all animals used in these studies was in accordance with the National Institutes of Health and University of Chicago institutional guidelines. Islets of Langerhans were isolated as described (11Lernmark Å. Nathans A. Steiner D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 606-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Isolated islets were cultured overnight in RPMI medium containing 11 mm glucose and 10% fetal calf serum. After overnight culture, islets were labeled in groups of 300–400 in 100 μl of pulse medium (12Michael J. Carroll R. Swift H. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16531-16535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing 27.7 mm glucose, 3 μg/ml glucagon and 500 μCi (1 μCi = 37 GBq) each of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol), [3H]leucine (300 μCi/mmol) (Amersham Corp.). After 30 min of preincubation at 10–15 °C, islet incubations were continued at 37 °C in a water bath for 1 h (pulse). Islets were then washed, divided into four batches and incubated for 1, 2, and 3 h in medium containing 5 mm glucose and 20 μg/ml of unlabeled methionine and leucine. After the pulse and chase incubations, the islets were washed, resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 2.5 mg/ml BSA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.6) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors, and sonicated. The supernatants, after centrifugation for 2 min at 12,000 ×g, were then treated with an immunoaffinity absorbent consisting of guinea pig anti-insulin Ig fraction coupled to Bio-Rad Affi-Gel 10 agarose beads (Bio-Rad) (13Ostrega D. Polonsky K. Nagi D. Yudkin J. Cox L.J. Clark P.M.S. Hales C.N. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 437-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Insulin and proinsulin-related immunoreactive proteins were eluted from the beads with 30% acetonitrile, 1 m acetic acid. HPLC was carried out by a modification of the method of Davidson, et al. (6Davidson H.W. Rhodes C.J. Hutton J.C. Nature. 1988; 333: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 14Sizonenko S.V. Halban P.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) on a Waters System using a Lichrosphere 100 RP18 column, 4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm particle size with prefilter (Altech). Buffers were 0.05 mphosphoric acid, 0.10 m sodium perchlorate, 0.01m heptanesulfonic acid in water (A) and 90% acetonitrile in water (B). Elution was begun with 42.2% buffer B isocratic for 25 min, followed by a linear gradient increasing buffer B from 42.2 to 48.8% over 112.5 min (total time = 137.5 min). (In some experiments the gradient was ended after 75 min; total time = 100 min.) Samples were dissolved in 100 μl of 50% acetic acid and filtered through 0.45 μm Ultrafree-MC filter units (Millipore Corp.). Pancreatic extracts were prepared as described previously (15Tager H.S. Rubenstein A.H. Steiner D.F. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, New York1975Google Scholar). Blood was taken from the retro-orbital sinus. One ml of serum was pooled and stored at −80 °C until analyzed. Serum was applied to Sep-pak® C18 cartridge (Millipore Corp.), and extracted protein containing proinsulin and insulin-like products (16Wroblewski V.J. Masnyk M. Kaiser R.E. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1407-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) were lyophilized, dissolved in 3 m acetic acid and applied to a 1 × 50 cm Bio-Gel P-30 column eluted with 3 macetic acid containing 50 μg/ml of BSA. Fractions containing proinsulin or insulin were combined, dried, and resolved with immunoprecipitate buffer following radioimmunoassay. Mice were fixed by vascular perfusion with 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Samples of pancreatic tissue were processed for the conventional electron microscopy by postfixation with OsO4, dehydration with alcohol, and embedding in Epon. For light microscopic immunofluorescence, fragments of tissue were prepared as above but by omitting the postfixation step. Semi-thin (1 μm thick) sections were treated for Epon removal (17Maxwell M.H. J. Microsc. (Oxford). 1978; 112: 253-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with mouse monoclonal antiproinsulin antibodies (18Madsen O.D. Cohen R.M. Fitch F.W. Rubenstein A.H. Steiner D.F. Endocrinology. 1983; 113: 2135-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Madsen O. Vassalli J-D. Perrelet A. Cell. 1985; 42: 671-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) diluted at 0.1 μg/ml and then for 1 h with goat antimouse IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate. For electron microscopic immunocytochemistry, islets of Langerhans were dissected from glutaraldehyde-fixed pancreatic tissue, infused with 2.3 msucrose, and processed for cryo-ultramicrotomy (20Tokuyasu K.T. J. Microsc. (Oxford). 1986; 143: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Frozen thin sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with antiproinsulin antibodies followed by 30 min of exposure to goat antimouse IgG conjugated with 10-nm gold particles. Sections were stained with 2% uranyl acetate oxalate, pH 7, for 10 min followed by 2% methylcellulose containing 0.5% uranyl acetate for 30 min. Islets isolated from CD3 mice were cultured for 18 h in RPMI medium (11.1 mm glucose) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and then were pulse-labeled for 30 min at 37 °C in medium containing 27.7 mm glucose and 300 μCi/ml each of3H-leucine and [35S]methionine (12Michael J. Carroll R. Swift H. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16531-16535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The islets were extracted with acid-ethanol (16Wroblewski V.J. Masnyk M. Kaiser R.E. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1407-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and the extracted proteins were then separated by gel filtration over a 1 × 50 cm column of Bio-Gel P30 eluted with 3 m acetic acid containing 50 μg/ml BSA. The proinsulin-containing fractions, identified by counting of aliquots, were then pooled, dried, and redissolved in 0.01 m HCl. In vitro conversion of aliquots of this labeled mouse proinsulin was carried out using purified recombinant PC2 and PC3 (kindly supplied by Dr. Iris Lindberg, Louisiana State University Medical Center, New Orleans, LA). Reactions were carried out in 0.01m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 μm dithiothreitol, 5.0 mm CaCl2(reaction buffer). Five μl of recombinant PC2 or PC3 (0.23 μg) was incubated in 80 μl of reaction buffer at 37 °C for 1 h. An aliquot of labeled mouse proinsulin (∼80,000 dpm) was then added and incubation continued for 3 h. The reaction mixtures were neutralized by addition of 10 μl of 1 m Tris buffer, pH 8.4, an aliquot (1.4 μg) of carboxypeptidase B (CPB) (Boehringer Mannheim) was then added, and the tubes were incubated for an additional 5 min at 37 °C. The reactions were then stopped by acidification with glacial acetic acid to pH ∼2.0, and the samples were analyzed by HPLC as described above. The results are shown in Fig. 1. In this system, mouse proinsulin II (mP II), which contains both 35S and 3H, elutes earlier than mouse proinsulin I (m PI) (Fig. 1 A). Fig. 1, B and C, show the effects of recombinant PC2/CPB. A PC2 prep having very low activity (panel B) produced only a small amount of des-64,65 mP I (migrating between mP I and mP II), but not of mP II, indicating the more rapid attack of PC2 on the A-C junction in mP I, very likely due to the presence of the arginine at the P4 position (fourth residue upstream from cleavage site). Panel C shows the results using a more active preparation of PC2; des-64,65 intermediates of both mP I and II are now evident, but no significant amounts of any other intermediates are detectable. However, significant amounts of both insulins I and II have been produced, but relatively more of insulin I, indicating again that mP I is more rapidly processed by PC2 at both junctions (both junctions have P4 basic residues in mP I). Panel D shows the effect of PC3/CPB. No significant production of des-64,65 intermediates or of insulin is evident, but the expected des-31,32 mP intermediates can be readily identified, and here again, there is more rapid processing of mP I at the B-C junction by PC3. These results thus establish the relative elution positions of all the important mouse proinsulin I and II conversion intermediates and insulins in this HPLC system. Initial light microscopic studies of the islets of the PC2 null mice revealed marked hyperplasia of the alpha and delta cells and some diminution in beta cell mass, as was also indicated by the reduced pancreatic content of insulin to approximately 40% of normal values (10Furuta M. Yano H. Zhou A. Rouillé Y. Holst J.J. Carroll R.J. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Furuta H. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6646-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The results of measurements of plasma proinsulin-related and insulin components in extracts of pancreas or in serum are summarized in Table I. The proportion of proinsulin was increased to 35% in pancreas, indicating a significant block in proinsulin maturation in the storage granule compartment. In serum, proinsulin values were elevated to 60% of total immunoreactivity, but this greater increase merely reflects the prolonged plasma half-life of proinsulin, as compared with insulin, in the circulation.Table IProinsulin/insulin ratio in pancreata and serum from PC2+/+and PC2−/− miceGenotypePancreasSerumPC2+/+0.060.15PC2−/−0.350.60 Open table in a new tab We then carried out a series of biosynthetic studies to characterize proinsulin and insulin-related proteins in the islets and to examine the kinetics of conversion of the two mouse proinsulins into their respective insulins. The two mouse proinsulins differ at five positions, three in the C-peptide and two in the insulin (21Wentworth B.M. Schaefer I.M. Villa-Komaroff L. Chirgwin J.M. J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 23: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Mouse proinsulin II contains a single methionine residue substituting for the more typical lysine at position 29 in the B chain domain, which allows it to be readily distinguished from mouse proinsulin I in dual labeling experiments using [35S]methionine and3H-leucine (see Fig. 3). Our initial studies confirmed the existence of a partial block in insulin maturation but also revealed a dramatic difference in the incorporation into proinsulin/insulin-related components in the islets of the mutant mice. The overall incorporation of both amino acid precursors on a per islet basis was reduced to 10% or less of the normal control islet values (data not shown), a much greater reduction than indicated by the pancreatic morphometry or the assessments of insulin content, as mentioned above. This very large decrease in incorporation persisted after overnight culture of islets in 11.1 mm glucose. One possible source for this discrepancy may be the very thick mantle of alpha and delta cells that surrounds the more centrally located beta cells (10Furuta M. Yano H. Zhou A. Rouillé Y. Holst J.J. Carroll R.J. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Furuta H. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6646-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and that may prevent substrate access. We could partially circumvent this problem by preincubating islets in the labeling buffer at low temperature (5–10 °C) for 30 min prior to beginning the 37 °C pulse to allow diffusion of labeled amino acids into the islet core. The results of a typical pulse-chase study are shown in Fig. 2, which shows HPLC profiles for immunopurified proinsulin/insulin components after a 1-h pulse (used to enhance incorporation) followed by a 3-h chase. Notably in the case of the wild-type islets, both proinsulins (components g and h) rapidly disappear and are replaced by the two insulins (components a and b). In contrast, the proinsulin peaks decrease more slowly in the case of the mutant islets, and the two insulins appear more slowly. These results, summarized in Figs. 3and 4, indicate that mouse proinsulin I is more rapidly processed to insulin than mouse proinsulin II in both the wild-type and mutant islets. In the wild-type islets, low levels of des-31,32 proinsulin intermediates are detectable, but no significant levels of des-64,65 intermediates. In mutant islets this pattern is similar, but the levels of both des-31,32 intermediates I and II are increased about 5-fold to levels comprising up to 25% of the total insulin-related proteins (Fig. 4). Interestingly, while both proinsulins are essentially completely processed to insulin in wild-type islets, conversion slows during the 3rd h of chase so that about 80% of mP I is converted while only slightly more than half of the mP II is converted to insulin. These values are in good agreement with the immunoassay data, which indicated about 35% stored proinsulin in mutant pancreas (Table I). Since most of this material is in secretory granules, it is evident that conversion of proinsulin essentially stops after 4–5 h of granule maturation. Secreted levels of labeled proinsulin/insulin after 1 h of chase incubation amounted to less than 2% of total islet proinsulin/insulin radioactivity in these experiments, indicating that there was no significant elevation of constitutive secretion from either wild-type or mutant islets.Figure 4Time course of accumulation of des-31,32 proinsulin intermediates in wild-type and mutant islets during a 3-h chase following a 1-h pulse. Note the much greater accumulation of this intermediate in the mutant (closed symbols)versus wild-type (open symbols) islets. Also note that the level of des-31,32 intermediate of proinsulin I (diamonds) rises and falls faster than that of proinsulin II. Data are compiled from Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The data from the foregoing experiments are plotted in Fig. 5. Assuming pseudo-first-order initial conversion rates (1Steiner D.F. Bell G.I. Tager H.S. DeGroot L. Endocrinology. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1995: 1296-1328Google Scholar), half-lives of 0.36, 0.7, 0.8, and 2.5 h can be assigned, respectively, to PC2+/+ mP I, PC2+/+ mP II, PC2-/- mP I, and PC2-/- mP II. These data show that the processing of mP I is approximately 1.9-fold faster than mP II in the PC2+/+islets, while in the PC2−/− islets, it is about 3.1-fold faster. However, the rate of proinsulin processing between wild-type and mutant islets is 2.2-fold slower for mP I and 3.5-fold slower for mP II. Since mP II makes up ∼70% of the total proinsulin in mice, the overall retardation attributable to the lack of PC2 is approximately 3-fold. The subcellular localization of these increased amounts of proinsulin was examined by light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. In contrast to normal beta cells where proinsulin is localized to the Golgi apparatus and maturing secretory granules, proinsulin immunostaining in the beta cells of the mutant mice extends to the majority of the secretory granules (Fig. 6 and 7). The secretory granules are abundant in these cells, but most of them have a pale, homogeneous appearance and lack the typical well defined central, dense crystalline core (Fig. 8). Elevated proinsulin/insulin ratios have been shown to inhibit the crystallization of insulin in vitro (22Steiner D.F. Nature. 1973; 243: 528-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The formation of the typical dense crystalline beta granule cores appears to be similarly inhibited by elevated granule proinsulin in vivo(for another example, see Ref. 23Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nichina P.M. Rouillé Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J. Paigen B.J. Leiter E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). All these findings are thus consistent with the incomplete state of processing of the secretory granule contents (19Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Madsen O. Vassalli J-D. Perrelet A. Cell. 1985; 42: 671-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), but do not indicate any alteration in the sorting of proinsulin into secretory granules in the beta cells of the mutant mice.Figure 7Immunocytochemical localization of proinsulin on frozen thin sections of pancreatic beta cells from normal (A) and mutant mice (B). In normal mice (A), proinsulin labeling shows the classic location over the Golgi complex and the maturing secretory granules (msg) associated with the Golgi apparatus.

Note abundant pale, immature-appearing secretory granules in the mutant cells. Bar = 1 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The data presented here show that despite the lack of active PC2 about two-thirds of the proinsulin is processed to insulin in the maturing secretory granules of the islet beta cells in the PC2−/− mice. While earlier studies had indicated that PC3 cleaves preferentially at the B chain-C-peptide junction to generate des-31,32 proinsulin intermediates, these data confirm that PC3 acting alone is capable of converting proinsulin completely to insulin by processing at both junctions (7Kaufman J.E. Irminger J.C. Mungall J. Halban P.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 978-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, these results also clearly demonstrate the preference of PC3 for the B chain-C-peptide junction in that the processing of both proinsulin I and II in the mutant islets is accompanied by significant elevations in des-31,32 proinsulin. In the absence of PC2, there is no detectable generation of des-64,65 intermediates, as would be anticipated (4Smeekens S.P. Montag A.G. Thomas G. Albiges-Rizo C. Carroll R.J. Benig M. Phillips L.A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 22719-22727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The level of PC3 in the mutant beta cells does not appear to be significantly altered (data not shown), and thus the results we have obtained reflect the normal roles of PC2 and PC3 in proinsulin processing in the beta cells. It is of interest to compare these results on the generation of intermediate forms with those reported recently by Sizonenko and Halban (14Sizonenko S.V. Halban P.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) in studies on proinsulin processing in rat islets of Langerhans. While both rats and mice have two homologous proinsulin genes, there are differences in sequence surrounding the processing sites that affect their susceptibility to the convertases. As indicated in Fig. 9, rat proinsulin I has P4 basic residues at both positions while rat proinsulin II, like mouse proinsulin II, lacks the P4 lysine residue at the B-C junction, having methionine at this position instead. On the other hand, rat proinsulin II retains an arginine at the P4 position at the C-A junction, while mouse proinsulin II lacks basic P4 residues at both cleavage sites. Interestingly, in their study, Sizonenko and Halban (14Sizonenko S.V. Halban P.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) also found a slower rate of conversion of rat proinsulin II, but this was accompanied by a marked rise in the level of des-64,65 proinsulin intermediates, in sharp contrast to our finding in normal mouse islets where the predominant intermediate generated from both proinsulins I and II was the des-31,32 form (Fig. 4). It is very likely that this difference between rat and mouse proinsulin II reflects the preference of PC2 for substrates with a P4 arginine for efficient cleavage of the A-C junction. The lack of any build up of mouse des-64,65 proinsulin I in the wild-type islets also indicates that PC3 prefers a P4 basic residue for cleavage at the B chain junction. The foregoing findings are supported by molecular modeling studies of the catalytic sites of both PC2 and PC3, which indicate that these enzymes, like furin, contain acidic residues surrounding the P4 subsite (2Lipkind G. Gong Q. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13277-13284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These would be expected to facilitate interactions with basic amino acid side chains, and hence these prohormone convertases recognize and cleave sequences having P4 basic residues more efficiently. The sequence data shown in Fig. 9 also indicate that human proinsulin is unique in having a P4 basic residue at the B chain junction (lysine) while it lacks a P4 arginine residue at the A chain junction (leucine). As a consequence, PC3 would be expected to efficiently cleave the B chain junction to generate des-31,32 intermediate which, in turn, is a better substrate for PC2 than intact human proinsulin (8Rhodes C.J. Lincoln B. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22719-22727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There would thus be little tendency to generate a des-64,65 intermediate. A recent study on the processing of proinsulin in human islets supports these predictions (24Sizonenko S. Irminger J-C Buhler L. Deng S. Morel P. Halban P.A. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, the composition of human plasma proinsulin-related components, which consist predominantly of des-31,32 intermediate and intact proinsulin, but with little or none of the des-64,65 intermediate, are in accord with these considerations (25Hales C.N. Byrne C.D. Petry C.J. Wareham N.J. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 320-335Google Scholar). The extent to which prior cleavage at the B chain junction to generate intermediates that are preferentially cleaved by PC2 plays a role in the normal sequence of events in proinsulin processing will be best assessed in future studies using mice lacking PC3, when these become available. However, a recent report in the medical literature (26O'Rahilly S.O. Gray H. Humpreys P.J. Krook A. Polonsky K.S. White A. Gibson S. Taylor K. Carr C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1386-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) of a patient who is a compound heterozygote for defects in the SPC3 gene (27Jackson R.S. Creemers J.W.M. Ohagi S. Raffin-Sanson M-L. Sanders L. Montague C.R. Hutton J.C. O'Rahilly S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar) has indicated that insulin was not detectable among the circulating plasma immunoreactive insulin-like components, the more prominent being the des-64,65 proinsulin intermediate and large amounts of intact proinsulin. These findings taken altogether are consistent with the likelihood that, in both rodents and man, PC3 plays a quantitatively more important role in proinsulin processing than PC2. Even the most severe defect in PC2 production or action in the beta cell would be expected to produce only a partial block in the processing of proinsulin, but such a defect could be associated with diabetes. However, thus far no significant association of the PC2 gene locus with diabetes has been found although several polymorphisms have been noted (28Yoshida H. Ohagi S. Sanke T. Furuta H. Furuta M. Nanjo K. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Mutations in the PC2 gene leading to lower PC2 expression or activity throughout the neuroendocrine system, on the other hand, would be less likely to be associated with diabetes in view of the much more drastic consequences of such mutations on the production of glucagon, a hormone which normally opposes the action of insulin. Thus in the PC2 null mice, blood sugar levels are low and there is no impairment of glucose tolerance despite the high proportion of circulating proinsulin-like materials (10Furuta M. Yano H. Zhou A. Rouillé Y. Holst J.J. Carroll R.J. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Furuta H. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6646-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar).

Liganded trimeric TNFR1, in turn, recruits TNF receptor-associated proteins (TRADD, FADD, TRAF2, and others) to its intracytoplasmic domain to generate intracellular signaling cascades via second messengers including ceramide, 1,2-diacylglycerol, and arachidonic acid metabolites (see Refs. 7Smith C.A.

Although inducible IL-8 gene expression has been investigated intensively, controversy still exists as to mechanism responsible for TNFα-inducible transcription in epithelial cells. In human gastric adenocarcinoma cells, TNFα activates IL-8 through a synergistic effect on two regions, one cis element located at nucleotides (nt) −126 to −120 that contains a putative AP-1 binding site, and a second element at nt −80 to −71 that contains a nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) binding site (19Yasumoto K. Okamoto S. Mukaida N. Murakami S. Mai M. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22506-22511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In human bronchial epithelium-derived HS-24 and BET-1a cell lines, an element encompassing nt −130 to −112 was shown to be essential for TNF-inducible IL-8 promoter activity (20Nakamura H. Yoshimura K. Jaffe H.A. Crystal R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19611-19617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, in HeLa epithelial cells, TNFα activates IL-8 through a mechanism involving cooperative binding of nuclear factor-IL6 (NF-IL6) and NF-κB to a cis element encompassing nt −97 to −69 (21Stein B. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7191-7198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,22Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 265: 21128-21133Google Scholar). Given the highly tissue-restricted pattern of NF-IL6 expression, the relevance of this latter study to alveolar epithelium is uncertain (23Descombes P. Chojkier M. Lichsteiner S. Falvey E. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 24Jamaluddin M. Garofalo R. Ogra P.L. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1554-1563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, these studies have solely relied on transient transfection assays, a technique that does not always faithfully reproduce phenomenon of inducible gene expression within chromatin contexts (25Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar); thus, whether these observations are relevant to endogenous IL-8 gene expression is problematic. Therefore, in this study, we examine the mechanism for TNFα-inducible gene transcription in human alveolar epithelial (A549) cells using the technique of ligation-mediated PCR (LMPCR) to record changes in binding to the endogenous IL-8 promoter. LMPCR in recombinant human TNFα (rhTNFα)-treated cells demonstrates inducible DMS protection of guanine (G) bases at −79 and −80 and a DNase I footprint over nt −60 to −99 of the endogenous IL-8 promoter, occurring simultaneously with the peak in its endogenous transcription (at 0.5–1 h). Surprisingly, although no stable TATA box binding could be observed in unstimulated cells, an additional extended footprint from nt −3 to −32, spanning the TATA box, was observed in rhTNFα-stimulated cells. Transient transfection assays of 5′-deleted and site mutations of IL-8 promoter/luciferase plasmids demonstrate nt −60 to −99 is a TNF-response element (TNFRE). Inducible TNFRE DNA binding activity is composed of the NF-κB subunits Rel A, NF-κB1, and c-Rel. These subunits undergo rapid increases in nuclear abundance after rhTNFα treatment via a mechanism involving IκBα proteolysis. Finally, the peptide aldehyde N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, an agent that blocks IκBα proteolysis and inducible NF-κB binding, completely blocks endogenous IL-8 expression. We conclude that the NF-κB transcription factor complex, Rel A, c-Rel and NF-κB1, activate endogenous IL-8 gene expression through a promoter recruitment mechanism. rhTNFα and N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Lysolecithin (d-l-α-lysophosphatidylcholine) DNase I and dimethyl sulfate (DMS) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Thermostable Vent polymerase was obtained from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). A549 human alveolar type II-like epithelial cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in minimal essential medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 10 mm glutamine, 100 IU penicillin/ml, and 100 μg streptomycin/ml. rhTNFα was added to growth medium at a final concentration of 20 ng/ml. For in vitro modification of DNA, medium containing 1:1200 (v/v) DMS (diluted immediately prior to addition to cell culture) for 1 min at 37 °C. Afterward, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and genomic DNA was extracted using ion-exchange chromatography (A.S.A.P. kit, Boehringer Mannheim) for piperidine cleavage using previously published protocols (26Mueller P.R. Salser S.J. Wold B. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 412-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 27Mueller P.R. Wold B. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1991; 2: 20-31Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Forin vivo treatment with DNase I, A549 cells in 100-mm dishes were first permeabilized for 1.5 min by 0.5 μg/ml lysolecithin in buffer A (150 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 35 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2). The permeabilized cells were washed in 4 ml of buffer A, and treated with DNase I either at 10 μg/ml or 50 μg/ml in solution B (buffer A with 80 mm NaCl substituted for KCl) for 2 min. The DNase I-treated cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and genomic DNA was isolated by ion exchange chromatography. hIL-8 gene-specific primers synthesized to amplify the noncoding strand using the downstream (d) primers were: d1, 5′-CACACAGTGAGAATGGTTCCT-3′; d2, 5′-CCGGTGGTTTCTTCCTGGCTC-3′; and d3, 5′-CCGGTGGTTTCTTCCTGGCTCTTGTCCTAGAAG-3′. Due to the presence of an adenine-thymine-rich tract upstream of nt −170, it was not possible to synthesize upstream primers with the appropriate annealing temperature for LMPCR (28Mukaida N. Shiroo M. Matsushima K. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1366-1371PubMed Google Scholar) to footprint the noncoding strand. Unidirectional “linker primers” were synthesized as described (29Garrity P.A. Wold B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). LMPCR was performed as reported, using the following modifications. For the composition of the first strand synthesis reaction, 2–4 μg of modified genomic DNA was extended with 0.3 pmol primer d1 in a 30-μl reaction volume with 2 units of Vent polymerase. Extension parameters were: denaturation, 5 min at 95 °C; annealing, 30 min at 60 °C; and extension, 10 min at 76 °C. After ligation of undirectional linkers, DNA was ethanol-precipitated and amplified using 10 pmol of primer d2, 10 pmol of linker primer, and 2 units of Vent polymerase in a total volume of 100 μl. PCR cycling parameters were: denaturation, 1 min at 95 °C; annealing, 2 min at 66 °C; and extension, 3 min at 76 °C for 18 cycles (with 5 s added to extension step with each successive cycle). Samples were iced immediately and labeled using 2.3 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP/T4 polynucleotide kinase end-labeled primer d3 by PCR (denaturation, 3.5 min at 95 °C; annealing, 2 min at 67 °C; extension, 10 min at 76 °C for 2 cycles). Radiolabeled DNA was ethanol- precipitated, resuspended in formamide loading dye, and fractionated on a 6% polyacrylamide, 8m urea sequencing gel. The gel was dried and exposed to Kodak XAR film using an intensifying screen at −70 °C. 5′ deletion constructs of the hIL-8 promoter were produced using the PCR with −1498/+44 hIL-8/Luc reporter plasmid (18Garofalo R. Sabry M. Jamaluddin M. Yu R.K. Casola A. Ogra P.L. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8773-8781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a template and a downstream oligonucleotide hybridizing +86 to +55 (30Brasier A.R. Ron D. Conn P.M. Methods in Neurosciences. 5th Ed. Academic Press, San Diego1991: 108-123Google Scholar) of the luciferase cDNA. The following upstream primers were used to produce 5′ deletions (5′ nt indicated by minus; underline indicates BamHI restriction site): −162 hIL-8: 5′-AACTTTGGATCCACTCCGTATTTGATAAGG-3′; −132 hIL-8: 5′-AACAAAGGATCCTGTGATGACTCAGGTTTG-3′; −99 hIL-8: 5′-TGAAGGGGATCCGCCATCAGTTGCAAATCG-3′; −54 hIL-8: 5′ CATAATGGATCCATGAGGGTGCATAAGTTC-3′. The PCR products were restricted with BamHI and HindIII, gel-purified, and subcloned into the poLUC reporter vector (31Brasier A.R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 9.6-10.3Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the NF-κB site in the context of −162/+44 hIL-8 was introduced using the technique of PCR “SOEING” (18Garofalo R. Sabry M. Jamaluddin M. Yu R.K. Casola A. Ogra P.L. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8773-8781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the mutagenic primers (mutations underlined): 5′-TTCATTATGTCAGATTAAATTAAACGATTT-3′ and 5′-TTGCAAATCGTTTAATTTAATCTGACAATA-3′. For the NF-IL6 binding site-mutation, the primers 5′- GCCATCAGCTACGAGTCGTGGAATTTCCTCTGA-3′ and 5′-GAAATTCCACGACTCGTAGCTGATGGCCCATCC-3′ were used. hIL-8/LUC plasmids were purified by ion exchange (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and sequenced to verify authenticity. Transient transfections were performed in logarithmically growing A549 cells using 8 μg of IL-8/LUC reporter and 1 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase internal control plasmid (per 60-mm dish) using DEAE-dextran (18Garofalo R. Sabry M. Jamaluddin M. Yu R.K. Casola A. Ogra P.L. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8773-8781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 32 h, cells were stimulated in presence or absence of 20 ng/ml rhTNFα for 6 h. Cytoplasmic lysates were prepared and independently assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity (18Garofalo R. Sabry M. Jamaluddin M. Yu R.K. Casola A. Ogra P.L. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8773-8781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Li J. Brasier A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 252-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity is presented as normalized to β-galactosidase activity to control for plate-to-plate variations in transfection efficiency. Total RNA was extracted from control or rhTNFα-treated A549 monolayers by the acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol chloroform method (Tri-Solv; Biotecx, Houston, TX) and RNA abundance quantitated spectrophotometrically. Twenty micrograms of RNA was then fractionated on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to nylon-reinforced nitrocellulose membrane (MSI, Westboro, MA). The gel was then hybridized using body-labeled cDNA probe generated by PCR either using IL-8 primers (sense, 5′-ATGACTTCCAAGCTGGCCGTGGCT-3′; antisense, 5′-TCTCAGCCCTCTTCAAAAACTTCTC-3′), producing a 302-base pair probe or actin primers (sense, 5′-ATCTGGCACCACACCTTCTACAAT-3′; antisense 5′-CGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCC-3′) using standard PCR conditions (18Garofalo R. Sabry M. Jamaluddin M. Yu R.K. Casola A. Ogra P.L. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8773-8781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blots hybridized at 1 × 106 cpm/ml probe and were washed and exposed to a phosphorimager screen as described (33Virca G.D. Northemann W. Shiels B.R. Widera G. Broome S. Biotechnology. 1990; 8: 370-371Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (NE) of A549 monolayers were prepared using our previously published protocol (18Garofalo R. Sabry M. Jamaluddin M. Yu R.K. Casola A.

Duplex oligonucleotides corresponding to −96 to −69 base pairs of hIL-8 promoter are listed below. TNFREWT:GATCCATCAGTTGCAAATCGTGGAATTTCCTCTAGTAGTCAACGTTTAGCACCTTAAAGGAGATCTAGTNFREΔκ:GATCCATCAGTTGCAAATCGTTT_AATTTAA_TCTAGTAGTCAACGTTTAGCAAATTAAATTAGATCTAG Underlines indicate purine-to-noncomplementary-pyrimidine substitutions from the wild-type sequence. EMSAs included 15 μg of total protein, 1 μg of poly(dA-dT), and 20,000 cpm α-32P-labeled double-stranded IL-8 probe. Competition and supershift assays were performed as described (18Garofalo R. Sabry M. Jamaluddin M. Yu R.K. Casola A. Ogra P.L. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8773-8781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microaffinity purification of TNFRE-binding proteins was performed using chemically synthesized TNFRE wild-type (WT) oligonucleotides containing 5′ biotin (Bt) on a flexible linker (Genosys, The Woodlands, TX). Twenty pmol of duplex Bt-TNFRE WT was incubated with 1 mg of control or rhTNFα-treated A549 NE in the presence of 20 μg of poly(dA-dT) in a 500-μl volume of a buffer containing 8% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.9) for 1 h at 4 °C. Proteins bound to Bt-TNFRE WT were captured by addition of 50 μl of a 50% (v/v) slurry of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) and washed three times in binding buffer. TNFRE-binding proteins were then eluted by SDS-PAGE loading buffer for Western immunoblot analysis. For competition, a 5-fold excess of nonbiotinylated oligonucleotide was included in the initial binding reaction. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described (24Jamaluddin M. Garofalo R. Ogra P.L. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1554-1563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Rel A, c-Rel, NF-κB1, and Rel B were obtained commercially (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and used as primary antibody according to the supplier's recommendations. Secondary detection was using horseradish peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-rabbit antibody in the ECL enhanced chemiluminescence assay (Amersham Life Sciences) as described (18Garofalo R. Sabry M. Jamaluddin M. Yu R.K. Casola A. Ogra P.L. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8773-8781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Jamaluddin M. Garofalo R. Ogra P.L. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1554-1563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear suspensions from 107 control or rhTNFα-treated A549 cells were used to incorporate [α-32P]UTP into nascent RNA at 30 °C for 45 min (18Garofalo R. Sabry M. Jamaluddin M. Yu R.K. Casola A. Ogra P.L. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8773-8781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After purification of RNA by sequential trichloroacetic acid and ethanol precipitation, a constant 5 × 106 cpm/ml from each treatment was used to hybridize immobilized single-stranded plasmid DNAs corresponding to hIL-8, β-actin, and cyclophilin cDNAs. Membranes were washed, and quantitated by exposure to a phosphorimager screen. Immunoreactive IL-8 was quantitated in cell culture supernatants by a double-antibody ELISA kit (R&D Systems) following the manufacturer's protocol. Human alveolar epithelial A549 cells were selected for study because they maintain features of type II pneumocytes through their morphological appearance, ability to secrete surfactant, and susceptibility to respiratory syncytial virus infection, all of which are features of human alveolar cells (2Standiford T.J. Kunkel S.L. Basha M.A. Chensue S.W. Lynch J.P. Toews G.B. Westwick J. Strieter R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1945-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 18Garofalo R. Sabry M.

Barnes P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L398-L405PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoreactive IL-8 was quantified by ELISA in A549 cell culture supernatants after stimulation with 20 ng/ml rhTNFα (Fig. 1 A). A statistically significant 3-fold increase in IL-8 production was detected after 2 h (as compared with control supernatants); immunoreactive IL-8 continued to accumulate to a 53-fold increase at 24 h. Northern blot assays were performed to determine changes in steady state IL-8 mRNA abundance at times preceding the changes in protein secretion (0–8 h; Fig. 1 B). In the absence of rhTNFα, IL-8 mRNA was barely detectable. However, accumulation of a single 1.8-kilobase IL-8 transcript was strongly induced by rhTNFα treatment, starting at 0.5 h and peaking at 2 h (a 110-fold increase). To determine the transcriptional component for induction of IL-8 mRNA, the kinetics of IL-8 gene transcription was measured by nuclear run-on assay for 0–4 h after rhTNFα treatment (Fig. 1 C). Slightly preceding the maximal changes in mRNA, IL-8 transcription rapidly peaked at 0.5–1 h (a 20-fold induction). Although IL-8 transcription declined thereafter, it still remained elevated compared with control levels at 2 h (7-fold) and 4 h (3-fold). The slight lag in mRNA accumulation is probably reflective of the time required for the longer-lived IL-8 mRNA levels to reach steady state within the cell. To determine whether rhTNFα changes the composition of proteins interacting with the IL-8 gene promoter, two variations of the LMPCR (27Mueller P.R. Wold B. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1991; 2: 20-31Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) technique were used using IL-8 gene-specific primers. First, intact cells were treated with the membrane-soluble alkylating agent DMS, an agent that methylates exposed guanine (G) bases in the DNA major groove. The location of G methylation can be determined following extraction and piperidine cleavage. Fig. 2 A shows the results of DMS/LMPCR by amplifying the DMS-modified coding strand from control or rhTNFα-treated cells (at times corresponding to the peak in IL-8 transcription). As controls, deproteinized genomic DNA was DMS-treated and amplified in parallel. Surprisingly, in unstimulated cells, no stable protein-DNA interaction could be detected by DMS/LMPCR (compare lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, rhTNFα treatment induces a rapid protection of G residues at nt −79 and −80 and the appearance of several hypersensitive sites, the most prominent at nt −-82 of the coding strand (asterisks and arrow, respectively, in Fig. 2 A). For additional information on genomic protein binding sites, LMPCR was used to assay IL-8 promoter occupancy after DNase I treatment in vivo. DNase I can be introduced into cultured cells after transient permeabilization of the cell membrane by lysolecithin without disruption of protein·DNA interaction (36Zhang L. Gralla J.D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1814-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 Bdemonstrates DNase I/LMPCR of deproteinized genomic DNA compared with control or rhTNFα-treated A549 cells. As compared with the DNase I digestion pattern of deproteinized DNA, in unstimulated cells, a protected region between nt −55 to −68 and a larger extended protection could be detected from nt −99 to ∼−147 (the upper border was indistinct) with a hypersensitive site at nt ∼−115. Importantly, no stable protein-DNA interaction was detected over the proximal promoter from nt −3 to −32 (a region containing the TATA box). By contrast, after 1 h of rhTNFα treatment, two inducible regions could be identified: 1) nt −3 to −32 (corresponding to the TATA box), and 2) nt −60 to −99 (containing the G residues inducibly protected using DMS/LMPCR assay). Also in the rhTNFα-treated ladder, the indistinct upstream border of the constitutive protected region became hypersensitive to DNase I cleavage, probably indicating a conformational change of the DNA. A summary of the DMS- and DNase I/LMPCR results is shown in Fig. 2 C. That TATA box binding is rhTNFα-inducible implies a promoter-recruitment model in IL-8 gene activation (see “Discussion”). Both techniques of DNA modification indicated inducible protein binding to region contained in nt −60 to −99, and a constitutive site containing the putative AP-1 site nt −120 to −126. To assay for which cis elements are important in inducible activity, transient transfections of 5′-deletions (Fig. 3 A) or site mutations of the IL-8 promoter linked to luciferase reporter genes (Fig. 3 B) were performed. −162/+44 hIL-8/LUC is 28 ± 5-fold inducible by 20 ng/ml rhTNFα treatment (X ± S.E., n = 8 independent transfections). Fig. 3 Ashows the results of a representative transfection where -fold inducibility of −162/+44, −132/+44, −99/+44 and −54/+44 hIL-8/LUC reporters are compared. -Fold induction of 5′ deletions to −99/+44 and longer promoters are indistinguishable, but deletion to −54 is significantly less rhTNFα-inducible, indicating the region nt −54 to −99, containing the rhTNFα-inducible LMPCR footprint, plays an indispensable role in promoter activity. Fig. 3 B shows the kinetics of luciferase reporter induction for the −162/+44 hIL-8/LUC wild-type (WT) plasmid in comparison to the same promoter containing a purine to noncomplementary pyrimidine mutation in the G residues −79, −80 and its mirror half-site on nt −72 and −73 on the noncoding strand (designated −162/+44 hIL-8Δκ/LUC). In the absence of rhTNFα, the −162/+44 hIL-8Δκ/LUC reporter was consistently less active than the WT reporter, at 25 ± 17% of the WT activity (n = 4). Moreover, −162/+44 hIL-8Δκ/LUC was inert to rhTNFα stimulation (F"

We previously found an inhibition of contraction and O2 consumption during hypoxia (3% O2; PO2 = 20 torr for >2 h) in cardiomyocytes, which was reversible after reoxygenation. This study sought to determine whether mitochondria function as cellular O2 sensors mediating this response. Embryonic cardiomyocytes were studied under controlled O2 conditions. Hypoxia produced no acute decrease in mitochondrial potential as assessed using tetramethylrhodamine ethylester (TMRE). Cellular [ATP] was preserved throughout hypoxia, as assessed using the probe Magnesium Green. Thus, ATP synthesis and utilization remained closely coupled. Cells adapted to hypoxia for >2 h exhibited a 4% increase in mitochondrial potential upon reoxygenation, suggesting that a partial inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase had existed. To test whether the oxidase serves as an O2sensor, azide was administered (1 mm) to simulate the effects of hypoxia by lowering the V max of the oxidase. The effects of azide on contraction and mitochondrial potential mimicked the response to hypoxia. We conclude that partial inhibition of cytochrome oxidase during hypoxia allows mitochondria to function as the O2 sensor mediating the decreases in ATP utilization and O2 consumption during hypoxia.

We conclude that partial inhibition of cytochrome oxidase during hypoxia allows mitochondria to function as the O2 sensor mediating the decreases in ATP utilization and O2 consumption during hypoxia. Regional decreases in myocardial oxygen delivery have been shown to result in decreased contractile activity and O2consumption in a phenomenon termed hibernating myocardium. For example, Arai et al. (1Arai A.E. Pantely G.A. Anselone C.G. Bristow J. Bristow J.D. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 1458-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) induced a 30% reduction in coronary blood flow in swine and observed an early depletion of ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr) 1The abbreviations used are: PCr, phosphocreatine; TMPD, N, N, N′, N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine; TMRE, tetramethylrhodamine ethylester; MgG, Magnesium Green; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone; BDM, 2,3-butanedione monoxime. 1The abbreviations used are: PCr, phosphocreatine; TMPD, N, N, N′, N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine; TMRE, tetramethylrhodamine ethylester; MgG, Magnesium Green; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone; BDM, 2,3-butanedione monoxime. and an increase in tissue lactate followed by a later recovery of PCr and lactate, despite continued hypoperfusion and impaired contraction. During progressive decreases in coronary blood flow, the same group found that regional decreases in contractile function occurred without a sustained decrease in the PCr to ATP ratio (2Arai A.E. Grauer S.E. Anselone C.G. Pantely G.A. Bristow J.D. Circulation. 1995; 92: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Other investigators have also found evidence of myocardial hibernation in intact hearts (3Lee S.-C. Downey H.F. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1542-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 4Ito B.R. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2058-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Marban E. Circulation. 1991; 83: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Collectively these results indicate that the myocardium can develop significant contractile inhibition during reductions in blood flow without apparent evidence of ischemia. This would appear to represent an adjustment in ATP demand in response to a decrease in regional O2 supply, which could protect the myocardium from ischemic injury in states where blood flow is reduced more severely (6Ross J.J. Circulation. 1991; 83: 1076-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying this response are not fully known (5Marban E. Circulation. 1991; 83: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The inference that intact myocardium can down-regulate energy requirements and ATP demand during hypoxia suggests that cardiac myocytes may behave similarly. In contracting embryonic cardiomyocytes, we previously observed decreases in contractile motion and in the rate of O2 uptake during prolonged moderate hypoxia (PO2 = 20–40 torr for 1–2 h) (7Budinger G.R.S. Chandel N. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Melmed A. Becker L.B. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L37-L53Google Scholar). Moreover, this inhibition was reversible within 3 h after return to normoxia, which suggests that cardiac myocytes can detect moderate hypoxia and initiate a suppression of ATP utilization in response. Recently, Silverman et al. (8Silverman H.S. Wei S. Haigney M.C.P. Ocampo C.J. Stern M.D. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) found decreases in extent of shortening in rat cardiac myocytes after incubation under 1% O2 for 48 h, which is consistent with our observations and reveals that this response is not unique to embryonic cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that cardiomyocytes can respond to moderate hypoxia by reversibly decreasing contractile activity, atPO2 levels that should have been sufficient to sustain mitochondrial respiration. Although hibernating myocardium is a phenomenon of intact hearts by definition, studies of cellular responses to hypoxia may provide insight into the mechanisms involved in the intact ventricle. A fundamental question in understanding the mechanism underlying the response to hypoxia relates to how cardiac myocytes detect changes inPO2. An ability to adjust cellular respiration in response to PO2 implies the existence of a sensor capable of detecting changes within the physiological range. It is conceivable that such an O2 sensor could then activate a signaling pathway leading to a down-regulation of contractile motion, energy utilization, and oxygen demand. Recent evidence points to the mitochondrial electron transport chain as a possible site of O2 transduction (9Chandel N. Budinger G.R.S. Kemp R.A. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L918-L925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, we previously found a reversible inhibition in cytochrome c oxidaseV max during hypoxia, as evidenced byPO2-dependent decreases in TMPD-ascorbate respiration (7Budinger G.R.S. Chandel N. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Melmed A. Becker L.B. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L37-L53Google Scholar). Moreover, kinetic studies of isolated bovine heart cytochrome oxidase confirmed the existence ofPO2-dependent alterations inV max (10Chandel N.S. Budinger G.R.S. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18672-18677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). APO2-dependent change in the kinetic activity of cytochrome oxidase could elicit changes in mitochondrial redox state, which could confer a sensitivity toPO2 and allow the mitochondria to act as the cellular O2 sensor. In the present study we assessed the effects of moderate hypoxia and reoxygenation on mitochondrial transmembrane potential to determine whether changes in the function of the oxidase were apparent in the intact myocyte, and whether under normoxic conditions the cytochrome c oxidase inhibitor sodium azide could mimic the reversible decrease in contraction observed during hypoxia. Myocytes were isolated using a method modified from Barry et al. (11Barry W.H. Pober J. Marsh J.D. Frankel S.R. Smith T.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 239: H651-H657PubMed Google Scholar) and previously described (7Budinger G.R.S. Chandel N. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Melmed A. Becker L.B. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L37-L53Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts of 10–11-day-old chick embryos were removed and placed in Hanks' balanced salt solution without magnesium and without calcium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The ventricles were minced, and the cells were dissociated using four to six cycles of trypsin (0.025%, Life Technologies, Inc.) degradation at 37 °C with gentle agitation. Trypsin digestion was halted after 8 min by transferring dissociated cells to a trypsin inhibitor solution. After filtering (100 μm), the cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 1200 rpm at 4 °C and then resuspended in nutritive media (54% Barry's solution (in mm: NaCl (116), KCl (1.3), NaHCO3(22Monteiro H.P. Stern A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), MgSO4 (0.8), NaH2PO4 (1.0), CaCl2 (0.87), glucose (5.6)), 40% M199 with Earle's salts (Life Technologies, Inc.), 6% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml)). These cells were then placed in a large Petri dish in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C) for 45 min to allow early adherence of fibroblasts. The nonadherent cells were then enumerated (hemacytometer), their viability confirmed at >85% (trypan blue) and between 0.6 and 1.5 × 106 cells were plated on glass coverslips (25 mm) in nutritive medium. Cell yield averaged 5–6 × 105 cells per embryo. Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator for 2–3 days, at which point synchronous contractions of the monolayer were noted. All experiments were performed on spontaneously contracting cells at day 3 or 4 after isolation, at which point cell viability was typically >99%. Synchronously contracting cardiac myocytes on 25-mm glass coverslips were placed in a stainless steel flow-through chamber (2-ml volume). This flow-through chamber was inserted into a heated platform (37 °C) (Warner Instruments) on an inverted microscope stage. A water-jacketed glass equilibration column (37 °C) mounted above the microscope stage was used to equilibrate the perfusate to known oxygen tensions. The perfusate used during experiments consisted of a buffered salt solution (in mm: NaCl (117), KCl (4.0), NaHCO3 (18Rumsey W.L. Schlosser C. Nuutinen E.M. Robiolio M. Wilson D.F. J. Biol.

The gas used to control thePO2 and PCO2 of the perfusate was supplied by a calibrated precision mass flow controller (Cameron Instruments). A short length of stainless steel or polyethylethylketone tubing was used to connect the equilibration column to the flow-through chamber to minimize the leakage of ambient O2 into the perfusate. In some studies, thePO2 in the chamber was confirmed using an optical phosphorescence quenching method (Oxyspot, Medical Systems Inc.) In those studies, a porphin-based dye (20 μm) bound to albumin (5% w/v) was added to the perfusate (12Wilson D.F. Rumsey W.L. Green T.J. Vanderkooi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2712-2718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lo L.W. Koch C.J. Wilson D.F. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and the fiberoptic light guide was positioned above the upper glass coverslip of the flow-through chamber. In those studies, thePO2 in the chamber was determined from the O2-dependent phosphorescence decay following a pulse of excitation light generated by a xenon flash lamp. The inverted microscope was equipped for epifluorescent illumination and included a xenon light source (75 W), a cooled 12-bit digital CCD camera (Princeton Instruments), a shutter and filter wheel (Sutter), and appropriate excitation and emission filters. Data were acquired and analyzed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging). Contractile motion of cells was recorded at video rates on magnetic tape using a high resolution video camera (Hammamatsu), as described previously (7Budinger G.R.S. Chandel N. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Melmed A. Becker L.B. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L37-L53Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were illuminated with visible light at low intensity using Hoffman modulation optics (Modulation Optics, Inc.). This optical system tended to accentuate the changes in surface topology that were apparent during contraction. Approximately 1 min of contractile motion was recorded at each stage for later analysis. Recorded sequential video frames were digitized and pixels were assigned an intensity value ranging from 0 to 255. For each pixel, the absolute change in intensity was summed over ∼250 frames. These summed changes in intensity were summed for all pixels, providing a single measure of motion in the field that consistently described the motion that already was evident by inspection. The contraction analysis was carried out as a series of macroinstructions using the Metamorph software (Universal Imaging). The mitochondrial transmembrane potential was measured using the cationic dye tetramethylrhodamine ethylester (TMRE, Molecular Probes). This fluorophore enters the cells and is accumulated in mitochondria according to the Nernst equation (14Ehrenberg B. Montana V. Wei M.-D. Wuskell J.P. Loew L.M. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 15Farkas D.L. Wei M.-D. Febbroiello P. Carson J.H. Loew L.M. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 1053-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and has been used previously to assess relative changes in mitochondrial potential. Unlike with rhodamine 123, we did not observe quenching of cellular fluorescence with TMRE unless excessive dye was loaded into the cells. Excitation (535 nm), dichroic (565 nm), and emission (610 nm) filters were used (Chroma Technology). To minimize photobleaching of the dye, the excitation intensity was attenuated with a neutral density filter, and exposure times were limited to 100 ms. Coverslips with spontaneously contracting cells were loaded for 1 h with TMRE (100 nm) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C. The cells were then placed in the flow-through chamber and continuously perfused with the buffered salt solution containing TMRE (10 nm). After allowing 60–90 min for equilibration, a digital image was obtained of a field of ∼40 cells using a 40× oil immersion objective lens. Using the data acquisition software, individual cells or clusters of several (<10) cells were identified as regions of interest, and background was identified as an area without cells or with minimal cellular fluorescence. Subsequently, sequential digital images were obtained every 1–3 min, and the average fluorescence intensity for all of the cell regions and background was recorded for later analysis. TMRE fluorescence intensity is reported as the average of the fluorescence of all identified cell regions, less background, for each coverslip. ATP has a greater affinity for Mg2+ than does ADP, and the cytosolic ionized magnesium concentration increases during ATP hydrolysis. The increases in cytosolic [Mg2+] can be assessed using the intracellular fluorescent indicator Magnesium Green (MgG), and the behavior of this dye in cardiomyocytes has been studied in detail by Leyssens et al. (16Leyssens A. Nowicky A.V. Patterson L. Crompton M. Duchen M.R. J. Physiol. 1996; 496: 111-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We measured MgG fluorescence (excitation 480 nm, emission 535 nm) in contracting cardiomyocytes during prolonged hypoxia and reoxygenation to assess ATP hydrolysis. Cells on coverslips were loaded with MgG in the acetoxymethyl ester form (5 μm, Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. Subsequently, the cells were transferred to the flow-through chamber and perfused with buffered salt solution under controlled O2 and CO2 conditions. To abolish the capacity for anaerobic glycolysis, 2-deoxyglucose (20 mm) was added to the perfusate, along with pyruvate (5 mm) to support mitochondrial respiration. Cells continued to contract spontaneously under these conditions. Fluorescent images were collected for multiple regions of interest every 60 s, using 100-ms exposure times. Average fluorescence was then calculated for each coverslip and analyzed as a percentage of initial values after subtraction of background fluorescence. At the end of the study, the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP was added (5 μm) to induce ATP hydrolysis to confirm activity of the probe. In different experiments the cells were treated with the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP, the electron transport inhibitor myxothiazol, the mitochondrial ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin and 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM) (Sigma). Using a spectrofluorometer, all of these compounds were found to exhibit insignificant fluorescence at 565 nm or quenching when excited at 530 nm (data not shown). Replicate experiments were carried out independently using separate coverslips with cells. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance on the pooled data from the intervention and control experiments. Statistical significance was determined at the 0.05 level. Data are presented as mean values ± S.E. The contractile response to moderate hypoxia and reoxygenation was studied in cultured cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1). After 2 h under normoxic conditions (PO2 = 100 torr), the perfusatePO2 was reduced to ∼20 torr (3% O2) for 3 h. No immediate effect on contraction was noted, but within 1–2 h a significant decrease in motion was consistently observed. When the perfusate O2 tension was returned to 100 torr, no immediate effect on contractile motion was noted. However, a progressive return of contraction developed over 2–3 h, and no significant difference from control levels was apparent at 3 h. These reversible decreases in contraction were similar to those noted previously (7Budinger G.R.S. Chandel N. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Melmed A. Becker L.B. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L37-L53Google Scholar). Previous studies of noncontracting cardiomyocytes in suspension indicated that prolonged moderate hypoxia was associated with a decrease in oxygen consumption rate without a decrease in cellular ATP or phosphocreatine concentrations (7Budinger G.R.S. Chandel N. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Melmed A. Becker L.B. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L37-L53Google Scholar). To determine whether ATP depletion occurs during prolonged hypoxia in contracting cells, MgG fluorescence was used to assess ATP hydrolysis (16Leyssens A. Nowicky A.V. Patterson L. Crompton M. Duchen M.R. J. Physiol. 1996; 496: 111-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To determine the capability of this dye to detect ATP hydrolysis, cells loaded with MgG were imaged every 60 s during continuous normoxia (Fig. 2). After 4 min, the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP was administered to limit ATP synthesis, and an abrupt increase in fluorescence was noted, consistent with a rise in intracellular Mg2+. In other cells loaded identically, the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin (10 μg/ml) produced a similar abrupt increase in fluorescence, as predicted (Fig. 3). To determine the effects of hypoxia on ATP hydrolysis, cells loaded with MgG were imaged every 5 min during 2.5 h of incubation at PO2 = 20 torr or 100 torr. As shown in Fig. 4, a gradual loss of fluorescence was noted in both groups, which appeared to be a consequence of the progressive photobleaching behavior of the MgG probe. However, no difference was noted between control and hypoxic cells. Moreover, the absence of an increase in fluorescence during hypoxia suggested that cytosolic [Mg2+] did not increase as a result of increased ATP hydrolysis. However, when ATP synthesis was halted by FCCP (5 μm) at the end of the study, a marked increase in fluorescence indicating an increase in [Mg2+] was noted.Figure 3Effects of mitochondrial ATP synthase inhibition on MgG fluorescence in spontaneously contracting cardiomyocytes. Cells loaded with MgG were perfused under normoxic conditions (PO2 = 100 torr; 14% O2) and administered oligomycin (10 μg/ml) to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. The marked increase in fluorescence suggests an increase in Mg2+ release as a result of ATP hydrolysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Effects of hypoxia on MgG fluorescence in spontaneously contracting cardiomyocytes. Under base-line conditions, cells loaded with MgG were perfused with normoxic (PO2 = 100 torr; 14% O2) solution. At t = 30 min, perfusate PO2 was reduced to 20 torr (3% O2) in the hypoxia group while controls remained normoxic. At t = 180 min, the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP (5 μm) was administered to elicit ATP hydrolysis. No statistical difference between groups was detected (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Studies were carried out to confirm that the fluorescent probe TMRE behaved in a manner consistent with that expected for a mitochondrial potentiometric dye. Administration of the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP would be expected to rapidly dissipate the mitochondrial electrochemical gradient. As predicted, addition of FCCP (5 μm) to the perfusate of contracting cardiac myocytes at t = 0 produced a rapid and marked decrease in fluorescence indicating a loss of potential (Fig. 5 a). Mitochondrial potential is generated by flux through the electron transport chain, which is coupled to the extrusion of protons from the matrix. Inhibitors of electron transport should decrease proton extrusion, resulting in a decrease in the potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Accordingly, the mitochondrial bc1 complex inhibitor myxothiazol (50 ng/ml) was added to the perfusate of contracting cardiac myocytes.(Fig. 5 b). This produced a significant decrease in TMRE fluorescence, consistent with a marked decrease in potential. Mitochondrial membrane potential is consumed by theF 1 F 0 ATP synthase. The synthase allows protons to move down their electrochemical gradient as they enter the matrix, resulting in the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP using the resulting free energy release. Inhibition of ATP synthase should therefore cause hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane. As shown in Fig. 6, addition of oligomycin (10 μg/ml) to the perfusate of contracting cardiac myocytes resulted in a significant increase in TMRE fluorescence. Similarly, an inhibition of ATP utilization should cause a decrease in the rate of ATP synthesis by limiting the supply of ADP to the mitochondria, which should produce hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial potential. To confirm this, BDM (30 mm) was added to the perfusate of contracting cardiac myocytes att = 0 (Fig. 7). As an inhibitor of Ca2+-dependent actin-myosin interaction, BDM produced an immediate and significant increase in TMRE fluorescence, which was accompanied by an immediate cessation of contraction. Collectively, these results show that TMRE serves as an appropriate qualitative measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential.Figure 7Effects of decreased ATP utilization on TMRE fluorescence in spontaneously contracting cardiomyocytes. BDM inhibits Ca2+-dependent actin-myosin interaction in cardiac muscle, resulting in a decrease in ADP supply to mitochondria. The subsequent decrease in ATP utilization should result in a hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane. BDM (30 mm) given at t = 0 s caused an immediate cessation of contractile motion, and elicited a sustained increase in fluorescence in the treated cells while fluorescence in the control cells remained unchanged (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed during hypoxia under two different experimental protocols. In the first, TMRE fluorescence in contracting cells was measured in images obtained as the perfusate O2 tension was decreased from 100 to 25 torr within 10 min (acute hypoxia). As shown in Fig. 8, acute hypoxia produced no acute change in TMRE fluorescence, which suggests that membrane potential was maintained. In the second, mitochondrial potential was recorded in contracting cells that had been perfused for 2 h atPO2 = 25 torr, as the PO2was rapidly increased from 25 to 100 torr (acute reoxygenation). Fig. 9 a shows that TMRE fluorescence increased significantly during reoxygenation, which suggests that an increase in membrane potential had occurred. This relative hyperpolarization is consistent with an increase the rate of electron transport during acute reoxygenation, compared with the rate of ATP utilization. Interestingly, the change in membrane potential did not occur until ∼4 min after the equilibration mixture was switched to normoxia. In separate studies, the PO2 within the cell chamber was assessed under identical conditions of reoxygenation using a phosphorescence-quenching method (12Wilson D.F. Rumsey W.L. Green T.J. Vanderkooi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2712-2718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Those measurements revealed that the PO2 within the chamber reached a value of ∼60 torr at 4 min, which suggested that the delay in response was caused by the slow response in reoxygenating the system (Fig. 9 b).Figure 9a, TMRE fluorescence in spontaneously contracting cardiomyocytes perfused continuously with hypoxic media (PO2 = 25 torr) for 90 min. Att = 0 s, the gas in the equilibration column was increased to PO2 = 100 torr (14% O2, reoxygenation) or maintained at 25 torr (continued hypoxia) while fluorescence was measured every 60 s for 600 s. A significant increase in fluorescence was detected in the reoxygenation group compared with hypoxic controls (p< 0.05). b, change in PO2 within the flow-through chamber after switching the gas mixture to normoxia att = 0 s.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test whether a partial inhibition of cytochrome oxidase function could elicit the same response as moderate hypoxia, sodium azide (1 mm) was added to the perfusate in cells maintained under normoxic conditions. In preliminary studies this concentration of azide was found to be sufficient to reduce the V max of cytochrome oxidase, but too low to limit respiration in cells. When azide was added, no immediate effect was seen but a progressive suppression in contractile motion developed over 2 h (Fig. 10). Washout of the azide required ∼10 min and was associated with a progressive return of contractile motion that mimicked the response to hypoxia. To assess the effects of azide (1 mm) on mitochondrial potential, cells loaded with TMRE were imaged every minute for 5 min, at which point sodium azide (1 mm) was added to the perfusate (Fig. 11). No acute decrease in potential was observed, suggesting that membrane potential was preserved. In other cells loaded with TMRE and incubated with azide for 2 h, washout of the azide was associated with an acute increase in membrane potential, suggesting that a relative hyperpolarization of the membrane had developed. These responses were similar to those seen during onset and recovery from moderate hypoxia.Figure 11TMRE fluorescence in of spontaneously contracting cardiomyocytes perfused with normoxic (PO2 = 100 torr; 14% O2) solution. Fluorescence images were obtained every 60 s for 700 s. In one group (Azide on), sodium azide (1 mm) was added to the perfusate at t = 300 s. A second group of cells had been continuously superfused with azide (1 mm) for 2 h prior to data collection. Att = 300 s, azide was removed from the perfusate as the cells continued to be imaged. A significant increase in fluorescence was detected after washout of the azide (n= 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Myocardial hibernation is a chronic abnormality of contractile function associated with coronary hypoperfusion (17Opie L.H. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 2403-2414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This dysfunction is reversed if coronary blood flow is restored, which suggests that the abnormality is not a consequence of ischemic cellular damage. Studies using 31P NMR spectroscopy suggest inorganic phosphate levels are not increased during hibernation, which supports the view that the attenuation of contraction is not a consequence of a reduction in energy stores (5Marban E. Circulation. 1991; 83: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying myocardial hibernation are not fully understood. We previously reported that spontaneously contracting cardiomyocytes down-regulate contractile motion and O2 consumption during prolonged (1–2 h) moderate hypoxia (PO2 = 25 torr) (7Budinger G.R.S. Chandel N. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Melmed A. Becker L.B. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L37-L53Google Scholar). Cells kept under those conditions for 24 h showed no decrement in viability, suggesting that the inhibition was not a consequence of cell damage. Similar findings of decreased contractile motion with sustained viability have recently been reported in rat cardiomyocytes cultured under 1% O2 for 48 h (8Silverman H.S. Wei S. Haigney M.C.P. Ocampo C.J. Stern M.D. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). That study indicates that our results are not unique to embryonic cells. Moreover, it extends our previous work by demonstrating that hibernating cardiac myocytes were more tolerant to acute severe hypoxic challenge, in terms of the time required to elicit ATP-depletion. These studies suggest that a phenomenon similar to myocardial hibernation develops in cardiac myocytes during prolonged hypoxia, which affords protection from anoxic stress and is reversible within hours after recovery to normoxic culture conditions. In this study, cardiomyocytes superfused at PO2 = 20 torr showed progressive decreases in contractile motion that reached 40% of control levels within ∼2 h. Recovery to PO2 = 100 torr was associated with a recovery of contraction, although several hours were required to reach base-line levels. We previously observed that cardiomyocytes maintained under normoxic conditions for ∼6 h showed no significant changes in contractile motion, so the observed response to hypoxia cannot be explained by the effects of time alone. During brief exposures to hypoxia, Rumsey et al. (18Rumsey W.L. Schlosser C. Nuutinen E.M. Robiolio M. Wilson D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15392-15402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that adult rat cardiac myocytes could maintain normal rates of O2 consumption until the extracellularPO2 fell to less than ∼7 torr (18Rumsey W.L. Schlosser C. Nuutinen E.M. Robiolio M. Wilson D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15392-15402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the observations that cells continued to function normally during the first hour of hypoxia and that the decreases in contraction were reversible suggest that the effects of hypoxia we found could not be explained by an O2 supply limitation of mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Nevertheless, to test whether hypoxia elicited ATP supply limitation, we used Magnesium Green to assess ATP hydrolysis in contracting cells during moderate hypoxia. The fluorescence of this dye increases with the intracellular Mg2+ concentration, which increases during ATP hydrolysis because ATP has a higher affinity for Mg2+ than does ADP (16Leyssens A. Nowicky A.V. Patterson L. Crompton M. Duchen M.R. J. Physiol. 1996; 496: 111-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Indeed, marked increases in fluorescence were seen in normoxic cells treated with the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP or with the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin, both of which should inhibit oxidative phosphorylation and cause ATP depletion. However, no increase in MgG fluorescence was seen during prolonged exposure to PO2 = 20 torr, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis was minimal. We previously measured [ATP] and [PCr] in quiescent cardiomyocytes and found that cellular levels were preserved during prolonged moderate hypoxia. The present study extends those results by showing that ATP levels are similarly preserved in contracting cells during prolonged hypoxia. To further test whether hypoxia elicited ATP supply limitation, we assessed mitochondrial potential using the dye TMRE. Mitochondrial membrane potential provides the driving force for ATP synthesis. The potential is generated by the supply of NADH through the matrix dehydrogenases and electron flux through electron transport chain. The ATP synthase uses the energy from mitochondrial membrane potential to synthesize ATP from ADP plus inorganic phosphate. In steady state, the mitochondrial membrane potential therefore reflects a balance between the rate of electron transport and the rate of ATP utilization by the cell. An inhibition within the electron transport chain during hypoxia would therefore result in a decrease in electron flux and a depolarization of the membrane, while a sudden inhibition of ATP utilization or an inhibition of the ATP synthase should produce a relative hyperpolarization. Indeed, these responses were observed when electron transport was inhibited with myxothiazol or when the ATP synthase was inhibited with oligomycin. Therefore, if hypoxia limited ATP synthesis by restricting mitochondrial electron transport, then a profound decrease in membrane potential should have been evident at the start of hypoxia in the TMRE studies. But mitochondrial potential was maintained during acute hypoxia, which suggests that ATP utilization and ATP synthesis remained closely matched. This conclusion is consistent with the absence of ATP hydrolysis indicated by the MgG data. Collectively, these findings suggest that hypoxia decreases respiration in cardiomyocytes by activating a signaling pathway that causes a reduction in contraction and ATP demand, rather than by limiting ATP supply. Although mitochondrial potential was not depleted during hypoxia, small increases in potential were detected at reoxygenation. This suggests that there was a rapid increase in electron transport without a corresponding increase in ATP utilization. Such an increase would be predicted if a partial inhibition of cytochrome oxidase were rapidly removed at reoxygenation. In previous studies of the oxidase, we have observed an immediate increase in V max upon reoxygenation after prolonged hypoxia (9Chandel N. Budinger G.R.S. Kemp R.A. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L918-L925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chandel N.S. Budinger G.R.S. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18672-18677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19Chandel N.S. Budinger G.R.S. Choe S.H. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18808-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We therefore conclude that the changes in mitochondrial potential at reoxygenation reflect functional changes in the kinetics of the oxidase that develop during prolonged hypoxia. These observations indicate that mitochondria can respond to changes in O2 tension within the physiological range, which could allow them to function as an O2 sensor. Sodium azide is a noncompetitive inhibitor of cytochromec oxidase (20Petersen L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 460: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). At high concentrations (5–10 mm) it can throttle respiration by limiting O2consumption, resulting in an immediate cessation of contraction and depletion of mitochondrial potential. By contrast, low concentrations (≤1 mm) merely reduce the V max of the enzyme without limiting basal respiration. Our previous studies indicated that prolonged hypoxia produces a reversible decrease inV max of the oxidase (7Budinger G.R.S. Chandel N. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Melmed A. Becker L.B. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L37-L53Google Scholar, 9Chandel N. Budinger G.R.S. Kemp R.A. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L918-L925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chandel N.S. Budinger G.R.S. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18672-18677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), which is not sufficient to limit basal respiration. Thus, low concentrations of azide could mimic the effects of hypoxia on the enzyme. Our observation that azide during normoxia produced the same changes in contractile function and mitochondrial potential seen during moderate hypoxia implicates cytochrome oxidase as the oxygen sensor underlying the functional response to hypoxia. The observation that cells respond to physiological levels of O2 suggests the existence of a signal transduction pathway linking the sensor to the functional response. Some investigators have argued that cytochrome oxidase is ill-suited to function as an O2 sensor because its apparent K m for O2 is <1 μm (8Silverman H.S. Wei S. Haigney M.C.P. Ocampo C.J. Stern M.D. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 21Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Therefore, at physiological O2 concentrations the velocity of such an enzyme system would remain independent of O2 until near-anoxic conditions were reached, limiting its ability to signal changes in the physiological range. However, changes in theV max of the oxidase produced with hypoxia or azide (1 mm) should increase the reduction state of mitochondrial electron carriers upstream from the oxidase (19Chandel N.S. Budinger G.R.S. Choe S.H. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18808-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that subsequent redox-linked activation of second messenger systems (22Monteiro H.P. Stern A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 23Laderoute K.R. Webster K.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) could then lead to an inhibition of ATP utilization within the cell. Although not yet confirmed, the above sequence would be consistent with (a) the previously observed changes in cytochrome oxidase V max during hypoxia, (b) the observed changes in mitochondrial potential during hypoxia and reoxygenation, (c) the possible delay between onset of hypoxia or reoxygenation and the changes in cell motion and ATP demand, and (d) the sustained coupling between cellular respiration and ATP demand as indicated by membrane potential and MgG. However, further study will be required to fully identify the signaling cascade(s) mediating the functional response. A number of similarities between the response to hypoxia in cardiomyocytes and that seen in hibernating myocardium should be noted. First, both appear to involve a matching between ATP utilization and O2 supply without evidence of ischemia. Second, both conditions are fully reversible upon restoration of base-line conditions, without loss of cell viability or necrotic damage. One notable difference is that contractile function in hibernating myocardium recovers immediately upon restoration of flow (24Heusch G. Schulz R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 2359-2372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), whereas recovery of cardiomyocytes required 2–3 h after restoration of normoxic conditions. Although the present study provides insight into the mechanisms contributing to the response to hypoxia in cardiomyocytes, further work will be required to clarify the relationship of these findings to the events in the intact hibernating myocardium."

Structural analysis performed by a combination of enzymatic digestions with 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that the isolated octasaccharides shared the common core structure ΔHexAα1–3GalNAcβ1–4(GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc)3 with four, five, and six sulfate esters at various hydroxyl groups in different combinations. In the structure, ΔHexA and GlcUA represent 4-deoxy-α-l-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid and glucuronic acid, respectively. No D-D tetrasaccharide sequence was found, and discrete D disaccharide units were demonstrated exclusively as A-D tetrasaccharide units in either an A-D-A or an A-D-C hexasaccharide sequence in the five octasaccharides that represented about 5.0% (w/w) of the starting polysaccharides (C denotes the disaccharide GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(6-sulfate)).

Eight octasaccharide fractions were isolated from CS-D after partial digestion with bacterial chondroitinase ABC by means of gel filtration chromatography and anion-exchange high performance liquid chromotography to investigate the frequency and the arrangement of the A-D tetrasaccharide unit in the polymer sequence. Structural analysis performed by a combination of enzymatic digestions with 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that the isolated octasaccharides shared the common core structure ΔHexAα1–3GalNAcβ1–4(GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc)3 with four, five, and six sulfate esters at various hydroxyl groups in different combinations. In the structure, ΔHexA and GlcUA represent 4-deoxy-α-l-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid and glucuronic acid, respectively. No D-D tetrasaccharide sequence was found, and discrete D disaccharide units were demonstrated exclusively as A-D tetrasaccharide units in either an A-D-A or an A-D-C hexasaccharide sequence in the five octasaccharides that represented about 5.0% (w/w) of the starting polysaccharides (C denotes the disaccharide GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(6-sulfate)). It remains to be determined whether such characteristic hexasaccharide sequences present in shark cartilage CS-D serve as functional domain structures recognized by some protein ligands.

CS-PGs are present on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix of most tissues and are involved in many biological activities. However, the structure of CS chains is only poorly understood. The backbone structure of CS chains consists of repeating disaccharide units, each containing a glucuronic acid (GlcUA) residue and an N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue. Diversity in ester-sulfation of both saccharide residues results in structural variability of CS chains, which is assumed to be the basis for its functional diversity. Immunological studies using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have revealed that the sulfation profile of CS chains changes with concomitant specific spatio-temporal patterns in various tissues, suggesting that CS isoforms differing in sulfation position and degree perform distinct functions in development (1Mark M.P. Baker J.R. Kimata K. Ruch J.-V. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1990; 34: 191-204PubMed Google Scholar). Disaccharide units with various sulfation profiles are non-randomly distributed in the CS chains as detected by mAbs (2Sorrell J.M. Carrino D.A. Caplan A.I. Matrix. 1993; 13: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).It had been shown previously that the CS-PG named DSD-1-PG from developing mouse brain is located on the surface of immature glial cells in the central nervous system and promotes neurite outgrowth (3Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The neurite outgrowth stimulating capacity of DSD-1-PG was strongly reduced by mAb 473HD, which recognizes a glycosaminoglycan epitope present in DSD-1-PG. Surprisingly, shark cartilage CS-C inhibited the interactions between the mAb 473HD and the DSD-1 epitope (3Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In agreement with this observation, neurite outgrowth promotion was also abolished by treatment with chondroitinase ABC, which removes the CS chains of the PG (3Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). It can be concluded from these data that the particular CS structure recognized by mAb 473HD is of physiological relevance in the context of neurite outgrowth. In addition, the rat brain 6B4 CS-PG/phosphacan, which corresponds to the extracellular region of a receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase, PTPζ/RPTPβ, was demonstrated to interact with pleiotrophin through the CS chains and the core protein, and to regulate pleiotrophin-induced neurite outgrowth (4Maeda N. Nishiwaki T. Shintani T. Hamanaka H. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21446-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The binding was specifically inhibited by shark cartilage CS-C. Structurally, shark cartilage CS chains possess a unique D disaccharide unit GlcUA(2S)β1–3GalNAc(6S) in addition to the common A and C disaccharide units (GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4S) and GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(6S)), where 2S, 4S, and 6S denote 2-O-, 4-O- and 6-O-sulfate, respectively (5Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 3580-3588Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). D units have been found not only in shark cartilage CS but also in the CS of the mouse mast cells derived from immune lymph nodes. The CS-D composed of A and D disaccharide units occurs transiently, functioning as an important phenotypic marker that distinguishes different mast cell subsets (6Davidson S. Gilead L. Amira M. Ginsburg H. Razin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12324-12330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CS in the basement membrane of embryonic mouse tooth germ also possesses D disaccharide units and appears transiently. A, C, and D units are produced in this order in a time-dependent manner (1Mark M.P. Baker J.R. Kimata K. Ruch J.-V. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1990; 34: 191-204PubMed Google Scholar), as demonstrated using mAbs including MO-225, which specifically recognizes the epitope containing a D disaccharide unit (7Yamagata M. Kimata K. Oike Y. Tani K. Maeda N. Toshida K. Shimomura Y. Yoneda M. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4146-4152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although there is accumulating evidence for the biological importance of CS-D, structural information regarding the sequential arrangement of its disaccharide units and its biosynthetic mechanisms remain unclear.To investigate the structural features and the biosynthetic mechanism of shark cartilage CS, we have been analyzing the structures of oligosaccharides prepared by bacterial chondroitinase or testicular hyaluronidase digestion of a shark cartilage CS-D isoform, which contains a larger proportion of D disaccharide units than CS-C (21.2versus 9.62%). Commercial CS-D and CS-C isoforms are purified from cranial cartilages of a shark strain Rhizoprionodon acutus (Rüppell) and a mixture of cartilages from various body parts of multiple shark strains, mainly Prionace glauca(Linnaeus), respectively, according to the manufacturer. Previous findings revealed a unique A-D tetrasaccharide sequence, GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4S)β1–4GlcUA(2S)β1–3GalNAc(6S), in one tetrasaccharide and in a few hexasaccharides (8Sugahara K. Nadanaka S. Takeda K. Kojima T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9Sugahara K. Tanaka Y. Yamada S. Glycoconjugate J. 1996; 13: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10Nadanaka S. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The A-D tetrasaccharide sequence is recognized by the mAb MO-225 (7Yamagata M. Kimata K. Oike Y. Tani K. Maeda N. Toshida K. Shimomura Y. Yoneda M. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4146-4152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its epitope is transiently expressed and disappears during developmental maturation of mouse odontoblasts, suggesting the epitope to be biologically functional (1Mark M.P. Baker J.R. Kimata K. Ruch J.-V. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1990; 34: 191-204PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to investigate the biological activity of CS-D especially in the context of neurite outgrowth, to clarify the distribution of D disaccharide units and A-D sequences along CS-D chains, and to characterize the sulfation profiles surrounding them by analyzing structures of larger oligosaccharides (i.e. octasaccharides). Preliminary data have been reported in abstract form (11Nadanaka S. Masayama K. Clement A. Faissner A. Sugahara K. Glycoconjugate J. 1997; 14: S15Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONPrevious studies indicated that mAb 473HD strongly reduced the stimulatory effect of DSD-1-PG on neurite outgrowth and that shark cartilage CS-C, which contains D disaccharide units, specifically inhibited the interactions between mAb 473HD and the CS chains of the DSD-1-PG isolated from mouse brains (3Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In this study, biological activities and the structure of shark cartilage CS-D, which contains a higher proportion of D units as compared with CS-C, were investigated. Consistent with the interpretation that the DSD-1-epitope is required for the neurite outgrowth promoting properties of DSD-1-PG, CS-D but not CS-C adsorbed to the culture substrate increased the fraction of neurite-bearing hippocampal neurons. For this reason, CS-D was selected for further structural studies. The significant neurite outgrowth promoting activity observed with squid cartilage CS-E was unexpected and seemingly contradictory to the observation that it did not exhibit significant inhibition of the mAb binding to DSD-1-PG (Fig. 1). However, it is noteworthy that a tetrasaccharide isolated from shark fin cartilage contained a unique sequence ΔHexA-GalNAc(4S,6S)-GlcUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S) with both an E and a D disaccharide unit, and was recognized by mAb MO-225 (7Yamagata M. Kimata K. Oike Y. Tani K. Maeda N. Toshida K. Shimomura Y. Yoneda M. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4146-4152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intriguing but puzzling observations concerning the CS-E activity remain to be pursued.Commercial shark cartilage CS-D is composed of four kinds of disaccharide units (A, GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4S); C, GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(6S); D, GlcUA(2S)β1–3GalNAc(6S); and E, GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4S,6S)) in a molar ratio of 26.9:44.2:21.2:2.0 as described in the specification provided by the manufacturer. A D unit has been demonstrated on the immediate reducing side of an A unit, forming an A-D tetrasaccharide sequence characteristic of shark cartilage CS-D. This A-D sequence has been found in three minor unsaturated hexasaccharides, corresponding to A-D-C, A-A-D, A-D-A sequences, prepared by partial chondroitinase ABC digestion as well as in one tetra- (A-D) and two hexasaccharides (D-A-D and C-A-D) prepared by exhaustive testicular hyaluronidase digestion as summarized in Table V. The propriety of the use of testicular hyaluronidase with a transglycosylation activity for preparing oligosaccharides has been discussed (10Nadanaka S. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, eight octasaccharides were isolated from the same source after partial digestion with chondroitinase ABC, which has no transglycosylation activity. These octasaccharides, composed of A, C, or D units but devoid of an E unit, included two tetrasulfated (fractions I and II), five pentasulfated (fractions IV, Va, Vb, VIa, and VIb), and one hexasulfated (fraction VIII) structure. The A-D sequence was found in five major fractions in the following sequences as shown in Table V; A-A-D-C (Va), C-A-D-C (Vb), A-A-D-A (VIa), C-A-D-A (VIb), and D-A-D-A (VIII). Thus, the A-D sequence was not unusual as previously presumed (10Nadanaka S. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but appeared rather frequently. Although the octasaccharide fraction analyzed in this study accounted for only approximately 7.5% (w/w) of the starting CS-D, the revealed sequences indicated that the disaccharide unit located on the immediate non-reducing side of an A-D sequence was an A, C or D unit, whereas that on the reducing side was not a D unit but an A or C unit, forming an A-D-A or an A-D-C hexasaccharide sequence (i.e.GlcUA-GalNAc(4S)-GlcUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S)-GlcUA-GalNAc(4S or 6S)). In other words, D units were not found consecutively as a D-D sequence unlike A-A or C-C sequences, as has been suggested based on the structural studies of the tetrasaccharides generated by digestion with specific chondroitinases AC-I, AC-II, and AC-III (31Yoshida K. Kikuchi H. Miyazono H. Maeyama K. Morikawa K. Tawada A. Suzuki S. Glycoconjugate J. 1995; 12: 488Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The characteristic hexasaccharide sequences most likely reflect the biosynthetic mechanisms: specificities of 2-O- and 6-O-sulfotransferases responsible for producing a D disaccharide unit. It remains to be determined whether such hexasaccharide sequences are associated indeed with biological functions such as a neurite outgrowth promoting activity, and whether the D unit is contained in the CS chains of DSD-1-PG. A preliminary disaccharide composition analysis after chondroitinase AC-II digestion of a limited amount of purified DSD-1-PG showed a peak representing approximately 5% of the total disaccharide units at the elution position of the authentic ΔDi-diSD unit on HPLC. 3A. Clement, S. Nadanaka, K. Sugahara, and A. Faissner, unpublished results. The D unit has been identified not only in shark cartilage, but also in mouse mast cells derived from immune lymph nodes (6Davidson S. Gilead L. Amira M. Ginsburg H. Razin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12324-12330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in the basement membrane of mouse tooth germ for a brief period (1Mark M.P. Baker J.R. Kimata K. Ruch J.-V. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1990; 34: 191-204PubMed Google Scholar). Characteristic sequences including D units may serve as functional domain structures recognized by some protein ligands. Thus, the structural arrangement of D units along CS chains, its function, and biosynthetic mechanism are of particular interest.Table VOligosaccharides isolated from shark cartilage CS-DEven-numbered oligosaccharides prepared by digestion withChondroitinase ABC5-aOligosaccharides prepared by chondroitinase digestion are unsaturated with a ΔHexA residue at the non-reducing end.Testicular hyaluronidase5-bOligosaccharides prepared by testicular hyaluronidase digestion are saturated with a GlcUA residue at the non-reducing end.Octasaccharides (7.5)5-cThe number in parentheses represents the percentage of the even-numbered oligosaccharides (w/w) relative to the total polysaccharides.Hexasaccharides5-dReported in Ref. 8.(7.8)Tetrasaccharides5-eReported in Ref. 13.(23.0)Hexasaccharides5-fReported in Ref. 10.(28.2)Tetrasaccharides5-gReported in Ref. 9.

Open table in a new tab Chondroitinase ABC, which is an indispensable analytical tool, has recently become a subject for discussion in terms of its purity and mechanism of action. Until recently, it had been believed to be an endoeliminase that splits β1,4-galactosaminidic bonds of CS and dermatan sulfate chains. However, our recent findings raised questions concerning its purity and mechanism of action. The conventional commercial preparation contained a minor protein component in addition to a major one corresponding to the highly purified enzyme as revealed by SDS-PAGE, and the latter enzyme did not digest tetrasaccharides (see the second paragraph of “Results”; see also Ref. 13Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, highly purified chondroitinase ABC preferentially acted on the unsaturated hexasaccharides in an exolytic fashion, releasing only the disaccharide units at the non-reducing ends (8Sugahara K. Nadanaka S. Takeda K. Kojima T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the conventional preparation of chondroitinase ABC has been claimed to have a non-random endolytic action (27Jandik K.A. Gu K. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast, the same preparation has also been reported to release di-, tetra-, and hexasaccharides from the non-reducing ends of CS polysaccharides in an exolytic fashion (32Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J. Hey N.J. Hazell P.K. Kee W.J. Ewins R.J.F. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, it had become necessary to define its endolytic or exolytic actions to apply it as an analytical tool. Very recently, after the completion of this work, Hamai et al. (26Hamai A. Hashimoto N. Mochizuki H. Kato F. Makiguchi Y. Horie K. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9123-9130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) reported purifying two chondroitinase ABCs from Proteus vulgaris and crystallizing them. One enzyme, designated exochondroitinase ABC, was demonstrated to be an exoeliminase preferentially acting on CS tetra- and hexasaccharides to yield respective disaccharides, and corresponded to the minor protein bond observed in the conventional enzyme preparation by SDS-PAGE in our previous study (13Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The other, designated endochondroitinase ABC, corresponded to the highly purified enzyme and was shown to act on polymer CS and dermatan sulfate chains endolytically, whereas it did not act on tetrasaccharides, which is in good agreement with our findings (13Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).In this study, however, exolytic actions of this latter enzyme on octasaccharides were revealed. Structural analysis of highly purified chondroitinase ABC digests of fractions Vb and VIb indicated that the enzyme split the individual octasaccharides into two tetrasaccharide fragments acting on the central galactosaminidic linkages by approximately 20% (Table III), whereas the other octasaccharides were digested exclusively, if not completely, in an exolytic action releasing disaccharide units sequentially from the non-reducing ends. The activity that produced two tetrasaccharides from an octasaccharide is probably attributable to an endolytic activity as claimed by Hamaiet al. (26Hamai A. Hashimoto N. Mochizuki H. Kato F. Makiguchi Y. Horie K. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9123-9130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In conclusion, highly purified chondroitinase ABC (endochondroitinase ABC) that shows primarily an endolytic action on CS/dermatan sulfate polymers (26Hamai A. Hashimoto N. Mochizuki H. Kato F. Makiguchi Y. Horie K. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9123-9130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) has a strong tendency to exert an exolytic action when acting on oligosaccharides such as hexa- and octasaccharides. It cleaves disaccharide units from the non-reducing ends always when acting on hexasaccharides and can cleave tetrasaccharide fragments probably in an endolytic fashion when acting on octasaccharides depending on the sequences although the disaccharide-releasing exolytic activity still dominates the tetrasaccharide-releasing endolytic activity. Thus, the enzyme is useful for determining the tetrasaccharide sequence located on the reducing side of at least hexa-, octa-, and maybe larger oligosaccharides as well. Investigation of the size and sequence dependence of its action will make it more useful. It is interesting to note that chondroitinase ABC from F. heparinum has also been reported to degrade CS and dermatan sulfate chains in an exolytic fashion, but beginning from the reducing end of the molecules (33Michelacci Y.M.

The 14-3-3ζ and 14-3-3ε isoforms were isolated in a two-hybrid screen for proteins interacting with the N-terminal regulatory domain of MEKK3. 14-3-3 proteins bound both the N-terminal regulatory and C-terminal kinase domains of MEKK3. The binding affinity of 14-3-3 for the MEKK3 N terminus was 90 nm, demonstrating a high affinity interaction. 14-3-3 proteins also interacted with MEKK1 and MEKK2, but not MEKK4. Endogenous 14-3-3 protein and MEKK1 and MEKK2 were similarly distributed in the cell, consistent with their in vitrointeractions. MEKK1 and 14-3-3 proteins colocalized using two-color digital confocal immunofluorescence. Binding of 14-3-3 proteins mapped to the N-terminal 393 residues of 196-kDa MEKK1. Unlike MEKK2 and MEKK3, the C-terminal kinase domain of MEKK1 demonstrated little or no ability to interact with 14-3-3 proteins. MEKK1, but not MEKK2, -3 or -4, is a caspase-3 substrate that when cleaved releases the kinase domain from the N-terminal regulatory domain. Functionally, caspase-3 cleavage of MEKK1 releases the kinase domain from the N-terminal 14-3-3-binding region, demonstrating that caspases can selectively alter protein kinase interactions with regulatory proteins. With regard to MEKK1, -2 and -3, 14-3-3 proteins do not appear to directly influence activity, but rather function as “scaffolds” for protein-protein interactions.

The biological consequence of binding of 14-3-3 proteins is controversial, but the importance of 14-3-3 proteins in controlling signal transduction pathways is beginning to emerge. For Raf-1, 14-3-3 binding has been reported to enhance, suppress, or play no role in regulating kinase activity (Refs. 14Fu H. Xia K. Pallas D.C. Cui C. Conroy K. Narsimhan R.P. Mamon H. Collier R.J.

Furthermore, 14-3-3 binding has been shown to protect phosphoserine residues from phosphatases and function as a scaffold to promote association with other proteins (27Dent P. Jelinek T.

Expression of 14-3-3 proteins in Xenopus oocytes activates the ERK pathway, and 14-3-3 proteins can potentiate ERK activation by KSR (22Xing H. Kornfeld K. Muslin A.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 294-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, D14-3-3 is necessary for photoreceptor development and genetically maps upstream of Raf and downstream of Ras (30Chang H.C. Rubin G.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1132-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31Kockel L. Vorbruggen G. Jackle H. Mlodzik M. Bohmann D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1140-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the fission yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe, 14-3-3 proteins regulate a DNA-damage checkpoint (32Ford J.C. Al-Khodairy F. Fotou E. Sheldrick K.S. Griffiths D.J.F. Carr A.M. Science. 1994; 265: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and in the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, 14-3-3 proteins are essential for regulation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway during pseudohyphal development (33Roberts R.L. Mosch H.U. Fink G.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 1055-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Structurally, 14-3-3 proteins dimerize with each subunit having a cleft that could function as a binding site for proteins and could induce the close proximity of different proteins to alter their interaction and regulation (34Xiao B. Smerdon S.J. Jones D.H. Dodson G.G. Soneji Y. Aitken A. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Thus, 14-3-3 proteins are essential for regulated signal transduction and may not directly activate or inhibit kinases, but rather behave as a “scaffold” or “anchor” to localize protein kinase activity. In this report, we demonstrate that 14-3-3 proteins interact with MEKK1, -2, and -3, but not MEKK4. These findings implicate 14-3-3 proteins in the control of MEKK proteins as “scaffold-like” proteins since association does not directly influence kinase activity. In addition, we demonstrate that caspase-3 cleavage of MEKK1 releases the active kinase domain from the N-terminal 14-3-3-binding region, defining a new function for caspases, namely the release of active kinase from its cellular scaffold. Yeast two-hybrid interaction analysis was performed as essentially described by Vojtek and Hollenberg (35Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Plasmids pVP16, pBTM116, and pBTM116-lamin and the L40 yeast strain were kindly provided by Drs. Anne B. Vojtek and Jonathan A. Cooper. The N-terminal coding region of MEKK3 (amino acids 4–361) was subcloned into pBTM116 (pBTM116-MEKK3(NH2)), and sequence was confirmed using an Applied Biosystems Model 377 automated DNA sequencer. pBTM116-MEKK3(NH2) was transformed into the L40 yeast strain, propagated under the appropriate selection, and expression of the fusion protein (LexA-MEKK3) was determined in protein extract preparations (36Printen J.A. Sprague G.F. Genetics. 1994; 138: 609-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by immunoblotting with a LexA monoclonal antibody (kindly provided by Drs. John A. Printen and George F. Sprague, Jr.). The L40 yeast strain containing pBTM116-MEKK3(NH2) was transformed with a murine day 9.5 and 10.5 embryonic library in pVP16 (kindly provided by Dr. Stanley M. Hollenberg). Histidine prototrophy was determined on plates containing either 1 or 5 mm 3-aminotriazole to screen for proteins with lower and higher affinities for MEKK3(NH2). β-Galactosidase activity was utilized as a secondary screen. Clones that tested positive for both interaction screens were sequenced and identified using the BLAST algorithm to search the nucleotide data base at the National Library of Medicine (37Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Meyers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70715) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in a humidified CO2 environment in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). PC12 cells were cultured in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum. COS cell growth medium contained 5% newborn calf serum and 5% calf serum. HEK293 cells were cultured in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Where indicated, cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Full-length 14-3-3ε cDNA was obtained by polymerase chain reaction from a mouse brain cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using primers encompassing the 5′-start site and the 3′-stop site. Nucleotide sequence was confirmed by comparison with the reported sequence for 14-3-3ε (GenBank™ accession number Z19599). 14-3-3ε was subcloned into pGEX-5X-1 (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), expressed inEscherichia coli strain JM109, and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions. Either untransfected PC12 cells or HEK293 cells transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated MEKK family member were lysed in buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mmTris, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 50 mm sodium chloride, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin and incubated with 10 μg of immobilized GST or GST-14-3-3ε at 4 °C for 3 h. Following washing of each reaction, the samples were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western-blotted with the indicated antibody. The N-terminal portion of MEKK3 (amino acids 4–361) was subcloned into the maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion vector pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA). MBP-MEKK3(NH2) was purified from bacteria using amylose affinity chromatography as described by the manufacturer. MBP-MEKK3(NH2) was also used as an antigen to generate rabbit polyclonal antibodies. MEKK3(NH2), produced from bacterially expressed MBP-MEKK3(NH2) that was cleaved with Factor Xa, was conjugated to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) and used to affinity-purify specific MEKK3 antibodies. 35S-Labeled 196-kDa MEKK1 was generated using a coupled reticulocyte lysate expression system (Promega, Madison, WI). Equal amounts of 196-kDa MEKK1 were incubated for 1 h in cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm EGTA) with 1 μg of bacterially expressed and purified GST or GST-14-3-3 eluted from the glutathione-Sepharose beads. Jurkat cells were used as a source of caspase activity when 6 μg of lysate derived from cells that were either unstimulated or stimulated with Fas was added, and the reaction was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and bands were visualized by autoradiography. For analysis of JNK activity, cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids along with a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged form of JNK. After 48 h, the cells were lysed, and JNK activity was assayed following immunoprecipitation of HA-JNK with an anti-HA antibody (Berkeley Antibody Co., Richmond, CA) using c-Jun as a substrate as described by Fanger et al. (6Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). To assay MEKK activity, cells transfected with either empty plasmid or HA-tagged forms of 196-kDa MEKK1 or MEKK2 were lysed, and MEKK1 or MEKK2 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody. Immunoprecipitates were incubated with 1 μg of either GST or GST-14-3-3 for 1 h at 4 °C before [32P]ATP and a catalytically inactive form of JNK kinase (K → R) were added and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Samples were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and JNK kinase phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography. The Biacore 2000 was utilized to analyze the association of recombinant MEKK3 and 14-3-3 protein expressed in and purified from bacteria (for review, see Ref.38Raghavan M. Bjorkman P.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 331-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). GST or GST-14-3-3ε was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip via an anti-GST monoclonal antibody (Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). For the immobilized protein, concentration and flow rate were assayed to yield consistent 500–1000 response units, which were utilized for each experiment. Recombinant MBP-MEKK3(NH2) binding was assayed at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at concentrations ranging from 10 to 1000 nm. Data were collected on a NEC Powermate V100 using the Biacore control software program. The relative affinity of MEKK3(NH2) for 14-3-3 was determined using the BIAevaluation 2.0 software program by determining theK on and K off rates for this interaction by nonlinear curve-fitting methods. Cells were fixed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 3% paraformaldehyde and 3% sucrose and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. The cells were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against peptides corresponding to MEKK1, MEKK2, 14-3-3β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and 14-3-3ε (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h, washed, incubated with 1.5 mg/ml Cy3-conjugated affinity-purified donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA), and mounted onto slides with 20 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine in 1m Tris (pH 8.5). To determine colocalization with 14-3-3 proteins, endogenous MEKK1 was localized with a monoclonal antibody raised against the C terminus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The colocalization index was calculated using deconvolution and segmentation analysis with slidebook imaging software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations Inc., Denver, CO) by determining the number of components that stained positive for either MEKK1 or 14-3-3 and calculating the percentage that stained for both molecules. Cells were visualized by digital confocal immunofluorescence, and images were captured with a cooled CCD camera mounted on a Leica DMR/XA microscope using a 63× Plan Neo objective. Yeast two-hybrid interaction analysis (39Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar) was used to identify proteins that interact with MEKKs. In one set of screens, the N-terminal regulatory domain of MEKK3 (amino acids 4–361) was fused in frame to the DNA-binding domain of LexA (pBTM116) and used to screen a mouse embryonic library subcloned into pVP16. Histidine prototrophy in the presence of 1 or 5 mm 3-aminotriazole and β-galactosidase activity were used for selection of proteins interacting with the N terminus of MEKK3. 1.7 × 107transformants were screened. Of the 100 clones selected for sequence analysis, one 14-3-3ζ clone and six 14-3-3ε clones were identified by comparison with the nucleotide data base at the National Library of Medicine using the BLAST algorithm. Four of the 14-3-3ε clones and the 14-3-3ζ clone were obtained from plates containing 5 mm 3-aminotriazole, suggesting a high affinity interaction between these proteins and the N terminus of MEKK3. Fig. 1 (A and B) shows that 14-3-3ε interacted with both the N- and C-terminal moieties as well as with full-length MEKK3. Identification of binding sites in both the MEKK3 N-terminal regulatory and C-terminal kinase domains was similar to that for Raf-1, which has 14-3-3 interaction sequences in the regulatory and catalytic domains (14Fu H. Xia K. Pallas D.C. Cui C. Conroy K. Narsimhan R.P. Mamon H. Collier R.J. Roberts T.M. Science. 1994; 266: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 19Freed E. Symons M. Macdonald S.G.

When cells were first stimulated with epidermal growth factor, there was an ∼2-fold increase in MEKK3 binding to GST-14-3-3ε-Sepharose beads. MEKK3 becomes serine/threonine-phosphorylated when cells are stimulated by growth factor, 4R. R. Vaillancourt and G. L. Johnson, unpublished observations. and this could increase its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. The putative N-terminal regulatory domain of MEKK3 can be readily expressed in bacteria and purified as a fusion protein with MBP to produce MBP-MEKK3(NH2). Surface plasmon resonance analysis demonstrated a KD of 90 nm for the interaction of MBP-MEKK3(NH2) with immobilized GST-14-3-3ε (Fig. 2). Unfortunately, we have not succeeded in preparing functional full-length or C-terminal kinase domain of MEKK3 for similar analysis, but the high affinity interaction of 14-3-3 protein with the N terminus of MEKK3 suggests that this is an interaction relevant to the regulation of MEKK3 by 14-3-3 proteins in cells. To determine if 14-3-3 proteins associated with other MEKK proteins, full-length MEKK1, -2, -3, and -4 with the HA tag at their N termini were expressed in HEK293 cells. Immunoblotting with the HA tag antibody (12CA5) was used to normalize for expression of each MEKK (Fig. 3). MEKK2 and MEKK3 migrate as ∼80-kDa proteins, and MEKK4 is ∼180 kDa. Full-length MEKK1 is 196 kDa, but, when expressed in HEK293 cells, is partially proteolyzed to generate two large N-terminal fragments of ∼134 kDa (fragment A) and 113 kDa (fragment B). We have demonstrated that the 113-kDa fragment B is the result of cleavage of MEKK1 by caspase-3 at Asp-874, which also generates a 91-kDa C-terminal activated kinase domain.2MEKK2, -3, and -4 are not caspase substrates.3 Incubation of the HEK293 lysates expressing MEKK1, -2, -3, or -4 with GST-14-3-3ε-Sepharose beads demonstrated that MEKK1, -2, and -3, but not MEKK4, associated with 14-3-3ε (Fig. 3). Full-length MEKK2 and MEKK3 similarly bound to 14-3-3ε. Both full-length MEKK1 and the N-terminal cleavage fragment of MEKK1 bound to 14-3-3ε. In several experiments, no binding of MEKK4 to 14-3-3ε protein could be detected, although functional MEKK4 protein was expressed as determined by its stimulation of JNK activity (data not shown). The failure of MEKK4 to bind 14-3-3 proteins demonstrates a difference in the regulation of MEKK1, -2, and -3 relative to MEKK4. In this regard, transfection-mediated expression of MEKK1, -2, and -3 results in constitutively activated MEKK proteins that can strongly activate JNK. In contrast, overexpression of full-length MEKK4 has a modest ability to activate the JNK pathway, whereas the MEKK4 catalytic domain strongly activates JNK (3Gerwins P. Blank J.L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8288-8295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Cumulatively, these results indicate that the regulatory properties of MEKK4 are different from those of the other MEKKs. One role of 14-3-3 proteins is to interact with phosphorylated amino acids, resulting in protection from dephosphorylation by phosphatases and potential alterations in overall protein activity (27Dent P. Jelinek T. Morrison D.K. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1995; 268: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 28Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S.

Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar). Although the phosphorylation sites of full-length MEKK1, -2, and -3 have not been identified, phosphorylation sites have been mapped to the C-terminal catalytic domain of MEKK1 (41Siow Y.W. Kalmar G.B. Sanghera J.S. Tai G. Oh S.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7586-7594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to focus on the kinase domains of MEKK1, -2, and -3 as potential sites for interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. The kinase domains of MEKK1, -2, and -3 show dramatically different abilities to bind 14-3-3ε (Fig. 4). Although there were equivalent amounts of protein expression in cell lysates, the kinase domain of MEKK2 consistently displayed a decreased ability to associate with 14-3-3ε relative to MEKK3. The kinase domain of MEKK1, which is serine/threonine-phosphorylated at multiple sites, was unable to bind to 14-3-3ε. With respect to 14-3-3 interactions, these results indicate that the kinase domains of MEKK1, -2, and -3 are inherently different, even though their amino acid sequence is conserved. Thus, interaction of 14-3-3 proteins with the kinase domains of MEKK2 and MEKK3, and not the kinase domain of MEKK1, provides a mechanism to differentially regulate MEKK activity within the cell. The inability of the kinase domain of MEKK1 to bind 14-3-3 proteins prompted us to determine if the 91-kDa C-terminal kinase domain (Fig. 5 A), created by caspase-3 cleavage, was able to bind 14-3-3. Fig. 5 B shows that, even though they were expressed at similar levels, the 196-kDa full-length MEKK1 protein associated with 14-3-3ε unlike the 91-kDa C-terminal MEKK1 protein, which displayed little associative properties for 14-3-3ε. This result is consistent with the inability of the kinase domain (see Fig. 4) and the first 300 amino acids (data not shown) of the 91-kDa kinase domain of MEKK1 to bind 14-3-3ε. Fig. 5 Cshows that multiple deletion products encoding different regions of the N terminus of 196-kDa MEKK1 bind to 14-3-3ε. Minimally, the N-terminal 393 amino acids of MEKK1 are sufficient to bind 14-3-3ε. This region is upstream of the predicted pleckstrin homology domain encoded in the MEKK1 sequence. Therefore, although 196-kDa MEKK1 binds to 14-3-3 proteins via a domain that is located in the first 393 amino acids, the 91-kDa C-terminal kinase domain does not associate with 14-3-3 proteins. Since 14-3-3 proteins associate with MEKK1 and caspase cleavage of MEKK1 is an important component of the apoptotic response (9Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G.L. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), we next determined whether association of 14-3-3 protein would influence caspase cleavage in vivo and in vitro. [35S]Methionine-labeled MEKK1 was recombinantly expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and combined with either GST as a negative control or GST-14-3-3. Following binding of 14-3-3 protein to MEKK1, caspase-mediated cleavage was induced by adding Jurkat lysate"

We recently demonstrated that the mutation of Ser-267 to Ile in the α1 subunit abolished ethanol regulation of glycine receptors (Gly-R). In the present study, a pair of chimeric receptors was studied, in which a 45-amino acid domain comprising transmembrane domains 2 and 3 was exchanged between the Gly-Rα1 and γ-aminobutyric acid ρ1 subunits. Detailed pharmacologic analysis of these chimeras confirmed that this domain of the Gly-R confers enhancement of receptor function by ethanol and butanol. An extensive series of mutations at Ser-267 in the Gly-Rα1 subunit was also prepared, and the resulting homomeric receptors were expressed and tested for sensitivity to glycine, and allosteric modulation by alcohols. All of the mutant receptors expressed successfully in Xenopus oocytes. Mutation of Ser-267 to small amino acid residues such as Gly or Ala produced receptors in which glycine responses were potentiated by ethanol. As we have reported previously, the mutant Gly-Rα1 (Ser-267 → Ile) was completely insensitive to ethanol; mutation of Ser-267 to Val had a similar effect. Mutation of Ser-267 to large residues such as His, Cys, or Tyr resulted in inhibition of Gly-R function by ethanol. These results demonstrate that the size of the amino acid residue at position α267 plays a crucial role in determining the functional consequences of allosteric modulation of the Gly-R by alcohols.

These results demonstrate that the size of the amino acid residue at position α267 plays a crucial role in determining the functional consequences of allosteric modulation of the Gly-R by alcohols. Depression of central nervous system function by ethanol is a complex phenomenon (1Deitrich R.A. Dunwiddie T.V. Harris R.A. Erwin V.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1989; 41: 491-537Google Scholar, 2Samson H.H. Harris R.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), which may involve several neurotransmitter systems. Ligand-gated ion channels play an important role in the regulation of neuronal excitability and are sensitive to pharmacologically relevant concentrations of ethanol. Several such channels are thought to be involved in the behavioral effects of ethanol, for example the NMDA 1The abbreviations used are: NMDA, N-methyl d-aspartate-preferring; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; Gly-R, glycine receptor; TM, transmembrane; HEK, human embryonic kidney. and non-NMDA subtypes of glutamate receptors (3Lovinger D.M.

Pharmacological Effects of Ethanol on the Nervous System. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1996: 51-72Google Scholar). Recent data also suggest that the related glycine receptor (Gly-R) may also be an important site of alcohol action. Gly-Rs constitute the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor system in the brainstem and spinal cord but are also found in significant numbers in higher brain regions such as the olfactory bulb, midbrain, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex (7Betz H. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 458-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Evidence has recently been obtained to implicate the Gly-R in some of the behavioral effects of ethanol. Intracerebroventricular administration of glycine augments ethanol-induced loss of righting reflex in the mouse (8Williams K.L. Ferko A.P. Barbieri E.J. DiGregorio G.J. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1995; 50: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and this effect is blocked by the glycine antagonist strychnine. Enhancement of Gly-R function would be consistent with the behavioral actions of ethanol in vivo. Electrophysiological studies have shown that ethanol enhances Gly-R function in spinal cord neurons from mouse and chick (9Celentano J.J. Gibbs T.T. Farb D.H. Brain Res. 1988; 455: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 10Aguayo L.G. Pancetti F.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 61-69PubMed Google Scholar), and increases glycine-mediated Cl−uptake into rat brain synaptoneurosomes (11Engblom A.C. Åkerman K.E.O. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 384-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recently, Mascia et al. (12Mascia M.P. Mihic S.J. Schofield P. Harris R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 402-406PubMed Google Scholar, 13Mascia M.P. Machu T.K. Harris R.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 1331-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) demonstrated ethanol enhancement of the function of Gly-R of defined composition expressed in Xenopus oocytes, with concentrations of ethanol as low as 10 mm being effective in potentiating the actions of low concentrations of glycine. Gly-Rs are members of the “superfamily” of related ligand-gated ion channels (14Betz H. Neuron. 1990; 5: 383-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 15Ortells M.O. Lunt G.G. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 16Vandenberg R.J. Schofield P.R. Handbook of Membrane Channels. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1994: 317-332Crossref Google Scholar). These receptors are pentameric complexes, with the five subunits arranged around a central pore through which permeant ions pass. The composition of most native neuronal glycine receptors is believed to be α1α1α1ββ, but receptors can also be efficiently assembled from α1 subunits alone. Each subunit has four putative transmembrane (TM) domains, with the second (TM2) believed to form the lining of the pore. We have recently demonstrated that ethanol enhancement of Gly-R function involves a critical domain encompassing TM2 and TM3 of the α subunit, and that a specific point mutation within TM2 (Ser-267 → Ile) could completely remove ethanol enhancement of Gly-R function (17Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M. Koltchine V.V. Finn S.E. Krasowski M.D. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). In the present study, we extended our original observations on the critical TM2/TM3 domain by studying in detail alcohol modulation of a complementary pair of receptor chimeras created by domain exchange between Gly-Rα1 and the GABA ρ1 subunit, another member of the ligand-gated chloride channel “subfamily,” which can readily form homomeric receptors. We also studied an extensive series of single amino acid replacements at Ser-267 in the Gly-Rα1 subunit, and have investigated the effects of each mutation on allosteric modulation by ethanol. A pair of chimeric receptors, denoted C1 and C2, were first constructed by methods described previously (17Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M. Koltchine V.V. Finn S.E. Krasowski M.D. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). The C1 chimera contains mostly Gly-Rα1, except the large intracellular loop and TM4, which are from GABA ρ1. C2 is the converse chimera, consisting mostly of GABA ρ1, except for the large intracellular loop and TM4 from Gly-Rα1. Using site-directed mutagenesis methods described below, a uniqueBssHII restriction site was then introduced into the cDNA sequence encoding the conserved amino acid sequence “PAR” at the beginning of TM2 in both C1 and C2 chimeras. Utilizing a uniqueSspI restriction site existing on the vector pCIS2, theBssHII/SspI fragments were exchanged, resulting in chimeric receptors C6 and C7 (Fig. 1). All chimeric receptors were confirmed by double-stranded sequencing (Sequenase 2.0, U.S. Biochemical Corp.). To create the point mutant series at Gly-Rα1 Ser-267, mutations were introduced into the cDNA encoding the human Gly-Rα1 subunit at bases 883–885, with simultaneous loss of a SacI restriction site. Oligonucleotides 24–30 bases in length were obtained from Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA), 5′-phosphorylated using polynucleotide kinase, and used to create mutations using the unique site elimination method (USE kit; Pharmacia Biotech; Ref. 18Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). SspI digestion was then used to select in favor of mutants, and clones were screened for the appearance of the desired mutation by digestion withSacI. All restriction enzymes and polynucleotide kinase were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). In addition, a few mutations were created using a Pfu-based polymerase chain reaction method (QuikChange; Stratagene). The sequences of both 5′- and 3′-cDNA termini and the sequences through the mutation site were confirmed by sequencing. The methods used for oocyte preparation and cDNA nuclear injection, and the electrophysiological assay of receptor function usingXenopus oocytes have been described previously (19Mihic S.J. Whiting P.J. Harris R.A. Eur J. Pharmacol. 1994; 268: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Drugs were applied for 0.5–3 min (depending on the GABA or glycine concentration), by which time the peak current response was obtained. A 5-min washout period was allowed between applications when low GABA or glycine concentrations were used, increasing to 10 min for higher concentrations. Modulatory drugs were always tested against an EC10 concentration of glycine or GABA, i.e. a concentration of agonist giving 10% of the maximal response obtainable in that egg. Data were always obtained from 4–13 oocytes taken from at least two different frogs. Wild-type or mutant glycine receptor cDNAs were also expressed by transfecting human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells as described previously (21Koltchine V.V. Ye Q. Finn S.E. Harrison N.L. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1445-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recordings from HEK 293 cells were made using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, as described in previous publications (21Koltchine V.V. Ye Q. Finn S.E. Harrison N.L. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1445-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes contained (in mm): 145 N-methyl-d-glucamine hydrochloride, 5 K2ATP, 1.1 EGTA, 2 MgCl2, 5 HEPES/KOH, 0.1 CaCl2 (pH 7.2). Pipette resistance was 4–5 megohms. The extracellular medium contained (in mm): 145 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 6d-glucose, 10 HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4). HEK 293 cells were voltage clamped at −60 mV. In addition to the continuous slow bath perfusion, the extracellular saline, glycine, and the alcohols were rapidly applied to the cell by local perfusion using a motor-driven solution exchange device (Bio Logic Rapid Solution Changer RSC-100; Molecular Kinetics, Pullman, WA) (21Koltchine V.V. Ye Q. Finn S.E. Harrison N.L. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1445-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Numerical data are presented throughout as mean ± S.E. ATP was from Calbiochem; ethanol was from AAPER Alcohol & Chemical Co.; butanol (HPLC-grade) was from Sigma; strychnine, bicuculline, and picrotoxin were from RBI (Natick, MA); all other chemicals were from Sigma. Ethanol potentiation of Gly-Rα1 receptor function has previously been described in receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes (12Mascia M.P. Mihic S.J. Schofield P. Harris R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 402-406PubMed Google Scholar,17Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M. Koltchine V.V. Finn S.E. Krasowski M.D. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). In the present study, we extend these observations to the longer chain alcohol, n-butanol, and to Gly-Rα1 expressed in the HEK 293 cell line. Fig. 2 Aillustrates the potentiation of glycine responses by ethanol (100–200 mm) in a cell expressing wild-type Gly-Rα1. Concentration-response analysis revealed a leftward shift of the entire glycine dose-response curve in the presence of 100 mmethanol, with no significant change in the maximal current amplitude elicited by glycine (Fig. 2 C), indicating that the alcohol causes an increase in the apparent affinity of the receptor for glycine. A similar potentiating action and a leftward shift of the glycine concentration-response curve was seen with butanol (Fig. 2, B and D), although, as expected, butanol was more potent than ethanol. A complementary pair of chimeric receptors was tested, in which a 45-amino acid domain had been exchanged between Gly-Rα1 (the function of which is enhanced by ethanol, as shown above) and GABA-Rρ1 (the function of which is inhibited by ethanol; Ref. 22Mihic S.J. Harris R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 277: 411-416PubMed Google Scholar). The first chimera tested was denoted “C7” (nomenclature from Ref.17Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M. Koltchine V.V. Finn S.E. Krasowski M.D. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar), consisting almost entirely of Gly-Rα1, with the 45-amino acid TM2-TM3 domain provided by GABA ρ1 (Fig. 1). This chimera expressed relatively poorly in HEK 293 cells, relative to wild-type Gly-Rα1, but could be gated by glycine. Interestingly, although the TM2 domain was contributed by GABA ρ1, the kinetics of both activation and deactivation were rapid, resembling the gating behavior of the wild-type Gly-Rα1 (Fig. 3 A), with an EC50 of 293 μm and a Hill coefficient of 1.3 (Fig. 3 C). The converse chimera, denoted C6 (see Fig. 1), consisting almost entirely of GABA ρ1, with the 45 amino acid domain (comprising TM2, TM3, and the intervening short extracellular loop) provided by Gly-Rα1 (17Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M. Koltchine V.V. Finn S.E. Krasowski M.D. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar), expressed quite efficiently in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 3 B), and was gated by GABA with an EC50 of 1.3 μm and a Hill coefficient of 2.3 (Fig. 3 D). Again, although the TM2 domain was contributed entirely by Gly-Rα1, the kinetics of both activation and deactivation were extremely slow, strongly resembling the gating behavior of the wild-type GABA-Rρ1 (Fig. 3 D). The regulation of these chimeric receptors by alcohols was examined in detail and compared with those of the corresponding wild-type receptors. GABA ρ1 subunit function is inhibited by ethanol in Xenopus oocytes (22Mihic S.J. Harris R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 277: 411-416PubMed Google Scholar); in the present study, we expressed this subunit in HEK 293 cells and also observed concentration-dependent inhibition by both ethanol and butanol (Fig. 4 A). We then studied the chimera C6, in which GABA responses were potentiated by both ethanol and butanol (Fig. 4 B). The concentration-dependence and efficacy of these enhancing effects were similar to those exhibited by the wild-type Gly-Rα1 (cf.Fig. 2). Chimera C7 showed very weak inhibition of glycine currents by both ethanol and butanol (Fig. 4 C). The efficacy of these effects were smaller than those seen in the wild-type GABA ρ1 (cf. Fig. 4 A). These findings strongly confirmed and extended our original findings from experiments in Xenopus oocytes that suggested the pre-eminent importance of the TM2 and TM3 domains in the regulation of the Gly-R by alcohols (17Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M. Koltchine V.V. Finn S.E. Krasowski M.D. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). We next examined the effects of ethanol and butanol on the mutant S267I receptor in HEK 293 cells. The mutant S267I receptor expressed well in HEK cells, at levels comparable to those of the wild-type Gly-Rα1. Gating by glycine was efficient, with normal rapid activation and deactivation kinetics, an EC50 of 57 μm and a Hill coefficient of 2.2 (Fig. 5 A). Desensitization at high glycine concentrations appeared to be reduced in Gly-R(S267I) relative to wild-type Gly-Rα1. 2V. V. Koltchine, unpublished observations. In HEK 293 cells expressing the mutant Gly-Rα1(S267I) subunit, up to 200 mm ethanol had no effect on the response to submaximal glycine (Fig. 5 B, cf. Fig. 2 A); similar observations were made with 20 mm butanol (Fig. 5 C, cf. Fig. 2 B). Neither ethanol (100 mm) nor butanol (20 mm) had any significant effect on the concentration-response curve for glycine in the S267I mutant (Table I).Table IEC50 values and Hill coefficients for certain Gly-R Ser-267 mutantsGly-Rα1EC50 values (μm) and Hill coefficient (in parentheses)Control+ Ethanol (100 mm)+ Butanol (20 mm)Wild type83 (2.7)67 (2.1)41 (1.8)α1*(S267I)57 (2.2)57 (1.4)53 (1.7)α1*(S267H)251 (1.5)α1*(S267Y)226 (1.3) Open table in a new tab The results obtained with the S267I mutant strongly suggested an important role for Ser-267 in the regulation of Gly-Rα1 by alcohols. Because the side chain of isoleucine is larger and more hydrophobic than that of serine, we were curious to determine which amino acid residues at this position allowed for receptor function, and also to determine whether size, hydrophilicity or some other physical parameter of these residues dictated the abilities of the alcohols to potentiate Gly-Rα1 function. We therefore mutated Ser-267 to the remaining 18 amino acid residues commonly found in mammalian proteins. Due to the large number of mutants, we chose to express these in Xenopus oocytes, in which rapid sampling and screening of multiple constructs was facilitated by the use of a robotic system (23Mihic S.J. Harris R.A. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 802-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). A few selected mutants were also examined in HEK 293 cells. All of the mutant receptors expressed successfully in the oocytes. Replacement of Ser-267 with His also produced a functional Gly-R in HEK 293 cells, which was gated by glycine with an EC50 of 251 μm and a Hill coefficient of 1.5 (Table I). Replacement of Ser-267 with Tyr also produced a functional receptor gated by glycine, with an EC50 of 226 μm, Hill slope of 1.3 (Table I). Even the introduction of charged residues at position 267 produced functional Gly-R in Xenopus oocytes. We studied the regulation of each of these mutant receptors by ethanol in the Xenopus oocyte preparation. Each was tested by applying 200 mm ethanol and the results expressed in terms of potentiation of the response to a test concentration of glycine. In each case, we standardized the experiment by using an EC10concentration of glycine, i.e. a concentration of glycine that gave 10% of the maximal response obtained in that mutant receptor, the maximal response being usually assessed as the response to 10 mm glycine. Some mutant receptors demonstrated enhancement of glycine by ethanol; for example, the S267A and S267N mutants showed potentiation of glycine. Another group of mutants, including S267I and S267V, demonstrated almost no detectable effects of 200 mm ethanol. Unexpectedly, and perhaps most interestingly, another group of mutants, including S267Y, S267H, and S267F, showed quite strong inhibitory effects of ethanol. The results are summarized in the histogram in Fig. 6, in which the amino acids substituted at residue α267 are arranged in descending order of potentiation of Gly-R function by ethanol, from Ser-267, which gave the largest degree of potentiation, down to Tyr-267, which showed the largest degree of inhibition of Gly-R function by ethanol. To study further the nature of the hypothetical interaction between the alcohols and the amino acid residues at position 267 in Gly-Rα1, we investigated the relationship between some physical properties of the amino acid side chains and the alcohol response of the resultant mutant receptors. We found a significant inverse correlation between the extent of alcohol modulation and the volume of the amino acid side chain (Fig. 7), but no correlation between ethanol responsiveness and the polarity, hydrophobicity, or hydrophilicity of the amino acid residues. Earlier studies showed that ethanol and other alcohols enhance the action of agonist on homomeric Gly-R consisting only of α1 or α2 subunits (12Mascia M.P. Mihic S.J. Schofield P. Harris R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 402-406PubMed Google Scholar, 13Mascia M.P. Machu T.K. Harris R.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 1331-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), but inhibit the function of GABA-R composed of ρ1 subunits (22Mihic S.J. Harris R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 277: 411-416PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the question of whether these two opposite actions of alcohols are due to their actions on homologous regions of these two receptors, with different functional consequences, or whether they are due to drug interactions with distinct, non-conserved sequences. Our initial studies with chimeric and mutant receptors suggested that the 45-amino acid domain (comprising TM2, TM3, and the intervening short extracellular loop) accounted for both enhancing and inhibitory actions of the alcohols (17Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M. Koltchine V.V. Finn S.E. Krasowski M.D. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar), and this finding is confirmed and extended in the present study. The testing of “mini-chimeras” demonstrated that a 45-amino acid sequence in the Gly-Rα1 and GABA ρ1 subunits appears to be the prime determinant of both the enhancing and inhibitory actions of alcohols on this subfamily of receptors. One caveat here is that the alcohols do not show their full efficacy as inhibitory modulators at the C7 chimera, when compared with their effects on the wild-type GABA ρ1 receptor (Fig. 4), suggesting that for the inhibitory actions of the alcohols, there may well be an additional contribution to this effect from receptor structures outside TM2 and TM3. Another interesting issue with respect to the minichimeras is that the receptor gating kinetics are apparently not a property of TM2, since the 45 amino acid domain (comprising TM2, TM3, and the intervening short extracellular loop) from GABA-Rρ1 could be inserted into a Gly-R skeleton to create C7 without significantly slowing channel opening or closing, while the minichimera C6 retains the extremely slow gating behavior of the parent GABA ρ1 receptor (Fig. 3). These observations suggest that the rate-limiting steps for the opening of these channels might be in the binding of agonist, or might otherwise be controlled in other parts of the molecule not represented within TM2, TM3, or the TM2-TM3 loop. In our earlier study, we showed that mutation of Ser-267 to Ile abolished the action of ethanol (17Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M. Koltchine V.V. Finn S.E. Krasowski M.D. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar), and we therefore selected the Ser-267 residue for extensive mutagenesis. The resulting 19 mutant receptors with different amino acid residues at α267 showed a remarkable gradation of ethanol actions, ranging from 88% potentiation (Ser-267) to 55% inhibition (Tyr-267) of glycine-induced currents. The nature of this distribution (Fig. 6) suggested that a continuous property of the amino acids might determine the action of ethanol. Correlation analysis (Fig. 7) demonstrated that the molecular volume (24Zamytanin A.A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1972; 24: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) of the substituent at α267 was associated with more than 60% of the variation in ethanol activity among the mutant receptors. On the other hand, there was no relationship between ethanol action and hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, or charge (Fig. 7). These data suggest that the physical size of the residue at α267 is a key regulator of the effects of alcohols on the Gly-R. It is believed that Ser-270 in the GABAA-Rα1 subunit (a homolog of Ser-267 in Gly-Rα1) does not form part of the channel lining, but instead is likely to be sequestered within the interior of the protein (25Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Our observations on Ser-267 mutants are consistent with the idea that the binding of small molecules such as alcohols to the receptor protein could alter the subtle thermodynamic equilibria associated with channel gating in the Gly-R. However, it appears unlikely that Ser-267 itself is involved in the primary alcohol binding site, although this may be in the vicinity of residue 267. An obvious question to be considered here is how mutation of a single amino acid residue can alter the modulatory action of ethanol on Gly-R function so dramatically, from enhancement of receptor function (wild-type, S267G), through no effect (S267I, S267V), to inhibition (S267F, S267Y)? One possible explanation is based on the idea that, in the wild type glycine α1 receptor, ethanol preferentially binds to and thereby stabilizes the open state of the receptor; conversely, in the wild-type GABA ρ1 receptor, ethanol would bind to and stabilize the closed state of the receptor. Selective binding to active or inactive states of receptors has been proposed as the basis of the actions of agonists, antagonists, and “inverse agonists” on many types of receptors (26Leff P. Trends Physiol. Sci. 1995; 16: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Such an action of alcohols would be analogous to the preferential binding of local anesthetics to the inactivated state of the voltage-activated sodium channels (e.g. Refs. 27Strichartz G.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 62: 37-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar and 28Courtney K.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1975; 195: 225-236PubMed Google Scholar). According to such a model, a lack of detectable alcohol effect on a mutant Gly-R such as S267V would be explained by the drug binding with equal affinity to open and closed states, so that an equilibrium between enhancement and inhibition of receptor function is achieved. Applying this model to our data, the effect of mutations would be to change the relative affinity for ethanol binding to the open state of the receptor relative to the closed state, with the specific requirement that larger amino acid residues at 267 must favor the binding of ethanol to theclosed state. These mutants are thus inhibited by ethanol. Such a mechanism does not, of course, require that ethanol affect channel function by binding in the vicinity of Ser-267. Ser-267 may therefore act as a “transduction” site to determine the action of ethanol, which arises from a different binding site located elsewhere on the Gly-Rα1 polypeptide. Without detailed information on receptor structure (although molecular models have been proposed; see Ref. 29Gready J.E. Ranganathan S. Schofield P.R. Matsuo Y. Nishikawa K. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 983-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and in the absence of direct drug binding studies, it is difficult to distinguish between these two possibilities. In this respect, the lack of effect of long chain alcohols may be a useful tool. The so-called “cut-off” phenomenon is thought to be due to the exclusion of larger alcohols from an amphiphilic binding cavity or “pocket,” and the cut-off may serve as an indicator of the molecular size of such cavities within a given protein (30Li C. Peoples R.W. Weight F.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8200-8204Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 31Curry S. Moss G.W.J. Dickinson R. Lieb W.R. Franks N.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 102: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Studies of the Gly-R suggest a distinct cut-off at around dodecanol (13Mascia M.P. Machu T.K. Harris R.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 1331-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar); cut-off analysis on the chimeras and mutants studied here should help determine whether Ser-267 controls the size of such a binding pocket in Gly-R. In addition, single-channel kinetic studies of several of these mutant Gly-R would help to evaluate the hypothesis that ethanol preferentially stabilizes open or closed states of the channel operated by glycine. We are indebted to Prof. Heinrich Betz, Garry Cutting, and Peter Schofield, who supplied cDNAs used in this study, and to Dr. Gareth Tibbs for helpful discussion."

The significance of its insulin-stimulated increase at the cell surface and of its expression upon differentiation will require definitive delineation of its function. Insulin stimulates the transport of glucose in fat and muscle cells by causing the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 from an intracellular location to the plasma membrane (1Birnbaum M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137A: 239-297Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The basis for this effect is largely an enhancement of the rate constant for externalization of GLUT4 by insulin (2Satoh S. Nishimura H. Clark A.E. Kozka I.J. Vannuci S.J. Simpson I.A. Quon M.J. Cushman S.W. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17820-17829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Yang J. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4600-4603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular GLUT4 is most probably located in both endosomes and specialized insulin-regulatable secretory vesicles (4Martin S. Tellam J. Livingstone C. Gould G.W. James D.E. J.

The enhanced rate constant for externalization is likely to reflect in part or entirely the enhanced fusion of these insulin-regulatable vesicles with the plasma membrane (6Holman G.D. Lo Leggio L.

To search for other proteins that undergo translocation in response to insulin, we and others have undertaken the characterization of other proteins in the intracellular vesicles containing GLUT4 (8Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 271: E1-E14Google Scholar). This approach led to the discovery of a novel membrane aminopeptidase, now referred to as the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) 1The abbreviations used are: IRAP, insulin-regulated aminopeptidase; CIM6PR, cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor; LDM, low density microsomes; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends.

IRAP is entirely colocalized with GLUT4 in adipocytes and, like GLUT4, undergoes marked translocation in response to insulin (5Malide D. St.-Denis J.-F. Keller S.R. Cushman S.W.

In the present study we have partially cloned and then characterized another major novel protein of 110 kDa present in the GLUT4-containing intracellular vesicles from rat adipocytes. While this work was in progress, the homologous human protein was cloned in another context and named sortilin (13Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjaer A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3599-3605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The function of sortilin has not been established. However, the fact that it has a cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal sequence highly homologous to that of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CIM6PR) and a lumenal domain homologous to the yeast vacuolar sorting protein 10, together with the finding that it appears to be colocalized with the CIM6PR in COS cells, suggest that sortilin is a receptor involved in sorting lumenal proteins from the trans-Golgi to late endosomes (13Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjaer A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol.

Here we show that in adipocytes sortilin is largely located in vesicles containing GLUT4 and that in response to insulin sortilin translocates to the plasma membrane, although not as markedly as does GLUT4 or IRAP. A rabbit antiserum was raised against the entire lumenal domain of human sortilin expressed as a recombinant protein, and the immunoglobulin fraction was isolated from the serum. The details of this preparation will be described elsewhere. 2S. K. Moestrup and C. M. Petersen, unpublished data. A rabbit antiserum was generated against the carboxyl-terminal peptide of rat sortilin (terminal 14 amino acids with Cys at the amino terminus of the peptide) conjugated via the Cys to keyhole limpet hemocyanin.

Two additional human expressed sequence tags (H85459 and N71981) contained overlapping sequences. This information was used to design two sense primers based on the first peptide (CGGCNGAGGACCARGA (a), where N = A, T, G, or C and R = A or G, and CGGGACTTCGTCGCCAAG (b)) and an antisense primer based on the second peptide (TTCCCATAATCCTCACTTCGATA (c)).

According to this method, vesicles were adsorbed from the LDM/cytosol fraction of rat or 3T3-L1 adipocytes with antibodies against the carboxyl-terminal peptide of GLUT4 bound to protein A on the surface of Staph A cells. In the case of rat adipocytes, approximately 1.3 ml of this fraction, which was derived from the adipocytes from one rat (about 5 × 106cells), was adsorbed with 7.5 μg of antibodies on 2.5 μl of Staph A cells.

GLUT4 vesicles isolated from the LDM of rat adipocytes contained a 110-kDa protein (Fig. 1, lane 2). A large scale preparation of the GLUT4 vesicles was carried out, and a sufficient amount of the 110-kDa protein was isolated so that the sequences of four LysC peptides could be obtained (underlined in Fig. 2). Homologs of two peptides (amino acids 1–16 and 65–73) were found to be encoded in a single human expressed sequence tag, and this information allowed the amplification of the intervening sequence from a rat adipocyte cDNA library by PCR. Additional cDNA sequences were obtained by the 3′ RACE procedure with the rat adipocyte cDNA library. After approximately 2400 base pairs of cDNA had been obtained, the sequence of human sortilin appeared in the data base, and it was evident that the 110-kDa protein was rat sortilin. Fig. 2presents the nucleotide and amino acid sequences for the carboxyl-terminal 748 amino acids of rat sortilin. Over this region the amino acid sequence is 92% identical to that of human sortilin (Fig. 2). Human sortilin is predicted to have a single membrane-spanning domain near its carboxyl terminus (13Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjaer A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3599-3605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar); rat sortilin has the identical sequence (boxed in Fig. 2). Unprocessed human sortilin is a protein of 833 amino acids (13Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjaer A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3599-3605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), and presumably the rat protein is approximately the same size. The cDNA that we cloned is missing the region encoding the amino terminus (Fig. 2). We decided not to complete the cloning of the rat protein for two reasons. First, our main aim was to identify the 110-kDa protein, and with the publication of the sequence of human sortilin this was achieved. Second, our repeated attempts to amplify the 5′ end of the cDNA by the 5′ RACE method were unsuccessful; this region of the human cDNA is highly G/C-rich (13Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjaer A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3599-3605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), and most probably this fact accounts for the failure of the 5′ RACE. Further evidence that the 110-kDa protein is sortilin is presented in Fig. 1 (lane 3). Antibodies against sortilin specifically reacted with this protein. The discovery of sortilin in GLUT4 vesicles led us to compare the subcellular distribution of sortilin with that of GLUT4 and IRAP. Subcellular fractions from basal and insulin-treated rat and 3T3-L1 adipocytes were analyzed for sortilin, GLUT4, and IRAP by immunoblotting (Fig. 3). The subcellular distribution of sortilin in the fractions from basal cells closely resembled that of GLUT4 and IRAP; each protein was mainly concentrated in the LDM fraction, with a lesser amount in the high density microsomes. As expected, upon insulin treatment the amounts of GLUT4 and IRAP in the plasma membranes increased by 6.2 ± 1.2- and 2.2 ± 0.6-fold, respectively, for the rat adipocytes and by 13 ± 6.8- and 5.1 ± 2.8-fold, respectively, for the 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 3, lane 6 versus lane 5 and lane 18 versus lane 17). Correspondingly, the amounts of GLUT4 and IRAP in the LDM decreased to 58 ± 12 and 69 ± 22% of the level in basal cells, respectively, for rat adipocytes and to 50 and 45% of the level in basal cells, respectively, for 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 3, lane 4 versus lane 3 and lane 16 versus lane 15). In contrast, sortilin showed a small increase or no increase in the plasma membrane (1.0 ± 0.2- and 1.7 ± 0.5-fold for rat and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, respectively) and a small decrease or no decrease in the LDM (110 ± 7 and 90% of the level in basal rat and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, respectively) (Fig. 3, lanes given above). To determine what fraction of the sortilin in the LDM was located in vesicles containing GLUT4, the vesicles were isolated from the LDM with antibodies against the carboxyl terminus of GLUT4; then the original LDM, the depleted LDM, and the vesicles were analyzed for sortilin, as well as for GLUT4 and IRAP, by immunoblotting (Fig. 4). With the LDM from rat and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, 90 ± 2 and 87 ± 6% of the GLUT4 vesicles, respectively, were specifically adsorbed by the antibodies against GLUT4, as measured by the percentage of depletion of both GLUT4 and IRAP from the LDM 3The values for the percentages of GLUT4 and IRAP in the vesicles have been combined, because they were the same for both proteins within experimental error. (Fig. 4, lane 6 versus 5 and lane 17 versus lane 16) and evidenced by the recovery of the IRAP in the vesicles (lanes 8 and 19). A substantial portion of the sortilin, 75 ± 7 and 70 ± 0% in rat and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, respectively, was located in the adsorbed GLUT4 vesicles, measured by its depletion from the LDM and shown by its recovery in the vesicle proteins (Fig. 4, lanes as given above). As described above, analysis by subcellular fractionation revealed little or no translocation of sortilin to the plasma membrane in response to insulin in either rat or 3T3-L1 adipocytes. However, this method can underestimate the degree of translocation, because some intracellular vesicles often contaminate the plasma membranes. In fact, on the basis of a previous report (24Kandror K. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 138-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we expected some translocation of sortilin in response to insulin. It had been found that GLUT4 vesicles contain a 110-kDa protein that could be biotinylated by treating rat adipocytes with a membrane-impermeant biotinylating reagent and that the biotinylation of this protein was greater when the adipocytes were in the insulin-treated state. This result was interpreted to mean that more of the 110-kDa protein was at the cell surface subsequent to insulin treatment. Most likely this 110-kDa protein was sortilin. To quantitate the translocation of sortilin, we employed a cell surface biotinylation method that we have previously developed to measure the translocation of IRAP in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (11Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Morris N.J. Leung W.-Y. Mao F. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3328-3332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Basal and insulin-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were cooled to 4 °C to prevent membrane trafficking and then reacted with a membrane-impermeant reagent that biotinylates amino groups. Subsequently, sortilin and, as a control, IRAP were isolated by immunoprecipitation with antibodies against their cytoplasmic domains, and the biotin content of each measured by blotting with streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The biotin content of the sortilin or IRAP from insulin-treated cells relative to that of the protein from basal cells measures the fold increase at the cell surface. Fig. 5 presents the results of a typical experiment. Insulin increased the amount of sortilin at the plasma membrane by 1.7 ± 0.2-fold (lane 2 versus lane 1). By contrast and in agreement with our previous results (11Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Morris N.J. Leung W.-Y. Mao F. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3328-3332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), the amount of IRAP at the cell surface increased by more than 8-fold (lane 9 versus lane 8). The translocation of sortilin and GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was also examined by immunofluorescence (see “Experimental Procedures”). In basal cells the labeling pattern for both proteins consisted of a strong perinuclear patch and dots throughout the cell, as described previously for GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (11Ross S.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26000-26005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and sortilin in COS cells (13Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjaer A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3599-3605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Upon insulin treatment, a ring of GLUT4 fluorescence at the periphery of the cell, which reflects GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane, was evident (as in Ref. 25Herbst J.J. Andrews G.C. Contillo L.G. Singleton D.H. Genereux P.E. Gibbs E.M. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26000-26005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, no such ring was exhibited by sortilin (data not shown). This qualitative result thus agrees with the conclusion from subcellular fractionation and cell surface biotinylation that marked translocation of sortilin does not occur. Fig. 6 shows the expression of sortilin as 3T3-L1 fibroblasts differentiate into adipocytes. There was no detectable expression in the fibroblasts; expression was first evident at day 4 of differentiation and maximal by day 8. This pattern is almost the same as that for GLUT4 expression (Fig. 6 and Ref. 11Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Morris N.J. Leung W.-Y. Mao F. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3328-3332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast, IRAP is expressed in fibroblasts, although at about one-sixth the amount per mg of protein as in adipocytes (Fig. 6 and Ref. 11Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Morris N.J. Leung W.-Y. Mao F. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3328-3332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, like GLUT4, sortilin is a marker for adipocyte differentiation. This study shows that sortilin is the major protein of 110 kDa in the GLUT4 vesicles isolated from adipocytes. This finding led us to expect that sortilin would undergo translocation to the plasma membrane in response to insulin. In fact, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, where translocation was accurately measured by cell surface biotinylation, insulin caused a modest (1.7-fold) increase in sortilin at the plasma membrane. In this regard, sortilin is similar to the transferrin receptor, the CIM6PR, and the α2 macroglobulin receptor. Each of these has been found to increase from 2- to 4-fold at the cell surface of 3T3-L1 adipocytes in response to insulin (26Tanner L.I. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8975-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Tanner L.I. Lienhard G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1537-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Corvera S. Graver D.F. Smith R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10133-10138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the modest insulin-elicited translocation of these receptors, GLUT4 and IRAP show larger responses (approximately 14- and 8-fold increases at the plasma membrane in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in response to insulin, respectively) (11Ross S.A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 10393-10399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The response of GLUT1 (6-fold) is intermediate (15Calderhead D.M. Kitagawa K. Tanner L.I. Holman G.D. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13801-13808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Yang J. Clark A.E. Kozka I.J. Cushman S.W. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10393-10399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One hypothesis to account for these differences in the fold effects, which is based on current information and models in the literature, is as follows. Sortilin and the other receptors are at least partially located in the endosomal compartment. Insulin causes a 2-fold increase in the rate constant for trafficking from the endosomes to the plasma membrane. This increase results in a corresponding increase of this magnitude in the amounts of each of sortilin and the other receptors at the cell surface. In support of this hypothesis, the rate constant for externalization of the transferrin receptor in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is increased 2-fold by insulin (26Tanner L.I. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8975-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and kinetic analysis shows that this increase accounts for its redistribution in response to insulin (26Tanner L.I. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8975-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, GLUT4 and IRAP are located in both the endosomes and in the specialized insulin-regulatable vesicles, which are postulated to arise from the endosomes (6Holman G.D. Lo Leggio L. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17516-17524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Verhey K.J. Yeh J.-I. Birnbaum M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). GLUT4 and IRAP are sequestered in these vesicles in the unstimulated adipocytes, and consequently the amounts of each on the cell surface are low in this state. Insulin causes a large increase in the rate constant for exocytosis of the specialized vesicles, and as a consequence the fold increases in GLUT4 and IRAP at the plasma membrane are much larger (6Holman G.D. Lo Leggio L. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17516-17524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Verhey K.J. Yeh J.-I. Birnbaum M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The finding that a large fraction of the sortilin is isolated in the GLUT4 vesicles may at first seem inconsistent with the modest translocation of sortilin. The explanation probably lies in the nature of the GLUT4 vesicles. The GLUT4 vesicles are operationally defined as those vesicles that are isolated from the LDM fraction with antibodies against GLUT4. The LDM fraction contains not only the specialized insulin-regulatable vesicles, but also vesicles arising from the endosomes, Golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum, and there are also surely GLUT4 molecules in some of these latter vesicles. Because our procedure for the isolation of GLUT4 vesicles probably adsorbs any vesicle with one copy of GLUT4, most of the sortilin may be in GLUT4 vesicles arising from endosomes and Golgi, whereas much more of the GLUT4 and IRAP may be in the specialized insulin-regulatable vesicles. The function of sortilin remains to be determined. Although its known properties suggest that it may be a receptor for sorting lumenal proteins from the Golgi to the late endosomes, similar to the CIM6PR (see the Introduction), it could also be a receptor for a specific extracellular ligand. For example, the CIM6PR is also the receptor for insulin-like growth factor II (30Roth R.A. Science. 1988; 239: 1269-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). If sortilin is a receptor for an extracellular ligand, then the insulin-elicited increase at the plasma membrane should lead to a corresponding increase in endocytosis of this ligand and consequently would be of physiological significance. The finding that fibroblasts have no detectable sortilin suggests that whatever its function, sortilin is not required for viability of all animal cell types. We are indebted to Renee Robinson, John Neveu, and Terri Addona for expertise in the HPLC, peptide sequencing, and mass spectrometry, respectively, to Dr. Cynthia Mastick for preparing subcellular fractions of rat adipocytes, to Dr. Susan Frost for providing the method for subcellular fractionation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes before its publication, and to Drs. Konstantin Kandror and Paul Pilch for informing us of the investigation of sortilin in rat adipocytes."

The hallmark properties of PrPSc are its insolubility in nondenaturing detergents and its resistance to digestion by proteases. Anions such as Congo red (CR) have been shown to reduce the accumulation of PrPSc in a neuroblastoma cell line permanently infected with prions as well as to delay disease onset in rodents when administrated prophylactically. The mechanism by which such anti-prion agents operate is unknown. We show here that in vitro incubation with CR renders native PrPScresistant to denaturation by boiling SDS. This resulted from PrPSc conformation, since neither the properties of PrPC nor those of predenatured PrPSc were changed by the addition of CR. CR-PrPSc could only be denatured by the addition of acidic 3 m guanidine thiocyanate. Since in vitro conversion experiments have suggested that partial denaturation may be required for PrPSc to serve as template in the PrPC → PrPSc conversion, we propose that CR inhibits prion propagation by overstabilizing the conformation of PrPScmolecules.

Prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans or scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathies in animals, are fatal transmissible neurodegenerative diseases (1Prusiner S.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 207: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar). The only component of the prion is PrPSc, an abnormal conformer of the host encoded PrPC. Both PrP isoforms share the same amino acid sequence, but, as opposed to PrPC, PrPSc is relatively resistant to digestion by proteases and insoluble in nondenaturing detergents (2Baldwin M.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19197-19200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Unlike PrPC, which is mainly α-helical, PrPSc contains a considerable amount of β-sheet structures (3Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S.

The cell biology of prion diseases as well as the metabolism of the prion protein isoforms, have been investigated extensively in scrapie-infected mouse neuroblastoma cells (ScN2a) (9Borchelt D.R. Scott M. Taraboulos A. Stahl N. Prusiner S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 10Taraboulos A. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2117-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These cells are permanently infected with prions and produce both PrPScand PrPC. In addition, inoculation of ScN2a extracts into mice causes prion disease (11Butler D.A. Scott M.R. Bockman J.M. Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Hsiao K.K. Kingsbury D.T. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been postulated that prion diseases propagate by the conversion of α-helical PrPCmolecules into β-sheet enriched PrPSc by a mechanism in which PrPSc serves as a template (12Nguyen J.

Biol. 1997; 7: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Such a pathway may feature either the formation of PrPC-PrPScheterodimers alone or be also aided by mediator molecules. Experiments with transgenic mice favor the presence of such mediators and predict some of them to be species-specific (15Telling G.C. Scott M. Mastrianni J. Gabizon R. Torchia M. Cohen F.E.

While there is currently no effective therapy for prion diseases, an impressive body of data indicates that polyanions in general, and sulfated sugars in particular, inhibit prion propagation both in animals and in cultured cells. An array of such reagents have been utilized in an effort to “cure” prion infection, either in ScN2a cells or in animal models (16Caughey B. Phil. Trans R. Soc. Lond.-Biol.

The criteria for the “cure” of ScN2a cells are reduction of cell infectivity titers and decrease of PrPSc levels produced by the cells. Several anti-prion agents, such as Congo red (CR), 1The abbreviations used are: CR, Congo red; PK, proteinase K; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GndSCN, guanidine thiocyanate; DLPC, detergent-lipid protein complexes. pentosan polysulfate, and others, fulfill these criteria (20Priola S.A. Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Chesebro B. Infect. Agents Dis. 1994; 3: 54-58PubMed Google Scholar). In rodents, coinoculation of prion samples with CR (21Ingrosso L. Ladogana A. Pocchiari M. J.

The mechanism by which these anti-prion agents operate has not been elucidated, although it can be assumed that they must interfere with one or more of the steps leading to the completion of the PrPC → PrPSc conversion. Diverse sulfated polyanions seem to interfere with the subcellular metabolism of prions in the host cell, for example by altering the recycling of PrP to the interior of the cell (20Priola S.A. Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Chesebro B. Infect. Agents Dis. 1994; 3: 54-58PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, none of these reagents were shown to inhibit PrPC production (23Caughey B. Race R.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 724: 290-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Some of them, such as CR, pentosan polysulfate, or low molecular weight heparin, were shown to inhibit the binding of PrP to heparin (17Gabizon R. Meiner Z. Halimi M. Ben Sasson S.A. J.

The fluorescent antracycline iododoxorubicin was also shown to decorate amyloid deposits in brain sections of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease patients (19Tagliavini F. McArthur R.A. Canciani G. Giaccone G. Porro M. Bugiani M. Lievens P.M.-J. Bugiani O. Peri E. Dall'Ara P. Rocchi M. Poli G. Forloni G. Bandiera T. Varasi M. Suarato A. Passuti P. Cervini M.A. Lansen J. Salmona M. Post C. Science. 1997; 276: 1119-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that some of these reagents interact directly with the prion proteins in the inoculum. In this work, we investigated whether CR inhibition of prion propagation may result from direct interaction of CR with PrPSc. The activity of CR as an anti-prion agent is particularly interesting, since this reagent is used as an amyloid dye in many systems including prion diseases (26Tashima T. Kitamoto T. Tateishi J. Sato Y. Brain Res. 1986; 399: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In fact, its binding to protein aggregates is considered diagnostic of an amyloidogenic process (27Wille H. Zhang G.F. Baldwin M.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 608-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Our results show that such an interaction of CR with the prion isoform exists and results in overstabilization of the PrPSc molecules, as can be seen by their increased resistance to denaturation. If so, CR inhibition of prion propagation may result form the inability of CR-PrPSc to convert into the partially denatured molecules required as template in the PrPC → PrPSc reaction.

Dis. 1986; 154: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) were used for immunoblotting. Antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:3000 or 1:1000, respectively (of the serum or the ascitic fluid). ScN2a-c10 cells are scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells that express the MHM2-PrP chimeric gene (30Scott M.R. Kohler R. Foster D. Prusiner S.B. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 986-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) driven by the commercial expression vector pCI-neo (Promega). The cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 mg/ml G418. Identically seeded and confluent ScN2a-c10 cells were cultured in 10-cm plates (about 107 cells) and incubated for 16, 24, or 48 h in the presence of either 50 μg/ml CR, 1.5 μg/ml tunicamycin, or both. Cells were extracted in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40. The samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was concentrated by methanol precipitation and digested with 40 μg/ml proteinase K (PK) for 20 min at 37 °C. 3m acidic GndSCN was added to half of each sample before boiling in SDS sample buffer and immunoblotting with anti-PrP Ab 3F4. Normal and scrapie-infected Syrian hamster brains were kindly provided by Dr. S. B. Prusiner from the University of California, San Francisco. Membranes were prepared as follows. One brain (1 g) was homogenized in 10 ml of cold sucrose buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was subsequently supplemented with 40 ml of sucrose buffer and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in with 40 ml of cold 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and centrifuged again at 20,000 rpm for 30 min. The final pellet was resuspended to a concentration of 5 mg/ml in STES buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2% sarkosyl). Normal and scrapie-infected hamster brain membranes were incubated with increasing concentrations of CR for 1 h at room temperature. Scrapie samples were digested with 40 μg/ml PK for 20 min at 37 °C, and all samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer before immunoblotting with mAb 3F4. The percentage of acrylamide for SDS-PAGE (10% for the scrapie samples or 12% for the normal samples) was determined to avoid comigration of the PrP band with the dye. Syrian hamster prion rods (PrP-(27–30)) purified by the sucrose gradient method (32Prusiner S.B. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Bolton D.C. Bendheim P.E. Groth D.F. Glenner G.G. Cell. 1983; 35: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. S. B. Prusiner. PrP-(27–30) was diluted to a final concentration of approximately 100 ng/ml in STES buffer and incubated with increasing concentrations of CR for 1 h at room temperature. Half of each sample was then incubated with 3m guanidine thiocyanate, pH 2.5, for 10 min and concentrated by methanol precipitation prior to SDS-PAGE analysis and immunoblotting with mAb 3F4. Purified PrP-(27–30) was incubated in the presence or absence of 200 μg/ml CR for 1 h at room temperature. After the incubation, the samples were boiled in 1% SDS and then diluted 10-fold with STES buffer. Samples were digested with 20 μg/ml PK for 30 min at 37 °C and treated with or without 3 m acidic GndSCN as described above. Purified PrP-(27–30) was resuspended in Hepes buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes sodium salt, pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml and incubated, when applicable, with 200 μg/ml CR for 1 h at room temperature. Prion rods were dispersed into DLPC as described by Gabizon et al. (33Gabizon R. McKinley M.P. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4017-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Shortly, the resuspended rods were mixed with 2% sodium cholate and added to a glass tube containing dried α-l-phosphatidylcholine (10 mg). The sample was mixed, sonicated, and centrifuged at 31,000 × g for 25 min. Pellet and supernatant were separated, supplemented with 3m acidic GndSCN, and methanol-precipitated. For some experiments, the supernatant, which contained PrP-(27–30) in DLPC, was incubated in the presence of 200 μg/ml CR for 1 h at room temperature followed by the addition of 3 m acidic GndSCN before methanol precipitation. All samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer before immunoblotting with mAb 3F4. 150 ng/ml of purified PrP-(27–30) in DLPC were incubated in the absence or presence of 200 μg/ml CR for 1 h at room temperature and immunoprecipitated with mAb 3F4 (diluted 1:250) for 18 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was then added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature. The beads were rinsed five times in TNS (100 mm NaCl, 1% sarkosyl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and were separated from the supernatant. Supernatant and beads were treated in the presence or absence of 3 m acidic GndSCN followed by methanol precipitation. All samples were boiled in sample buffer, which did not contain β-mercaptoethanol, and immunoblotted with antiserum RO73. To investigate whether direct interaction of PrPSc with CR may result in inhibition of prion propagation, we tested the biochemical properties of the PrP proteins after incubation of membranes from normal or scrapie-infected hamster brains with CR. The hallmark property of PrPSc is its protease resistance. While PrPC is highly sensitive to proteases, digestion of PrPSc with PK results in PrP-(27–30), the protease-resistant core of PrPSc (34Oesch B. Westaway D. Walchli M. McKinley M.P. Kent S.B. Aebersold R. Barry R.A. Tempst P. Teplow D.B. Hood L.E. Prusiner S.B. Weissmann C. Cell. 1985; 40: 735-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). To test whether incubation of PrPSc with CR will render this protein sensitive to PK, normal and scrapie brain samples were incubated with increasing concentrations of CR. Scrapie-infected hamster samples presumably contain both PrP isoforms, as opposed to normal brain membranes that contained only PrPC (35Meyer R.K. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Braunfeld M.B. Barry R.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2310-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). To differentiate the protease-sensitive PrPC from protease-resistant PrPSc, the scrapie-infected brain samples (CR-treated and controls) were digested with PK (see “Experimental Procedures”) prior to PAGE analysis. All samples were subsequently boiled in SDS sample buffer and processed for immunoblotting. While the PrPC pattern on the gel carrying only normal brain samples was not affected by the preincubation with CR (Fig. 1 A), the presence of PrP-(27–30) on the immunoblot loaded with samples from scrapie-infected brains was reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). These results suggested the intriguing possibility that direct incubation of the scrapie isoform with CRin vitro is enough to render PrPSc sensitive to digestion by proteases. This attractive possibility, however, was discarded after the same experiments were repeated with purified PrP-(27–30). Purified PrP-(27–30) was incubated with CR (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) and subsequently boiled in SDS sample buffer before immunoblotting (Fig. 2 A). As membranal PrPSc in Fig. 1, PrP-(27–30) was not apparent in the lanes loaded with CR-treated samples. The absence of CR-treated PrP-(27–30) from the immunoblot was obviously not a result of acquired protease sensitivity of the scrapie protein, since in this case, the samples were digested with PK during the PrP purification protocol (32Prusiner S.B. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Bolton D.C. Bendheim P.E. Groth D.F. Glenner G.G. Cell. 1983; 35: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) and not after the incubation in the presence of CR. Nor were these results due to loss of PrP immunoreactivity, since CR-treated PrP-(27–30) could not be visualized even when the samples were applied to a silver-stained SDS gel (Fig. 3 C). The effect of CR on the scrapie PrP isoforms most probably resulted from the specific scrapie conformation of the PrP protein. This could be concluded from the fact that PrP-(27–30) could be visualized by immunoblotting if it was denatured either by boiling in SDS (Fig. 3 B) or by the addition of 3 m guanidine thiocyanate (GdnSCN) (Fig. 3 A), prior to but not after the addition of CR.Figure 3CR does not affect the properties of predenatured PrPSc. A, purified PrP-(27–30) was incubated in the presence or absence of 3 m GdnSCN followed by methanol precipitation. The precipitated samples were treated with and without CR as described in Fig. 2 B (500 μg/ml CR) and subsequently immunoblotted with mAb 3F4. B, PrP-(27–30) was boiled in the presence of SDS for 5 min and subsequently diluted before incubation in the presence of 0, 100, or 500 μg/ml CR. All samples were immunoblotted with mAb 3F4. C, PrP-(27–30) was incubated in the presence and absence of 200 μg/ml CR and applied to SDS-PAGE after boiling in SDS sample buffer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) CR-treated PrP-(27–30) rods (Fig. 2 A, +) and membranal CR-treated PrPSc (Fig. 2 C) could be denatured and subsequently visualized on an immunoblot, albeit only when 3m acidic GndSCN was added to the samples prior to their boiling in SDS sample buffer. These results suggest that, as opposed to our first erroneous conclusion that implied CR renders PrPSc protease-sensitive, in fact, CR-treated PrPSc as well as CR-treated PrP-(27–30) are substantially more difficult to denature than control PrPSc samples. This increased resistance to denaturation hinders the entrance of the scrapie protein into the gel, even after boiling in the presence of SDS. After denaturation, PrP-(27–30) resistance to protease digestion is known to be abolished (36Prusiner S.B. Groth D. Serban A. Stahl N. Gabizon R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2793-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To investigate whether CR indeed inhibits PrPSc denaturation, we tested the protease resistance of SDS-boiled CR-PrP-(27–30) as compared with SDS-boiled PrP-(27–30) untreated with CR (Fig. 2 B). CR-treated PrP-(27–30) was boiled in 1% SDS for 10 min and subsequently digested with 20 μg/ml PK at 37 °C for 30 min after a 10-fold dilution of the SDS. As opposed to untreated PrP-(27–30), which was converted into protease-sensitive form by boiling SDS, CR-treated PrP-(27–30) was resistant to PK digestion even at these conditions, reinforcing the conclusion that CR renders PrP-(27–30) resistant to denaturation by established procedures such as boiling in the presence of SDS (Fig. 2 B, −). That CR does not inhibit the activity of PK can be inferred from Fig. 1, since PrPSc was completely digested to PrP-(27–30) in the presence of high CR concentrations. As in Fig. 2 A, the presence of the scrapie protein on the gel could be detected only after acidic GndSCN was added to the sample buffer (Fig. 2 B, +). Interestingly, acidic GdnSCN revealed some PK-resistant PrP-(27–30) also in the SDS-boiled control samples, suggesting that PrP-(27–30) rods comprise a core of very stable PrP-(27–30) even before the addition of CR. In addition to protease resistance, another hallmark property of the scrapie prion protein is its insolubility in nondenaturing detergents (Fig. 4 A). The insolubility of PrPSc has been utilized in the protocol developed for its purification as PrP-(27–30) rods (37Prusiner S.B. Bolton D.C. Groth D.F. Bowman K.A. Cochran S.P. McKinley M.P. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6942-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Interestingly, as opposed to its behavior in many detergents, the insoluble rods could be dispersed into DLPC (33Gabizon R. McKinley M.P. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4017-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). When PrP-(27–30) in prion rods was sonicated in the presence of phosphatidylcholine and 2% cholate and subsequently centrifuged at high speed, most of the PrP remained in the supernatant, as opposed to the samples without lipids, which are pelleted at these conditions (Fig. 4 B). Although it is difficult to conclude whether PrP-(27–30) is completely solubilized to monomers by this procedure, it is obviously more dispersed than in rods and, as a result of this, more infectious (38Gabizon R. McKinley M.P. Groth D.F. Kenaga L. Prusiner S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4950-4955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether CR competes with lipids for binding sites on PrPSc, we tested whether CR-PrP-(27–30) could also be incorporated into DLPC. As can be seen in Fig. 4 B, when CR-treated PrP-(27–30) was dispersed into DLPC by the same protocol used for control PrP, most of the CR-treated protein remained in the supernatant. As in the previous experiments, this could be visualized only after the addition of acidic GndSCN to the samples prior to their analysis by PAGE (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, PrP-(27–30) in DLPC was still susceptible to CR, since acidic GdnSCN was required to visualized on the immunoblot PrP-(27–30) to which CR was applied after the dispersion into DLPC (Fig. 4 C). This result suggests that dispersion into DLPC did not hide the CR binding site of PrP-(27–30). To test whether the CR addition to PrP in DLPC results in reaggregation of the protein, we recentrifuged the samples after the addition of CR to previously dispersed PrP-(27–30) (Fig. 4 D). PrP-(27–30) remained in the supernatant after an additional high speed centrifugation. Again, the prion protein could be visualized only after the addition of acidic GdnSCN to the sample buffer. Dispersion of native PrPSc or PrP-(27–30) into DLPC significantly increased their otherwise very poor affinity for PrP antibodies (28Serban D. Taraboulos A. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Neurology. 1990; 40: 110-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Gabizon R. McKinley M.P. Groth D. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6617-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To test the effect of CR on this antibody affinity, PrP-(27–30) in DLPC as well as CR-treated PrP-(27–30) in DLPC were incubated with either mAb 3F4 or mAb 13A5 (29Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Barry R.A. Prusiner S.B. J. Infect. Dis. 1986; 154: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) followed by precipitation of the immunocomplexes with protein A-Sepharose (Fig. 5). Acidic GndSCN was added to the samples prior to boiling in SDS sample. All samples were thereafter immunoblotted with polyclonal PrP antiserum RO73 (28Serban D. Taraboulos A. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Neurology. 1990; 40: 110-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While a significant fraction of PrP-(27–30) in DLPC was immunoprecipitated by either of the α-PrP mAbs, almost no PrP was present in the pellet of the CR-PrP sample. These results are consistent with the possibility that CR may stabilize the PrPSc configuration in such a way that its binding to other cell components, or even to its own antibodies, is now inhibited. The best cell culture model developed to date for prion infection is the ScN2a system. These scrapie-infected mouse neuroblastoma cells produce PrPSc as well as infectivity (11Butler D.A. Scott M.R. Bockman J.M. Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Hsiao K.K. Kingsbury D.T. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Caughey B. Race R.E. Ernst D. Buchmeier M.J. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 175-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When ScN2a cells were cultured in the presence of CR, no new PrPSc was synthesized and subsequently accumulated (41Caughey B. Ernst D. Race R.E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6270-6272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the fate of PrPScin these cells to resolve whether in previous experiments some of the “old” scrapie protein may not have been accounted for because of the insufficient denaturation that results from the addition of CR. ScN2a-c10 cells, a ScN2a clone expressing a chimeric mouse/hamster PrP (47Lasmezas C.I. Deslys J.P. Robain O. Jaegly A. Beringue V. Peyrin J.M. Fournier J.G. Hauw J.J. Rossier J. Dormont D. Science. 1997; 275: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), were incubated with and without CR and in the presence or absence of tunicamycin, a glycosylation inhibitor, for 18, 30, or 48 h. Cell lysates were then digested with 20 μg/ml PK for 30 min at 37 °C. In the presence of tunicamycin, new PrP is synthesized as an unglycosylated protease-resistant protein (42Taraboulos A. Rogers M. Borchelt D.R. McKinley M.P. Scott M. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8262-8266Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), while fully glycosylated PrPSc, higher in M r, present prior to the addition of tunicamycin is degraded very slowly. Such an experiment is shown in Fig. 6. In the absence of CR, fully glycosylated “old” PrP (upper band of the three that comprise the PrP immunoblot profile) was partially degraded after 48 h in tunicamycin, while the lower band signal (representing unglycosylated PrP) was considerably enhanced as compared with the signal obtained before the addition of tunicamycin. When tunicamycin was added to the cells incubated in the presence of CR, no new protease-resistant PrP was synthesized, as seen by the fact that there was no increase in the signal of the low molecular weight band. In effect, no difference at all could be appreciated in the banding pattern of PK-resistant PrP in the presence or absence of tunicamycin. These results suggest that no new PrPSc was made by ScN2a-c10 cells in the presence of CR, although the concentration of the old PrPSc remained high. As with the previous experiments performed on membranes or purified PrP-(27–30), the total concentration of PrPSc in the CR-treated cells could be visualized only when acidic GndSCN was added to the denaturing sample buffer. Prions appear to propagate by refolding mature PrPC, a membrane glycoprotein of unknown function, into an isoform of aberrant conformation denominated PrPSc. This refolded protein is the only known component of the prion. Thus, the two isoforms of PrP serve, at the same time, as substrate and template in the conversion process that results in the accumulation of more prions. During the conversion, PrPSc somehow confers to PrPC its own and distinct structural conformation, which is extremely stable and comprises large β-sheet segments (5Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). Although the very nature of the conversion process is unknown, in vitro studies have suggested that partial denaturation of PrPSc may be a crucial requirement for this molecule to act as a template in the further conformational conversion of PrPC (43Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). In addition, theoretical considerations also suggested the involvement of a partially denatured molten globule in the formation of PrPSc (44Safar J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 207: 69-76PubMed Google Scholar). The requirement of the chaperon HSP104 for the propagation of the prion like Ψ of yeast also suggested that template “breathing” may feature in the propagation of conformers (45Lindquist S. Patino M.M. Chernoff Y.O. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Liebman S.W. Lee K.H. Blake T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that reagents that stabilize PrPSc so that it cannot be partially denatured will inhibit prion propagation. Our results show that CR can act directly on PrPSc, evenin vitro, and that its effect can be evaluated in a simple assay. Since reagents such as CR inhibit further propagation of prions, they must interfere with one or more steps in the conversion process. While other anti-prion agents may disrupt the PrPScconformation and render this protein protease-sensitive, as expected from an anti-prion agent, CR seems to reinforce PrPScstructure and, as a result of this, inhibit its denaturation. In view of this, we suggest that CR may hinder prion propagation and PrPSc formation by stabilizing the template PrPSc so that the partial denaturation needed for the conversion of additional PrPC molecules is prevented. The effect of CR on PrPSc is not a function of the PrP sequence or its glycosylation profile but rather of its conformation. We conclude this from the fact that neither PrPC (Fig. 1) nor predenatured PrPSc (Fig. 3) changes its basic properties when incubated in the presence of CR. It has been shown in the past that CR does not inhibit the synthesis of PrPC(24Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 643-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CR association abolished the affinity of PrP-(27–30) to its antibodies. This affinity, very poor in purified PrP rods, was significantly enhanced only after PrP-(27–30) dispersion into DLPC. In addition, the comparison of the lines in Fig. 6 with and without guanidine denaturation suggests that inhibition of synthesis of new PrPSc by CR occurs even in the presence of the PrPSc molecules that were present in the cells before the addition of CR. Our results are consistent with yet another plausible conclusion. Since in the presence of CR, PrPSc seems to be “invisible” to either antibodies or metabolic cell components, it may also be invisible to components of the PrPC → PrPScconversion site. Whether this effect is due to direct inhibition of binding by CR or is also a result of the increased stability conferred to PrPSc by CR remains to be established. Scrapie incubation time may be determined not only by the concentration of PrPSc in the inoculum, but also by the number of PrPSc molecules available for binding to conversion sites. Indeed, PrP-(27–30) in DLPC, a more dispersed form of PrP, has been shown to be more infectious, by a factor of 10 or 100, than the same sample in the more aggregated form (33Gabizon R. McKinley M.P. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4017-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 46Kellings K. Meyer N. Mirenda C. Prusiner S.B. Riesner D. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1025-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Conversely, it is possible that highly aggregated as well as metabolically stable PrP will be less infectious, since it cannot interact efficiently with the crucial cell components needed for the conversion of PrPC. This is probably why it has been very difficult to correlate PrPScconcentrations with infectivity titer (47Lasmezas C.I. Deslys J.P. Robain O. Jaegly A. Beringue V. Peyrin J.M. Fournier J.G. Hauw J.J. Rossier J. Dormont D. Science. 1997; 275: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). As stated above, ScN2a cells did not produce new PrPSc in the presence of CR, although acidic guanidinium revealed the presence of large concentrations of very stable PrPSc. The results presented here suggest an interesting feature of transmissible amyloid diseases. While it is necessary for the aberrant isoform of the amyloidogenic protein to be stable enough to metabolic degradation, so that it can be present long enough in the cell to transform many normal molecules, an overstabilized aberrant conformation will inhibit the partial denaturation required for template formation. Interestingly, the amyloid aggregates from a nontransmissible brain neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's disease, cannot be denatured by SDS boiling but by much harsher conditions such as 6 m urea (48Masters C.L. Multhaup G. Simms G. Pottgiesser J. Martins R.N. Beyreuther K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2757-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Whether the anti-prion effect of CR is caused by stabilizing the scrapie conformation only or also by blocking the binding of PrPSc molecules to conversion sites, the fact that direct interaction of CR with PrPSc inhibits new PrPScsynthesis reinforces the notion that PrPSc is probably the crucial if not the only prion component. What molecules in the cell, in addition to PrPC, participate in the conversion reaction? Several molecules have been shown to either bind to PrP or be altered in scrapie-infected cells or brains (49Ovadia H. Rosenmann H. Shezen E. Halimi M. Ofran I. Gabizon R. J. Biol.

Experiments with transgenic mice have postulated the existence of a species-specific factor, denominated Protein X, which is yet to be identified (15Telling G.C. Scott M. Mastrianni J. Gabizon R. Torchia M. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 79-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The presence of glycosaminoglycan molecules such as heparan sulfate in every amyloid was proposed as evidence of their possible role in the scrapification of PrP (25Snow A.D. Wight T.N. Nochlin D. Koike Y. Kimata K. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lab. Invest. 1990; 63: 601-611PubMed Google Scholar). However, the fact that PrPC, although at a low efficiency, can be converted in vitro to a PrPSc-like molecule (43Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), suggests that such molecules may be important mostly for the kinetics of the reaction or for the pathogenesis of the prion disease. As proposed above, it is the very nature of PrPScconformation that probably hinders the finding of such molecules. Elucidating the diverse mechanisms by which the known anti-prion agents operate may help in understanding the biology of prion diseases and may also be a crucial step for the preparation of reagents that can be used in in vivo experiments and clinical trials. Some of them will eventually also be useful for the treatment of other amyloid disorders."

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologueCOQ7/CAT5 is essential for several metabolic pathways including ubiquinone biosynthesis, respiration, and gluconeogenic gene activation. We show here that Coq7p/Cat5p is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein directly involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis, and that the defect in gluconeogenic gene activation in coq7/cat5null mutants is a general consequence of a defect in respiration. These results obtained in the yeast model suggest that the effects on development and life span in C. elegans clk-1 mutants may relate to changes in the amount of ubiquinone, an essential electron transport component and a lipid soluble antioxidant.

Research into the components responsible for controlling longevity have uncovered both environmental effects and genetic determinants (1Holliday R. Understanding Aging. Cambridge University Press, New York, NY1995Crossref Google Scholar,2Jazwinski S.M. Science. 1996; 273: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been used as a model for many such studies. Multiple life-extension mutants have been identified which affect various aspects of development (3Lithgow G.J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). One of the genes identified in determination of life span was identified asClock-1 (clk-1). clk-1 mutants exhibit a pleiotropic phenotype, characterized by delayed embryonic and postembryonic development, a slowing of adult behaviors such as swimming, pharyngeal pumping, and defecation, and an extended life span (4Wong A. Boutis P. Hekimi S. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The clk-1 mutants also have an increased resistance to stress induced by UV treatment (5Murakami S. Johnson T.E. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently the C. elegans clk-1 gene was characterized and found to be conserved among eukaryotes, including humans, rodents, and the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae (6Ewbank J.J. Barnes T.M. Lakowski B. Lussier M. Bussey H. Hekimi S. Science. 1997; 275: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The yeast clk-1 homologue was independently isolated asCOQ7 and CAT5 (7Proft M. Kotter P.

The COQ7 gene is required for the synthesis of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q or Q), 1The abbreviations used are: Q, ubiquinone or coenzyme Q; QH2, reduced ubiquinone or ubiquinol; HHB, 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate; Coq7p, the polypeptide encoded byCOQ7; Coq7–1p, the polypeptide encoded by the point mutant allele of the yeast COQ7 gene; Cat5p, the polypeptide encoded by CAT5; Q6, ubiquinone containing six isoprene units; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HA, hemagglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: Q, ubiquinone or coenzyme Q; QH2, reduced ubiquinone or ubiquinol; HHB, 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate; Coq7p, the polypeptide encoded byCOQ7; Coq7–1p, the polypeptide encoded by the point mutant allele of the yeast COQ7 gene; Cat5p, the polypeptide encoded by CAT5; Q6, ubiquinone containing six isoprene units; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HA, hemagglutinin. an isoprenylated benzoquinone that functions in the respiratory electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes (9Brandt U. Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Like other yeastcoq mutants (10Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the coq7/cat5 mutants lack Q, are respiration defective, and are incapable of growing on nonfermentable carbon sources (8Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2995-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 10Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A yeast mutant harboring thecoq7-1 allele (encoding the substitution of Asp for Gly104) was found to accumulate both 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate (HHB) and a small amount of 2-hexaprenyl-3-methyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone, two intermediates in Q biosynthesis (8Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2995-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, mutants with deletions in theCOQ7 gene produce only HHB. HHB is the predominant Q intermediate that accumulates in yeast mutants with deletions in any one of six COQ genes (COQ3-COQ8) (11Poon W.W. Do T.Q. Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. Mol. Aspects Med. 1997; 18: s121-s127Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Transformation of either the coq7-1 point mutant or thecoq7 null mutant with the yeast COQ7 gene restored both growth on nonfermentable carbon sources and the synthesis of Q. These results led to the development of two models for Coq7p function in Q biosynthesis: (i) Coq7p may itself act in one or more monooxygenase steps in the pathway, and (ii) Coq7p provides a component of a multisubunit complex that is required for the conversion of HHB to Q (8Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2995-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 11Poon W.W. Do T.Q. Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. Mol. Aspects Med. 1997; 18: s121-s127Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Since the amino acid sequence shares no similarity to any known monooxygenase or hydroxylase proteins, there is little support for the first model. The COQ7/CAT5 homologue from either rat or C. elegans rescued the yeast coq7/cat5 mutant for growth on nonfermentable carbon sources, suggesting a conservation of function from yeast to animals (6Ewbank J.J. Barnes T.M. Lakowski B. Lussier M. Bussey H. Hekimi S. Science. 1997; 275: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 12Jonassen T. Marbois B.N. Kim L. Chin A. Xia Y.-R. Lusis A.J. Clarke C.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The yeast COQ7 gene was independently isolated asCAT5, a gene required for the release of gluconeogenic genes from glucose repression (7Proft M. Kotter P. Hedges D. Bojunga N. Entian K.-D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6116-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Glucose repression is a global regulatory system in S. cerevisiae that affects the transcription of genes involved in gluconeogenesis, alternative sugar metabolism, and respiration (13Johnston M.

Upon deletion of CAT5, binding of gene activators to the upstream activating sequences within gluconeogenic promoters was abolished resulting in a complete loss of gluconeogenic gene activation (7Proft M. Kotter P. Hedges D. Bojunga N. Entian K.-D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6116-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These data provided support for a role of Cat5p in the cascade regulating gluconeogenic gene activation. Other genes necessary for the release from glucose repression were identified by the characterization of glucose derepression mutants cat1(snf1) (16Zimmermann F.K. Kaufmann I. Rasenberger H. Haubetamann P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 151: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Carlson M. Osmond B.C. Botstein D.

Expression of gluconeogenic genes requires the pleiotropic Cat1p·Cat3p protein kinase complex (21Celenza J.L. Carlson M.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2502-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Since strains with mutations in genes mediating glucose repression (cat1, cat3, or cat8) were defective in activation of aCAT5-lacZ reporter gene, a coregulation of respiratory chain elements and gluconeogenesis was postulated (7Proft M. Kotter P. Hedges D. Bojunga N. Entian K.-D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6116-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the function of Coq7/Cat5p in yeast should provide insight regarding the function of clk-1 in aging and development in C. elegans. The apparent dual function of Coq7p/Cat5p in yeast Q biosynthesis and glucose derepression raised the question of whether the observed defect in Q biosynthesis resulted from a defect in glucose derepression, or vice versa. In the present study the relationship between these functions is further investigated. The strains of S. cerevisiae used in this study are described in Table I. Strains were grown in standard media as described (24Barkovich R.J. Shtanko A. Shepherd J.A. Lee P.T. Myles D.C. Tzagoloff A. Clarke C.F. J. Biol.

Growth and in vivo labeling of Q6 with p-[U-14C]hydroxybenzoic acid (365 Ci/mol) was as described (25Poon W.W. Marbois B.N. Faull K.F. Clarke C.F. Arch. Biochem.

Growth was monitored by OD600 nm measurements, and at the same time samples were taken for enzymatic assays. Yeast crude extracts were prepared with glass beads (26Ciriacy M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1975; 138: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer and the protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay method (Pierce). Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and isocitrate lyase activities were measured as described (27Hansen R.J. Hinze H. Holzer H. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Dixon G.H. Kornberg H.L. Biochem. J. 1959; 72: 3Google Scholar). Two yeast expression plasmids, one single copy and one multiple copy, were constructed to express the Coq7 polypeptide containing a carboxyl-terminal peptide (MYPYDVPDYASLDGPMST) corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) viral protein, an epitope for the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (29Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Walker L.E. Reisfeld R.A. Wilson I.A. Hogle J.M. Lerner R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4949-4953Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Construction was begun by directional cloning using SalI and NotI sites in the plasmid pADCL (30Spain B.H. Koo D. Ramakrishnan M. Dzudzor B. Colicelli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25435-25444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The COQ7yeast nucleotide sequence corresponding to the open reading frame was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotides containingSalI and NotI linkers to allow for the in-frame ligation of the COQ7 sequence. The sequences encoding the ADH promoter, COQ7 sequence, HA-epitope, and termination site were then liberated from pADCL by BamHI partial restriction enzyme digestion and subsequently ligated into theBamHI site of two plasmids pRS316 and pRS426 (31Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to give psHA71 and pmHA71 providing single and multiple copy plasmid maintenance in yeast, respectively. pNMQ71 is maintained in single copy and contains the COQ7 nucleotide sequence and 414 base pairs of upstream sequence, constructed as described previously (8Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2995-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were transformed with pNMQ71, psHA71, pmHA71, or pRS316 (32Elble R. Biotechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected for the presence of the URA3gene on SD-Ura plates. The Ura+ colonies were subsequently replica plated to YPG plate media. The Coq7-HA epitope fusion protein retains activity as assayed by the ability of either the single or multicopy plasmid construct to rescue coq7/cat5 null mutant yeast strains for growth on media containing a nonfermentable carbon source (YPG plates, data not shown). One of the coq7 null mutants used in the complementation above, JM43ΔCOQ7 (8Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2995-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), was used for subcellular localization by Western analysis. Cell cultures (1 liter) were grown in semisynthetic lactate media to saturation density. Spheroplasts were prepared and lysed by Dounce homogenization with a tight fitting pestle as described (33Glick P.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) with one exception: protease inhibitors were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and added prior to cell lysis. Final concentrations of the protease inhibitors were as follows: benzamidine 1 mm, leupeptin 1 μg/ml, pepstatin 2 μg/ml, chymostatin 1 μg/ml, aprotinin 1 μg/ml, antipain 1 μg/ml. Purified mitochondria were isolated from a linear Nycodenz gradient as described (33Glick P.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The outer mitochondrial membrane was broken by adding 5 volumes of ice-cold 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, to 2 mg of purified mitochondria. After a 10-min incubation on ice, the mixture was centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant contained the intermembrane space components while the pellet consisted of mitoplasts and disrupted outer membrane. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4. Integral and peripheral membrane proteins were separated via two methods: 1) alkaline carbonate extraction (34Jarosch E. Tuller G. Daum G. Waldherr M. Voskova A. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17219-17225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or 2) extraction with the same conditions as the first method, but with 2 m urea in place of alkaline carbonate as the extracting agent (35Nakai T. Yasuhara T Fujidi Y. Ohashi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4441-4452Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Fractions were assayed for protein concentration by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein from the mitochondrial fractions of cells containing the plasmids pNMQ71, psHA71, and pmHA71 were analyzed by electrophoresis on 12% Tris glycine gels and subsequently transferred to Hybond ECL Nitrocellulose (Amersham). Western analysis and membrane stripping were performed as described by Amersham. An exception to the stated protocol was the use of Western washing buffer: 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 154 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100. Polyclonal rabbit antisera were generated to detect Coq7p/Cat5p in a wild-type strain CEN.PK2–1C, and in both crude and purified mitochondria fractions. The COQ7/CAT5 reading frame was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into pGEX-CS1 (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) allowing for the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside inducible production of a 55-kDa GST-Coq7 fusion protein in E. coliRR1. The fusion protein was purified using preparative SDS-PAGE. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against Coq7p/Cat5p was obtained by the standard immunization protocol (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) with 1 mg of purified fusion protein. The primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: 12CA5, 1:10,000; OM45, 1:1,000; Mas2, 1:1,000; Sec62p, 1:500; Kex2p, 1:800; ALP, 1:3,000; Hsp60, 1:10,000; F1β-ATPase, 1:10,000; cyt c1, 1:200; GST-Coq7p polyclonal antiserum, 1:5,000. Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies to rabbit and mouse IgG (Amersham) were used in a 1:1,000 dilution, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) was used in a 1:5,000 dilution. To assay whether Q biosynthesis is affected by mutations in the glucose derepression system, yeast strains harboring mutations in cat1, cat3, or cat8 were tested for their ability to synthesize Q. A total lipid extract prepared from wild-type yeast grown in the presence ofp-[U-14C]hydroxybenzoic acid and separated by normal phase high performance liquid chromatography gives rise to a peak of radiolabeled material that co-elutes with a Q6standard (fractions 6 and 7, Fig. 1 A). When this same procedure is performed on radiolabeled lipid extracts from the cat1, cat3, or cat8 mutants, production of Q6 is still observed (Fig. 1, B, C, and E). Thus neither the pleiotropic Cat1p/Cat3p (Snf1p/Snf4p) protein kinase involved in glucose derepression nor the transcriptional activator of gluconeogenic genes Cat8p are essential for Q biosynthesis. However, the coq7/cat5 null mutant fails to produce Q6 (Fig. 1 D), and instead accumulates HHB, the predominant intermediate found in the yeast Q mutantscoq3-coq8 (8Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2995-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 11Poon W.W. Do T.Q. Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. Mol. Aspects Med. 1997; 18: s121-s127Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the inability to produce Q is a very specific defect and cannot be caused by a lack of glucose derepression in the examined mutant strains. To determine whether a general loss of respiration affects glucose derepression of gluconeogenic genes, activation of a PCK1-lacZ reporter fusion containing the entire phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter was assayed in a variety of respiratory yeast mutants. As shown in Table II, all of the wild-type strains used, although differing in absolute specific activities, reveal a dramatic increase in specific β-galactosidase activity upon the shift to nonfermentable growth conditions. In contrast, such induction is completely absent in thecoq7/cat5 mutant and in another Q-deficient mutant (coq3). A yeast strain containing a deletion in theATP2 gene (encoding the β subunit of the F1-ATPase) also fails to activate the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promotor, although Q is still produced in this strain (11Poon W.W. Do T.Q. Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. Mol. Aspects Med. 1997; 18: s121-s127Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The lack of ATPase activity causes a pleiotropic effect that results in a suppression of the bc1 complex and a severe reduction of respiration (10Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is a similar lack of β-galactosidase activation in four other mutants with defects in respiration. The mutants either affect the respiratory chain in a structural component (Cox7p, Ref. 36Calder K.M. McEwen J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), its synthesis (Cox10p, affecting heme a synthesis, Ref. 37Tzagoloff A. Norbrega M. Gorman N. Sinclair P. Biochem. Mol. Biol.

Open table in a new tab We tested whether respiration (as assayed by growth on ethanol) and derepression of gluconeogenic genes could be restored by exogenous Q. As shown in Fig. 2 the coq7/cat5 mutant fails to grow on media containing a nonfermentable carbon source (3% ethanol). This is also true for another coq mutant, coq3Δ, and two respiratory mutants, atp2Δ, and cor1Δ (completely lacks the bc1 complex, Ref. 40Tzagoloff A. Wu M.A. Crivellone M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 17163-17169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This growth defect was corrected in the two coqmutants by supplementation with 15 μm Q6, and after a brief lag compared with the wild-type strain, the rescuedcoq7/cat5 and coq3 strains grew to the same stationary cell titer. Neither the atp2 nor thecor1 mutants could be rescued by exogenously added Q6. The effect of the addition of Q6 on the derepression of gluconeogenesis was simultaneously investigated. Addition of Q6 fully restored gluconeogenic enzyme activities in both the coq7/cat5 mutant and thecoq3 mutant (Table III). However, such addition of Q6 failed to restore induction of these activities in the atp2 and cor1 mutants. Addition of Q6 also increased both the NADH dehydrogenase activity and the rate of oxygen consumption of the coqmutants; the latter showed a 2–3-fold increase from their average baseline in YPE alone of 10 μl of O2/min/OD (data not shown). However, oxygen consumption rates in the atp2 and cor1 mutants remained very low in the presence or absence of exogenous Q (baseline rates in YPE and YPE + Q6 were approximately 4 μl of O2/min/OD, data not shown). These data show that the loss of Cat5p/Coq7p indirectly influences induction of gluconeogenesis, and the defect can be completely suppressed by the addition of Q6.Table IIIQ6 rescues gluconeogenic enzyme levels in coq mutantsRelevant genotypeGrowth conditionsSpecific activitiesPEPCKICLmilliunits/mgWild typeYPD169YPE, 12 h, OD600 = 337110YPE, 27 h, OD600 = 174851YPE + Q6, 12 h, OD600 = 35357YPE + Q6, 27 h, OD600 = 177250Δcat5/Δcoq7YPD56YPE, 52 h, OD600 = 0.6<13YPE, 72 h, OD600 = 0.6<13YPE + Q6, 52 h, OD600 = 3112114YPE + Q6, 72 h, OD600 = 178554Δcoq3YPD174YPE, 48 h, OD600 = 0.695YPE, 72 h, OD600 = 0.6104YPE + Q6, 48 h, OD600 = 313095YPE + Q6, 72 h, OD600 = 223747atp2ΔYPD184YPE, 52 h, OD600= 0.6<11YPE, 72 h, OD600 = 0.711YPE + Q6, 52 h, OD600 = 0.6<11YPE + Q6, 72 h, OD600 = 0.7112cor1ΔYPD76YPE, 52 h, OD600= 0.6<12YPE, 72 h, OD600 = 0.775YPE + Q6, 52 h, OD600 = 0.7<13YPE + Q6, 72 h, OD600 = 0.6155 Open table in a new tab To determine the localization of Coq7p/Cat5p in yeast, we used a polyclonal antibody against Coq7p/Cat5p. As shown in Fig. 3, the specific immunodetection of the protein was possible exclusively in crude mitochondrial fractions of wild-type cells grown under nonfermentable conditions. Since Coq7p/Cat5p was not detectable in glucose-repressed cells (Fig. 3), we assume that most of the protein was synthesized during the transition from fermentative to respiratory growth. As judged by the mobility in SDS-PAGE, no deviation from the predicted molecular mass (31 kDa) was obtained. Further subcellular localization was performed by employing a fusion of the COQ7gene and the sequence coding for an epitope peptide from the hemagglutinin viral protein. Western analysis of yeast subcellular fractions indicates that the Coq7p-HA fusion protein cofractionates with the mitochondria (Fig. 4). The lack of mitochondrial contamination in the cytosol was verified with the mitochondrial marker F1β-ATPase (41Chen W.-J. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1987; 49: 651-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The crude mitochondrial fractions depicted in Figs. 3 and 4 contained some contaminating organelles, detected with antibodies to Sec62p (endoplasmic reticulum, Ref. 42Deshaies R.J. Schekman R. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2138167654,"Diacylglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP) is involved in a putative novel lipid signaling pathway. DGPP phosphatase (DGPP phosphohydrolase) is a membrane-associated 34-kDa enzyme fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae which catalyzes the dephosphorylation of DGPP to yield phosphatidate (PA) and then catalyzes the dephosphorylation of PA to yield diacylglycerol. Amino acid sequence information derived from DGPP phosphatase was used to identify and isolate the DPP1(diacylglycerol pyrophosphatephosphatase) gene encoding the enzyme. Multicopy plasmids containing the DPP1 gene directed a 10-fold overexpression of DGPP phosphatase activity in S. cerevisiae. The heterologous expression of the S. cerevisiae DPP1 gene in Sf-9 insect cells resulted in a 500-fold overexpression of DGPP phosphatase activity over that expressed in wild-type S. cerevisiae. DGPP phosphatase possesses a Mg2+-independent PA phosphatase activity, and its expression correlated with the overexpression of DGPP phosphatase activity in S. cerevisiae and in insect cells. DGPP phosphatase was predicted to be an integral membrane protein with six transmembrane-spanning domains. The enzyme contains a novel phosphatase sequence motif found in a superfamily of phosphatases. Adpp1Δ mutant was constructed by deletion of the chromosomal copy of the DPP1 gene. The dpp1Δ mutant was viable and did not exhibit any obvious growth defects. The mutant was devoid of DGPP phosphatase activity and accumulated (4-fold) DGPP.

The low abundance of DGPP is reminiscent of lipid signaling molecules such as the inositol-containing phospholipids (5Michell R.H. Trends Biochem.

Recent studies indicate that the metabolism of DGPP is involved in a novel lipid signaling pathway. DGPP accumulates in plant tissues upon G protein activation through the stimulation of PA kinase activity (3Munnik T. de Vrije T. Irvine R.F. Musgrave A. J. Biol.

Morr M. Wu W.-I. Carman G.M. Wissing J.B. Plant Sci. 1997; 128: 1-10Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that DGPP may function as a signaling molecule (3Munnik T. de Vrije T.

Alternatively, the formation of DGPP may serve to attenuate the signaling functions of PA (11English D. Cui Y. Siddiqui R.A. Chem. Phys.

When DGPP is supplied as a substrate for the pure enzyme, it removes the β phosphate of DGPP to generate PA, and then removes the phosphate of PA to generate DG (Fig. 1) (4Wu W.-I. Liu Y. Riedel B.

Indeed, DGPP phosphatase can utilize PA as a substrate in the absence of DGPP, although the enzyme has a 10-fold higher specificity constant for DGPP (4Wu W.-I. Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B.

DGPP phosphatase is an interesting enzyme insofar as the product of one reaction becomes the substrate for the subsequent reaction (Fig. 1). The regulation of this enzyme could control specific cellular pools of DGPP, PA, and DG and thus influence lipid signaling as well as overall lipid metabolism. The isolation of the gene encoding DGPP phosphatase is required for defined studies to examine the physiological roles of DGPP and DGPP phosphatase in eukaryotic cells. In this paper we report the isolation and initial characterization of the DPP1(diacylglycerol pyrophosphatephosphatase) gene encoding DGPP phosphatase in S. cerevisiae. This work represents the first report of the isolation of a eukaryotic gene encoding DGPP phosphatase. In addition, the chromosomal copy of the DPP1 gene was deleted from S. cerevisiae to produce a dpp1Δ mutant. The initial characterization of the dpp1Δ mutant showed that theDPP1 gene was not essential for cell growth and thatDPP1 was responsible for all of the detectable DGPP phosphatase activity in the cell.

Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The digested sample was washed twice with 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid. The digest was then subjected to narrowbore reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Zorbax C-18 column (1 × 150 mm, inner diameter) as described by Lane et al. (24Lane W.S. Galat A. Harding M.W. Schreiber S.L. J. Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Strategies for the selection of peptide fragments and their sequencing by automated Edman degradation were performed as described by Lane et al. (24Lane W.S. Galat A. Harding M.W. Schreiber S.L. J. Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The amino acid composition and amino acid sequencing analyses were performed at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (Cambridge, MA). Plasmid and genomic DNA preparation, restriction enzyme digestion, and DNA ligations were performed by standard methods (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transformation of yeast (27Ito H. Yasuki F. Murata K. Kimura A. J.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were performed as described previously. Conditions for the amplification of DNA by PCR were optimized as described by Innis and Gelfand (29Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 1-482Google Scholar). The annealing temperature for the PCRs was 50 °C, and extension times were typically between 2.0 and 2.5 min at 72 °C. PCRs were run routinely for a total of 30 cycles. DNA sequencing reactions were performed with the Prism DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle sequencing kit and analyzed with an automated DNA sequencer. Plasmid maintenance and amplifications were performed in E. coli strain DH5α. Amplification of the plasmid pDT1-DPP1 was performed in E. coli strain Epicurian ColiRXL-1. We identified an open reading frame DNA sequence in the Saccharomyces Genome Data Base (locus YDR284C) whose predicted amino acid sequence matched exactly the amino acid sequences derived from the DGPP phosphatase protein. This gene was named DPP1. A 1.9-kb DNA fragment containing 600 bp of the putative DPP1 promoter, its entire protein coding sequence, and 500 bp of the 3′-flanking sequence was obtained by PCR (primers: 5′-GTTACATTGTATCAGTCACAGGTACGG-3′ and 5′-GTCGACATTTATACATAGTATGTGTTAAGG-3′) using strain W303-1A genomic DNA as a template. The PCR product was ligated into the SrfI site of the pCRScriptTM AMP SK(+) cloning vector resulting in the formation of pDT1-DPP1. This plasmid was digested withSalI, which released a 2.0-kb fragment containing the open reading frame and approximately 600 bp of the promoter region and 500 bp of the 3′-untranslated region. This fragment was ligated into theSalI site of YEp351, a multicopy E. coli/yeast shuttle vector containing the LEU2 gene (30Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar), to form plasmid pDT2-DPP1. This construct was then transformed into W303-1A (W303-1A/pDT2-DPP1) for the overexpression of the DPP1 gene product. A genomic copy of the DPP1 gene was also isolated. The annotations accompanying the DPP1 sequence from the data bases indicated that the DPP1 gene flanked the 5′-end of theZIP1 gene, which was isolated by Sym et al. (31Sym M. Engebrecht J. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1993; 72: 365-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). We obtained the CEN plasmid p1219 that was used originally by Symet al. (31Sym M. Engebrecht J. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1993; 72: 365-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) for isolation of the ZIP1 gene. This plasmid contains an insert of yeast genomic DNA of approximately 20 kb. PCR and restriction enzyme analyses indicated that p1219 contained theDPP1 open reading frame and its flanking sequences. A 2.1-kb insert, containing the DPP1 gene, 740 bp of the promoter region, and 540 bp of the 3′-untranslated region, was released from p1219 by digestion with SpeI/SspI. This fragment was ligated into the SpeI/SmaI sites of pRS425, a multicopy E. coli/yeast shuttle vector containing theLEU2 gene (32Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar) to form plasmid pBZ1-DPP1. This construct was then transformed into W303-1A (W303-1A/pBZ1-DPP1) for the overexpression of the DPP1 gene product. The plasmid pDT1-DPP1 was digested with SnaBI/BstZ17I to remove the entireDPP1 coding sequence. A 2.8-kbTRP1/Kanr disruption cassette, derived from plasmid pJA52 (33Allen J.B. Elledge S.J. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1267-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) by SmaI digestion, was inserted into the blunt-ended SnaBI/BstZ17I sites of plasmid pDT1-DPP1 to form the plasmid pDT3-dpp1Δ. A linear 3.5-kbDPP1 deletion cassette was released from pDT3-dpp1Δ by digestion with SalI. This DNA fragment was transformed into W303-1A to delete the chromosomal copy of the DPP1 gene by the one-step gene replacement technique (34Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected for their ability to grow on complete synthetic medium without tryptophan. Deletion of the chromosomal copy of the DPP1gene was confirmed by PCR (35Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the primers listed above with the extension time increased to 3.5 min. The template for the PCRs used to confirm the DPP1 deletion was genomic DNA isolated from transformed colonies that grew on medium without tryptophan. One of thedpp1Δ mutants that we isolated was designated strain DTY1. DTY1 was transformed with pBZ1-DPP1 (DTY1/pBZ1-DPP1) to compliment thedpp1Δ mutant. Plasmid pBZ1-DPP1 was digested withMfeI/SalI to release the entire coding sequence of the DPP1 gene. This DNA fragment was ligated into theEcoRI/SalI sites of the pCRScriptTMAMP SK(+) vector resulting in the formation of plasmid pDT4-DPP1. This plasmid was then digested with KpnI/NotI, which released the DPP1 open reading frame. The DPP1gene was then ligated into the KpnI/NotI site of the baculovirus vector PVL1392 to form plasmid pWW1-DPP1. The pWW1-DPP1 plasmid was subsequently cotransfected with BaculoGoldTM Autographa californica DNA (Pharmingen) into a monolayer of Sf-9 cells using the CaCl2 method. The Sf-9 cells were routinely grown in TMNFH medium (36O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman, New York1992: 109-215Google Scholar) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. General procedures for the growth, maintenance, and infection of Sf-9 cells followed the methods described by O'Reilly et al. (36O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman, New York1992: 109-215Google Scholar). Routine infection of Sf-9 cells for DGPP phosphatase expression used 1–2 × 107 cells grown in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks. The cells were infected at a viral multiplicity of 10 and grown in TMNFH medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum for 48 h. The infected cells were collected by gentle trituration with medium, harvested by centrifugation, and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The final cell pellet was snap frozen over dry ice and stored at −80 °C. Cells that were not infected with virus, cells infected with virus containing the vector without the DPP1 gene, and cells infected with recombinant virus containing the S. cerevisiae choline kinase gene (37Hosaka K. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2053-2059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) served as controls. The expression of the S. cerevisiae choline kinase gene in insect cells will be described elsewhere. DGPP phosphatase was purified to homogeneity from S. cerevisiae as described by Wu et al.

The protein used for amino acid sequencing was derived from Mono Q II (4Wu W.-I. Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

PA kinase was purified from suspension-culturedC. roseus cells as described by Wissing and Behrbohm (2Wissing J.B. Behrbohm H.

Cells were washed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m sucrose, 1 mmNa2EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamide, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin and suspended (0.3 g, wet weight, of cells/ml) in the same buffer.

https://openalex.org/W2025559703,"The Bcl-2 family member Bcl-xLhas often been correlated with apoptosis resistance. We have shown recently that in peripheral human T cells resistance to CD95-mediated apoptosis is characterized by a lack of caspase-8 recruitment to the CD95 death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and by increased expression of Bcl-xL (Peter, M. E., Kischkel, F. C., Scheuerpflug, C. G., Medema, J. P., Debatin, K.-M., and Krammer, P. H. (1997) Eur. J. Immunol. 27, 1207–1212). This raises the possibility that Bcl-xLdirectly prevents caspase-8 activation by the DISC. To test this hypothesis a cell line in which CD95 signaling was inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-xL was used. In these MCF7-Fas-bcl-xL cells Bcl-xL had no effect on the recruitment of caspase-8 to the DISC. It did not affect the activity of the DISC nor the generation of the caspase-8 active subunits p18 and p10. In contrast, cleavage of a typical substrate for caspase-3-like proteases, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, was inhibited in comparison with the control-transfected CD95-sensitive MCF7-Fas cells. To test whether Bcl-xL would inhibit active caspase-8 subunits in the cytoplasm, a number of immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Using monoclonal antibodies directed against different domains of caspase-8, anti-Bcl-xLantibodies, or fusion proteins of glutathione S-transferase with different domains of caspase-8, no evidence for a direct or indirect physical interaction between caspase-8 and Bcl-xLwas found. Moreover, overexpression of Bcl-xL did not inhibit the activity of the caspase-8 active subunits p18/p10. Therefore, in this cell line that has become resistant to CD95-induced apoptosis due to overexpression of Bcl-xL, Bcl-xL acts independently and downstream of caspase-8. The Bcl-2 family member Bcl-xLhas often been correlated with apoptosis resistance.

Therefore, in this cell line that has become resistant to CD95-induced apoptosis due to overexpression of Bcl-xL, Bcl-xL acts independently and downstream of caspase-8. Apoptosis is essential for development and tissue homeostasis (1Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar). In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans genetic analysis identified three genes, ced-3, ced-4, and ced-9, that are essential to apoptosis during worm development (2Ellis R.E. Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar). Genetical ordering of the three genes revealed that ced-9 negatively regulates the induction of apoptosis by ced-3 (3Hengartner M.O. Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) and that this regulation requires the presence of ced-4 (4Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 578-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This suggests that ced-9 inhibits ced-3 through ced-4. Mammalian homologues of the C. elegans genes ced-3 and ced-9 have been identified. ced-3 shares high homology with the family of interleukin 1β-converting enzyme-like proteases (caspases) (5Yuan J.

Recruitment of caspase-8, which results in its activation (12Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E.

Interestingly, this DED was a region found to share weak homology with two areas in CED-4 (15Nagata S. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1241-1243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 16Bauer M.K. A Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 256-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent report demonstrated coimmunoprecipitation of Bcl-xL with caspase-8 and vice versa (17Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). These data suggest a regulatory mechanism in mammalian cells in which the CED-9 homolog Bcl-xL influences the activity of the CED-3 homolog caspase-8 possibly involving the CED-4 homology region of caspase-8. We have recently reported that in a CD95-resistant peripheral T cell population, FADD was recruited to the activated CD95 receptor, but recruitment and activation of procaspase-8 was not detected. In addition, this apoptosis resistance correlated with the expression of the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-xL (18Peter M.E. Kischkel F.C. Scheuerpflug C.G. Medema J.P. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1207-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), suggesting that it might directly render cells CD95 apoptosis resistant by interfering with the DISC. Recently, it was shown that overexpression of Bcl-xL inhibited CD95-mediated apoptosis without blocking initial caspase activation (19Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3759-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether Bcl-xL might interfere with recruitment of caspase-8 to the DISC or with the activity of caspase-8 using a breast carcinoma cell line MCF7 expressing high levels of CD95 (MCF7-Fas) (20Jäättelä M. Benedict M. Tewari M. Shayman J.A. Dixit V.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2297-2305PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of Bcl-xL in these cells renders them resistant to CD95-induced apoptosis (20Jäättelä M. Benedict M. Tewari M. Shayman J.A. Dixit V.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2297-2305PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, no DNA fragmentation, morphological changes, or cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) could be detected in these cells. However, cleavage of caspase-8 was not affected by overexpression of Bcl-xL. No direct or indirect association between Bcl-xL and caspase-8 could be detected, indicating that in these cells Bcl-xL acted independently and downstream of caspase-8. The breast carcinoma cell line MCF7 transfected with CD95 and a control plasmid (MCF7-Fas-vector) or CD95 and Bcl-xL (MCF7-Fas-bcl-xL) were a kind gift from M. Jäättelä (Kopenhagen, Denmark). They were cultured as described elsewhere (20Jäättelä M. Benedict M. Tewari M. Shayman J.A. Dixit V.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2297-2305PubMed Google Scholar). The SKW6.4 cells were cultured in RPMI + 10% fetal calf serum and 0.05 mg/ml gentamycin. An affinity-purified rabbit antipeptide antibody against the C terminus of caspase-8 was generated as described previously (13Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H.

The C5 mAb (IgG2a) recognizes the p10 subunit, the C1 mAb (IgG1) and C15 mAb (IgG2b) recognize the p18 subunit of caspase-8, and the N2 mAb (IgG1) recognizes the caspase-8 prodomain (21Scaffidi C.

The mouse mAb anti-APO-1 (IgG3, κ) recognizes an epitope on the extracellular part of APO-1 (22Trauth B.C. Klas C. Peters A.M.J. Matzku S. Möller P. Falk W. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H.

The rabbit polyclonal serum against Bcl-xL and the anti-FADD mAb (IgG1) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, Kentucky). The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies goat anti-rabbit IgG, goat anti-mouse IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b were purchased from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). All chemicals used were of analytical grade and purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) or Sigma. 106 cells were incubated in 24-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) with 1 μg/ml anti-APO-1 in medium (5 × 105 cells/ml) for 16 h at 37 °C. After incubation cells were photographed at a 400-fold magnification. Quantification of DNA fragmentation as a specific measure of apoptosis was carried out essentially as described elsewhere (23Peter M.E. Hellbardt S. Schwartz-Albiez R. Westendorp M.O. Moldenhauer G.

Using standard polymerase chain reaction and cloning techniques the following GST fusion proteins were generated: GST-FADD, GST-C-FADD (amino acids 89–207), GST-caspase-8, GST-N-caspase-8 (amino acids 1–180), and GST-C-caspase-8 (amino acids 181–478). GST fusion proteins were purified as described previously (10Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar), and 20 μg of each GST fusion protein precoupled to glutathione beads was used per precipitation. For immunoprecipitation 10 μg mAbs (25 μg in the case of C5) were coupled to either anti-IgG1 Agarose beads (C1, N2) (Sigma) or to protein A/G-plus agarose (C5) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and postnuclear supernatants of 107 cells were added and incubated for more than 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer (30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and small peptide inhibitors (12Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I.

The amount of DISC-associated FADD was determined as follows: 107 MCF7 cells were either first treated with 2 μg/ml anti-APO-1 for 5 min at 37 °C and then lysed (stimulated condition) or first lysed and then supplemented with 2 μg/ml anti-APO-1 (unstimulated condition) as described previously (12Kischkel F.C.

Triton X-100 solubilization of cellular proteins using the above lysis buffer and immunoprecipitation of CD95 was done as described previously (12Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). All immunoprecipitates were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. For Western blot detection of cytosolic proteins, cellular lysates equivalent to 5 × 105cells were prepared as described previously (12Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar) and separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis all samples were transferred to Hybond nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Corp.), blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS/Tween (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (Serva)) for at least 1 h, washed with PBS/Tween, and incubated with the following antibodies: anti-Bcl-xL serum (1:1000), anti-caspase-8 mAbs (1 μg/ml), or the mouse anti-FADD mAb (1 μg/ml). All antibodies were diluted in PBS/Tween. The blots were washed with PBS/Tween and developed with either goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:20,000) or goat anti-mouse IgG1, IgG2a, or IgG2b (1:20,000). After washing with PBS/Tween the blots were developed with the chemiluminescence method (ECL) following the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham). CD95 DISC was immunoprecipitated from 5 × 107 activated or nonactivated cells as described above, and immunoprecipitates were incubated with in vitro translated 35S-labeled caspase-8 in caspase-8 cleavage buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid, 10 mmdithiothreitol, and 10% sucrose) for 24 h at 4 °C. The cleavage reactions were stopped by addition of standard reducing sample buffer. After boiling for 3 min samples were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE, amplified (Amplify, Amersham), dried, and subjected to autoradiography. For in vitro PARP cleavage of active caspase-8 subunits, 5 × 107 MCF7-Fas cells were left untreated or stimulated with 2 μg/ml anti-APO-1. After 2 h cells were lysed, and lysates were made as described above. Lysates were precleared with mouse IgG, and the active caspase-8 subunits were subsequently precipitated with the C5 mAb as described above. After intensive washing precipitates were incubated in caspase-8 cleavage buffer together with 300 ng of recombinant PARP for 4 h at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of standard reducing sample buffer, separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with C-II-10. Since the CD95 DISC seemed to determine apoptosis sensitivity in peripheral T cells (18Peter M.E. Kischkel F.C. Scheuerpflug C.G. Medema J.P. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1207-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), we investigated whether expression of Bcl-xL would directly affect the composition of the DISC. However, normal T cells can hardly be transfected and overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL in lymphoid cells does not necessarily block the CD95 pathway (25Itoh N. Tsujimoto Y. Nagata S. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 621-627PubMed Google Scholar, 26Enari M. Hase A. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5201-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 27Strasser A. Harris A.W. Huang D.C.S.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Hence, we tested the effect of overexpression of Bcl-xL in a breast carcinoma cell MCF7-Fas, one of the few cell lines that have been reported to become resistant to CD95-mediated apoptosis upon overexpression of Bcl-xL (20Jäättelä M. Benedict M. Tewari M. Shayman J.A. Dixit V.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2297-2305PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed overexpression of Bcl-xLblocked the morphological changes (i.e. rounding up and detaching) induced by cross-linking of CD95 (Fig. 1 A). In addition, fragmentation of chromosomal DNA as compared with control-transfected MCF7-Fas cells was almost completely inhibited in the Bcl-xL transfectants (Fig. 1 B). This difference in sensitivity toward cross-linking of the CD95 receptor was not due to a difference in expression of the receptor, since both transfectants express similar amounts (data not shown), but due to the expression of Bcl-xL (Fig. 1 B). Recently, Chinnaiyan et al. (17Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) demonstrated in transient cotransfection experiments that Bcl-xL could be coimmunoprecipitated together with caspase-8 and vice versa. This association was indirect as it required an additional factor believed to be a mammalian CED-4 homolog (17Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Most importantly the data suggested that the CED-9 homolog Bcl-xL might act upstream of the CED-3 homolog caspase-8. Since in the MCF7-Fas cells apoptosis through CD95 involved activation of caspase-8 and CD95-mediated apoptosis in these cells was blocked by overexpression of Bcl-xL, we could now test this hypothesis in vivo in stably transfected cells. To this end we generated a number of reagents to use in immunoprecipitation experiments. All following experiments were done both with untreated and anti-APO-1-treated MCF7-Fas and MCF7-Fas-bcl-xL cells. First we tested whether Bcl-xL could be immunoprecipitated from MCF7 cells using fusion proteins of GST with different functional domains of caspase-8 or FADD (Fig. 2). Using GST-caspase-8 and GST-N-caspase-8 (comprising the first 188 amino acids of caspase-8 containing both DED), we could precipitate FADD from lysates of both transfectants (Fig. 2, B and D, lanes 7–10). Therefore, both DED containing GST-caspase-8 constructs were functionally active in binding the physiologically important signaling molecule FADD through their N termini. FADD was not precipitated when GST-C-caspase-8 was used (lacking the two N-terminal DED) (Fig. 2, B and D, lanes 11 and 12). We then tested whether cytoplasmic Bcl-xLfrom anti-APO-1-treated and untreated cells would coprecipitate with GST-caspase-8 or GST-C-caspase-8. As a control for specificity, we used GST, GST-FADD, or GST-C-FADD (lacking the DED). Bcl-xL was clearly detectable by Western blot analysis in Triton X-100 lysates from 5 × 105 MCF7-Fas-bcl-xL cells (Fig. 2 C, lanes 13 and 14). However, no associated Bcl-xL could be detected with any of the GST fusion proteins tested, although 20-fold more lysate (107 cells) was used for precipitation (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1–12). Since the GST domain might have prevented interaction of caspase-8 with Bcl-xL, specific anti-caspase-8 and anti-Bcl-xLantibodies were used for immunoprecipitation experiments (Figs.3 and 4). The two expressed caspase-8 isoforms (21Scaffidi C. Medema J.P. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and their cleavage products (p43, p41, p26, p24, p18) (21Scaffidi C. Medema J.P. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) were clearly detected in similar amounts in cellular lysates from unstimulated and anti-APO-1-stimulated cells (−/+ in Fig. 3). Immunoprecipitation with a rabbit anti-Bcl-xL serum detected Bcl-xL (Fig. 3 C). However, it completely failed to coimmunoprecipitate either full sized caspase-8 or any of its active subunits (Fig. 3, A and B).Figure 4Bcl-xL does not coimmunoprecipitate with caspase-8. Cellular lysates from 107 untreated or anti-APO-1 treated MCF7-Fas or MCF7-Fas-bcl-xL were incubated with Sepharose-coupled mAb against the caspase-8 p10 subunit (C5), the p18 subunit (C1), the N-terminal part (N2), or as a control mouse IgG. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the precipitated caspase-8 subunits using the C1 mAb to detect full-length caspase-8 and the p18 subunit (A and B) or the C5 mAb to detect the p10 subunit (C). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed for coimmunoprecipitation of Bcl-xL by Western blotting with a polyclonal anti-Bcl-xL antibody. As a control, cellular lysates of 5 × 105 MCF7-Fas or MCF7-Fas-bcl-xL cells were analyzed (lanes 17–20). E, the active caspase-8 subunits were immunoprecipitated using the C5 mAb, and after immunoprecipitation complexes were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with recombinant PARP. Resulting PARP cleavage was determined by immunoblotting with the C-II-10 mAb. Cells were stimulated as in Fig. 3. Immunoprecipitations were performed with 10 μg for C1, N2, and mIgG and with 25 μg for C5. Indicated are the positions of heavy and light chain (mainly visible in C5 immunoprecipitations due to aspecific cross-reaction of the secondary antibodies with the high amount of heavy and light chain present), caspase-8, p18, p10, Bcl-xL, and the p116 and p85 PARP fragments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To exclude that the antibodies against Bcl-xL interfered with the binding to caspase-8, we performed a reverse immunoprecipitation with different mAbs against either the C terminus or the N terminus of caspase-8 and determined whether coimmunoprecipitation of Bcl-xL could be detected. Using the C1 mAb, which recognizes the active caspase-8 subunit p18, we could immunoprecipitate full sized caspase-8 (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5, 6, 13, and 14) and both the p18 and the p10 subunits (Fig. 4, B and C, lanes 6 and 14), indicating that the mAb did not interfere with the complex formation between p10 and p18. However, no coimmunoprecipitation of Bcl-xL could be detected using this antibody (Fig. 4 D, lanes 5, 6, 13, and 14). The N2 antibody, which reacted with the caspase-8 prodomain, immunoprecipitated full sized caspase-8 (Fig. 4 A, lane 7, 8, 15, and 16), yet did not precipitate any Bcl-xL (Fig. 4 D, lanes 7, 8, 15, and 16). Since the reported interaction between Bcl-xL and caspase-8 was shown to involve both the N terminus and the p18 subunit of caspase-8 (17Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), both mAbs against caspase-8 used could still interfere with the interaction of Bcl-xL with caspase-8. Therefore, we made use of a third caspase-8 mAb, C5, that is directed against the p10 subunit. This region was reported by Chinnaiyan et al. (17Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) not to be involved in the binding of Bcl-xL. The C5 mAb immunoprecipitated both the full-length caspase-8 isoforms (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3, 4, 11, and 12) and the active subunits p18 and p10 (Fig. 4, B and C, lanes 4 and 12), indicating that the mAb did not interfere with complex formation between p10 and p18. However, also C5 did not coimmunoprecipitate any Bcl-xL (Fig. 4 D, lanes 3, 4, 11, and 12). Taken together in all experiments, no caspase-8/Bcl-xL association was detected even when the Western blots were highly overexposed (data not shown). To test whether Bcl-xL overexpression would inhibit the activity of caspase-8, we immunoprecipitated the active subunits p18/p10 and determined the in vitro PARP cleavage activity of the immunoprecipitated complex. The immunoprecipitate of the active subunits from anti-APO-1-treated cells using the C5 mAb displayed clear PARP cleavage in vitro (Fig. 4 E, lanes 4 and 12), while no cleavage of PARP was observed when caspase-8 was immunoprecipitated from untreated cells (Fig. 4 E, lanes 3 and 11) or when mIgG control immunoprecipitates were used (Fig. 6 E, lanes 1, 2, 9, and 10). Importantly, again no difference could be detected in in vitro PARP cleavage when the active subunits were immunoprecipitated from MCF7-Fas or MCF7-Fas-bcl-xL cells, indicating that overexpression of Bcl-xL did not affect the enzymatic activity of caspase-8. The above data indicate that Bcl-xL likely does not exert its inhibitory activity by physically interacting with procaspase-8 or active caspase-8 subunits in the cytoplasm, regardless whether anti-APO-1-treated or untreated cells were tested. We have shown recently that in vivocaspase-8 is activated by recruitment to the CD95 DISC (13Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). If Bcl-xL functioned upstream of caspase-8, it should interfere with caspase-8 cleavage by the DISC. The first step in DISC formation is recruitment of FADD (12Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). This can be visualized by immunoprecipitation of CD95 and subsequent immunoblotting with a FADD-specific mAb. Treatment of SKW6.4 B cell lymphomas with anti-APO-1 clearly resulted in an association of FADD with CD95 (Fig. 5 A, lanes 7 and 8). Similarly, both MCF7-Fas-vector and MCF7-Fas-bcl-xL cells, which express comparable amounts of FADD (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1 and 2), efficiently recruited FADD to CD95 after treatment with anti-APO-1 (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3–6). We next tested whether the activity of the DISC to process caspase-8 was affected by Bcl-xL overexpression. We have recently shown that this activity can be determined in vitro by incubation of immunoprecipitated DISC with in vitro translated35S-labeled caspase-8 (13Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Testing the MCF7-Fas transfectants in this assay demonstrated that Bcl-xLoverexpression did also not alter the activity of the DISC to activate caspase-8 in vitro (Fig. 5 B). To test whether Bcl-xL would inhibit cleavage of caspase-8 in vivo, the C15 mAb recognizing the p18 subunit of caspase-8 was used. This antibody allowed to follow caspase-8 activation in vivo by detecting both the full-length caspase-8 isoforms as well as the active caspase-8 subunit p18 (Fig. 6 A). Importantly, in both control transfected and Bcl-xL overexpressing MCF7-Fas cells the p18 subunit was formed to a similar extent and with identical kinetics (Fig. 6 A, lower panel). Furthermore, as has been shown previously for the SKW6.4 cell line (21Scaffidi C. Medema J.P. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), all full-length caspase-8 was processed after cross-linking of CD95 in both cell lines (Fig. 6 A, upper panel). In contrast to caspase-8 cleavage, cleavage of PARP, a typical substrate of caspase-3-like proteases (9Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Scaffidi C. Zhang M. Ni J.

Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar), was blocked in the Bcl-xL-overexpressing MCF7-Fas cells, while PARP was cleaved in the control-transfected MCF7-Fas cells upon anti-APO-1 treatment (Fig. 6 B). Taken together our data suggest that Bcl-xL inhibits the CD95 signaling pathway downstream of caspase-8 cleavage and upstream of the activity of caspase-3-like proteases. We have established that Bcl-xL does not block CD95-mediated apoptosis in MCF-Fas cells by directly interfering with either caspase-8 association with the DISC or caspase-8 activation in the DISC. Our data indicate that Bcl-xL does not associate with caspase-8 nor does it inhibit its activity. Therefore, Bcl-xL does not act at the level of caspase-8 activation, it rather acts downstream of caspase-8 and upstream of a PARP cleaving activity in these cells. Regulation of apoptosis in the nematode C. elegansserves as a paradigm for apoptosis regulation in mammalian cells. In the worm three genes dictate apoptosis during development (2Ellis R.E. Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar). Mutations in ced-3 or ced-4 abolish apoptosis, while mutation of ced-9 results in aberrant cell death. CED-9 is homologous to the mammalian Bcl-2 family and inhibits apoptosis induced by CED-3, which is homolog to the mammalian family of caspases and therefore responsible for execution of apoptosis. CED-4, another apoptosis-promoting gene product, physically interacts with CED-9 (17Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M.

CED-3 is most homologous to caspase-3-like proteases. It has been shown that Bcl-2 functions upstream of these caspases (27Strasser A. Harris A.W. Huang D.C.S. Krammer P.H. Cory S.

Since caspase-8 has a caspase-3-like activity, the question arose whether Bcl-2 family members could act upstream of caspase-8. Recently, it was suggested that Bcl-xL inhibits caspase-8 activity by physically interacting with caspase-8 (17Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). This association required CED-4 and was postulated to occur at the level of the mitochondria (39Golstein P. Science. 1997; 275: 1081-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that during CD95-mediated apoptosis caspase-8 is activated by recruitment to the CD95 DISC. After completion of this process all cytosolic caspase-8 can be converted to active caspase-8 subunits detectable in the cytoplasm (13Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). If Bcl-xL acts upstream of caspase-8, it would have to bind to either procaspase-8 in the DISC or to procaspase-8 or the active caspase-8 subunits in the cytoplasm. We now show that CD95-induced caspase-8 activation or activity is not affected by overexpression of Bcl-xL in the CD95-resistant cell line MCF7-Fas-bcl-xL. Bcl-xL did not affect the activity of the DISC. In addition, Bcl-xL did not interfere with PARP cleavage activity of the caspase-8 active subunits p10/p18 when immunoprecipitated using mAbs against the caspase-8 active subunits p10 (Fig. 6 E) or p18 (data not shown). Recently, the existence of a caspase activity upstream of Bcl-xL was suggested studying Bcl-xL-transfected Jurkat cells using PARP cleavage as a read-out (19Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3759-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In this study Bcl-xL-transfected Jurkat cells were resistant to CD95-mediated apoptosis, but PARP was still cleaved. It was suggested that caspase-8 was responsible for the observed PARP cleavage in these cells. However, the identity of the PARP cleaving caspase was not determined. We now show that in MCF7-Fas-bcl-xL cells PARP cleavage was completely blocked by overexpression of Bcl-xL, whereas caspase-8 activity was unchanged. The discrepancy between the two reports is likely due to different cell lines used. Our data demonstrate that first, in vivo PARP was not directly cleaved by caspase-8, and second, another caspase-3-like protease that cleaves PARP was blocked by Bcl-xL. Our data suggest that Bcl-xL acts downstream of caspase-8. The indirect association between caspase-8 and Bcl-xL that has been reported previously was based on experiments that used a transient transfection assay (17Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). We now have tested this interactionin vivo in stably transfected MCF7 cells by performing immunoprecipitation experiments using highly sensitive anti-Bcl-xL and anti-caspase-8 antibodies. To prevent competition of the anti-caspase-8 mAbs and Bcl-xL for the same binding site, we used mAbs against three different regions of caspase-8 (the prodomain and the p18 and p10 subunits). Consistent with the lack of functional inhibition of caspase-8 in the DISC, no coimmunoprecipitation of Bcl-xL with caspase-8 or vice versa was detectable. We have recently shown that CD95 resistance in short term activated peripheral T cells is characterized by a lack of caspase-8 recruitment to the DISC despite high expression of caspase-8 in the cytoplasm (18Peter M.E. Kischkel F.C. Scheuerpflug C.G. Medema J.P. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1207-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that the expression of Bcl-xLcorrelated with CD95 apoptosis sensitivity in these T cells, making it possible that Bcl-xL directly prevented caspase-8 recruitment to the DISC. However, for caspase-8 being the main target for Bcl-xL is in contradiction to the reported effects of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL on the CD95 signaling pathway in lymphoid cells. Reports range from no inhibition (27Strasser A. Harris A.W. Huang D.C.S. Krammer P.H. Cory S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6136-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 28Chinnaiyan A.M. Orth K.

One of the few cell lines that have been reported to be completely resistant to CD95 apoptosis after overexpression of Bcl-xL is the breast carcinoma cell line MCF7-Fas (20Jäättelä M. Benedict M. Tewari M. Shayman J.A. Dixit V.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2297-2305PubMed Google Scholar). Using these cells we did not find any association of Bcl-xLwith procaspase-8 or caspase-8 active subunits or any effect of Bcl-xL on caspase-8 activation. However, our experiments do not exclude that Bcl-xL could influence the action of caspase-8 by preventing a possible translocation of the caspase-8 active subunits within the cell from one location to their physiological target(s) without blocking their enzymatic activity. The presence of homologous functionally interchangeable proteins inC. elegans and mammals suggests a universal principle in apoptosis regulation conserved throughout evolution. The data presented here demonstrate that the CED-9 homolog Bcl-xL does not act by interfering with the activation of the CED-3 homolog caspase-8. Therefore, apoptosis sensitivity is at least regulated at two separate levels: at the level of the DISC and independently further downstream at the level of Bcl-xL likely regulating the activity of other CED-3 homologs. In contrast to C. elegans mammalian cells seem to have developed at least two levels at which caspases act. First level caspases, such as caspase-8, may couple the intracellular death machinery to death receptors and may not be regulated by CED-9-like molecules. Second level caspases likely representing caspase-3-like proteases located downstream of mitochondria may represent the CED-3 homologs likely to be regulated by the CED-9 homolog Bcl-xL (Bcl-2). While this manuscript was being reviewed cloning of a human CED-4 homolog Apaf-1 was reported (41Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar). Upon binding of cytochrome c Apaf-1 was demonstrated to activate caspase-3. This finding is in complete agreement with our observation that Bcl-xL acts downstream of caspase-8, since it also places the action of a human CED-4 homolog downstream of caspase-8.

The experimental system consisted of the [3H]retinol-RBP complex, Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant apo-CRBP containing the 10 amino acid long streptavidin-binding peptide sequence at its C terminus (designated as CRBP-Strep) and permeabilized human placental membranes. [3H]Retinol transfer from RBP to CRBP-Strep was monitored by measuring the radioactivity associated with CRBP-Strep retained by an immobilized streptavidin resin. Using this assay system, we have demonstrated that optimal retinol uptake is achieved with holo-RBP, the membrane receptor and apo-CRBP. The effects are specific: other binding proteins, including β-lactoglobulin and serum albumin, despite their ability to bind retinol, failed to substitute for either RBP or apo-CRBP. The process is facilitated by membranes containing the native receptor suggesting that this protein is an important component in the transfer mechanism. Taken together, the data suggest that the RBP receptor, through specific interactions with the binding proteins, participates (either directly or via associated proteins) in the mechanism which mediates the transfer of retinol from extracellular RBP to intracellular CRBP.

Higher eukaryotic organisms depend upon the dietary supply of vitamin A for a range of essential biological processes including vision, reproduction, growth, and development (1Blomhoff R. Green M.H. Berg T. Norum N.R. Science. 1990; 250: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Dietary vitamin A is first transported into the liver, where it forms a complex with a specific 21-kDa carrier protein, called retinol-binding protein (RBP). 1The abbreviations used are: RBP, retinol-binding protein; CRBP, cellular retinol-binding protein; pCMBS, p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: RBP, retinol-binding protein; CRBP, cellular retinol-binding protein; pCMBS, p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. The retinol-RBP complex is then secreted into the plasma, where it associates with another protein, transthyretin forming the main transporting complex (2Goodman D. Sporn M. Roberts A.B. Goodman D. Retinoids. 2. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1984: 41-88Google Scholar, 3Sivaprasadarao A. Findlay J.B.C. Blomhoff R. Vitamin A in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 87-117Google Scholar). Within the cytoplasm of vitamin A-requiring cells, retinol is transported by cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP), a 15-kDa protein that is structurally distinct from RBP (4Ong D.E. Nutr. Rev. 1994; 52: 524-531Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the transfer of retinol from extracellular RBP to intracellular CRBP is effected is the subject of much debate. Accumulated evidence suggests that the initial step involves the interaction of RBP with a specific cell surface receptor (5Heller J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3613-3619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sivaprasadarao A. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 561-569PubMed Google Scholar, 7Shingleton J.L. Skinner M.K. Ong D.E.

However, there have been conflicting reports concerning the mechanism by which the release of retinol to the intracellular phase occurs. Work with retinal pigment epithelial cells (11Chen C.C. Heller J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5216-5221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and placental brush-border membranes (12Sivaprasadarao A. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem J. 1988; 255: 571-579PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that, following the binding of RBP to the receptor, retinol is delivered to the cell, and the resultant apo-RBP remains in the extracellular compartment. By contrast, with liver paranchymal (8Senoo H. Strang E. Nilsson A. Kindberg G.M. Berg T. Ross N. Norum K.R. Blomhoff R. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1229-1239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and F9 teratocarcinoma (10Matarese V. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18859-18865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cells, the RBP-receptor complex is believed to be internalized by endocytosis and subsequently degraded releasing the retinol. Whether the type of mechanism employed is cell type-specific remains to be established. However, in either case the mechanism by which retinol is subsequently transferred to CRBP is not clear. Others (13Noy N. Xu Z.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3613-3619Google Scholar) argue that vitamin A, being in equilibrium with RBP and extremely hydrophobic, readily partitions into the lipid phase of the membrane. Retinol is then assumed to be transferred to the intracellular binding proteins, again by diffusion. Further support for the existence of specific RBP receptors has been obtained from a number of more recent studies. First, purification of an RBP receptor has been reported from pigment epithelial cells (14Bavik C.O. Busch C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23035-23042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and placental membranes (15Sivaprasadarao A. Boudjelal M. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Second, mutations introduced into RBP decrease or abolish the interaction of the protein with its receptor without affecting the retinol binding capacity of RBP (16Sivaprasadarao A. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem J. 1994; 300: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Based on the knowledge of the three-dimensional structures of RBP (17Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. Aqvist J. Sundelin J. Eriksson U. Rask L. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1451-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and CRBP (18Cowan W.S. Newcomer M.E. Jones A.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1225-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) complexed with retinol, and the currently available information on RBP-receptor interactions, we have put forward a hypothesis according to which the RBP receptor directly mediates the transfer of retinol from extracellular RBP to intracellular CRBP (19Sivaprasadarao A. Boudjelal M. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this paper, using the recombinant binding proteins and human placental membranes, we provide experimental support for this hypothesis. Streptavidin-agarose, 2-iminobiotin, human serum albumin, bovine β-lactoglobulin, egg albumin, all-trans-retinol, p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (pCMBS) sodium salt, dibutyl phthalate, and transthyretin were purchased from Sigma. All-trans-[11,12-3H]retinol (40 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products Inc. Dinonyl phthalate was from BDH. Restriction and modification enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim or Promega. Pfu DNA polymerase was purchased from Stratagene. The GeneClean Kit was from Anachem. Bio-Beads SM-2 was from Bio-Rad. All other reagents and chemicals were of appropriate grade and obtained from Sigma, Pharmacia, or BDH. Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene) and BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) were used for general cloning and expression purposes, respectively. pT7.7 was a gift from S. Tabor, Harvard University, Boston, MA. pASK60 was from Biometra. The human CRBP cDNA clone in the pSP64 vector was kindly provided by Dr. U. Eriksson (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Stockholm, Sweden). Oligonucleotides were synthesized and supplied by Genosys. ThePstI fragment containing the human CRBP cDNA was first subcloned from the pSP64 vector into pKS Bluescript such that the cDNA was oriented in the 5′ → 3′ direction under the T7 promoter. The EcoRI and BamHI fragment from the resultant construct, pKS-CRBP, was then subcloned into the E. coliexpression vector pT7.7. The resultant construct, pT7.7-CRBP (see Fig. 1 for a schematic diagram of the following steps) was subjected to deletion PCR (16Sivaprasadarao A. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem J. 1994; 300: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) to remove the 5′-noncoding sequence of CRBP with concomitant fusion of the coding region (from second amino acid) to the initiation codon ATG in pT7.7, using the following primers: 5′-CCAGTCGACTTCACTGGGTAC-3′ (sense) and 5-CATATGTATAATCTCCTTC-3′ (antisense). The sense primer corresponds to nucleotides encoding +2 to +8 amino acids in the CRBP cDNA (20Colantuoni V. Romano V. Bensi G. Santoro C. Costanzo F. Rangei G. Cortese R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7769-7776Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) while the antisense primer represents the ATG codon and 15 nucleotides upstream from it in the plasmid pT7.7. The PCR was performed in a 100-μl volume using 50 pmol of each phosphorylated primer, 10 ng of pT7.7-CRBP, 200 μm deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), 10 μl of 10 × cloned Pfu DNA polymerase buffer (supplied by Stratagene), and 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase. Thirty cycles, each consisting of 40 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, and 10 min at 72 °C, with a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min, were carried out. The PCR product was purified from agarose gels using the GeneClean kit, self-ligated at 16 °C overnight with 1 unit of T4 DNA ligase and used to transform E. coli XL-Blue cells. Clones were screened for loss of theEcoRI site by restriction enzyme analysis. Positive clones were subsequently sequenced to confirm the deletion and that no errors had occurred during PCR. The resulting plasmid is referred to as pT7.7-CRBP(del). To make the construct that allows the expression of CRBP as a fusion protein with streptavidin binding sequence (Ser-Ala-Trp-Arg-His-Pro-Glu-Phe-Gly-Gly) at its C terminus (21Schmidt T.G.M. Skerra A. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), the nucleotide sequence encoding this peptide (Strep-tag) was excised from the plasmid pASK60-Strep using BamHI and HindIII and subcloned into pT7.7-CRBP-(del). Deletion PCR was carried out (as described above) on the resultant construct to fuse the strep-tag to the last amino acid of CRBP, using the following primers: 5′-AGCGCTTGGCGTCACCCGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTTCATAAGTTCTTCCACGTC-3′ (antisense). The PCR product was self-ligated and used to transformE. coli XL blue cells. The desired clones were identified by the loss of the BamHI site and then confirmed by DNA sequencing. The construct was termed pCRBP-Strep. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with pCRBP-Strep and large scale expression carried out in a series of 20-ml cultures as follows. An overnight culture was set up in 5 ml of Luria broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin (LB/amp medium) using a single colony from freshly transformed BL21 (DE3) cells. From this overnight culture, 80 μl were used to inoculate 4 ml of LB/amp medium. After growing the cells for 2 h at 37 °C and 200 rpm, 16 ml of LB/amp medium were added. Growth was continued until the cell density reached A 600 of 0.3 at which point isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm and the induction carried out for 3 h at 30 °C. Induced cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl). The cells were then incubated with lysozyme at 0.5 mg/ml for 20 min at room temperature and sonicated (20 s bursts at 50% power) on ice, using an Ultrasonics Inc. sonicator. The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and the supernatant applied to 0.5 ml of streptavidin-agarose, packed in a 2-ml column and equilibrated with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA. After washing the resin with 5 ml of this equilibration buffer, the bound protein was eluted with 2.5 ml of elution buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-iminobiotin). The fusion protein was dialyzed against distilled water at 4 °C, concentrated by freeze-drying and assayed for protein content by Lowry's method (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression and purification of recombinant RBP (rRBP) was performed as described previously (23Sivaprasadarao A. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem J. 1993; 296: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Removal of retinol from rRBP and substitution with [3H]retinol was carried out as described by Chen and Heller (11Chen C.C. Heller J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5216-5221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activities of the final preparation varied from 3 to 5 Ci/mmol. Brush-border membrane vesicles were prepared from freshly obtained human placenta according to the method of Booth et al. (24Booth A.G. Olaniyani R.O. Vanderpaye O.A. Placenta. 1980; 1: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The membranes (30 mg of protein) were dialyzed exhaustively against deionized distilled water containing 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C, freeze-dried, and resuspended in 20 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl). After gentle homogenization with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer, the suspension was stirred for 2 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed against distilled water containing 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, freeze-dried, and resuspended in 30 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.2 m NaCl and assayed for retinol binding activity as below. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of PBS containing 0.4% Triton X-100 and stored as aliquots at −20 °C. Human red blood cell membranes were prepared according to the method of Dodge et al. (25Dodge J.T. Mitchell C. Hanahan D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1963; 100: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3632) Google Scholar). Packed red cells were washed four times with 10 volumes of 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmphosphate, pH 7.2, at 4 °C and the supernatant and white cell “buffy coat” removed by aspiration each time. The cells were lysed in 10 volumes of ice-cold 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0 (containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was carefully removed and the process repeated until the membranes were light pink (three times). These membranes were suspended in ice-cold extraction buffer and treated as above prior to the transport assay. The binding of all-trans-retinol to E. coli-derived apo-CRBP-Strep fusion protein was assayed by measuring the retinol-induced quenching of protein fluorescence as described by Coganet al. (26Cogan U. Kopelman M. Modady S. Shinitzky M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The titrations were carried out at 22 °C in PBS containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 1 mm EDTA by adding small increments of freshly prepared ethanolic solutions of retinol to 2 ml of 1 μm CRBP. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 290 and 340 nm, respectively. A solution of N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide having an absorbance at 290 nm equal to that of the protein was used as the control. [3H]Retinol transfer from [3H]retinol-RBP complex to CRBP-Strep tag was assayed using placental or erythrocyte membranes washed as above. 20 μl of 10 × assay buffer (1% ovalbumin in 10 × PBS), 10 pmol of [3H]retinol-RBP (8–9 × 104disintegrations/min) and 50 pmol of CRBP-Strep tag fusion protein were added to 100 μl of membranes (2 mg of protein/ml). The volume was made up to 200 μl with water. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the sample was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min to pellet the membranes. The resulting supernatant was mixed with 50 μl of 500 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and applied to a column packed with 0.5 ml of streptavidin-agarose resin. After washing the resin with 5 ml of wash buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), the bound protein was recovered with 1.5 ml of elution buffer (100 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-iminobiotin, pH 8.0). The radioactivity in the eluate was measured in a Packard 1900TR liquid-scintillation counter. This gave a measure of [3H]retinol transferred to CRBP-Strep tag. Incubations in the absence of membranes were also carried out to estimate nonspecific transfer of [3H]retinol to CRBP. All assays were performed in duplicate. The sucrose density gradient centrifugation assay for retinol binding activity in the EDTA extract of the membranes (see above) was carried out as described by Sani (27Sani B.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 91: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Unwashed placental membranes (5 mg of protein/ml) were resuspended in 1% Nonidet P-40 and after incubation on ice for 20 min, centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was treated with Bio-Beads SM-2 to remove excess detergent (28Holloway P.W. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). The detergent-free extract containing 2.5 mg of protein was incubated at 4 °C in the dark for 4 h with 50 pmol of [3H]retinol in the absence or presence of 10 nmol of unlabeled retinol. The mixture was diluted with an equal volume of 6 m urea, dialyzed against 3 m urea in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 20 mm mercaptoethanol, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 (equilibration buffer), and loaded onto a Sephadex G-75 column (75 × 2 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. Fractions (1.5 ml) collected were counted for radioactivity. Levin et al. (29Levin M.S. Locke B. Yang N.C. Li E. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17715-17723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported the over-expression of rat CRBP in E. coli and showed that the expressed protein was similar to the native protein in terms of its ability to bind retinol. Here, we expressed the human protein as a fusion construct with the 10-amino acid long streptavidin-binding sequence (Strep tag) (21Schmidt T.G.M. Skerra A. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) added to its C terminus. The fusion protein, referred to as CRBP-Strep, could be readily purified from the crude extracts of the cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pCRBP-Strep in a single affinity chromatographic step using streptavidin-agarose resin (Fig. 2 a). The purified protein migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a single band of apparent molecular mass ∼16 kDa, the size expected for the fusion protein (Fig. 2 b). The CRBP-Strep fusion protein accounted for approximately 50% of the total E. coli protein. To ensure that the addition of Strep tag does not affect its ability to bind retinol, we determined the affinity of the expressed fusion protein for retinol by monitoring the quenching of protein (tryptophan) fluorescence upon ligand binding (Fig. 3). The apparent dissociation constant (K d), determined from the quenching data, was 20 ± 2 nm, in good agreement with the value (26 ± 20 nm) reported by Levin et al. (29Levin M.S. Locke B. Yang N.C. Li E. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17715-17723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for rat CRBP. We also measured the UV-visible spectrum (240–380 nm) of the fusion protein and found no absorbance peaks other than that at 280 nm, suggesting the absence of any bound UV-absorbing ligand. The data suggest that the expressed tagged protein is similar to native CRBP in terms of its retinol binding ability and therefore should be suitable for the retinol transfer studies. To examine the hypothesis that the membrane-bound receptor might mediate the transfer of retinol from extracellular RBP to cytoplasmic CRBP, we have developed a simple assay using human placental membranes as the source of the receptor and the E. coli-expressed recombinant CRBP-Strep fusion protein. Membranes prepared from the placental brush-border tend to form sealed outside-out vesicles, thereby preventing access to the cytoplasmic surface of the membranes of exogenously added CRBP-Strep. The cytoplasmic phase of these membranes might also contain some endogeneous bound CRBP, thus reducing the number of binding sites available for the exogenously added CRBP-Strep. For these reasons, membranes prepared using the conventional protocols may be unsuitable for investigating the transfer of retinol to CRBP. We, therefore, treated the membranes with EDTA to remove any CRBP and added a small amount of Triton X-100 to prevent formation of sealed vesicles. To assay the transfer of [3H]retinol from RBP to CRBP, we incubated RBP, complexed with [3H]retinol, and apo-CRBP-Strep with washed membranes under a variety of conditions. Following incubation, the membranes were removed by centrifugation and CRBP-Strep isolated from the supernatant by affinity chromatography with streptavidin-resin. Under the conditions used for chromatography, [3H]retinol associated with RBP was eluted in the flow-through, whereas that transferred to CRBP-Strep tag was retained by the resin. The resin-bound CRBP-Strep was subsequently released with iminobiotin and assayed for radioactivity. The results (Table I) clearly show that the transfer of [3H]retinol from RBP to CRBP was about 3-fold greater in the presence of membranes than in their absence. To eliminate the possibility that the process is mediated by the lipid rather than the protein fraction of the membranes, the effect of heat treatment of the membranes on the transfer activity was examined. Heating the membranes at 90 °C for 10 min, prior to the transfer assay abolished the transfer of [3H]retinol from RBP to CRBP. The transfer activity reached equilibrium within 30 min.Table IEffect of placental membranes on [3H]retinol uptake by CRBPExperimental condition[3H]Retinol transferred to CRBPdpmNo membranes2826 ± 300PBS-treated membranes9876 ± 806Heat-denatured membranes2368 ± 345pCMBS-treated membranes3227 ± 239Erythrocyte membranes1841 ± 165 Open table in a new tab To demonstrate that the membrane-mediated transfer is dependent on the RBP receptor, we treated the membranes with 5 mm pCMBS, a compound which has previously been shown to inhibit the ability of RBP to interact with its receptor (12Sivaprasadarao A. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem J. 1988; 255: 571-579PubMed Google Scholar). Unreacted pCMBS was removed by washing the membranes prior to the binding assay, to rule out the possibility that any inhibition observed could be the result of pCMBS interaction with the binding proteins (RBP and CRBP). As can be seen from the data in Table I, this treatment almost completely abolished the membrane-mediated transfer of [3H]retinol from RBP to CRBP, suggesting that the receptor is an obligatory part of the transport mechanism. Finally, the experiment was repeated with washed erythrocyte ghosts. This membrane system is not thought to contain the RBP receptor (11Chen C.C. Heller J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5216-5221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results show a transfer rate not significantly different from that obtained with heat-treated placental membranes, offering further support for a receptor-mediated transfer mechanism. The specificity of the transfer activity of placental membranes with respect to RBP was assessed by examining the ability of a homologue, β-lactoglobulin, and serum albumin to inhibit the transfer of [3H]retinol from the [3H]retinol-RBP complex to CRBP-Strep. These two proteins resemble RBP and CRBP in terms of their ability to bind retinol with high affinity but neither competes with RBP for binding to its receptor (6Sivaprasadarao A. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 561-569PubMed Google Scholar). It was found that neither of these proteins, in their retinol-bound form, inhibited the transfer process (Table II). The fact that β-lactoglobulin, despite its high degree of structural similarity to RBP (30Papiz M.Z. Sawyer L. Eliopoulos E.E. North A.C.T. Findlay J.B.C. Sivaprasadarao A. Jones T.A. Newcomer M.E. Kraulis P.J. Nature. 1986; 324: 383-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar), failed to inhibit the transfer process again indicates that the receptor is highly specific for RBP.Table IISpecificity of retinol transfer activity of placental membranesCompeting protein[3H]Retinol transferred to CRBPdpmNone9,876 ± 806Retinol-RBP5,456 ± 698Retinol-β-lactoglobulin10,438 ± 719Retinol-human serum albumin12,015 ± 362 Open table in a new tab Fig. 4 shows that the retinol transfer activity of the membranes is inhibited by unlabeled RBP in a concentration-dependent manner, approximately 50% inhibition occurring at a 15-fold molar excess of the unlabeled protein. This indicates that the transfer activity is mediated by a limited number of receptor molecules. The efficiency of apo-CRBP to act as the recipient of retinol delivered via the RBP receptor system was examined by testing the ability of the defatted forms of human serum albumin and bovine β-lactoglobulin to substitute for CRBP. Since these native proteins possess no tags to aid their purification, a different approach was used. This involved measuring the loss of [3H]retinol from the RBP complex isolated from the reaction mixture using a transthyretin affinity resin. The data (Table III) show that both human serum albumin and bovine β-lactoglobulin are much less efficient than apo-CRBP in terms of their ability to accept [3H]retinol delivered from RBP even though they have similar affinities for the ligand. The radioactivity transferred with these proteins probably arises from free equilibration. Table III also demonstrates that the holo-form of CRBP is unable to induce retinol release from RBP. Interestingly, this was also true of the membrane in the absence of any protein acceptor.Table IIISpecificity of [3H]retinol uptake by CRBPAcceptor protein[3H]Retinol transferred from RBPdpmNone752 ± 144Apo-CRBP15,660 ± 576Holo-CRBP1,440 ± 20Human serum albumin4,492 ± 300β-Lactoglobulin4,888 ± 45 Open table in a new tab Fig. 5 shows that when the EDTA extract of placental membranes was incubated with [3H]retinol and then subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation, a single radioactive peak at 2 S was observed. This peak was not present in the incubations carried out in the presence of a 200-fold molar excess unlabeled retinol. To determine the molecular weight of the protein, detergent-solubilized placental membrane proteins were treated with [3H]retinol and subjected to gel filtration using Sephadex G-75. Gel filtration was performed in the presence of 3 m urea to prevent any aggregation of the protein. A radioactive peak was observed at the 15 kDa position (Fig. 6). The peak was absent when the incubations were carried out in the presence of excess unlabeled retinol. These studies suggest normal association of apo-CRBP with native placental membranes. The data, however, do not exclude the possibility that a protein distinct from, but similar to, CRBP might be present in the extract.Figure 6Gel filtration of Nonidet P-40 extract of placental membranes. Gel filtration of the placental membrane proteins treated with 50 pmol of [3H]retinol alone (○) or [3H]retinol plus 10 nmol of unlabeled retinol (•) was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The column was calibrated using standard molecular weight marker proteins.

Previous studies have demonstrated that these membranes contain receptors that specifically interact with the circulating RBP and induce the release of retinol from the binding protein (11Chen C.C. Heller J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5216-5221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sivaprasadarao A. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem J. 1988; 255: 571-579PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we examined the hypothesis that the retinol so released is transferred to apo-CRBP by a membrane dependent mechanism. To do so, a new assay system involving the isolation of affinity-tagged recombinant CRBP has been developed. Using this assay, we demonstrate that the transfer of [3H]retinol from RBP to CRBP is greatly facilitated by the presence of placental membranes (Table I) and is unaffected by other retinol-binding proteins such as serum albumin and β-lactoglobulin (Tables II and III). It is further suggested that the transfer of retinol occurs via the agency of specific RBP receptors, since this transfer is substantially reduced in receptor-deficient erythrocyte membranes, on denaturation of placental membrane proteins, on treatment with pCMBS which abolishes RBP-receptor interaction (Table I), and in competition with unlabeled RBP (Fig. 4). Since little specific retinol transfer was observed with erythrocyte membranes or when placental membranes were heat-treated, the transfer process was not mediated solely or substantially by membrane lipids. This is further supported by other experiments (Table III) which indicate limited release of retinol via the membrane in the absence of a retinol acceptor protein. Finally, since the studies were carried out on isolated membranes, the data also suggest that the transfer of retinol across the placental brush-border is unlikely to involve energy-dependent endocytosis. These studies also show that the transfer of retinol occurred only when apo-CRBP was used as the acceptor protein; the defatted forms of neither serum albumin nor β-lactoglobulin, both of which can bind retinol with high affinity, were able to substitute for apo-CRBP (Table III). This implies that a specific membrane-binding site for apo-CRBP might exist on the cytoplasmic phase of the membrane. Consistent with the hypothesis put forward before (19Sivaprasadarao A. Boudjelal M. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the holo-form of CRBP is ineffective in inducing the release of retinol from the receptor-bound RBP. The demonstration that a 15-kDa protein with retinol-binding property is associated with native placental membranes (Figs. 5 and 6) suggests that under physiological conditions, apo-CRBP might receive retinol via the RBP receptor at the membrane level. The association of CRBP with the plasma membranes has been previously reported by other workers (31Ottonello S. Petrucco S. Mariani G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3975-3981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Chen W.Y. James H.O. Glover J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1986; 14: 925-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Taken together, the evidence could be interpreted to suggest that the RBP receptor protein induces the release of retinol from circulating RBP and facilitates its transfer to the intracellular CRBP in a membrane-dependent manner. However, the mechanism by which the receptor mediates this transfer is not clear. X-ray crystallographic studies revealed that in RBP, retinol is situated in the binding pocket with its β-ionone ring deep inside and the terminal hydroxyl near the open end (17Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. Aqvist J. Sundelin J. Eriksson U. Rask L. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1451-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). By contrast, in CRBP the orientation of the ligand in the binding pocket is opposite to that in RBP (18Cowan W.S. Newcomer M.E. Jones A.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1225-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). More recently, mutagenesis study has shown that RBP interacts with the receptor with the loops that make up the entrance/exit site of retinol, thereby perhaps facilitating direct release of ligand to the transfer mechanism. This is followed by the loss of, or reduction in, the affinity of the receptor for RBP (6Sivaprasadarao A. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 561-569PubMed Google Scholar, 33Rask L. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6360-6366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exact process by which the receptor facilitates the subsequent transfer of retinol to CRBP, however, has yet to be elucidated. One possibility is that the receptor, either on its own, or with associated but as yet unidentified protein(s), might form the transmembrane machinery through which retinol is transported into the binding pocket of CRBP, with the hydroxyl group leading the way. Such a mechanism would place the retinol in CRBP in the correct orientation. This would require CRBP to interact directly with the cytoplasmic side of the transport mechanism with the loops near the entrance to its ligand binding pocket. Final proof for such a mechanism awaits reconstitution experiments using the purified receptor (15Sivaprasadarao A. Boudjelal M. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Whether the transport system proposed here is unique to retinol or may represent one member of a new large family of related processes designed for efficient handling of hydrophobic materials or substances required in only small quantities by eukaryotic cells, remains to be established. Certainly, there are suggestions that some fatty acids may utilize a related mechanism."

A pig sperm protein that binds to the extracellular matrix of the egg in a species-specific manner was recently identified and named zonadhesin (Hardy, D. M., and Garbers, D. L. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 26025–26028). We have now cloned a cDNA for mouse zonadhesin (16.4 kb), and it demonstrates a large species variation in the numbers and arrangements of domains. Expression of mouse zonadhesin mRNA is evident only within the testis, and the protein is found exclusively on the apical region of the sperm head. There are 20 partial D-domains, found as tandem repeats, inserted between two of the four full D-domains and an additional partial D-domain. These domains are homologous to the D-domains of von Willebrand factor and α-tectorin. A region at the N terminus of the mouse cDNA contains three tandem repeats homologous to MAM domains. These are domains comprised of about 160 amino acids that are present in transmembrane proteins such as the meprins and receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatases, where they appear to function in cell/cell interactions. Additionally, mouse zonadhesin contains a mucin-like domain and a domain homologous to epidermal growth factor (EGF). A putative single transmembrane segment separates a short carboxyl tail from the extracellular region. The existence of MAM, mucin, D-, and EGF domains suggest that mouse zonadhesin functions in multiple cell adhesion processes, where binding to the extracellular matrix of the egg is but one of the functions of this sperm-specific membrane protein.

Prior to fertilization, the sperm cell interacts with multiple cells including fellow sperm cells, Sertoli cells, epithelial cells within the male reproductive tract or female reproductive tract, cells associated with the egg, and the egg itself. In some cases, the interactions are attractive in nature and in others repulsive. In an attempt to identify sperm proteins that bind to the egg extracellular matrix, Hardy and Garbers (1Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26025-26028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) solubilized sperm membranes from the pig and determined which proteins bound to the pig zona pellucida. Subsequently, the cDNA encoding a protein that bound to the zona pellucida in a relatively species-specific manner was cloned and named zonadhesin (2Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19000-19004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pig zonadhesin is a transmembrane protein with a very short intracellular region. The putative extracellular region contains a mucin-like domain and five tandem repeats homologous to the D-domains of prepro-von Willebrand factor (ppvWF) 1The abbreviations used are: ppvWF, prepro-von Willebrand factor; kb, kilobase(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DFP, diisopropyl fluorophosphate; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ZP, zona pellucida; t-PA, tissue plasminogen activator; u-PA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator.

EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The cloning of the pig sperm zonadhesin cDNA raised the questions of whether other species would contain homologs of zonadhesin and, if so, whether these would be variable within the above domain structure. Here, the mouse homolog of zonadhesin is cloned and shown to contain additional repetitive sequences within the D-domain region. Furthermore, three tandem repeats of a MAM domain were identified at the N terminus. The MAM domain is a module composed of about 160 amino acids including four conserved Cys; it is found in a number of functionally diverse transmembrane proteins such as the meprins and receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatases (5Takagi S. Hirata T. Agata K. Mochii M. Eguchi G. Fujisawa H. Neuron. 1991; 7: 295-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Thus, zonadhesin displays a large species variation between pig and mouse and also contains multiple domains previously suggested as involved in cell adhesion processes. Total RNA was isolated from 40 mouse testes or similar amounts of other mouse tissues (including brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, small intestine, and spleen) in guanidinium thiocyanate and N-lauroyl sarcosine, followed by extraction with acidic phenol/CHCl3 and precipitation with isopropyl alcohol (6Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from total RNA by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography (7Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Publishing Co., New York1986: 139-142Crossref Google Scholar). 30 μg of total RNA from various mouse tissues was loaded on each lane of a formaldehyde-agarose gel (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.T. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.43-7.50Google Scholar) and blotted overnight using 10 × SSC as the transfer buffer. The blot was then fixed by UV light and hybridized with a random primer-labeled (Amersham Life Science, Inc.), 1.4-kb probe from the 3′-end of the mouse zonadhesin cDNA as described previously (1Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26025-26028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). After hybridization, the blot was washed with 0.2 × SSC and 0.2% SDS at 65 °C. The first mouse cDNA clone (#18) was obtained by a low stringency screening of a mouse testis cDNA library (Stratagene) using a cDNA fragment corresponding to the pig zonadhesin D4 domain as described previously (9Gao Z. Harumi T. Garbers D.L. Genomics. 1997; 41: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The same cDNA library was further screened with the mouse cDNA clone #18 as a probe under previously described conditions (1Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26025-26028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The positive phage clones were converted to pBluescript plasmid by phage rescue and sequenced. The longest clone contained a 2.5-kb cDNA fragment. To obtain additional 5′-end sequence, 2 μg of mouse testis mRNA was used to construct an oligo-(dT) primed plasmid cDNA library using SUPERSCRIPTTM Plasmid System (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA was ligated into a pSPORT1 vector and transformed into DH10B cells by electroporation according to the manufacturer instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA library was screened using a combination of inverse and anchor PCR. Inverse PCR was carried out with two gene-specific primers, a 5′-end antisense primer and a 3′-end sense primer. The ExpandTM Long Template PCR kit (Boehringer Mannheim) was used with an Ericomp Twinblock System thermal cycler. The inverse PCR reaction was performed by denaturing at 95 °C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 92 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min and extension at 68 °C for 6 min. The PCR product was diluted 100-fold before use as a template for anchor PCR. Anchor PCR was performed using a sequence (5′-ATTACGCGCTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGG-3′) on the vector pSPORT1 as the sense primer and a gene-specific primer, upstream of the 5′-end antisense primer used in the inverse PCR, as the antisense primer. The anchor PCR reaction was performed using an air thermal cycler (Idaho Technologies) by denaturing at 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 0 s, annealing at 55 °C for 0 s, and extension at 68 °C for 1 min. A mixture of Taq and Pfu (9:1) was used as polymerases for the anchor PCR (10Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2216-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar) in a standard PCR reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 μm primers, and 0.2 mm dNTPs). PCR products were then purified on a 1% agarose gel and subcloned into a TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). The above process of combination of inverse and anchor PCR was repeatedly performed until no additional sequence could be obtained from the library. A total of an additional 6-kb composite sequence of cDNA was obtained. To obtain the full-length sequence of mouse zonadhesin, gene-specific reverse transcriptions (RT) and 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) were performed using the MarathonTM cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). 2 μg of mRNA was used for synthesis of cDNA according to the manufacturer instructions. Gene-specific primers 5′-AGCCCCATCGAACGTCAGGTAGTG-3′ and 5′-ATGCCATCTGACTTCAGGTTGTCG-3′ were used for the first and second gene-specific reverse transcriptions, separately. RACE-PCR was carried out by nested PCR with two sets of primer pairs, each of them containing one gene specific primer and one adapter primer of the MarathonTM cDNA amplification kit. The RACE-PCR product was diluted 100-fold before use as a template for the nested PCR. The AdvantageTM PCR kit (CLONTECH) was used for the RACE-PCR reactions. RACE-PCR reactions were performed by denaturing at 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 0 s, annealing at 55 °C for 0 s, and extension at 68 °C for 1 min. PCR products were then purified on a 1% agarose gel and subcloned into a TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). An additional 7-kb composite sequence of cDNA was obtained by these methods. The plasmid pGEX-KG (11Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar) was used to express GST-D3c or GST-D3p17 fusion proteins, in which D3c represented the C terminus of the D3 domain while D3p17 was the 17th D3 partial domain of zonadhesin (see Fig. 1). Primer pairs containing an EcoRI site at the 5′-end of the sense primer and a HindIII site at the 3′-end of the antisense primer were used so that PCR products could be subcloned into the pGEX-KG vector in the correct reading frame. PCR reactions were performed using an air thermal cycler (Idaho Technologies) under the following conditions: 1 cycle of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min; 1 cycle of denaturation at 94 °C for 0 s, annealing at 55 °C for 0 s, and extension at 68 °C for 1 min; 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 0 s, annealing and extension at 68 °C for 1 min; and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 2 min. PCR products were then separated on a 1% agarose gel, and DNA bands were purified using the QIAEX method (Qiagen). The purified PCR products were digested overnight with a mixture of EcoRI and HindIII in the core buffer of Promega, prior to ligation into EcoRI/HindIII-linearized pGEX-KG vector and subsequent transformation into DH5α bacteria. Recombinants were selected on ampicillin/LB plates. The sequences of the subcloned D3c and D3p17 products were confirmed before purification of the fusion proteins of GST-D3c and GST-D3p17. The purification of bacterial expressed GST fusion proteins was performed according to Li et al. (12Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G. Brose N. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins, expressed in bacterial strain DH5α, were purified in brief as follows: 50 ml of overnight culture was inoculated into 1 liter of LB and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C before adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (50 μm) and incubation at room temperature for another 8 h. The culture was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 30 min, and the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 10 mg/ml of lysozyme, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture composed of 1 mm EDTA, 1 μmleupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 4 mm Pefabloc SC (Boehringer Mannheim) and lysed by sonication on ice. Sonication was performed using a microtip at output scale 7 for 3 × 30 s with 2-min intervals. After centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 0.5 h, the supernatant fluid was transferred to a 50-ml tube and incubated with 1 ml of 50% glutathione-agarose beads on a rocker overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with 40 ml of cold PBS, and the GST fusion protein was eluted with 4 × 1 ml of freshly made 10 mm reduced glutathione (in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) (Sigma). The purity and concentrations of the purified proteins were examined by SDS-PAGE. 15 ml of preimmune serum was collected from each rabbit before injection of antigens. 1 ml of 0.2 mg/ml GST-D3c or GST-D3p17 fusion protein was mixed with 1 ml of complete adjuvant (Difco). Booster injection was once at Day 14 with a mixture of 500 μl of 0.2 mg/ml fusion protein and 500 μl of incomplete adjuvant (Sigma). 15 ml of blood was collected from each rabbit after another 2 weeks and stored at 4 °C overnight. Antisera were separated from blood cells by centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 10 min and were then stored at −80 °C as 1-ml aliquots. The preparation of mouse sperm membrane protein was based on Hardy et al. (2Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19000-19004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Bleil et al. (13Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5563-5567Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) with modifications. 40 male mice (ICR) were used for one preparation. Caudal epididymal and vas deferens were dissected from the mice, transferred to 2 ml of pre-warmed (37 °C) Earle's modified medium 199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 4 mg/ml BSA, 30 μg/ml pyruvate, and 4 mmEGTA (M199-ME), covered with mineral oil, and then minced with a scissors and placed in a cell culture incubator for 10 min. The spermatozoa were transferred to 30 ml of M199-ME and capacitated at 37 °C for 1 h. The spermatozoa were then centrifuged down at 1500 × g for 15 min and resuspended in 25 ml of ice-cold HE/diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) buffer (50 mmNaHEPES, 1 mm NaEDTA, 1 mm DFP, pH 7.5) before being transferred to a Parr Bomb (30 ml) for N2 cavitation at 0 °C and 650 p.s.i. for 30 min. Disrupted cells were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant fluid was centrifuged again at 51,000 rpm (Beckman Ti-70) for 45 min. The crude membrane pellet was resuspended in 5-ml of ice-cold HE/DFP, and washed twice by centrifugation at 100,000 rpm (TL-100.3 rotor) for 20 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold HE/DFP, sheared with 18–30-gauge needles, and stored at −20 °C in a 100-μl aliquot. The concentration of the isolated sperm membrane was determined as 4 mg/ml by the BCA assay. 100 μl of 4 mg/ml sperm membrane protein was mixed with 100 μl of 2% CHAPS in 300 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmleupeptin, 1 mm pepstatin, and 4 mm Pefabloc SC and rocked at 4 °C for 1 h before centrifugation at 100,000 rpm (TL-100.2 rotor) for 15 min. The supernatant fluid was transferred to a new tube and stored at −20 °C. A 4–12% polyacrylamide gel (NOVEXTM) was used for protein analysis. Solubilized sperm membrane proteins (5 μl) were mixed with equivalent amounts of modified 2 × sample buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and heated at 65 °C for 5 min before being loaded on a gel. Electrophoresis was performed at 60 volts for 5–10 h before blotting to nitrocellulose at 25 volts overnight at 4 °C. The blot was then air dried and washed twice in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and once in TBST containing 100 mg/ml BSA before incubation with 1:10000 diluted, purified antibody S117 (against GST-D3c) for 1 h. The blot was then washed three times in 10 ml of TBST for 15 min each and incubated with 1:20000 diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Biosource) for another 1 h followed by washing three times in TBST. The peroxidase activity was detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Life Science, Inc.). Spermatozoa were collected in 200 μl of M199-ME medium (M199 with Earle's salts, 30 μg/ml pyruvic acid, 4 mg/ml BSA, and 1 mm EDTA) (13Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5563-5567Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) from the caudal epididymis and washed twice with 15 ml of PBS by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. Sperm cells were then fixed either in a 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS solution or in 100% methanol. The fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde was performed on ice for 30 min followed by washing twice with 40 ml of PBS. After incubating in a 0.1m glycine/PBS solution overnight at 4 °C, samples were washed in PBS twice before being smeared on slides. When fixed in methanol, sperm cells were directly smeared on slides and air dried. The slides were then placed in ice-cold methanol for 30 min followed by washing in 100% ethanol for 10 min before the immunofluorescence assay. 300 μl of blocking reagent (10% goat serum and 1 mm EDTA in PBS) was incubated with spermatozoa on a slide at room temperature for 30 min. Antisera P448 against GST-D3p17 fusion protein or S117 against GST-D3c were diluted in 300 μl of blocking reagent at a ratio of 1:50 to 1:200 and then placed on the samples and incubated in a moisture chamber overnight. The slides were washed in 500 ml of PBS for 10 min before incubation with 300 μl of 1:200 to 1:500 diluted Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody for 60 min at room temperature. The slides were washed in 500 ml of PBS for 10 min before being mounted with Fluoromont G. Pictures were taken with double exposures of fluorescence and Nomarski. The finding of a pig sperm protein that bound to the egg extracellular matrix in an apparently species-specific manner raised the important questions of whether homologs of this protein would exist in other species and, if so, if they would display significant species variation in structure. A mouse testis cDNA library was initially screened at low stringency with a 3′ fragment of the pig zonadhesin cDNA. Three clones were obtained, the largest being 1.2 kb. By use of the 1.2-kb fragment from mouse, a larger clone of 2.5 kb was then obtained from the same testis cDNA library (Fig. 1, Phage cDNA library). To obtain the 5′-sequence, an oligo(dT)-primed plasmid cDNA library was synthesized as described above, and a combination of inverse and anchor PCRs was used to screen the plasmid cDNA library. A combination of inverse/anchor PCRs instead of nest/anchor PCRs was used since the two gene-specific primers in the inverse PCR significantly increased PCR reaction specificity. In many cases, multiple bands were detected on agarose gels after anchor PCR, and each band was cloned separately into a TA cloning vector. Sequence comparisons of these subclones showed that they shared the same 3′-sequence with different 5′-sequences. By these methods, the majority of the cDNA sequence was obtained (Fig. 1). Gene-specific reverse transcriptions and 5′-RACE were then performed to obtain the last 7 kb of mouse zonadhesin cDNA. We did two reverse transcription reactions with the gene-specific primers described above, followed by nested 5′-RACE-PCR. The nested 5′-RACE-PCR was repeated until new sequence was undetectable from the products of reverse transcriptions. By the use of nested 5′-RACE-PCR, we obtained a 4-kb composite sequence of cDNA from the first reverse transcription product and a 3.5-kb from the second. Again, we cloned each band on agarose gels from PCR reactions to confirm sequences. The criteria we used that we had obtained the full-length cDNA were as follows. First, the predicted initiation Met coincided with a Kozak consensus sequence (14Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). Second, an apparent signal peptide followed the proposed Met (15von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3694) Google Scholar). Third, all three reading frames upstream of the proposed initiation codon contained at least one stop codon. Fourth, as shown below, the size of the mRNA from Northern blots closely matched the size of the cDNA clone. The 16,380 base composite sequence of cDNA contains a single major open reading frame of 16,131 bases with a deduced protein sequence of 5376 amino acids. A 17-amino acid putative signal peptide (15von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3694) Google Scholar) is present at the N terminus of the deduced sequence (Fig. 2). The sequence also predicts a 5293-amino acid extracellular region, a single transmembrane segment, and a 39-amino acid intracellular C terminus with 30% basic residues. Cleavage of the putative signal peptide at Gly17 would produce a 5359-amino acid mature polypeptide chain with a calculated molecular mass of ∼578,000 Da (Fig. 2). Mouse zonadhesin has 40 potential N-linked glycosylation sites (NXT/S) and a large number of potential O-linked glycosylation sites. Like pig zonadhesin, mRNA of mouse zonadhesin is only detectable in testis, but the 16–17-kb mRNA is about twice as large (Fig. 3 A). The localization of zonadhesin is of particular importance since 1) the predicted structure to be discussed below suggests zonadhesin is a transmembrane protein, and 2) zonadhesin contains multiple extracellular domains, suggesting it potentially functions in multiple cell/cell interactions. By the use of antibodies (S117 or P448) generated to zonadhesin fusion proteins, expression was demonstrated as exclusively on the apical region of the sperm head (Fig. 3 B), regardless of whether methanol- or paraformaldehyde-fixed sperm cells were used. The localization is consistent with zonadhesin interacting with the extracellular matrix of the egg or with other cells and also supports the model of it as a transmembrane protein. Zonadhesin was processed on mature and capacitated sperm cells as evidenced through detection with antiserum S117 on a Western blot (Fig. 3 C). One band at 100 kDa and two major bands between 200 and ∼250 kDa are seen on non-reducing SDS-PAGE. The reason that S117 recognized three bands on the gel is very likely due to the high sequence similarities between the D3 partial domains. Processing of the pig zonadhesin also occurred, yielding 45 and 105 kDa mass proteins on reducing SDS-PAGE (2Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19000-19004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The processing of zonadhesin and its relationship to function is not yet known, but presumably the unprocessed forms function prior to encountering the egg. Analysis of the sequence of mouse zonadhesin revealed that it contained the domains present in the pig zonadhesin, including MAM domains (see below), a mucin-like domain, D-domains, an EGF-like domain, a transmembrane segment, and a short intracellular region. The similarity of the primary amino acid sequence within each domain (see below) together with Northern blot and cytoimmunofluorescence data strongly indicate that the composite cDNA sequence we obtained from mouse testis is a homolog of pig zonadhesin. Mouse zonadhesin contains three tandem repeats of a domain known as the MAM domain, a new finding that strongly suggests a role for this region of zonadhesin in cell-cell interactions. Subsequently, we found that pig zonadhesin also contains one full and one partial MAM domain (Fig. 4). A MAM domain contains about 160 amino acids and four conserved cysteine residues, as well as conserved hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids (Fig. 5). The MAM domain is suggested to function in cell adhesion and is found in a diverse number of membrane proteins including meprins (16Jiang W. Gorbea C.M. Flannery A.V. Beynon R.J. Grant G.A. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9185-9193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), A5 protein (17Beckmann G. Bork P. Trends Biochem.

The MAM-bearing meprins are zinc-metalloproteases that contain α- and β-subunits (16Jiang W. Gorbea C.M. Flannery A.V. Beynon R.J. Grant G.A. Bond J.S. J. Biol.

Agata K. Mochii M. Eguchi G. Fujisawa H. Neuron. 1991; 7: 295-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). A5 protein is a developmentally regulated cell surface molecule involved in neurite outgrowth or axonal guidance, and its MAM domain is critical for cell-cell interactions (5Takagi S. Hirata T. Agata K. Mochii M. Eguchi G. Fujisawa H. Neuron. 1991; 7: 295-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Some of the receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase family members, such as RPTPμ, RPTPκ, RPTPψ, and PCP-2, contain MAM domains, where they have been suggested as essential for homophilic cell-cell interaction and the specificity of those interactions (5Takagi S.

Another MAM-containing protein (gene B product) from Xenopus has been reported by Brown et al. (22Brown D.D. Wang Z. Furlow J.D. Kanamori A. Schwartzman R.A. Remo B.F. Pinder A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1924-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The function of this MAM-containing protein is unknown, but the protein is induced by thyroid hormone during Xenopus laevis metamorphosis (22Brown D.D. Wang Z. Furlow J.D. Kanamori A. Schwartzman R.A. Remo B.F. Pinder A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1924-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there is much higher sequence similarity within the MAM domains of a given protein group, suggesting slightly different functions within the different protein groups. The function of the MAM domains of zonadhesin is not known, but since this region can be eliminated by proteolysis with retention of zona pellucida binding properties (1Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26025-26028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 2Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2141459857,"SNAP-23 is the ubiquitously expressed homologue of the neuronal SNAP-25, which functions in synaptic vesicle fusion. We have investigated the subcellular localization of SNAP-23 in polarized epithelial cells. In hepatocyte-derived HepG2 cells and in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, the majority of SNAP-23 was present at both the basolateral and apical plasma membrane domains with little intracellular localization. This suggests that SNAP-23 does not function in intracellular fusion events but rather as a general plasma membrane t-SNARE. Canine SNAP-23 is efficiently cleaved by the botulinum neurotoxin E, suggesting that it is the toxin-sensitive factor previously found to be involved in plasma membrane fusion in MDCK cells. The localization of SNAP-25 in transfected MDCK cells was studied for comparison and was found to be identical to SNAP-23 with the exception that SNAP-25 was transported to the primary cilia protruding from the apical plasma membrane, which suggests that subtle differences in the targeting signals of both proteins exist. In contrast to its behavior in neurons, the distribution of SNAP-25 in MDCK cells remained unaltered by treatment with dibutyryl cAMP or forskolin, which, however, caused an increased growth of the primary cilia. Finally, we found that SNAP-23/25 and syntaxin 1A, when co-expressed in MDCK cells, do not stably interact with each other but are independently targeted to the plasma membrane and lysosomes, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2061612474,"A new family of neuronal survival factors comprised of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin has recently been described (Kotzbauer, P. T., Lampe, P. A., Heuckeroth, R. O., Golden, J. P., Creedon, D. J., Johnson, E. M., Jr., and Milbrandt, J. (1997) Nature 384, 467–470). These molecules, which are related to transforming growth factor-β, are important in embryogenesis and in the survival of distinct neuronal populations. These molecules signal through a novel receptor system that includes the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase, a ligand (i.e. GDNF or neurturin), and an accessory glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked molecule that is responsible for high affinity binding of the ligand. Two accessory molecules denoted GDNF family receptor 1 and 2 (GFRα-1 and GFRα-2) have been described that function in GDNF and neurturin signaling complexes. We have identified a novel co-receptor belonging to this family based on similarity to GFRα-1, which we have named GFRα-3. GFRα-3 displays 33% amino acid identity with GFRα-1 and 36% identity with GFRα-2. Despite the similarity of GFRα-3 to GFRα-1 and GFRα-2, it is unable to activate Ret in conjunction with GDNF, suggesting that there are likely additional undiscovered ligands and/or Ret-like receptors to be identified. GFRα-3 is anchored to the cell membrane by a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-resistant glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage. GFRα-3 is highly expressed by embryonic day 11 but is not appreciably expressed in the adult mouse. In situ hybridization analyses demonstrate that GFRα-3 is located in dorsal root ganglia and the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion. Comparison of the expression patterns of GFRα-3 and Ret suggests that these molecules could form a receptor pair and interact with GDNF family members to play unique roles in development. A new family of neuronal survival factors comprised of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin has recently been described (Kotzbauer, P. T., Lampe, P. A., Heuckeroth, R.

Together these molecules have established the existence of a new family of neuronal survival factors displaying similarity to transforming growth factor-β (20% sequence identity). Structurally, GDNF and NTN contain a Cys knot motif that is also present in nerve growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and transforming growth factor-β family members. This motif consists of six Cys residues that form three intramolecular disulfide linkages between parallel β-sheets (8McDonald N.Q. Hendrickson W.A.

The high degree of sequence conservation between GDNF and NTN (42% sequence identity) as well as the conservation of the Cys knot motif suggests that these molecules would serve as ligands for related receptors.

This is unique in that the specificity of the tripartite signaling complex can be controlled either by the choice of co-receptor or by the local concentration of a particular ligand. Here we report the identification and characterization of a new GFRα family member that we have named GFRα-3. Expression profiles of this molecule suggest that it is very important in embryogenesis, particularly in the nervous system. The existence of several family members and their differential expression patterns raises the possibility that this tripartite receptor/ligand system is a paradigm utilized in many tissues during development. A mouse expressed sequence tag data base clone encoding GFRα-3 (Image consortium; accession number AA050083) was sequenced and analyzed. A mistake in the image consortium clone that generated a premature stop codon in the coding sequence was identified by sequencing multiple polymerase chain reaction products obtained from a mouse fetal brain library using primers based on the expressed sequence tag sequence. This base was corrected using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Alignment was performed using the Clustal W program (MacVector). COS and 293 cells were grown in a 5% CO2 environment using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine (293 cells only), penicillin, and streptomycin. Subconfluent 293 or COS cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 8 μg of the DNA construct of interest using LipofectAMINE reagent (50 μl) as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). NB41A3 cells were grown in a 6% CO2 environment using Ham's F-10 supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Subconfluent NB41A3 cells in 35-mm dishes were transfected using a total of 2 μg of DNA and 4 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent for 10 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested by scraping, pelleted at 250 × g for 10 min, and resuspended in 400 μl of 25 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The extracts were cleared of cell debris by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 5 min. The luciferase assay was performed as described by Brasier et al. (26Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar) using the same amount of protein for each sample. NB41A3 cells were grown in 60-mm dishes and transfected with 6 μg of vector (pcDNA3) or GFRα-1 and GFRα-3 pcDNA3 expression constructs using 12 μl of LipofectAMINE as described above. Samples were treated with 100 ng/ml GDNF for 5 min at room temperature prior to harvesting. Immune precipitation with the Ret polyclonal antibody was performed as described (29Worby C.A. Vega Q.C.

Samples were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to Immobilon (Millipore), and immunoblotted with phosphotyrosine antibody (1:10,000; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or Ret antibody (1:500) as described (29Worby C.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23619-23622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). 293 cells were transiently transfected with Flag-tagged GFRα-1 and GFRα-3 expression constructions as described above. Cells recovered for 48 h, were harvested in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, and treated with 1 unit of phospholipase C (Boehringer Mannheim) for 30 min at 37 °C. After pelleting, the medium was collected (1 ml) for immune precipitation, and the cells were lysed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethlysulfonyl fluoride. Both were subjected to immune precipitation as described using Flag M2 affinity gel (Eastman Kodak Company) (11Vega Q.C. Worby C.A. Lechner M.S. Dixon J.E. Dressler G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10657-10661Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The resulting samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon. Western analysis was performed with Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (1:2500; Eastman Kodak Company) in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2), 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk. Horseradish peroxidase protein A (Amersham Corp.) was used at a 1:5000 dilution in the above buffer, and the antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (National Diagnostics). COS cells were transfected with the Flag-tagged GFRα-3 construct as described above. Two days post-transfection, cells were washed three times with Ringer's solution (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 154 mm NaCl, 7.2 mm KCl and 1.8 mm CaCl2) and incubated with 2 ml of 200 μg/ml EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C. Following the biotin incubation, the cells were washed five times with Tris saline (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl), and the cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethlysulfonyl fluoride. Immunoprecipitations were performed using the Flag M2 antibody (4 μg) followed by incubation with protein A-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.). The resulting samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon (Millipore). Western analysis was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:500; Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, and 2% bovine serum albumin. Horseradish peroxidase protein A (Amersham Corp.) was used at a 1:5,000 dilution in the above buffer, and the antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (National Diagnostics). 293 cells (2 × 106 cells) were transfected as described above with constructs encoding either Flag-tagged GFRα-1, a transmembrane version of Flag-tagged GFRα-1, or Flag-tagged GFRα-3. After an overnight recovery period, cells were incubated with [2-14C]ethan-1-ol-2-amine HCl (100 μCi/4 ml, 50–62 mCi/mmol, CFA 329, Amersham Corp.) for 18 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. The cells were harvested and subjected to immune precipitation as described above. A portion of the samples was used for Western analysis as described previously, and the remainder was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fixing in 10% acetic acid and fluorography with Amplify™ (Amersham Corp.). The film was exposed at −80 °C for 24 h. For the cell lines, 20 μg of total RNA was run on a 1% denaturing agarose gel, transferred to Hybond N (Amersham Corp.) and probed with the appropriately labeled cDNA. Both the multi-tissue Northern and developmental Northern were purchased (CLONTECH) and probed with the appropriately labeled DNA. A partial cDNA fragment of the mouse RET proto-oncogene was cloned by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from Neuro 2A RNA using oligonucleotides corresponding to the murine cDNA sequence between nucleotide 361 and nucleotide 690. The fragment was subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega), and the plasmid was linearized withNcoI. Mouse GFRα-3 was obtained from the image consortium, and a PstI fragment was cloned into pJCC (modified pBluescript, Stratagene). The construct was linearized withNotI. For all of the above constructs, sense and antisense probes were made using T7 or T3 RNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and [33P]UTP (NEN Life Science Products) (27Keegan C.E. Herman J.P. Karolyi I.J. O'Shea K.S. Camper S.A. Seasholtz A.F. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2547-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For the hybridization, embryos of E14.5 were frozen in 2-methylbutane and stored at −80 °C. Frozen embryos were cryostat sectioned (20 μm), and in situ hybridization was performed as described previously (27Keegan C.E. Herman J.P. Karolyi I.J. O'Shea K.S. Camper S.A. Seasholtz A.F. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2547-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). GFRα-3 was identified by a BLAST search (28Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70758) Google Scholar) of the expressed sequence tag data base performed using blocks of GFRα-1 amino acid sequences that contained multiple Cys residues. We reasoned that the placement of these Cys residues would be highly conserved among GFRα-1-related molecules. The expressed sequence tag clone (Image consortium; accession number AA050083) obtained was derived from 13.5–14.5-day-old mouse embryos and was sequenced in its entirety (Fig. 1). The full-length cDNA contains an open reading frame of 397 amino acids that contains a hydrophobic signal peptide as well as a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids at its COOH terminus that comprises a putative GPI linkage sequence or membrane attachment sequence. It also contains three potentialN-linked glycosylation sites that are represented by the sequence Asn-Xaa-(Thr/Ser). GFRα-3 shares lower amino acid identity with GFRα-1 and GFRα-2 (33 and 36%, respectively) than that seen between GFRα-1 and GFRα-2 (48%) (Fig. 2). In addition to the lower amino acid identity, GFRα-3 contains only 28 Cys residues as compared with 31 and 30 Cys residues for GFRα-1 and GFRα-2, respectively. However, the positions of all 28 Cys residues are conserved among the other family members. This analysis suggests that although GFRα-3 belongs to the GFRα family, it is a more distant relative. Because both GFRα-1 and GFRα-2 can form functional signaling complexes with Ret upon addition of GDNF, we sought to determine whether GFRα-3 and GDNF could form a functional signaling complex with Ret. Previously we determined that activated Ret signals via the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway using the Gal-Elk/GAL-Luc reporter system (29Worby C.A. Vega Q.C. Zhao Y. Chao H.H.-J. Seasholtz A.F. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23619-23622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). NB41A3 mouse neuroblastoma cells express Ret but require the addition of either GFRα-1 or GFRα-2 in conjunction with GDNF to activate Ret (12Sanicola M. Hession C. Worley D. Carmillo P. Ehrenfels C. Walus L. Robinson S. Jaworski G. Wei H. Tizard R. Whitty A. Pepinsky R.B. Cate R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6238-6243Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). When GFRα-1 is transiently introduced into these cells with the Gal-Elk reporter system, GDNF is able to elicit a 4.5-fold induction of reporter activity. Neither vector alone (pcDNA3) nor GFRα-3 is able to increase reporter activity (Fig. 3 A). In addition, transient expression of GFRα-1 in NB41A3 cells treated with GDNF results in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Ret, whereas expression of GFRα-3 does not (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, despite the conservation of this co-receptor family, only GFRα-1 and GFRα-2 are able to use GDNF to activate Ret. However, GFRα-3 can be co-immunoprecipitated with Ret when both molecules are transiently expressed in 293 cells (data not shown). This implies that GFRα-3 and Ret most likely will form a functional signaling complex in the presence of the appropriate ligand. Both GFRα-1 and GFRα-2 possess the characteristic carboxyl-terminal features of GPI-linked proteins in that they have a COOH-terminal hydrophobic domain separated by a hydrophilic linker region from a cleavage consensus sequence for GPI linkage, i.e. Ala-Ser-Ser for GFRα-1 and Gly-Ser-Asn for GFRα-2 (13Buj-Bello A. Adu J. Pinon L.G.P. Horton A. Thompson J. Rosenthal A. Chinchetru M. Buchman V.L. Davies A.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 30Ferguson M.A.J. Williams A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 285-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Because the carboxyl terminus of GFRα-3 varies significantly from the other family members, we sought to determine whether this molecule is secreted or attached to the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane via its hydrophobic tail or a GPI linkage. A common method to demonstrate whether a protein is linked to the membrane by a GPI linkage is its ability to be cleaved by PIPLC. In the following experiments, the co-receptors have been tagged with the Flag epitope on their amino termini for easy detection. As can be seen in Fig. 4 A, GFRα-3 unlike GFRα-1 cannot be removed from the membrane by treatment with PIPLC. GFRα-1 undergoes an apparent shift in molecular weight upon cleavage with PIPLC. This is because GFRα-1 expressed in 293 cells is present as a doublet that is not well separated in this gel system. The higher molecular weight species is the molecule that is concentrated in the medium after PIPLC cleavage. The lower molecular weight species is presumably in the process of being transported to the cell surface. To demonstrate that GFRα-3 is attached to the extracellular surface, cells expressing GFRα-3 were treated with EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-Biotin as described under “Materials and Methods.” The transfected cells contained a biotinylated protein immunoprecipitated with Flag antibody corresponding to the expected size of GFRα-3, demonstrating that this protein is indeed attached to the extracellular surface of the cells. However, these experiments do not allow us to predict whether it is attached via a GPI linkage or by insertion of its hydrophobic tail because resistance to PIPLC has been demonstrated for several GPI-linked proteins including erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase. This protein contains a modified inositol group in its anchor conferring resistance to PIPLC (31Roberts W.L. Kim B.H. Rosenberry T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7817-7821Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Chemical analyses of membrane anchors have determined that they are glycophospholipid units containing ethanolamine, mannose, glucosamine, phosphatidylinositol, and occasionally galactose. Fatemi et al. (32Fatemi S.H. Haas R. Jentoft N. Rosenberry T.L. Tartakoff A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4728-4732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the GPI-linked protein Thy-1 can be effectively labeled with [3H]ethanolamine. When cells transfected with Flag-tagged GFRα-1, a transmembrane form of GFRα-1, and GFRα-3 are incubated in the presence of [14C]ethanolamine, GFRα-1 and GFRα-3 are both effectively labeled (Fig. 4 C). All three proteins are expressed to equivalent levels as depicted by the Western analysis of these proteins shown in Fig. 4 D. Therefore, GFRα-3 is a GPI-linked protein that is insensitive to cleavage by PIPLC. This does not rule out the possibility that other lipases such as phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D may be used to remove this molecule from the membrane. Resistance to PIPLC could result from inaccessibility of the cleavage site in situ as is the case for the GPI-linked variant surface glycoproteins on intact trypanosomes (33Low M.G. Ferguson M.A.J. Futerman A.H. Silman I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 212-215Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Alternatively, as described above, the anchor can be modified to prevent cleavage. The biological significance of this unusual anchoring mechanism for this family of co-receptors is not known. However, because GFRα-1 (25Jing S. Wen D. Yu Y. Holst P.L. Luo Y. Fang M. Tamir R. Antonio L. Hu Z. Cupples R. Louis J.-C. Hu S. Altrock B.W. Fox G.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 1113-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar) and GFRα-2 (13Buj-Bello A. Adu J. Pinon L.G.P. Horton A. Thompson J. Rosenthal A. Chinchetru M. Buchman V.L. Davies A.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) can presumably be severed from the membrane with PIPLC, the reversibility of this mode of attachment may be critical for their biological function. Because GFRα-3 cannot be efficiently removed from the membrane using this enzyme, it may signal via an alternative mechanism (see Fig. 7).Figure 7Schematic diagram of potential Ret signaling mechanisms. A, receptor signaling with the co-receptor and receptor expressed on the same cell. B, signaling with the co-receptor and ligand expressed on the same cell. The yellow diamonds represent GDNF-like molecules that interact with a member of the GFRα co-receptor family (blue). The co-receptor/ligand pair is then able to activate a Ret-like receptor (red).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The presence of an additional GFRα-1-like receptor raises the question of whether these molecules are redundant in their role of signaling. To address this question, we performed Northern analyses on cell lines known to express the RET receptor. RET is expressed in the neuroblastoma cell lines LA-N-1, LA-N-2, LA-N-5, SY5Y, and SK-N-SH but not in SK-N-MC cells (Fig. 5 A). Neither GFRα-1 nor GFRα-3 was found to be expressed in these cell lines either by Northern analysis (Fig. 5 A) or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (data not shown). In contrast, GFRα-2 was expressed in LA-N-1 and SK-N-SH cells and was particularly high in LA-N-2 and LA-N-5 cells (Fig. 5 A). Low levels were expressed in SY5Y cells, which were detectable by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (data not shown). Because RET is unable to bind GDNF in the absence of a GFRα-1-like molecule (24Treanor J.S. Goodman L. de Sauvage F. Stone D.M. Poulsen K.T. Beck C.D. Gray C. Armanini M.P. Pollock R.A. Hefti F.

Worby C.A. Lechner M.S. Dixon J.E. Dressler G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10657-10661Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 29Worby C.A. Vega Q.C. Zhao Y. Chao H.H.-J. Seasholtz A.F. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23619-23622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) suggests that GFRα-2 acts as a GDNF receptor and, upon binding GDNF, activates the RET receptor. A recent publication by Baloh et al. (14Baloh R.H. Tansey M.G. Golden J.P. Creedon D.J. Heuckeroth R.O. Keck C.L. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Johnson Jr., E.M. Milbrandt J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 793-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that this is indeed the case. GFRα-2 functions as a low affinity receptor for GDNF or as a high affinity receptor for neurturin both signaling in conjunction with the Ret receptor. Surprisingly none of our Ret expressing cell lines expressed GFRα-1 or GFRα-3. To further address the role of specific signaling by GFRα-3, we analyzed the expression of this molecule compared with that of GFRα-1 and GFRα-2 during mouse development. In embryogenesis, RET expression is seen beginning at E9 of mouse development. It continues throughout fetal development but is almost entirely absent in the adult animal (34Avantaggiato V. Dathan N.A. Grieco M. Fabien N. Lazzaro D. Fusco A. Simeone A. Santoro M. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 305-311PubMed Google Scholar). Northern analysis reveals that both GFRα-1 and GFRα-3 are expressed highly at E11 and drop off to lower levels by E17 (Fig. 5 B). GFRα-2, in contrast, is expressed at low levels at E11 with increased expression levels throughout development culminating with strong expression in adult mouse brain, spleen, lung, and liver (Fig. 5 C). GFRα-1 displays a more limited adult expression pattern because it is expressed only in liver and kidney, whereas GFRα-3 is not detected in any of the adult tissues tested. Ret expression in the adult mouse was reported in the brain, spinal cord, salivary gland, heart, spleen, and lymph nodes (35Iwamoto T. Taniguchi M. Asai N. Ohkusu K. Nakashima I. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1087-1091PubMed Google Scholar, 36Pachnis V. Mankoo B. Constantini F. Development. 1993; 119: 1005-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The disparate expression patterns of these molecules in the adult indicate that Ret may function alone, use another co-receptor or interact with its co-receptor in trans (2Trupp M. Belluardo N. Funakoshi H. Ibanez C.F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3554-3567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, additional Ret-like receptors may interact with these co-receptors in a cell-specific manner. It is also possible that adult tissues could respond to trauma and injury by up-regulating GFRα-3. In this way, the developmental state could be recapitulated, allowing regeneration of the afflicted tissues. To get a better understanding of the potential partners for GFRα-3 in the embryo, this molecule was localized by in situ analysis and compared with the expression pattern for Ret. Data in Fig. 6 A are consistent with previously reported results demonstrating that at E14 RET is expressed prominently in cranial ganglia, myenteric ganglia of the gut, motor neurons in the spinal cord and the hindbrain, the dorsal root ganglia, and the growing tips of the renal collecting ducts (34Avantaggiato V. Dathan N.A. Grieco M. Fabien N. Lazzaro D. Fusco A. Simeone A. Santoro M. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 305-311PubMed Google Scholar, 36Pachnis V. Mankoo B. Constantini F. Development. 1993; 119: 1005-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, GFRα-3 is expressed more selectively. At E14 GFRα-3 is expressed in subpopulations of cells in the dorsal root ganglia (data not shown), selected cranial ganglia, the superior cervical sympathetic ganglia, and regions in the lower urogenital and digestive tracts (Fig. 6 B). It is not present in detectable levels in the developing kidney. More similar to Ret, GFRα-1 is expressed widely in the developing embryo. It is present in the ventral midbrain, spinal cord motor neurons, subpopulations of the dorsal root ganglia, the developing kidney, the mesenchyme of the developing gut, the retina, the pituitary, urogenital tract, and pancreatic primordium (24Treanor J.S. Goodman L. de Sauvage F. Stone D.M. Poulsen K.T. Beck C.D. Gray C. Armanini M.P. Pollock R.A. Hefti F. Phillips H.S. Goddard A. Moore M.W. Buj-Bello A. Davies A.M. Asai N. Takahashi M. Vandlen R. Henderson C.E. Rosenthal A. Nature. 1996; 382: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Like GFRα-3, GFRα-2 is expressed less widely being found only in the developing and adult dorsal root ganglia and the superior cervical ganglion of the rat (14Baloh R.H. Tansey M.G. Golden J.P. Creedon D.J. Heuckeroth R.O. Keck C.L. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Johnson Jr., E.M. Milbrandt J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 793-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Therefore, the co-receptors in the GFRα family appear to maintain distinct tissue-specific expression that does not always overlap with Ret expression. This suggests that other Ret-like receptors or alternative signaling methods may be involved in GFRα-1-, GFRα-2-, and GFRα-3-dependent signaling. The ability of GFRα-1 and GFRα-2 but not GFRα-3 to be removed from the membrane via cleavage of a GPI linkage also implicates unique signaling mechanisms (Fig. 7). In cases where Ret and the co-receptor are expressed on the same cell, soluble ligand can diffuse to the cell, bind to the co-receptor, and activate Ret (Fig. 7 A). Alternatively, the ligand and co-receptor could be expressed on the same cell, be removed by cleavage of the GPI linkage, and travel as a pair to activate Ret on a nearby cell (Fig. 7 B). Because GFRα-3 cannot be removed by PIPLC cleavage, it may be expressed on the same cell as the Ret-like receptor to act as a co-receptor (Fig. 7 A). It will be of interest to determine if one signaling paradigm prevails over the other in development as well as in the mature organism. In conclusion, we have identified a novel member of the GFRα family of co-receptors and have demonstrated that a unique expression profile is observed for the GFRα family members. Based on the observations that the family of co-receptors is expressed in a nonredundant fashion, we propose that there are likely additional molecules related to RET and/or additional GDNF-like ligands. We also suggest that the tripartite receptor system exemplified by RET, GDNF, and GFRα-1 is used throughout development and in the mature animal in a tissue-specific manner. These systems use the classical components of a receptor-mediated system including a signaling receptor and a soluble ligand. However, they are distinct in that they include a GPI-linked protein that is thought to modulate the sensitivity of RET activation. Similar to the GDNF, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a survival factor for ciliary neurons, also requires a GPI-linked receptor, CNTFRα, for functional ligand induced formation of its tripartite receptor complex (37Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Stahl N. Pan L. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Ip N.Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1993; 260: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). This receptor complex is comprised of the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor binding protein LIFRβ and gp130, the signal transducer of interleukin 6 in conjunction with CNTFRα and CNTF. Interestingly, the bipartite leukemia inhibitory factor receptor is converted into a tripartite CNTF receptor by addition of the specificity conferring molecule, CNTFRα. The expression of CNTFRα predominantly in the nervous system limits CNTF to neuronal actions. Therefore, the tripartite receptor complex may be a common paradigm used in the nervous system to increase the fidelity of the specific signals for survival of various neuronal populations. Further studies are in progress to understand these novel receptor-mediated signaling systems and their involvement in neuronal development and survival.

https://openalex.org/W2022148565,"The major core protein of cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (p50) has been shown previously to inhibit protein synthesis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, p50 is highly homologous to the Y-box-binding transcription factor family of proteins, binds DNA containing the Y-box motif, and thus may have a dual function in cells as a regulator of both transcription and translation. Here we show that binding or removal of p50 from rabbit reticulocyte lysate by monospecific antibodies to p50 strongly inhibits translation of endogenous and exogenous globin mRNAs as well as prokaryotic β-galactosidase mRNA in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system. Thus, depending on the conditions, p50 not only may act as a translational repressor, but may also be required for protein synthesis. Translation inhibition with anti-p50 antibodies is not a result of mRNA degradation or its functional inactivation. The inhibition does not change the ribosome transit time, and therefore, it does not affect elongation/termination of polypeptide chains. The inhibition with anti-p50 antibodies is followed by a decay of polysomes and accumulation of the 48 S preinitiation complex. These results suggest that p50 participates in initiation of protein biosynthesis. Although uninvolved in the formation of the 48 S preinitiation complex, p50 is necessary either for attachment of the 60 S ribosomal subunit or for previous 5′-untranslated region scanning by the 43 S preinitiation complex.

Although uninvolved in the formation of the 48 S preinitiation complex, p50 is necessary either for attachment of the 60 S ribosomal subunit or for previous 5′-untranslated region scanning by the 43 S preinitiation complex. Regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes often involves modulating the rate of initiation of protein synthesis (for reviews, see Refs. 1Sonenberg N. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 2Hentze M.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 3Mathews M.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 505-539Google Scholar). Translation is controlled by proteins that are associated with mRNA and/or ribosomes and that either promote or repress the protein synthesis rate. One type of mechanism involves modulation of initiation factor activities (4Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar) that usually affect global translation, whereas the second type involves specific protein repressors that bind to one or a small set of mRNAs (5Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 335-363Google Scholar), leading to specific control. The third type of mechanism may involve proteins associated with many or even all mRNA species, such as proteins present in messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) 1The abbreviations used are: mRNPs, messenger ribonucleoprotein particles; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FRG Y2, frog Y-box transcription factor 2.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 319-334Google Scholar). These proteins also may contribute to global control of protein synthesis. mRNPs isolated from the cytoplasm of different cells and tissues contain two major proteins with molecular masses of 70 and 50 kDa (8Jain S.K. Pluskal M.G. Sarkar S. FEBS Lett. 1979; 97: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The 50-kDa protein (p50) is the most abundant and the most strongly bound protein within free nontranslatable mRNPs (9Minich W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and therefore can be regarded as the core mRNP protein of these particles in mammalian somatic cells. It is also present in mRNPs derived from polysomes, but in lower amounts (9Minich W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Minich W.B. Maidebura I.P. Ovchinnikov L.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Regardless of the fact that p50 displayed little or no specificity for RNA in in vitro binding experiments (10Minich W.B. Maidebura I.P. Ovchinnikov L.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Evdokimova V.M. Wei C.-L. Sitikov A.S. Simonenko P.N. Lazarev O.A. Vasilenko K.S. Ustinov V.A. Hershey J.W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3186-3192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), in cell extracts, p50 was found only in association with mRNA (12Davydova E.K. Evdokimova V.M. Ovchinnikov L.P. Hershey J.W.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2911-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This protein is located mostly in the cytoplasm, and its amount is ∼0.1% of the total protein, which corresponds to ∼5–10 molecules of p50/molecule of mRNA (12Davydova E.K. Evdokimova V.M. Ovchinnikov L.P. Hershey J.W.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2911-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Among all mRNP proteins, p50 is the most basic, with a pI of ∼9.5 (10Minich W.B. Maidebura I.P. Ovchinnikov L.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the absence of RNA, p50 forms large multimeric complexes with a molecular mass of ∼800 kDa (11Evdokimova V.M. Wei C.-L. Sitikov A.S. Simonenko P.N. Lazarev O.A. Vasilenko K.S. Ustinov V.A. Hershey J.W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3186-3192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). When binding to mRNA, p50 melts up to 60% of the RNA secondary structure (11Evdokimova V.M. Wei C.-L. Sitikov A.S. Simonenko P.N. Lazarev O.A. Vasilenko K.S. Ustinov V.A. Hershey J.W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3186-3192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We have shown earlier that p50 is responsible for the repressed nonactive state of globin mRNA within free mRNPs (13Minich W.B. Korneyeva N.L. Ovchinnikov L.P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and that it strongly inhibits translation of exogenous mRNA in cell-free translation systems (9Minich W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,14Minich W.B. Volyanik E.V. Korneyeva N.L. Berezin Y.V. Ovchinnikov L.P. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1990; 14: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) as well as in vivo translation of mRNA expressed from a reporter gene (12Davydova E.K. Evdokimova V.M. Ovchinnikov L.P. Hershey J.W.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2911-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). According to its amino acid sequence and its affinity for DNA, p50 was identified as a member of the most evolutionarily conserved family of Y-box-binding proteins from bacteria to man (11Evdokimova V.M. Wei C.-L. Sitikov A.S. Simonenko P.N. Lazarev O.A. Vasilenko K.S. Ustinov V.A. Hershey J.W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3186-3192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Some proteins of this family are known as transcription factors affecting transcription of genes containing Y-box sequence elements in their promoters (15Wolffe A.P. Tafuri S.R. Ranjan M. Famolari M. New Biol. 1992; 4: 290-298PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wolffe A.P. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 17Ladomery M. Sommerville J. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The prokaryotic Y-box-binding protein is also known as a major cold shock protein stimulating gene expression under cold shock conditions (18Goldstein J. Pollitt N.S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Two homologous core mRNP proteins (p54/p56) fromXenopus oocytes have also identified as members of the Y-box-binding protein family and are closely related, if not identical, to FRG Y2, the germ cell-specific form of the transcription factor (19Murray M.T. Schiller D.L. Franke W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). They were reported to be responsible for the masked state of mRNAs in Xenopus oocytes (20Richter J.D. Smith L.D. Nature. 1984; 309: 378-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 21Marello K. LaRovere J. Sommerville J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5593-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Ranjan M. Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P.

One can therefore conclude that the somatic mRNP protein p50 and the germ cell mRNP proteins p54/p56 have a similar function in the cytoplasm, namely that of preventing mRNA translation. Thus, the Y-box-binding proteins can influence protein synthesis both by affecting transcription of Y-box-containing genes and by inhibiting translation of a wide variety of mRNAs. By interacting with DNA in the nucleus and with mRNA in the cytoplasm, these proteins may establish a balance between gene activity and mRNA content in cells. In a detailed study of the effect of p50 on exogenous mRNA translation in reticulocyte lysates, we showed that p50 inhibits mRNA translation when added at a high p50/mRNA ratio. However, with high inhibitory amounts of purified mRNA, addition of low amounts of p50 increases the efficiency of mRNA translation (9Minich W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This intriguing result suggests that p50 may also play a positive role in translation. Here we ask if depletion of p50 affects the rate of protein synthesis in reticulocyte lysates. Reduced p50 activity was accomplished by adding p50-specific antibodies. In this instance, translation is inhibited at the level of initiation, thereby providing evidence for a positive role of p50 in promoting protein synthesis. p50 from free mRNPs of rabbit reticulocytes was obtained as described earlier (11Evdokimova V.M. Wei C.-L. Sitikov A.S. Simonenko P.N. Lazarev O.A. Vasilenko K.S. Ustinov V.A. Hershey J.W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3186-3192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), except that the step of protein precipitation with (NH4)2SO4 was omitted. Recombinant p50 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells, and the protein was purified by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose 4B and Superose 12 HR 10/30 columns (Pharmacia Biotechnology, Inc.) as described (25Ustinov V.A. Skabkin M.A. Nashchekin D.V. Evdokimova V.M. Ovchinnikov L.P. Biochemistry (Moscow). 1996; 61: 414-419Google Scholar). The p50 preparations were dialyzed against buffer containing 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, and 250 mmKCl and stored at −70 °C in aliquots. Protein concentration was determined by staining with a Micro-BCA kit (Pierce). Polyclonal antibodies were produced either in mice against p50 from rabbit reticulocytes (11Evdokimova V.M. Wei C.-L. Sitikov A.S. Simonenko P.N. Lazarev O.A. Vasilenko K.S. Ustinov V.A. Hershey J.W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3186-3192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) or in rabbits against recombinant p50 synthesized in E. coli (12Davydova E.K. Evdokimova V.M. Ovchinnikov L.P. Hershey J.W.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2911-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Anti-p50 IgG and preimmune IgG were purified on a protein A-Sepharose column (Sigma) (26Ey P.L. Prowse S.J. Jenkin C.R. Biochemistry. 1978; 15: 429-436Google Scholar), dialyzed, and stored in buffer containing 10 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.6, and 100 mm KOAc; therefore, the same buffer was added to parallel control incubations throughout the experiments described. For Western blot analysis, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked overnight at 20 °C with 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 0.05% Tween 20 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 150 mm NaCl and probed with anti-p50 antibodies at 1:500 dilution. Immunocomplexes were detected with alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibodies (Cappel) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Globin mRNA was obtained from polysomes of rabbit reticulocytes by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography as described (27Aviv H. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5183) Google Scholar). E. coli β-galactosidase mRNA was obtained by in vitro transcription with SP6 polymerase from pJCS-β-galactosidase linearized with HindIII according to standard procedures (28Melton D.A. Kreig P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4057) Google Scholar). Translation reactions were performed in rabbit reticulocyte lysates prepared as described (29Pelham H.R.B. Jackson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (2434) Google Scholar). Mixtures (30 μl) contained 15 μl of reticulocyte lysate, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KOAc, 1 mm Mg(OAc)2, 8 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.2 mm GTP, 0.8 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μm each amino acid except for the labeled ones, and 6 μCi of [14C]Leu (>300 mCi/mmol; Radioisotop, Obninsk, Russian Federation) or 1 μCi of [35S]Met (>700 Ci/mmol; Radioisotop). When micrococcal nuclease-treated lysates were used, the mixture was supplemented with mRNA as indicated in the figure legends. Translations were carried out at 30 °C for 60 min unless stated otherwise; 5-μl aliquots were treated with deacylation solution (0.3 m NaOH and 150 mmH2O2) and measured for trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity. When [35S]Met was used, the samples were also subjected to 10–22% SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. For ribosome transit time measurements, the volume of the translation mixtures was increased to 150 μl, and translations were carried out as described above. At the indicated intervals, 25-μl aliquots were diluted with 125 μl of ice-cold stop buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm cycloheximide (Sigma) and placed immediately on ice. The mixtures were layered onto a 30% glycerol cushion prepared with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged at 100,000 rpm in a TLA-100.3 rotor (Beckman Instruments) for 40 min. This procedure deposits polyribosomes and monomeric ribosomes in the pellet. The ribosomal pellet was dissolved in 1% SDS, and this fraction and the supernatant were assayed for radioactivity as described above. For neutralization of p50 activity, reticulocyte lysates (15 μl) were preincubated with the indicated amounts of antibodies for 10 min at 0 °C. For immunodepletion experiments, nuclease-treated reticulocyte lysates (200 μl) were preincubated with various amounts of antibodies for 10 min at 0 °C with gentle agitation and passed through a 200-μl column of protein A-Sepharose equilibrated with 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KOAc, and 1 mm MgCl2. The first 250 μl of flow-through material from the column was collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen in 15-μl aliquots. Neutralized or immunodepleted reticulocyte lysates were reconstituted by adding the indicated amounts of p50 directly to the lysate and incubating for 3 min at 0 °C. The neutralized, depleted, and reconstituted lysates were then assayed for protein synthesis activity as described above. Cell-free translation mixtures (30 μl) were cooled and immediately layered onto 15–30% (w/v) linear sucrose gradients in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2. Centrifugation was carried out at 45,000 rpm in an SW 60 rotor (Beckman Instruments) for the times indicated in the figure legends. All gradients were monitored for absorbance at 254 nm during their collection from the bottom. Fractions of 300 μl were diluted with 700 μl of ice-cold water and treated with deacylation solution, and [14C]Leu incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was measured as described above. For dot hybridization analysis of globin mRNA, total RNA was extracted from the fractions by an equal volume of phenol/chloroform, filtered onto a nitrocellulose Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Corp.), and probed with a full-length α-globin cDNA32P-labeled by the multiprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Corp.). For quantitation of hybridized RNA, each dot was excised, and radioactivity was measured by Cherenkov counting in a Beckman LS-100C scintillation counter. To verify the suggestion that p50 may play a positive role in protein biosynthesis, we sought to deplete p50 activity in reticulocyte lysates. For selective reduction of p50 activity in the rabbit reticulocyte cell-free translation system, two different polyclonal anti-p50 antibody preparations were used. The antibodies were raised either in mouse against p50 from free rabbit reticulocyte mRNPs or in rabbit against recombinant p50 expressed inE. coli. Both p50 preparations were purified to homogeneity; no other peptide bands were detected by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining of these proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A). The two anti-p50 antibodies were purified on protein A-Sepharose, and their specificities were tested by immunoblotting. The antibodies reacted strongly with purified p50 and recognized only a single antigen in reticulocyte lysates corresponding in electrophoretic mobility to p50 (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, the antibodies are monospecific and may be suitable for neutralization of p50 activity due to their specific binding to p50 in the rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system and for p50 immunodepletion by affinity adsorption from the lysate. Both antibody preparations gave identical results, so further reported experimental data are on antibodies against rabbit reticulocyte p50, unless indicated otherwise. The effect of anti-p50 IgG addition on translation of endogenous and exogenous globin mRNAs in the rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system is shown in Fig. 1 (C and D, respectively). In both systems, the antibodies caused a dramatic inhibition of globin synthesis, whereas the control immunoglobulins from a nonimmunized animal (preimmune IgG) affected the activity of the system only slightly. A straightforward interpretation of these results is that anti-p50 IgG binds to p50 and inhibits its putative function in promoting mRNA translation. To deplete p50 from the cell-free translation system, a micrococcal nuclease-treated lysate was mixed with various amounts of anti-p50 IgG and then passed through a protein A-Sepharose column. Increasing amounts of added antibodies against either rabbit or recombinant p50 caused an increasing loss of lysate protein-synthesizing activity in exogenous mRNA (Fig. 2), with the highest amount resulting in ∼90% inhibition. Since antibodies against recombinant p50 cannot be contaminated with even trace amounts of antibodies against other eukaryotic proteins, we conclude that anti-p50 antibodies inhibit protein synthesis. Furthermore, the p50 content in the depleted lysates was measured by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2, inset). The results show a progressive loss of p50, with barely detectable p50 at the highest antibody concentration. There is a rough linear correlation between the p50 content and translational activity, suggestive of p50 being limiting for protein synthesis in these lysates. To obtain stronger evidence that the translation inhibition caused by adding specific anti-p50 antibodies results from p50 inactivation, p50 was added back to the cell-free systems that had been neutralized or depleted (Fig. 3). In these experiments, we used p50 isolated from free rabbit reticulocyte mRNPs as well as recombinant p50 synthesized in E. coli and therefore absolutely free of even trace amounts of other eukaryotic proteins that can affect translation. The results of experiments with both preparations proved to be nearly the same. p50 completely restored protein synthesis in the inhibited systems reduced to 40% of their activity (Fig. 3 B). With more profound inhibition (reduced to 10–20% activity), p50 stimulated translation 3–4-fold; the system's activity increased linearly with increasing amounts of p50 and finally reached 45–65% of the initial lysate activity (Fig. 3 A). A further increase of the p50 amount caused inhibition of translation (data not shown), which is in good agreement with our earlier observation that p50 acts as a translational repressor at a high p50/mRNA ratio (9Minich W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In reticulocyte lysate, after immunodepletion, biosynthesis was restored after addition of 2–3 μg of p50/1 μg of exogenous globin mRNA (10–15 pmol of p50/pmol of globin mRNA), which is near the p50/mRNA ratio in COS cells, i.e. 5–10 molecules of p50/molecule of mRNA (12Davydova E.K. Evdokimova V.M. Ovchinnikov L.P. Hershey J.W.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2911-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). After profound inhibition of protein biosynthesis by antibodies, incomplete restoration by p50 can probably be explained by improper modification of p50 from nontranslatable free mRNPs or recombinant p50 used for the activity restoration. Another explanation is that other auxiliary factors important for p50 activity were removed from the system by antibodies due to their association with p50. These proteins are the subject of our study at the moment. Nevertheless, the fact that highly purified or recombinant p50 by itself is capable of restoring or stimulating protein-synthesizing activity strongly indicates that the inhibition by antibodies is mostly due to specific recognition and inactivation of p50 rather than some other proteins. These results suggest that p50 is required for efficient protein synthesis. Antibody binding to p50 may stimulate mRNA decay in the cell-free translation system, thereby causing translation inhibition. To verify this idea, RNAs were isolated from lysates incubated under cell-free translation conditions with and without anti-p50 IgG and tested for messenger activity. Both mRNA preparations possessed equal messenger activity in the cell-free translation system and produced full-length globin chains as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). The messenger activity of these RNAs was the same as that of RNA from a nonincubated lysate (data not shown). Thus, anti-p50 IgG-induced protein synthesis inhibition is not caused by mRNA degradation. Fig. 5 shows the effect of anti-p50 IgG on the kinetics of protein synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysates with endogenous (panel A) and exogenous (panel B) globin mRNAs. With either type of mRNA, anti-p50 IgG inhibited strongly at high concentrations, whereas preimmune IgG had little or no effect. The inhibition of endogenous mRNA translation with a high anti-p50 IgG concentration resembled the inhibition caused by edeine, a specific inhibitor of the initiation phase of protein synthesis (30Kozak M. Cell. 1980; 22: 459-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 31Anthony D.D. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1554-1562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the shape of the curves suggests that the antibodies inhibit mainly translation initiation. The phase of translation affected by an inhibitor can be determined more precisely by polysome profile analysis and measurement of the elongation rate. The run-off of ribosomes from polysomes usually indicates inhibition of initiation, whereas maintenance of or an increase in polysome size suggests inhibition of elongation/termination. We have compared the polysome profiles of reticulocyte lysates incubated in the absence and presence of either anti-p50 IgG or preimmune IgG (Fig. 6). A short incubation (2 min) of the cell-free system without antibodies or with preimmune IgG did not produce any remarkable change in the polysome profiles (Fig. 6, compare A with B and C). However, incubation with anti-p50 IgG resulted in a complete polysomal decay (Fig. 6 D). The process was accompanied by dissociation of the radiolabeled polypeptide chain from the ribosomes. This indicates that polysomal decay is not due to mRNA fragmentation by ribonucleases as such cleavage of polysomes produces ribosomes associated with the growing polypeptide. Rather, the run-off of ribosomes from polysomes implies that anti-p50 IgG inhibits mainly initiation and not elongation or termination. The average time of elongation + termination of polypeptide chains (transit time) can be quantitatively determined by measuring the kinetics of radioactive amino acid incorporation into total protein and into completed polypeptides released from the ribosome (32Fan H. Pennman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 50: 655-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). We used this technique to determine the effect of anti-p50 IgG on the elongation + termination rate. From the results shown in Fig. 7, the transit time for globin synthesis in the control uninhibited lysate was 1.4 min. In the experimental system with anti-p50 IgG, the same transit time was obtained, although in this case, protein synthesis was suppressed 2-fold over the studied time range (6 min). Thus, anti-p50 antibodies do not affect the polypeptide elongation + termination rate and inhibit only initiation. p50 is a universal mRNP protein associated with all or almost all mRNAs of mammalian somatic cells (11Evdokimova V.M. Wei C.-L. Sitikov A.S. Simonenko P.N. Lazarev O.A. Vasilenko K.S. Ustinov V.A. Hershey J.W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3186-3192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The question arises as to whether p50 promotes only initiation of eukaryotic mRNAs having an m7G cap, a characteristic consensus sequence around the initiator AUG codon and 3′-poly(A) tail, or whether it would exert the same positive effect on translation of a bacterial mRNA lacking these features. To answer this question, an uncapped mRNA transcript encoding E. coli β-galactosidase was translated in the reticulocyte cell-free system without antibodies or with anti-p50 IgG added either at zero time or after 10 min of incubation (when only elongation occurs). The kinetics of β-galactosidase synthesis was studied by SDS-PAGE analysis of the product obtained after different incubation times. Synthesis of full-length β-galactosidase was completed in 20–40 min in the system without antibodies (Fig. 8 A) (33Smailov S.K. Mukhamedzhanov B.G. Lee A.V. Iskakov B.K. Denisenko O.N. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). When anti-p50 IgG was added before incubation, no synthesis of full-length or even partial-length protein was observed (Fig. 8 B), consistent with inhibition at initiation. With anti-p50 IgG added after 10 min of incubation, β-galactosidase synthesis occurred and yielded full-length product after 40 min of incubation (Fig. 8 C). The pattern of partial proteins seen does not differ detectably from that obtained with the control lysate (Fig. 8 A). These results show that p50 is strongly required for initiation of bacterial mRNA translation, and it does not affect elongation even at antibody concentrations providing the complete inhibition of initiation. This is in good agreement with our previous findings on eukaryotic globin mRNA (Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). To identify the step in the initiation pathway that is inhibited by anti-p50 IgG, the cell-free translation systems were incubated without antibodies, with anti-p50 IgG, or with edeine and then fractionated by centrifugation in sucrose gradients. The distribution of α-globin mRNA in the gradient was determined by dot hybridization with 32P-labeled α-globin cDNA. In the control cell-free translation system, mRNA was found mainly on 80 S ribosomes and to a lower extent in the region of free globin mRNPs (∼20 S) (Fig. 9 A). After incubation in the presence of edeine blocking the joining of the 60 S subunit (30Kozak M. Cell. 1980; 22: 459-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 31Anthony D.D. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1554-1562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), most of the α-globin mRNA was found in the region where the small 40 S ribosomal subunit sediments and can be regarded as the 48 S preinitiation complexes (40 S·Met-tRNAi·eukaryotic initiation factor-2·GTP· mRNA) (Fig. 9 C). In the system incubated in the presence of anti-p50 IgG, the bulk of α-globin mRNA was also found in 48 S preinitiation complexes (Fig. 9 B). Thus, anti-p50 IgG does not inhibit binding of 40 S ribosomes to mRNA, but rather inhibits a subsequent step in the initiation pathway. The results reported here indicate that p50, the major protein of cytoplasmic mRNPs, not only functions as a repressor of mRNA translation, but also is required for protein biosynthesis. Two independent preparations of monospecific anti-p50 antibodies raised against either rabbit or recombinant p50 were used to reduce the activity of endogenous p50 in rabbit reticulocyte lysates or to prepare depleted lysates. Immunoneutralization or immunodepletion of p50 by both antibody preparations caused inhibition of protein synthesis. Addition of highly purified rabbit or recombinant p50 proteins to such systems restored the translational activity completely or nearly completely, which confirms the positive role of p50 in mRNA translation. How can p50 function both to promote and to repress translation? Thein vitro assays for p50 activity suggest that the level of p50 determines whether it stimulates or inhibits translation. With the p50/mRNA weight ratio increasing up to 2 (which is characteristic of polysomal mRNPs), p50 stimulates protein biosynthesis, whereas a further increase of the ratio up to 5–6 (close to the ratios characteristic of free mRNPs) causes a gradual inhibition of translation until it ceases completely (9Minich W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, the inactive-to-active transition of mRNA may be connected with a decrease in the amount of p50 attached to an mRNA molecule. The amount of p50 on mRNA can possibly be regulated by phosphorylation. It is known that p50 is a phosphoprotein (10Minich W.B. Maidebura I.P. Ovchinnikov L.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 34Auerbach S. Pederson T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 63: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and may be phosphorylated by a protein kinase present in mRNPs that resembles casein kinase II. 2V. A. Ustinov, M. A. Skabkin, V. M. Evdokimova, J. W. B. Hershey, and L. P. Ovchinnikov, manuscript in preparation. Furthermore, the Xenopus proteins p54/p56 are phosphoproteins, and their binding to RNA is enhanced upon phosphorylation by casein kinase II (35Kick D. Barret P. Cummings A. Sommerville J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4099-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p54/p56 results in inhibition of protein synthesis, whereas inhibitors of casein kinase II activate translation (24Braddock M. Muckenthaler M. White M.R.H. Thorburn A.M. Sommerville J. Kingsman A.J. Kingsman S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 35Kick D. Barret P. Cummings A. Sommerville J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4099-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Work is in progress to elucidate how phosphorylation of p50 may affect its binding to RNA and its activity in stimulating and inhibiting translation in vitro. Immunoneutralization of p50 does not change the ribosome transit time for globin synthesis and does not affect elongation of prokaryotic β-galactosidase. This means that p50 is not required for elongation and termination, and consequently, it is required only for initiation. The effect of anti-p50 IgG on the kinetics of protein synthesis in the cell-free translation system and on the decay of polysomes also points to inhibition of translation initiation. Analysis of the distribution of globin mRNA in reticulocyte lysates inhibited by anti-p50 IgG shows that mRNA accumulates in 48 S preinitiation complexes. This means that p50 is not required for attachment of the small subunit of the ribosome to mRNA, although it is necessary for subsequent binding of the 60 S ribosomal subunit to the complex. We suggest that either p50 directly participates in attachment of the 60 S ribosomal subunit to the 48 S preinitiation complex or that it is involved in the previous step of 5′-untranslated region mRNA scanning by the 43 S preinitiation complex. Several mechanisms of p50 participation in translation initiation can be proposed. (i) Nonspecific affinity of p50 for RNA and the presence of many copies of p50 on mRNA can protect mRNA against nonspecific binding of initiation factors along its entire length, thus contributing to their specific binding to the 5′-untranslated region (9Minich W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 36Svitkin Y.V. Ovchinnikov L.P. Dreyfuss G. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7147-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). (ii) Since p50 possesses RNA-unwinding activity (11Evdokimova V.M. Wei C.-L. Sitikov A.S. Simonenko P.N. Lazarev O.A. Vasilenko K.S. Ustinov V.A. Hershey J.W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3186-3192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), its direct participation in 5′-untranslated region scanning is quite possible. (iii) p50 provides the general mRNA structure favorable for translation initiation. (iv) Finally, we cannot rule out that p50 affects translation initiation by its direct interaction with translation initiation factors. These suggestions are being verified currently. p50 is not the only mRNP protein implicated in the initiation phase of protein synthesis. Another major mRNP protein, p70 (or poly(A)-binding protein), appears to be involved in protein synthesis initiation, too (37Grossi de Sa M.F. Standart N. Martins de Sa C. Akbayat O. Muesca M.

Whether poly(A)-binding protein and p50 interact directly on mRNAs has not yet been determined.

In this study, we observed that expression of the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase γ (POLγCAT) mRNA varies little among different tissues and is not increased by continuous neural activation of skeletal muscle, a potent stimulus to mitochondrial biogenesis. Increased copy number for the POLγ locus in a human cell line bearing a partial duplication of chromosome 15 increased the abundance of POLγCAT mRNA without up-regulation of mtDNA. In contrast, expression of mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding (mtSSB) mRNA is regulated coordinately with variations in the abundance of mtDNA among tissues of mammalian organisms and is up-regulated in association with the enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis that characterizes early postnatal development of the heart and the adaptive response of skeletal myofibers to motor nerve stimulation. In addition, we noted that expression of mtSSB is concentrated within perinuclear mitochondria that constitute active sites of mtDNA replication. We conclude that constitutive expression of the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase is sufficient to support physiological variations in mtDNA replication among specialized cell types, whereas expression of the mtSSB gene is controlled by molecular mechanisms acting to regulate mtDNA replication or stability in mammalian cells.

Cells of vertebrate organisms differ markedly in their ability to utilize oxidative phosphorylation to meet cellular energy requirements, reflecting major variations in the cellular content of mitochondria and of respiratory proteins. This variation is most striking among specialized subtypes of striated myocytes (1Saltin B. Gollnick P.D. Peachey L.D.D. Handbook of Physiology: Skeletal Muscle. American Physiological Society, Bethesda1983: 555-632Google Scholar). Mitochondria may occupy 50% or more of cell volume in cardiac myocytes of some species while type IIb skeletal myofibers have sparse mitochondria (approximately 1% of cell volume). Other subtypes of skeletal myofibers (type I or IIa) occupy intermediate positions on this spectrum. Mitochondria-rich muscle subtypes are resistant to fatigue, whereas glycolytic myofibers with few mitochondria are adapted for short bursts of high power output and fatigue rapidly with sustained activity. Cells adapted for high rates of respiration exhibit increased expression of both nuclear and mitochondrial genes encoding enzymes of oxidative phosphorylation, and enhanced mitochondrial gene expression is accompanied by amplification of the mitochondrial genome relative to nuclear DNA in mitochondria-rich muscle subtypes (2Williams R.S.

Chem. 1986; 261: 376-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These specialized characteristics of myocytes with respect to respiratory capacity and mtDNA are established by developmental cues but can be modified in adults by changing physiological demands or disease processes (2Williams R.S.

DNA polymerase γ (POLγ) catalyzes replication of mtDNA, and conserved genes encoding the catalytic subunit of POLγ have recently been cloned from several eukaryotic species, including humans (5Ropp P.A. Copeland W.C. Genomics. 1996; 36: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 6Ye F. Carrodeguas J.A. Bogenhagen D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Disruption of the POLγ gene in yeast (7Foury F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20552-20560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrates that the enzyme has no essential functions outside of mitochondria but is absolutely required for mtDNA replication. A mitochondrial single-stranded DNA binding protein (mtSSB) also is necessary for mtDNA replication in yeast (8Van Dyck E. Foury F. Stillman B. Brill S.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3421-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and mtSSBs have been identified in several vertebrate species (9Tiranti V. Rocchi M. DiDonato S. Zeviani M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 126: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As assessed in cell-free reactions, mtSSB augments both fidelity and processivity of POLγ (10Williams A.J. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 860-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 11Hoke G.D. Pavco P.A. Ledwith B.J. Van Tuyle G.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined expression of the POLγCAT and mtSSB genes in different tissues or specialized subtypes of striated myocytes with markedly different contents of mtDNA. In addition, we characterized changes in expression of these genes in striated muscles responding to continuous motor nerve stimulation, a potent stimulus to replication of mtDNA. The results show that expression of POLγCAT mRNA is constitutive while expression of mtSSB is strictly regulated and correlates directly with mtDNA content. Regulated expression of mtSSB also was observed in conjunction with the up-regulation of mtDNA that occurs within the myocardium during the first few weeks of post-natal life. Overexpression of POLγCAT evoked by an increase in gene dosage failed to affect the content of mtDNA. In addition, we noted that the mtSSB protein is distributed nonuniformly within murine myogenic cells in culture and is preferentially localized to perinuclear mitochondria that constitute active sites of mtDNA replication (12Davis A.F. Clayton D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These data indicate that expression of nuclear genes encoding proteins essential for mtDNA replication is differentially, rather than coordinately, regulated in response to signaling pathways that control mitochondrial biogenesis in mammalian cells. Using primers based on the published sequences of the rat and human mtSSB cDNAs, partial cDNAs encoding rabbit and mouse mtSSB proteins were cloned using reverse transcriptase-PCR. 20 μg of total heart RNA were reversed transcribed using Superscript II (Boehringer Mannheim) by the manufacturer recommendations. The PCR primers for cloning rabbit mtSSB cDNA were: 1) 5′-CTNGCNACNAAYGARATGTGG-3′, and 2) 5′-ACRTTRTTYTTRTCCATRTAYTC-3′. The PCR primers for cloning mouse mtSSB cDNA were: 1) 5′-AGGCTTGCGCGTCAGGAA-3′, and 2) 5′-TAGACTGTACATGATTTGCAAAGG-3′. Amplification products were cloned and sequenced. The mouse and rabbit partial cDNAs (∼200 nucleotides) exhibited 94 and 85% nucleotide sequence identity, respectively, with the published rat mtSSB sequence (9Tiranti V. Rocchi M. DiDonato S. Zeviani M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 126: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Experiments designed to establish a detailed physical map of chromosome 15q26.1, including direct selection of partial cDNA clones encoded by this region, yielded three expressed sequence-tagged clones with near perfect homology to the Saccharomyces cerevisiaePolγCAT gene (7Foury F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20552-20560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent screening of HeLa and human brain cDNA libraries yielded numerous clones with homology to yeast Polγ, the largest being 2.8 kb. Repeated rounds of 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends were used to complete cloning of the PolγCAT cDNA. The composite sequence proved identical to that of the human PolγCAT cDNA which was independently isolated and reported by Ropp and Copeland (5Ropp P.A. Copeland W.C. Genomics. 1996; 36: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). A partial rabbit PolγCAT cDNA was cloned to provide a species-specific probe for analysis of PolγCAT mRNA in rabbit tissues. Comparison of mouse and human PolγCATcDNA sequences revealed a region of high conservation at the nucleotide level from position 3257 to 3733 within the human cDNA sequence. Primers matching the mouse sequence were used to amplify a 476-base pair product from rabbit mRNA which was cloned and sequenced. This region bears 92% identity to the human nucleotide sequence. Eighteen New Zealand White rabbits were purchased from Myrtle's Rabbitry (Thompson Station, TN). The common peroneal nerve was stimulated continuously at 6–10 Hz as described previously (13Ordway G.A. Li K. Hand G.A. Williams R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1511-C1516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Animals were sacrificed after 1, 3, 7, 14, or 21 days of stimulation (n = 3 at each time point), and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles from stimulated and unstimulated hindlimbs were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. From control animals, the TA, soleus, gastrocnemius, plantaris, and extensor digitorum longus were removed and stored in a similar manner. Pregnant mice (strain ICR) were purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc. Litter sizes ranged from 8–12 pups. Littermates were sacrificed on day 1, day 5, day 10, day 15, and day 20 post-partum, and as adults (n = 4–6 at each time point). At sacrifice, the hearts were removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. All animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee and were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. RNA and DNA were isolated from muscle homogenates or cultured cells, and Northern and Southern blots were prepared and probed by standard procedures. DNA samples were restricted with HindIII (rabbit DNA) or EcoRI (mouse DNA) to permit unambiguous identification of mtDNA. mRNA samples prepared from specific human tissues were obtained from a commercial source (CLONTECH). Species-specific radiolabeled probes were prepared by PCR or by extension of random hexamer oligonucleotides using mtSSB cDNA, PolγCATcDNA, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 28 S ribosomal RNA, mtDNA, or a chromosome 15 marker, D15S10, as the template. A 409-base pair fragment of the rat mtSSB cDNA, corresponding to the full-length mature protein, was obtained through PCR using a rat mtSSB full-length cDNA as the template. NcoI and EcoRI restriction sites were engineered into the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cDNA, respectively, and the fragment was subcloned into the expression vector, pGEX-CS (14Parks T.D. Leuther K.K. Howard E.D. Johnston S.A. Dougherty W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Induction of transformants with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-generated recombinant rat mtSSB fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST). The purification procedure included affinity chromotography using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), followed by incubation with tobacco etch virus protease (Life Technologies, Inc.) to release mtSSB from the resin-bound GST moiety. The supernatant was concentrated with a Centriprep unit (Amicon), and mtSSB was purified to apparent homogeneity by preparative electrophoresis on a 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel using the Prep-Cell (Bio-Rad). Purified antigen (100 μg) was mixed with an equal volume of Titer-Max adjuvant (CytRx Corp.) and injected both intramuscularly and subcutaneously into a New Zealand White rabbit. Blood and serum samples were acquired by standard methods. The antiserum was purified further by precipitation in 33% ammonium sulfate. Murine C2C12 myogenic cells were propogated as described previously (15Bassel-Duby R. Hernandez M.D. Yang Q. Rochelle J.M. Seldin M.F. Williams R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4596-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and plated onto gelatin-coated coverslips and further cultured for 24 h. Cells attached to coverslips were rinsed in cold PBS fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4 °C, rinsed, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated in block solution (1.0% bovine serum albumin) for 10 min. Cells were hydrated in PBS, incubated with 10% normal goat serum to reduce background staining for 30 min at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody (anti-mtSSB). On the following day, the cells were washed, incubated with the secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch)) and Mitotracker dye (Molecular Probes), washed further, and mounted on glass slides with Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories). Substitution controls with either normal rabbit serum or PBS were performed, and in all instances the controls were negative. Human lymphoblastoid cell lines were grown in RPMI medium and fibroblasts in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, each supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and 4 mml-glutamine. Cell lines included cytogenetically normal lymphoblastoid (SC-1) and fibroblast (SMITO-1 and GM01604) controls, as well as a line designated SA15q-3 derived from a patient diagnosed with a direct duplication of the distal portion of chromosome 15 (dir dup(15)(pter-q24.1::q15-q26.2::q25.2-qter)). This structural rearrangement was expected to result in triploidy for the PolγCAT locus, given that this gene had previously been mapped to 15q25 (16Walker R.L. Anziano P. Meltzer P.S. Genomics. 1997; 40: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and was identified for the present studies based on its localization within the physical map of 15q25-q26.1. 2L. D. McDaniel and R. A. Schultz, unpublished observation. Autoradiographs of Northern blots were optically scanned to generate a quantitative estimation of mRNA abundance relative to 28 S rRNA or to GAPDH within each RNA extract. Data from Southern blots were quantified in a similar manner. In the experiments involving motor nerve stimulation of rabbit skeletal muscles or post-natal development of the mouse heart, three-six animals were examined at each time point. Differences between group means were assessed using Dunnet's post-hoc test with significance defined as p < 0.05. Mammalian tissues differ markedly with respect to the abundance of mtDNA (2Williams R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12390-12394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to expression of certain nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins (4Williams R.S. Garcia-Moll M. Mellor J. Salmons S. Harlan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2764-2767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Annex B.H. Kraus W.E. Dohm G.L. Williams R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C266-C270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Northern analysis indicated that expression of PolγCAT mRNA in a variety of human tissues bears no apparent relationship to mitochondrial mass or mtDNA content. After normalization to an internal standard (GAPDH mRNA), expression of PolγCAT mRNA in heart differed by no more than 2-fold from levels observed in any other human tissue (pancreas, kidney, liver, lung, brain, colon, prostate, thymus, and spleen; data not shown). The expression of PolγCATmRNA in mitochondria-rich cardiac tissue by comparison to lung is illustrated in Fig. 1 A where the quantitative analysis revealed expression in the lung to be approximately 2-fold greater than that found in the heart. In rabbit TA muscles subjected to chronic stimulation via the motor nerve, a potent stimulus to mitochodrial biogenesis and mtDNA replication (3Williams R.S. Salmons S. Newsholme E.A. Kaufman R.E. Mellor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 376-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there was no detectable induction of expression of POLγ mRNA (Fig. 1 B). The magnitude of the increase in mtDNA in this set of animals (3.5-fold at 10–21 days) was comparable with that observed previously in our laboratory (3Williams R.S. Salmons S. Newsholme E.A. Kaufman R.E. Mellor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 376-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ordway G.A. Li K. Hand G.A. Williams R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1511-C1516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A Northern blot was performed with mRNA from normal control cell lines (SC-1, SMITO-1, and GM01604) and a line established from a patient expected to be triploid for the PolγCAT locus (SA15q-3). Expression of POLγ mRNA was elevated approximately 3-fold over that seen in the diploid control cell lines (Fig. 2 A). Southern blots of DNA derived from control and SA15q-3 cell lines were probed with a fragment of the PolγCAT gene or with a sequence (D15S10) mapping to the proximal non-duplicated region of the chromosome. The results demonstrated a 9-kb HindIII PolγCAT band consistent with a 9,081-base pair size predicted from genomic sequencing of this region.2 Moreover, the results confirm that the PolγCAT locus is triploid in this cell line (Fig. 2 B). Quantitation of the relative band intensities revealed an SA15q-3:control ratio for PolγCAT of 1.52 when normalized for the diploid marker D15S10. Southern blots probed with a fragment of human mtDNA encoding the cytochrome bgene demonstrated a 10-kb band, consistent with a size of 10,202 base pairs predicted from the human mtDNA sequence (18Anderson S. Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G. deBruijn M.H. Coulson A.R. Drouin J. Eperon I.C. Nierlich D.P. Roe B.A. Sanger F. Schreier P.H. Smith A.J. Staden R. Young I.G. Nature. 1981; 290: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (7644) Google Scholar). A quantitative comparison of the relative intensities of the mtDNA hybridization signals from SA15q-3 and control cells (Fig. 2 B) was calculated at a ratio of 1.06, demonstrating that the increased expression of PolγCAT mRNA is not associated with a greater abundance of mtDNA in this cell line in which the PolγCAT locus is amplified. Using rabbit mtSSB cDNA as the probe under conditions of high stringency, two transcripts with molecular weights of approximately 940 and 650 bases were detected in RNA extracted from rabbit muscles (Fig. 3, A and B). The smaller of the two transcripts corresponds to the size of mtSSB mRNA described previously in rat and human cells (9Tiranti V. Rocchi M. DiDonato S. Zeviani M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 126: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and to the single transcript observed in murine cells (Fig. 3 C). Drosophila express two transcripts of 0.6 and 1.5 kb that hybridize to a mtSSB cDNA probe (19Stroumbakis N.D. Li Z. Tolias P.P. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 143: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and two isoforms of mtSSB have been described in Xenopus laevis(20Ghrir R. Lecaer J.P. Dufresne C. Gueride M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 291: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but this is the first demonstration of multiple mtSSB transcipts in a mammalian species. The relative abundance of the 650 base transcript correlated directly with the oxidative capacity, fractional volume of mitochondria, and mtDNA content (2Williams R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12390-12394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of individual striated muscles of this species (heart ≫ soleus > plantaris > gastrocnemius > EDL = TA) (Fig. 3 A). The abundance of mtSSB mRNA, as compared with that of 28 S rRNA, was up-regulated after only 1 day of chronic motor nerve stimulation of the rabbit tibialis anterior and increased further between 3 and 7 days of stimulation (Table I). Thus, singificant changes in expression of mtSSB accompany activity-induced amplification of mitochondrial genomes in this model.Table IRNA yields and mtSSB mRNA expression in electrically stimulated rabbit TA musclesDuration of stimulationmtSSB mRNARNA yieldmtSSB mRNAAU/28 S rRNAμg RNA/gAU/mgControl13 ± 3247 ± 2931 ± 71 days42 ± 10*492 ± 39*208 ± 38*3 days56 ± 13*524 ± 103*295 ± 27*7 days36 ± 2*932 ± 47*333 ± 16*14 days41 ± 10*1384 ± 395*570 ± 208*21 days42 ± 2*1789 ± 245*758 ± 71* Open table in a new tab The mouse mtSSB cDNA probe detected only a single mRNA of 650 bases on Northern blots prepared with mouse cardiac RNA (Fig. 3 C). The relative expression of this RNA species was increased more than 3-fold within the first 10 days of post-natal life. Cardiac mtDNA concentrations increased more than 4-fold between day 5 and day 20 post-partum. 3S. Swoap and R. S. Williams, unpublished results. In mammalian cells, replication of mtDNA takes place preferentially within a subset of mitochondria clustered within a perinuclear domain (12Davis A.F. Clayton D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We observed that mtSSB protein is not distributed uniformly within all mitochondria of murine C2C12 myogenic cells but is more abundant within perinuclear regions (Fig. 4). Mitochondria within cell processes more distant from the nucleus are devoid of mtSSB, at least at the level of detection of this immunofluorescent technique. The principal observation of this study is that expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial DNA replication factors in mammalian cells is regulated in a differential rather than a coordinated manner. Expression of mRNA encoding the catalytic subunit of POLγ is constitutive among specialized tissues that differ markedly in their relative contents of mtDNA. Likewise, we could detect no appreciable up-regulation of POLγCAT mRNA in skeletal muscles subjected to chronic motor nerve stimulation, a potent stimulus to mtDNA replication. Other investigators have noted constitutive expression of POLγCAT mRNA and protein in human tumor cells depleted of mtDNA by exposure to ethidium bromide as compared with the parental cell line (22Davis A.F. Ropp P.A. Clayton D.A. Copeland W.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2753-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells, therefore, appear to lack a feedback mechanism to respond to a deficiency of mtDNA by up-regulation of POLγCAT gene expression. In contrast, expression of mtSSB mRNA correlates directly with the abundance of mtDNA within specialized muscle subtypes. This relationship is consistent in three independent analyses: (a) the comparison of different striated muscles within adult animals, (b) the response of the rabbit tibialis anterior skeletal muscle to chronic motor nerve stimulation, and (c) post-natal development of the murine heart. We conclude that expression of the mtSSB gene, unlike the POLγCATgene, is regulated by developmental cues or physiological stimuli that promote changes in mitochondrial biogenesis. Preliminary immunoblot analyses3 indicate that mitochondria-rich striated muscles contain greater amounts of mtSSB protein, corresponding to the changes in mtSSB mRNA described in this paper. Moreover, we demonstrate here that mtSSB is preferentially localized to a perinuclear subset of mitochondria that are active sites for mtDNA replication (12Davis A.F. Clayton D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). How should these findings be interpreted with respect to the biochemical and molecular mechanisms that govern replication and maintenance of mtDNA in mammalian cells? Constitutive expression of the POLγCAT gene in tissues with differing requirements for mtDNA replication suggests that, under physiological conditions, the enzymatic activity of POLγ is not constrained by limited expression of this subunit. Indeed, in a previous study we observed an increased specific activity of POLγ in mitochondria-rich muscle tissues (21Annex B.H. Williams R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5671-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) in comparison with glycolytic muscles that we now show to express a comparable abundance of POLγCAT mRNA. We cannot exclude the possibility that the abundance of the catalytic subunit of POLγ is regulated independently of changes in its mRNA through mechanisms that modify translational efficiency or stability of the protein. A more likely explanation, however, is that the availability of other mtDNA replication factors, and not POLγCAT, is rate-limiting to mtDNA replication. Our observation that the cellular content of mtDNA is not increased when the POLγCAT gene is amplified and overexpressed supports this viewpoint. The abundance of mtSSB could influence the cellular content of mtDNA in one of several ways. Since the activity of purified POLγ is stimulated by mtSSB in vitro (10Williams A.J. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 860-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 11Hoke G.D. Pavco P.A. Ledwith B.J. Van Tuyle G.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it is possible that expression of mtSSB likewise is rate-limiting to mtDNA replicationin vivo. Alternatively, higher concentrations of mtSSB may increase the stability of mtDNA, particularly under conditions where partially replicated D-loop forms of the mitochondrial genome are abundant (21Annex B.H. Williams R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5671-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The consistent correlation between expression of the mtSSB gene and the cellular content of mtDNA among different mammalian tissues supports the notion that increased intramitochondrial concentrations of mtSSB are required for, even if not the primary regulatory determinant of, the greater abundance of mtDNA in cells faced with high physiological demands for mitochondrial respiration.

Because the Gli family zinc finger domain has been shown to mediate DNA binding to the 9-bp consensus motif GACCACCCA, it is believed that GLI, GLI2, and GLI3 bind identical or similar DNA sequences, and understanding the specificity of function and their specific roles in the Sonic hedgehog-Patched signaling pathway will require an understanding of their transcriptional regulatory properties and the mechanisms responsible for their transcriptional regulation (17Kinzler K.W.

To begin to understand the function of GLI in the Sonic hedgehog-Patched signaling pathway and its mechanism of action, we have studied its transcriptional regulatory properties in tissue culture and identified contributions of specific domains to transcriptional regulation. We find that GLI activates reporter gene transcription through the SV40 promoter and the E1b promoter in a concentration-dependent manner. A transcription activation domain is identified at the carboxyl terminus of the protein which includes an 18-amino acid acidic α-helix highly similar to the herpes simplex viral protein 16 (VP16) transcription activation domain, which targets TAFII31 and DrosophilaTAFII40 (20Goodrich J.A.

A similar domain is present in the other Gli family proteins. The presence of a VP16-like activation domain in GLI provides a mechanism for transcriptional regulation. pCMV-GLI was prepared by inserting the full-length human GLI cDNA into theHindIII/XbaI site of the pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen). pCMV-GLI(−)TAD was prepared by deleting a 1,409-bp AccI fragment from the 3′-end of GLI. pCMV-GLI(−)AT was prepared by removing a 661-bpHindIII/XhoI fragment from the 5′-end ofGLI. pM-GLI was prepared by inserting aHincII/XbaI fragment of the human GLIcDNA into the SmaI/XbaI site of the pM plasmid (CLONTECH). pM-GLI515–1106 was prepared by inserting an SmaI/XbaI fragment of human GLI cDNA into the SmaI/XbaI site of the pM plasmid (CLONTECH). pM-GLI1–210 was constructed by inserting polymerase chain reaction-amplified human GLI cDNA corresponding to amino acids 1–210 into the EcoRI/XbaI site of the pM plasmid. pM-GLI78–686 was constructed by removing theAccI fragment from the pM-GLI vector. Two reporter constructs containing the consensus GLI DNA binding motif were prepared, pCAT-GLI44 and pCAT-GLI44(−)E. pCAT-GLI44 was prepared by inserting two tandem copies of the 44-bp GLI DNA binding motif (sense strand: 5′-GATCTAAGAGCTCCCGAAGACCACCCACAATGATGGTTGTATGT-3′) into theBglII site of the pSVCAT control plasmid (Promega) (17Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 634-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). pCAT-GLI44(−)E was prepared by removing aHincII fragment, which contains the SV40 enhancer sequence, from pCAT-GLI44. The control reporter construct lacking the SV40 enhancer, pCAT control(−)E, was prepared similarly from pSVCAT control (Promega). The pG5CAT reporter was obtained fromCLONTECH. DNA subfragments of pM-GLI515–1106, representing serial deletions from the carboxyl terminus, were prepared using exonuclease III/S1 nuclease digestion (23Henikoff S. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2829) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of these cDNA clones was determined using the dideoxy chain termination procedure (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52284) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated using Tri reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.). 10 μg of total RNA was incubated with 1 × 105 cpm of the antisense probe. After overnight hybridization at 45 °C, unhybridized RNA was digested with an RNase A/T1 mixture. Protected RNA fragments were analyzed on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and were visualized by autoradiography. In vitro translation of pCMV-GLI was completed using nuclease-treated reticulocyte lysate (Ambion Inc.). In vitro translation of pCMV-GLI(−)TAD and pCMV-GLI(−)AT were completed using wheat germ extract (Promega). The newly synthesized proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide. Nuclear extracts were prepared from 2–4 × 107 cells, and the protein concentration of each extract was determined (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (212413) Google Scholar, 26Dignam J. Lebovitz M. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9135) Google Scholar). 5 μg of each nuclear extract was mixed with 2.5 μl of 2 × binding buffer (20% glycerol (v/v), 20 mm MgCl2, 200 μm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 20 μm ZnSO4), H2O, and 0 or 1 μl (1.75 pmol) of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide (27Aruga J. Yokota N. Hashimoto M. Furuichi T. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1880-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated on ice for 5–10 min. 1 μl (8.75 fmol) of the double-stranded 32P-labeled probe (sense strand: 5′-GATCTAAGAGCTCCCGAAGACCACCCACAATGATGGTTGTATGT-3′) was added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for an additional 30 min. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis, and retarded bands were visualized by autoradiography. A total of 4 μg of DNA was transfected in each cotransfection experiment using the GLI DNA binding domain-containing reporters, including 1 μg of reporter plasmid, 1 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega), or pSV-luciferase (Promega) transfection efficiency control plasmid, 0–1 μg of effector plasmid, and pBluescript carrier DNA (Stratagene) in an amount to make up the difference. For the mammalian one-hybrid experiments using the pM-GLI-expressing effector constructs and the pG5CAT reporter construct, a total of 4 μg of DNA was transfected in each experiment, including 0.4 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.4 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega) transfection efficiency control plasmid, 0–3.125 μg of pM-GLI-expressing effector plasmid, and pBluescript carrier DNA (Stratagene) in an amount to make up the difference. In each case the DNA was mixed with 9 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent in 0.3 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), incubated for 45 min at room temperature, and then added to individual 60-mm plates containing 2 ml of Opti-MEM and 4 × 105cells. Cells were incubated for 5 h in a CO2 incubator before the Opti-MEM was replaced with HeLa culture media. Cells were incubated for 48 h, and lysates were prepared for CAT assays and β-galactosidase assays (Promega). CAT assays were performed as described by the manufacturer (Promega) with minor modifications. CAT activity was quantitated by scintillation counter and was normalized by measuring β-galactosidase activity spectrophotometrically (Promega) or by measuring luciferase activity (Promega) with a luminometer. HeLa cells were cotransfected with a GLI-expressing effector construct (pCMV-GLI) and a CAT reporter (pCAT-GLI44(−)E), under the control of the SV40 promoter, containing two tandem copies of a previously identified GLI DNA binding motif, GATCTAAGAGCTCCCGAAGACCACCCACAATGATGGTTGTATGT (17Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 634-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). This binding motif, which includes a 9-bp consensus sequence (underlined) identified in all three of the previously identified GLI DNA binding motifs, was selected because it may contain critical binding elements absent from the consensus 9-bp sequence. GLI mRNA was demonstrated in the transfected cells and in the positive controlGLI- amplified D259 MG glioblastoma multiforme cell line using RNase protection analysis (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–5). No evidence for GLI mRNA expression was found in HeLa cells or in HeLa cells transfected with the control plasmid pcDNA3 (data not shown). Because GLI3 has been shown to bind to the identical site as GLI and may compete with GLI for binding sites, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to look forGLI3 expression in HeLa cells. No GLI3 expression was found in HeLa cells (data not shown). A predicted 150-kDa GLI protein was produced off the pCMV-GLI effector usingin vitro translation (Fig. 1 B). Gel mobility shifts were used to demonstrate binding of the GLI protein to the GLI DNA binding motif in the reporter. Nuclear protein extract isolated from HeLa cells, which do not express GLI, demonstrated no mobility shift (data not shown). Nuclear protein extract isolated from the positive control cell line D259 MG and HeLa cells transfected with pCMV-GLI demonstrated two shifted bands using the 44-bp GLI DNA binding motif present in the reporter construct as a probe (Fig. 1 C). As increasing amounts of the GLI-expressing effector construct were cotransfected with a constant amount of the CAT-containing reporter construct (pCAT-GLI44(−)E), CAT activity increased more than 6-fold in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1 D). To test additionally for the possibility of transcriptional repression by GLI, pLTR-GLI was cotransfected with pCAT-GLI44. pCAT-GLI44, which includes the SV40 enhancer, was selected because it has higher basal CAT activity than pCAT-GLI44(−)E, and repression might be detected more easily from the higher baseline activity. Using pCAT-GLI44, pLTR-GLI demonstrated only transcriptional activation with no evidence of transcriptional repression (data not shown). These results were confirmed using a GAL4-GLI fusion protein approach. HeLa cells were cotransfected with the pM-GLI effector construct producing a fusion protein consisting of the GAL4 DNA binding domain linked to near full-length human GLI (amino acids 78–1106) and the pG5CAT reporter construct containing five tandem copies of the GAL4 DNA binding motif linked to the CAT gene under the regulation of the E1b promoter. Again, as increasing amounts of the pM-GLI expression construct were transfected an increase in CAT activity was observed, this time more than 30-fold (Fig. 2). The control vector (pM) lacking theGLI cDNA did not show this increase. To understand better the mechanism of GLI-induced transcriptional activation, experiments were conducted to identify a transcription activation domain. First, 470 amino acids were deleted from the carboxyl terminus of the GLI protein (pCMV-GLI(−)TAD), and 220 amino acids were deleted from the amino terminus of the GLI protein (pCMV-GLI(−)AT) (Fig. 3 A). GLI(−)AT and GLI(−)TAD mRNA were demonstrated in HeLa cells transfected with the pCMV-GLI(−)AT and pCMV-GLI(−)TAD effector constructs using RNase protection analysis (Fig. 1 A, lanes 6 and 7). In vitro translation was carried out to demonstrate production of a predicted 120-kDa GLI(−)AT protein off the pCMV-GLI(−)AT effector construct and a 100-kDaGLI(−)TAD protein off the pCMV-GLI(−)TAD construct (Fig. 3 B). Binding of the truncated proteins to the GLI DNA binding motif in the reporter was demonstrated using gel mobility shift assays (Fig. 3, C and D). Nuclear protein extract isolated from HeLa cells transfected with pCMV-GLI(−)TAD demonstrated two specific shifted bands. pCMV-GLI(−)AT, however, consistently showed only a single shifted complex (Fig. 3 D). Cotransfection of HeLa cells with pCMV-GLI(−)TAD and pCAT-GLI44(−)E resulted in decreased transcriptional activation compared with wild type GLI (Fig. 3 E). In contrast, cotransfection with pCMV-GLI(−)AT and pCAT-GLI44(−)E resulted in a 6-fold increase in transcriptional activation compared with controls, a level of activation comparable to wild type GLI (Fig. 3 F). The data suggest that pCMV-GLI(−)AT may be more active than wild type GLI at lower concentrations. We then used the carboxyl-terminal region (amino acids 515–1106) containing the putative transcription activation domain to produce a GAL4 fusion protein to assess the ability of the carboxyl-terminal region to activate transcription of the CAT reporter. HeLa cells were cotransfected with the pM-GLI515–1106 effector construct and the pG5CAT reporter construct (Fig. 4 A). A 280-fold increase in CAT activity was seen, confirming that a transcription activation domain lies within this region at the carboxyl terminus of the GLI protein. Other regions of the GLI protein did not show transcriptional regulatory activity. In fact, fusion proteins consisting of the GAL4 DNA binding domain and either amino acids 1–210 of the GLI protein (pM-GLI1–210) or 78–686 of the GLI protein (pM-GLI78–686) showed no increase in CAT activity (Fig. 4 A). Together these data indicate that a transcription activation domain lies in the carboxyl-terminal region of GLI between amino acids 686 and 1106. To define the transcription activation domain more precisely we then made nested deletions from the carboxyl terminus of GLI using exonuclease III/S1 nuclease digestion (Fig. 4 B). Nested deletion products were sequenced, and their ability to drive CAT activity was measured. The smallest segment identified which was required for transcriptional activation included amino acids 1020–1091. The region from 1020 to 1091 includes a negatively charged α-helical 18-amino acid stretch (amino acids 1037–1054) containing six aspartate or glutamate residues. The α-helical region demonstrates 50% similarity with the VP16 α-helical transcription activation domain including conservation of the FXXφφ (F = phenylalanine; X = any residue; φ = any hydrophobic residue) general recognition element of acidic activation domains for TAFII31 and conservation of the three residues (Asp472, Phe479, and Leu483 in VP16, and Asp1040, Phe1048, and Leu1052 in GLI) that are believed to make direct contacts with TAFII31 (22Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). The region surrounding the GLI α-helix is proline-rich. Human GLI3 and DrosophilaCi demonstrate conservation of the FXXφφ consensus element and two of the three residues that are believed to make direct contact with TAFII31, whereas mouse gli2 demonstrates conservation of the FXXφφ consensus element and one of the three residues believed to make direct contact with TAFII31. We have demonstrated that the oncodevelopmental geneGLI functions as a transcriptional activator of the heterologous promoters SV40 and E1b in HeLa cells through the GLI consensus binding motif and the GAL4 consensus binding motif respectively, in a concentration-dependent manner. As increasing amounts of GLI were transfected into HeLa cells greater CAT activity was seen. No evidence for transcription repression was found. In-frame deletion of amino acids 686–1106 from the carboxyl terminus of the GLI protein resulted in reduced transcriptional activation by GLI with retention of DNA binding. This same region drove CAT activity using a GAL4 fusion protein approach. The smallest segment identified by our studies, which was necessary for GLI-induced transcriptional activation, included amino acids 1020–1091. Indeed, Ruppert et al. (28Ruppert J.M. Vogelstein B. Arheden K. Kinzler K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5408-5415Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) had suggested previously that the carboxyl-terminal acidic α-helical region of GLI including amino acids 1037–1055 may represent a transcription activation domain based on the fact that 6 of 19 amino acids in this region are aspartate or glutamate. Acidic activation domains of VP16, p53, and p65 have been shown to target TAFII31, and each of these acidic activation domains includes an FXXφφ motif felt to represent the TAFII31 consensus recognition element (22Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The FXXφφ motif is conserved in the GLI transcription activation domain. The VP16 activation domain undergoes an induced transition from a random coil to an α-helix upon binding to its target protein TAFII31, and three residues believed to make direct contacts with TAFII31 have been identified (22Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The three residues (Asp1040, Phe1048, and Leu1052) are conserved in the GLI transcription activation domain. These structural motifs identified in a region that we demonstrate to function as the GLI transcription activation domain suggests that the mechanism for GLI-induced transcriptional activation involves TAFII31 binding. Substitution of alanine for two of the residues believed to make direct contacts with TAFII31 in the VP16 activation domain (Phe479and Leu483) has been shown to reduce TAF binding affinity and transcriptional activation (22Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Substitutions in this region in the different Gli family members may affect their TAF binding and transcriptional regulatory properties. Conservation of Asp1037 and Gln1035 in each of the mammalian Gli family members in this region may be of significance for TAF binding. It is of interest that the VP16-like domain lies within a proline-rich region at the carboxyl end of the GLI protein. 20% of the amino acid residues in this region (amino acids 752–1081) are prolines. A number of transcription factors contain proline-rich domains that appear to function as transcription activation domains, and the proline-rich region could contribute to transcriptional regulation by GLI (29Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 30Bossone S.A. Asselin C. Patel A.J. Marcus K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2277-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We were able to eliminate the majority of the proline-rich domain, however, and maintain the transcriptional activation properties of GLI, suggesting that the VP16-like acidic α-helical domain rather than the proline-rich domain represents the critical transcriptional activation domain of GLI. Transcriptional activation was retained following in-frame deletion of amino acids 2–220 from the amino terminus of the GLI protein. At low effector concentrations pCMV-GLI(−)AT appeared to even enhance transcriptional activation relative to pCMV-GLI although overall achieved a comparable level of transcriptional activation compared with full-length pCMV-GLI. Interestingly, amino acids 68–135 have been identified previously as a region of similarity between Gli family proteins showing 66% amino acid identity between GLI (amino acids 68–135) and GLI3 (amino acids 279–348) (28Ruppert J.M. Vogelstein B. Arheden K. Kinzler K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5408-5415Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Included within this region of GLI (amino acids 67–82) is a conserved domain that has been shown to be functionally significant in Caenorhabditis elegans TRA-1 and has been called the GF or “gain of function” region. Mutations in this region abolish negative regulation of TRA-1 activity (32deBono M. Zarkower D. Hodgkin J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Based on the TRA-1 data, conservation of the region in GLI and GLI3, and our current functional experiments, it is possible that the “GF region” at the amino-terminal end of GLI and its immediate vicinity represents an inhibitory domain in GLI as well. Also unique to GLI(−)AT was the fact that it consistently demonstrated a single shifted complex on gel mobility shift assay compared with wild type GLI, which consistently demonstrated two shifted bands. Two shifted protein complexes may result from partial proteolysis, differing states of protein phosphorylation or glycosylation, or possibly from protein interactions. Removal of the AT region may affect any of these processes. It has been suggested that mammalian Gli family members function in theSonic hedgehog-Patched pathway similarly to Ci in theDrosophila hedgehog-patched signaling pathway (15Johnson R.L. Rothman A.L. Xie J. Goodrich L.V. Bare J.W. Bonifas J.M. Quinn A.G. Myers R.M. Cox D.R. Epstein E.H. Scott M.P. Science. 1996; 272: 1668-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar, 33Dominguez M. Brunner M. Hafen E. Basler K. Science. 1996; 272: 1621-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Decapentaplegic (dpp) represents one of the downstream targets of Ci in this pathway (33Dominguez M. Brunner M. Hafen E. Basler K. Science. 1996; 272: 1621-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). It is believed that low concentrations of Ci repress dpp expression and high concentrations of Ci induce expression of dpp with Ci acting as a repressor or activator of transcription depending on its concentration (33Dominguez M. Brunner M. Hafen E. Basler K. Science. 1996; 272: 1621-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Recently it has been demonstrated that the 155-kDa Ci protein may be cleaved, resulting in a 75-kDa form that includes the amino terminus through the zinc finger domain but lacks the entire carboxyl end, which includes the transcription activation domain (34Aza-Blanc P. Ramierez-Weber F.-A. Laget M.-P. Schwartz C. Kornberg T.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). This 75-kDa form of Ci then functions as a transcription repressor. Using our in vitro assay conditions we can provide no evidence that GLI functions as a transcription repressor over a wide range of concentrations. It is possible that the three mammalian Gli genes, GLI, GLI2, and GLI3 function cooperatively to carry out comparable functions to ci in the mammalian Sonic hedgehog-Patched signaling pathway. Indeed, it has been shown recently that GLI activates the HNF-3β enhancer whereas GLI3 represses the HNF-3β enhancer (8Sasaki H. Hui C.-C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1997; 124: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Differences in TAF binding or binding affinity could potentially contribute to these different properties. Alternatively it is possible that the three mammalian genes have evolved to add increased layers of complexity to transcriptional regulation in the mammalian Sonic hedgehog-Patched signaling pathway. Transcription factors are generally considered to be modular, made up of several functional domains. The GLI protein represents an interesting example with each functional module conserved through different evolutionary lines. The GLI protein contains a conserved zinc finger domain found in Drosophila ci and C. elegans tra-1, a conserved 3′-untranslated region translation control element conserved in C. elegans tra-2, and now a conserved transcription activation domain found in herpes simplex virus VP16 (35Jan E.

Transglutaminases (EC 2.3.2.13) represent a family of enzymes capable of stabilizing protein assemblies by γ-glutamyl-ε-lysine cross-links. Enzymes of this family catalyze a Ca2+-dependent transfer reaction between the γ-carboxamide group of a peptide-bound glutamine residue and various primary amines, most commonly the ε-amino group of lysine residues (1Folk J.E.

Sensitive and specific assays are needed to detect the transglutaminase gene products that potentially contribute to biological events. To address this issue, we have developed an assay based on PCR amplification using degenerate primers specific for the transglutaminase gene family. Analysis of human cells and tissue revealed, besides five of the known gene products including TGC, band 4.2 protein, the a-subunit of factor XIII, TGK and TGP, a novel transglutaminase gene product, TGX. In the present study, we describe the full-length cDNA sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of two splice variants of this novel human gene. Oligonucleotides and restriction enzymes were from Oligos Etc. Inc. (Wilsonville, OR) and Promega Corp. (Madison, WI), respectively. Reagents for cell culture were from Life Technologies, Inc. Human keratinocytes were isolated from neonatal human foreskin as described previously (24Allen-Hoffmann B.L. Rheinwald J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Primary keratinocyte cultures were established on mitomycin C-treated mouse Swiss 3T3 fibroblast feeder layers in 3 parts Ham's F12 plus 1 part Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 8.4 ng/ml cholera toxin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 24 μg/ml adenine, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and antibiotics (100 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin). To induce differentiation, cells were harvested by trypsinization and cultured for the indicated time in suspension in the same medium supplemented with 1.68% methylcellulose (4,000 centipoises; Fisher Scientific Corp.)

For experiments analyzing the effect of cell density and growth factors on differentiation, cells were grown for one passage on a feeder layer in the absence of EGF. Subsequently, cells were grown for 24 h in the absence of a feeder layer before supplementing the medium with 0.5 nm EGF, 0.5 nm keratinocyte growth factor (KGF; Promega), or 10 μl of 0.1% bovine serum albumin/ml of medium for the indicated time (25Hines M.D. Allen-Hoffmann B.L.

Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from about 106 cells or 10 μg total RNA by oligo(dT)-cellulose column chromatography using the Micro-Fast Track Kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and recovered in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. The poly(A)+ RNA (5.0 μl) was reverse transcribed into DNA in a total volume of 20 μl using the cDNA Cycle Kit (Invitrogen) with either 1.0 μl of random primers (1 μg/μl) or oligo(dT) primer (0.2 μg/μl). No difference in the amount or nature of the PCR product was observed when the reverse transcription was done with random or oligo(dT) primers. cDNA from human prostate carcinoma tissue was kindly provided by Dr. Erik J.

Plasmid DNA was prepared with the Wizard Minipreps DNA Purification System (Promega) and sequencing performed by the dideoxy chain termination method using the Sequenase Version 2.0 Kit (U. S.

Double-stranded cDNA was prepared from poly(A)+ RNA (prepared as above) of cultured normal human keratinocytes with the Copy Kit (Invitrogen) using the oligo(dT)-NotI oligonucleotide (see Fig. 2) to prime first strand synthesis.

The membrane was hybridized with the probe at 42 °C overnight, washed with a final stringency of 0.1 × SSC, 1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min, and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak, Rochester, NY) for the indicated time period. cDNA was prepared as described above and a 225-bp fragment of TGX was amplified from 1.0 μl of cDNA with specfic primers S4 and S9 (Table II) using the PCR conditions described above except for annealing at 60 °C. To analyze the expression of transglutaminases when starting material is limited, we undertook an effort to design primers capable of specifically amplifying transglutaminase sequences by PCR. Alignment and comparison of the different known transglutaminase gene products on the nucleotide level revealed several conserved regions, particularly in the catalytic core domain (Table I; see also Fig. 7), that could serve as targets for primers. A single set of degenerate oligonucleotide primers (Table I) that amplify by PCR a 230-bp DNA fragment encoding the highly conserved active site region of transglutaminases (Fig. 1) was identified by screening of oligonucleotides based on different conserved regions in PCR reactions using plasmid DNA of different transglutaminases. The primers are based on the sequence YGQCWVFAGV (see Fig. 7, aa 274–283 in TGX), which includes the active site cysteine residue, and WM_RPDLP_G (aa 342–351) (Table I). Initial attempts with shorter oligonucleotides (18 bp) designed after the conserved sequences LFNPWC (see Fig. 7, aa 138–143 in TGX), QCWVFA (aa 276–281), and WNFHVW (aa 333–338) were unsuccessful. Also, degenerate oligonucleotides based on the sequence WQ_LDATPQE (see Fig. 7, aa 355–364 in TGX) and F_LLFNPWC (aa 135–143) did not yield PCR products.Figure 1Amplification of transglutaminases from different human cell lines or tissues. A 230-bp fragment corresponding to the active site of transglutaminases was amplified with degenerate primers D1 and D2 (Table I) by RT-PCR from MG-63 osteosarcoma cells (lane A2), HEL erythroleukemia cells (lane B1), platelets (lane C1), keratinocytes (lane D1), and prostate carcinoma tissue (lane E1). Cleavage of the PCR products with restriction enzymes revealed the type of transglutaminase expressed: ScaI, TGC; BstEII, band 4.2 protein; EcoRI, factor XIII a-subunit; Bsp1286I, TGK; and Tth111I, TGP. In osteosarcoma cells, ScaI (lane A3), Bsp1286I (lane A4), and ScaI + Bsp1286I (lane A5) reveal TGC and TGK; in erythroleukemia cells, ScaI (lane B2), BstEII (lane B3), and ScaI + BstEII (lane B4) reveal TGC and band 4.2 protein; in platelets, EcoRI (lane C2), ScaI (lane C3), and EcoRI + ScaI (lane C4) reveal the a-subunit of factor XIII and TGC; in keratinocytes, Bsp1286I (lane D2) reveals TGK; and in prostate carcinoma tissue, Tth111I (lane E2), ScaI (lane E3), Bsp1286I (lane E4), and EcoRI (lane E5) reveal TGP, TGC, TGK, and the a-subunit of factor XIII. DNA fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels calibrated with the 1-kb DNA ladder (lane A1; Life Technologies, Inc.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A facile method to identify the nature of the PCR products amplified with the degenerate primers is restriction analysis. Restriction sites conserved among species for a particular transglutaminase gene but not present in PCR products derived from other members of the gene family allow identification. Based on a comparison of the sequence information of transglutaminases for man, the following restriction enzymes gave cleavage patterns diagnostic of the six different human gene products: ScaI for TGC, BclI and NcoI (AvaI) for TGE, BstEII for band 4.2 protein, EcoRI for factor XIII a-subunit, Bsp1286I and NcoI for TGK, and Tth111I for TGP (Fig. 1). This selection of restriction enzymes would also work with known rat or mouse sequences. We selected different human cells or tissues that are known to express a distinct transglutaminase gene product to test whether we could amplify all gene products of the transglutaminase family. Sequence information for all six characterized genes is only available in man. TGC is expressed in many cell types and tissues in the vertebrate body (14Gentile V. Saydak M. Chiocca E.A. Akande O.

In fibroblasts and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, only TGC was detectable (results not shown), wheras MG-63 osteosarcoma cells expressed TGC and TGK (Fig. 1 A). Band 4.2 protein is a membrane cytoskeleton component expressed at a high level in erythroid cells (30Korsgren C. Lawler J. Lambert S. Speicher D. Cohen C.M.

For this reason, a human erythroleukemia cell line (HEL) was tested. Erythrocytes are also known to express significant amounts of TGC (2Lorand L. Conrad S.M. Mol. Cell.

We have named the gene containing this open reading frame GYP1. Recombinant Gyp1p showed GAP activity on Sec4p, increasing both its steady-state rate and single turnover GTPase activity. Gyp1p also stimulated the GTPase activity of several other yeast Rab proteins including Ypt1p, Ypt7p, and Ypt51p but showed no GAP activity on Ypt6p and Ypt32p. Deletion of the GYP1 gene or overexpression of Gyp1p did not alter the growth rate of yeast. However, overexpression of Gyp1p was inhibitory in combination with a subset of secretory mutants includingsec4-8 and several ypt1 mutants. This effect is probably due to the increase in GAP activity, which can be observed in a lysate from cells overexpressing Gyp1p. The finding that yeast Rab GAPs share homology with proteins in other species, such asCaenorhabditis elegans and human, suggests the existence of a conserved Rab GAP family.

GTP binding proteins cycle between the GTP-bound active form and the GDP-bound inactive form. The interconversion between these two forms depends on the rates of guanine nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis. Both of these reactions are intrinsically slow. But in the cell, they are catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; ORF, open reading frame; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. respectively (1Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). Rab proteins constitute the largest family of small GTP-binding proteins (2Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Eleven genes encoding Rab proteins (SEC4, YPT1, YPT31, YPT32, YPT51, YPT52, YPT53, YPT6, YPT7, YBR264C, and YNL304W) are found in yeast where they play important roles in vesicle transport. For example, Sec4p, the first Rab protein to be implicated in vesicle traffic, is involved in the last stage of the secretory pathway in yeast (3Salminen A. Novick P.J. Cell. 1987; 49: 527-538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). When the function of Sec4p is blocked, cells accumulate Golgi-derived secretory vesicles. GAP activities for Rab proteins have been observed for a long time (4Tan T.J. Vollmer P. Gallwitz D. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 5Burstein E.S.

Biol. 1992; 12: 2017-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A yeast protein called Gyp6p was the first Rab GAP to be cloned (7Strom M. Vollmer P. Tan T.J. Gallwitz D. Nature. 1993; 361: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It specifically activates the GTPase activity of Ypt6p and Ypt7p. To date, the only other Rab GAP that has been identified in yeast is Gyp7p (8Vollmer P. Gallwitz D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which is also active on Ypt7p. Recently, a mammalian GAP specific for the Rab3 subfamily was purified and cloned (9Fukui K. Sasaki T. Imazumi K. Matsuura Y. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4655-4658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This protein has no homology to the yeast GAPs and appears to have no homolog in the yeast genome. A Sec4p-specific GAP activity in the membrane fraction of a yeast lysate was previously observed (6Walworth N.C. Brennwald P. Kabcenell A.K. Garrett M. Novick P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2017-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To facilitate cloning the Sec4p-specific GAP, we searched the sequence data base and found an uncharacterized yeast ORF that shares homology with Gyp6p, Gyp7p, and a family of proteins from other species. In this paper, we demonstrate that this protein is a GAP for Sec4p. The construct for expressing His6-tagged Sec4p was described in Ref. 10Collins R.N. Brennwald P. Garrett M. Lauring A. Novick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18281-18289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar. The coding regions of other yeast Rab proteins used in this study and Gyp1p were synthesized by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into pET15b (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI), so that they were all tagged with six histidine residues at their N termini. Recombinant fusion proteins were induced for 2 h at 37 °C with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, except that Gyp1p was induced for 4 h at 25 °C. Purification was performed with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA), following the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. All of the purified Rab proteins were more than 90% pure, as judged by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels. Because Gyp1p was degraded in the cell or during purification, some truncated forms ranging from 60 to 70 kDa co-purified with the 70-kDa full-length protein. Guanine nucleotide analysis and charcoal binding method were performed as described previously (6Walworth N.C. Brennwald P. Kabcenell A.K. Garrett M. Novick P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2017-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out at room temperature. The concentrations of Rab proteins were defined by their [35S]GTPγS binding capacity. The concentration of recombinant Gyp1p was determined by Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as standard. For the analysis of nucleotide product, [α-32P]GTP was incubated for 20 min with Sec4p in buffer A (50 mm Na-HEPES, pH 6.8, 1 mm ATP, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 5 mm MgCl2. Gyp1p in the same buffer was added at zero time. Samples were taken at 0 and 30 min, and the nucleotides were resolved by thin layer chromatography. The steady-state rates were measured by directly adding Sec4p into the reaction mix containing buffer A, 5 mm MgCl2and excess [γ-32P]GTP. For the measurement of single turnover rate, Sec4p and Ypt6p were preloaded with [γ-32P]GTP in buffer A containing 5 mmMgCl2; Ypt1p, Ypt7p, Ypt32p, and Ypt51p were preloaded in buffer A containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmMgCl2. The assay mix contained Buffer A, 5 mmMgCl2 and 1 mm unlabeled GTP. We adopted a method similar to the so called Intergenic Flip Flop (11Mallet L. Jacquet M. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1351-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) to produce in one experiment both a disrupting cassette and a plasmid for gap repair. Two regions upstream and downstream of the Gyp1p open reading frame were polymerase chain reaction amplified from genomic DNA. They were either inserted into a centromere-based plasmid in the same orientation as in genomic DNA for the cloning of GYP1 by gap repair or inserted into an integrating plasmid in the opposite orientation for the disruption of GYP1. Transformations were performed by the lithium acetate method (12Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar). The integration of the disrupting cassette was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. The GYP1 gene rescued by gap repair was subcloned into 2μ plasmid for the overexpression of Gyp1p in yeast. Cells were grown overnight to log phase in minimal media plus 1% casamino acid (for yeast transformed with 2μ GYP1 plasmid, and for gyp1deletion mutant), or in minimum media plus 1% casamino acid and uracil (for wild type yeast). After washing once with 10 mmNaN3, the cells were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 1 mmbenzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Equal volumes of glass beads were added, and cells were broken by vortexing 5 × 1 min at 4 °C, with a 1-min interval in between on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 450 × g for 3 min. Supernatants were used in the GAP activity measurement. The protein concentration of lysate was determined by the Bradford method and adjusted to 12 mg/ml. 30 μl of lysate or lysis buffer were added to 170 μl of reaction mix containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 μm Rab proteins preloaded with [γ-32P]GTP. Samples were taken at 0, 30, 60, and 90 min and diluted into ice-cold stop buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2). [γ-32P]GTP remaining Rab-associated was determined by the filter binding method (13Kabcenell A.K. Goud B. Northup J.K. Novick P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9366-9372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A computer homology search revealed that the two known yeast Rab GAPs, Gyp6p and Gyp7p, share limited homology in two regions. BLAST data base search (14Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar) with the peptide sequences from these two regions demonstrated that many other proteins share sequence homology in these two motifs (Fig. 1 A). Among them is an unknown yeast ORF, YOR070C. Its predicted protein sequence consists of 637 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 73.3 kDa and a predicted isoelectric point of 6.98. We termed this protein Gyp1p, because it possesses GAP activity for Ypt1p and Sec4p. A C. elegans ORF F32B6.h is probably the homolog of Gyp1p in this organism. The two motifs used in the BLAST search are conserved perfectly between Gyp1p and F32B6.h (Fig. 1 B). We also found some human expressed sequence tags that showed very strong homology to Gyp1p and F32B6.h. The homology shared among them is not confined to the two motifs. For example, a stretch of amino acids close to the C-terminal end of Gyp1p matched very well to the sequences in theC. elegans and human homologs (Fig. 1 B). Gyp1p was prepared as a His6-tagged protein fromEscherichia coli. Thin layer chromatography analysis of the GTPase reaction product showed that Gyp1p stimulates the hydrolysis of Sec4p-bound [α-32P]GTP to GDP, but Gyp1p itself does not have GTPase activity (Fig. 2 A). Because of its low intrinsic GTPase activity, Sec4p cycles between the GTP-bound and GDP-bound states very slowly. Therefore, the steady-state rate of GTP hydrolysis by Sec4p alone was almost unmeasurable by the charcoal binding method (Fig. 2 B). Addition of Gyp1p stimulated the rate dramatically, suggesting that the hydrolysis step is a rate-limiting step in the cycle. This is consistent with the fact that Sec4p has a relatively fast intrinsic exchange rate (13Kabcenell A.K. Goud B. Northup J.K. Novick P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9366-9372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the highest steady-state rate in this experiment was achieved by the addition of both Gyp1p and Sec2-59p, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Sec4p (15Walch-Solimena C. Collins R.N. Novick P.J. J. Cell. Biol. 1997; 137: 1495-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), indicating that Sec4p undergoes the GTP-binding/GTPase cycle most efficiently in the presence of both its GAP and guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Under single turnover conditions, concentrations of Gyp1p as low as 1.2 ng/μl, which we estimate to represent a maximal molar concentration of 17 nm, were sufficient to enhance the GTPase activity of 1.4 μm GTP-Sec4p (Fig. 2 C), and the initial slopes of the curves in Fig. 2 C are directly proportional to the Gyp1p concentration, clearly indicating the catalytic nature of the interaction. The maximal enhancement of the rate of GTP single-round hydrolysis in this experiment was greater than 200-fold. Gyp6p was shown to be active on Ypt6p and Ypt7p but not on Sec4p or Ypt1p (7Strom M. Vollmer P. Tan T.J. Gallwitz D. Nature. 1993; 361: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To test the substrate specificity of Gyp1p, we prepared the recombinant proteins that covered most of the characterized yeast Rab proteins or subfamilies, including Sec4p, Ypt1p, Ypt6p, Ypt7p, Ypt32p, and Ypt51p. The Sec4p GTPase-deficient mutant Sec4L79p was also included in this analysis. As shown in Table I, the GTPase activities of Sec4p, Ypt1p, Ypt7p, Ypt51p, and Sec4L79p were strongly activated by Gyp1p. The same amount of Gyp1p has no significant effect on the GTPase activities of Ypt6p and Ypt32p.Table ISubstrate specificity of Gyp1pGTPaseGTPase activity (fmol/min)Activation ratio−Gyp1p+Gyp1pSec4p9.4086291.7Ypt1p16.195459.2Ypt6p2.424.631.92Ypt7p13.873153.0Ypt32p19.718.10.919Ypt51p25.954120.9Sec4L79p0.88758.966.4 Open table in a new tab To assess the functional significance of Gyp1p, the gene encoding Gyp1p was deleted by replacing the coding region with URA3. Thegyp1 deletion mutant cells grow normally at 25, 16, or 37 °C. Overexpression of Gyp1p from a high copy plasmid has no effect on the growth of wild type yeast cells either. However, when the high copy plasmid containing GYP1 was transformed into secretory mutants, the restrictive temperatures of some mutants were lowered (Table II), indicating a synthetic inhibitory effect. As shown in Table II, the growth ofsec4-8 and all three ypt1 mutants was inhibited by the overexpression of Gyp1p. Most of the other mutants whose growth were inhibited have functional and/or genetic interaction withSEC4 or YPT1. For example, Sec2p is the exchange factor for Sec4p; Bet2p is one subunit of the prenyl transferase essential for the membrane attachment of Sec4p and Ypt1p.Table IIGrowth properties of mutants transformed with 2μ vector or plasmid containing GYP12μ vector control2μGYP1Inhibitory effect25 °C30 °C34 °C37 °C25 °C30 °C34 °C37 °Cypt1–2++++++±−Yesypt1–3+++±++±−Yesypt1ts+++−++−−Yesbet2–1+++±++±−Yessec12–4++−−++−−sec13–1++−−++−−sec16–2+−−−+−−−sec20–1+±−−+±−−sec21–1++−−+±−−Yessec22–3+±−−+±−−sec23–1++−−+±−−Yessec7–1++−−++−−sec14–3+++−++±−Yessec1–1++−−++−−sec2–41++−−+±−−Yessec4–8+±−−±−−−Yessec3–2+++−+++−sec6–4++−−++−−sec8–9+++−+++−sec10–2+++−+++−sec15–1+++−++−−Yessec9–4++−−++−−sec17–1++±−++±−sec18–1+−−−+−−−sec19–1++−−++−− Open table in a new tab Lysates were prepared from wild type yeast, from yeast transformed with the 2μ GYP1 plasmid, and from the gyp1 deletion mutant. The GAP activity for Sec4p, Ypt1p, and Ypt6p in the lysate was measured by the filter binding method (Fig. 3). Compared with the wild type yeast lysate, the lysate from yeast transformed with 2μ GYP1plasmid was more active on Sec4p and Ypt1p but not on Ypt6p, indicating that in vivo overexpression of Gyp1p increases the GAP activity on Sec4p and Ypt1p. This result is consistent with the substrate specificity data obtained with recombinant Gyp1p and suggests that the inhibitory effect of the 2μ GYP1 plasmid on secretory mutants is likely to be caused by the increase of GAP activity. The lysate from the gyp1 deletion mutant showed only a moderate decrease of GAP activity for Sec4p and Ypt1p, implying that Gyp1p is probably not the only GAP for Sec4p and Ypt1p in yeast and is not the major source of the observed GAP activity in a wild type yeast lysate. We demonstrate here that a yeast protein that shares two conserved motifs with a family of proteins, including the two known yeast Rab GAPs, Gyp6p and Gyp7p, is a GAP that acts on Sec4p, Ypt1p, Ypt7p, and Ypt51p. The homology shared by the members of this protein family is not extensive but rather confined to the two motifs, which may be the reason why the homology between Gyp6p and Gyp7p was not previously recognized. The fact that Gyp1p was identified by this homology and proved to be a Rab GAP leads us to hypothesize that all the members of this protein family are likely to have a common biological function, i.e. they have GAP activity for Rab proteins. Furthermore, it is tempting to speculate that the two conserved motifs are parts of the catalytic domain, because GAPs for the Ras and Rho family members share the common catalytic domains specific for each family (1Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). This possibility is being explored experimentally. It is of interest to mention that two arginine residues in the second motif are conserved among all members of this protein family, in light of the finding that arginine residues play important roles in the catalytic activity of Ras and Rho GAPs (16Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Nurmahomed K. Owen D. Laue E. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Nature. 1997; 388: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 17Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesm uuml, ller, L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). In the yeast genome, Gyp1p is the only ORF that we found to share significant homology with Gyp6p and Gyp7p. During the preparation of this manuscript, a more extensive sequence similarity between Gyp6p, Gyp7p, and many other proteins including cell cycle proteins Bub2p and Cdc16p has been described, using a less stringent searching algorithm (18Neuwald A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 243-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Many residues conserved in the protein family we defined here, such as the two arginine residues mentioned above, are not conserved in those more distantly related proteins. However, the weak homology shared between Rab GAPs and cell cycle checkpoint proteins may have some functional implication. Because the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rab proteins is very low, GAPs are necessary to convert them from their GTP-bound forms to their GDP-bound forms. It is not clear at which point in the functional cycle of Rab proteins the bound GTP is hydrolyzed. Studies on Rab3a have shown that hydrolysis occurs during exocytosis (19Stahl B. von Mollard G.F. Walch-Solimena C. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24770-24776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies using an XTP-binding mutant of Rab5 have suggested that Rab5 continually cycles between GTP- and GDP-bound forms on the vesicle (20Rybin V. Ullrich O. Rubino M. Alexandrov K. Simon I. Seabra M.C. Goody R. Zerial M. Nature. 1996; 383: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Regardless of where hydrolysis normally occurs in the cell, overexpression of GAPs may down-regulate the level of activated Rab proteins, as is evidenced by our genetic data demonstrating inhibitory effects of Gyp1p overexpression. In addition, Rab GAPs have been hypothesized to aid the process of Rab prenylation, due to the preference of Rab escort protein for the GDP-bound form of Rab proteins. However, the phenotype ofgyp1 deletion mutant does not suggest such a role. Because GAPs may be needed at more than one stage of the Rab protein functional cycle, it is conceivable that in the cell there are several GAPs that may act on a single Rab proteins. That Gyp1p, the only known GAP for the essential yeast Rab proteins Sec4p and Ypt1p, is not necessary for the growth of yeast may imply that there are yet unknown GAPs that play redundant roles or that Gyp1p performs a function not required in the normal growth phase. Our results showing that overexpression of Gyp1p inhibits the growth of sec4, ypt1, and some other secretory mutants support the idea that Rab GAPs negatively regulate the function of Rab proteins and decrease the efficiency of vesicular transport. Our lab has previously identified a Sec4p-specific GAP activity in the membrane fraction of yeast lysate (6Walworth N.C. Brennwald P. Kabcenell A.K. Garrett M. Novick P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2017-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A competition assay showed that the activity can be specifically inhibited by excess Sec4p but not Ypt1p, implying specificity for Sec4p. Because Gyp1p is active on both Sec4p and Ypt1p, it probably does not account for the membrane-associated Sec4p GAP activity. Purification and cloning of other Sec4p-specific GAPs should enhance our understanding of the functional mechanism of Rab proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2021353301,"We have demonstrated previously that microtubule depolymerization by colchicine in human monocytes induces selective production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) (Manié, S., Schmid-Alliana, A., Kubar, J., Ferrua, B., and Rossi, B. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 13675–13681). Here, we provide evidence that disruption of the microtubule structure rapidly triggers extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, whereas it was without effect on SAPK2 activity, which is commonly acknowledged to control pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This process involves the activation of the entire cascade including Ras, Raf-1, MEK1/2, ERK1, and ERK2. Activation of ERKs is followed by their nuclear translocation. Although other SAPK congeners might be activated upon microtubule depolymerization, the activation of ERK1 and ERK2 is mandatory for IL-1 production as shown by the blocking effect of PD 98059, a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor. Additionally, we provide evidence that microtubule disruption also induces the activation of c-Src and Hck activities. The importance of Src kinases in the mediation of the colchicine effect is underscored by the fact that CP 118556, a specific inhibitor of Src-like kinase, abrogates both the colchicine-induced ERK activation and IL-1 production. This is the first evidence that ERK activation is an absolute prerequisite for induction of this cytokine. Altogether, our data lend support to a model where the status of microtubule integrity controls the level of Src activities that subsequently activate the ERK kinase cascade, thus leading to IL-1 production.

Monocytes play an essential role in the inflammation as accessory cells for the processing and presentation of antigen to lymphocytes, but also in the inflammatory process by releasing oxygen metabolites, lysosomal enzymes, and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukins (ILs) 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; NF, nuclear factor; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MAP, microtubule-associated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; MEK, MAP kinase kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MBP, myelin basic protein. 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; NF, nuclear factor; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MAP, microtubule-associated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; MEK, MAP kinase kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MBP, myelin basic protein. 1 and 6. The regulation of the synthesis of these cytokines is complex, and still poorly understood. Bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharides), antigen-antibody complexes, phorbol esters (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), and cytokines are classical monocyte-activating agents which induce the concerted production of these pro-inflammatory cytokines. Recent studies have shown that alteration of the cytoskeletal network by chemical agents also induces a dramatic and specific increase of IL-1 (1Manié S. Schmid-Alliana A. Kubar J. Ferrua B.

Immunol. 1992; 149: 2459-2465PubMed Google Scholar) by monocytic cells.During recent years, growing evidence has accumulated showing that the cytoskeleton could intervene in the propagation of the mitogenic and activation signal (5Zigmond S.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In this respect, many studies have focused on the actin network that acts as a dynamic structure involved in the integrin-mediated signaling cascade (6Craig S.W. Johnson R.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic microtubules represent another major element of the cytoskeleton that have been implicated in diverse processes such as cellular motility, intracellular transport, and secretion. The fact that microtubules are subject to constant remodeling, because of the dynamic instability of tubulin dimers, prompted us to consider that the microtubule network may be an important actor in the transmission of activation signals inside the cell. This idea is supported by reports showing that: (i) microtubule reorganization, occurring during differentiation of HL 60 cells, is associated to tubulin phosphorylation on tyrosine residues (7Katagiri K. Katagiri T. Kajiyama K. Yamamoto T. Yoshida T. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) microtubule reorganization were also observed after cytokines and phorbol ester treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (8Molony L. Armstrong L. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 196: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); and (iii) microtubule disruption generates a signal that leads to NFκB activation (9Rosette C. Karin M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar).We and others have shown that microtubule-disrupting drugs are capable of generating a signal that leads to the selective induction of IL-1 synthesis in human monocytes (1Manié S. Schmid-Alliana A. Kubar J. Ferrua B. Rossi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13675-13681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Allen N.N. Herzyk D.J. Wewers M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L315-L321PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate that microtubule depolymerization was without effect on SAPK2 activity, which is generally considered as a key regulating enzyme in the production of cytokines (10Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2401) Google Scholar, 11Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J.

In contrast, we provide the first evidence that the colchicine-mediated microtubule disassembly can induce, by itself, the activation of the entire Ras-dependent cascade leading to ERK activation and their translocation to the nucleus. This cascade is in fact triggered by the upstream transient activation of c-Src and Hck. Owing to the selective effect of colchicine on IL-1 production, this study emphasizes the importance of the microtubule polymerization state in the control of the regulation it exerts on some Src-like kinases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Human Monocyte PreparationHuman myelomonocytic THP1 cells (ATCC) were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Biosepra), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (referred to as the complete medium).

Cells (107) were treated with or without the effectors for the indicated times at 37 °C and lysed in buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μmpepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5). The crude lysates were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were precleared with nonimmune serum prebound to protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for rabbit serum or protein G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for sheep serum. The precleared lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 16 h with antibodies raised against the various transduction proteins previously bound to protein A-Sepharose or to protein G-Sepharose.

In parallel, using specific antibodies, we immunoprecipitated ERK1, from unstimulated THP1 lysates, to be used as a substrate. The pellets containing MEK and ERK1, respectively, were then mixed in a final volume of 50 μl of MEK kinase buffer in the presence of 15 μm ATP. The reaction was started by addition of 100 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP. After addition of 25 μl of 9 × Laemmli sample buffer to stop the reaction, the samples were heated to 95 °C for 3 min.

The pellets containing Raf-1 or MEK were then mixed to a final volume of 50 μl of MEK kinase buffer in the presence of 15 μm ATP. The reaction was started by addition of 100 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP and stopped by addition of 25 μl of 9 × Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were heated to 95 °C for 3 min and split for analysis by autoradiography or Western blotting after separation by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions.Western Blotting AnalysisTotal cell lysates (100 μg), immunoprecipitated substrates, or nuclear proteins (100 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon membrane as detailed previously (15Schmid-Antomarchi H. Benkirane M. Breittmayer V. Husson H. Ticchioni M. Devaux C. Rossi B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The blots were probed with 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or anti-c-Src at 1 μg/ml, or with anti-ERK1, anti-ERK2, anti-SAPK2/P38, anti-Raf-1, anti-MEK-1, or anti-Hck (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 0.1 μg/ml, the proteins were visualized by the Amersham ECL system and quantified by densitometric scanning.Determination of Ras-GTP/Ras-GDP RatioTHP1 cells (7 × 105 cells/ml) were starved for 16 h in RPMI 1640 medium and subsequently labeled for 3 h at a concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml with 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (200 mCi/mmol, Amersham) in phosphate-free buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). Cells (107) were stimulated or not by colchicine (1 μm) for the indicated times at 37 °C and rapidly washed with phosphate-free buffer, before being lysed in buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μmpepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5). After 20 min, NaCl, SDS, and deoxycholate were added to a final concentration of 0.5 m, 0.5% and 0.05%, respectively. The crude lysates were centrifuged at 18 000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and the supernatants were precleared by incubation with rat nonimmune serum bound to protein G-Sepharose for 30 min. The treated lysates were then incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with anti-p21ras prebound to protein G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoprecipitates were collected and washed eight times with 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.005% SDS. GTP and GDP were finally eluted in 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 0.5 mm GTP, and 0.5 mm GDP at 68 °C for 20 min and separated on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Schleicher & Schüll), developed in 1.2 m ammonium formate, 0.8m HCl. Plates were exposed for autoradiography, and the GTP/GDP ratio was determined by densitometric scanning.DISCUSSIONSeveral lines of evidence support the idea that changes in the cell shape could trigger by itself a signal that leads to gene regulation (35Ingber D.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 1249-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In this regard, microtubules, the architecture of which undergoes a constant remodeling due to the dynamic instability of tubulin dimers, appear as a good candidate, susceptible to rapidly convert a structural change in a signaling pathway in response to external signals. We and others have reported previously that microtubule-disrupting agents can induce the synthesis and secretion of IL-1α and IL-1β in human monocytes/macrophages (1Manié S. Schmid-Alliana A. Kubar J. Ferrua B. Rossi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13675-13681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Allen N.N. Herzyk D.J. Wewers M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L315-L321PubMed Google Scholar) at the exclusion of the other inflammatory cytokines. This model provides thus a valuable tool to unravel the signaling pathways that selectively control IL-1 production.In this study, we first ascertained by means of run-on experiments that accumulation of the pro-IL-1β transcript, as evoked by microtubule depolymerization, relied on an increased transcription rate of pro-IL-1β mRNA. These data suggest that microtubule depolymerization not only controlled events occurring in the cytoplasmic compartment, but also conveyed a signal to the nucleus resulting in the activation of transcription factors necessary for the expression of the IL-1β gene. Along this line, the recent report showing that microtubule depolymerization could activate NFκB in HeLa cells (9Rosette C. Karin M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) is of particular interest, owing to the importance of this factor in the control of the IL-1β gene (36Hiscott J. Marois J. Garoufalis J. D'addario M. Roulston A. Kwan I. Pepin N. Lacoste J. Nguyen H. Bensi G. Fenton M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6240-6321Crossref Google Scholar).To gain information on the signal propagation from the microtubules to the nucleus, we focused our attention on the MAPK congeners that are known to play a key role in the activation of several transcription factors, including NFκB and NF-IL-6 (37Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa K. Sasaki K. Naruto M. Kishimuto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 38Park J.-H. Lewitt L. Blood. 1993; 8: 2470-2477Crossref Google Scholar). Several features of MAPKs substantiate an inter-relationship between the activation of this kinase family and microtubule remodeling: (i) about 40% of ERK1 and ERK2 are associated to the microtubules (39Reska A.A. Seger R. Diltz C.D. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8881-8885Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar); (ii) the best characterized cellular factors that regulate microtubule dynamics are MAPs, phosphorylation of which by MAPKs has been proposed to play a major role in the microtubule growing/shrinking balance (40Belmont L.D. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 623-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar).Owing to the important role that was ascribed to SAPK2/P38 activity in the control of the LPS-induced IL-1 production (11Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fischer J.E. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adam J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3119) Google Scholar), we first investigated the possibility that this subfamily of MAPKs was also involved in the colchicine-induced IL-1 up-regulation. However, we found that no SB 203580-sensitive activity was recovered in anti-SAPK2/P38 immunopellets, ruling out a possible involvement of this type of activity in the mediation of the colchicine effect. In contrast, ERK1 and ERK2 were activated upon microtubule disruption following two distinct kinetic profiles. ERK2 appears to be activated transiently, while ERK1 was activated in a more sustained fashion. These kinetic profiles perfectly matched the respective translocation pattern of the two MAPK species to the nucleus. We demonstrated that not only ERK1 and ERK2 were activated, but activators situated upstream, such as MEK-1, Raf-1, and Ras, were also stimulated upon microtubule depolymerization with a kinetic profile compatible with that observed for ERK activation. cAMP-dependent protein kinase has been found to be activated upon microtubule disruption (1Manié S. Schmid-Alliana A. Kubar J. Ferrua B. Rossi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13675-13681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,2Allen N.N. Herzyk D.J. Wewers M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L315-L321PubMed Google Scholar), and this could lead to directly activate ERK activity as reported in some systems (41Lenormand P. Sardet C. Pages G. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Pouysségur J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 42Nguyen T.T. Scimeca J.C. Filloux C. Peraldi P. Carpentier J.L. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9803-9810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest instead that the activating effect of colchicine on ERKs does stem from the activation of the entire MAPK cascade, rather than the mere activation of ERK via cAMP-dependent protein kinase. We cannot exclude the possibility that other SAPK congeners such as SAPK1/JNK1, SAPK3, and SAPK4 (43Kumar S. McDonnell P.C. Gum R.J. Hand A.T. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) are also activated in response to colchicine treatment. However, when THP1 cells were exposed to PD 98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK-1 (22Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar), and by way of consequence a blocker of the ERK1/ERK2 pathway, we totally blocked the stimulatory effect of the vinca-alkaloid on the expression of IL-1β RNA. These data provide the first evidence that activation of ERK activities is a mandatory condition for the up-regulation of IL-1β transcription. This agrees well with the notions that (i) MAPK dramatically up-regulates NF-IL-6 transactivating activity through phosphorylation of its Thr-235 residue (37Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa K. Sasaki K. Naruto M. Kishimuto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and (ii) NF-IL-6 plays an essential role in the induction of the human pro-IL-1β gene by interacting with motifs situated on upstream and proximal regions of the promoter (44Tsukada J. Saito K. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7285-7297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In an attempt to understand the mechanism by which microtubule disruption could activate Ras or acts on a step situated upstream, we investigated a possible involvement of tyrosine kinase activity(ies), which have been shown to act as potent activators of Ras through the Grb-2/Sos pathway (45Park R.K. Liu Y. Durden D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13342-13348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 46Smith L. van der Horst Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8564-8569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was supported by (i) the observation that tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as herbimycin or genistein abolished the colchicine-induced IL-1β transcription; and (ii) the fact that pervanadate, a potent inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases, synergized with the activating effect induced by suboptimal concentration of colchicine. When THP1 cells were exposed to colchicine, they exhibited a complex tyrosine phosphorylation pattern including a set of phosphoproteins migrating in the range of 55–60 kDa that was reminiscent of tyrosine kinases of the Src type. We could indeed demonstrate that both c-Src and Hck tyrosine kinase activities were transiently stimulated with a time course compatible to that observed for the activation of the MAPK cascade. Activation of c-Src and Hck was found to be of crucial importance for the mediation of the colchicine effect since addition of CP 118556, which inhibits Src-like kinase activities (34Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow L.R. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.L. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar), also abrogated the increase in IL-1β transcription induced by microtubule disruption. When we looked to other members of the Src kinase family expressed in THP1 cells, we found that exposure to colchicine had no effect on the level of Fyn activity while that of Lyn was slightly decreased (data not shown), thus suggesting that, depending on their degree of assembly, tubulin dimers exert a fine regulation among the Src tyrosine kinase congeners. Although colchicine treatment does not correspond to a physiological condition, modulation of microtubule stability does occur under physiological or pathological conditions. For instance, adherence of avian marrow macrophages to fibronectin or vitronectin-coated surfaces that is known to reorganize the microtubule network has been reported to induce the association of c-Src to polymerized tubulin in a tyrosine kinase independent manner (47Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.-P. Schlessinger P. Tondravi M.M. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Additionally, we could demonstrate that pretreatment of THP1 cells with CP 118556 abrogated at the same time c-Src activity and ERK1 and ERK2 activities, strongly suggesting that, consecutive to microtubule disruption, c-Src acts as a positive regulator situated upstream of the ERK activities.In conclusion, microtubule disruption by vinca-alkaloids appears as a valuable tool to decipher the pathways specifically involved in IL-1 gene regulation in human monocytes, which points to a major role played by the Src-triggered ERK cascade under colchicine treatment. Given that SAPK2 was shown to be essential for the production of the IL-1 under LPS stimulation, our data suggest that, depending on the site inflammatory stimulus, IL-1 production might be controlled by distinct MAPK congeners. Monocytes play an essential role in the inflammation as accessory cells for the processing and presentation of antigen to lymphocytes, but also in the inflammatory process by releasing oxygen metabolites, lysosomal enzymes, and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukins (ILs) 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; NF, nuclear factor; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MAP, microtubule-associated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; MEK, MAP kinase kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MBP, myelin basic protein. 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; NF, nuclear factor; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MAP, microtubule-associated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; MEK, MAP kinase kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MBP, myelin basic protein. 1 and 6. The regulation of the synthesis of these cytokines is complex, and still poorly understood.

By engineering appropriate recombinant shuttle vectors, it is feasible to examine mutations by transient or stable transformation of T. gondii parasites, in bacterial and yeast complementation assays, and through biochemical analysis of purified enzyme. A series of mutant alleles that mirrorP. falciparum variants reveals that the key mutation Asn-108 (Asn-83 in T. gondii) probably confers resistance to pyrimethamine by affecting critical interactions in the ternary complex. Mutations such as Arg-59 (T. gondii 36) have limited effect in isolation, but in combination with other mutations they enhance the competitive ability of folate by increasing the speed of product turnover. Val-16 (T. gondii 10) confers low level resistance to cycloguanil but hypersensitivity to pyrimethamine. This mutation precludes Asn-108, probably because compression of the folate binding pocket introduced by this combination is incompatible with enzyme function. These studies permit detailed biochemical, kinetic, and structural analysis of drug resistance mutations and reconstruction of the probable phylogeny of antifolate resistance in malaria.

Among protozoan pathogens of clinical significance, Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium sp. share a common evolutionary history (as members of the phylum Apicomplexa) (1Levine N.D. J. Protozool. 1988; 35: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and a vulnerability in folate metabolism, which forms the basis for effective drug treatment (2Brooks R.G. Remington J.S. Luft B. Antimicrob. Agents Annu. 1987; 2: 297-306Google Scholar, 3Dannemann B. McCutchan J.A. Israelski D. Antoniskis D. Leport C. Luft B. Nussbaum J. Clumeck N. Morlat P. Chiu J. Ann. Int.

These parasites lack the ability to salvage pyrimidine nucleosides from the host cell and are capable of only limited salvage (of uracil) from their own pool of metabolites (5Schwartzman J.D. Pfefferkorn E.R. J. Parasitol. 1981; 67: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 6Reyes P. Rathod P.K. Sanchez D.J. Mrema J.E. Rieckmann K.H. Heidrich H.G. Mol. Biochem.

They therefore depend heavily on de novobiosynthetic pathways that consume reduced folate molecules as methyl donors in reactions involving 1-carbon transfer. This necessitates that rapidly dividing parasites maintain an abundant folate pool. A key enzymatic step in folate metabolism is the NADPH-dependent reduction of folate to H2-folate and further reduction of H2-folate to H4-folate. These reactions are catalyzed by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) 1The abbreviations used are: DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; TS, thymidylate synthase. 1The abbreviations used are: DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; TS, thymidylate synthase. (4Hitchings G.H. Hitchings G.H. Inhibition of Folate Metabolism in Chemotherapy. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1983: 1-20Google Scholar). As in other protozoa (and plants), DHFR occupies the NH2-terminal portion of a homodimeric bifunctional protein in bothToxoplasma and Plasmodium, fused at the COOH terminus to thymidylate synthase (TS) (8Roos D.S.

TS and DHFR catalyze sequential steps in the regeneration of methyl-charged folate molecules, and coupling of these two activities within a single protein is thought to facilitate channeling of H2-folate from TS to DHFR (10Ivanetich K.M. Santi D.V. Exp. Parasitol. 1990; 70: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11Trujillo M. Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Greene P.J. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6366-6374Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Antifolate chemotherapy for the treatment of malaria, toxoplasmosis, and many other infectious diseases relies on the combination of folate analogs to inhibit DHFR (pyrimethamine, trimethoprim, cycloguanil, etc.) with sulfonamides to inhibit a prior step in folate biosynthesis (2Brooks R.G. Remington J.S. Luft B. Antimicrob. Agents Annu. 1987; 2: 297-306Google Scholar, 3Dannemann B. McCutchan J.A. Israelski D. Antoniskis D. Leport C. Luft B. Nussbaum J. Clumeck N. Morlat P. Chiu J. Ann.

Mechanisms of acquired resistance, and the metabolic cost of resistance, are issues of considerable importance in medical and biological science.

Reports of clinical treatment failures caused by acquired pyrimethamine resistance in Toxoplasma are rare, probably because the drug-resistant mutations in humans are unlikely to be transmitted from one individual to another.

We have demonstrated previously that certain DHFR polymorphisms observed in Fansidar-resistantPlasmodium falciparum confer pyrimethamine resistance in transgenic T. gondii parasites (43Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11703-11707Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 44Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and we have therefore chosen to examine a wider variety of such alleles in this experimentally accessible system. Plasmodium DHFR-TS shares greater primary amino acid sequence identity with Toxoplasmathan it does with any other species whose DHFR or TS genes have been examined to date (8Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6269-6280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The objectives of this study are to clarify the mechanistic effects of DHFR point mutations in drug-resistant malaria and to gain insights into the biochemical characteristics of T. gondii DHFR and its role in drug susceptibility and resistance. By engineering a suitable set of recombinant shuttle vectors, it has proven feasible to examine in vivo and in vitrothe phenotypes associated with a variety of DHFR-TS mutations using transient or stable transformation of T. gondii parasites, bacterial (and yeast) complementation assays, and biochemical analysis of purified enzyme. These studies extend previous findings on the suitability of Toxoplasma as a model for certain aspects ofPlasmodium biology, revealing how the interaction of drug and enzyme is disrupted by naturally occurring mutations. Vectors used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. Manipulation of recombinant DNA and bacterial transformation was accomplished according to standard protocols. E. coli strain DH5α was used for routine cloning and plasmid propagation. A uniqueBamHI site was introduced slightly upstream of the ATG initiation codon in a bacterial expression vector containing T. gondii DHFR-TS (43Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11703-11707Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), to produce plasmid placZDHFR-TS. A 1-kilobase BamHI-EcoRI fragment harboring the complete DHFR coding sequence was excised from this plasmid and introduced into the pKS(−) vector (Stratagene) for site-directed mutagenesis (45McClary J.A. Whitney F. Geisselsoder J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 282-289PubMed Google Scholar) using the following synthetic oligonucleotides (underlined nucleotides indicate introduced mutations, and mutated codons are shown in bold): 5′-tctacggggcgttgtcggatccgggaagATGCAGAAACC-3′ (upstream BamHI site; coding sequence shown in uppercase); 5′-GTGTCTGGTCGTCGTGATGACCCCCAAGA-3′ (Val-10); 5′-GATTTCAAACACTTTCG TCGTGTGACAAAAACGGAC-3′ (Arg-36); 5′-ATGGGACGGAAAAACTGGGAAAGCATGCCT-3′ (Asn-83); 5′-ATGGGACGGAAAAGCTGGGAAAGCATGCCT-3′ (Ser-83); 5′-GGTACCCTACGACTCCGTGGTTCTCGAGAAG-3′ (Ser-245). Polymerase chain reaction-based methods were avoided to minimize the possibility of introducing unintended mutations, and all mutants were confirmed by sequencing across the entire targeted region. DHFR sequences, mutated as described in the text, were then returned to the placZDHFR-TS vector for expression as transcriptional fusions in E. coli or introduced in place of the wild-type DHFR locus in plasmid pDHFR-TSc3 (43Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11703-11707Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) for expression in transgenic T. gondii parasites. For overexpression in bacteria and purification of recombinant enzyme, DHFR domain mutants (produced as described above) were introduced into apET15b-based vector (11Trujillo M. Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Greene P.J. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6366-6374Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) using a slightly smaller cassette (AgeI-XhoI). E. coli strain LH-18 (Δlac-pro supE hsdR5 thyA Δfol::Kan F′lac [Iq-ZΔM15] + pro +) (46Howell E.E. Forster P.G. Forster L.M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3040-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was used for complementation analysis of the various T. gondiiDHFR-TS alleles (in plasmid placZDHFR-TS). The capacity of mutagenized alleles to complement the fol −phenotype was determined on minimal media in the absence of folate supplements (methionine, glycine, thymidine, adenine, and pantothenic acid) (46Howell E.E. Forster P.G. Forster L.M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3040-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 47Singer S. Ferone R. Walton L. Elwell L. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 470-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effect of DHFR-TS mutations on drug resistance in tissue culture, wild-type RH-strain tachyzoites (14Roos D.S. Donald R.G.K. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) were transfected withpDHFR-TSc3 vectors harboring various mutant alleles of interest. Two × 107 parasites + 30 μg of CsCl-purified plasmid DNA were mixed in 2-mm gap electroporation cuvettes (BTX), subjected to a ∼0.25-msec pulse (1.5 kEV, 24 ohms) and inoculated into confluent monolayers of human foreskin fibroblast cells in 24-well plates in modified Eagle's medium + 1% heat-inactivated, dialyzed fetal bovine serum (14Roos D.S. Donald R.G.K. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 43Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11703-11707Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The viability and proliferation of transiently transfected parasites grown in various concentrations of pyrimethamine were measured 24–36 h post-transfection by [3H]uracil uptake assay (14Roos D.S. Donald R.G.K. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 48Pfefferkorn E.R. Pfefferkorn L.C. J. Protozool. 1977; 24: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These data were used for calculation of IC50 values. Wild-type pDHFR-TSc3 and a null allele in which the ATG initiation codon was mutated to TTG (43Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11703-11707Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) served as controls for transfection studies. Plasmid vector pET15b and E. colihost strain BL21(DE3)PLysS (Novagen) were employed for recombinant enzyme expression in 2-liter cultures. Induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purification were carried out essentially as described (11Trujillo M. Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Greene P.J. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6366-6374Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), with the following modifications: only soluble DHFR-TS protein was purified after induction; both affinity chromatography (on methotrexate-agarose; Sigma) and anion exchange chromatography (DE52; Whatman) were accomplished by gravity flow; and protein concentrations in crude and purified enzyme preparations were determined by Bradford assay. Enzyme purity was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and lack of contamination with folate derivatives was confirmed by assayingA 280/320 ratios. Purified enzyme was stored at −20 °C in 10% glycerol; no loss of enzymatic activity was detected during the course of this study. Kinetic parameters of enzyme produced from mutant T. gondii DHFR-TS alleles were determined spectrophotometrically at 25 °C under the steady-state conditions established previously for the wild-type enzyme (11Trujillo M. Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Greene P.J. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6366-6374Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). DHFR activity was measured as a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm in a 1.0-cm cuvette during a 2–3-min interval (results calculated using a molar extinction coefficient for NADPH of 12,000 m−1cm−1 at 340 nm). One unit of DHFR activity is defined as the amount of enzyme necessary to produce 1 μmol of product/min at 25 °C. Purified DHFR-TS fractions from different mutants were assumed to retain a uniform percentage of active enzyme (∼90%). Apparent K m values for H2-folate and for NADPH were determined while keeping the concentration of one substrate constant at 100 μm and varying the other, initially between 0.5 and 50 times the K m of wild-type enzyme and subsequently over a range encompassing concentrations 0.5–50 times the estimated K m of the mutant. All reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme at t = 0. Kinetic values for H2-folate and for NADPH were calculated on the basis of three to six independent experiments (observed variation between experiments was always ≤ 15%). K i values for the binding of pyrimethamine (Sigma) and cycloguanil (Jacobus Pharmaceutical Co., Princeton NJ) to wild-typeT. gondii DHFR-TS are consistent with expectations for tight binding inhibitors, complicating the calculation of inhibition constants (49Morrison J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 185: 269-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 50Cha S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1975; 24: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 51Morrison J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 102-105Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In contrast to certain antifolates (e.g.methotrexate; 51), pyrimethamine does not typically behave as a slow tight binding inhibitor (52Baccanari D.P. Joyner S.S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1710-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 53Stone S.R. Morrison J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 869: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); progress curves following inhibition of the T. gondii enzyme show that steady-state levels of inhibition are achieved rapidly and that initial velocities are proportional to inhibitor concentration over two logs. Inhibition ofT. gondii DHFR by pyrimethamine and cycloguanil meets established criteria for the use of transient-state kinetics to calculate inhibition constants for tight binding inhibitors (50Cha S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1975; 24: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), and K i values were therefore calculated from IC50 values under quasi-steady-state conditions (3–30 nm enzyme, 100 μm NADPH, 50 μmH2-folate, and various inhibitor concentrations) (Equations 6–9 in Ref. 50Cha S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1975; 24: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Lineweaver-Burk plots were used to determine the mode of inhibition by pyrimethamine, examining ligand competition under conditions where [inhibitor] ≪ [enzyme] and [H2-folate] = 0.5–10 × K m. These were the only conditions under which double-reciprocal plots displayed linearity, supporting the conclusion that such plots are inappropriate for computation ofK i values. The structure of T. gondii DHFR-TS was modeled on an IRIS Indigo XZ4000 using the Homology module of the molecular graphics package Insight II (Biosym Technologies). The primary structures of T. gondii and Leishmania majorDHFR-TS proteins were aligned using a PAM250 matrix to identify possible conserved regions. Coordinates were assigned to T. gondii residues using the 2.9 Å L. major x-ray structure (generously provided by Dr. D. A. Matthews) (54Knight D.R. Kan C.C. Howland E. Janson C.A. Hostomska Z. Welsh K.M. Matthews D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and loop structure between conserved domains was assigned by root mean square distance minimization. Energy minimization for the T. gondiienzyme and pyrimethamine inhibitor was performed to convergence using the Insight II Discover module. As noted above, there is a strong correlation between resistance to pyrimethamine (and cycloguanil) in malaria and specific amino acid substitutions in the parasite's DHFR protein sequence (15Cowman A.F.

To investigate the effects of these amino acid substitutions on antifolate resistance, we constructed a large series of mutant T. gondii DHFR-TS alleles, including mutants analogous to wild-type and drug-resistant P. falciparum strains (Table II). Mutagenesis was carried out using a bacterial plasmid containingT. gondii DHFR and junctional domain coding sequence, which could be excised conveniently as a cassette for insertion into bacterial complementation and parasite transformation vectors encoding the complete DHFR-TS enzyme (Fig. 1).Table IDHFR-TS polymorphisms in P. falciparumPolymorphic locusAmino acid residueRef.Characteristics16Ala9Bzik D.J.

https://openalex.org/W1978029487,"A cysteine-to-phenylalanine mutation of residue 116 in the third transmembrane domain of the β2-adrenergic receptor caused selective constitutive activation of Na+/H+ exchange through a pathway not involving cAMP. This selectivity was identified by comparing binding and signaling characteristics of wild-type (WT)versus C116F mutant receptors transiently transfected into COS-1 cells. Indicating constitutive activity, ligand binding to the C116F mutant showed a 78-fold higher than WT affinity for isoproterenol and a 40-fold lower than WT affinity for ICI 118551. Although agonist-independent activation of cAMP production was not exhibited by the C116F mutant, a constitutive stimulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1) was observed. This was identified by measuring either basal intracellular pH (pHi) or rate of pHi recovery from cellular acid load. Due to a higher rate of H+ efflux through NHE1, C116F transfectants exhibited a significantly higher pHi (7.42) than did WT transfectants (7.1). Furthermore, the rate of pHi recovery from acid load facilitated by NHE1 was 2.1-fold faster in mutant transfectants than in WT transfectants. The lower rate seen in the WT case was stimulated by epinephrine, and the higher rate seen in the mutant case was inhibited by ICI 118551. These findings, which show that a C116F mutation of the β2-adrenergic receptor evokes selective constitutive coupling to NHE1 over cAMP, form the basis of our prediction that multiple and distinct activation states can exist in G protein-coupled receptors.

As with all G protein-coupled receptors, the common structural feature of this family is a single polypeptide chain with seven hydrophobic regions that constitute seven transmembrane-spanning domains. Classification of adrenergic receptors (α1, α2, and β), which as a family mediate the physiological effects of the sympathetic nervous system, is based on homology of amino acid sequences and pharmacology of various ligands (1Bylund D.B. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 832-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In the case of the β2-subtype, dogma suggests that the endogenous catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine promote receptor coupling to Gαs and downstream cAMP production (2Strosberg A.D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1198-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 3Kobilka B. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1991; 1: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Since β2ARs are most abundant in smooth muscle, the best characterized effects of cAMP activation include smooth muscle relaxation in bronchial tubes and in vascular tissue (4Hardman J.G. Limbird L.E. Molinoff P.B. Ruddon R.W. Goodman Gilman A. 9 Ed. The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1996: 125Google Scholar). The process of receptor activation and G protein coupling that evokes cellular effects is described by the widely accepted revised ternary complex model (5De Lean A. Stadel J.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7108-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this allosteric model, the active conformation of a native receptor is the cornerstone of the agonist-receptor-G protein complex that leads to signaling. Without agonist present, the model predicts spontaneous receptor isomerization between the inactive (R) and active (R*) conformations, with equilibrium under native conditions shifted toward R. At any given time, even though most receptors reside in R, a small population will reside in R*, permitting formation of the R*·G protein complex that causes effector activation. The model predicts that the addition of agonist does not directly convert the receptor from R to R*. Rather, the agonist will preferentially bind to receptors already in R*, thereby shifting isomerization equilibrium away from R. Receptor mutations that induce an agonist-independent shift in isomerization equilibrium toward the R* conformation are termed constitutively active and so by definition couple to and evoke second messenger responses in the absence of agonist. The studies contributing to the development of the revised ternary complex model were based primarily on the characterization of β2AR signaling, which was assumed to be through a single effector pathway (adenylate cyclase via coupling to Gαs). However, recent studies indicate that besides coupling to Gαs, β2ARs also couple to an alternate protein in the Gα family (possibly Gα13), which leads to newly discovered cellular effects, including stimulation of NHE1 (7Strader C.D.

Therefore, in the present study, β2AR signaling via both cAMP production and Na+/H+ exchange was examined in a receptor that was engineered to have a single amino acid mutation of Cys-116 in the third transmembrane domain. Cys-116 is situated approximately one helical turn below Asp-113, which is the putative counterion that binds the protonated amine of adrenergic ligands (11Dixon R.A.F. Sigal I.S. Strader C.D. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1988; 3: 487-497Crossref Google Scholar, 12Strader C.D. Gaffney T. Sugg E.E. Candelore M.R. Keys R. Patchett A.A. Dixon R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the important role of Asp-113 in ligand binding, any perturbation of the third transmembrane helix could affect both the ligand-binding pocket and second messenger coupling. Interestingly, the C116F mutation induces a receptor conformation that constitutively activates Na+/H+ exchange while only maintaining competent coupling to cAMP. This finding is similar to the result observed in an analogous C128F mutation of the α1bAR, which exhibits selective constitutive coupling to inositol metabolism over the arachidonic acid pathway (13Perez D.M. Hwa J. Gaivin R. Mathur M. Brown F. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 112-122PubMed Google Scholar). Work in our laboratory with C116F β2AR and C128F α1bAR has formed the basis of an emerging hypothesis suggesting that receptors are capable of forming multiple activation states that are G protein-specific. An understanding of conformational differences between these distinct states may eventually lead to the design of signaling-specific therapeutic agents. At least in the case of receptors that couple to more than one G protein, we suggest that the current model of receptor activation be revised to include isomerization from the R conformation to distinct active conformations that exhibit G protein selectivity. HEM buffer was composed of 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 1.4 mm EGTA, and 12.5 mmMgCl2. Fluorescence medium consisted of 125 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.7 mm CaCl2, 0.7 mm NaH2PO4, 0.8 mmNa2SO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 15 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 2 mml-glutamine, and 10 mmd-glucose. Potassium-based fluorescence medium was identical to fluorescence medium except that it contained 20 mm NaCl and 110 mm KCl. The cysteine-to-phenylalanine mutation was made at residue 116 of the human β2AR using cassette replacement as described previously (14Noda K. Saad Y. Graham R.M. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6743-6752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cDNAs were sequenced by the dideoxy method (Sequenase kit, Amersham Corp.) to confirm the mutation. The synthetic human β2AR was then subcloned into the eukaryotic expression plasmid pMT2′ (15Perez D.M. Piascik M.T. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 876-883PubMed Google Scholar) and purified. COS-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection), known to be βAR-negative based on the lack of epinephrine-evoked cAMP responses (16Perez D.M. DeYoung M.B. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 784-795PubMed Google Scholar), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) + 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were plated onto either 150- or 60-mm tissue plates for membrane preparations or second messenger studies, respectively, or onto UV-clear ΔT dishes (Bioptechs) for fluorescence assay. Transient transfection was achieved by the DEAE-dextran method (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.45-16.46Google Scholar). Efficiency of transfection was typically near 20%. Cells were harvested or assayed 60 h after transfection. COS-1 cell membranes were prepared as described previously (15Perez D.M. Piascik M.T. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 876-883PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216261) Google Scholar). Competition binding experiments with the antagonist radioligand [125I]CYP were carried out in a final volume of 0.25 ml containing HEM buffer + 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 150 pm[125I]CYP, COS-1 membranes, and varying concentrations of unlabeled ligand. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10−5m propanolol. Reactions were run at room temperature for 1 h, after which time the mixtures were filtered onto Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters using a Brandel cell harvester. Bound radioactivity was quantitated with a Packard Auto-gamma 500 counter. Binding data were analyzed with the iterative curve-fitting software package GraphPad Prism. Saturation binding studies were performed with increasing concentrations of [125I]CYP (5–600 pm) in the same buffer as used in competition binding experiments. To minimize variation, WT and C116F β2AR binding experiments were always performed simultaneously. Statistical significance in both binding and functional assays was identified by the two-tailed Student's ttest. Accumulation of cAMP in WT and C116F β2AR transfectants was measured using a commercially available cAMP assay system (Amersham Corp.) according to the directions supplied by the manufacturer. Cell extracts were derived from cultures in 60-mm dishes that were preincubated for 30 min with 5 mm theophylline and then for 30 min with both theophylline and increasing concentrations of agonist. Transfected COS-1 cells, cultured in ΔT dishes, were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 0.3 μm BCECF/AM (Calbiochem). Unincorporated dye was washed away by perfusion with fluorescence medium until extracellular fluorescence was undetectable. Intracellularly trapped BCECF fluorescence was measured with a Delta Scan dual wavelength spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International) functionally linked to an Olympus inverted fluorescence microscope. Cells were alternately excited with 440- and 500-nm light while the intensity of the 530 nm emission was measured with a photomultiplier tube. Emission intensities at the two exciting wavelengths were collected every 0.2 s during continuous perfusion of the cells with medium. Using an adjustable shudder, the emission from an area containing only 20–30 cells was collected for analysis. Cellular autofluorescence and contaminating fluorescence from leaked dye were found to be negligible, but background corrections were made to remove contributions from ambient light. Excitation ratios (500/440 nm) were calibrated for pHi with 10 μm nigericin in potassium-based fluorescence medium as described previously (19Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the averaged results of seven separate calibrations that indicate a linear relationship between the 500/440 nm ratio and pHi in the physiological range (pH 6.3–7.8). For each experimental ratio collected, a pHi value was extrapolated from this calibration plot. For certain experiments, cells were acid-loaded via a 6-min transient exposure to 20 mm NH4Cl (20Boron W.F. De Weer P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1976; 67: 91-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Rate of recovery of pHifrom this induced acidosis was determined by calculating the derivative of the slope of the pHi time course tracing for 10-s intervals through the first 120 s of recovery. Receptor density and [125I]CYP binding affinity were determined in COS-1 cells transfected with either the WT β2AR cDNA or the C116F mutant. [125I]CYP labeled an apparently homogeneous population of binding sites with similar affinity in membranes prepared from both transfected cell populations. Binding of the radioligand was statistically best fit to a one-site model with meanK D values for the WT and C116F receptors of 97.3 and 125.1 pm, respectively (data not shown). When transfecting cells cultured in 150-mm plates with 8 μg of plasmid DNA, the mean WT and mutant receptor densities were 0.398 and 0.058 pmol/mg, respectively. The potency of various ligands to inhibit specific [125I]CYP binding to membranes from WT or C116F receptor-transfected COS-1 cells is shown in Table I. β2-Agonists and partial agonists that were tested showed a 6–78-fold higher binding affinity for C116F mutant receptors than for WT receptors. The largest leftward shift in affinity for the mutant receptor was seen with the full agonists isoproterenol and epinephrine, which showed 78- and 49-fold lower K i values than for the WT receptor, respectively. Comparatively, the antagonists ICI 188551, pindolol, and alprenolol exhibited the binding properties of inverse agonism by showing a 3–40-fold higher affinity for the WT receptor than for the C116F mutant. The most dramatic shift was seen with ICI 118551, which showed a 40-fold higher K i for the mutant receptor. Propanolol, another antagonist tested, exhibited the binding properties of neutral antagonism by not showing a significantly differentK i for one receptor compared with the other.Table IPharmacological characterization of WT and C116F β2ARsLigandK iWT/C116FWT(S.E.)C116F(S.E.)mAgonists Isoproterenol1.2 × 10−7(±3.1 × 10−9)1.6 × 10−9(±7.6 × 10−11)781-aSignificant difference in K ibetween the WT and mutant receptors (p < 0.001).

Open table in a new tab The potential role of G protein precoupling in the observed shift of agonist affinity seen for the C116F mutant was examined by performing competition studies in the absence and presence of 0.1 mmGpp(NH)p. K i values and Hill coefficients for isoproterenol binding to mutant receptors were not affected by the presence of Gpp(NH)p (data not shown). Functional coupling of WT and C116F β2ARs to the cAMP pathway was examined by measuring accumulation of cAMP. For this experiment, the transfection protocol was modified to assure similar receptor expression levels in WT and C116F transfectants. This was accomplished by titering down the amount of WT cDNA introduced to the cells untilB max was approximately equal to values seen in the mutant case. Mean receptor expression in titered WT transfectants was 0.063 pmol/mg compared with 0.056 pmol/mg in mutant transfectants. Fig. 2 compares the isoproterenol concentration dependence of cAMP production in cells expressing similar levels of either WT or C116F receptors. Arguing against constitutive coupling to Gαs and cAMP production, the C116F mutant receptor did not evoke a response in the absence of isoproterenol, and it did not affect the potency of isoproterenol to evoke a response compared with the WT receptor. The agonist concentration curves seen in the two transfected cell populations were nearly identical, with mean EC50 values of 90.8 and 79.3 nm, respectively. Like isoproterenol, epinephrine concentration-response curves and EC50 values seen in WT and C116F transfectants were not different (data not shown). A possible alternative constitutive coupling of C116F β2ARs to Gα13 and downstream NHE1 was initially examined by studying the effect of this hypothetical constitutive activity on basal pHi. Continuous stimulation of H+ extrusion through the Na+/H+ exchanger by a constitutively active C116F mutant receptor would likely cause cytosolic alkalosis. Therefore, using basal pHi as a marker of constitutive activity, resting pHi levels in COS-1 cells were determined. Fig. 3 illustrates that C116F receptor-transfected cells had a significantly more alkaline pHi (7.42) than either WT transfectants (7.1) or untransfected cells (7.04). This was despite 6.8-fold more receptors on WT than on mutant cell membranes. As expected, intracellular alkalosis in the C116F transfectants was inhibited by inactivating the mutant receptors with the inverse agonist ICI 188551 (10−5m). The apparent constitutive coupling of the C116F β2AR to Na+/H+ exchange was further examined by measuring the rate of pHi recovery from cellular acid load. COS-1 cells transfected with either the WT or C116F β2AR cDNA were loaded with H+ by a 6-min exposure to 20 mm NH4Cl. Rate of recovery from this acid load (dpHi/dt) was compared in WT and C116F transfectants under various conditions. In an attempt to factor out effects on H+ extrusion rate caused by the ion's concentration gradient, comparisons were only made between groups of cells that loaded to a similar minimum pHi in the range between 6.35 and 6.4. A time course of the pHi changes that occur during acid load in C116F receptor-transfected cells is shown in Fig. 4. The initial alkalosis upon addition of NH4Cl was due to the rapid internalization of NH3 and its association with H+ to form NH4+ (20Boron W.F. De Weer P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1976; 67: 91-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 21Kohmoto O. Spitzer K.W. Movsesian M.A. Barry W.H. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 622-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Upon abrupt removal of the NH4Cl, intracellular NH4+ dissociates to form NH3, which rapidly leave the cells, and H+ions, which are retained intracellularly. Recovery of the cells from this acid load was detected as a net alkalinization of the cytosol. Also shown in Fig. 4, facilitation of this pHi recovery was confirmed to be NHE1-specific based on sensitivity to 50 mmdimethylamiloride (22Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C131-C145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The time course of pHi recovery following acid load was compared in COS-1 cells expressing either WT or C116F β2ARs. A significantly more rapid recovery was seen in C116F transfectants than in either WT transfectants or untransfected control cells (Fig. 5 A). As summarized in Fig. 5 B, cells expressing the mutant receptor showed a 2.1-fold higher dpHi/dt than WT transfectants. WT receptor-transfected cells and untransfected cells recovered from the acid load with a similar rate. Furthermore, activation of WT receptors with 10−6mepinephrine stimulated dpHi/dt to the rate seen in C116F transfectants, whereas treatment with 10−5m ICI 118551 had no effect. Comparatively, treatment of the C116F mutant receptor with 10−5m ICI 118551 significantly reduced dpHi/dt to a value near that seen in WT transfectants, whereas stimulation with 10−6m epinephrine had no effect. In the current revised ternary complex model describing the activation of G protein-coupled receptors (5De Lean A. Stadel J.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7108-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), agonists do not directly drive the inactive receptor to assume the active conformation. Rather, the model predicts that agonists will preferentially bind to a receptor's R* conformation, thus stabilizing R* and shifting the isomerization equilibrium away from R. Conversely, inverse agonists, which preferentially bind to R, promote receptor inactivation by shifting the equilibrium away from R* (23Chidiac P. Hebert T.E. Valiquette M. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 490-499Google Scholar, 24Samama P. Pei G. Costa T. Cotecchia S. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 390-394Google Scholar). Constitutively active mutant receptors that exhibit an increase in agonist affinity and/or a decrease in inverse agonist affinity do so because a shift in equilibrium toward the active conformation has already occurred. A mutation-induced shift of a receptor toward R* will, by definition, facilitate agonist-independent coupling to G proteins, thus causing constitutive activation of effector pathways. Based on these tenets of the model, the higher than WT binding affinity of common β2-agonists seen for the C116F β2AR (Table I) is strongly suggestive of constitutive receptor activity. Consistent with receptor theory (6Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the degree of high affinity shift was proportional to the intrinsic efficacy of the agonist tested. Also supporting this hypothesis, the β2-inverse agonist ICI 118551 exhibited a higher affinity for the WT receptor than for the C116F mutant (Table I). Again, it appears that the degree of shift to lower affinity was proportional to the inverse efficacy of the antagonist tested. ICI 118551, which is known to be a highly efficacious inverse agonist (24Samama P. Pei G. Costa T. Cotecchia S. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 390-394Google Scholar), showed the largest rightward shift in affinity for the mutant receptor (Table I). As expected, alprenolol and propanolol, which are classified either as weak inverse agonists (23Chidiac P. Hebert T.E. Valiquette M. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 490-499Google Scholar) or as neutral antagonists (24Samama P. Pei G. Costa T. Cotecchia S. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 390-394Google Scholar), exhibited smaller rightward affinity shifts. Overall, these changes in ligand binding affinity are intrinsic to the mutant receptor and are not due to altered G protein precoupling as evidenced by the inability of Gpp(NH)p to affectK i values or Hill coefficients (data not shown). The C116F mutation could evoke these shifts in ligand binding affinity in one of two ways. First, since the 116th residue is located in the third transmembrane domain only one helical turn below Asp-113, the counterion for the protonated amine of catecholamines (11Dixon R.A.F. Sigal I.S. Strader C.D. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1988; 3: 487-497Crossref Google Scholar, 12Strader C.D. Gaffney T. Sugg E.E. Candelore M.R. Keys R. Patchett A.A. Dixon R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it seems possible that it could indirectly affect interaction of the receptor with ligand per se. However, since the function of the receptor has also been altered and correlates to an activational paradigm, this scenario seems unlikely. Rather, we suggest that the mutation has affected receptor conformation to mimic the activated state. Since we have postulated that the equivalent mutation in the α1bAR (C128F) is involved in modulation of an important salt bridge constraint that stabilizes the inactive conformation (25Porter J.E. Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28318-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), it is possible to envision that C116F is influencing a similar constraining factor. Even though the binding data allude to a constitutive activity induced by the C116F mutation, agonist-independent generation of a second messenger signal must be identified to firmly establish this hypothesis. Classically, it is held that the β2AR evokes cellular effects through a coupling to cAMP production via Gαs (2Strosberg A.D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1198-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 3Kobilka B. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1991; 1: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Based on this, agonist-dependent and -independent effects on cAMP production were compared in WT and C116F receptor-transfected COS-1 cells. Not only did the C116F mutation fail to potentiate the isoproterenol dose response (EC50) relative to the WT receptor, it also failed to evoke a response in the absence of the agonist (Fig. 2). Similar results were seen with epinephrine (data not shown). These findings indicate that the C116F mutation does not facilitate constitutive coupling to Gαs. Rather, the mutant and WT receptors show equal competency in the generation of agonist-evoked cAMP responses. If the β2AR indeed only signals through a coupling to Gαs, these data would suggest that the C116F mutation affects ligand binding without inducing the receptor to assume an activated conformation that is competent to couple to a second messenger signal. As was mentioned, a coupling of β2ARs to Gαs has been convincingly established in the literature. Because of this, when studying β2-receptor pharmacology, the inclination has been to measure cAMP as a marker of G protein coupling. Over the past decade, however, a strong case for an alternate pathway has emerged. Early work by Strader et al. (7Strader C.D. Dixon R.A.F. Cheung A.H. Candelore M.R. Blake A.D. Sigal I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16439-16443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that β-receptor mutants, uncoupled from Gαs due to deletion of G protein-interacting domains (residues 222–229 and 258–270), exhibited marked increases in agonist affinity. Similarly, mutagenesis of Asp-130 (in the third transmembrane domain) also led to increases in agonist binding affinity despite receptor uncoupling from Gαs (26Fraser C.M. Chung F.-Z. Wang C.-D. Venter J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5478-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The Gαs-uncoupled 222–229 deletion mutant was later shown by Barber and Ganz (8Barber D.L. Ganz M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20607-20612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to activate Na+/H+ exchange via an unknown G protein. This study established the novel hypothesis that Gαs-independent cellular responses were evoked by β2ARs. Since then, Barber and co-workers (9Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Conklin B.R. Gilbert R.L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22902-22906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the codon-anticodon interaction definitely follows the mitochondrial wobble rule. In contrast, the mitochondrial gene encoding the tRNA that translates all AGN codons in starfish and sea urchin has the anticodon GCT (6Himeno H. Masaki H. Kawai T. Ohta T. Kumagai I. Miura K.-I.

The question that arises from this is how the GCT anticodon can recognize the AGA and AGG codons, in addition to AGY (Y = U, C), in echinoderms.We have previously speculated on possible answers to this question (1Osawa S. Evolution of the Genetic Code. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1995Google Scholar,2Osawa S. Jukes T.H. Watanabe K. Muto A. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 229-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Watanabe K. Osawa S. Soll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA Structure, Biosynthesis and Function. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 225-250Google Scholar). One possibility is that G at the first anticodon position of the starfish mt tRNAGCUSer might be modified so as to allow it to pair with all four AGN codons. Alternatively, it might be that a region(s) in the tRNA other than the anticodon influences the decoding ability of AGR codons, because most metazoan mt tRNAGCUSer have unusual secondary structures in which the D arm is lacking or incomplete (2Osawa S. Jukes T.H. Watanabe K. Muto A. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 229-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,17Watanabe K. Osawa S. Soll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA Structure, Biosynthesis and Function. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 225-250Google Scholar). This truncated D arm could be responsible for G·R pairing, in addition to G·Y pairing, between the anticodon and codons. Another feature is the G·C pair at the bottom of the anticodon stem, which is present in the tRNAGCUSer of mitochondria of invertebrates, but not in those of most vertebrates, in which its place is taken by an A·U pair (2Osawa S. Jukes T.H. Watanabe K. Muto A. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 229-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Watanabe K. Osawa S. Soll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA Structure, Biosynthesis and Function. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 225-250Google Scholar, 18Sprinzl M. Steegborn C. Hübel F. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Since tRNAGCUSer of all metazoan mitochondria except for that of nematode have identical anticodon loops (15Okimoto R. Macfarlane J.L. Clary D.O. Wolstenholme D.R. Genetics. 1992; 130: 471-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there could be some structural differences in regions other than the anticodon loop, depending on which codons, AGY (vertebrates) or AGN (N = A, G, C, or U) (invertebrates), are translated as serine.With the aim of determining which of these speculations is actually the case, the starfish mt tRNAGCUSerresponsible for the noncanonical decoding in the AGN codon box was purified and sequenced, and the modified nucleoside content was determined by electrospray liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (ES-LC/MS). The results showed the first of the speculations posited above to be correct; guanosine at the wobble position of starfish mt tRNAGCUSer has been completely converted to 7-methylguanosine (m7G). This strongly suggests that m7G is capable of base pairing with all four nucleotides, thus resulting in a genetic code change in echinoderm mitochondria. Based on the primary structure of the mt tRNAGCUSer, we also present a scenario that could explain evolutionary changes in the genetic code that have occurred in animal mitochondria.DISCUSSIONWe report here the first known occurrence of m7G at the wobble position of a tRNA. Even since we first discovered that in starfish mitochondria AGN codons seem to be translated as serine by the tRNAGCUSer from the sole corresponding gene located on the mt genome (6Himeno H. Masaki H. Kawai T. Ohta T. Kumagai I. Miura K.-I. Watanabe K. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the question as to how tRNAGCUSer possessing a GCU anticodon decodes all four AGN codons has attracted our interest, especially with regard to the decoding mechanism of mt tRNAs toward nonuniversal codons. This long-pending puzzle has now been solved by the finding that a modified residue (m7G) exists at the wobble position of tRNAGCUSer, which is probably responsible for decoding AGN codons. This solution seems to be the simplest one among the speculations so far postulated (see Introduction) (1Osawa S. Evolution of the Genetic Code. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1995Google Scholar, 2Osawa S. Jukes T.H. Watanabe K. Muto A. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 229-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,17Watanabe K. Osawa S. Soll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA Structure, Biosynthesis and Function. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 225-250Google Scholar).We thus consider that the occurrence of m7G at the wobble position, which has emerged uniquely in echinoderm mitochondria, leads to non-canonical base pairing. This, together with the results concerning codon-anticodon relationships obtained so far for various animal mitochondria (3Heckman J.E. Sarnoff J. Alzner-DeWeerd B. Yin S. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3159-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 4Martin R.P. Sibler A.P. Gehrke C.W. Kuo K. Edmonds C.G. McCloskey J.A. Dirheimer G.

A. 1980; 77: 3164-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), enables us to draw up a set of general rules for codon-anticodon interaction in mitochondria. These are summarized in Fig. 6.In conventional mitochondrial wobble rules so far elucidated (3Heckman J.E. Sarnoff J. Alzner-DeWeerd B. Yin S. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3159-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 4Martin R.P. Sibler A.P. Gehrke C.W. Kuo K. Edmonds C.G. McCloskey J.A. Dirheimer G.

A. 1980; 77: 3164-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), tRNAs with unmodified guanosine in the first anticodon position are considered to translate only codons terminating in a pyrimidine at the third position, while anticodons with modified uridine at the same position translate codons having a purine at the third position (Fig. 6 a).In Drosophila mitochondria, alignment of mt genes suggests that AGA is a serine codon, whereas AGG is an unassigned codon (2Osawa S. Jukes T.H. Watanabe K. Muto A. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 229-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), because AGG has never appeared in Drosophila mt genomes. We have isolated Drosophila melanogastertRNAGCUSer, which presumably recognize codons AGC, AGU, and AGA (15Okimoto R. Macfarlane J.L. Clary D.O. Wolstenholme D.R. Genetics. 1992; 130: 471-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and found that unmodified guanosine is the wobble nucleotide (unpublished observation). Based on the mt genomic sequence, it is unlikely that any tRNA competing with tRNAGCUSer with regard to the translation of codon AGA exists. Thus, unmodified guanosine is probably able to base pair with adenosine at the codon third position, unless a tRNA that efficiently decodes this codon (a competitor tRNA) does exist simultaneously in the translation system (Fig. 6 b).This hypothesis is supported by the following fact. In starfish mitochondria, AUA is an isoleucine codon, which differs from other known animal mitochondria in which AUA is used as a methionine codon (2Osawa S. Jukes T.H. Watanabe K. Muto A. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 229-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that isoleucine and methionine tRNAs of starfish have unmodified GAU and CAU anticodons, respectively (data not shown). Our observation that the wobble nucleoside of the sole mammalian mt methionine tRNA is 5-formylcytidine led us to propose the possibility that this modification allows decoding of AUA in addition to AUG (5Moriya J. Yokogawa T. Wakita K. Ueda T. Nishikawa K. Crain P.F. Hashizume T. Pomerantz S.C. McCloskey J.A. Kawai G. Hayashi N. Yokoyama S. Watanabe K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2234-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These codon-anticodon relationships for methionine and isoleucine in mammalian and starfish mitochondria support the above interpretation on the decoding properties of unmodified guanosine at the wobble position. Since the unmodified CAU anticodon of methionine tRNA has no capability of decoding AUA (1Osawa S. Evolution of the Genetic Code. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1995Google Scholar, 2Osawa S. Jukes T.H. Watanabe K. Muto A. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 229-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) due to the lack of modification at the wobble position, the tRNAMet does not compete with tRNAIle in translating the AUA codon, so that tRNAIle possessing the GAU anticodon can translate not only AUC and AUU, but also AUA. Thus it can be concluded that guanosine at the wobble position decodes C, U, and A.In ascidian mitochondria, AGR codons are specific for glycine, while AGY codons are translated as serine (11Yokobori S. Ueda T. Watanabe K. J. Mol. Evol. 1993; 36: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The corresponding mt tRNAs were isolated and sequenced; tRNAGCUSer was found to have unmodified G at the wobble position, whereas tRNAGly specific for AGR has cmnm5U at the same position (30Kondo A. Yokobori S. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1996; 35: 279-280Google Scholar). In this case, tRNAGly may compete with tRNAGCUSer, preventing AGR codons from being mistranslated as Ser. In mammalian mitochondria, only AGU and AGC codons are translated by tRNAGCUSerpossessing the anticodon GCU, and there are no tRNAs that translate the AGA and AGG codons (1Osawa S. Evolution of the Genetic Code. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1995Google Scholar, 2Osawa S. Jukes T.H. Watanabe K. Muto A. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 229-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is apparently in contradiction to the above-mentioned codon-anticodon rule, AGG and AGA are utilized as termination codons in mammalian mitochondria (10Anderson S. Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G. de Bruijn M.H.L. Coulson A.R. Drouin J. Eperon I.C. Nierlich D.P. Roe B.A. Sanger F. Schreier P.H. Smith A.J.H. Staden R. Young I.G.

We propose here that a release factor (1Osawa S. Evolution of the Genetic Code. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1995Google Scholar, 2Osawa S. Jukes T.H. Watanabe K. Muto A. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 229-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recognizing these codons plays a role similar to that of the competitor tRNA (Fig. 6 c). Thus, only AGY codons remain for assignment to serine.The present finding that m7G is the wobble nucleotide in starfish mt tRNAGCUSer suggests that methylation of G at N7 expands codon-anticodon interaction to permit base pairing with G, in addition to A, C, and U, at the third position of the codon (Fig. 6 d). Although the influence of the altered charge distribution (resulting form N7 methylation) on the base pairing of m7G with G is unknown, we are now carrying out experiments using an in vitro translation system to confirm the decoding properties of tRNA possessing m7G at the wobble position, and also to verify the ability of m7G to base pair with all four nucleotides with respect to the structural factors. An unusual mode of wobble base interaction with mRNA codons exists in mitochondria (1Osawa S. Evolution of the Genetic Code. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1995Google Scholar, 2Osawa S. Jukes T.H. Watanabe K. Muto A. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 229-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Codons with a pyrimidine in the third position are translated by tRNAs having unmodified guanosine at the first anticodon position. This rule was first proposed for fungal mitochondria (3Heckman J.E.

Jukes T.H. Watanabe K. Muto A. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 229-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,17Watanabe K. Osawa S. Soll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA Structure, Biosynthesis and Function. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 225-250Google Scholar). This truncated D arm could be responsible for G·R pairing, in addition to G·Y pairing, between the anticodon and codons. Another feature is the G·C pair at the bottom of the anticodon stem, which is present in the tRNAGCUSer of mitochondria of invertebrates, but not in those of most vertebrates, in which its place is taken by an A·U pair (2Osawa S. Jukes T.H. Watanabe K. Muto A. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 229-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Watanabe K. Osawa S. Soll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA Structure, Biosynthesis and Function. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 225-250Google Scholar, 18Sprinzl M. Steegborn C. Hübel F. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Since tRNAGCUSer of all metazoan mitochondria except for that of nematode have identical anticodon loops (15Okimoto R. Macfarlane J.L. Clary D.O. Wolstenholme D.R. Genetics. 1992; 130: 471-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there could be some structural differences in regions other than the anticodon loop, depending on which codons, AGY (vertebrates) or AGN (N = A, G, C, or U) (invertebrates), are translated as serine. With the aim of determining which of these speculations is actually the case, the starfish mt tRNAGCUSerresponsible for the noncanonical decoding in the AGN codon box was purified and sequenced, and the modified nucleoside content was determined by electrospray liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (ES-LC/MS). The results showed the first of the speculations posited above to be correct; guanosine at the wobble position of starfish mt tRNAGCUSer has been completely converted to 7-methylguanosine (m7G). This strongly suggests that m7G is capable of base pairing with all four nucleotides, thus resulting in a genetic code change in echinoderm mitochondria. Based on the primary structure of the mt tRNAGCUSer, we also present a scenario that could explain evolutionary changes in the genetic code that have occurred in animal mitochondria. DISCUSSIONWe report here the first known occurrence of m7G at the wobble position of a tRNA. Even since we first discovered that in starfish mitochondria AGN codons seem to be translated as serine by the tRNAGCUSer from the sole corresponding gene located on the mt genome (6Himeno H. Masaki H. Kawai T. Ohta T. Kumagai I. Miura K.-I. Watanabe K. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the question as to how tRNAGCUSer possessing a GCU anticodon decodes all four AGN codons has attracted our interest, especially with regard to the decoding mechanism of mt tRNAs toward nonuniversal codons. This long-pending puzzle has now been solved by the finding that a modified residue (m7G) exists at the wobble position of tRNAGCUSer, which is probably responsible for decoding AGN codons. This solution seems to be the simplest one among the speculations so far postulated (see Introduction) (1Osawa S. Evolution of the Genetic Code. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1995Google Scholar, 2Osawa S. Jukes T.H. Watanabe K. Muto A. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 229-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,17Watanabe K. Osawa S. Soll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA Structure, Biosynthesis and Function. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 225-250Google Scholar).We thus consider that the occurrence of m7G at the wobble position, which has emerged uniquely in echinoderm mitochondria, leads to non-canonical base pairing. This, together with the results concerning codon-anticodon relationships obtained so far for various animal mitochondria (3Heckman J.E. Sarnoff J. Alzner-DeWeerd B. Yin S. RajBhandary U.L. Proc.

These are summarized in Fig. 6.In conventional mitochondrial wobble rules so far elucidated (3Heckman J.E. Sarnoff J. Alzner-DeWeerd B. Yin S. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1980; 77: 3164-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), tRNAs with unmodified guanosine in the first anticodon position are considered to translate only codons terminating in a pyrimidine at the third position, while anticodons with modified uridine at the same position translate codons having a purine at the third position (Fig. 6 a).In Drosophila mitochondria, alignment of mt genes suggests that AGA is a serine codon, whereas AGG is an unassigned codon (2Osawa S. Jukes T.H. Watanabe K. Muto A. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 229-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), because AGG has never appeared in Drosophila mt genomes. We have isolated Drosophila melanogastertRNAGCUSer, which presumably recognize codons AGC, AGU, and AGA (15Okimoto R. Macfarlane J.L. Clary D.O. Wolstenholme D.R. Genetics. 1992; 130: 471-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and found that unmodified guanosine is the wobble nucleotide (unpublished observation). Based on the mt genomic sequence, it is unlikely that any tRNA competing with tRNAGCUSer with regard to the translation of codon AGA exists. Thus, unmodified guanosine is probably able to base pair with adenosine at the codon third position, unless a tRNA that efficiently decodes this codon (a competitor tRNA) does exist simultaneously in the translation system (Fig. 6 b).This hypothesis is supported by the following fact. In starfish mitochondria, AUA is an isoleucine codon, which differs from other known animal mitochondria in which AUA is used as a methionine codon (2Osawa S. Jukes T.H. Watanabe K. Muto A. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 229-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that isoleucine and methionine tRNAs of starfish have unmodified GAU and CAU anticodons, respectively (data not shown). Our observation that the wobble nucleoside of the sole mammalian mt methionine tRNA is 5-formylcytidine led us to propose the possibility that this modification allows decoding of AUA in addition to AUG (5Moriya J. Yokogawa T. Wakita K. Ueda T. Nishikawa K. Crain P.F. Hashizume T. Pomerantz S.C. McCloskey J.A. Kawai G. Hayashi N. Yokoyama S. Watanabe K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2234-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These codon-anticodon relationships for methionine and isoleucine in mammalian and starfish mitochondria support the above interpretation on the decoding properties of unmodified guanosine at the wobble position. Since the unmodified CAU anticodon of methionine tRNA has no capability of decoding AUA (1Osawa S. Evolution of the Genetic Code. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1995Google Scholar, 2Osawa S. Jukes T.H. Watanabe K. Muto A. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 229-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) due to the lack of modification at the wobble position, the tRNAMet does not compete with tRNAIle in translating the AUA codon, so that tRNAIle possessing the GAU anticodon can translate not only AUC and AUU, but also AUA. Thus it can be concluded that guanosine at the wobble position decodes C, U, and A.In ascidian mitochondria, AGR codons are specific for glycine, while AGY codons are translated as serine (11Yokobori S. Ueda T. Watanabe K. J. Mol. Evol. 1993; 36: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The corresponding mt tRNAs were isolated and sequenced; tRNAGCUSer was found to have unmodified G at the wobble position, whereas tRNAGly specific for AGR has cmnm5U at the same position (30Kondo A. Yokobori S. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1996; 35: 279-280Google Scholar). In this case, tRNAGly may compete with tRNAGCUSer, preventing AGR codons from being mistranslated as Ser. In mammalian mitochondria, only AGU and AGC codons are translated by tRNAGCUSerpossessing the anticodon GCU, and there are no tRNAs that translate the AGA and AGG codons (1Osawa S. Evolution of the Genetic Code. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1995Google Scholar, 2Osawa S. Jukes T.H. Watanabe K. Muto A. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 229-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is apparently in contradiction to the above-mentioned codon-anticodon rule, AGG and AGA are utilized as termination codons in mammalian mitochondria (10Anderson S. Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G. de Bruijn M.H.L. Coulson A.R. Drouin J. Eperon I.C. Nierlich D.P. Roe B.A. Sanger F. Schreier P.H. Smith A.J.H. Staden R. Young I.G.

We propose here that a release factor (1Osawa S. Evolution of the Genetic Code. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1995Google Scholar, 2Osawa S. Jukes T.H. Watanabe K. Muto A. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 229-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recognizing these codons plays a role similar to that of the competitor tRNA (Fig. 6 c). Thus, only AGY codons remain for assignment to serine.The present finding that m7G is the wobble nucleotide in starfish mt tRNAGCUSer suggests that methylation of G at N7 expands codon-anticodon interaction to permit base pairing with G, in addition to A, C, and U, at the third position of the codon (Fig. 6 d). Although the influence of the altered charge distribution (resulting form N7 methylation) on the base pairing of m7G with G is unknown, we are now carrying out experiments using an in vitro translation system to confirm the decoding properties of tRNA possessing m7G at the wobble position, and also to verify the ability of m7G to base pair with all four nucleotides with respect to the structural factors. We report here the first known occurrence of m7G at the wobble position of a tRNA.

Chem. 1995; 270: 20543-20549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); these CPA2 isoforms are shorter and have a distinct role from the pancreatic isoform. The high sequence identity found between human pro-CPA2 and rat pro-CPA2 (89% homology) as compared with human pro-CPA1 (64% homology) corroborates the proposal that locates the appearance of the two isoforms by gene duplication before speciation of mammals (11Gardell S.J.

Comparison of the prodomain structures in the family of pancreatic proenzymes shows close similarities in conformation between the A1 and A2 forms in regions assumed to be critical for their inhibition and proteolytic activation (6Guasch A. Coll M. Avilés F.X. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 14Catasús L. Vendrell J. Avilés F.X. Carreira S. Puigserver A. Billeter M. J. Biol.

Huber R. EMBO J. 1991; 9: 1-9Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the A2 proenzyme could be expected to show a bimodal and slow proteolytic activation behavior, as previously reported for the A1 form (16Vendrell J. Cuchillo C.M. Avilés F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6949-6953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and to differ from the monotonic and quick activation behavior found for the B proenzyme (17Villegas V. Vendrell J. Avilés F.X. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1792-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, earlier proteolytic activation experiments carried out on natural pro-CPA2 isolated from human or rat pancreas (12Pascual R. Burgos F.J. Salvà M. Soriano F. Méndez E. Avilés F.X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Oppezzo O. Ventura S. Bergman T. Vendrell J. Jörnvall H. Avilés F.X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) do not fit with these expectations and assumptions. Therefore, this is an issue that requires clarification. In this work, pro-CPA2 has been overexpressed inPichia pastoris to produce the protein in quantities amenable to the study of the structural and functional determinants of its behavior and activation. The methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris was chosen because of its high yield and capacity of secreting heterologous proteins when linked to the appropriate secretion signal (19Cregg J.M. Vedvick T.S. Raschke W.C. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). The development of the system reported here to obtain large quantities of fully activable human pro-CPA2should facilitate not only the characterization of this form, but probably also that of other structurally related forms to which the same procedure could be applied. It could also facilitate its potential biotechnological use, such as the large-scale production of carboxypeptidases able to act as activators of antitumoral prodrugs (20Huennekens F.M. Trends Biotechnol. 1994; 12: 234-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Laethem R.M. Blumenkopf T.A. Cory M. Elwell L. Moxham C.P. Ray P.H. Walton L.M. Smith G.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The efficient expression of human pro-CPA2 inP. pastoris has allowed us to investigate the different events in the proteolytic activation and processing of this proenzyme in detail and to compare them with the processes described in other pancreatic procarboxypeptidases. An overall maturation scheme of such zymogens emerges from this study. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, Vent polymerase, deoxynucleotide stocks, and N-glycosidase F were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Salts and media for Escherichia coli and P. pastoris growth were purchased from Difco. The P. pastoris expression kit was purchased from Invitrogen. Trypsin (treated with tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone) was from Worthington. Trifluoroacetic acid, N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), and N-(3-(2-furyl)acryloyl)-l-phenylalanyl-l-phenylalanine (FAPP) were from Sigma. Electrophoretic studies were carried out in a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean system. HPLC studies were carried out in a Waters chromatograph. DNA manipulations were carried out essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) usingE. coli strains JM83 and MC1061 as hosts. The cDNA of human pro-CPA2 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a pUC9 vector to introduce an XhoI site at the 5′-end and an EcoRI site at the 3′-end of the cDNA using the following primers: sense primer, 5′-GTATCTCTCGAGAAAAGACTAGAAACATTTGTGGGAGA-3′; and antisense primer, 5′-CTAGAATTCATGGCTCTTGTTTCTTCC-3′. After restriction enzyme digestion of the polymerase chain reaction product, the cDNA was cloned and subcloned into M13 pBluescript to confirm the entire sequence and the changes made in the polymerase chain reaction. pBluescript-pro-CPA2 was digested byXhoI and EcoRI, and the cDNA was ligated to the P. pastoris shuttle vector pPIC9 between the 5′-promoter and the 3′-terminator of the alcohol oxidase gene (AOX1). pPIC9 provides the α-mating factor signal for secretion and theHIS4 gene for selection of the recombinant yeast clones. pHIL-D2 was also used for the expression and secretion of pro-CPA2 using its own signal sequence. In the latter case, the original pUC9-pro-CPA2 clone was digested and ligated to the P. pastoris pHIL-D2 shuttle vector using theEcoRI site of the polylinker. After linearization of the corresponding P. pastorispPIC9-pro-CPA2 and pHIL-D2-prepro-CPA2 vectors with BglII and NotI, respectively, the P. pastoris GS115 (his4) strain was transformed either by electroporation or by the spheroplast method. After simultaneously plating the transformants in MM and MD agar (1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 0.00004% biotin, and 0.5% methanol or 1% dextrose, respectively), those clones that suffered homologous recombination with the AOX1 sequence (slow growing in MM agar) were selected. To test for the most productive clones, colonies were grown in 10 ml of buffered liquid BMGY medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 90 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 0.00004% biotin, and 1% glycerol) at 30 °C for 4 days. Cells were collected by centrifugation and gently resuspended in 2 ml of buffered liquid BMMY medium (same as BMGY medium but containing 0.5% methanol instead of 1% glycerol) and cultured for another 2 days to induce the expression of the recombinant protein. The production of the clones was monitored after 6, 24, and 48 h by electrophoretic analysis of the supernatant on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels. Western blotting was carried out as described previously using 1:500 anti-human pancreatic procarboxypeptidase antiserum (14Catasús L. Vendrell J. Avilés F.X. Carreira S. Puigserver A. Billeter M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6651-6657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The functionality of the expressed protein was analyzed with the synthetic substrate FAPP after activation of the proenzyme with trypsin (at a 40:1 ratio by weight). 1-Liter shake-flask cultures were grown at 30 °C for 4 days in buffered BMGY medium (20–30 A units at 600 nm; 20 g of cells (dry weight)/liter). Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1500 g, gently resuspended in 200 ml of BMMY medium, and cultured for another 2 days to induce the production of pro-CPA2. The culture medium was separated from the cells by centrifugation, and after equilibrating its ionic strength, it was processed through a two-step chromatographic purification: hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a butyl-Toyopearl 650M column eluted with a decreasing gradient of ammonium sulfate and fast protein liquid chromatography on a preparative anion-exchange column (TSK-DEAE 5PW) eluted with a gradient of ammonium acetate in 30 mmMES, pH 5.7. The elution of recombinant pro-CPA2 was observed at 9% ammonium sulfate and 6 mm ammonium acetate, respectively. The identity of recombinant pro-CPA2 was confirmed after automated Edman degradation analysis of its N-terminal sequence and MALDI-TOF spectrometry analysis. Recombinant human pro-CPA2 at 1 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl and 1 μmZnCl2, pH 8.0, was treated with trypsin at 40:1 and 400:1 (w/w) ratios at 0 °C. At given times after trypsin addition, aliquots were removed for activity measurements, for electrophoretic reverse-phase HPLC and mass spectrometry analyses, and for quantification of the released amino acids. For activity measurements, 10 μl of the activation mixture were added to 190 μl of aprotinin (bovine pancreas trypsin inhibitor) at 0.1 mg/ml in 20 mmTris and 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.5, and 10 μl of this new mixture were used to carry out spectrophotometric activity measurements with the FAPP substrate at 330 nm. For electrophoretic analysis, 20 μl of the activation mixture were mixed with 2 μl of 22 mm TLCK in water to reach a final trypsin inhibitor concentration of 2 mm. Each sample was immediately mixed with electrophoretic loading buffer containing 1% SDS and 3% β-mercaptoethanol, heated at 90 °C for 1 min, and stored at −20 °C until analysis. Electrophoresis was carried out on Tricine-polyacrylamide gels (23Schägger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). For HPLC and mass spectrometry analyses, 90-μl samples were removed from the activation mixture, made 0.5% in trifluoroacetic acid to inhibit proteolysis, and immediately chromatographed or kept at −20 °C for subsequent analysis. For quantitation of the amino acids released into the activation mixture, 90-μl samples were taken (2 nmol of initial pro-CPA2) and mixed with trifluoroacetic acid up to a final concentration of 0.5%. 1.5 nmol of norleucine were added as a quantitative reference before the addition of 3 volumes of ethanol to precipitate proteins and large peptides. The supernatant was lyophilized and analyzed for amino acid composition. Samples removed from the activation mixtures were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC on Vydac C4 supports. A 214TP54 column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5-μm particle size, 0.3 μm-pore) was used, and elution was followed at 214 nm. Chromatographies were performed in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with an eluting linear gradient between water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) according to the following steps: 10% solvent B from 0 to 10 min, 10–32% solvent B from 10 to 30 min, and 32–52% solvent B from 30 to 130 min. The activation mixtures were analyzed by mass spectrometry with a MALDI-TOF spectrometer (Biflex with Reflectron, Bruker). 50 pmol of each sample in 1 μl were mixed with 1 μl of 50% synapinic acid as a matrix and loaded. Amino acid analyses were carried out by the 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4′-sulfonyl derivatization method (24Vendrell J. Avilés F.X. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 358: 401-413Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) using materials and protocols from Beckman. A reverse-phase HPLC NovaPak C18 column was used to separate the amino acids and oligopeptides produced during the activation. After analysis by SDS-PAGE or analysis and purification by HPLC, N-terminal sequence analysis of pro-CPA2 and the activation products was performed by blotting the samples on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, followed by direct analysis on a Beckman LF3000 Protein Sequencer. A 1254-base pair cDNA encoding human preprocarboxypeptidase A2 has been cloned from a pancreatic library by immunological and radioactive approaches (14Catasús L. Vendrell J. Avilés F.X. Carreira S. Puigserver A. Billeter M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6651-6657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This cDNA codes for a short leader signal peptide of 16 amino acids, a pro-segment of 96 amino acids, and an active enzyme of 305 amino acids (see below). In this work, this cDNA was modified by polymerase chain reaction to add an XhoI site at the 5′-end and an EcoRI site at the 3′-end to amplify only the proenzyme. The complete human prepro-CPA2 cDNA was also cloned into theEcoRI site of the P. pastoris pHIL-D2 expression vector to test whether the native signal sequence of pro-CPA2 could release the proenzyme into the extracellular medium. Transformation of the P. pastoris GS115 (his4) strain with the linearized vectors was carried out by the spheroplast and electroporation methods. Both gave a similar number of transformants, which were screened for histidinol dehydrogenase (His+) phototrophy by plating on a dextrose-based medium without histidine supplementation. Nearly 20% of the His+clones from the transformation showed reduced growth on methanol as the sole carbon source (slow growing, Mut−), indicating the integration of the expression cassette into the AOX1gene. The clones transformed with the α-MF-pro-CPA2 fusion product secreted a dominant 45-kDa protein in the P. pastoris supernatant upon induction by methanol. Those transformed with pHIL-D2-prepro-CPA2 did not secrete any protein into the medium. The 45-kDa protein was found to correspond to human pro-CPA2 by Western blot analysis. Upon induction with 0.5% methanol, the Mut− phenotypes expressed more protein than the Mut+ phenotypes. However, a 3-fold increase in protein secretion was observed in the Mut+ phenotypes when induction was assayed with 5% methanol (data not shown). One of these high productivity clones was selected for large-scale production of human pro-CPA2. Analysis of the production of human pro-CPA2 in the above system by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting is shown in Fig. 1. After 2 days of induction by methanol, a strong band of the proenzyme and a faint band corresponding to the 34-kDa active form were detected in the intracellular soluble part of the culture. This observation is in accordance with previous reports about the existence of proteases with trypsin-like activity in P. pastoris (25Ohi H. Ohtani W. Okazaki N. Furuhata N. Ohmura T. Yeast. 1996; 12: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). After 30 h of methanol induction, in addition to the dominant 45-kDa pro-CPA2 protein, a smear of high relative molecular mass, immunodetected by human procarboxypeptidase antiserum, was visible (Fig. 1 B) in the lanes corresponding to the extracellular medium. It corresponds to the α-MF-pro-CPA2 fusion product, which containsN-linked glycosylations in the signal peptide (26Kjeldsen T. Brandt J. Andersen A.S. Egel-Mitani M. Hach M. Petterson A.F. Vad K. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 170: 97-112Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and is not cleaved by the P. pastoris KEX2 processing protease. After purification (see below) and treatment of the sample withN-glycosidase F, conversion of the smear into a lower molecular mass band that corresponds to the α-MF-pro-CPA2fusion product was observed (Fig. 2). The different protein products was finally identified by N-terminal sequencing of the blotted SDS-polyacrylamide bands (data not shown). Trypsin treatment gave rise in all cases to a CPA2 (Fig. 2) and to activation peptides (not shown in the figure) with the expected molecular masses, i.e. 34 and 10–11 kDa, respectively.Figure 2Deglycosylation and activation with trypsin of the α-MF-pro-CPA2 fusion protein. SDS-8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to analyze the different products containing pro-CPA2 purified from the P. pastoris culture. Samples were analyzed before (lanes 1, 3, and 5) and after (lanes 2, 4, and 6) trypsin treatment. Lanes 1 and 2, correctly processed recombinant human pro-CPA2; lanes 3 and 4, samples containing a glycosylated derivative of the α-MF-pro-CPA2fusion product; lanes 5 and 6, the α-MF-pro-CPA2 fusion product after deglycosylation. 2 μg of CPA2 purified from correctly processed recombinant pro-CPA2 were loaded in lane 7 as a control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As reported above, the human pro-CPA2 gene was cloned behind the α-MF peptide to accomplish secretion of the recombinant protein. N-terminal sequence analysis of secreted recombinant human pro-CPA2 showed the occurrence of heterogeneity in the processing of the α-MF precursor. The deduced processing targets, located at the boundary between the α-MF precursor and pro-CPA2, are indicated in Fig. 3. Native pro-CPA2 was the major form found in all cultures, but different unspecific cleavage targets for endopeptidases were found in every induction performed on the same clone. Since the system used has been pushed to overexpress the recombinant protein at >300 mg/liter, the processing machinery might be unable to properly process all the material. A chromatographic approach was developed to separate the differently processed forms of human recombinant pro-CPA2 and to isolate the native form. It was based upon a two-step purification scheme, with atmospheric hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a butyl column applied first, followed by fast protein liquid anion-exchange chromatography to separate the different forms (see “Experimental Procedures”). Starting from a cell culture of a Mut+ clone that achieved a cell density of 20 g of cells (dry weight)/liter, an overall yield of 250 mg of total pure pro-CPA2 was normally obtained. The correctly processed pro-CPA2 form was generally the principal one, with yields varying from 80 to 200 mg/liter, although in certain cultures, the glycosylated and incorrectly processed forms could account for as much as 60% of the purified material. In contrast, treatment of total pro-CPA2 with trypsin before the anion-exchange chromatography yielded ∼180 mg of homogeneous, correctly processed CPA2/liter of cell culture. Both the purified recombinant pro-CPA2 and CPA2 forms were fully functional, with enzymatic properties similar to those previously reported for the natural forms isolated from human pancreas (12Pascual R. Burgos F.J. Salvà M. Soriano F. Méndez E. Avilés F.X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recombinant CPA2 and the enzyme isolated from pancreas showed the same maximum specific activity of ∼85 μmol of FAPP substrate hydrolyzed per min/mg of protein. Analysis of the action of trypsin, chymotrypsin A, and elastase (the major active endoproteolytic counterparts in pancreatic secretion) upon correctly processed recombinant pro-CPA2indicates that trypsin is, by far, the most efficient activator (data not shown). At the pro-CPA2/endoprotease ratio used, 90% activation of the former was achieved by trypsin in ∼10 min, whereas the same level of activation was only achieved after 125 min of treatment with elastase; in the latter time span, chymotrypsin was able to generate only 10% of active CPA2. This is in agreement with previous studies that reported trypsin as the main enzyme responsible for the activation of pancreatic procarboxypeptidases (3Auld D.S. Vallee B.L. New Compr. Biochem. 1987; 16: 201-256Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The action of trypsin at 37 °C on recombinant pro-CPA2 at a 40:1 (w/w) pro-CPA2/trypsin ratio is excessively quick for detailed mechanistic analysis, in agreement with previous studies on natural human proenzymes (12Pascual R. Burgos F.J. Salvà M. Soriano F. Méndez E. Avilés F.X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The study of the activation process was therefore carried out at 0 °C and at a 400:1 ratio. Under these conditions, the appearance of carboxypeptidase activity was measured with the synthetic substrate FAPP; it followed a quick and monotonic activation curve, which can be fitted to a pseudo first-order kinetics (Fig. 4 A). Using Tricine/SDS-PAGE, the rapid proteolytic severing of the pro-segment, the concomitant appearance of CPA2, and a straight correlation of this proteolysis with the monotonic activity curve were observed (Fig. 4 B). Nearly all pro-CPA2 was converted into its active form in 20 min, and a maximum value in the activity curve was achieved. The generated pro-segment appeared as a single band on Tricine/SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 B), although mass spectrometry analysis indicated heterogeneity for this species (see below). The N-terminal sequence of the electrophoretic CPA2 band, obtained from different samples at different activation times and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, was always Ser-Gly-Asn-, a fact that indicates that the Arg96–Ser97 peptide bond is the first point of cleavage of the proenzyme by trypsin. From this result and from the increase in the intensity of the CPA2 band in parallel with the appearance of CPA2 activity in the medium and the corresponding decrease in the intensity of the pro-CPA2band (Fig. 4 B), it can be assumed that the cleavage of the Arg96–Ser97 peptide bond is sufficient to generate all the carboxypeptidase activity. As a consequence, it can be concluded that the severed pro-segment does not inhibit CPA2, in contrast to what has been previously reported for the pro-CPA1 forms (12Pascual R. Burgos F.J. Salvà M. Soriano F. Méndez E. Avilés F.X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Vendrell J. Cuchillo C.M. Avilés F.X. J. Biol.

To study the maturation process in more detail, the time course of degradation of the pro-segment was followed by reverse-phase HPLC. It was expected that this degradation would take place only at the C-terminal arginine-rich end of the pro-segment since N-terminal sequence analyses of the activation mixtures indicated the appearance of only two N termini throughout the process, one corresponding to the original proenzyme and one from the generate"
https://openalex.org/W2074798108,"In baby hamster kidney and other cultured cells the majority of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is synthesized from phosphatidylserine (PS) in a process which involves transport of PS from the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria and decarboxylation therein by PS decarboxylase. To study the mechanism of this transport process, we first determined the molecular species composition of PE and PS from baby hamster kidney and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Interestingly, the hydrophilic diacyl molecular species were found to be much more abundant in PE than in PS, suggesting that hydrophilic PS species may be more readily transported to mitochondria than the hydrophobic ones. To study this, we compared the rates of decarboxylation of different PS molecular species in these cells. The cells were pulse labeled with [3H]serine whereafter the distribution of the labels among PS and PE molecular species was determined by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and liquid scintillation counting. The hydrophilic PE species contained relatively much more 3H label than those of PS, which indicates that they are more readily decarboxylated than the hydrophobic ones. Control experiments showed that differences in [3H]PS and -PE molecular species profiles are not due to (i) incorporation of 3H label to some PE species via alternative pathways, (ii) differences in degradation or remodeling among species, or (iii) selective decarboxylation of PS molecular species by the enzyme. Therefore, hydrophilic PS species are indeed decarboxylated faster than the hydrophobic ones. The rate of decarboxylation decreased systematically with hydrophobicity, strongly suggesting that formation of so called activated monomers, i.e. lipid molecules perpendicularly displaced from the membrane (Jones, J. D., and Thompson, T. E. (1990)Biochemistry 29, 1593–1600), is the rate-limiting step in the transport of PS from the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria. The formation of activated monomers and thus the rate of transfer is probably greatly enhanced by frequent collisions between the two membranes which tend to be closely associated. The present data also provides a feasible explanation why hydrophilic molecular species in these cells are much more abundant in PE as compared with PS, its immediate precursor.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11190-11198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Based on these facts, it has been suggested that the transport occurs upon collision of the ER and mitochondrial membranes (8Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9921-9925Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Supporting this, it has been shown that fragments of ER-related membrane (MAM, mitochondria-associated membrane) enriched in PS synthase and other enzymes of lipid biosynthesis cosediment with mitochondria from hepatocytes (13Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CHO cells (12Shiao Y.-J. Lupo G. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11190-11198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae (14Zinser E. Sperka-Gottlieb C.D.M. Fasch E.-V. Kohlwein S.D. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2026-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The close association of MAM with mitochondria is expected to increase the probability of productive collisions. To further elucidate the mechanism of PS transfer from ER to mitochondria, we have here compared the rates of decarboxylation of newly synthesized PS molecular species in cultured cells. Intriguingly, the results show that the hydrophilic PS species are decarboxylated much faster than the more hydrophobic ones. Since the rate of PS translocation to mitochondria, rather than decarboxylation itself, is rate-limiting (15Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8019-8025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this finding strongly suggests that the hydrophilic PS species are preferentially transported to mitochondria. This, in turn, indicates that the rate-limiting step in the overall transfer process is the desorption of the PS molecule from the ER membrane. Such a mechanism would be in accordance with the previously proposed collision-based model and would explain why the diacyl-PE molecular species in these cells are, on the average, much more hydrophilic than the PS species. The unlabeled phospholipids were supplied by Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL) and β-chloro-l-alanine, l-cycloserine, and phospholipase C (type XI from Bacillus cereus, EC3.1.4.3) by Sigma. The solvents were of reagent or HPLC grade and were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), as were the TLC plates.l-[3-3H]Serine (27 Ci/mmol) was provided by Amersham International (Amersham, United Kingdom). BHK-21 cells were cultured on plastic tissue culture dishes or flasks (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (41965–039) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (200 units/ml), and streptomycin (200 μg/ml) under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. CHO-K1 cells were cultured similarly except that minimal essential α-medium (22561-021) was used instead. All cell culture media and supplements were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (United Kingdom). Confluent monolayers of BHK or CHO cells were incubated in a serum-free medium for 12 h, washed twice with PBS, and then labeled for 15 min at 37 °C in serine-free minimal essential medium (21090-022) containing 15 μCi of [3H]serine. In some experiments, β-chloroalanine (1 mm), an inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase (16Medlock K.A. Merrill Jr., A.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7079-7084Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) was added to the medium 2 h prior to the pulse. After the pulse, the cells were washed twice with PBS and chased at 37 °C in serum-free medium containing serine (1 mm) and ethanolamine (1 mm) for up to 22 h. They were then washed twice with PBS, scraped into PBS, pelleted by low-speed centrifugation and, after addition of bovine brain PS carrier (50 nmol/dish), the lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (17Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41840) Google Scholar). The lipid extract was subjected to TLC using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (25:15:4:1) as solvent. The bands corresponding to PS and PE were scraped off and the lipids were eluted from silica with chloroform, methanol, 0.2 m acetic acid (1:1:0.2). To analyze the 3H labeling of PS and PE molecular species, these lipids were converted to trinitrophenyl (TNP)-derivatives essentially as described previously (18Hullin F. Kim H.-Y. Salem Jr., N. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1963-1975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yield of TNP-PE and TNP-PS was 95 ± 5 and 91 ± 9%, respectively. Control experiments with standards showed that there was, as expected, no differences in the degree of derivatization of individual PE or PS molecular species. The TNP-derivatives were purified by TLC using chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (10:4:2:2:0.5) as solvent and extracted from silica as above. TNP-PS and TNP-PE molecular species were then separated on an Ultrasphere 4.6 × 250-mm ODS (5 μm) column (Beckman Inc., CA) using 30 mm choline chloride in methanol, 25 mm KH2PO4, acetonitrile, acetic acid (906:62:25:8, v/v) (19Patton G.M. Fasulo J.M. Robins S.J. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 190-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as solvent. Fractions were collected and their radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The identity of the cellular PS and PE molecular species was determined by comparing their relative retention times with TNP-PE and -PS standards prepared from phosphatidylcholine species by phospholipase D-mediated transphosphatidylation (20Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Zwaal R.F.A. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1719-1721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the following phosphatidylcholine species: 12:0/12:0, 14:0/14:0, 15:0/15:0, 16:0/16:0, 16:0/18:1, 16:0/18:2, 16:0/18:3, 16:0/20:4, 16:0/22:6, 17:0/17:0, 18:0/18:1, 18:0/ 18:3, 18:0/20:4, 18:0/22:6, 18:1/18:1, and 18:2/18:2. The identification was confirmed using various other methods (see below). [3H]PS (approximately 450 nmol) was blown to dryness, 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1.5 mm Triton X-100 and 1 mm EDTA was added and the mixture was sonicated for 4 min on a bath sonicator to assure the complete dispersion of the lipid. After addition of crude rat liver PSD (0.9 mg) solubilized (21Dygas A. Zborowski J. Acta Biochim. Polon. 1989; 36: 131-141PubMed Google Scholar) in the same buffer, the reaction mixture was incubated in a shaking water bath at 37 °C and aliquots were removed and mixed with chloroform/methanol (1:2) at 5, 10, 15, and 20 min of incubation. Lipids were then extracted and [3H]PS and [3H]PE were separated with TLC as described above, except that the TLC plate was first developed with acetone to removeβ-mercaptoethanol (originating from the enzyme preparation) which interferes with the subsequent derivatization step. Four different methods were used to determine the molecular species composition of cellular PS and PE. First, PS and PE were converted to TNP-derivatives and the molecular species separated by reverse phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) as above and quantitated based on absorbance at 340 nm (18Hullin F. Kim H.-Y. Salem Jr., N. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1963-1975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, PE was hydrolyzed to diglycerides by incubation with phospholipase C and the diglycerides formed were converted to benzoyl derivatives. These were separated into diacyl, alkenyl-acyl, and alkyl-acyl subclasses, each of which was then fractionated into molecular species on a RP-HPLC column. All these steps were carried out essentially as detailed in Ref. 22Patton G.M. Robins S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 195-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar. Third, the isolated PS and PE classes were subjected to electrospray mass spectroscopic analysis on a Micromass Quattro II tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Altrincham, UK). This method allows both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the individual species (23Han X. Gross R.W. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 6: 1202-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Fourth, gas chromatography analysis (24Christie W.C. Gas Chromatography and Lipids. A Practical Guide. The Oily Press, Ayr, Scotland1989Google Scholar) of the fatty acid methyl esters of the total PE and PS fractions was performed. Fig. 1 shows the reverse phase HPLC separation of PS and PE molecular species from BHK cells as TNP-derivatives. The identity of the species eluting in different peaks are given in Table I. Obviously, the distribution of mass among PS species is very different from that of PE. In PS (Fig. 1 , top panel) the major species are: 18:0/18:1 (peak 15), 18:1/18:1 (peak 8), and 16:0/18:1 + 16:1/18:0 (peak 7) which constitute about 43, 20, and 17% of all PS species, respectively. Notably, there are only minor amounts of the more rapidly eluting species (peaks 1–6). In PE (Fig. 1 , middle panel) those rapidly eluting species are relatively much more abundant than in PS, while the reverse is true for the slowly eluting ones. (Note that below we will refer to the rapidly eluting species as “hydrophilic” and to the slowly eluting species as “hydrophobic” for convenience. See below for justification of this correlation.)Table IPS and PE molecular species in BHK cellsPeakDiacyl speciesAlkenyl-acyl species1-aAlkenyl-acyl species are present only in PE, where they constitute approximately 40%. PE also contains about 5% alkyl-acyl species (not shown) each of which is a very minor one.116:0 /22:6216:0 /20:4318:1 /20:4416:0 /18:216:1 /18:1518:1 /18:216:0 /22:6616:0 /22:5 {n-3)16:0 /20:416:0 /22:5 {n-6)16:0 /20:3716:0 /18:116:1 /18:018:0 /22:61-bNot detected in PS.818:1 /18:118:0 /20:41-bNot detected in PS.918:0 /18:210ND1-cND, not determined.1118:0 /22:5 {n-3)16:0 /18:118:0 /22:61218:0 /22:5 {n-6)18:1 /18:118:0 /20:41318:0 /20:31416:0 /18:01518:0 /18:11-a Alkenyl-acyl species are present only in PE, where they constitute approximately 40%. PE also contains about 5% alkyl-acyl species (not shown) each of which is a very minor one.1-b Not detected in PS.1-c ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab To study to which extent these differences derive from the fact that PE from BHK cells contains significant amounts of plasmalogens, TNP-PE was subjected to acid treatment to cleave the plasmalogens. As shown in Fig. 1 , bottom panel, the profile is, as expected, somewhat different from that of untreated TNP-PE, but the prevalence of the hydrophilic species, as compared with PS (Fig. 1 , top panel), is essentially retained. Analogous results were obtained with CHO cells (data not shown). The identity and relative abundance of PS and PE molecular species were confirmed by electrospray mass spectroscopy (23Han X. Gross R.W. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 6: 1202-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and in the case of PE, also by RP-HPLC analysis of diacyl, alkenyl-acyl, and alkyl-acyl classes as benzoyl diglycerides (see “Experimental Procedures”). Since in BHK and CHO cells most, or even all of PE is derived from PS by decarboxylation (2Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2669-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 3Miller M.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9753-9761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is striking that the molecular species profiles of PS, the precursor, is so different from that of the product, i.e. PE. This, intriguingly, suggest that the hydrophilic PS species may be decarboxylated more rapidly than the hydrophobic ones in these cells. To investigate whether the hydrophilic PS species are preferentially decarboxylated in BHK cells, as implicated by the compositional data above, confluent monolayers were labeled with [3H]serine for 15 min and then chased up to 22 h. The chase medium contained, in addition to cold serine, also ethanolamine to inhibit incorporation of radiolabeled ethanolamine possibly released from [3H]PE to other PE pools via the base exchange or the CDP-ethanolamine pathway (25Samborski R.W. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Confluent monolayers were used to minimize recycling of the [3H]ethanolamine moiety among PE species (26Shiao Y.-J. Vance J.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). After the incubation, PS and PE were isolated by TLC, converted to TNP-derivatives and separated into molecular species as outlined above. Fig. 2 , top panel, shows the distribution of 3H radioactivity among PS molecular species immediately after the pulse. The most notable feature is that the more hydrophobic species contain most of the label and thus the distribution of radioactivity is similar to the distribution of mass (Fig. 1 , top panel). The distribution did not change significantly during a 7.5-h chase (Fig. 2 , second panel from the top) suggesting that all species have similar turnover times. However, the amount of label in the more hydrophilic species (peaks 1–9) appears to be somewhat reduced as compared with the hydrophobic 18:0/18:1 species (peak 15). Fig. 2 , third panel from the top, shows the distribution of the 3H label among PE species immediately after the pulse. The radioactivity profile is quite similar to the distribution of mass among cellular diacyl PE species (Fig. 1 , middle panel) and is therefore very different from that observed for PS (Fig. 2 , top panel). The rapidly eluting (hydrophilic) PE species contain relatively much more label than in the case of PS. The distribution of the label among PE species changed somewhat after 7.5 h of chase (Fig. 2 , bottom panel). First, it is apparent that the hydrophilic species (1Zborowski J. Dygas A. Wojtczak L. FEBS Lett. 1983; 157: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 2Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2669-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 3Miller M.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9753-9761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kuge O. Nishijima M.

J. 1993; 293: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) now contain relatively more label than at the end of the pulse. Second, some species (marked with theasterisk) had lost most of the label at this time, indicating that they turn over much more rapidly than the others. However, these latter species are not labeled via decarboxylation of [3H]PS but via an alternative pathway (see below). Analogous results were obtained with CHO cells (data not shown). Based on these findings, it would be tempting to conclude that hydrophilic PS species are preferentially decarboxylated in these cells. However, several alternative explanations have to be excluded before such a conclusion may eventually be drawn. It is known that [3H]serine radioactivity can incorporate to PE also via an alternative pathway that involves (i) incorporation of serine to sphingosine (ii), cleavage of sphingosine to phosphoethanolamine, (iii) formation of CDP-ethanolamine, and (iv) reaction of the CDP-ethanolamine with diglyceride to form PE (27Hanada K. Nishijima M. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Fujita S. Ogawa T. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23527-23533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To asses the contribution of this pathway to labeling of PE species, the pulse-chase experiment was repeated in the presence of β-chloroalanine, an inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase (16Medlock K.A. Merrill Jr., A.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7079-7084Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Chen H. Born E. Mathur S.N. Field F.J. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 2159-2167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TLC analysis showed that the fraction of 3H label in sphingomyelin, which was 16–19% of total lipid radioactivity in control cells, decreased to zero in the presence of β-chloroalanine. This compound thus effectively blocks the metabolism of [3H]serine via the sphingosine-phosphoethanolamine pathway in BHK cells. Fig. 3, top panel, shows the distribution of 3H radioactivity among PE species in β-chloroalanine-treated and control cells. The amount of radioactivity in peaks 12 and 13 (marked with the asterisk) is markedly decreased in β-chloroalanine-treated cells. Interestingly, the label in peaks 12 and 13 also exhibited fast turnover in the pulse-chase experiment described above (Fig. 2). As expected, β-chloroalanine had no effect on the distribution of3H label in PS (Fig. 3, bottom panel). Analogous results were obtained with cycloserine, another inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase (data not shown). These data show that some PE species are labeled significantly via the sphingosine-phosphoethanolamine pathway and should thus be excluded when comparing the rates of decarboxylation of different PS molecular species in BHK cells. In cells, serine can rapidly metabolize to compounds like acetate, formate, and glycine (29Xu Z. Byers D.M. Palmer F.B.S.C. Spence M.W. Cook H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2143-2150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which can result in incorporation of significant amounts [3H]serine-derived label to the glycerol and fatty acid moieties of PE and less so, of PS (30Vance J.E. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4486-4491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such labeling, if not properly taken into account, could lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the relative rates of decarboxylation of different species. Accordingly, PS and PE were isolated from cells labeled with [3H]serine for 15 min and chased for 1 or 7 h. The total [3H]PE and [3H]PS fractions were isolated as above and subjected to phospholipase C hydrolysis and subsequent partitioning according to Bligh and Dyer (17Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41840) Google Scholar). In the case of PS, 5.4 ± 0.5% of the radioactivity was found in the lower chloroform phase. This shows, in accordance with previous data (2Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2669-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), that an insignificant amount of the3H label is incorporated to the diglyceride moiety of PS. In contrast, 20.3 ± 2.3% of the 3H label in PE was found in the lower phase, thus demonstrating a significant labeling of the diglyceride moiety. To determine how the diglyceride label distributes between the [3H]PE species, the [3H]diglycerides derived from PE were converted to benzoyl derivatives and separated into molecular species by RP-HPLC. As shown in Fig. 4, a major part of the label was restricted to three diacyl diglyceride peaks. Based on comparison with authentic benzoyl diglyceride standards, these peaks were found to correspond to peaks 1–4, 7, and 8, respectively, in Fig. 1, second panel from the top. These three diglyceride peaks contained 19, 13, and 17% of the total [3H]diglyceride label, respectively. Based on these figures and the fact that 20% of the total [3H]PE radioactivity was in the diglyceride moiety, it was calculated that approximately 15, 17, and 11% of the total radioactivity in peaks 1–4, 7, and 8, respectively, is not derived from [3H]PS. However, even when these figures are taken into account, the earlier suggestion that hydrophilic PE species are decarboxylated much more rapidly than the hydrophobic ones in BHK cells, remains valid. In theory, the distinct 3H profiles obtained for PS and PE (Fig. 2) could result from disparate degradation or remodeling rates of different PS and/or PE species, rather than from different rates of decarboxylation. To study this, the distribution of the 3H label among PS and PE molecular species was determined at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 7, and 22 h after the pulse. As shown in Fig. 5, top panel, there is a loss of radioactivity from all PS peaks during the chase. Interestingly, however, the loss appears to be more rapid from the peaks (1–6 in particular) containing the more hydrophilic species. Correspondingly, the hydrophilic PE species appear to be labeled more rapidly than the hydrophobic ones. Peaks 12 and 13 deviate from this general pattern, but this can be fully accounted by the fact that most of the label in these peaks is not derived via decarboxylation of [3H]PS but via another pathway (see above). When the radioactivity in the corresponding PS and PE species are summed (Fig. 5, bottom panel), the total 3H radioactivity is found to be essentially constant over the 22-h chase for all species, except for the sphingosine-derived species 12 and 13. The stability of the 3H label in PS + PE is in accordance with previous studies with BHK and CHO cells (2Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2669-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 3Miller M.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9753-9761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Shiao Y.-J. Lupo G. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11190-11198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest that the marked differences in the 3H labeling profiles of PS and PE molecular species (Fig. 2) are not due to differences in remodeling/degradation rates of PS or PE species, but indeed reflect a more rapid decarboxylation of the hydrophilic PS species. Note that the distribution of 3H radioactivity in Fig. 5, bottom panel, indicates the relative proportions of different PS molecular species synthesized in BHK cells. Fig. 6 shows the decay of radioactivity for different [3H]PS peaks, excluding those in which a major fraction of the radioactivity was not derived via [3H]PS decarboxylation. Note that some peaks that are minor or not well separated have been grouped together. The plots in"

Cell. 1989; 59: 293-303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The ability ofski to induce both transformation and muscle differentiation in the same cells (QEFs) is an intriguing paradox and suggests thatski plays a pivotal role in regulating cell growth and differentiation. That such a role for ski is conserved in other organisms is demonstrated by the phenotype of v-skitransgenic mice, which have increased muscle mass caused by hypertrophy of type II fast muscle fibers (9Sutrave P. Kelly A.M. Hughes S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1462-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Ski has been shown to affect the proliferation and differentiation of cells outside of the myogenic lineage as well. For example, v-ski transforms a myeloid-erythroid hematopoietic multipotential progenitor cell from avian bone marrow (10Larsen J. Meyer S. Steinlein P. Beug H. Hayman M.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3221-3228PubMed Google Scholar, 11Larsen J. Beug H. Hayman M.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1903-1911PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, mice that are homozygous for a null mutation in the c-ski gene have been generated. These mice die at birth and show a variety of developmental defects, including defective closure of the rostral neural tube and decrease in skeletal muscle mass (12Berk M. Desai S.Y. Heyman H.C. Colmenares C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2029-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).Because of its effect on muscle differentiation, upstream regulatory regions of muscle-specific genes were used in some initial studies of Ski's transcriptional regulatory properties. One such study showed that Ski stimulates transcription from the enhancers of both myosin light chain 1/3 and muscle creatine kinase by 2–3-fold in myoblasts in an E-box-dependent fashion (13Engert J.C. Servaes S. Sutrave P. Hughes S.H. Rosenthal N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2988-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, given the diverse biological consequences of Ski overexpression and loss of function, it is likely that Ski also regulates genes outside the myogenic lineage. Kelder and co-workers (14Kelder B. Richmond C. Stavnezer E. List E.O. Kopchick J.J. Gene (Amst.). 1998; (in press)Google Scholar) have shown that v-Ski, overexpressed in mouse L-cells, activates the SV40, human cytomegalovirus immediate early, and RSV long terminal repeat enhancers (14Kelder B. Richmond C. Stavnezer E. List E.O. Kopchick J.J. Gene (Amst.). 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that Ski can interact with the DNA binding site for the nuclear factor I (NFI) transcription factor family by protein-protein interaction with the NFI protein and potentiate NFI-stimulated transcription of a reporter that has multimerized NFI binding sites upstream of a TATA box element (15Tarapore P.

Stavnezer, manuscript in preparation.Recently, it has become clear that some transcription factors can regulate gene expression by interacting with multicomponent protein complexes (16Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 17Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol.

This allows a single transcription factor to interact with different binding sites, depending on the cellular context. The ability of Ski to affect transcription through E-box elements and to interact with the NFI binding site through interaction with the NFI protein suggests such a mechanism for Ski transcriptional regulation. The interaction of Ski with the NFI binding site was identified by cyclic amplification and selection of targets (CASTing), using a nuclear extract from v-ski-transduced mouse L-cells as the source of Ski protein (15Tarapore P. Richmond C. Zheng G. Cohen S.B. Kelder B. Kopchick J. Kruse U. Sippel A.E. Colmenares C. Stavnezer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3895-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19Wright W.E. Binder M. Funk W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4104-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Those cells are highly transformed, and v-ski overexpression appears to suppress their transformed phenotype. 3B. Kelder and J. Kopchick, manuscript in preparation. 3B. Kelder and J. Kopchick, manuscript in preparation.In the present work, we describe the identification of a second DNA binding site for the Ski protein that is more likely to be relevant to the process of transformation. For this purpose, we used a nuclear extract from c-ski-transformed CEFs (c-ski-CEFs), because CEFs, unlike L-cells, are transformed by overexpression of c-ski or v-ski. The binding site we have identified using this strategy has the sequence GTCTAGAC. There are no known cellular factors that have been previously characterized as binding to this sequence. We show that both v-Ski and c-Ski bind this element, and we examine the affinity of the interaction. Here we also show that Ski is able to repress transcription through multimerized copies of the GTCTAGAC binding site cloned upstream of a minimal promoter. This is the first demonstration of Ski acting as a repressor rather than an activator and could provide insight into the ability of Ski to induce both transformation and differentiation in cells depending on the cellular environment.DISCUSSIONIt is now clear that protein-protein interactions among DNA binding transcription factors play important roles in modulating both the DNA binding properties and transcriptional regulatory properties of such factors (16Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 17Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 18Herr W. Cleary M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Carrying out binding site selection using a nuclear extract as the source of protein has the advantage that the transcription factor can interact with a given DNA binding site while maintaining many of the same protein-protein interactions that would occur inside the cell. Using this approach, we have identified a novel DNA binding site for the Ski protein with the consensus sequence GTCTAGAC. Exogenous c-Ski in CEF nuclear extracts binds to this sequence with high affinity and specificity. v-Ski also binds to this binding site, but with lower affinity than c-Ski, probably due to the loss of the carboxyl-terminal dimerization domain. Furthermore, endogenous Ski proteins from chicken, mouse, and human all bind to this GTCT element, suggesting that binding to this site may be important for the normal function of Ski.Structure of Binding Site and Analysis of Binding Site MutantsThe GTCT consensus is extraordinarily conserved in the oligomers that we identified by CASTing. There is only a single base change in one of the 20 GTCT/2 oligomers, and none of the GTCT/1.5 oligomers had any substitutions in the first copy of the consensus. We were surprised that none of the binding sites contained two imperfect copies of the GTCT element. The reason for this observation became apparent when we analyzed binding affinities by competition. All of the symmetrical single base substitutions that we made in the GTCT/2 binding site dramatically reduced the binding affinity, such that it was equivalent to or less than that of a single copy binding site. On the other hand, GTCT/1.5 sites with 0–3 base pairs between GTCT elements and two or more base substitutions in one element have only slightly lower binding affinity than GTCT/2. This demonstrates that at least one perfect copy of the binding site is essential for stable Ski complex formation and provides strong evidence for cooperative binding to multiple GTCT elements.Composition of the Two Ski DNA Binding ComplexesNeither purified bacterially produced Ski nor in vitro translated Ski binds the GTCT element. Possible explanations for this failure include the following: 1) bacterially produced and in vitrotranslated Ski protein may not fold properly; 2) Ski may contain an autoinhibitory domain that prevents DNA binding; 3) post-translational modification such as phosphorylation may be required; 4) a protein cofactor may be required to stabilize Ski's interaction with the DNA. The first explanation is unlikely because bacterially produced and in vitro translated Ski proteins have been shown to dimerize efficiently, and analysis of in vitro translated Ski by partial proteolytic digestion indicates that it is correctly folded (29Zheng G. Teumer J. Colmenares C. Richmond C. Stavnezer E. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Autoinhibitory domains have been shown to regulate DNA binding of such transcription factors as ETS-1 and p53; however, in these cases the inhibition of DNA binding is relieved by deletion of the autoinhibitory domains (36Jonsen M.D. Petersen J.M. Xu Q.P. Graves B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 37Hupp T.R. Sparks A. Lane D.P.

Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). We have performed EMSAs with various deleted forms of in vitro translated Ski, but no deletions have been identified that enable the Ski protein to bind the GTCT element (data not shown). Previous work by Sutrave et al.(20Sutrave P. Copeland T.D. Showalter S.D. Hughes S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3137-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) has shown that chicken c-Ski is a phosphoprotein, whereas v-Ski is not. Because both c-Ski and v-Ski can bind to DNA, it is unlikely that phosphorylation is required for DNA binding of chicken Ski proteins. Ishii and co-workers (1Nagase T. Mizuguchi G. Nomura N. Ishizaki R. Ueno Y. Ishii S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have presented evidence indicating that Ski requires a cofactor present in a nuclear extract from Molt 4 cells to bind DNA. The Ski homologue, SnoN, which has been shown to heterodimerize efficiently with Ski (5Heyman H.C. Stavnezer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26996-27003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Nagase T. Nomura N. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13710-13716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is an obvious candidate for a Ski-GTCT co-binding partner. For this reason, we performed EMSAs with Ski and Sno heterodimers formed by co-in vitro translation, but no binding to the GTCT site was detected (data not shown).In this study, we provide evidence for additional factors that interact specifically with the GTCT element. The non-Ski-containing complex X, which binds GTCT/2 specifically, migrates faster than Ski-containing complexes in EMSAs. It is possible that Ski associates with the components of this complex to form a ternary complex with further reduced mobility. This would account for the reduced level of complex X in c-ski-CEFs relative to normal CEFs. Interestingly, there is more complex X visible in gel shifts with v-ski-CEF extract than with c-ski-CEF extract, suggesting that v-Ski might form an unstable association with complex X. It is possible that we have identified the components of complex X as the four species (two sets of doublets) that cross-link specifically to the BrdUrd-substituted probe in addition to Ski.The fact that Ski can be UV-cross-linked to a GTCT probe indicates that it probably contains a domain that makes contacts within the Van der Waals radius of the DNA (31Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 516-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). There are a number of mechanisms by which Ski could co-bind to the GTCT site along with other proteins and still play a role in specific sequence recognition. For example, another protein could bind in an overlapping complex with the Ski protein and stabilize Ski binding by cooperative interaction. The yeast proteins Mcm1 and MATα2 (α2) provide an example of proteins that bind cooperatively to overlapping DNA binding sites (39Keleher C.A. Passmore S. Johnson A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5228-5230Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 40Passmore S. Elble R. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 921-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although α2 binds to DNA on its own (41Sauer R.T. Smith D.L. Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), interaction with Mcm1 increases the affinity of α2 for operator sites and extends the DNA binding specificity of α2 (42Zhong H. Vershon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8402-8409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Alternatively, there are transcriptional co-regulatory proteins, such as the B-cell-specific factor Bob-1/OBF-1/OCA-B or the viral transactivator VP16, that associate with site-specific transcription factors and can stabilize interaction of these factors with a subset of binding sites (18Herr W. Cleary M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 43Gstaiger M. Georgiev O. van Leeuwen H. van der Vliet P. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2781-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is possible that in the case of Ski, such an intimate association with the DNA binding domain of another protein could bring Ski into close enough proximity with DNA bases to allow UV cross-linking. It is true that cross-linking of Ski to the GTCT binding site seems to be less efficient than that of the unidentified components of the GTCT complexes.Role of Ski Dimerization in Cooperative Binding to the GTCT ElementExogenous c-Ski forms two complexes with GTCT/2 and GTCT1.5 probes (complex 1 and complex 2). The faster migrating form has the same mobility as the single complex that forms with the GTCT/1 probe. Since Ski is present in both complexes 1 and 2, the simplest model for the composition of these complexes is that complex 1 represents a Ski monomer plus associated proteins bound to a single GTCT site and complex 2 is a dimer of these elements. This suggestion fits nicely with the observations that binding of Ski to the GTCT/2 element is highly cooperative and that c-Ski dimerizes efficiently through a carboxyl-terminal dimerization domain (5Heyman H.C. Stavnezer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26996-27003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Nagase T. Nomura N. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13710-13716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This model also agrees with the observation that v-Ski, which lacks this high affinity dimerization domain, binds to the GTCT/2 site much less efficiently than c-Ski. On the other hand, it predicts that the two Ski forms should be very similar in binding to GTCT/1, because in this case dimers would not be required. However, we investigated binding of v-Ski to the GTCT/1 element and were unable to detect the formation of a shifted band by EMSA.The weak binding of v-Ski to GTCT/2 and its failure to bind GTCT/1 suggest that dimerization of Ski is important for binding to both single copy and double copy binding sites. This conclusion is contrary to the model described above and provides support for an alternative model in which a Ski dimer and associated proteins bind to each copy of the GTCT element. Cooperative binding to the GTCT/2 site then occurs by interaction between adjacent Ski dimers bound to DNA. Because the rate-limiting step in cooperative binding is the first step, the carboxyl-terminal dimerization domain of c-Ski greatly enhances cooperative binding by stabilizing dimers so that they can bind effectively to a single element. Accordingly, v-Ski is impaired in binding GTCT/1 because its dimers are unstable, but it is able to bind GTCT/2 because the cooperative interaction on DNA stabilizes two weakly associated dimers. This model is consistent with our previous data that demonstrated low affinity multimer formation by v-Ski (5Heyman H.C. Stavnezer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26996-27003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Ski Represses Transcription through the GTCT Binding SiteHere we demonstrate for the first time that both c-Ski and v-Ski can repress transcription. c-Ski is shown to be a stronger repressor than v-Ski, and this difference is consistent with their relative abilities to bind the GTCT element and is mirrored by their relative transforming activity. Repression by Ski cannot be explained by competition with an activator for binding to the GTCT site, because c-Ski linked to an unrelated DNA binding domain is able to repress transcription of a cognate reporter. Therefore, Ski can be classified as an active repressor (35Hanna-Rose W. Hansen U. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Mechanisms of active repression include interfering with the activity of a DNA-bound activator (44Zhou Q. Gedrich R.W. Engel D.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4323-4330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and interacting with the basal transcription machinery (45Sauer F. Fondell J.D. Ohkuma Y. Roeder R.G. Jackle H. Nature. 1995; 375: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) or with histone deacetylases (46Wolffe A.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 16-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Often these interactions are mediated by corepressors, as in the case of thyroid hormone receptor and the Krüppel-associated box domain-containing proteins (17Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 47Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Huang X.P. Neilson E.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Since the minimum transforming region of Ski has been localized to the N-terminal 304 residues (29Zheng G. Teumer J. Colmenares C. Richmond C. Stavnezer E. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to determine whether this region contains the repression domain.In light of the fact that Ski can activate transcription from some muscle-specific and viral enhancers and promoters, it was surprising to find that Ski represses transcription through the GTCT binding site. However, there are now numerous examples of transcription factors that can act as either activators or repressors depending on protein-protein interactions dictated by the promoter and physiological context (48Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1995; 375: 105-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although Ski appears to activate transcription by interacting with other DNA-bound transcription factors, including the myogenic regulatory factors (13Engert J.C. Servaes S. Sutrave P. Hughes S.H. Rosenthal N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2988-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and members of the NFI family (15Tarapore P. Richmond C. Zheng G. Cohen S.B. Kelder B. Kopchick J. Kruse U. Sippel A.E. Colmenares C. Stavnezer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3895-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar),2 we have been unable to identify an activation domain by fusing various regions of Ski with an independent DNA binding domain (data not shown). In the case of repression through binding to the GTCT binding site, Ski's action appears to be different. Although Ski requires cofactors to bind to this sequence, it appears to possess a repression domain that can function independently of these proteins. However, further characterization of the factors that co-bind to the GTCT site along with Ski will be required to determine the role that Ski plays in repressing transcription through this binding site.The ability of Ski to cause oncogenic transformation and induce terminal muscle differentiation in the same cells has been a paradox. Previous results showing transcriptional activation by Ski are now contrasted by our findings that it can act as a transcriptional repressor. It is interesting that the duality inherent in the biological activities of the Ski protein is thereby reflected at the transcriptional level. This makes it tempting to speculate that the opposite biological activities are coupled to the opposite transcriptional activities. However, this will remain only an attractive speculation until the key genes activated and repressed by Ski are identified. c-Ski is an 84-kDa nuclear protein that has been shown to bind DNA when a complementing activity is supplied by a nuclear extract (1Nagase T. Mizuguchi G. Nomura N. Ishizaki R. Ueno Y. Ishii S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). v-Ski is a truncated form of the c-Ski protein that is missing 20 amino acids from the amino terminus and 292 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus (2Barkas A.E. Brodeur D. Stavnezer E. Virology. 1986; 151: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 3Stavnezer E. Brodeur D. Brennan L.A. Mol. Cell.

This truncation, which removes a carboxyl-terminal dimerization domain, plays no role in the activation of skias an oncogene (5Heyman H.C. Stavnezer E. J. Biol.

Ski has been shown to affect the proliferation and differentiation of cells outside of the myogenic lineage as well. For example, v-ski transforms a myeloid-erythroid hematopoietic multipotential progenitor cell from avian bone marrow (10Larsen J. Meyer S. Steinlein P. Beug H. Hayman M.J.

Nothing is known, however, about the cell biology of complex formation. The inability of Kir6.2 subunits to function as K+ channels in the absence of SUR1 (Inagaki et al. (2Inagaki N. Gonoi T.

Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar)) may be due to trafficking failure and raises the possibility that one role of SUR1 is to act as a chaperone to permit Kir6.2 subunits to form into a tetramer and/or to traffic to the surface membrane (5Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Conversely, there is no direct demonstration of the surface expression of SUR1 independent of association with Kir6.2 in the KATP complex. Ozanneet al. (10Ozanne S.E. Guest P.C. Hutton J.C. Hales C.N. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) showed that whereas a 170-kDa sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) 1The abbreviations used are: SUR, sulfonylurea receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; BHK, baby hamster kidney; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. 1The abbreviations used are: SUR, sulfonylurea receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; BHK, baby hamster kidney; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. was present in the plasma membrane, a 140-kDa form was only present on internal membranes. Clement et al. (8Clement J.P., IV Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) show that SUR1 is seen as a core-glycosylated 140-kDa species seen when expressed in the absence of Kir6.2 but that a higher order (170 kDa) species is seen when coexpressed with Kir6.2. Together, these results might suggest that SUR1 cannot reach the surface membrane in the absence of Kir6.2. In the present study we have utilized green fluorescence protein (GFP) labeling to visualize in vivo Kir6.2 and SUR1 targeting in mammalian cells and to address the question of whether Kir6.2 trafficking to the cell membrane is dependent on association with SUR1 subunits. The results indicate that both SUR1 and Kir6.2 can independently traffic toward the cell membrane. GFP optimized for maximal fluorescence (11Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene. 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar) was fused to the N or C terminus of Kir6.2 (GFP-Kir6.2 and Kir6.2-GFP, respectively) or to the C terminus of SUR1 (SUR1-GFP) using an overlapping PCR technique. In the latter case, a linker of six glycine residues was placed in between SUR1 and GFP. A dimeric SUR1-Kir6.2 construct (7Shyng S.-L. Nichols C.G. J. Gen.

Kir6.2 and its derivatives were expressed under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter in pCMV6 vector and SUR1-containing constructs in pECE expression vector. GFP-tagged β-1,4-galactosyltransferase gene was a gift from Dr. Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz (12Cole N.B. Smith C.L. Sciaky N. Terasaki M. Edidin M. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Science. 1996; 273: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). COSm6, HEK293, and BHK cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's suggestions for microscopy and electrophysiology or by a DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method for rubidium flux measurements. In the latter case, cells were plated on glass coverslips at a density of 0.5–2.5 × 105 cells/well (30-mm six-well dishes) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10 mm glucose supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%). The following day, 5 μg of total cDNA was transfected into COSm6 cells with diethylaminoethyl dextran (0.5 mg/ml). Cells were incubated for 2 min in HEPES-buffered salt solution containing Me2SO (10%) and then for 4 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10 mm glucose plus 2% fetal calf serum and chloroquine (100 μm) and then returned to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10 mm glucose plus 10% fetal calf serum. 86RbCl (1 mCi/ml) was added in fresh growth medium 24 h after transfection. Cells were incubated for 12–24 h before measurement of Rb efflux. For efflux measurements, cells were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C in Krebs-Ringer solution with or without metabolic inhibitors (2.5 mg/ml oligomycin plus 1 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose). At selected time points, the solution was aspirated from the cells and replaced with fresh solution. The 86Rb+ in the aspirated solution was counted. Cells were cultivated for 24–72 h after transfection and photographed in UV light under 1,000 × magnification in a Zeiss microscope equipped with a 515-nm emission filter. Confocal analysis was performed using an argon-krypton laser (Bio-Rad). Green fluorescence was detected at λ = 515 nm after excitation at λ = 488 nm. Cells were observed on thin coverslips used for their plating or after being treated with 0.1% trypsin for 30 s and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Digitized images from confocal experiments were prepared for presentation using Corel Photopaint (Corel Inc.). Patch-clamp experiments were made at room temperature in a chamber that allowed the solution bathing the exposed surface of the isolated patch to be changed in less than 50 ms. Shards of glass were removed from the culture dishes and placed in the experimental chamber. Micropipettes were pulled from thin-walled glass (WPI Inc., New Haven, CT) on a horizontal puller (Sutter Instrument, Co., Novato, CA). Membrane patches were voltage-clamped with an Axopatch 1B patch-clamp (Axon Inc., Foster City, CA). PClamp software and a Labmaster TL125 D/A converter (Axon Inc.) were used to generate voltage pulses. Data were normally filtered at 0.5–3 kHz, and signals were digitized at 22 kHz (Neurocorder, Neurodata, NY, NY) and stored on video tape. Experiments were replayed onto a chart recorder or digitized into a microcomputer using Axotape software (Axon Inc.). The standard bath (intracellular) and pipette (extracellular) solution had the following composition: 140 mm KCl, 10 mm K-HEPES, 1 mm K-EGTA, pH 7.3, with additions as described. Off-line analysis was performed using ClampFit and Microsoft Excel programs. Wherever possible, data are presented as mean ± S.E. (standard error). Microsoft Solver was used to fit data by a least-square algorithm. To follow KATP channel activity in living cells, GFP was fused to the C terminus of SUR1 (SUR1-GFP) or to the N or C terminus of Kir6.2 (GFP-Kir6.2 or Kir6.2-GFP). To examine functional integrity of chimeric channels, SUR1-GFP was cotransfected with Kir6.2, and Kir6.2-GFP or GFP-Kir6.2 was cotransfected with SUR1 into COSm6 cells. Rubidium efflux measurements performed on the metabolically inhibited transfectants (Fig. 1 A) show that functional KATP channels are formed from each tagged construct when coexpressed with the complementary subunit. Neither GFP-tagged construct of Kir6.2 showed detectable channel activity in the absence of coexpression with SUR1, based on rubidium efflux measurements (not shown). Further characterization of GFP-tagged channels constructs was made using patch-clamp experiments. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, each of the tagged constructs generated channels that were inhibited by ATP. The tagged SUR1 and Kir6.2 monomers, when coexpressed with the relevant other subunit, generated channels with wild type ATP sensitivity ([ATP] causing half-maximal inhibition (K i) = 13.5 μm and 8.6 μm for SUR1-GFP + Kir6.2 and Kir6.2-GFP + SUR1, respectively, cf. 11.1 μm for wild type channels). SUR1-Kir6.2-GFP triple fusions generated functional channels in the absence of additional subunits. These channels were less sensitive to ATP inhibition, the fitted K i (39.1 μm) being very similar to that seen with expression of untagged SUR1-Kir6.2 dimeric fusion proteins (45.3 μm, Ref. 7Shyng S.-L. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 654-655Google Scholar; Ref. 8Clement J.P., IV Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The functional similarity of tagged channels to the wild type enables us to use them as analogs of the authentic KATP channel in studying channel biogenesis. When GFP is fused to Kir6.2, a strongly fluorescent protein is produced in transfected cells and allows us to follow the fate of the Kir6.2 subunit in vivo. When coexpressed with SUR1 to generate functional KATP channels, the intracellular distribution of GFP-tagged Kir6.2 clearly differs from the distribution of free GFP, as shown in populations of transfected BHK cells (Fig. 2) and in individual COSm6 cells at higher magnification in Fig. 3. A strong signal associated with Kir6.2 is concentrated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and perinuclear space, which contains the Golgi complex (Fig. 3 C). Unfortunately, contrast plasma membrane fluorescence is not obvious in adherent COSm6 cells. To reveal the surface signal, we minimized the cell surface by mild trypsinization immediately before confocal analysis. With visualization in a confocal microscope, edge fluorescence is clearly visible in Kir6.2-GFP + SUR1-transfected COSm6 cells (Fig. 3 D) but is absent in control cells expressing GFP alone (Fig. 3 B) or GFP-tagged β-1,4-galactosyltransferase, an integral membrane protein that resides in the Golgi but not in the plasma membrane (Fig. 3 F, Ref. 12Cole N.B.

Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), nearly identical fluorescence patterns were observed when GFP-tagged Kir6.2 constructs were expressed with (Fig. 3, C and D) or without SUR1 (Fig. 4, A and B). Adherent transfected COSm6 cells show the Kir6.2-GFP subunit entering the secretory pathway, but again, a visible plasma membrane signal is not obvious (Fig. 4 A). Again, however, a clear edge fluorescence is apparent after mild trypsinization (Fig. 4 B). Adherent HEK293 cells (Fig. 5) do not spread so thinly on coverslips, and in this case, edge fluorescence is visible in Kir6.2-GFP single transfectants (Fig. 5 A). Since Kir6.2-GFP showed no electrical activity when expressed alone, we could not confirm membrane localization functionally. As a positive control of a homomeric, integral membrane protein with assessable expression, we studied Kir2.3 (HRK1) inward rectifier channel (13Makhina E.N. Kelly A.J. Lopatin A.N. Mercer R.W. Nichols C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20468-20474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) subunits fused at the C terminus to GFP. Kir2.3-GFP chimeric channels conduct inward rectifier K+ currents with wild type efficiency (14Makhina E.N. Sha Q. Nichols C.G. Biophys. J. 1997; 72 (abstr.): 253Google Scholar) and show essentially identical fluorescence patterns to those seen in Kir6.2-GFP cells (Figs. 4, C and D, and 5 B).Figure 5Fluorescence associated with GFP-tagged inward rectifier subunits in HEK293 cells. Fluorescent images of HEK293 cells expressing Kir6.2-GFP alone (A), Kir2.3-GFP (B), SUR-GFP alone (C), and SUR-Kir6.2-GFP (WTF-GFP) (D) are shown. The calibrationbar represents 3 μm in each case.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Coexpression of Kir6.2-GFP with SUR1 (in ∼1:1 cDNA ratio), which results in characteristic KATP currents (Fig. 1), does not obviously affect the intracellular distribution of Kir6.2-GFP (Fig. 4, A and B, cf. Fig. 3, C and D). One possible reason is that in coexpression, the predominant Kir6.2 signal that we observe is still actually from non-SUR1-associated subunits. To examine whether the distribution of SUR1-associated Kir6.2 differs from the distribution of Kir6.2 alone, we transfected cells with a SUR1-Kir6.2 tandem (8Clement J.P., IV Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) tagged at the C-terminal end with GFP (SUR1-Kir6.2-GFP). This triple-fusion construct, lacking free Kir6.2 subunits, shows ER, Golgi, and cell surface fluorescence of a similar intensity to cells expressing Kir6.2-GFP in both COSm6 cells (Fig. 4, E and F) and in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5 D). Since Kir6.2-GFP can traffic toward the plasma membrane independently of SUR1, we addressed the question of whether SUR1 is capable of Kir6.2-independent trafficking to the plasma membrane? COSm6 cells were transfected with SUR1-GFP with or without additional Kir subunits (Figs. 6, 7). In COSm6 cells, SUR1-GFP fluorescence also localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, perinuclear space (Fig. 6 A), and plasma membrane (Fig. 5 C) in untreated cells, and plasma membrane fluorescence is also clearly visible in trypsinized COSm6 cells (Fig. 6 B). However, a strikingly different fluorescence pattern was observed when SUR1-GFP was cotransfected with Kir6.2 (Fig. 6 C), indicating a physical interaction. The perinuclear and reticular distribution was substantially replaced by a diffuse fluorescence across the cell (Fig. 6 C), although membrane fluorescence was still clearly visible in trypsinized cells (Fig. 6 D). As shown in Fig. 7, this effect of Kir6.2 coexpression is specific. When SUR1-GFP is coexpressed with Kir1.1 (Fig. 7 C) or Kir2.3 (Fig. 7 D), which do not interact with SUR1, the fluorescence is not different from that seen with expression of SUR1-GFP alone (Fig. 7 A).Figure 7Fluorescence associated with GFP-tagged SUR1 subunits indicates a specific interaction with Kir6.2.Fluorescent images of COSm6 cells expressing SUR-GFP alone (A), SUR-GFP and Kir6.2 (B), SUR-GFP and Kir1.1 (C), and SUR-GFP and Kir2.3 (D) are shown. The calibration bar represents 8 μm in each case.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Neither receptor (SUR1) nor pore-forming (Kir6.2) subunits of the KATP channel normally demonstrate a plasma membrane-associated phenotype, with the exception of sulfonylurea binding to SUR1 in total membranes (3Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P., IV Boyd III, A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar), when expressed in the absence of the other subunit. SUR1 appears as a core-glycosylated 140-kDa species in the absence of Kir6.2 (8Clement J.P., IV Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), and this species does not appear to reach the plasma membrane in various insulin-secreting cell lines (10Ozanne S.E. Guest P.C. Hutton J.C. Hales C.N. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A C-terminal deletion construct (5Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M.

Ribalet, personal communication. may form some active ATP-sensitive K+ channels in the absence of SUR1, but in both cases a considerably higher level of channel expression is observed when coexpressed with SUR1. Lack of channel function when wild type Kir6.2 is expressed without SUR1 may be due to an inability to express stably or to reach the cell surface and reside there for a physiologically significant period of time. The general concept of multimeric integral membrane protein biogenesis is that subunits assemble in early steps and are co-transported through the Golgi complex and the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane (reviewed in Ref. 15Rose J.K. Doms R.W. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Unincorporated subunits typically do not reach the plasma membrane because of proteolytic degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum or in lysosomes. The T-cell antigen receptor, consisting of seven transmembrane subunits, provides an example of both degradation pathways. Although the fully assembled, seven-membered complex is transported to the plasma membrane, free α, γ, and δ chains rapidly degrade in the endoplasmic reticulum, and pentamers lacking the ζ chain pass the Golgi complex but are then redirected to lysosomes (reviewed in Ref. 16Klausner R.D. Sitia R. Cell. 1990; 62: 611-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). To explore the possibility that a similar degradation of free KATP subunits underlies the lack of functional channels in different expression conditions, we labeled them with GFP and followed their fate in living cells. Both SUR1-GFP and Kir6.2-GFP were observed in ER, Golgi, and cell surface compartments, indicating that neither unincorporated subunit contains any specific signal for rapid and effective proteolytic degradation in the ER or rerouting to lysosomes. With a few exceptions (e.g. connexin-43, gap-junction channel, type 2 sodium channel) where oligomerization takes place after exit (17Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 1065-1077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 18Green W.N. Millar N.S. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 280-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), subunit assembly of integral membrane proteins generally occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, and proteins that fail to assemble into requisite oligomeric complexes are degraded without release from the endoplasmic reticulum (16Klausner R.D. Sitia R. Cell. 1990; 62: 611-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). In contrast to Kv1.2 or Kv2.2 channels, where auxiliary β subunits promote surface staining with antibodies raised against α-subunits (19Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L.E. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 20Salinas M. de Weille J. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. Hugnot J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8774-8780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), coexpression of KATPchannel subunits does not obviously change the expression pattern of individual subunits. The stability of free KATP channel subunits in the secretory pathway indicates that assembly is not necessary for trafficking without necessarily implying that assembly into the functional complex should normally occur after independently reaching the plasma membrane. The formation of functional channels by the SUR1-Kir6.2-GFP triple fusion construct together with the visible intracellular distribution (Fig. 4, E and F) shows that preassembled SUR1 plus Kir6.2 dimer is also not subject to endoplasmic reticular or lysosomal degradation and is as viable outside the plasma membrane as the individual subunits. The effect of coexpression with Kir6.2 on the intracellular distribution of SUR1-GFP (Figs. 6 and 7) indicates a specific physical interaction between SUR1 and Kir6.2, since coexpression with other noninteracting Kir subunits (Kir1.1, Kir2.3) has no effect on the SUR1-GFP fluorescence (Fig. 7). A complex picture is beginning to emerge for KATP channel formation. The demonstration that the channel requires two subunits (2Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P. Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar) and recent indications of an obligate stoichiometry (7Shyng S.-L. Nichols C.G. J. Gen.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) might suggest a classical endoplasmic reticular oligomeric assembly (21Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) in which each subunit is necessary for normal trafficking. On the other hand, Ammala et al. (22Ammala C. Moorhouse A. Gribble F. Ashfield R. Proks P. Smith P, A. Sakura H. Coles B. Ashcroft S.J. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) reported that coexpression with SUR1 was capable of conferring sulfonylurea sensitivity on Kir1.1 channels, which can clearly function in the absence of SUR1 (23Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) and suggested that SUR1 may “promiscuously” couple to different inward rectifier subunits. In the present study, we find that SUR1-GFP fluorescence patterns are affected specifically by expression with Kir6.2 but not by expression with Kir1.1 or Kir2.3. Together with the demonstration that azidoglibenclamide can label Kir6.2, but not Kir1.1, in coexpression with SUR1 (8Clement J.P., IV Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), these results indicate that SUR1 does not in fact interact promiscuously with other Kir subunits and interacts specifically with Kir6.x subunits. The present results further indicate that independent trafficking of each subunit toward the cell membrane can occur, but altered fluorescence of SUR1-GFP when coexpressed with Kir6.2 indicates a specific interaction and suggests the following as a working hypothesis. Independent synthesis of Kir6.2 tetramers (7Shyng S.-L. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 654-655Google Scholar) and SUR1, perhaps as monomers, can occur in the endoplasmic reticulum, and these homomeric constructs can traffic to the surface membrane. However, when both subunits are coexpressed, as happens in native cells, a physical interaction between SUR1 and Kir6.2 occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, possibly involving the C terminus of SUR1, which either facilitates insertion of channel-containing vesicles into the plasma membrane or stabilizes channels once inserted into the plasma membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2164594322,"Using a solid phase assay, we show that isolated LFA-1 I domain binds ICAM-1 in a Mg2+-dependent manner and is blocked by anti-I domain monoclonal antibodies. This activity mirrors that of the intact receptor (Dransfield, I., Cabañas, C., Craig, A., and Hogg, N. (1992) J. Cell Biol. 116, 219–226) and suggests that the I domain controls divalent cation-dependent receptor function. In ICAM-1, domain 1 residues Glu-34 and Gln-73 have been identified as critical for binding of LFA-1 as an intact receptor (Staunton, D. E., Dustin, M. L., Erickson, H. P., and Springer, T. A. (1990) Cell 61, 243–254). For the first time, we show that isolated I domain binds to domain 1 of ICAM-1 and that this interaction is inhibited partially by mutation of Glu-34 but not by Gln-73. The anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody RR1/1, which maps to Gln-73 (Staunton, D. E., Dustin, M. L., Erickson, H. P., and Springer, T. A. (1990) Cell 61, 243–254), enhances I domain binding, suggesting potential allosteric control or coordinate binding by this region. Finally, I domain binding inhibited by Glu-34 ICAM-1 mutation correlates with divalent cation dependence, indicating that this residue might be in direct contact with the metal ion-dependent adhesion site. Thus, we describe the interaction between the LFA-1 I domain and ICAM-1, an event that controls the function of the intact receptor but includes only part of the complete ligand binding site.

Cell-cell interactions have an essential role in maintaining an immune response and are a requirement for effective functioning of leukocytes (3Springer T.A.

For example, adhesion of leukocytes to endothelium is critical for their transmigration from the circulation to sites of inflammation, and firm contact with antigen-presenting cells is required for T lymphocyte stimulation and proliferation.

ICAM-1 is the principle ligand for LFA-1 in many of its interactions. Mutagenesis studies of ICAM-1 have shown the residues Glu-34 and Gln-73 in domain 1 to be essential for binding of purified LFA-1 to ICAM-1 (2Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A.

The importance of these residues in adhesion has also been established for other IgSF adhesion ligands, where residues in homologous positions are both conserved and essential for integrin function; for example, ICAM-3 contains Gln-75 and Glu-37 (7Sadhu S.

Eight integrins have an I domain in the α subunit to which ligand binding sites have been mapped (13Hogg N. Landis R.C. Bates P.A. Stanley P. Randi A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 379-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In LFA-1, the I domain contains a major ICAM-1 binding site (14Randi A.M. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12395-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The I domains of the two β2 integrins LFA-1 and Mac-1 have recently been crystallized and an important part of the structure shown to be a Mg2+/Mn2+ binding site termed the MIDAS motif (15Lee J.-O.

Since divalent cations are required by integrins for activity this suggests an important role for the I domain in activation as well as ligand binding. Other regions of LFA-1 that have been implicated in binding to ICAM-1 and also potentially bind to divalent cation are domains V/VI of the α subunit (18Stanley P. Bates P.A. Harvey J. Bennett R.I. Hogg N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1790-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and the I domain-like region of the β2 subunit (19Goodman T.G. Bajt M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23729-23736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Whether these different domains form one large ligand binding pocket or bind ICAM-1 separately remains to be determined (13Hogg N. Landis R.C. Bates P.A. Stanley P. Randi A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 379-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this study, we use an isolated LFA-1 I domain to locate residues of ICAM-1 that interact with this domain. The following monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were used in this study. Anti-LFA-1 (CD11a) mAbs mapping to the I domain (14Randi A.M. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12395-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were mAb 38 (this laboratory), MEM 25, MEM 30, MEM 83 (gifts from Dr. V. Horesji, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Prague), and F110.22 (gift from Dr. T. Plesner, Herlev Hospital, Denmark). Anti-ICAM-1 (CD54) mAbs were 15.2 (this laboratory), RR1/1 (gift from Dr. R. Rothlein, Boehringer Ingleheim, Inc., Ridgefield), 8.4A6 (gift from Dr. D. Haskard, RPMS, Hammersmith Hospital, London) and WEHI-CAM-1 (gift from Dr. A. Boyd, Queensland Institute for Medical Research, Australia). The anti-CD64 mAb 10.1 (this laboratory) was used most frequently as a control. Chimeric wild type (wt) ICAM-1Fc protein consists of the five extracellular domains of ICAM-1 plus the hinge, CH2, and CH3 domains of IgG1 (20Berendt A.R. McDowall A. Craig A.G. Bates P.A. Sternberg M.J.E. Marsh K. Newbold C.I. Hogg N. Cell. 1992; 68: 71-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The cDNA construct was ligated into the vector pEE14 and stably transfected into CHO-K1 cells by calcium phosphate precipitation (21Bebbington C.R. Renner G. Thomson S. King D. Abrams D. Yarranton G.T. BioTechniques. 1992; 10: 169-175Crossref Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Protein was isolated from high expressing transfectants after 10 days in serum-free medium. ICAM-1Fc mutants E34A and Q73N were made by polymerase chain reaction using site-directed mutagenesis by standard protocols and were fully sequenced by dideoxy sequencing. Proteins were synthesized by electroporated COS cells and collected in serum-free medium for up to 4 days. All proteins were purified on a Protein A-Sepharose column and eluted with 0.1 m citrate, pH 3.0, using standard methods. The VCAM-1Fc chimeric protein contains VCAM-1 domains 1 and 2 and the same Fc domain as ICAM-1Fc (22Jakubowski A. Rosa M.D. Bixler S. Lobb R. Burkly L.C. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1995; 3: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (a kind gift from Dr. R. Lobb, Biogen). Both ICAM-1Fc and VCAM-1Fc were equally able to bind stimulated T cells at equivalent molarity. 2J. Porter, personal communication. The LFA-1 I domain (Leu-111 to Ser-327) including the predicted sequence and a 17-amino acid N-terminal extension, was made by polymerase chain reaction from an LFA-1 α subunit cDNA by a standard protocol and ligated into the vector pGEX2T (Pharmacia Biotech) to produce an I-GST coding sequence. The sequenced DNA was transformed into Escherichia coli Topp 2 (Stratagene) and grown to log phase before inducing with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. I-GST was extracted from bacterial pellets using the GST purification module kit (Pharmacia) essentially following the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated I domain was made by cleaving directly from glutathione-Sepharose with thrombin. The I-GST and I domain proteins ran as single bands of ∼50 and 25 kDa, respectively, on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were tested by ELISA with 10 I domain mAbs (14Randi A.M. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12395-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and shown to express all epitopes. The I-GST protein was stable for 4–6 weeks, but the cleaved I domain frequently lost activity in less than 1 week. The wells of Maxisorp 96-well plates (Nunc) were coated for 16 h with 500–750 ng/well ICAM-1Fc in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, then blocked with 3% BSA (Calbiochem) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl (TBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed three times with TBS, and 50 μl/well I-GST diluted in TBS, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA was added and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Bound I-GST and GST were detected with 50 μl/well rabbit anti-GST antibody at 5 μg/ml (Sigma) in TBS, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml BSA for 30 min at room temperature followed by 50 μl of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dako) diluted 1:1000 in TBS, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml BSA added for 30 min at room temperature. The wells were washed three times with TBS between each layer. Bound I-GST was detected with 75 μl/well 0.5 mg/mlo-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma, made up as recommended), added for 10 min, stopped by addition of 50 μl of 3m H2SO4 and plates read in an ELISA reader at 492 nm. In experiments where isolated I domain was used, it was detected using 5 μg/ml mAb F110.22 followed by a 1:1000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Dako). When divalent cations or blocking antibodies were added, these and the I-GST were made up to 2-fold concentrations and 30 μl of each added to the wells. I-GST or GST was always added last. Comparison of binding between VCAM-1Fc and ICAM-1Fc or I-GST and GST used equimolar concentrations as determined by protein estimation and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These assays were carried out as described previously (1Dransfield I. Cabañas C. Craig A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 107 T cells were labeled with 25 μCi of [3H]thymidine for 16 h at 37 °C, washed three times in HEPES buffer, and 2 × 105 cells/well in HEPES buffer containing 2 mmMgCl2 and 1 mm EGTA were added to 96-well plates coated with ICAM-1Fc. Blocking control mAbs were added at 10 μg/ml. Plates were spun down and incubated at 37 °C for 35 min. Wells were washed three times, harvested, and read in a Betaplate counter (Pharmacia). The location of the LFA-1 I domain binding site on ICAM-1 has not been identified, but residues Glu-34 and Gln-73 in domain 1 of ICAM-1 have been demonstrated to be critical for binding of the intact integrin LFA-1 (2Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 5Fisher K.L. Lu J. Riddle L. Kim K.J. Presta L.G. Bodary S.C. Mol. Biol.

Proteins. 1996; 26: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Previous studies have showed the sensitivity of LFA-1 to these mutated ICAM-1 proteins expressed as cell transfectants. Here, we confirm this finding by mutating these residues in an ICAM-1Fc chimeric protein and showing that neither mutant E34A nor Q73N ICAM-1Fc immobilized on plastic support any T cell adhesion compared with wt ICAM-1Fc (Fig. 1). Nine mAbs specific for epitopes in ICAM-1 domains 1 and 2 (20Berendt A.R. McDowall A. Craig A.G. Bates P.A. Sternberg M.J.E. Marsh K. Newbold C.I. Hogg N. Cell. 1992; 68: 71-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) bound wt ICAM-1Fc and the two mutants to an equivalent extent, showing that the mutant proteins are correctly folded (data not shown). The epitope recognized by mAb RR1/1 is eliminated by Q73N mutation as shown previously (2Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). To investigate the specificity of LFA-1 I domain binding to ligand, we tested the ability of isolated recombinant I domain to bind to ICAM-1Fc in a solid phase assay. The specificity of adhesion is demonstrated by the ability of LFA-1 I domain, as a GST fusion or cleaved protein, to bind immobilized ICAM-1Fc in a saturable fashion compared with a lack of binding to either BSA (Fig. 2 A) or a second IgSF, protein VCAM-1Fc (Fig. 2 B). The GST fusion partner protein expressed alone did not interact with ICAM-1Fc or VCAM-1Fc (Fig. 2 B), showing that adhesion to ICAM-1Fc is mediated solely by the I domain in the fusion protein. The LFA-1 and Mac-1 I domain structures have recently been solved, and a key feature is a Mg2+/Mn2+ binding site, the MIDAS motif (15Lee J.-O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 16Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 17Qu A. Leahy D.J. Structure. 1996; 4: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), which suggests an important role for divalent cation in I domain interactions. However, although divalent cations are essential for adhesion of intact integrins, solid phase binding assays using isolated I domains have provided conflicting evidence for their requirement (23Tuckwell D. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we show that isolated LFA-1 I domain requires the metal ion Mg2+ for full activity (Fig. 3). Furthermore, binding to ICAM-1Fc is diminished by EDTA or Ca2+, while Mg2+ binding is enhanced when Ca2+ is chelated using EGTA. In the absence of Mg2+ or with Ca2+, a limited amount of binding is seen (Fig. 3). Therefore, the ligand binding behavior of the isolated I domain under different cation conditions resembles that of intact receptor, further validating the assay and suggesting that the I domain may dominate LFA-1 function. The GST protein serves as a control for all of the divalent cation conditions. Anti-LFA-1 (CD11a) mAbs, which map to epitopes in the I domain (14Randi A.M. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12395-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are able to interfere with adhesion between cell surface-expressed LFA-1 and ICAM-1. We tested the effect of several of these mAbs on binding of isolated I domain to ICAM-1Fc and found that the blocking pattern exactly reflected that observed for LFA-1 on T cells (14Randi A.M. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12395-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Landis R.C. McDowall A. Holness C.L.L. Littler A.J. Simmons D.L. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); mAbs 38, MEM 25, and MEM 30 blocked well, mAb F110.22 blocked to a lesser degree, and activating mAb MEM 83 and control mAbs were non-blocking (Fig. 4 A). This concordance in mAb blocking activity between T cell LFA-1 and isolated I domain, together with binding specificity and cation dependence, confirms the native function of the recombinant I domain. To locate the I domain binding site on ICAM-1, we first tested a panel of anti-ICAM-1 (CD54) mAbs that interfere with LFA-1 binding and map to distinct epitopes on the CFG face of domain 1 and to the top of domain 2 (20Berendt A.R. McDowall A. Craig A.G. Bates P.A. Sternberg M.J.E. Marsh K. Newbold C.I. Hogg N. Cell. 1992; 68: 71-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Four of the five mAbs tested had no effect on I domain/ICAM-1Fc binding compared with control isotype-matched mAbs (Fig. 4 B), which suggests that the I domain does not bind to ICAM-1 domain 1 at the sites recognized by them. The fifth mAb, RR1/1, which maps to the Gln-73 sequence on the G strand at the top of domain 1 (2Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), enhanced binding of I domain to ICAM-1Fc (Fig. 4 B). This was unexpected, as mAb RR1/1 is a good blocker of adhesion between ICAM-1 and cell surface LFA-1. A capture ELISA assay showed that there is no direct binding of I-GST to any ICAM-1 mAb tested (data not shown). As a further approach to identifying the I domain binding site on ICAM-1, the two ICAM-1Fc mutants E34A and Q73N were tested in the ELISA assay. The E34A mutant substantially blocked I domain binding (Fig. 5), showing for the first time that the I domain interacts with domain 1 of ICAM-1 and involves residue Glu-34. Unlike the E34A mutant, binding of I domain to the Q73N mutant resembled wt ICAM-1Fc (Fig. 5). This result, together with the enhanced binding shown with mAb RR1/1 (Fig. 4 B), which maps to Gln-73 on the G strand, suggests that this region of ICAM-1 influences binding of the I domain but does not directly interact with it. The presence or absence of divalent cation has been shown to result in little alteration to the structure of the LFA-1 I domain (17Qu A. Leahy D.J. Structure. 1996; 4: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It has therefore been suggested that, during activation, Mg2+ may be involved either in conformational change between integrin domains or binds directly to ligand. As demonstrated in this study, Mg2+ produces a marked increase in I domain binding, showing that it has a direct role in the function of the isolated I domain and suggesting involvement in ligand binding. If, as has been predicted (26Loftus J.C. Liddington R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Bergelson J.M. Hemler M.E. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 615-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the Glu-34 residue is involved directly in cation-dependent ligand binding, then the limited binding of I domain to the Glu-34 mutant ICAM-1Fc should be insensitive to divalent cation. We tested the effect of Mg2+ and EDTA on the level of I domain binding to the E34A mutant and found that it was equivalent (Fig. 6). In addition, EDTA-treated wt ICAM-1Fc binding was comparable to the level of G34A ICAM-1Fc binding in Mg2+, suggesting that the Glu-34 residue has an essential role in divalent cation-dependent binding. Addition of anti-LFA-1 blocking mAb 38 results in binding equivalent to the GST control, showing that the binding not blocked by EDTA is specific. This result is consistent with the interpretation that residue Glu-34 does interact with Mg2+ at the MIDAS site. The mutant Q73N ICAM-1Fc showed equivalent binding to wt ICAM-1Fc in Mg2+(Fig. 6) and was blocked similarly by EDTA (data not shown). An ELISA assay showing isolated LFA-1 I domain binding to ICAM-1 was characterized with the aim of identifying the residues of ICAM-1 that are critical for this interaction. The main findings of the study are that: 1) I domain binding to ICAM-1 is Mg2+-dependent and mirrors the cation-dependent behavior of cell surface LFA-1; 2) intact LFA-1 receptor binding is inhibited by ICAM-1 domain 1 mutations at Glu-34 and Gln-73, in confirmation of previous studies; 3) the I domain is sensitive to mutation of residue Glu-34 but not Gln-73; 4) anti-ICAM-1 mAb RR1/1, which maps to Gln-73, enhances binding of the I domain to ICAM-1; and 5) the limited binding of I domain to the Glu-34 mutant is cation-independent, which adds evidence to previous suggestions that this residue may form the point of ligand contact with the MIDAS motif in the I domain. The ELISA assay detecting LFA-1 I domain binding to ICAM-1 reflected several characteristics of the interaction of intact receptor with ligand. The binding was specific for ICAM-1, with no recognition of the closely related IgSF adhesion protein VCAM-1. Additionally, monoclonal antibodies previously mapped to the I domain (14Randi A.M. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12395-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and shown to block the interaction between intact LFA-1 and ICAM-1 by varying amounts (25Landis R.C. McDowall A. Holness C.L.L. Littler A.J. Simmons D.L. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) had a comparable blocking pattern in the isolated I domain assay. The divalent cation binding characteristics of the isolated I domain in our assay mirror the behavior of intact LFA-1 (1Dransfield I. Cabañas C. Craig A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), with Mg2+ promoting maximal binding to ICAM-1 and Ca2+ failing to support binding. This suggests that the I domain controls the divalent cation-dependent function of the native receptor. Although the majority of LFA-1 I domain binding is dependent upon the presence of Mg2+, there is a low level of binding in the assay, which occurs in the absence of divalent cation and is specific as it is blocked by anti-LFA-1 mAb. The specific binding of LFA-1 I domain with and without divalent cation supports both previous conflicting reports about divalent cation requirement of α2β1 I domain (23Tuckwell D. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The LFA-1 I domain structure solved in the presence of Mg2+ or absence of cation showed little difference in tertiary structure (17Qu A. Leahy D.J. Structure. 1996; 4: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and therefore does not exclude the possibility of low level cation-independent binding as observed here. In the intact LFA-1 receptor, this may not be possible due to insufficient binding strength or masking of the binding face between α and β subunits, which are believed to undergo conformational change during activation (13Hogg N. Landis R.C. Bates P.A. Stanley P. Randi A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 379-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,26Loftus J.C. Liddington R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A main objective of this study was to determine the regions of ligand ICAM-1 that are important for recognition by the LFA-1 I domain to understand how integrin and ligand interact. As the anti-I domain mAbs blocked similarly in ELISA and whole cell assays, anti-ICAM-1 mAbs were also tested. Monoclonal antibodies that interfere with ICAM-1 binding of cell surface-expressed LFA-1 (20Berendt A.R. McDowall A. Craig A.G. Bates P.A. Sternberg M.J.E. Marsh K. Newbold C.I. Hogg N. Cell. 1992; 68: 71-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) were unable to block the ELISA assay. The explanation for this may be that, in intact LFA-1, the anti-ICAM-1 mAbs block function by interfering with a binding site on ICAM-1 not involving the I domain or that they block sterically rather than directly. The domain 1 residues Glu-34 and Gln-73 of ICAM-1 have been shown to be essential for binding of intact LFA-1 receptor to ICAM-1 (2Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A.

However, the demonstration here that LFA-1 I domain binding is sensitive to Glu-34 mutated ICAM-1 is the first evidence that the LFA-1 I domain interacts with this region of ICAM-1 domain 1. Mutation of equivalent residues Glu-37 in ICAM-3 (7Sadhu S. Lipsky B. Erickson H.P. Hayflick J. Dick K.O. Gallatin W.M. Staunton D.E. Cell Adhes.

The I domain may be expected to interact with Glu-37 of ICAM-3, but VCAM-1 is the ligand of α4β1, an I domain-negative integrin. If residue Asp-40 in VCAM-1 has a similar function to Glu-34 in ICAM-1, then it must be recognized by a different integrin domain, potentially the β subunit I domain. In contrast, binding of I domain to the Gln-73 ICAM-1 mutant resembled wt ICAM-1. Since there is a definite requirement for Gln-73 not only for cell-surface LFA-1 but also for LFA-1 in cell-free systems (2Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 5Fisher K.L. Lu J. Riddle L. Kim K.J. Presta L.G. Bodary S.C. Mol. Biol.

Proteins. 1996; 26: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), this result implies that Gln-73 interacts with a region of LFA-1 other than the I domain either on the α or β subunit. However, the enhanced binding caused by anti-ICAM-1 mAb RR1/1, which maps to Gln-73 on the G strand, suggests that this region of ICAM-1 influences binding of the I domain. The mAb might mimic an allosteric alteration of ICAM-1 following LFA-1 binding or replace the cooperative binding of another LFA-1 domain by altering the orientation of the G strand to facilitate I domain binding. In ICAM-3, the comparable Gln-75 residue is also critical for intact LFA-1 binding and may have a similar role in I domain interaction. This residue is not conserved in VCAM-1. In the solved Mac-1 I domain crystal structure, Mg2+ bound to the MIDAS motif coordinated a glutamic acid (Glu) residue in an adjacent I domain (15Lee J.-O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). This was suggested to mimic the ligand bound state and led to the prediction that the function of critical acidic residues found in ligands might be to coordinate Mg2+ (26Loftus J.C. Liddington R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,27Bergelson J.M. Hemler M.E. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 615-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in this study, Mg2+ produces a marked increase in I domain binding, showing that it has a direct role in the function of the isolated I domain consistent with a critical role in ligand binding. However, Glu-34 mutated ICAM-1 shows limited binding, which is not enhanced by addition of Mg2+. The equivalence in level of cation-independent I domain binding to wt ICAM-1 in the presence of EDTA and the binding of Glu-34 mutant supports the suggestion that the Glu-34 residue has an essential role in cation-dependent binding. This result is consistent with the interpretation that residue Glu-34 interacts with Mg2+, but this issue will be finally solved only by co-crystallization of I domain with ICAM-1. The mutant Q73N ICAM-1 showed equivalent binding to wt ICAM-1 in Mg2+ (Fig. 4) and was blocked similarly by EDTA (data not shown). Recently, ICAM-1 domain 1 residues Lys-39, Met-64, Tyr-66, and Asn-68 have also been highlighted as important for binding of purified LFA-1 to ICAM-1 (5Fisher K.L. Lu J. Riddle L. Kim K.J. Presta L.G. Bodary S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 501-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, none of these residues has the appropriate characteristics for direct MIDAS coordination. Although there has been speculation that the I domain associates with domain 1 (27Bergelson J.M. Hemler M.E. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 615-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Graves B.J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), this report is the first direct demonstration of the interaction. The binding site includes the Glu-34 residue on the C strand, which appears to influence Mg2+-dependent binding. In the modeled structure of ICAM-1 (20Berendt A.R. McDowall A. Craig A.G. Bates P.A. Sternberg M.J.E. Marsh K. Newbold C.I. Hogg N. Cell. 1992; 68: 71-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and the solved ICAM-2 structure (29Casasnovas J.M. Springer T.A. Liu J. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), Glu-34 is central to a flat area, which may serve as the ligand binding face. The region surrounding the MIDAS motif, which is also flat, contains residues required for binding of ligand (30Huang C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), suggesting the I domain and ICAM-1 could interact with one another at several contact points. The enhancing activity of mAb RR1/1, and lack of effect of the Gln-73 mutant on isolated I domain binding, implies that the G strand region cooperatively or allosterically contributes to I domain binding possibly at the Glu-34 site. The LFA-1 binding interface with ICAM-1 is likely to be complex. Other regions of LFA-1 that might interact with Gln-73 as well as other areas of ICAM-1 are the I domain-like region of the β subunit (19Goodman T.G. Bajt M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23729-23736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and sequences within domain V/VI of the α subunit (18Stanley P. Bates P.A. Harvey J. Bennett R.I. Hogg N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1790-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In summary, by identifying the Glu-34 but not the Gln-73 region of ICAM-1 in specifically binding the LFA-1 I domain, the initial steps have been taken toward understanding how integrin and ligand recognize each other. We thank our colleagues Paul Bates, Alison McDowall, Joanna Porter, and Matthew Robinson for many helpful comments on the manuscript."

We have identified, in two independently selected TG-resistant hamster cell lines of different lineages, mutant forms of SERCA.

Several inhibitors of the SERCAs have been described, of which thapsigargin (TG) is the most potent and specific (1Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By inhibiting SERCA function, TG depletes intracellular Ca2+stores, resulting in inhibition of cell proliferation. However, high levels of resistance to TG inhibition of cell proliferation can be developed (2Gutheil J.C. Hart S.R. Belani C.P. Melera P.W. Hussain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7976-7981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hussain A. Garnett C. Klein M.G. Tsai-Wu J.J. Schneider M.F. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12140-12146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms that contribute to the increased production of SERCA protein become operative upon the selection of TG-resistant cells. 2A. K. Rishi, M. Yu, J.-J. Tsai-Wu, C. P. Belani, J. A. Fontana, D. L. Baker, M. Periasamy, and A. Hussain, submitted for publication. 2A. K. Rishi, M. Yu, J.-J. Tsai-Wu, C. P. Belani, J. A. Fontana, D. L. Baker, M. Periasamy, and A. Hussain, submitted for publication. In addition, resistance to TG can be associated with overexpression of the multidrug resistance transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp) (2Gutheil J.C. Hart S.R. Belani C.P. Melera P.W. Hussain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7976-7981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2Although increased expression of SERCA or Pgp may contribute to TG resistance, our previous studies suggest that a SERCA(s) that is directly resistant to TG inhibition can also be selected for during development of the TG-resistant phenotype (3Hussain A. Garnett C. Klein M.G. Tsai-Wu J.J. Schneider M.F. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12140-12146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To determine whether altered forms of SERCA do in fact occur during TG selection and potentially contribute to TG resistance, we have begun to study the SERCAs from the TG-resistant cells. Although TG affects SERCA function rather globally, the sites of interaction between TG and SERCA have not been clearly defined. Chimeric recombinations between SERCA1 and Na+,K+-ATPase demonstrate that TG does not bind within the catalytic domain (i.e. the large cytosolic loop) of the ATPase (5Sumbilla C. Lu L. Lewis D.E. Inesi G. Ishii T. Takeyasu K. Feng Y. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21185-21192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, studies suggest that binding to TG may occur within the M3 transmembrane domain of SERCA (6Norregaard A. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26598-26601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, our initial efforts have been to analyze the 5′ ends of SERCA, which encompass the M3 domain, from the TG-resistant cell lines. In this report, we demonstrate that substitutions at amino acid (aa) position 256 occur within the SERCAs obtained from two independently derived TG-resistant cell lines. The mutant ATPases contain either a Phe256 → Leu or a Phe256 → Ser change. Moreover, when either of these two specific mutations are introduced into wild-type (wt) SERCA1, both Ca2+ transport and ATP hydrolytic activities of the resulting ATPase become resistant to inhibition by TG. No mutations occur within the M3 domain (i.e. the putative TG binding site) of the TG-resistant cell derived SERCAs. This is the first demonstration of naturally occurring mutations within SERCA during development of the TG-resistant phenotype, and our results suggest that Phe256, which lies within the first cytosolic loop just upstream of the M3 domain, represents a “ hot spot” for mutations upon TG selection, and is potentially involved in TG-SERCA interactions. The Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line DC-3F has been described previously (7Biedler J.L. Riehn H. Cancer Res. 1970; 30: 1174-1184PubMed Google Scholar). The TG-resistant cell line DC-3F/TG was derived from DC-3F cells by stepwise selection in TG, with the final maintenance concentration being 2 μm TG (2Gutheil J.C. Hart S.R. Belani C.P. Melera P.W. Hussain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7976-7981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both DC-3F and DC-3F/TG cells were maintained in α-minimum essential media (Sigma) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Inc.) plus 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The Syrian hamster smooth muscle cell line DDT1-MF2 (8Smith R.G. Syms A.J. Norris J.S. J. Steroid Biochem. 1984; 20: 227-281Google Scholar) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 4% enriched calf serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Inc.) plus 50 μg/ml gentamicin. The DDT/TG 4μm cells were derived from DDT1-MF2 cells by a series of stepwise selections with TG, the final maintenance concentration of TG being 4 μm.2 Clonal sublines were derived by limiting dilution. Based on the published rat SERCA2a cDNA sequence (9Gunteski-Hamblin A.-M. Greeb J. Shull G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15032-15040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 5′ and 3′ degenerate primers, designated 2.1 and 2.2, respectively, were designed between nucleotide (nt) 1–18 and nt 976–992, respectively (Table I). Total RNA isolated from DC-3F cells was reverse-transcribed (RT) using oligo(dT)12–18 primer, the double-stranded cDNA amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers 2.1 and 2.2, and the resulting 992-bp PCR product cloned into pBluescript SK+. Nitrocellulose replica filters were screened as per Grunstein's method (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.E. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Based on these sequence data, hamster-specific 5′ forward primer (designated 2.3, corresponding to nt 104–121) and 3′ reverse primer (designated 2.4, corresponding to nt 936–953) (Table I) were used to RT-PCR amplify 850-bp 5′ end SERCA2 cDNA fragments from DC-3F/TG, DDT1-MF2, and DDT/TG 4μm cells. The PCR products were separately ligated into pBluescript SK+, several independent clones from each ligation were selected, and their sequence obtained by dideoxy sequencing using T7 and T3 primers.Table IDifferent SERCA2-specific primers used for cloning and ASO-PCR assysPrimersPosition1-aThe position of the various primers are relative to the translation start site, which is taken as +1.OrientationSequences (5′ → 3′)Rat 2.11–18SenseCGCGGATCCATGGARAAYGCNCAYACRat 2.2976–992AntisenseCGCGGATCCGCRTTYTTYTTNCCATHamster 2.3104–121SenseCGCGGATCCGATGGGGCTCCAACGAATHamster 2.4936–953AntisenseCGCGGATCCAGGTGGTGATGACAGCAHamster 2.16766–782AntisenseGAAAGCTGCTCCCCAAAHamster 2.17766–782AntisenseGAAAGCTGCTCCCCAAGHamster 2.27767–783AntisenseGGAAAGTTGCTCCCCAAHamster 2.28767–783AntisenseGGAAAGTTGCTCCCCAG1-a The position of the various primers are relative to the translation start site, which is taken as +1. Open table in a new tab Two antisense primers (designated 2.16 and 2.17) that are complementary to the DC-3F SERCA2 cDNA sequence between nt 766 and 782 were designed. Primers 2.16 and 2.17 are identical except at nt position 766 (Table I). Primer 2.16 is complementary to wt SERCA2 cDNA encoding Phe256, while primer 2.17 is complementary to mutant SERCA2 cDNA encoding Leu256. Each antisense primer (2.16 or 2.17) was used in combination with the sense primer 2.3 (Table I) to amplify SERCA2 cDNA using RT-PCR from DC-3F or DC-3F/TG cells (12Rishi A. Hatzis D. McAlmon K. Floros J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L566-L573PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR parameters consisted of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, extension at 72 °C for 1.5 min for 40 cycles. Two other 17-mer primers (2.27 and 2.28) (Table I) that are complementary to the DDT1-MF2 SERCA2 cDNA sequence between nt 767 and 783, were used in combination with primer 2.3, to RT-PCR amplify SERCA2 from DDT1-MF2 and DDT/TG 4μm cells under the above conditions.

With appropriately designed primers, 720-bp PCR products, containing the desired mutations within the body of the amplified products as well as appropriate restriction site overhangs, were obtained using SERCA1 cDNA template. The PCR products were exchanged with the corresponding fragments from the wt SERCA1 cDNA, and sequenced to ensure fidelity of the PCR amplification step. The resulting pCDL-SRα296 plasmids, containing the wt or mutant SERCA cDNAs, were transfected as described previously (5Sumbilla C. Lu L. Lewis D.E. Inesi G. Ishii T. Takeyasu K. Feng Y.

Transient transfection into monkey kidney COS1 cells was carried out using the DEAE-dextran method as detailed previously (5Sumbilla C. Lu L. Lewis D.E. Inesi G. Ishii T. Takeyasu K. Feng Y.

Preparation of microsomes from the transfected cells was as described by Zhanget al. (15Zhang Z. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Summers S. Klein M.G. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16283-16290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody 9E10 to the c-myc epitope (16Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar) was used to detect SERCA1 expression in the transfected COS1 cells via Western blotting. Ca2+ transport activity of the microsomal fractions was determined as described previously (3Hussain A. Garnett C. Klein M.G. Tsai-Wu J.J. Schneider M.F. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12140-12146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured by the amount of Pi released upon the addition of ATP to the microsomal fractions (15Zhang Z. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Summers S. Klein M.G. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16283-16290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinsch P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). Both Ca2+ transport and ATPase activities were normalized by the amount of expressed SERCA1 protein in the microsomal fractions obtained by Western blotting. Although cDNAs encoding the different isoforms of SERCA have been cloned from many species, the hamster SERCAs have yet to be cloned. We therefore used 5′ and 3′ degenerate oligonucleotide primers, corresponding to the published rat SERCA2a cDNA sequence, to clone a ∼1-kilobase pair 5′ end SERCA2 cDNA from Chinese hamster DC-3F cells. Six different clones, obtained from two independent RT-PCR reactions, have been sequenced (data not shown). Based on these sequence data, hamster-specific 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotide primers were used to clone 850-bp 5′ end cDNA fragments of SERCA2 from the wt DDT1-MF2 cells, as well as the TG-resistant DC-3F/TG and DDT/TG 4μmcells. To obtain sequence information of the translation start site region of hamster SERCA2, two additional primers were used to clone a 440-bp overlapping cDNA fragment encompassing the SERCA translation start site from the hamster cells. In the sequenced 5′ end of the molecule, the hamster and rat SERCA2 are identical at the protein level, although several nt changes between the two are noted. Nucleotide changes in SERCA are also noted to occur among different strains within the same species (i.e. between DC-3F and DDT1-MF2 SERCA). Sequencing several independent clones from DC-3F/TG cells (which were obtained via separate RT-PCR reactions) reveals that the sequences of the clones are identical to that of wt DC-3F cells except at nt 766 (Table II). A T → C change at nt 766 occurs in five out of the eight clones, which predicts for a Phe256 → Leu change at the protein level. Since the clones were obtained from separate RT-PCR reactions, it is unlikely that this change represents a PCR artifact (see also below). That some clones have the wt phenotype and others the mutant suggests that the DC-3F/TG cell lines might represent a mixed population of cells, with some cells expressing the wt and others the mutant SERCA. The possibility also exists that the resistant cells represent a homogeneous population, with the SERCA allele being heterozygous with respect to nt 766 (i.e. aa 256). This is suggested by the fact that in clonally derived DC-3F/TG cell lines, both wt and mutant SERCA are expressed (see below).Table IIResults of sequencing the 5′ ends of the SERCA2 clones from wild-type and TG-resistant hamster cellsCell lineNo. of clonesWild-type TTT (Phe256)Mutant CTT (Leu256)Mutant TCT (Ser256)DC-3F (wild-type)66DC-3F/TG (resistant)835DDT1-MF2 (wild-type)33DDT/TG 4μm (resistant)1275 Open table in a new tab With respect to the DDT/TG 4μm cell line, 12 independent SERCA clones, obtained from three separate RT-PCR reactions, have been sequenced. Five of these clones have a T → C change at nt 767 (instead of at nt 766), predicting for a Phe256 → Ser mutation (Table II). Since the DDT/TG 4μm cell line represents a clonal population, the presence of both wt and mutant clones suggests that, similar to DC-3F/TG cells, the SERCA allele is heterozygous in DDT/TG 4μm cells with respect to nt 767. The M3 domain, which is the putative TG binding site, lies between nt 781 and 843 (i.e. from aa 261 to aa 283). It should be pointed out that in neither of the above TG-resistant cell lines is a mutation observed within this region, i.e. between nt 781 and 843 (data not shown). To further clarify the observed changes at nt 766 and 767, ASO-based PCR assays were performed. Shown in Fig. 1 A are the wt and mutant hamster SERCA2 sequence between nt positions 766 and 782. Also shown in parentheses are the reverse primers 2.16 and 2.17 that were used in the PCR assay. Note the T → C change at nt 766 between the wt and mutant sequence, which are otherwise identical. The 2.16 and 2.17 reverse primers are identical except for the single nt change at their 3′ ends, which distinguishes primer 2.16 from primer 2.17 (Fig. 1 A, Table I). Since DC-3F cells express only wt SERCA, the primer pair 2.3 and 2.16 (2.3 is the forward primer) (Table I) should amplify, under appropriate conditions of annealing and extension, a 679-bp product from reverse-transcribed DC-3F RNA (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). On the other hand, the primer pair 2.3 and 2.17 amplifies only mutant SERCA2, and hence this pair does not give rise to any PCR product under similar conditions when reverse-transcribed DC-3F RNA is used as template (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). In contrast, DC-3F/TG cells express both wt and mutant SERCA. Hence, either primer pair (i.e. 2.3 and 2.16 for wt, or 2.3 and 2.17 for mutant) should amplify a 679-bp fragment when RNA from DC-3F/TG cells is used as template (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5 and 6). The DC-3F/TG cell line shown in Fig. 1 B represents a mass population. Three independent clonal sublines have been derived from the DC-3F/TG mass population by limiting dilution. Analysis of the clonal lines demonstrates that in each cell line both wt and mutant SERCA are expressed (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1 and 2, clone 1; lanes 3 and 4, clone 2;lanes 5 and 6, clone 3; lanes 7 and 8, wt DC-3F). Since each clonal population was presumably derived from a single cell, the above data are consistent with the SERCA allele being heterozygous with respect to the Phe256 → Leu mutation in the DC-3F/TG cells. Fig. 2 shows the results of a typical ASO-based PCR assay performed on DDT/TG 4μm cells. In Fig. 2 A are shown the two antisense primers 2.27 and 2.28, which are identical to each other except at nt 767. Under appropriate conditions of annealing, primer 2.27 hybridizes to the complementary DNA strand containing T at nt 767 (which predicts for Phe256), while primer 2.28 hybridizes to the complementary strand containing C at nt 767 (which predicts for Ser256). That the primer pair 2.3 and 2.27 amplifies a 680-bp PCR product from both DDT1-MF2 cells (Fig. 2 B, lane 8) and DDT/TG 4μm cells (Fig. 2 B, lane 5) demonstrates that the wt Phe256 SERCA exists in both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells. The primer pair 2.3 and 2.28 amplifies a 680-bp fragment from DDT/TG 4μm cells (Fig. 2 B, lane 6) but not from wt DDT1-MF2cells (Fig. 2 B, lane 9). These data confirm and extend the initial sequencing data with respect to the heterozygous Phe256 → Ser change in DDT/TG 4μm cells. The specificity of the above primers is demonstrated by the data in Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and 3. Lane 2 shows the presence of a 679-bp fragment when reverse-transcribed RNA from DDT/TG 4μm cells is amplified with the primer pair 2.3 plus 2.16. Primer 2.16 is identical to primer 2.27, except the former extends from nt 766 to 782, while the latter extends from 767 to 783. Importantly, the primer pair 2.3 plus 2.17 (which recognizes Leu256; Fig. 1) fails to amplify any PCR product from DDT/TG 4μm cells (Fig. 2 B, lane 3), thus confirming the ability of the above primers in recognizing only specific nt changes. To determine whether the observed mutations do in fact contribute to TG resistance, the appropriate substitutions within codon 256 have been introduced by PCR-based in vitro mutagenesis in a wild-type full-length avian SERCA1-encoding cDNA (11Karin N.J. Kaprielian Z. Fambrough D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1978-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The resulting SERCA-containing expression plasmids have been transfected into COS1 cells. Western blot analysis demonstrates that introduction of the above mutations at aa 256 do not affect the expression of the transfected mutant SERCAs, when compared with transfected wt SERCA, in COS1 cells (Fig. 3). Furthermore, measurement of Ca2+ transport and ATPase activities of the respective microsomal fractions demonstrate that neither the Phe256→ Leu nor the Phe256 → Ser change substantially alters either the Ca2+ transport function or the ATPase activity of the mutants when compared with wt SERCA (Table III).Table IIICa2+ uptake and ATPase activities of microsomes obtained from SERCA1-transfected COS1 cellsSERCAATPase activity (mean ± S.E.)Ca2+ uptake (mean ± S.E.)nmol/min/mgnmol/min/mgWild-type93.16 ± 2.003-aThe data were obtained by two separate experiments and normalized with respect to the expression of SERCA in each microsomal preparation.67.0 ± 8.69Leu25693.14 ± 15.9169.4 ± 14.2Ser256113.16 ± 0.9776.8 ± 16.43-a The data were obtained by two separate experiments and normalized with respect to the expression of SERCA in each microsomal preparation. Open table in a new tab Upon measuring Ca2+ transport activity as a function of TG concentration, each aa substitution renders COS1 microsomal fraction45Ca2+ uptake 4-fold resistant to inhibition by TG (Fig. 4). Moreover, each mutation results in a 5-fold increase in resistance to TG in terms of hydrolysis of ATP by the mutant SERCA (Fig. 5).Figure 5Thapsigargin inhibition of Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity by microsomal fractions obtained from SERCA1-transfected COS1 cells. ATPase activities in the microsomal fractions obtained from wt (•), Leu256 (○), and Ser256 (□) transfected COS1 cells were measured by determination of Pi in the presence or absence of TG as described by Zhang et al. (14Hussain A. Lewis D.E. Sumbilla C. Lai L. Melera P.W. Inesi G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-dependent activity was calculated by subtracting the Ca2+-independent ATPase activity from the total ATPase activities. ATPase activities are expressed relative to the activity obtained in the absence of TG. Each point represents the average of two independent measurements, and standard errors (S.E.) are indicated as bars.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It is of note that, although the above mutations lead to essentially equivalent levels of resistance to TG with respect to both Ca2+ transport (Fig. 4) and ATP hydrolytic activities (Fig. 5), the absolute concentrations of TG required to inhibit Ca2+ transport function appear to be somewhat lower than that required to inhibit the ATPase activity of both wt and mutant SERCAs (compare Figs. 4 and 5). The apparent discrepancy in the absolute concentrations of TG between Figs. 4 and 5 is in part due to the very nature of the two assays, i.e. Ca2+transport function is determined by the amount of45Ca2+ retained by microsomal fractions, while ATPase function is assessed spectrophotometrically. Nevertheless, these data clearly demonstrate that certain mutations at aa 256 can modify SERCA's transport and catalytic properties with respect to the enzyme's response to its specific inhibitor TG. In this report, we identified mutant forms of SERCA that can confer resistance to TG inhibition. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of naturally occurring mutations within SERCA that occur upon long term exposure of mammalian cells to SERCA's highly specific inhibitor TG. Although wt cells in culture are exquisitely sensitive to SERCA pump inhibition, high levels of resistance to TG can be developed by long term selection so that the selected cells continue to proliferate in TG (2Gutheil J.C. Hart S.R. Belani C.P. Melera P.W. Hussain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7976-7981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hussain A. Garnett C. Klein M.G. Tsai-Wu J.J. Schneider M.F. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12140-12146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).2 Previously, we reported several adaptive changes that the TG-selected cells employ to maintain growth in TG (2Gutheil J.C. Hart S.R. Belani C.P. Melera P.W. Hussain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7976-7981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hussain A. Garnett C. Klein M.G. Tsai-Wu J.J. Schneider M.F. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12140-12146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).2 Among these is overexpression of the multi-drug resistance transporter Pgp (2Gutheil J.C. Hart S.R. Belani C.P. Melera P.W. Hussain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7976-7981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as overproduction of SERCA protein by a multiplicity of mechanisms including gene amplification, transcriptional up-regulation, and post-transcriptional alterations.2 Previous in situ studies, as well as analysis of Ca2+ transport activity following isolation of microsomal fractions from TG-resistant cells, suggested qualitative changes that directly contribute to TG resistance might also occur within these ATPase (3Hussain A. Garnett C. Klein M.G. Tsai-Wu J.J. Schneider M.F. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12140-12146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our present studies clearly demonstrate that aa 256 is susceptible to specific mutations (Table II, Figs. 1 and 2). That cell lines of two different lineages, selected independently for TG resistance, give rise to two different mutations at the same location suggests that this aa is particularly susceptible to mutations. The data also suggest that aa 256 might be closely linked with TG-SERCA interactions. Since the M3 domain is the putative TG binding site, our initial efforts have been to analyze regions of SERCA encompassing this domain. If any mutations occur within SERCA in the TG-selected cells, they would be expected to occur within the TG binding pocket. Such mutations could potentially alter SERCA's affinity for TG, thus rendering the ATPase resistant to inhibition by TG. For instance, antifolates like methotrexate (MTX) inhibit dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (18Melera P.W. Biedler J.L. Seminars in Cancer Biology. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1991: 245-255Google Scholar). However, specific mutations in DHFR (e.g. Leu 22→ Phe or Leu 22 → Arg) within the binding pocket of MTX can alter MTX's affinity for DHFR, resulting in a MTX-resistant phenotype (19Yu M. Melera P.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 6031-6035PubMed Google Scholar, 20Simonsen C.C. Levinson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2495-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Interestingly, no mutations in the TG-resistant cell lines have been found within the M3 domain upon natural drug selection (data not shown). However, Phe256, which is only 4 aa upstream from where the M3 domain begins (4Inesi G. Kirtley M.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 271-283PubMed Google Scholar), is mutable under our conditions with drug selection. Although isoform-specific changes distinguish the different isoforms of SERCA within and across species, at the protein level and with respect to the overall topology, the various SERCAs have a high degree of homology to each other. The M3 domain is highly conserved, but not identical, between SERCA1 and SERCA2 (4Inesi G. Kirtley M.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 271-283PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the 14 aa within the first cytosolic loop that are immediately upstream of the M3 domain (i.e. aa 247–260) are identical between SERCA1 and SERCA2 across diverse species (4Inesi G. Kirtley M.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 271-283PubMed Google Scholar), and are also similar to but not identical with the corresponding region in SERCA3 (4Inesi G. Kirtley M.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 271-283PubMed Google Scholar). Although our initial observations in terms of mutations at aa 256 are with hamster SERCA2, the fact that introduction of the observed mutations in a different isoform from a different species (i.e. avian SERCA1) renders the resulting mutant enzymes resistant to TG (Figs. 4 and 5) suggests that the aa 256 position is particularly important in TG-SERCA interactions. Interestingly, we have only observed heterozygous changes at aa 256 in the TG-resistant cells (Figs. 1 and 2). Although no mutations are observed within the actual M3 domain in our resistant cell lines, previous studies have suggested that this region is involved in TG-SERCA interactions (5Sumbilla C. Lu L. Lewis D.E. Inesi G. Ishii T. Takeyasu K. Feng Y. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21185-21192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Norregaard A. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26598-26601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the relative resistance to TG by the documented mutations at aa 256 is only 4–5-fold (Fig. 4), we cannot rule out the possibility that additional qualitative changes within other regions of SERCA could also occur, and potentially contribute to the overall TG resistance phenotype. In summary, our studies show that the SERCAs exhibit a variety of responses, including point mutations, that enable cells to survive in the presence of their highly selective and potent inhibitor TG. Thus, the SERCAs follow the same paradigm exhibited by enzymes like DHFR that are subjected to selective pressures by their specific inhibitors such as the antifolates.

An understanding of how cells communicate their contact with one another is critical for determining how cancers develop and spread. Because the molecular details of how fibroblasts communicate density changes are unclear, we examined cell density itself as a source of signaling events rather than examine specific receptors. A technique was developed to measure tyrosine phosphorylation acutely as a function of cell density. The tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins was found to be modified in response to cell density. Three of these proteins were identified as Src, paxillin, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), all of which show an increase in their tyrosine phosphate levels with increasing density. All of these proteins are found in focal adhesions, and both FAK and paxillin are believed to be localized exclusively in focal adhesions. Thus, changing cell density alters tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion components. The growth of normal cells is arrested at saturating cell density in a process termed contact inhibition.

Thus, changing cell density alters tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion components. Cells need to sense their environment to make decisions. Environmental signals are sensed by receptors that bind ligands such as growth factors, extracellular matrix, or cell surface molecules on adjacent cells. These receptors in turn activate signaling pathways, which communicate the state of the environment to the nucleus so that decisions on growth, differentiation, motility, etc. can be made. The importance of these pathways is made evident by the hallmarks of transformation: loss of requirements for growth factors, extracellular matrix (ECM), 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation buffer; TBST, Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20. and contact inhibition. Signals from the environment can be positive or negative for growth. The study of positive signals such as growth factors has led to a general model where activation of the receptor by the ligand leads to autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues of the receptor. These phosphorylated residues serve as substrates to assemble an active signaling complex. The immediate result of the activation of these receptor-coupled enzymes is the activation of kinase cascades, which allow the amplification of the signal through the pathway. In each case, the end result of the kinase cascade is modified transcription of select genes in the nucleus. The extracellular matrix also serves as a positive signal for growth. The best characterized extracellular matrix receptors are integrins. Integrins are also important in cell migration and differentiation. Contact of fibroblasts with ECM proteins leads to the activation of multiple signaling pathways, including the activation of protein-tyrosine kinases (1Guan J.L. Trevithick J.E. Hynes R.O. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 951-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 2Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). In fact, many different integrins can regulate protein-tyrosine kinases (2Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, the interaction of ECM and integrins results in the increased activity of the tyrosine kinase pp125 FAK (3Guan J.L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Increased FAK activity results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and the recruitment of signaling proteins such as Src and paxillin to FAK. Although signals in response to growth factors and extracellular matrix have long been studied, the negative growth signals resulting from cell contact have received attention only more recently. Most of what is known about the signaling resulting form cell-cell contact comes from the study of epithelial cells. Epithelial cells have transmembrane receptors, cadherins, which are important for communicating signals generated at sites of cell-cell contact. The current model suggests that cadherins on one cell can interact with those on another cell and could serve as a molecular probe for cell density. Catenins form a complex with cytoplasmic tail of cadherins (4Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 5Gumbiner B.M. McCrea P.D. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1993; 17: 155-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which can be phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases including MET, epidermal growth factor receptor, and Src (6Shibamoto S. Hayakawa M. Takeuchi K. Hori T. Oku N. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. Takeichi M. Ito F. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 1: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 7Kemler R. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Evidence that this signaling pathway plays a critical role in contact inhibition comes from studies of theDrosophila DLG protein. The DLG protein is found at cell-cell contacts and is homologous to ZO-1 and ZO-2 found in tight junctions (8Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2948) Google Scholar). Mutations in the DLG protein result in overgrowth of the imaginal disc cells, indicating a role in tissue growth control and signal transduction (9Bryant P.J. Watson K.L. Justice R.W. Woods D.F. Development. 1993; (Suppl.): 239-249Google Scholar). Although fibroblasts also exhibit contact inhibition, much less is known about the molecular signaling involved. The complex signaling pathways involved in both positive and negative growth signals rely, in part, on tyrosine phosphorylation. Because of the critical role phosphorylation plays in communicating aspects of the cell's environment, we examined whether cell density in culture could affect tyrosine phosphorylation. Because it is unclear how fibroblasts communicate density changes, we examined cell density itself as a source of signaling events rather than examining specific receptors and their downstream tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. By plating cells at increasing densities, we could manipulate the amount of cell-cell contact and observe the phosphotyrosine profiles of cells plated at increasing densities. Using this approach, we have identified several proteins for which phosphorylation state is modified by cell density as a method to identify the phosphorylated proteins responsible for signaling cell contact. Here, we begin the identification and initial molecular characterization of some of the proteins for which phosphorylation changes in response to plating densities. Balb 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. Cells were grown to confluence. Confluent cells were trypsinized and replated in fresh medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum) at 0.5, 1, 3, or 5 × 106 cells/10-cm plastic tissue culture dish. Pre or P lanes on figures represent samples from confluent cells before trypsinization and replating. These cells have been treated with fresh medium to be consistent with the treatment of the replated cells. Cells were allowed to attach to the dish for 2.5 h. Gradual confluence studies were done by plating Balb 3T3 cells at 10% confluence and harvesting when cells were at different levels of confluence. Cell medium was changed at least 24 h before harvest to avoid serum effects. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to remove medium. Cells were lysed at 0 °C on the plate with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 137 mmNaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 unit/μl aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF). Insoluble material was removed by a 3-min spin at 12,000 × g. The Nonidet P-40-soluble fraction was used for Western blots and immunoprecipitations. For the Src Western blot, the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction was re-extracted with RIPA (50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), creating the Nonidet P-40-insoluble/RIPA-soluble fraction. Equal microgram amounts of each lysate (generally about 25 μg) were separated by discontinuous SDS-PAGE. Transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose was accomplished by electrotransfer in transfer buffer (39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris, 0.37% SDS) at 400 mA for 4 h at 4 °C. Nitrocellulose was blocked by 5% powdered milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). Primary antibodies were diluted in 1 × TBST and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies against FAK and paxillin were obtained form Transduction Laboratories and used according to the manufacturer. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) and anti-FAK antibody for immunoprecipitation were from UBI. Detection of Src was through anti-Src 327 antibody provided by Dr. Brugge, Harvard Medical School, and was diluted to 1 μg/ml. Blots in which Src was to be detected contained 100 μg of lysate. Secondary antibodies were from Amersham Life Science and were diluted 1:5000. Proteins were detected using Amersham's ECL kit for Westerns. ECL was performed as suggested by the manufacturer. Precipitation of paxillin was accomplished by mixing 120 μg of lysate with 4 μg of anti-paxillin (Transduction Laboratories). Immunocomplexes were collected by the addition of protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Washed complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose blots as described above. Nitrocellulose blots were first probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10). Secondary antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase were diluted to 1:5000 (Promega). Tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin was detected and quantitated by fluorescence emission using Attophos substrate (JBL Scientific) and a FluorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The blot was stripped of antibody and reprobed with anti-paxillin antibody (Transduction Laboratories) in the same manner. Using the numbers generated by the FluorImager, a -fold increase in tyrosine phosphate level of paxillin and a -fold increase in paxillin protein level were calculated. The precipitation of paxillin or tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was accomplished by mixing 200 μg of lysate with either 4 μg of anti-paxillin (Transduction Laboratories) or 60 μg of 4G10. Immunocomplexes were collected by the addition of protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia). Immunoprecipitations were washed twice with 0.5 m LiCl, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8, and once with phosphate-buffered saline. Immunoprecipitations in Fig. 3were accomplished by mixing 240 μg of lysate with 16.5 μg of 4G10 or 4.5 μg of anti-FAK monoclonal antibody (UBI). Complexes were precipitated by the addition of anti-mouse Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. Src was immunoprecipitated from 650 μg of lysate by the addition of 3.5 μg of 327 Src antibody and protein A-Sepharose. The washes and kinase assay were performed as described (10Rusanescu G. Qi H. Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Halegoua S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1415-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Paxillin immunoprecipitates were incubated with λ phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmMnCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) with or without 600 units of λ phosphatase for 30 min at 30 °C. To gain insights into the signaling pathway used by fibroblasts to communicate cell-cell contact, we used a method in which confluent cells were trypsinized and replated at various densities, thus providing a method to control the amount of contact the cells have with each other. At the lowest density (0.5 × 106cells/10-cm dish), cells exhibit little contact with other cells. At the highest density (5 × 106 cells/10-cm dish), each cell was in contact with several neighbors. Intermediate densities of 1 and 3 × 106 cells/10-cm dish yielded levels of contact consistent with their densities. Cells were allowed to interact for a fixed time (2.5 h) before they were harvested. This method reduces the number of variables such as medium replacement, which are necessary in experiments where cells grow together over several days, and allows for the detection of transient signals which could be lost over time. Because tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins have been shown to be important in many cell signaling pathways, we evaluated the phosphotyrosine pattern of the lysates obtained from cells in which the level of cell-cell contact was manipulated as a means to understand the molecular consequences of contact. Using this method, we have found differences in the phosphotyrosine pattern between lysates harvested from cells in which contact was minimal compared with cells that contacted many neighbors. Fig. 1 shows a typical phosphotyrosine pattern obtained from lysates prepared at 2.5 h after replating cells at increasing densities. The pattern can be divided into three categories: bands in which the phosphotyrosine signal increases with cell density, bands in which the phosphotyrosine signal seems to decrease with increasing cell density, and bands that do not respond to changes in cell density. Proteins of 120, 62, 45, and 20–30 kDa have increased phosphotyrosine levels in response to higher cell density. Other proteins such as a 68- and 58-kDa protein seem to have levels of phosphotyrosine that decrease with increasing cell density. Still other proteins do not appear to have changes in their phosphotyrosine content as a result of increased plating density (92 kDa). By comparing the molecular weight of the unknown protein to the molecular weights of known tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, a list of candidates was generated. Antibodies against the candidates were obtained to confirm or refute the tentative assignment. In this manner, we have identified three of the bands as paxillin, pp60c-src, and FAK. Because we had observed changes in tyrosine phosphorylation as a function of cell density, it was reasonable to speculate that tyrosine kinases might be activated. Kinases known to be modulated by cell-cell and cell substrate contacts include pp60c-src and FAK (11De Nichilo M.O. Yamada K.M. J. Biol.

As one of the bands that increased with density in the anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) blot was about 60 kDa and aligned when the blot was reprobed with anti-Src antibodies, we examined the effects that different densities had on the activity and distribution of the tyrosine kinase pp60c-src. Several density-dependent effects were observed. First, replating cells at higher densities shifted pp60c-src to a higher apparent molecular weight (Fig. 2). Lysates from confluent cells, before replating, show a doublet when probed with antibodies against pp60c-src. Both bands of the doublet are of equal intensity. The Src antibody used in these experiments is directed to the SH3 domain of Src and recognizes c-Src as well as v-Src and has not been reported to show a preference for different forms. When cells were replated at low densities, Src remained as a doublet, but cells replated at high densities displayed mainly the upper band with only traces of the lower band (Fig. 2, compare the 0.5 lane to5 lane of Nonidet P-40-soluble fraction). Second, only the slower migrating form was found in the Nonidet P-40-insoluble/RIPA-soluble fraction, and this form increased in abundance as cells were plated at increasing densities (Fig. 2, compare the 0.5 lane to 5 lane of Nonidet P-40-insoluble/RIPA-soluble fraction). Western blots on this fraction also indicate that the level of Src was high just before replating. Third, pp60c-src kinase activity increases with increasing cell density (data not shown). To determine if pp60c-src had increased kinase activity at higher densities, pp60c-src autokinase assays were done on the Nonidet P-40-soluble fractions. These results revealed that confluent cells and those plated at low density have low levels of kinase activity, whereas cells plated at high densities have high activity. In summary, when cells are replated, the amount of the slower migrating form as well as pp60c-src's kinase activity increase with increasing density. The anti-phosphotyrosine blot (Fig. 1) showed that, after 2.5 h of contact, a protein of about 120 kDa increased its level of tyrosine phosphorylation in density-dependent manner. This protein has increased tyrosine phosphorylation in both experiments in which cells grew together gradually and experiments in which wortmannin was used to inhibit spreading. Phosphorylation of this protein in response to density can be observed as early as 1 h (data not shown). This protein has been tentatively identified as focal adhesion kinase (pp125 FAK). This assignment is based on three facts. First, FAK is known to be one of the main tyrosine-phosphorylated bands in adherent fibroblasts. Second, blots probed with anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10), stripped of the antibody, and reprobed with a FAK antibody display a band at exactly the same location (data not shown). Third, immunoprecipitations with anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) or FAK antibodies displayed a band of 125 kDa when probed with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Fig. 3). Caution should be used in evaluating the levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK in the immunoprecipitation because the precipitating antibody does show different immunoaffinity for modified forms of FAK. The protein level of FAK does not change appreciably with changing densities (data not shown). Anti-phosphotyrosine blots of total lysates show a band at about 68 kDa (paxillin), which became less intense as cell density increased. Upon further study, it became clear that the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin actually increased with cell density. This fact was masked because paxillin undergoes heterogeneous modifications at higher cell density causing the phosphotyrosine signal to become diffuse. Upon review of the original anti-phosphotyrosine blots, one can see a 68-kDa band shifting into smear at that molecular weight. This only became clear after immunoprecipitations with 4G10 and anti-paxillin antibodies. Fig. 4 A shows an immunoprecipitation with anti-paxillin antibody followed by a Western to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. At low density replating, most of the tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin is in a single band with a light diffuse band above it, corresponding to other phosphorylated forms. When cells are replated at the highest density, the bottom band is missing and it has been replaced by a much more intense smear above it. When the bottom band and the smear are taken as a whole, the overall phosphotyrosine signal increases as density increases. The reciprocal immunoprecipitation confirms this finding. In Fig. 4 B, lysates were precipitated by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) and then probed with anti-paxillin antibodies. At low density replating, the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin is very low, as shown by the low levels recovered by precipitation with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Fig. 4 B). When cells are replated at high density, the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin recovered in a 4G10 immunoprecipitation is much higher (Fig. 4 B). These experiments clearly show that the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin increases with increased density; however, Western blots indicated that the amount of paxillin also increases with cell density (see below). To determine if the amount of phosphotyrosine per paxillin molecule was increasing or whether the increase in the phosphotyrosine signal was solely caused by the increase in protein levels, a quantitative Western was performed. The quantitative Western demonstrated that the level of tyrosine phosphate per molecule of paxillin increased more than 3-fold from the lowest to the highest density. In short, at high density replating, there are more paxillin molecules and they contain more tyrosine phosphate than the paxillin from cells replated at low density. Western blot analysis of total cell lysates with paxillin antibodies showed that, at lower densities, the paxillin migrated slower than paxillin from high density replating (Fig. 5). Tyrosine phosphorylation cannot explain this result, inasmuch as paxillin is less phosphorylated on tyrosine at low densities. One explanation was that at low density plating cells have high levels of Ser/Thr phosphate, which is not present when cells are plated at high density. Confluent cells have the faster migrating form of paxillin (Fig. 5), which is converted to a much slower form if cells are replated so they have little cell-cell contact. To confirm that these shifts were due to Ser/Thr phosphorylations and not other forms of modification, phosphatase treatments were done. Extracts were either treated or untreated with λ protein phosphatase. Treatment collapsed higher migrating species, as well as the slower migrating species, to a faster migrating doublet (Fig. 6). Although the λ phosphatase experiment indicates that the shifts are caused by phosphates, the data are consistent with the induction of a Ser/Thr kinase at low cell density or with the activation of a Ser/Thr phosphatase at high density.Figure 6Phosphatase treatment of paxillin.Immunoprecipitations of paxillin from each density were either untreated or treated with λ protein phosphatase.

P, confluent monolayer before replating.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To learn more about how paxillin behaves when cells are plated at different densities, lysates from the different densities were examined for their levels of paxillin by Western blot. The level of paxillin is high in confluent cells just before trypsinization and replating (Fig. 5). The amount of paxillin drops dramatically in cells replated at low density but remains high in cells plated at high density (Fig. 5). The loss of paxillin at low density replating is not caused by the movement of paxillin to a Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction because addition of RIPA to the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction showed that Nonidet P-40 had extracted all the paxillin at each density examined (data not shown). To determine if the change in paxillin levels was the result of breakdown or increased synthesis, an [35S]methionine pulse-chase experiment was done (data not shown). Cells were radiolabeled before replating at the various densities, and lysates were harvested 2.5 h later. At low density, both the35S signal as well as the signal generated by a Western blot were low; however, when cells were replated at high density, the35S signal as well as the signal generated by a Western blot remained high. This result suggests that the change in paxillin levels is caused by breakdown at low density replating rather than increased synthesis at high density replating. Next, we examined if the changes in paxillin levels and Ser/Thr phosphorylation could be detected at time points earlier than 2.5 h. At 1 h after plating, cells exhibited the paxillin shifting seen at the 2.5-h time point but did not exhibit as dramatic a level change as that seen at the longer time point (Fig. 7). The 1-h time point most likely represents the early phase of the paxillin turnover for several reasons. First, the paxillin levels at the lower cell densities are lower than the levels in the higher density cells indicating the beginnings of the turnover. Second, several smaller fragments are detected by the paxillin antibody in the low density lysates, suggesting that these may be breakdown products generated by the paxillin turnover. The changes in tyrosine phosphate seen at low cell density might in theory be due to cell spreading on the substrate, as the sparse cells did exhibit spreading at the 2.5-h time point. Notably, each of the molecules we have studied has been localized, at least in part, in focal contacts. To distinguish whether the tyrosine phosphorylations we observed were due to spreading, several approaches were taken. First, we utilized an entirely different protocol to study the density effect. In this protocol, cells were allowed to become confluent gradually. We plated cells at a fixed density (10%) onto fresh dishes and harvested them over several days at different levels of confluence. Cells were harvested at 20%, 40%, and 80% confluence. In this method, cells have had an equal opportunity to spread at all points; thus, differences seen should be independent of spreading. As before, molecular consequences of contact were evaluated by the phosphotyrosine pattern of the lysates (Fig. 8). Although this method lacks the acute nature of our first protocol, it is apparent that the effects of density are visible with both protocols. This alternative approach also served to validate the methodology used. Finally, we made use of the chance observation that cells treated with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin showed a large defect in their ability to spread on plastic tissue culture dishes (Fig. 9). Wortmannin dramatically inhibited spreading at early time points (30–60 min). This inhibition partially recovered by 2.5 h but still showed a large defect in spreading (Fig. 9). Lysates were prepared at 2.5 h from cells plated at different densities in the presence of wortmannin. These lysates were examined for their phosphotyrosine content as before. The pattern obtained from these lysates is similar to patterns of obtained without wortmannin (Fig. 10). This would indicate that many proteins can become tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to density in a PI 3-kinase-independent manner.Figure 10Anti-phosphotyrosine profile of wortmannin-treated cells. Balb 3T3 fibroblasts were plated onto 10-cm tissue culture dishes at 0.5 × 106, 1 × 106, 3 × 106, 5 × 106cells/dish in the presence of 100 nm wortmannin (W) or untreated (U.T.). The Pre plate represents cells before the replating. 2.5 h after plating cells were harvested, lysates separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and proteins transferred to nitrocellulose.

Complex signals such as stress, growth factor availability, the presence of extracellular matrix, and the presence of other cells among others must be translated into actions such as proliferation, growth arrest, differentiation, and migration. Many of these messages are sent from receptors on the cell surface to the nucleus via a complex network of signaling proteins that communicate with each other by phosphorylation. Although it has been known for years that most cells exhibit contact inhibition, the exact molecular details of this event remain unclear. Because the cell relies so heavily on tyrosine phosphorylation to communicate changes in the environment, we examined the changes in tyrosine phosphorylation patterns as a function of cell density. This was done by plating fibroblasts onto plastic tissue culture dishes at increasing density such that cells plated at the lowest density had few cell-cell contacts and cells at the highest density had a high level of cell-cell contact. As can be seen in Fig. 1 (phosphotyrosine blot), there are proteins for which tyrosine phosphate levels change in response to cell density. To our knowledge, this is the first time a protein phosphotyrosine profile, as a function of density, has been reported. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins suggests the activation of tyrosine kinases. In our density-depend"

In search of possible mechanisms for both the cytotoxicity and the activation of stress kinases by palytoxin, we found that palytoxin is a potent inhibitor of cellular protein synthesis. The inhibition of translation by palytoxin does not result from its direct binding to the translational apparatus. We have previously demonstrated that ribotoxic stressors (Iordanov, M.

Palytoxin acted as a ribotoxic stressor, inasmuch as it required actively translating ribosomes at the time of exposure to activate SAPK/JNK1. Palytoxin has been shown to augment ion fluxes by binding to the Na+/K+-ATPase in the plasma membrane of cells. To determine whether altered fluxes of either Na+ or K+ could be responsible for the effects of palytoxin on translation and on activation of SAPK/JNK1, cells were exposed to palytoxin in modified culture medium in which a major portion of the Na+ was replaced by either K+ or by choline+. The substitution of Na+ by K+ strongly inhibited the ability of palytoxin both to inhibit protein translation and to activate SAPK/JNK1, whereas the substitution of Na+ by choline+ did not. These results suggest that palytoxin-induced efflux of cellular K+ mimics ribotoxic stress by provoking both translational inhibition and activation of protein kinases associated with cellular defense against stress. The tumor promoter palytoxin has been found to activate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1 (SAPK/JNK1), and it also potentiates, as demonstrated here, the p38/HOG1 mitogen-activated protein kinase and the upstream activator of SAPK/JNK1, SEK1/MKK4.

Activation of SAPK/JNK1 and of its upstream activator SEK1/MKK4 by this group of ribotoxins can occur only when ribosomes are actively translating at the time of exposure to the ribotoxic stressor. Prior inhibition of translation by nonactivating agents such as diphtheria toxin, T-2 toxin, pactamycin, or emetine for as little time as 2 min abrogate the ability of the ribotoxic stressors, but not of IL-1α or osmotic stress, to stimulate SAPK/JNK1 activity. We concluded that the sensors for ribotoxic damage are ribosomes, which can transduce signals that activate SEK1/MKK4 and SAPK/JNK1 only when they are translationally active at the time of induced ribotoxicity. Although many stress signals ultimately converge to activate the stress kinases, signals arising during ribotoxicity are initially conveyed through a pathway distinct from those used by IL-1α and osmotic stress (1Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transduction of stress signals through ribosomes is a feature that eukaryotes share with prokaryotes, whose ribosomes respond to some translational inhibitors by recapitulating cellular responses characteristic of either heat shock or cold shock (42VanBogelen R. Neidhardt F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5589-5593Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In the experiments described here, we found that, like ribotoxic stressors, palytoxin potently inhibited protein synthesis in the concentration range that leads to activation of the stress kinases SEK1/MKK4, SAPK/JNK1, and p38/HOG1. Similar to ribotoxic stressors, the ability of palytoxin to activate SAPK/JNK1 depended on the presence of actively translating ribosomes at the time of exposure to palytoxin. However, unlike ribotoxic stressors, palytoxin did not inhibit protein synthesis as a consequence of direct binding to the translational apparatus. To determine whether the effects of palytoxin on translation and SAPK/JNK1 activation resulted from altered ionic fluxes, a major portion of the Na+ in the culture medium was replaced by either K+ or choline+. The substitution of Na+ by K+, but not by choline+, inhibited the ability of palytoxin both to inhibit protein translation and to activate SAPK/JNK1, suggesting that the efflux of cellular K+ may be responsible for both translational inhibition and activation of SAPK/JNK1. Thus, loss of K+ from stressed cells may lead to the activation of stress kinases through ribosome-mediated signaling. Anisomycin, emetine,d-sorbitol, and choline were from Sigma. IL-1α (recombinant mouse) was from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Palytoxin was from Calbiochem. Anisomycin, emetine, and palytoxin were dissolved in (H3C)2SO. In all the cases when (H3C)2SO was used as a vehicle, corresponding control cells received the same amount of the vehicle alone (typically not more than 0.2% (v/v)). d-Sorbitol was dissolved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) as a 3 m stock solution.

Determination of protein synthesis using FC2-Rat1 cells and a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay has been described by Rodland et al. (44Rodland K. Wersto R. Hobson S. Kohn E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The measurement of luciferase mRNA translation was performed with the Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate System (catalog number L4960) as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). The activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase in membranal preparations from Rat-1 cells was determined as described by Brotherus et al.(51Brotherus J.R. Moller J.V. Jorgensen P.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 100: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, S100 microsomal pellets (20 μg of total protein/experimental point) were resuspended in 0.6 ml of assay solution (pH 7.2; 0.6 mm EGTA, 156 mm NaCl, 24 mm KCl, 3.6 mm MgCl2, 3.6 mm ATP, 60 mm imidazole, 10 mmNa3N; with or without 0.5 mm ouabain) in the presence of varying concentrations of palytoxin. After 60 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 1.5 ml of ice-cold stopping solution (made by the sequential addition on ice of 21.3 ml of 1 m HCl, 18.3 ml of H2O, 1.29 g of l-ascorbic acid, 2.13 ml of 10% ammonium molybdate, and 3.3 ml of 20% SDS). After 10 min of incubation on ice, the color development was achieved by the addition of 1.5 ml of a solution containing 2% (w/v) sodium meta-arsenite, 2% (w/v) sodium citrate, and 2% (v/v) glacial acetic acid. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, the absorption of the samples was measured at 850 nm, and the amount of Pi in each sample was determined using a standard containing 50 μm Na3PO4. The quantification of 32PO43− transferred from ATP onto GST-Elk-1 in experiments measuring SAPK/JNK1 kinase activity was performed using the PhosphorImager apparatus and the IPLab Gel™ software from Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA). Statistical analyses were performed using the StatView™ software from Abacus Concepts, Inc. (Berkeley, CA). The addition of palytoxin to serum-deprived Rat-1 cells potently induced the activation of SAPK/JNK1 when examined 30 min later (Fig. 1, A and B). As reported previously by Kuroki et al. (17Kuroki D.W. Bignami G.S. Wattenberg E.V. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 637-644PubMed Google Scholar), the ability of palytoxin to activate SAPK/JNK1 was biphasic. At concentrations greater than 1 nm, cells displayed a decreased responsiveness to palytoxin; concentrations of palytoxin greater than 10 nmwere ineffective in activating SAPK/JNK1. SEK1/MKK4 is a kinase directly responsible for activation of SAPK/JNK1 (45Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 46Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.-X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M.

Science. 1995; 267: 682-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). Palytoxin showed the same dose dependence in causing the phosphorylation of SEK1/MKK4 at threonine 223, an event indicative of the activation of this kinase (48Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). These data suggest that activation of SAPK/JNK1 is mediated by kinase-directed signals generated upstream of SEK1/MKK4. Palytoxin showed a similar dose dependence in the activation of p38/HOG1, a member of the proline-directed stress kinases that bears functional and structural homology to SAPK/JNK1 (Fig. 1 A). As previously reported, palytoxin did not induce the activation of the MAP kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (data not shown). Previously we reported that some adverse agents that activate SAPK/JNK1 require ribosomes actively engaged in translation at the the moment of exposure to do so, while simultaneously inhibiting protein synthesis. These agents were termed ribotoxic stressors (1Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if it could be acting as a ribotoxic stressor, palytoxin was tested for its ability to inhibit the incorporation of [3H]leucine into proteins in Rat-1 cells. Indeed, palytoxin inhibited the incorporation of [3H]leucine in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). The ability of palytoxin to both activate stress kinases (Fig. 1, A and B) and repress [3H]leucine incorporation (Fig. 1 B) became apparent at concentrations of the toxin that were inhibitory for the Na+/K+-ATPase in membranal preparations isolated from Rat-1 cells (Fig. 1 B; see “Experimental Procedures,” and see below). Because palytoxin is known to act on membrane-associated functions, we considered the possibility that transport of [3H]leucine into cells is impaired following exposure to palytoxin. To avoid this potential complication, we applied a method for measuring cellular protein synthesis that is independent of transport and incorporation of amino acids. A derivative of the parental Rat-1 cells, the cell clone FC2-Rat1 bears a stably integrated CAT reporter gene under the control of a 1-kilobase promoter sequence of the human c-fos gene (44Rodland K. Wersto R. Hobson S. Kohn E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The expression of CAT mRNA is kept at very low levels in quiescent cells, but it can be induced up to 100-fold upon stimulation with EGF in the presence of cycloheximide (not shown). The presence of cycloheximide prevents the translation of the CAT mRNA into CAT protein. Release from the cycloheximide-induced translational arrest (Fig. 1 C, t = 0 min) allows efficient translation of the accumulated CAT mRNA. The accumulation of CAT protein increased linearly within 2 h following the washout of cycloheximide as measured by a CAT activity assay (Fig. 1 C). Since EGF was also removed from the medium together with cycloheximide, the increase of CAT activity resulted solely from translation of the CAT mRNA that had accumulated before the washout. Treatment of the cells with palytoxin 60 min after the release from translational arrest resulted in a substantial decrease in CAT activity detectable both 30 and 60 min after the addition of palytoxin (Fig. 1 C). We therefore conclude that exposure of cells to palytoxin indeed interferes with the process of translation. Many inhibitors of protein synthesis alter ribosomal activity by binding directly to ribosomes (49Pestka S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1971; 25: 487-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 50Vazquez D. Inhibitors of Protein Biosynthesis. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1979Crossref Google Scholar). The actions of these inhibitors are readily detected following their addition to reticulocyte lysates that contain ribosomes and all of the necessary ingredients to allow the initiation and elongation of translation in vitro. To test whether palytoxin could inhibit protein synthesis by directly modifying the functionality of ribosomes in vitro, we added palytoxin to a reticulocyte lysate preparation engaged in protein synthesis (Fig. 2). The addition to the reticulocyte lysate of mRNA for luciferase reporter protein (Fig. 2, t = 0 min) and subsequent monitoring of luciferase activity demonstrated the effectiveness of the lysate in promoting both initiation and elongation. The addition of the elongation inhibitor emetine at 8 min completely blocked the further accumulation of luciferase activity. Palytoxin (30 nm) was completely ineffective in inhibiting translation of luciferase when added prior to the addition of luciferase mRNA. These data demonstrate that neither translational initiation nor translational elongation were affected by the addition of palytoxin to a cell-free translational system. We therefore conclude that the inhibition of translation induced by palytoxin in vivo is unlikely to be mediated by direct interaction between palytoxin and the translational apparatus. The demonstration that palytoxin is a potent in vivo inhibitor of protein synthesis prompted us to test whether palytoxin shares some of the properties of ribotoxic stressors, which both activate SAPK/JNK1 and inhibit protein translation (1Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously showed that the activation of SAPK/JNK1 by ribotoxic stressors is rapidly suppressed in cells whose protein synthesis had been previously blocked by translational inhibitors that are incapable of activating SAPK/JNK1 (1Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mediation of SAPK/JNK1-activating signals could only occur in ribosomes that are active at the time of exposure of ribotoxic stressors. The following experiments test whether activation of SAPK/JNK1 by palytoxin similarly depends on the presence of active ribosomes. Pretreatment of cells for 15 min with emetine, an inhibitor of translational elongation, suppressed the palytoxin-induced activation of SAPK/JNK1 measured 30 min after the addition of palytoxin (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3). A similar suppression of SAPK/JNK1 activation was observed when cells were preincubated with pactamycin, a specific inhibitor of translational initiation (data not shown). Emetine also suppressed the activation of SAPK/JNK1 by the ribotoxic stressor anisomycin (1Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5), but not by sorbitol, an osmotic stressor that does not act through ribosomal toxicity (1Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, lanes 6 and 7). In studying the effects of ribotoxic stressors, we reported that inhibiting protein translation by emetine as soon as 1 min prior to the addition of anisomycin was sufficient to block transduction of the signals that lead ultimately to activation of SAPK/JNK1 (1Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This rapid action of emetine was taken as evidence that prior inhibition of translation by emetine was unlikely to exert its blockade of SAPK/JNK1 activation by blocking the synthesis of a protein with rapid decay kinetics (1Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The experiment presented in Fig. 4 similarly demonstrates that the addition of emetine 1 min prior to the addition of palytoxin substantially suppressed the activation of SAPK/JNK1. Emetine failed to suppress palytoxin-induced activation of SAPK/JNK1 when emetine was added 3 min after the addition of palytoxin. The ability of a translational inhibitor to block palytoxin-induced signaling within such a short time suggests that active ribosomes are necessary for signal transduction and furthermore argues against the likelihood that a protein with kinetics of rapid decay could explain the emetine-induced block to SAPK/JNK1 activation. The inability of emetine to inhibit SAPK/JNK1 signaling when added 3 min after the palytoxin addition suggests that the critical ribosome-mediated events that are required to transduce the signal have already occurred by 3 min. These data demonstrate that, similar to ribotoxic stressors, palytoxin requires the presence of active ribosomes at the time of addition to activate SAPK/JNK1. Several lines of evidence indicate that the biological effects of palytoxin are mediated through its interaction with the Na+/K+-ATPase (28Habermann E. Toxicon. 1989; 27: 1171-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 29Scheiner-Bobis G. Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Christ M. Habermann E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1132-1136PubMed Google Scholar, 30Redondo J. Fiedler B. Scheiner-Bobis G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar). The most convincing evidence derives from the introduction of a mammalian Na+/K+-ATPase into yeast, which demonstrated that palytoxin interacts directly with this molecule to facilitate the simultaneous entry of Na+ and exit of K+ from cells (29Scheiner-Bobis G. Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Christ M. Habermann E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1132-1136PubMed Google Scholar, 30Redondo J. Fiedler B. Scheiner-Bobis G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar). Since it appeared that the ribotoxic activity of palytoxin could not be related to direct interaction with the translational machinery, we tested whether the ribotoxic actions of palytoxin could have resulted from ionic disequilibria produced in cells as a consequence of poisoning of the Na+/K+-ATPase. To test this possibility, we conducted experiments in which 75% of the 154 mm NaCl present in MEM culture medium was replaced by either KCl (116 mm KCl; K-MEM) or choline chloride (116 mm; Cho-MEM). Experiments were conducted to determine whether the modified isotonic MEM containing either K+ or choline+would reduce the ability of palytoxin to inhibit protein synthesis or to activate SAPK/JNK1. Cells were far more sensitive to inhibition of protein synthesis by palytoxin in MEM, compared with K-MEM, which shifted the dose-response curve 2 decades to the right (Fig. 5). By contrast, cells were 3-fold more sensitive in Cho-MEM than in MEM. The ability of increased extracellular K+, but not choline+, to diminish substantially the ability of palytoxin to inhibit translation is consistent with the conclusion that efflux of K+ may be responsible for the effects of palytoxin. The inability of extracellular choline+ to reduce the translational inhibition by palytoxin is consistent with the notion that influx of Na+ is unlikely to be the cause of the effects of palytoxin. To determine whether the potential of palytoxin to inhibit protein translation in MEM, K-MEM, or Cho-MEM correlates with the potential to activate SAPK/JNK1, we exposed cells to standard or modified MEM for 30 min prior to the addition of palytoxin. The results demonstrate that, compared with MEM, K-MEM suppressed the ability of palytoxin to activate SAPK/JNK1, and that cells incubated in Cho-MEM showed a more pronounced activation of SAPK/JNK1 at equivalent palytoxin concentrations (Fig. 6 A). The cells in K-MEM were still capable of responding to other ribotoxic and nonribotoxic stressors, since the activity of SAPK/JNK1 was strongly elevated in cells exposed to K-MEM containing anisomycin (a ribotoxic stressor), sorbitol, or IL-1α. (Fig. 6 B). These data demonstrate that, in addition to its diminished ability to inhibit protein translation in K-MEM, palytoxin was also unable to activate SAPK/JNK1. These data also demonstrated that the inability of palytoxin to activate SAPK/JNK1 in K-MEM does not result from the general inhibition by K-MEM of pathways leading to SAPK/JNK1 activation. We next tested whether cells exposed to palytoxin in K-MEM were capable of responding to the toxin when transferred from K-MEM to standard MEM (Fig. 7). The increase in SAPK/JNK1 activity in cells exposed for 30 min to 0.1 nm palytoxin in standard MEM was inhibited in K-MEM (Fig. 7, lanes B and D). When cells incubated for 30 min in K-MEM containing palytoxin were rinsed with palytoxin-free K-MEM and transferred to standard MEM without palytoxin (Fig. 7, lane F), SAPK/JNK1 activity was increased to at least the same levels achieved by palytoxin in standard MEM. These data suggest that K-MEM impeded the transduction of a signal generated by palytoxin; shifting cells to standard MEM supplied the conditions necessary to complete transduction of the signal that leads to the activation of SAPK/JNK1. The increase in SAPK/JNK1 activity following the exchange of K-MEM for standard MEM again suggests that K+ efflux may be responsible for initiating the activation of SAPK/JNK1 in palytoxin-treated cells. The ability of palytoxin to both inhibit protein synthesis and stimulate SAPK/JNK1 activity (Fig. 1) led us to investigate whether palytoxin acts as a ribotoxic stressor. Previously identified ribotoxic stressors share the following characteristics: (i) they inhibit translational elongation by interacting directly with 28 S rRNA in the region of the peptidyl transferase center or the S/R loop; (ii) they rapidly induce the activation of the stress kinases SEK1/MKK4, SAPK/JNK1, and p38/HOG1; and (iii) they induce the activation of stress kinases only in cells that contain actively translating ribosomes (1Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other nonribotoxic stressors that activate stress kinases, such as proinflammatory cytokines and osmotic stress, are distinguished from ribotoxic stressors by their ability to induce signaling to the stress kinases even in the absence of translationally active ribosomes. Although experiments demonstrated that palytoxin was ineffective as a translational inhibitor when added directly to actively translating ribosomes in vitro (Fig. 2), palytoxin nevertheless required translating ribosomes to transduce signals that activate SAPK/JNK1in vivo. The rapid inhibition of SAPK/JNK1 activation by emetine, which substantially blocked the activation when added just 1 min prior to palytoxin (Fig. 3), was also observed when emetine was added just prior to ribotoxic stressors such as anisomycin and ricin (1Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rapid action of emetine in this context suggests that actively translating ribosomes are required for palytoxin-initiated signals to be transduced to the kinase(s) upstream of SEK1/MKK4 and SAPK/JNK1. That cells exposed to palytoxin became refractory to emetine when emetine was added 3 min after palytoxin suggests that the critical events of ribosome-mediated transduction are completed by 3 min. A similar time course was observed for anisomycin (1Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.-Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2M. S. Iordanov, D. Pribnow, J. L. Magun, J. A. Pearson, T.-H. Dinh, and B. E. Magun, submitted for publication. Since the effects of palytoxin include translational inhibition, it appears plausible that the signaling is self-terminating and that the involvement of ribosomes in this process is completed within this short period of time. The binding of palytoxin to Na+/K+-ATPase results in an “open” ion channel that permits free passage of Na+ and K+ into or out of cells, depending on the ion gradient on both sides of the cell membrane (28Habermann E. Toxicon. 1989; 27: 1171-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 29Scheiner-Bobis G. Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Christ M. Habermann E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1132-1136PubMed Google Scholar, 30Redondo J. Fiedler B. Scheiner-Bobis G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar). Kurokiet al. (17Kuroki D.W. Bignami G.S. Wattenberg E.V. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 637-644PubMed Google Scholar) reported that in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts DMEM in which Na+ was replaced by K+ suppressed the ability of palytoxin to activate SAPK/JNK1; from these data they concluded that palytoxin-activated Na+ influx was responsible for the activation of SAPK/JNK1. Our data in Rat-1 fibroblasts are in agreement with those of Kuroki et al.(17Kuroki D.W. Bignami G.S. Wattenberg E.V. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 637-644PubMed Google Scholar) and furthermore demonstrated that replacement of Na+by K+ strongly suppressed the translational inhibition by palytoxin (Figs. 5 and 6). However, neither SAPK/JNK1 activation nor translational inhibition was diminished when Na+ was replaced by choline+, a nonpenetrating cation used to maintain osmotic balance, and in fact both SAPK/JNK1 activation and translational inhibition were increased in the choline+-containing medium. These data suggest that palytoxin-induced efflux of K+, rather than influx of Na+, was responsible for both SAPK/JNK1 activation and translational inhibition. The inability of K-MEM to suppress the activation of SAPK/JNK1 mediated by other agents such as anisomycin, sorbitol, or IL-1α suggests that replacement of Na+ by K+ did not generally inhibit the transduction of stress-generated signals from other ribotoxic or nonribotoxic stressors. Additionally, the activation of SAPK/JNK1 and suppression of translation that occurred in palytoxin-treated cells following the removal of K-MEM and replacement by palytoxin-free MEM demonstrates that the exposure of cells to K-MEM did not impair the ability of the cells to respond when placed in an appropriate ionic environment. Palytoxin is the most potent nonproteinaceous toxin that has been identified. Although the ability of palytoxin to alter cation fluxes has been well documented, to date there has been no explanation for its severe toxicity. The demonstration in this paper that palytoxin can inhibit protein synthesis at picomolar concentrations (IC50= 1 pm, Fig. 1 B) places palytoxin among the most potent translational inhibitors, and this may account for its potent toxicity.

https://openalex.org/W2127510353,"To elucidate the mechanism whereby liganded receptor molecules enhance nucleotide exchange of GTP-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins), changes in the secondary structure of the recombinant Gi1 α subunit (Gi1α) upon binding with receptor mimetics, compound 48/80 and mastoparan, were analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Compound 48/80 enhanced the initial rate of GTPγS binding to soluble Gi1α 2.6-fold with an EC50 of 30 μg/ml. With the same EC50, the mimetic decreased the magnitude of ellipticity, which is ascribed to a reduction in α helix content of the Gi1α by 7%. Likewise, mastoparan also enhanced the rate of GTPγS binding by 3.0-fold and decreased the magnitude of ellipticity of Gi1α similar to compound 48/80. In corresponding experiments using a K349P-Gi1α, a Gi1α counterpart of the unc mutant in Gsα in which Pro was substituted for Lys349, enhancement of the GTPγS binding rate by both activators was quite small. In addition, compound 48/80 showed a negligible effect on the circular dichroism spectrum of the mutant. On the other hand, a proteolytic fragment of Gi1α lacking the N-terminal 29 residues was activated and showed decreased ellipticity upon interaction with the compound, as did the wild-type Gi1α. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the activator-induced unwinding of the α helix of the G protein α subunit is mechanically coupled to the enhanced release of bound GDP from the α subunit. To elucidate the mechanism whereby liganded receptor molecules enhance nucleotide exchange of GTP-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins), changes in the secondary structure of the recombinant Gi1 α subunit (Gi1α) upon binding with receptor mimetics, compound 48/80 and mastoparan, were analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Compound 48/80 enhanced the initial rate of GTPγS binding to soluble Gi1α 2.6-fold with an EC50 of 30 μg/ml. With the same EC50, the mimetic decreased the magnitude of ellipticity, which is ascribed to a reduction in α helix content of the Gi1α by 7%. Likewise, mastoparan also enhanced the rate of GTPγS binding by 3.0-fold and decreased the magnitude of ellipticity of Gi1α similar to compound 48/80. In corresponding experiments using a K349P-Gi1α, a Gi1α counterpart of the unc mutant in Gsα in which Pro was substituted for Lys349, enhancement of the GTPγS binding rate by both activators was quite small. In addition, compound 48/80 showed a negligible effect on the circular dichroism spectrum of the mutant. On the other hand, a proteolytic fragment of Gi1α lacking the N-terminal 29 residues was activated and showed decreased ellipticity upon interaction with the compound, as did the wild-type Gi1α. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the activator-induced unwinding of the α helix of the G protein α subunit is mechanically coupled to the enhanced release of bound GDP from the α subunit.

Upon ligand binding, a G protein-coupled receptor promotes the release of GDP from inactive trimeric Gαβγ, which allows binding of cytosolic GTP to the remaining Gα subunit, thereby resulting in dissociation of trimeric Gα(GTP)βγ complex into active Gα·GTP and a βγ subunit complex. In this activation process of G protein, the release of bound GDP is of particular interest as it is the rate-limiting step (4Ferguson K.M. Higashijima T. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7393-7399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The analyses of x-ray crystallographic structures of the α subunit of Gt and Gi1 have indicated the presence of two domains, i.e. a GTPase (or Ras-like) domain comprised of α helices and β strands and a highly α helical domain. In addition, the conformational changes induced in the α subunit by nucleotide exchange (GDP → GTPγS) and the mechanism of GTP hydrolysis have been determined (5Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

Conformational changes in the α subunit upon binding with a βγ subunit complex have been determined as well (10Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iñiguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism whereby liganded receptor molecules enhance the GDP release from the α subunit remains unclear, as pointed out previously (3Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 12Bourne H. Science. 1995; 270: 933-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Likewise, the conformational change of the α subunit upon receptor binding is unknown. The use of physicochemical methods to gain further insight into these key reactions presents difficulties due to the facts that (i) only small amounts of G protein-coupled receptor proteins are expressed in cells, and (ii) no method exists for suitably analyzing the structure of a protein complexed with a large membrane protein. We considered that mastoparan (MP), a 14-residue peptide discovered in wasp venom as the agent that induces histamine release from mast cells (13Higashijima T. Uzu S. Nakajima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6491-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), might provide some important clues because it activates Go and Gi in a similar manner; its activation is both Mg2+-dependent and blocked by ADP-ribosylation of G proteins (13Higashijima T. Uzu S. Nakajima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6491-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Higashijima T. Burnier J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14176-14186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has an amphiphilic sequence, as do putative G protein-binding sites of many receptors, namely, second and third intracellular loops and C-terminal tail (15Ross E.M. Neuron. 1989; 3: 141-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In fact, peptide fragments corresponding to the third intracellular loop of β adrenergic receptors were found to activate Gs (Refs. 16Palm D. Münch G. Dees C. Hekman M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 254: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Cheung A.H. Huang R.R. Graziano M.P. Strader C.D.

Also of interest, Go and Gi are known to be activated by another histamine releaser that is also amphiphilic, i.e. compound 48/80 (C48/80) (20Tomita U. Inanobe A. Kobayashi I. Takahashi K. Ui M. Katada T. J. Biochem. 1991; 109: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These compounds are particularly useful for analyzing G protein activation when employed as low molecular weight mimetics of receptors. As such, the present study uses circular dichroism (CD) spectra to analyze conformational changes in Gi1α upon interaction with these two compounds. Analysis of CD spectra is an ideal method for determining overall structural changes in proteins. For example, CD measurements of a DNA-binding domain of yeast transcription activator GCN4 estimated that its α helix content increases from 70–73% to 95–100% upon interaction with DNA containing its binding site (AP-1 site) (21Weiss M.A. Ellenberger T. Wobbe C.R. Lee J.P. Harrison S.C. Struhl K. Nature. 1990; 347: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). This estimation was later confirmed by the NMR analysis of the structure in a DNA-free state (22Saudek V. Pasley H.S. Gibson T. Gausepohl H. Frank R. Pastore A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and the x-ray crystallographic analysis of the structure in a DNA-bound state (23Ellenberger T.E. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). In the present study, the CD analysis of Gi1α allowed us to determine how the interaction affects the α helicity of Gi1α with the resultant conformational changes leading to the enhancement of GDP release. The following materials were used: Ni2+-NTA agarose (Qiagen), GTPγS and sequencing grade endoproteinase Lys-C (Boehringer Mannheim), [α-33P]GTP and [35S]GTPγS (New England Nuclear), C48/80 2We found that some lots of C48/80 give noisy spectra in 200–210 nm; when large noises are observed in its CD spectrum, another lot should be tested. (oligomer ofp-methoxy-N-methylphenethylamine) (Sigma), Lubrol PX (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), 5′-GDP sodium salt (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan), standard bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml) solution (Pierce), and BA85 nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher & Schuell). GTPγS was purified by Mono Q (Pharmacia) anion exchange chromatography. MP was synthesized by standard solid-phase methodology and purified as described previously (24Saito K. Higashijima T. Miyazawa T. Wakimasu M. Fujino M. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1984; 32: 2187-2193Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). All other reagents were of analytical grade (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). Because histidine-tagged proteins can easily be purified by affinity purification on Ni2+-NTA agarose, we prepared Gi1α tagged with 10 histidine residues (His10-Giα) as well as nontagged full-length Gi1α (FL-Giα) as a control. We also prepared a Lys349 → Pro mutant in His10-Giα (K349P-Giα), a mutant corresponding to the unc mutant in Gsα (25Haga T. Ross E.M. Anderson H.J. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2016-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,26Sullivan K.A. Miller R.T. Masters S.B. Beiderman B. Heideman W. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1987; 330: 758-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and is expected to be insensitive to activators, and a 325-amino acid proteolytic fragment of Gi1α lacking the N-terminal 29 residues (ΔN-Giα), which allowed us to investigate whether the protein's N-terminal segment is involved in activation. FL-Giα was expressed in Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) cells harboring the pQE60/Gi1α plasmid (27Itoh H. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16226-16231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified as described (28Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 202-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and His10-Giα was prepared as follows. After cloning cDNA of Gi1α using polymerase chain reaction with appropriate primers and QUICK-Clone cDNA (CLONTECH) as a template, the product cDNA was ligated into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET19b (Novagen), which we modified beforehand by adding an adapter sequence giving a sequence encoding Met-Gly-(His)10-(Ser)2-Gly-His-Ile-(Asp)4-Lys-His at the N terminus of Gi1α. Next, the complete coding sequence, the XbaI-BamHI fragment of pET19b-Gi1α, was ligated into the XbaI and BamHI sites of pET24a(+) (Novagen) to produce pET24a(+)/His10-Giα, which was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Finally, His10-Giα protein was expressed and purified as described (29Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). K349P-Giα was prepared by subcloning into the BamHI and SalI sites of pUC19 aBglII-SalI fragment of pET24a(+)/His10-Giα corresponding to the 3′ terminal 490 bp of the entire Gi1α sequence. Then, to substitute Pro for Lys349, the generated plasmid was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis (27Itoh H. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16226-16231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 5′-GAGACCACAGTCTGGTAGGTTATT-3′ as a mutagenic primer; the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The entire coding sequence was subsequently obtained by ligating the DraI-SalI fragment of pUC19 possessing the mutated sequence of the 3′ terminal of the Gi1α sequence into theDraI-SalI sites of pET24a(+)/His10-Giα. The mutant protein was correspondingly expressed and purified like wild-type His10-Giα. To prepare ΔN-Giα, His10-Giα protein was subjected to limited digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C as described (6Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The cleavage site was confirmed by amino acid sequencing (Applied Biosystems 477A Protein Sequencer), and the integrity of the C terminus was determined by Western blot analysis using antiserum specific to the C-terminal 10 residues of Gi1α. 3H. Itoh, unpublished results. In addition to these proteins, which are bound by GDP, we also prepared His10-Giα in GTPγS- and GDP·AlF4−-bound forms to investigate the effect of bound nucleotide on the secondary structure of the protein. The GTPγS-bound form was prepared by incubating 10 mg/ml of His10-Giα in the GDP-form at 30 °C for 5 h in a buffer of 100 mm sodium Hepes (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm MgSO4, and 2 mm GTPγS; the complete conversion was confirmed by demonstrating trypsin resistance (30Mazzoni M.R. Malinski J.A. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14072-14081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). His10-Giα in the GDP·AlF4−-form was correspondingly prepared using a buffer containing 30 μm AlCl3 and 10 mm NaF in place of GTPγS; the complete conversion was confirmed by verifying that this form did not bind [35S]GTPγS (7Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). The concentration of all proteins was determined by Amido Black staining using bovine serum albumin as the standard (31Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar). Because the effects of MP and C48/80 have been studied mostly on trimeric G proteins reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles, their effects on soluble Gi1α were compared against those determined by CD spectra analysis. Activator enhancement of the initial GTPγS binding rate was determined as follows. Binding buffer containing 50 mmsodium Hepes (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 2 μm[35S]GTPγS (6000 cpm/pmol) with or without activators was preincubated at 30 °C for 5 min, G proteins (0.2 μm) were added, and the solution was incubated further at 30 °C as described (32Ross E.M. Higashijima T. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). At the indicated times, 50-μl aliquots were diluted with 0.5 ml of ice-cold 20 mm sodium Hepes (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 160 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm GTP, filtered on BA85 nitrocellulose filter, washed with 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, and the amount of bound [35S]GTPγS was determined on a liquid scintillation counter. Glycerol (10%), which stabilizes His10-Giα, was added to the buffer to prevent precipitation. This addition led to approximately a 2-fold decrease in the GTPγS binding rate for all proteins, in both the absence and presence of the activators. GTPγS binding activity of His10-Giα under the CD measurement conditions was determined as follows. His10-Giα (3.5 μm) was incubated in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol in the absence or presence of 100 μg/ml C48/80 at 25 °C. At the indicated times, 50-μl aliquots were withdrawn and added to 450 μl of 50 mmsodium Hepes (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm MgCl2, and 2 μm[35S]GTPγS (1, 500 cpm/pmol), incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and the amount of bound [35S]GTPγS was determined as described above. Assays were performed in duplicate at least twice using a fresh protein solution each time. Data consisted of average values of duplicate determinations and varied less than 5%. To examine whether His10-Giα is denatured in the presence of C48/80, the amount of GDP bound to Gi1α under the CD measurement conditions was determined according to Refs. 32Ross E.M. Higashijima T. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar and33Rubenstein R.C. Linder M.E. Ross E.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10769-10777Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar. His10-Giα (0.3 mm) was incubated in 50 mm sodium Hepes (pH 8.0), 1 mmEDTA, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm [α-33P] GTP (87.6 cpm/pmol) at 30 °C for 3 h; bound GTP was hydrolyzed to GDP during this incubation. The binding reaction was quenched by adding 12 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) and the free nucleotide was removed by gel filtration. [α-33P]GDP-bound His10-Giα (3.5 μm, 82.3 cpm/pmol) was then incubated in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol in the absence or presence of 100 μg/ml C48/80 at 25 °C. At the indicated times, 50-μl aliquots were withdrawn, diluted with 0.5 ml of ice-cold 20 mmsodium Hepes (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm AlCl3, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm NaF and filtered on BA85 nitrocellulose filter, and the bound radioactivity was determined on a liquid scintillation counter. G protein (3.5 μm) was incubated in a buffer of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol at 25 °C for 10 min unless otherwise indicated. CD spectra were then recorded at 25 °C on a J-720 spectropolarimeter (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) using a cuvette with a path length of 2 mm. For each sample, four scans were accumulated in approximately 3 min. To eliminate contributions by the activator or buffer, the CD spectrum of a protein is shown as the difference spectrum: the spectrum recorded in the presence or absence of an activator minus the spectrum of an activator or buffer alone. Measurements were repeated at least twice using freshly prepared solutions, and the results were fully reproducible. The resultant difference spectra are representative of two or three measurements, which varied less than 1% at 210 nm. The dependence of [θ′]222 on C48/80 concentration was determined in duplicate twice, and an average value for a single run is presented. Corresponding analysis was not performed using MP as described under “Results.” The α helix content of Gi1α was estimated by convex constraint analysis (CCA) (34Perczel A. Park K. Fasman G.D. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and a self-consistent method (SELCON) (35Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Both techniques utilized CD data at wavelengths from 200 to 240 nm with the assumption of three independent basis curves. In contrast to methods that use ellipticities at a single wavelength (36Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3296) Google Scholar, 37Scholtz J.M. Qian H. York E.J. Stewart J.M. Baldwin R.L. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), these methods are known to estimate secondary structure contents accurately (38Greenfield N.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). To predict which α helix is unwound upon interaction with C48/80, secondary structure preference of rat Gi1α was estimated by two independent methods: Garnier-Osguthorpe-Robson (GOR) (39Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3394) Google Scholar) and neural network (NNPREDICT) (40Kneller D.G. Cohen F.E. Langridge R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Those amino acid sequences in the GTPase-domain that are α helical in the crystal structure of Gi1α in the GDP form (Protein Data Bank accession code, 1GDD) (9Mixon M.B. Lee E. Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1995; 270: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) with five residues extended to both the N- and C-terminal directions were analyzed by these methods. The prediction was not performed of the very short αN2 helix (residues 20–23). The effects of MP and C48/80 on GTPγS binding to FL- and K349P-Giα are illustrated in Fig. 1, A and B, respectively, and Table I summarizes the initial binding rates and fold enhancement of each G protein examined. Note that (i) all four proteins show similar initial GTPγS binding rates in the absence of the activators; (ii) MP and C48/80 similarly enhance the initial binding rate of FL-, His10-, and ΔN-Giα by 2.5–3.0-fold; and (iii) enhancement is very weak for K349P-Giα. Accordingly, the affinity of a GDP molecule for Gi1α was not altered by the addition of the His10 tag, substitution of Pro for Lys349, or the deletion of the N-terminal 29 residues. However, the substitution of Pro for Lys349 substantially weakened activation by MP and C48/80.Table IInitial rates and fold enhancements of GTPγS binding of various Gi1α proteins in the presence of activatorsGi1α proteinInitial GTPγS binding rateControl+MP+C48/80min−1 × 10−2FL0.78 ± 0.032.34 ± 0.04 (3.0)1-aValues in parentheses indicate fold enhancement relative to control values.2.04 ± 0.21 (2.6)His100.75 ± 0.051.96 ± 0.07 (2.6)2.06 ± 0.08 (2.7)K349P0.73 ± 0.060.83 ± 0.03 (1.1)1.09 ± 0.09 (1.5)ΔN0.75 ± 0.031.85 ± 0.09 (2.5)1.78 ± 0.07 (2.4)1-a Values in parentheses indicate fold enhancement relative to control values. Open table in a new tab To confirm that His10-Giα is not denatured in the presence of C48/80, the amount of GDP bound to His10-Giα was determined under the CD measurement conditions. In the CD buffer that did not contain guanine nucleotides, dissociation of GDP did not occur in either the absence or the presence of 100 μg/ml C48/80 up to 50 min (Fig. 2). When free GDP was included in the buffer, marked release of GDP was observed, and its release rate was increased in the presence of C48/80 (data not shown). GTPγS binding activity of His10-Giα in the presence of 100 μg/ml C48/80 was also determined with different preincubation times with C48/80. The GTPγS binding activity did not change significantly (<5%) up to 50 min (data not shown). Fig. 3 A illustrates the CD spectrum of FL-Giα in the GDP-bound form. CCA and SELCON analysis of the spectrum gave α helix values of 50.6 and 55.9%, respectively; these values were in good agreement with that obtained by x-ray crystallographic analysis of the Gi1α·GDP structure (9Mixon M.B. Lee E. Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1995; 270: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), which should be expected because both CCA and SELCON are known to show high accuracy in estimating α helix content (38Greenfield N.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 A also illustrates the CD spectra of His10-Giα in the GDP-, GDP·AlF4−-, and GTPγS-bound forms. The magnitude of ellipticity is greater in FL-Giα·GDP than in His10-Giα·GDP. This is presumably due to the absence of an ordered structure in the His10 tag segment. There were few spectral differences among the three forms of His10-Giα, indicating that the secondary structure of Gi1α does not substantially change irrespective of the chemical structure of the phosphate moiety of the guanine nucleotides bound (see Fig. 3, B and C, for expansion around 210 and 220 nm, respectively). This is consistent with the x-ray analysis results indicating the presence of few differences among the secondary structure contents of Gi1α in the GDP-, GDP·AlF4−-, and GTPγS-bound forms and among corresponding forms with Gtα (5Noel J.P.

Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar) is disordered in the GDP form (9Mixon M.B. Lee E. Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1995; 270: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, the secondary structure contents of the two forms do not differ much because Gi1α in the GDP form contains N1 and N2 helices that are not found in the GTPγS form and its α5 helix is longer than that of the GTPγS form. The difference spectra of FL-Giα in the presence of MP (100 μm) or C48/80 (100 μg/ml) are illustrated in Fig. 3 D. Their presence decreased the magnitude of the ellipticity at 205–235 nm, which indicates changes in its secondary structure. The difference spectrum in the presence of MP, however, is not considered to accurately reflect the structure of the protein for the following reason. The MP molecule is known to adopt an α helical conformation when bound to Gi1α (41Sukumar M. Higashijima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21421-21424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although taking no ordered conformation in an aqueous solution (42Higashijima T. Wakamatsu K. Takemitsu M. Fujino M. Nakajima T. Miyazawa T. FEBS Lett. 1983; 152: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). When it is considered that the magnitude of negative ellipticity of the α helix is larger than that of random coil from 205 to 240 nm (38Greenfield N.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) and that the fraction of Gi1α-bound MP molecules is only 3.5% at most, this indicates that MP shows negative ellipticity slightly larger in magnitude in the presence of Gi1α than in its absence; accordingly, the magnitude of ellipticity contributed by Gi1α in the presence of MP should be smaller than that shown in Fig. 3 D. The conclusion still holds, however, that the magnitude of ellipticity of Gi1α is decreased upon interaction with MP. On the other hand, the difference spectra in the presence of C48/80 are accurate because C48/80 shows no ellipticity from 200 to 250 nm (data not shown); only the difference spectra obtained with this activator were subsequently considered. In agreement with the observation that GDP molecules are not released from His10-Giα in the absence of free guanine nucleotides even in the presence of 100 μg/ml C48/80 (Fig. 2), the addition of 50 μm GDP did not affect the CD spectra in either the absence or the presence of C48/80 (data not shown). These data confirm that the difference spectrum in the presence of this activator (Fig. 3 D) reflects the secondary structure of Gi1α·GDP in the activated state rather than the structure of guanine nucleotide-free Gi1α. Fig. 3 E illustrates the dependence of [θ′]222 on the concentration of C48/80 in FL-Giα. With an EC50 value of 31.8 ± 2.6 μg/ml, the spectral change reaches a plateau at about 100 μg/ml. At this saturation concentration, CCA and SELCON analyses gave α helix values of 43.8 and 49.3%, respectively. Both of these values are 7% lower than the original values; this reduction corresponds to the unwinding of the α helix by 20 of 354 amino acid residues. Fig. 4, A–C, illustrates difference spectra for His10-, ΔN-, and K349P-Giα with C48/80 (100 μg/ml). The CD spectra of His10- and ΔN-Giα show a marked and similar decrease in the magnitude of ellipticity as for FL-Giα. This indicates that the His10 tag segment of His10-Giα and the N-terminal 29 residues of FL-Giα do not change their conformations upon interaction with C48/80. This also suggests that His10-Giα can be conveniently used as a substitute for FL-Giα for conformation analys"
https://openalex.org/W2060442204,"Fluorescent and non-fluorescent probes have been used to show that divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+) significantly increase hydrophobic exposure on GroEL, whereas monovalent cations (K+ and Na+) have little effect. Zn2+ always induced the largest amount of hydrophobic exposure on GroEL. By using a new method based on interactions of GroEL with octyl-Sepharose, it was demonstrated that Zn2+ binding strengthens GroEL hydrophobic binding interactions and increases the efficiency of substrate release upon the addition of MgATP and GroES. The binding of 4,4′-bis(1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid) to GroEL in the presence of Zn2+ has a K d ≅ 1 μm, which is similar to that observed previously for the GroEL 4,4′-bis(1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid) complex. Urea denaturation, sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation, and electron microscopy revealed that the quaternary structure of GroEL in the presence of Zn2+ had a stability and morphology equivalent to unliganded GroEL. In contrast, circular dichroism suggested some loss in both α-helical and β-sheet secondary structure in the presence of Zn2+. These data suggest that divalent cations can modulate the amount of hydrophobic surface presented by GroEL. Furthermore, the influence of Zn2+ on GroEL hydrophobic surface exposure as well as substrate binding and release appears to be distinct from the stabilizing effects of Mg2+ on GroEL quaternary structure.

In vitro studies have demonstrated that the information necessary for a polypeptide to attain its native conformation is contained within its amino acid sequence (1Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5070) Google Scholar). However, the yield of folded protein in vitro is often quite low, in part because aggregation competes with folding. Recently, a highly conserved family of proteins, the Hsp60 molecular chaperones, has been suggested to be able to facilitate protein folding both in vivo and in vitro (2Ellis R.J. van der Vies S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 321-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary function of the molecular chaperones appears to be preventing aggregation of partially folded intermediates (3Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F.X. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 4Goloubinoff P. Christeller J.T. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar).The Escherichia coli protein GroEL is homologous to the eukaryotic mitochondrial protein Hsp60, and it is among the best characterized molecular chaperones. GroEL is composed of 14 57-kDa subunits arranged in two stacked, seven-membered rings with 7-fold symmetry to form a cylinder with a central cavity (14-mer) (5Hendrix R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 375-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). GroEL assists in vitro refolding of a number of proteins, and it has been shown to be able to interact with over half of the proteins from E. coli (6Viitanen P.V. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The mechanistic features for the binding and release of substrate polypeptides by GroEL are not completely understood. The promiscuous nature of GroEL-polypeptide interactions suggests that a GroEL recognition motif is not specific for polypeptide sequence. Thus, a GroEL substrate protein recognition motif must include characteristics that are common in a variety of incompletely folded polypeptides that are not present in their native forms which interact weakly or not at all with the chaperonin.A key feature of protein folding intermediates is the easy accessibility of hydrophobic residues that would typically be buried in the native conformation of the protein. It has been suggested that GroEL binds the compact folding intermediates (molten globules) of proteins produced in the course of folding (7Flynn G.C. Beckers C.J.M. Baase W.A. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10826-10830Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and recent calorimetric studies have demonstrated that hydrophobic interactions are an important driving force for the association of substrate proteins with GroEL (8Lin Z. Schwarz F.P. Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1011-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Further evidence for the importance of hydrophobic interactions came from mutational analysis (9Fenton W.A. Kasha Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). That study identified polypeptide binding sites on the inside surfaces of the GroEL apical domains (one of the three domains into which the monomer is folded), facing the central channel. Interestingly, all of the apical domain residues determined to be essential for substrate polypeptide binding were hydrophobic residues.Paradoxically, when the accessibility of hydrophobic surfaces on GroEL was assayed with the hydrophobic probe bis-ANS, 1The abbreviations used are: bis-ANS, 4,4′-bis(1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid); TNS, 6-(p- toluidinyl)naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 1The abbreviations used are: bis-ANS, 4,4′-bis(1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid); TNS, 6-(p- toluidinyl)naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin. only 1.4 molecules of bis-ANS were bound per GroEL 14-mer (10Horowitz P.M. Hua S. Gibbons D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1535-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This implies that most of the hydrophobic residues used for polypeptide binding are either buried or that the negatively charged bis-ANS molecule does not have access to the hydrophobic residues, due to the high net negative charge on GroEL (−266 per 14-mer).The importance of charge to GroEL interactions has been suggested by studies of polypeptide binding and the effects of ions on the quaternary structure of the chaperonin (11Itzhaki L.S. Otzen D.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14581-14587Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 12Azem A. Diamant S. Goloubinoff P.

In this report, we demonstrate the importance of divalent cations in altering the apparent amount of hydrophobic surface presented by GroEL. The binding of divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+), but not monovalent cations (K+ and Na+), results in an increase in the amount of GroEL hydrophobic surface exposure, with zinc inducing the greatest effects.DISCUSSIONGroEL binds a variety of polypeptides in their non-native states (3Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F.X. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 20Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5665-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). This implies that the primary sequence of a substrate polypeptide does not supply the information required for recognition. Thus, binding must occur by a more general mechanism of molecular recognition. A common feature of unfolded and misfolded polypeptides is the solvent exposure of hydrophobic residues that would be buried in the native state. It is generally accepted that GroEL polypeptide interactions occur by hydrophobic association. Several studies have described these interactions and stated the importance of GroEL hydrophobic binding of substrate polypeptides (8Lin Z. Schwarz F.P. Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1011-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 22Zahn R. Axmann S.E. Rucknagel K.P. Jaeger E. Laminet A.A. Pluckthun A. J. Mol.

The GroEL crystal structure (24Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar), complemented by GroEL mutational analysis (9Fenton W.A. Kasha Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), has made it possible to suggest the substrate polypeptide binding sites on GroEL. These sites are within flexible segments containing hydrophobic residues in the apical domains of the GroEL 14-mer. However, when hydrophobic surfaces on unliganded GroEL are probed with bis-ANS, only a few molecules of bis-ANS bind per GroEL 14-mer (10Horowitz P.M. Hua S. Gibbons D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1535-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This result raises an interesting question. If GroEL substrate polypeptide binding occurs by hydrophobic association in the apical domains of GroEL, where are all the hydrophobic sites on GroEL?The answer to this question may be that hydrophobic sites on GroEL are buried until the appropriate ligands signal their exposure. For example, several studies have demonstrated that GroEL quaternary structure changes after the addition of adenine nucleotides and divalent cations (12Azem A. Diamant S. Goloubinoff P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6671-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Saibil H.R. Zheng D. Roseman A.M. Hunter A.S. Watson G.M.F. Chen S. auf der Mauer A. O'Hara B.P. Wood S.P. Mann N.H. Barnett L.K. Ellis R.J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 265-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thus, it could be conjectured that subsequent to these quaternary changes, there is an exposure of GroEL hydrophobic surfaces. It is also possible that the substrate polypeptide itself might be able to trigger GroEL hydrophobic surface(s). It was shown in an experiment using a positively charged amphipathic peptide that the binding of the peptide to GroEL induced hydrophobic surfaces on GroEL (26Brazil B.T. Cleland J.L. McDowell R.S. Skelton N.J. Paris K. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5105-5111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, ligand-induced exposure of hydrophobic surfaces on GroEL may be a mechanism to present hydrophobic binding surfaces to substrate polypeptide. Furthermore, the interaction of a positively charged protein with GroEL has also been described as an effector of GroEL substrate polypeptide binding (11Itzhaki L.S. Otzen D.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14581-14587Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In that study, it was demonstrated by point mutations within the protein chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 that positive charges on the protein confer tighter binding to GroEL, whereas negative charges on chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 diminish binding (11Itzhaki L.S. Otzen D.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14581-14587Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).It has been demonstrated in this study that hydrophobic surface(s) on GroEL can be significantly increased upon the addition of divalent cations. The fluorescent probes bis-ANS, Nile Red, and TNS were used to demonstrate that additions of divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+) but not monovalent cations (K+ and Na+) result in an increase in the fluorescence intensity of each probe. The presence of hydrophobic surfaces on GroEL was also measured by the non-fluorescent method using octyl-Sepharose (Fig. 3). The results of that experiment also demonstrate an increase in GroEL hydrophobic surfaces in the presence of divalent cations. This indicates that, independent of the method of hydrophobic measurements, the effects of divalent cations on GroEL hydrophobic surface exposure still occur. One of the most interesting findings in this study is the contribution of Zn2+ in strengthening GroEL substrate binding and increasing the efficiency of substrate release upon the addition of MgATP and GroES.Magnesium has been previously shown to stabilize the quaternary structure of GroEL (12Azem A. Diamant S. Goloubinoff P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6671-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Gorovits B.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28551-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The present work shows that zinc does not stabilize the GroEL quaternary structure (Fig. 4), but it does appear to influence the secondary structure of GroEL (Fig. 5). In contrast, there was no detectable change in the GroEL secondary structure in the presence of magnesium (data not shown). These results suggest that Zn2+ binding can affect the secondary structure in a region that does not significantly contribute to the global stability of GroEL as reported by the methods used in this study.Thus, it appears that interactions with divalent cations can modulate the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces presented by GroEL, with Zn2+ being the most effective. It is possible that GroEL has a low affinity metal binding site (12Azem A. Diamant S. Goloubinoff P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6671-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or that the divalent cations act in a more general fashion by shielding the negative charge on GroEL. For example, due to the high net negative charge on GroEL (−266 per 14-mer), it may be that cationic interactions of salts and/or cationic amphipathic secondary structure on substrate polypeptides are required for a coordinated exposure of buried hydrophobic binding sites on GroEL. Thus, the binding of divalent cations to GroEL may be a way of fine-tuning the exposure of hydrophobic residues for the binding of unfolded substrate polypeptides. In vitro studies have demonstrated that the information necessary for a polypeptide to attain its native conformation is contained within its amino acid sequence (1Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5070) Google Scholar). However, the yield of folded protein in vitro is often quite low, in part because aggregation competes with folding.

Barnett L.K. Ellis R.J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 265-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thus, it could be conjectured that subsequent to these quaternary changes, there is an exposure of GroEL hydrophobic surfaces. It is also possible that the substrate polypeptide itself might be able to trigger GroEL hydrophobic surface(s). It was shown in an experiment using a positively charged amphipathic peptide that the binding of the peptide to GroEL induced hydrophobic surfaces on GroEL (26Brazil B.T. Cleland J.L. McDowell R.S. Skelton N.J. Paris K. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5105-5111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, ligand-induced exposure of hydrophobic surfaces on GroEL may be a mechanism to present hydrophobic binding surfaces to substrate polypeptide. Furthermore, the interaction of a positively charged protein with GroEL has also been described as an effector of GroEL substrate polypeptide binding (11Itzhaki L.S. Otzen D.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14581-14587Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In that study, it was demonstrated by point mutations within the protein chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 that positive charges on the protein confer tighter binding to GroEL, whereas negative charges on chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 diminish binding (11Itzhaki L.S. Otzen D.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14581-14587Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).It has been demonstrated in this study that hydrophobic surface(s) on GroEL can be significantly increased upon the addition of divalent cations. The fluorescent probes bis-ANS, Nile Red, and TNS were used to demonstrate that additions of divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+) but not monovalent cations (K+ and Na+) result in an increase in the fluorescence intensity of each probe. The presence of hydrophobic surfaces on GroEL was also measured by the non-fluorescent method using octyl-Sepharose (Fig. 3). The results of that experiment also demonstrate an increase in GroEL hydrophobic surfaces in the presence of divalent cations. This indicates that, independent of the method of hydrophobic measurements, the effects of divalent cations on GroEL hydrophobic surface exposure still occur. One of the most interesting findings in this study is the contribution of Zn2+ in strengthening GroEL substrate binding and increasing the efficiency of substrate release upon the addition of MgATP and GroES.Magnesium has been previously shown to stabilize the quaternary structure of GroEL (12Azem A. Diamant S. Goloubinoff P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6671-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Gorovits B.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28551-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The present work shows that zinc does not stabilize the GroEL quaternary structure (Fig. 4), but it does appear to influence the secondary structure of GroEL (Fig. 5). In contrast, there was no detectable change in the GroEL secondary structure in the presence of magnesium (data not shown). These results suggest that Zn2+ binding can affect the secondary structure in a region that does not significantly contribute to the global stability of GroEL as reported by the methods used in this study.Thus, it appears that interactions with divalent cations can modulate the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces presented by GroEL, with Zn2+ being the most effective. It is possible that GroEL has a low affinity metal binding site (12Azem A. Diamant S. Goloubinoff P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6671-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or that the divalent cations act in a more general fashion by shielding the negative charge on GroEL. For example, due to the high net negative charge on GroEL (−266 per 14-mer), it may be that cationic interactions of salts and/or cationic amphipathic secondary structure on substrate polypeptides are required for a coordinated exposure of buried hydrophobic binding sites on GroEL. Thus, the binding of divalent cations to GroEL may be a way of fine-tuning the exposure of hydrophobic residues for the binding of unfolded substrate polypeptides. GroEL binds a variety of polypeptides in their non-native states (3Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F.X. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 20Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5665-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). This implies that the primary sequence of a substrate polypeptide does not supply the information required for recognition. Thus, binding must occur by a more general mechanism of molecular recognition. A common feature of unfolded and misfolded polypeptides is the solvent exposure of hydrophobic residues that would be buried in the native state. It is generally accepted that GroEL polypeptide interactions occur by hydrophobic association. Several studies have described these interactions and stated the importance of GroEL hydrophobic binding of substrate polypeptides (8Lin Z. Schwarz F.P. Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1011-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 22Zahn R. Axmann S.E. Rucknagel K.P. Jaeger E. Laminet A.A. Pluckthun A. J. Mol.

The GroEL crystal structure (24Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar), complemented by GroEL mutational analysis (9Fenton W.A. Kasha Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), has made it possible to suggest the substrate polypeptide binding sites on GroEL. These sites are within flexible segments containing hydrophobic residues in the apical domains of the GroEL 14-mer. However, when hydrophobic surfaces on unliganded GroEL are probed with bis-ANS, only a few molecules of bis-ANS bind per GroEL 14-mer (10Horowitz P.M. Hua S. Gibbons D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1535-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This result raises an interesting question. If GroEL substrate polypeptide binding occurs by hydrophobic association in the apical domains of GroEL, where are all the hydrophobic sites on GroEL? The answer to this question may be that hydrophobic sites on GroEL are buried until the appropriate ligands signal their exposure. For example, several studies have demonstrated that GroEL quaternary structure changes after the addition of adenine nucleotides and divalent cations (12Azem A. Diamant S. Goloubinoff P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6671-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Saibil H.R. Zheng D. Roseman A.M. Hunter A.S. Watson G.M.F. Chen S. auf der Mauer A. O'Hara B.P. Wood S.P. Mann N.H.

To dissect the amino acid contacts important for receptor-specific ligand recognition, a series of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) mutants were constructed. Transcriptional studies revealed that serine 232 (Ser232) in RARα and methionine 272 (Met272) in RARγ are critical residues for the recognition of their respective receptor-selective analogs.The identification of these key amino acids in the ligand binding pocket is confirmed by the reported crystal structure of RARγ. Interestingly, the serine at position 232 in RARα gives an explanation for the observed differences in the affinity of the naturally occurring ligand, all-trans-retinoic acid (t-RA), in this receptor compared with that for the other receptors, since hydrogen bonding would not be permitted between the hydroxyl of serine and the hydrophobic linker of t-RA. Using this model, a molecular mechanism for the transcriptional antagonism of a synthetic analog is suggested that involves an alteration in the structure of the receptor protein in the region around the AF2 domain in helix 12.

Retinoic acid and its analogs (retinoids) regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation in higher eukaryotes. The biological effects of these ligands are mediated by their binding to the retinoic acid receptors (RARs), 1The abbreviation used are: RAR, retinoic acid receptor; t-RA, all-trans-retinoic acid; LBD, ligand binding domain; AM-580, 4-[(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthyl)carboxamide]benzoic acid; BMS-185411, 4[[[5,6-dihydro-5,5-dimethyl-8-phenyl-2-naphthalenyl]-carbonyl]amino]benzoic acid; BMS-185354, (E, Z)-6[(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)hydroxyiminomethyl]-2-naphthalenecarboxylic acid. which are members of the superfamily of steroid-thyroid hormone nuclear receptors. These receptors act as transcriptional enhancers that bind in a sequence-specific manner to their response elements (retinoic acid response elements) located within the promoter region of distinct retinoid-responsive genes. RARs activate transcription of those genes after ligand bound to the receptor induces conformational changes leading to activation (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B.

A crystal structure of the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the closely related human retinoid-X receptor α revealed a novel protein fold, an antiparallel α-helical sandwich, common to the members of this superfamily. Examination of this structure for a potential binding pocket for its ligand, 9-cis-retinoic acid, unveiled two large hydrophobic cavities within the N-terminal portion of the LBD in the vicinity of the s1,s2 β-hairpin and α-helix H5 (5Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). These findings are supported by results from ligand-photoaffinity binding experiments, which identified important residues for receptor-ligand binding in the LDBs of the glucocorticoid receptor (6Stromstedt P.E. Berkenstam A. Jornvall H. Gustafsson J.A. Carlstedt-Duke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12973-12977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and RARα (7Sasaki T. Shimazawa R. Sawada T. Jijima T.

Shudo K. Hashimoto Y. Iwasaki S. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1996; 19: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence alignment of the nuclear receptor LBDs indicates that most of the residues identified by photoaffinity labeling or site-directed mutagenesis correspond to the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor residues surrounding the putative 9-cis-retinoic acid binding pocket (9Wurth J.-M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.-P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Recently, the 2.0-Å structure of the LBD of human RARγ bound to all-trans-retinoic acid (t-RA) was reported showing details of ligand-receptor interactions (10Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Several amino acids from α-helices H1, H3, H5, H11, H12, loops 6–7 and 11–12, and serine 289 (Ser289) from the β-sheet s1 were proposed as contact residues between the receptor and ligand. Amino acid sequence alignment of RARα, -β, and -γ revealed that among all of these residues, only three positions were variable: serine 232 (Ser232), alanine 225 (Ala225), and alanine 234 (Ala234) in H3, isoleucine 270 (Ile270), isoleucine 263 (Ile263), and methionine 272 (Met272) in H5 and valine 395 (Val395), valine 388 (Val388), and alanine 397 (Ala397) in H11. These amino acid residues therefore became obvious candidates as crucial amino acids responsible for determining RAR selectivity to certain synthetic analogs of t-RA. Utilizing site-directed mutagenesis and RAR-selective retinoids, we previously identified serine 232 (Ser232) and threonine 239 (Thr239) from the N-terminal portion of the LBD of RARα and the corresponding alanine 225 (Ala225) and isoleucine 232 (Ile225) from RARβ to be essential for the recognition of retinoic acid and various analogs (11Ostrowski J. Hammer L. Roalsvig T. Pokornowski K. Reczek P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1812-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the present work, the amide linker region of Am-580 and the oxime linker region of BMS-185354 were used to precisely identify serine 232 (Ser232) in RARα and methionine 272 (Met272) in RARγ as critical for the specific interaction of the receptor and retinoid. Experiments with an RARα antagonist, BMS-185411, showed that Ser232 is also involved in the transcriptional antagonist activity of this compound. In RARβ, an alanine (Ala225) at the position corresponding to Ser232 in RARα was shown to allow BMS-185411 to behave as an RARβ-specific agonist. Analysis of several additional RARα- or RARγ-specific point mutants introduced along α-helix H3, H4/H5 and the Ω loop of RARβ detected a decrease in the transactivation activity of BMS-185411. The amino acids mutated in these experiments, according to the crystal model of RARγ LBD, do not directly interact with t-RA. This suggests that the effect of these residues on the potency and selectivity of BMS-185411 could be due to intramolecular interactions within the receptor itself. These findings support the conclusion that the transcriptionally active ligand-receptor complex is a result of a series of direct and indirect interactions between the receptor and its selective ligand, which reflect the dynamic nature of both components.

DNA fragments synthesized by polymerase chain reaction were cloned directly into pRARα0 using a combination of theBstEII, BsgI, and BclI cloning sites found in RARα. The corresponding cloning sites, which are not present in RARβ cDNA, were introduced into DNA amplified from this receptor using synthetic amplification primers. Amplification and recombinant primers were made using the Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Gene Assembler-4. To construct the chimera RARα(E)β, the BsgI site at position 1194 in RARβ was removed using a similar protocol. Transfection of HeLa cells with DNA encoding wild type RARα, RARβ, and the various chimeric receptors was performed as described (11Ostrowski J. Hammer L. Roalsvig T. Pokornowski K. Reczek P.R. Proc.

Retinoid efficacy was measured by the concentration of induced chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene product obtained from transfected cells using the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). Activity was routinely normalized for transfection efficiency by β-galactosidase activity. Results (EC50) are presented as the dose at which chloramphenicol acetyltransferase induction was half of the level observed for t-RA at 10−6m. To evaluate antagonist activity of test retinoids, a transactivation competition assay was used. Transfected HeLa cells were treated 16 h with 10−7m t-RA, with or without BMS-185411 at concentrations of 10−8 to 10−5m. These cells were then harvested and crude extracts prepared. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase protein level was assayed as described above. The antagonist activity of BMS-185411 is measured as an IC50 for the inhibition of transactivation produced by t-RA. Binding of synthetic ligands to the receptors was accomplished by a competition binding assay described in Ref. 11Ostrowski J. Hammer L. Roalsvig T. Pokornowski K. Reczek P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1812-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar. DNA sequence analysis and protein structure predictions were performed using GeneWorks 2.3 DNA-protein analysis software from IntelliGenetics, Inc. Wild type RARα, -β, and -γ transiently transfected into HeLa cells were used to establish the profile of receptor-specific transactivation responses utilizing t-RA and the receptor-selective synthetic retinoids Am-580, BMS-185411, and BMS-185354 (Fig. 1). In these experiments, Am-580 was found to be an RARα-selective agonist, displaying an EC50of 3.2 nm for this receptor. BMS-185411 showed specific agonist activity for RARβ with an EC50 of 34 nm, and BMS-185354 selectively activated RARγ with an EC50 of 28 nm (Table I).Table IResults of retinoid transactivation assayView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Open table in a new tab Utilizing the chimeric RAR, RARα(nE)β, where the N-terminal portion of RARβ domain E was subcloned into an RARα background by polymerase chain reaction-assisted site-directed mutagenesis, two sets of residues, serine 232 (Ser232)/alanine 225 (Ala225) and threonine 239 (Thr239)/isoleucine 232 (Ile232) in RARα and RARβ were found to be essential for receptor-ligand-specific interactions (11Ostrowski J. Hammer L. Roalsvig T. Pokornowski K. Reczek P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1812-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Further investigation of the role of each residue alone was accomplished by a second series of mutants, RARα(nE-S225)β, RARα(nE-T232)β, RARα(nE-S232)β, and RARβ(S225). In the RARα(nE-S225)β mutant, alanine 225 in RARα(nE)β was substituted by a serine as found in RARα (Fig. 2). In transactivation experiments, the RARα-selective agonist, Am-580, activated RARα(nE-S225)β with a profile similar to wild type RARα, with an EC50 of 2.5 nm. Both the RARβ-selective agonist, BMS-185411, and the RARγ-selective agonist, BMS-185354, showed little or no transactivation activity with this mutant (Table I). These results suggested that Ser232 in RARα is the residue that is primarily responsible for this receptor's characteristic activities with selective retinoids like Am-580, which contains an amide linker. This conclusion was further supported by results of transactivation experiments with Am-580 and RARα(nE-T232)β, where isoleucine 232 (Ile232) in RARα(nE)β was replaced by the threonine found in RARα (Fig. 2). This substitution did not alter the transactivation profile observed for the double mutant, RARα(nE-S225/T232)β, or the single mutant, RARα(nE-S225)β, indicating that only the serine residue at position 225 is responsible for interaction with the amide linker of Am-580 (Table I). In addition, substitution of isoleucine 232 (Ile232) by serine instead of threonine (mutant RARα(nE-S232)β) showed an activity profile identical to that of the wild type RARβ, indicating that addition of a second serine at this position will not alter the transactivation selectivity for Am-580. Finally, analysis of a single point mutant of RARβ, RARβ(S225), showed that the single amino acid substitution of alanine 225 (Ala225) by serine resulted in a mutant receptor that responded to both t-RA and Am-580 with an identical profile to wild type RARα and showed only weak transactivation with the RARγ-selective, BMS-185354 (Table I). The EC50 of 1.8 nm for Am-580 with RARβ(S225) verified that Ser232 in RARα is the only amino acid which selectively interacts with the amide linker of the compound. Examination of amino acid differences among RARα, -β, and -γ within the first 100 residues of the N-terminal portion of domain E revealed only a limited number of amino acid differences (Fig. 2). These suggested that the receptor chimera, RARα(nE)β, could be used as a host to create five constructs targeted to identify the amino acids involved in specific RARγ-ligand interactions. In a series of transactivation experiments, neither the RARβ arginine 212 substitution with RARγ glutamine (Gln212) (RARα(nE-Q212)β) nor the RARβ isoleucine 246 substitution with RARγ serine (Ser246) alone (RARα(nE-S246)β) or in combination (RARα(nE-Q212/S246)β) was sufficient to convert a ligand-selective response from the RARβ type into the RARγ type using the RARγ-selective BMS-185354. This suggests that both Gln212 and Ser246 are not contact amino acids between RARγ and its selective ligand (Table I). The replacement of the RARβ isoleucine 263 (Ile263) by methionine, which corresponds to the RARγ methionine 272 (Met272) (Fig. 2), resulted in chimera RARα(nE-Q212/S246/M263)β. In transactivation experiments, all three selective retinoids showed an EC50for this mutant receptor similar to that for the wild type RARγ (Table I). This suggests that the methionine may be responsible for the RARγ-specific interactions observed in this class of receptor-selective ligand. The results of experiments with RARα(nE-M263)β, in which a single Ile263 to methionine substitution effectively converted the chimeric receptor to an RARγ isotype, confirms this conclusion. Both Am-580 and BMS-185354 showed an EC50 for the single mutant similar to that for wild type RARγ (Table I). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that a single isoleucine-methionine substitution is sufficient to convert the chimeric receptor, RARα(nE)β, which shows an RARβ-specific type of transactivation, into a receptor with an RARγ-specific type of transactivation. Analysis of the results of transactivation experiments revealed that BMS-185411 acts as an RARβ-specific agonist with an EC50 of 34 and 54 nm for the wild type and chimeric RARα(nE)β receptors, respectively (Table I). In competition assays, however, this retinoid behaved as a specific antagonist for RARα, displaying an IC50 of 400 nm (Table II). Furthermore, BMS-185411 is an antagonist for the mutants RARα/β(nE)α and RARα(nE-S225/T232)β, as well as for the chimeric receptors RARα(nE-S225)β and RARβ(S225) with IC50 values of 233, 220, 217, and 433 nm, respectively (Table II). The antagonist activity seen with RARα(nE-S225)β and RARβ(S225) suggested that the Ser232 residue in RARα must also be involved in antagonist activity and selectivity. This conclusion is further supported by the results of competition experiments using RARα(nE-T232)β in which BMS-185411 did not act as an antagonist (Table II). Based on these results, we conclude that Ser232 in RARα and Ala225 in RARβ are both selective contact amino acids which are responsible for both agonist and antagonist selectivity for the synthetic retinoids used in this report.Table IIResults of retinoic acid competition assay Open table in a new tab The retinoic acid receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in cell growth, differentiation, and development. Yet, despite the large number of biological activities mediated by the receptors, relatively little is known about the precise interaction of the receptor protein and its naturally occurring ligand, t-RA. This study was undertaken to clarify the role of some of the amino acid contacts that were described in a previous report (11Ostrowski J. Hammer L. Roalsvig T. Pokornowski K. Reczek P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1812-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and identified in the x-ray crystal structure (10Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). In our previous report, two amino acid residues from the N-terminal region of the LBD, Ser232 and Thr239 in RARα, and the corresponding Ala225 and Ile232 in RARβ, were shown to be critical for receptor-specific interactions with t-RA and various receptor-selective retinoids (11Ostrowski J. Hammer L. Roalsvig T. Pokornowski K. Reczek P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1812-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here, further analysis of these key amino acids using site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Ser232 in RARα and Met272 in RARγ (Fig. 2) are critical for receptor-selective ligand interactions. The serine residue interacts with the amide linker portion of Am-580 in RARα, and the methionine residue interacts with the oxime linker in an RARα-selective retinoid (Fig. 3). Defined in this way, these receptor-selective contact amino acids are located in the ligand binding pocket and must modulate the binding of naturally occurring retinoids as well. Using the results generated here for synthetic ligands, Ser232 in RARα may participate in a hydrogen bond with the amide linker of Am-580 and its analogs, which links the compound to α-helix H3 (Fig. 3). In RARβ and RARγ, alanine residues at positions 225 and 234, respectively, correspond to Ser232in RARα. The presence of a hydrophilic linker, as seen in Am-580, in close proximity to a hydrophobic amino acid (Ala225 or Ala234) may result in negative interactions between the receptor and retinoid manifested as decreased affinity of the compound for both RARβ and γ (Fig. 3 and Table III). In contrast, mutant receptors containing Thr239 alone were found to have no effect on the activity of the RARα-selective agonist, Am-580, and its analogs (Table I). This finding is supported by the results of experiments with the chimeric receptor RARα(nE-S232)β, where the Thr239was substituted by serine.Table IIIThe apparent Kd for the binding of retinoids tested in this study using wild type RARα, RARβ, and RARγ Open table in a new tab The strategy outlined above was also used for the identification of RARγ-selective amino acid contacts with receptor-selective ligands. Several mutant receptors were made, particularly an isoleucine 263 substitution for methionine in RARα(nE)β, which produced RARα(nE-M263)β. This mutation was found to be completely sufficient to convert the RARβ type of response of RARα(nE)β with BMS-185354 into the RARγ type. Therefore, it is likely that the methionine residue at position 272 is exclusively responsible for the RARγ selectivity of BMS-185354 (Table I). Methionine is generally considered to be a hydrophobic amino acid. However, the presence of a sulfur atom in the side chain of this amino acid could account for weak hydrogen bonding (18Stickle D., F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 226: 1143-1159Crossref Scopus (397) Google Scholar) between this amino acid and the hydroxyl substituent of BMS-185354 (Fig. 1 and compound 2 in Ref. 11Ostrowski J. Hammer L. Roalsvig T. Pokornowski K. Reczek P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1812-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the overall strong hydrophobic properties of methionine can also explain why there is only a moderate negative effect of RARγ-selective retinoids on RARβ, which contains an isoleucine residue at a position corresponding to Met272 (Figs. 2 and 3). These observations are supported by conclusions from the crystal structure of RARγ, where interactions between Met272 and t-RA were proposed (10Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). The Met272 is located on α-helix H5 (Fig. 2), which, according to the model from x-ray analysis, lies above the ligand (10Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). This arrangement also explains the results of experiments where the racemate (R,S)1 of 6-(5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthyl)hydroxymethyl-2-naphthalene carboxylic acid and both its purified S-1 and R-1 enantiomers were used (19Reczek P.R. Ostrowski J. Yu K.L. Chen S. Hammer L. Roalsvig T. Starrett J.E. Driscoll J.P. Whiting G. Spinazze P.G. Tramposch K.M. Mansuri M.M. Skin Pharmacol. 1995; 8: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All three compounds showed RARγ selectivity with the S-1 enantiomer being 10-fold more potent than R-1. In this enantiomer, the hydroxyl group is more favorably positioned with respect to Met272 and, thus, Met272 appears to be the only amino acid required for receptor-specific recognition. Recently, another group of synthetic retinoids were discovered that act to reverse the effect of retinoic acid in transactivation assays. BMS-185411 is an example of such a transcriptional antagonist, which is shown here to interact with Ser232 (Table II). We propose that the hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of Ser232and the amide linker of BMS-185411 positions this compound adjacent to α-helix H3 and may also force the phenyl group of this compound into close proximity to α-helix H12, which is important for transactivation activity (Fig. 3) (21Green S. Chambon P. Trends Genet. 1988; 4: 309-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 22Nagpal S. Friant S. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of RARγ suggests that when t-RA binds to the receptor, α-helix-H12 closes the entry opening by swinging upward and interacting with α-helix-H4 (10Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar, 17Lupisella J.A. Driscoll J.E. Metzler W., J. Reczek P.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22969-22975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The α-helix-H12 is then stabilized in this position by a salt bridge between glutamic acid 412 (Glu412) from H12 and lysine 264 (Lys264) from α-helix-H4 (10Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Modeling studies of the receptor with this ligand suggest that the phenyl ring of BMS-185411 may interfere with the proper alignment of α-helix-H12 leading to the inactivation of this receptor, possibly by interfering with the function of the AF-2 transactivation domain. In RARβ, the lack of the hydrogen bond between alanine 225 and the amide linker of BMS-185411 may permit flexibility of the compound in the ligand binding pocket of this receptor thus avoiding interference with α-helix-H12 and leading to selective agonist activity (Fig. 3 and Table I). A similar explanation could also be applied to RARγ, which contains an alanine residue in a position corresponding to RARβ-Ala225 and a methionine at position 272. Using the RARα(nE-M263)β mutant, BMS-185411 was approximately 10–15-fold less potent than the same compound with RARα(nE)β or wild type RARβ (Table I). This suggests that when BMS-185411 moves within the ligand binding pocket to avoid conflict with the α-helix-H12, the dimethyl groups from the tetramethyltetrahydoxynaphthalene portion of the compound interact with α-helix-H5 at position Met272(Fig. 3). The corresponding Ile263 in RARβ is smaller and more hydrophobic than methionine; therefore, it can better accommodate hydrophobic dimethyl groups in its vicinity allowing for more potent agonist activity with RARβ (Table I). The results obtained here for synthetic ligands can be used to explain the pattern of binding observed for the naturally occurring ligand of these receptors, t-RA. When bound to RARβ, t-RA encounters an entirely hydrophobic environment (Fig. 4), which is reflected in the low apparent Kd with Ile263 and Ala225 at the two key positions (Table III). In RARγ, t-RA encounters Met272, a partial hydrophobic residue, and Ala234 at these two positions giving an intermediate apparent Kd. Finally, in RARα, an Ile270 and Ser232 generates hydrophilic character in the binding pocket and increases the apparentKd accordingly. In summary, these results suggest that ligands interact with the amino acids in the ligand binding pocket in a manner that involves subtle positioning between the top of the pocket, represented by the methionine at position 272, and the bottom of the pocket. Our studies with both receptor-selective agonists and antagonists suggest that the interaction between RARs and their selective retinoids has a dynamic nature where both protein as well as ligand affect the final conformation to form a transcriptionally active complex. The functional analysis detailed here provides experimental confirmation of the RARγ LBD x-ray crystal structure. In addition, the identification of specific amino acid contacts within the ligand binding pocket can be exploited for the design of compounds of pharmacologic importance aimed at increasing the biological response and eliminating unwanted side effects.

The vacuole of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an acidic compartment surrounded by a lipid bilayer. Vacuoles contain a variety of soluble and membrane-bound proteolytic enzymes and are considered to be equivalent to the lysosome of higher eukaryotes (1van den Hazel H.B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The proteolytic processes in the vacuole play an important role when the cells are under nutritional stress. The vacuole is also responsible for the degradation of overexpressed proteins, normal cellular proteins, and some abnormal proteins (2Jones E.W. Murdock D.G. Ciechanover A.L. Schwartz A.L. Cellular Proteolytic Systems. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1994: 115-134Google Scholar).

FBPase is rapidly degraded when fresh glucose is added to the glucose-starved yeast cells (3Gancedo C. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 107: 401-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FBPase is targeted from the cytosol to the vacuole for degradation in response to glucose (4Chiang H.-L. Schekman R.

The degradation of FBPase is dependent on the PEP4 gene encoding proteinase A, which is necessary for the activation of proteinase B and C (6Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7963-7966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, the deletion of the PEP4 gene reduces the vacuolar proteolytic activity to 30% that of the wild type level (6Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7963-7966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In thepep4 deletion strain, FBPase is found in the vacuole when glucose-starved cells are transferred to fresh glucose (4Chiang H.-L. Schekman R.

For instance, carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) is synthesized and processed sequentially in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi. CPY is sorted in the late Golgi by the CPY receptor and is delivered to the vacuole through the prevacuolar/endosomal compartment (13Marcusson E.G. Horadovsky B.F. Cereghino J.L. Gharakhanian E.

In contrast, targeting of vacuolar aminopeptidase I and α-mannosidase to the vacuole is independent of the secretory pathway (15Harding T.M. Hefner-Gravink A. Thumm M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol.

However, targeting of cytosolic proteins into the yeast vacuole has not been reconstituted in vitro. To investigate the pathway of FBPase degradation, we reconstitutedin vitro FBPase targeting into the vacuole using permeabilized yeast cells incubated with radiolabeled FBPase, an ATP regenerating system, and cytosolic proteins. The import is a saturable process and is stimulated by glucose. Import of radiolabeled FBPase into semi-intact cells is competed by excess unlabeled FBPase but not a control protein. The imported FBPase accumulates to a higher level in the pep4 cell, suggesting that FBPase is targeted to the vacuole for degradation. Immunofluorescence microscopic studies show that the imported FBPase is localized to the vacuole. Thus, thisin vitro system reconstitutes glucose-induced targeting of FBPase into the vacuole and provides a functional assay to identify molecules required for the FBPase targeting and degradation pathway. S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were HLY193 (Matα his3-Δ200 ura3–52 leu2, 3–112 trp1 FBP1::LEU2) and HLY205 (Matα his3-Δ200 ura3–52 leu2, 3–112 trp1 FBP1::LEU2 PEP4::TRP1). All the chemicals, unless otherwise noted, were obtained from Sigma or ICN Biochemicals Inc. YPD was a complete medium (10 g/liter Bacto yeast extract, 20 g/liter Bacto peptone; Difco) supplemented with 20 g/liter dextrose (Fisher) and was used to induce FBPase degradation. Synthetic minimal medium contained 6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids supplemented with 5 g/liter casamino acids, 40 mg/liter adenine, 60 mg/liter leucine, and 20 g/liter dextrose. YPKG was the FBPase-inducing medium and contained 10 g/liter Bacto yeast extract, 20 g/liter Bacto peptone, 10 g/liter potassium acetate, and 5 g/liter dextrose. 35S-Protein labeling mix ([35S]methionine, 1,175 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. The FBPase expression plasmid (AU125) was a gift from Dr. David T. Rogers (43Rogers D.T. Hiller E. Mitsock L. Orr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6051-6057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-FBPase and rabbit anti-CPY polyclonal antibodies were raised by Berkeley Antibody Company using purified FBPase and CPY (Sigma). The FBPase expression plasmid AU125 (43Rogers D.T. Hiller E. Mitsock L. Orr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6051-6057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was introduced into S. cerevisiae strains by lithium acetate transformation (44Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transformed cells overexpressing the FBPase gene were grown overnight at 30 °C in the uracil- and methionine-free synthetic medium (without ammonium sulfate) containing 20 g/liter dextrose and 10 mCi/liter of 35S-methionine. The radiolabeled FBPase was purified according to the procedure described by Rittenhouse et al. (45Rittenhouse J. Harrsch P.B. Kim J.N. Marcus F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3939-3943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that P11 column was omitted. FBPase was the major protein band (∼80% that of the total proteins) on the Coomassie Blue-stained gels. The protein concentrations from these preparations were 5–10 mg/ml as determined by Bio-Rad Dc protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The specific activity was 4–7 × 104cpm/μg of the protein. The enzyme was stored at −70 °C in small aliquots. For antibody production, the FBPase-overexpressing cells were grown in synthetic minimal medium overnight, and FBPase was purified as described (45Rittenhouse J. Harrsch P.B. Kim J.N. Marcus F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3939-3943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae cells (2,000 A 600 nm/liter culture) were grown in YPKG for 2 days at 30 °C. Cells were harvested and resuspended in YPD and incubated at 30 °C for different periods of time. At the end of the incubation, cells were chilled by adding ice water, collected by centrifugation (1,500 ×g, 5 min) at 4 °C, and washed once with water. Spheroplasts were prepared as described previously (4Chiang H.-L. Schekman R. Nature. 1991; 350: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and collected by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 2 min). Spheroplasts were washed with ice-cold sorbitol buffer (1 m sorbitol, 150 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 6.6) once, resuspended in the same buffer to 50–100 A 600 nm/ml, and stored at −70 °C in small aliquots. Semi-intact cells were freshly prepared as described (33Vida T.A. Graham T.R. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2871-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Spheroplasts (50 A 600 nm) were thawed at 30 °C for 1 min, and 1 ml of buffer A (0.25 msorbitol, 150 mm potassium acetate, 5 mmmagnesium acetate, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 6.6, and 200 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added. Mixtures were incubated on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 1 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A, incubated on ice for 5 min, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 1 min. Semi-intact cells were obtained by repeating the treatment once with buffer A, buffer B (0.05 m sorbitol, 150 mmpotassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 6.6, and 200 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and buffer A, respectively. Semi-intact cells were resuspended in the import buffer (0.4 m sorbitol, 150 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 6.6) at 60 A 600 nm/ml. The same yeast cells as those described above for the preparation of semi-intact cells were grown, cultured, and harvested under the same conditions described above. Cells were resuspended in 1 cell volume of import buffer supplemented with 200 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 volumes of ice-chilled glass beads (0.45–0.50 mm) were added. The mixture was vortexed at the highest speed for 1 min and chilled on ice for 5 min. The vortexing procedure was repeated 5 times. Usually, more than 90% of the cells were disrupted as examined by light microscopy. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (500 × g, 5 min). The supernatant was clarified by centrifugation (150,000 ×g, 2 h) and stored at −70 °C in small aliquots. The protein concentrations in these preparations were 10–20 mg/ml. This high speed supernatant is referred to as cytosol. The semi-intact cells and cytosol were prepared from the same cells. In a typical experiment, the reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 3 A 600 nmunits of semi-intact cells, 0.5 mg/ml cytosolic proteins, an ATP regenerating system (0.5 mm ATP, 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 40 mm creatine phosphate), and 11 μg of 35S-FBPase in the import buffer. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. At the end of incubation, 0.8 mg/ml proteinase K (final concentration) with or without 2% Triton X-100 was added to the reactions (50 μl of proteinase K solution containing 2.4 mg/ml proteinase K, 100 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA with or without 6% Triton X-100). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and the reaction was terminated by adding 1 ml of 15% w/v trichloroacetic acid solution. Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was washed once with ice-cold acetone and resuspended in 200 μl of SDS loading buffer. The proteins (15 μl) were then resolved on SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and analyzed by a Fuji FUJIX BAS 1000 Bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Medical Systems). Alternatively, proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) for immunoblotting. FBPase and CPY were detected by anti-FBPase and anti-CPY antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) immunoblotting procedure (46Hoffman M. Chiang H-L. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The import of FBPase was defined as the fraction of FBPase that was protected from proteinase K digestion in the absence of Triton X-100 but was sensitive to proteinase K in the presence of the detergent. In general, 20–40% of import could be achieved in thein vitro system. The semi-intact cells were treated with proteinase K at the end of import reactions. Semi-intact cells were collected by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 20–30 s) and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer C (100 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA). Cells were fixed and stained with anti-FBPase antibody as described previously (4Chiang H.-L. Schekman R. Nature. 1991; 350: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were fixed with 7% formaldehyde for 40 min at room temperature, washed twice with 0.5 ml of 1.2 m sorbitol and incubated with pre-absorbed rabbit anti-FBPase antibodies (1:20 dilution) overnight and with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies for 1 h. Cells were visualized by Nomarski optics, and FBPase was detected by immunofluorescence using Zeiss Axiophot microscopy. Images were analyzed with the Northern Exposure and Adobe Photoshop softwares. To reconstitute FBPase import into the vacuole, we prepared semi-intact cells from the pep4 and fbp1 deletion strain. The deletion of the endogenous FBPase gene (FBP1) was necessary to introduce radiolabeled FBPase exogenously. The pep4 deletion strain reduces the vacuolar proteolytic activity to 30% that of the wild type level and allowed FBPase to accumulate to a higher level and hence facilitated the detection of the import process. The overall strategy to reconstitutein vitro import of FBPase is illustrated in Fig. 1. The semi-intact cells, unless otherwise noted, were prepared from the Δpep4Δfbp1(HLY205) yeast cells that were grown to induce FBPase and then transferred to medium containing fresh glucose for 20 min. Semi-intact cells were prepared from the double deletion strain by removing cell walls to produce spheroplasts, followed by slow freeze and thaw and treating with hypotonic buffer. This releases soluble proteins and small molecules into the medium and still preserves the integrity of most organelles in a functional state (25Baker D. Hicke L. Rexach M. Schleyer M. Schekman R. Cell. 1988; 54: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we introduced purified, radiolabeled FBPase into semi-intact cells and followed the fate of radiolabeled FBPase in the permeabilized cells. We first determined whether FBPase was imported into a proteinase K-resistant compartment in the permeabilized cells in vitro. In the standard import conditions, the total FBPase, which consisted of both imported and nonimported FBPase, migrated at 38 kDa on the SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). To distinguish the FBPase that was imported in a membrane-sealed compartment from the FBPase that was not, we added proteinase K to digest the free FBPase after the import had occurred. This treatment produced two species of FBPase; the full-length 38-kDa FBPase and the smaller sized 30-kDa FBPase (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). The 38-kDa FBPase represented the FBPase that was protected in a membrane-sealed compartment, since it was sensitive to proteinase K digestion when Triton X-100 was added (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). By contrast, the 30-kDa FBPase was produced only after proteinase K was added to the reactions in the absence of ATP and cytosol (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). Quantitative analysis indicated that more than 98% of the full-length FBPase was converted to 30 kDa by proteinase K treatment under this condition (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). Since the 30-kDa FBPase was resistant to proteinase K digestion, even in the presence of Triton X-100 (Fig. 2 A, lane 4), it represented the FBPase that was not protected in a membrane-sealed compartment and served as an internal control. We monitored the amounts of CPY in these reactions. CPY was present as p2 form in the pep4 cell (Fig. 2 A, lane 1, 69 kDa). The p2-CPY was resistant to proteinase K treatment in the absence of Triton X-100 (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and 3). It was cleaved to a lower molecular weight species (∼67 kDa) when Triton X-100 was added. This 67-kDa CPY was not further cleaved to smaller fragments when increasing amounts of proteinase K were added in the presence of Triton X-100 (not shown), suggesting that the 67-kDa CPY was the end product of proteinase K treatment in this in vitro system. We used the conversion of CPY from 69 kDa to 67 kDa in the presence of Triton X-100 to monitor the efficacy of proteinase K digestion in the in vitroreactions. We determined the time course of the import process. Total FBPase was defined as the sum of the 38-kDa plus the 30-kDa FBPase in each reaction. The percentage of import was defined as the fraction of 38 kDa divided by the total FBPase. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the total amounts of the 30-kDa plus the 38-kDa FBPase were not significantly changed during the import reactions. We found that the amount of the full-length 38-kDa FBPase was 1–2% that of the total FBPase at the import time = 0 min (Fig. 2 B). The amounts increased after 10 or 30 min of import and decreased after import for 45 and 60 min. The kinetics of FBPase import is similar to that shown in Fig. 5 C. Under the same conditions, the amounts of p2-CPY were not significantly altered within 60 min of the import process, suggesting that the vacuole was stable during the import reactions (Fig. 2 B). FBPase is imported into the vacuole as an intact form because the full-length FBPase is recovered from purified vacuoles (4Chiang H.-L. Schekman R. Nature. 1991; 350: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In thisin vitro system, the 38-kDa FBPase was the species that became resistant to proteinase K in a time-dependent manner, whereas the 30-kDa was not (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, the sequestration of the 38-kDa FBPase in a membrane-sealed compartment was used as an indication of the import process that occurred in thein vitro system. We routinely obtained 20–40% of FBPase import in our standard in vitro conditions. To quantitate the amount of the 38-kDa FBPase that was sequestered inside the membrane-sealed compartment, we titrated the amounts of proteinase K in the absence or presence of Triton X-100. The semi-intact cells were incubated with 35S-FBPase, cytosol, and an ATP regenerating system for 20 min, and increasing amounts of proteinase K were added after the reactions. Fig. 2 C shows that in the absence of Triton X-100, approximately 30–40% of the total FBPase was resistant to proteinase K over the concentration ranges from 0.1 to 1.6 mg/ml. At a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K, essentially all the FBPase was digested when Triton X-100 was added to solubilize the membranes. At higher concentrations of proteinase K, the percentage of FBPase that was resistant to proteinase K was not changed. These results suggest that, at these concentrations, the fraction of FBPase that was resistant to proteinase K reflected the FBPase that was sequestered inside a membranous compartment. Since 0.4, 0.8, or 1.6 mg/ml proteinase K was sufficient to digest most of the free FBPase and unravel the fraction of FBPase that was protected in a membrane-sealed compartment, we added 0.8 mg/ml proteinase K at the end of our in vitro incubations for all the subsequent analysis. In the wild type cell harboring a chromosomal copy of the FBP1 gene, FBPase is degraded with a half-life of 30 min in response to glucose. The degradation of FBPase is retarded if the cells overexpress theFBP1 gene; the half-life of FBPase degradation increases to 60–90 min in such cells (4Chiang H.-L. Schekman R. Nature. 1991; 350: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The dose-dependent increase in the FBPase degradation half-lives suggests that FBPase targeting to the vacuole is a saturable process. We tested whether the import of FBPase was a saturable process in the reconstituted system by incubating semi-intact cells with increasing amounts of radiolabeled FBPase in the absence or presence of an ATP regenerating system and cytosol. As shown in Fig. 3 A, FBPase import was minimal in the absence of ATP, whether or not cytosol was added to the medium. FBPase import increased when ATP was added in the absence of cytosol. FBPase import was the highest when both ATP and cytosol were present in the incubation medium. Quantitation of the results obtained in the presence of ATP and cytosol showed that the import of FBPase increased when the amounts of FBPase were raised from 2.2 to 11 μg (Fig. 3 B). However, when the amount of the exogenous FBPase was increased to 22 μg, the amount of FBPase that was imported within semi-intact cells remained unchanged (Fig. 3 B). Thus, FBPase import is a saturable process. We tested whether the import was specific by incubating 11 μg of radiolabeled FBPase with increasing amounts of unlabeled FBPase and bovine serum albumin. As shown in Fig. 3 C, unlabeled FBPase competed with the import of radiolabeled FBPase into semi-intact cells, whereas bovine serum albumin showed no competition at the same concentrations. We titrated the concentrations of cytosolic proteins and determined the effects of cytosolic proteins in FBPase import in the in vitro system. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the import was very low in the absence of both cytosol and an ATP regenerating system. The addition of 0.5 mm ATP in the absence of cytosol increased FBPase import. The maximal import was found when 0.5 mm ATP was combined with cytosol at the concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. No further increase was seen when the concentration of cytosol was raised to 1 mg/ml. Therefore, cytosol has a synergistic effect on FBPase import and stimulates the import 2–3-folds when combined with ATP in the import reactions. We also determined the optimal concentrations of ATP in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml cytosol in the reconstituted system (Fig. 4 B). As we have already shown, FBPase import did not occur in the absence of ATP. However, the addition of ATP stimulated FBPase import in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 B). The import increa"

Interleukin-1 (IL-1), released primarily from activated macrophages, is a key mediator of effective host defense against microorganisms. We observe that hyperglycemic levels of d-glucose (8–20 mm) inhibit the release of IL-1 by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells. An inhibitor of glucose transport and metabolism, 2-deoxyglucose, prevents this inhibition of IL-1 release. High levels (8–20 mm) of fructose and mannose (but not galactose orl-glucose) also inhibit the release of IL-1 activity, suggesting that metabolism is required for IL-1 inhibition. Immunoprecipitation and activity measurements demonstrate that high glucose levels block the release of IL-1 but do not inhibit IL-1 production. High glucose levels (20 mm) increase protein kinase C (PKC) activity, and inhibitors of PKC block the inhibitory effects of glucose. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, an agonist of PKC, mimics glucose-induced inhibition of IL-1 release. These results demonstrate that high glucose levels inhibit IL-1 release (but not production) by RAW 264.7 murine macrophages, and this inhibition is mediated by PKC activation. These studies suggest that persistent infections in hyperglycemic patients may be due to an inhibition of IL-1 release from macrophages. Diabetic patients with hyperglycemia (high blood glucose) have frequent and persistent bacterial infections linked to significantly diminished bactericidal activity and macrophage function.

These studies suggest that persistent infections in hyperglycemic patients may be due to an inhibition of IL-1 release from macrophages. A major complication in diabetic patients is the frequent occurrence and long duration of bacterial infections (1Smitherman K.O. Peacock J.E. Med. Clin. N.

Three lines of evidence establish high blood glucose levels as a key mediator of decreased bactericidal activity: 1) a strong correlation between high blood glucose levels and the prevalence of infection (4Rayfield E.J.

Med. 1982; 72: 439-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), 2) reversal of high infection rate by normalizing blood glucose levels (5Jones C.A. Seifert M.F. Dixit P.K. Proc.

High glucose concentrations in dialysis fluid correlate with an impairment of anti-bacterial defense in the peritoneal cavity of rats (7Calame W. Hendrickx R.J.B.M. Namavar F. Oe L.P. Beelen R.H. J.

IL-1, a key mediator of the immune response and effective host defense against microorganisms, is produced by macrophages in response to stimulators including bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Activated macrophages have a high rate of glucose uptake (GLUT1 transporter) and glucose utilization (9Bustos R. Sobrino F. Biochem.

The proinflammatory cytokines IL-1α and IL-1β are expressed as 33-kDa precursor proteins that are cleaved intracellularly by cysteine proteases (12Carruth L.M. Demczuk S. Mizel S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12162-12167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kobayashi Y. Yamamoto K. Saido T. Kawasaki H. Oppenheim J.J. Matsushima K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sitia R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Both IL-1α and IL-1β are expressed without leader sequences and are not secreted via the classic endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi apparatus as are many other cytokines (16Miller D.K. Calaycay J.R.

We recently reported that IL-1 is released from macrophages by a novel mechanism mediated by nitric oxide and cGMP (17Hill J.R. Corbett J.A. Kwon G. Marshall C.A. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22672-22679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but the full mechanism of IL-1 secretion is still unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that hyperglycemic glucose levels inhibit IL-1 release but not production by activated RAW 264.7 murine macrophages. This inhibition requires metabolism, is fully reversible upon removal of high glucose, and is mediated by protein kinase C. These findings may offer insight into the causes of diminished bactericidal activity in diabetics and suggest possible interventions for infections.

Cells were removed from T-75 flasks by treatment with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA at 37 °C. The cells were washed and added to microtiter plates at concentrations of 2 × 105 cells/200 μl of CMRL-1066 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5.5 mm glucose (complete CMRL).

Briefly, cell-free culture medium obtained from LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells was added to RINm5F cells (2 × 105 cells/200 μl) at a final dilution of 1:100. Concurrently, a standard curve was performed using hIL-1β at concentrations between 0.1 and 1 unit/ml (10–100 pg). After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2, the culture medium was collected, and nitrite levels were determined. IL-1 concentrations were extrapolated from the standard curve. Nitrite release was determined by mixing 50 μl of culture medium with 50 μl of Griess reagent (1 part 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride in H2O plus 1 part 1.32% sulfanilamide in 60% acetic acid (23Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10881) Google Scholar)) in a 96-well microtiter plate. The absorbance at 540 nm was measured on a Titertek Multiskan MCC/340 plate reader, and nitrite concentrations were calculated from a standard curve using NaNO2 concentrations between 0.1 and 10 nmol. RAW 264.7 cells (1 × 106 cells in 1 ml) in CMRL methionine-deficient medium (9 parts CMRL without methionine:1 part CMRL containing methionine) were activated with LPS (1 μg/ml) in 2 or 20 mm glucose and pulsed for 12 h with 150 μCi of [35S]methionine trans-label. The cells were washed with CMRL and incubated for an additional 12 h (total 24 h) at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2. The supernatant was collected, and cells were removed by centrifugation at 200 × g for 1 min. The cells were washed in PBS and lysed in 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet plus protease inhibitors (aprotinin, 1 μg/ml; leupeptin, 1 μg/ml; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm; iodoacetamide, 1 mm; EDTA, 0.1 mm) by sonication, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C. Protease inhibitors were also added to the supernatant. Both lysate and supernatant were precleared with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose. Equivalent fractions of each sample were immunoprecipitated for 2 h by addition of anti-murine IL-1α (final dilution 1:1000). Protein A-Sepharose was added for 1 h, and the beads were washed three times with PBS + 1% Nonidet + 0.2% SDS and finally PBS and then boiled in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Samples were resolved by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by fluorography. PKC activity was determined as described previously (24Williams B. Schrier R.W. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, RAW 264.7 cells (2 × 105cells/200 μl) were incubated for 4 or 24 h at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2 and collected and washed with PBS. The cells were permeabilized with 50 μg/ml digitonin in buffer (40 μl): 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.3 mm NaPO4, 0.4 mm KPO4, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 5.5 mm glucose, 5 mmEGTA, 1 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, with 1 nm [γ-32P]ATP and 100 μm PKC specific substrate VRKRTLRRL. After 10-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped with trichloroacetic acid (final 5%) and spotted on a phosphocellulose filter (Whatman P-81) and washed with 75 mm phosphoric acid and 75 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5. The filters were counted in a Packard 1500 Tri-carb scintillation counter. Statistical comparisons were made between groups using a one-way analysis of variance with significant differences (p < 0.01) evaluated using a Scheffe's F-test posthoc analysis (Statview V4.0, Abacus Concepts). RAW 264.7 cells (2 × 105/200 μl) were exposed to LPS (1 μg/ml) plus varied glucose concentrations (0–20 mm) for 24 h. Nitrite and IL-1 in the spent medium were measured at 24 h. Glucose dose-dependently stimulated nitric oxide production (measured as the stable oxidation product, nitrite) (Fig. 1), reaching maximum levels at 10 mm glucose. Under conditions of very low glucose levels (0–1 mm), LPS-induced IL-1 activity was not detected over control levels. However, at glucose concentrations corresponding toin vivo basal blood glucose levels (2–6 mm), IL-1 activity release was 10-fold over nonstimulated control levels. A sharp decline in the release of IL-1 activity occurs with a further rise in glucose levels and IL-1 release is almost completely inhibited at 10–20 mm, which corresponds to hyperglycemic blood glucose levels. To determine whether this inhibition of IL-1 release required glucose transport and/or metabolism, 2-deoxyglucose was added to LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells for 24 h (Fig. 2). The compound, 2-deoxyglucose, competes with glucose for the GLUT-2 transporter, and phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose by hexokinase effectively inhibits glucose flux through the glycolytic pathway. At 5 mm glucose, LPS induced a 10-fold increase in the release of IL-1 activity, but IL-1 release was completely inhibited at 15 mm glucose. 2-Deoxyglucose (5 mm) blocked the inhibitory effect of 15 mm glucose. The ability of 2-deoxyglucose to block the inhibitory effects of glucose on IL-1 release suggests that metabolism is required for inhibition. To determine whether other metabolized sugars could inhibit IL-1 release, the effect of hexoses closely related to glucose were added to LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells in the presence of 5 mmd-glucose (Fig. 3). l-Glucose andd-galactose, hexoses that are not metabolized by these cells, had little effect on IL-1 release at concentrations up to 20 mm. d-Fructose, moderately metabolized by macrophages, dose-dependently inhibited IL-1 release, but higher concentrations were required for complete inhibition than ford-mannose, which is metabolized at a similar rate to glucose. To determine whether the inhibitory effect of high glucose on IL-1 release is reversible, RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS for 24 h in the presence of 0–20 mm glucose (Fig. 4). As shown previously in Fig. 1, IL-1 release was maximal at 2–6 mm glucose but was attenuated in the absence of glucose (0 mm) and at 8–20 mm glucose. Following the 24-h incubation, RAW cells were washed and incubated with fresh medium containing 5 mmglucose for an additional 24 h. IL-1 release from cells initially incubated in the absence of glucose (0 mm) was still attenuated as compared with 5 mm glucose. However, IL-1 release from cells previously incubated at high glucose levels (7–20 mm) returned to maximal levels observed at 5 mmglucose, suggesting that inhibition by high glucose is fully reversible after 24 h following removal of excess (7–20 mm) glucose. To determine when high glucose levels must be present to inhibit IL-1 release, RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) in the presence of 5 mm glucose for 24 h. Glucose was added at the indicated times during the incubation for a final concentration of 15 mm (Fig. 5). When added during the first 10 h of a 24-h incubation, 15 mmglucose almost completely inhibited IL-1 release. Addition of glucose after 10 h resulted in only partial (11–14 h) or no (15–24 h) inhibition, demonstrating that the inhibitory action of high glucose occurs within the first 10 h of the incubation. That high glucose levels exert inhibitory effects at an early time point suggests that high glucose may be inhibiting the induction or synthesis of IL-1. To determine whether high glucose attenuates the release of bioactive IL-1 by inhibiting LPS-induced synthesis of IL-1, both intracellular and extracellular IL-1 activity was measured (Fig. 6). Following a 24-h incubation in the presence of 0, 5, 10, or 20 mm glucose, extracellular IL-1 released by RAW cells into the medium was assayed for activity (Fig. 6 a). As demonstrated previously, 0, 10 and 20 mm glucose exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on the release of IL-1 activity. To measure intracellular activity, the cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, lysed by sonication, and assayed for IL-1 activity (Fig. 6 b). While intracellular IL-1 activity was attenuated in the absence of glucose (0 mm), glucose at 10 and 20 mm failed to inhibit IL-1 activity as compared with 5 mm glucose. These data suggest that high glucose has little effect on IL-1 synthesis but has a strong inhibitory effect on the release of IL-1. To confirm that high glucose levels inhibit IL-1 release but not synthesis, immunoprecipitation of intra- and extracellular IL-1α was performed (Fig. 7). LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 12 h in the presence of 2 or 20 mm glucose. The cells were then washed, fresh chase medium added, and the incubation continued for a total of 24 h. At 24 h, a large amount of extracellular IL-1α was detected at 2 mm glucose but not 20 mm glucose or in unstimulated samples (Fig. 7). IL-1α, mainly in the form of precursor protein, was detected intracellularly at 20 mm glucose with a lesser amount of protein at 2 mm glucose, suggesting that metabolically labeled intracellular IL-1α stores were depleted by release at 2 mm glucose in LPS-stimulated cells. These data combined with the findings in Fig. 6 b indicating that elevated glucose concentrations of 10 and 20 mm do not alter intracellular IL-1 activity, add further support to the conclusion that high glucose levels inhibit IL-1 release but not synthesis. In our previous studies (17Hill J.R. Corbett J.A. Kwon G. Marshall C.A. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22672-22679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) more than 90% of IL-1 activity released by activated RAW 264.7 cells at 24 h was due to IL-1α. Neither IL-1β or precursor IL-1β were detected above control levels in parallel pulse labeling studies to assess IL-1β processing and release (data not shown), probably due to the low level of IL-1β released by RAW 264.7 cells. Recently, several studies have implicated PKC activation by glucose in diabetic complications due to hyperglycemia (24Williams B. Schrier R.W. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Craven P.A. Davidson C.M. DeRubertis F.R. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 667-674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Inoguchi T. Battan R. Handler E.

Physiol. 1995; 269: H1297-H1302PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether PKC activation plays a role in high glucose inhibition of IL-1 release, we tested the effects of PKC inhibitors. LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with 5–20 mmglucose for 24 h, and IL-1 activity released into the medium was measured. Selective PKC inhibitors, chelerythrine (10 μm, IC50 = 0.6 μm for PKC (28Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar)) and calphostin C (1 μm, IC50 = 0.05 μm for PKC; incubation under lighted conditions (29Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar)), a nonselective inhibitor, H7 (100 μm, IC50 = 6 μm for PKC (30Schachtele C. Seifert R. Osswald H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)), and a selective PKA inhibitor, H89 (1 μm, IC50 = 0.048 μm for PKA (31Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) were added at 4 h post-LPS stimulation to minimize effects on LPS signaling. High glucose (10–20 mm) inhibited IL-1 release in controls lacking kinase inhibitors and with the PKA inhibitor, H89 (Fig. 8). However, the specific PKC inhibitors, chelerythrine and calphostin C, and the nonspecific PKC inhibitor, H7, blocked the inhibitory effects due to high glucose without affecting IL-1 release at 5 mm glucose. In related experiments, it was determined that the presence of PKC inhibitors was required during the initial 12 h of the incubation to block the inhibitory effects of high glucose (data not shown). To confirm that PKC activation can mediate the inhibition of IL-1 release, the effects of a PKC agonist, PMA, on IL-1 release were analyzed. RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with LPS (5 mm glucose), LPS (15 mm glucose), or LPS (5 mm glucose + PMA 100 nm) for 24 h (Fig. 9). PMA, like high glucose, almost completely inhibited the release of IL-1, and this inhibition was blocked by addition (at 4 h) of 10 μm chelerythrine. The activity of PKC was measured in RAW cells at 4 and 24 h post-LPS stimulation (Fig. 10). At 4 h, the presence of 20 mm glucose increases PKC activity over levels at 5 mm glucose (Fig. 10 a). As a positive control, PMA (100 nm) also increases measured activity. At 24 h (Fig. 10 b), the presence of high glucose actually decreases activity, suggesting a down-regulation of PKC activity following an initial increase. Diabetics have more frequent infections and of longer duration than non-diabetics (1Smitherman K.O. Peacock J.E. Med. Clin. N. Am. 1995; 79: 53-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 2Bessman A.N. Sapico F.L. J. Diabetes Complications. 1992; 6: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) due to a decrease in bactericidal activity linked to hyperglycemia (4Rayfield E.J. Ault M.J. Keusch G.T. Brothers M.J. Nechemias C. Smith H. Am. J. Med. 1982; 72: 439-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that high glucose inhibits the release of IL-1, a key mediator of the immune response and effective defense against microorganisms (32Dinarello C.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1314-1325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), from murine macrophages. IL-1 release from RAW 264.7 murine macrophages is maximal at 2–6 mm glucose (∼basal blood glucose levels), but is inhibited at higher concentrations (8–20 mm) corresponding to hyperglycemia in diabetes (Fig. 1). At very low glucose levels (0–1 mm), IL-1 release and production are inhibited (Figs. 1 and6), confirming a report by Orlinska and Newton (33Orlinska U. Newton R.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that a minimal level of glucose is required for IL-1 synthesis. In contrast to a decrease in IL-1 release, nitric oxide production by RAW 264.7 cells increases with higher glucose levels (Fig. 1). This increase in nitric oxide synthase activity was also observed by Sharmaet al. (34Sharma K. Danoff T.M. DePiero A. Ziyadeh F.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and was mediated by glucose activation of PKC. The inhibitory effect on IL-1 release by high glucose levels requires metabolism as 2-deoxyglucose, a glucose transport and metabolism inhibitor, blocks the glucose effect (Fig. 2). Related hexoses that are metabolized by macrophages, fructose and mannose, mimic the inhibitory effect of glucose, but nonmetabolized sugars, l-glucose and galactose, have no effect on IL-1 release (Fig. 3). The inhibition of IL-1 release by high glucose levels is fully reversible at 24 h by removal of excess glucose (Fig. 4), indicating that glucose effects are transient and are not toxic to the cells. This reversibility is consistent with the recovery of infection fighting ability in hyperglycemics upon normalization of blood glucose (5Jones C.A. Seifert M.F. Dixit P.K. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1982; 170: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). A time study revealed that high glucose (15 mm) is effective in inhibiting IL-1 release only during the first 10 h of a 24-h incubation (Fig. 5). Addition of elevated levels of glucose after 14 h had no effect. These early effects of glucose suggest a role in blocking LPS signaling and IL-1 induction and synthesis; however, measurement of intra- and extracellular IL-1 activity and protein suggest that IL-1 synthesis is not affected by high glucose (Figs. 6 and 7). Pulse labeling studies with LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells demonstrate the recovery of proteolytically processed IL-1α in the culture medium following a 12-h chase in the presence of 2 mm, but not 20 mm, glucose. The absence of any precursor or processed IL-1α in the culture medium in the presence of 20 mm glucose under these pulse-chase conditions combined with the inability of 10 or 20 mm glucose to alter intracellular IL-1 activity further supports this conclusion that only IL-1 release and not synthesis is inhibited by high glucose concentrations. Hyperglycemia is a major causal factor in the development of complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and vascular dysfunctions in diabetic patients, and these adverse effects have been attributed to activation of PKC via de novo synthesis of diacylglycerol (24Williams B. Schrier R.W. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Craven P.A. Davidson C.M. DeRubertis F.R. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 667-674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Inoguchi T.

Physiol. 1995; 269: H1297-H1302PubMed Google Scholar). In our study, inhibitors of PKC (but not PKA) blocked the inhibitory effects of high glucose levels on IL-1 release (Fig. 8). An activator of PKC, PMA, mimicked the inhibitory effects of glucose (Fig. 9) and PKC activity at 4 h post-LPS stimulation was increased by 20 mm glucose (Fig. 10). These results demonstrate that high glucose inhibits IL-1 release from RAW 264.7 cells by an early increase in PKC activity. While 20 mm glucose increases PKC activity at 4 h post-LPS stimulation, prolonged exposure (24 h) to high glucose concentration decreases PKC activity (Fig. 10). PKC activity does not appear to be required for IL-1 release as PKC inhibitors do not block IL-1 release (Fig. 8). Thus, this late decrease in PKC activity does not directly account for the inhibitory actions of glucose. High glucose levels inhibit the production of cGMP (35Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14636-14642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Craven P.A. Studer P.K. DeRubertis F.R. J. Clin.

McDaniel, unpublished results. probably through a PKC-mediated mechanism as inhibitors of PKC abrogate glucose-induced reductions of cGMP. We recently reported that IL-1 release by macrophages is mediated by nitric oxide via increases in cGMP levels (17Hill J.R. Corbett J.A. Kwon G. Marshall C.A. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22672-22679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). IL-1 release (but not production) was blocked by inhibitors of both nitric oxide synthase and guanylate cyclase and restored upon addition of exogenous nitric oxide and cGMP. Thus, high glucose levels may inhibit IL-1 release by lowering cGMP levels and interfering with the secretion pathway. Studies are currently underway to explore the role of cGMP in the glucose-induced inhibition of IL-1 release. Alternatively, PKC may interfere with the IL-1 secretion pathway by phosphorylation of protein(s)-mediating secretion. The mechanism of IL-1 release is unique and relatively unknown as IL-1 is expressed without a leader sequence and is not secreted via the classic endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi apparatus as is the case with other cytokines (16Miller D.K. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Molineaux S.M. Thornberry N.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 696: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Further research in this area may identify potential targets for PKC phosphorylation and disruption of IL-1 secretion. Although the overproduction of IL-1 contributes to a variety of inflammatory diseases, IL-1 is necessary for proper immune function. Blocking the IL-1 receptor with its receptor antagonist, IL-1Ra, or by antibody neutralization increases infection, suggesting that a sufficient level of endogenous IL-1 is required for normal host defense (32Dinarello C.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1314-1325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that increased susceptibility of uncontrolled diabetics to infection may result from impaired macrophage function (5Jones C.A. Seifert M.F. Dixit P.K. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1982; 170: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rayfield et al. (4Rayfield E.J. Ault M.J. Keusch G.T. Brothers M.J. Nechemias C. Smith H. Am. J. Med. 1982; 72: 439-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) have reported a significant correlation between the prevalence of infection and the mean plasma glucose levels in diabetic patients. These findings support the concept that control of blood glucose levels in diabetic patients is required to maintain normal host defense mechanisms that determine resistance to infection. Our in vitro findings indicate that media glucose concentrations comparable with uncontrolled diabetics, i.e. >8 mm, significantly attenuate IL-1 release from LPS-activated macrophages. Furthermore, inhibition of IL-1 release by elevated glucose concentrations (>8 mm) is readily reversed following the normalization of glucose to basal levels of 5 mm. Although a variety of factors are present during episodes of hyperglycemia in diabetics that may contribute to increased susceptibility to infection, e.g. ketoacidosis, vascular complications, metabolic and lipid derangements, it is tempting to propose based on these in vitro studies that impaired IL-1 release by monocytes and macrophages may be an important causative factor. In conclusion, we report that high glucose levels (8–20 mm) inhibit IL-1 release (but not production) by RAW 264.7 murine macrophages, and these glucose effects are mediated by PKC activation. These studies may shed light on the reasons for the prevalence of infections in poorly controlled diabetics and suggest possible interventions for treatment of these infections.

The ability of thyroid hormone receptors to repress transcription in the absence of ligand is thought to be due to associations with nuclear hormone receptor corepressors. Ligand binding by the thyroid hormone receptor is believed to dissociate these corepressors and recruit coactivators to promote transcription from target promoters. We hypothesize that variations in response element architecture may influence both the association and dissociation of corepressors from DNA-bound thyroid hormone receptors. Using a chimeric corepressor, we find that ligand alone does not fully relieve corepressor-mediated repression, particularly in the presence of thyroid hormone receptor and its heterodimerization partner, the retinoid X receptor. Interestingly, the steroid receptor coactivator 1 together with ligand is able to mediate full release of corepression, but this relief is dependent upon the architecture of the response element to which the nuclear receptor dimer-corepressor complex is bound. These studies suggest that other cellular factors in addition to ligand may be required for the release of corepressors from thyroid hormone receptor dimers.

Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) 1The abbreviations used are: TR, thyroid hormone receptor; TRE, thyroid hormone response element; RXR, retinoid X receptor; T3, thyroid hormone (3,5,3′-triiodothyronine); triac, 3,5,3′-triiodothyroacetic acid; N-CoR, nuclear receptor corepressor; T-CoR, Tup1 N-CoR chimeric protein; SMRT, silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors; SRC-1, steroid receptor coactivator 1; DR, direct repeat; Pal, palindrome; IP, inverted palindrome. 1The abbreviations used are: TR, thyroid hormone receptor; TRE, thyroid hormone response element; RXR, retinoid X receptor; T3, thyroid hormone (3,5,3′-triiodothyronine); triac, 3,5,3′-triiodothyroacetic acid; N-CoR, nuclear receptor corepressor; T-CoR, Tup1 N-CoR chimeric protein; SMRT, silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors; SRC-1, steroid receptor coactivator 1; DR, direct repeat; Pal, palindrome; IP, inverted palindrome. are ligand-modulated transcription factors in the erbA superfamily that are found constitutively in the nucleus, bound to specific DNA sequences known as thyroid hormone response elements (TREs). TRs can bind TREs as monomers, homodimers, or heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and positively or negatively regulate gene expression depending on the nature of the TRE and the presence of thyroid hormone (T3). TREs are generally composed of two or more TR binding half-sites arranged as direct repeats spaced by four nucleotides, palindromes without a nucleotide spacer, or inverted palindromes spaced by six nucleotides (1Williams G.R. Brent G.A. Weintraub B.D. Molecular Endocrinology: Basic Concepts and Clinical Correlations. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1995: 217-239Google Scholar). The optimal TR binding half-site is the octamer TAAGGTCA, an extended version of the common core response element hexamer AGGTCA (2Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19392-19397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a system devoid of endogenous RXR, we have shown that TREs composed of optimal octameric half-sites can be activated by TR alone. In contrast, TREs composed of sub-optimal hexameric half-sites require the expression of RXR with TR for substantial gene activation (3Olson D.P. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9907-9914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, unliganded TRs can function as transcriptional repressors when bound to positive TREs (4Brent G.A. Dunn M.K. Harney J.W. Gulick T. Larsen P.R. Moore D.D. New Biol. 1989; 1: 329-336PubMed Google Scholar). Upon T3 binding, however, TRs direct the activation of gene expression from target promoters. Recent studies have characterized numerous TR-associated proteins that play important roles in converting unliganded TR transcriptional repression into liganded TR activation. In the absence of bound ligand, TRs associate with the nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) or the silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT), which mediates the repression of basal levels of gene expression from target promoters (5Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Söderström M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar, 6Chen J.D.

TR binding of T3 is thought to induce a conformational change in the receptor, which results in dissociation of the corepressor complex and allows recruitment of coactivators such as the steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) (7Oñate S.A.

The association of coactivators with the liganded TR tethers activation domains into the vicinity of target promoters, resulting in transcriptional activation. Gene activation in response to thyroid hormone is, therefore, both a release of repression and a recruitment of activation functions. The molecular mechanisms by which ligand binding modulates these opposed functions are only beginning to be understood. All mammalian cell lines examined to date contain endogenous corepressors and coactivators, which complicates studies designed to address the roles of these cofactors in TR-dependent gene regulation. To delineate the relative contributions of release of repression and recruitment of coactivation functions in T3-dependent gene activation, we have reconstituted TR-dependent gene expression in the lower eukaryoteS. cerevisiae. Since S. cerevisiae lacks endogenous nuclear hormone receptors, nuclear receptor corepressors, and nuclear receptor coactivators, it provides a null background in which the functions of these molecules can be studied independently or in combination. It has been shown that unliganded TRβ is a transcriptional activator in S. cerevisiae (3Olson D.P. Koenig R.J. J. Biol.

Ligand-dependent gene activation (above this basal activation) from single copy TREs requires the presence of coactivators such as SRC-1 (3Olson D.P. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9907-9914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the orientation of the half-sites composing single TREs and the 5′ dinucleotides flanking the hexameric half-sites modulate the ability of SRC-1 to induce gene expression in response to ligand (3Olson D.P. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9907-9914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Given this influence of TRE architecture on coactivation, we hypothesized that similar TRE variations also may modulate the ability of corepressors to repress transcription from target promoters. To test this hypothesis we have examined the influence of a nuclear receptor corepressor on TR function in a panel of yeast reporter strains bearing different TREs. All yeast strains were derived from the parental strain SEY 6210 (MATα; ura3–52; leu2–3, -112; his3-Δ200; trp1-Δ901; lys2–801; suc2-Δ9). β-Galactosidase reporter constructs containing octameric (optimal) or hexameric (suboptimal) direct repeats or palindromes (Table I) were inserted into the yeast chromosome at the leu2 locus by homologous recombination (3Olson D.P.

The 5′ oligonucleotide primer encoded a 5′ EcoRI restriction site, start codon, and 18 nucleotides of the SV40 nuclear localization sequence; the 3′ oligonucleotide primer contained anApaI site and the reverse complement of Tup1 codons 195–200. The amplified fragment was digested with EcoRI and ApaI, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and then ligated to the gel-purified ApaI-ClaI fragment of pBKS-N-CoR (5Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M.

This ∼2.6 kilobase pair fragment, designated T-CoR, was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and then ligated into the multiple cloning site of the expression vector p424-GPD using the EcoRI and ClaI sites. Yeast strains were grown in selective synthetic media containing a nonrepressive carbon source (3% glycerol, 3% ethanol) to limit the levels of nuclear receptor expression before hormone inductions. Yeast cultures were diluted to an absorbance at 650 nm (A 650) of 0.2, nuclear receptor expression was induced by the addition of 3% galactose, and the cultures were grown overnight at 30 °C in the presence or absence of 1 μm3,5,3′-triiodothyroacetic acid (triac), a T3 analog. The next day theA 650 of each culture was determined. 1.5 ml of each culture was pelleted by microcentrifugation, the supernatants were removed, and the pellets were frozen at −20 °C. The β-galactosidase activity of each pellet was measured as described previously (3Olson D.P. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9907-9914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activities were normalized to the level of activity present in each yeast reporter strain containing an empty nuclear receptor expression vector and the indicated p413-TEF and p424-GPD constructs. Data represent the results of at least five independent experiments and are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Percent repression was calculated as the difference between the normalized β-galactosidase activities in the presence of nuclear receptors alone and the activity in the presence of nuclear receptors plus T-CoR divided by the difference between the normalized β-galactosidase activity of the nuclear receptors alone and the normalized activity in the absence of nuclear receptor expression. Thus, if T-CoR totally abolished TR-mediated gene activation, repression would equal 100%. Statistical analysis of data was by Student's t test. Transformation of yeast with N-CoR or SMRT expression vectors failed to repress reporter gene activation by TR or RXR + TR (data not shown). Although N-CoR expression was detected by immunoprecipitation (data not shown), it is difficult to know whether the lack of functional repression was due to an insufficient level of N-CoR expression or incompatibilities with potential downstream targets in yeast (or lack of such targets in yeast). To overcome this problem, the chimeric protein T-CoR was constructed and studied as a corepressor of TR-mediated gene activation in yeast. In the absence of ligand, TR-TR homodimers and RXR-TR heterodimers function as constitutive activators in yeast, presumably due to the lack of nuclear corepressors (3Olson D.P. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9907-9914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Hall B.L. Smit-McBride Z. Privalsky M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A yeast strain bearing an optimal direct repeat TRE (8DR4) β-galactosidase reporter construct was activated 8.0-fold by the expression of TR alone in the absence of triac (Fig. 1 A). T-CoR repressed this activity to just a 2.7-fold stimulation, which represents a 76% repression. This repression was dependent on the presence of TRβ1, as T-CoR expression had essentially no effect on the levels of reporter gene activity in reporter strains bearing an empty nuclear receptor expression plasmid (data not shown) or in the context of RXR alone (Fig. 1 B). In addition, native Tup1 did not repress TRβ-induced β-galactosidase activity (data not shown). In the presence of the corepressor, ligand relieved the T-CoR-mediated repression of TR-TR homodimer activity, as the induction of reporter gene activity rose from 2.7-fold without triac to 4.7-fold with triac (p = 0.004). This 4.7-fold induction in the presence of ligand was marginally less than that achieved when T-CoR was absent (6.1-fold; p = 0.09), suggesting that ligand binding by TR may not quite be capable of fully relieving T-CoR-mediated repression of the TR-TR homodimer. The data were qualitatively similar when 8DR4 was activated by coexpressed TR and RXR (Fig. 1 C). Overall, the data demonstrate that, in the absence of ligand, T-CoR functions as a corepressor of TR-mediated gene expression from an optimal direct repeat TRE in the context of TR alone or TR with RXR, and that ligand largely relieves this repression. In addition, T-CoR functioned more effectively as a corepressor of constitutive TR-TR homodimer activity than of RXR + TR activity (76% repression versus 55%;p = 0.003), suggesting the possibility of different functional interactions of corepressor with TR-TR homodimersversus RXR-TR heterodimers. T-CoR function also was studied in the context of the sub-optimal direct repeat 6DR4, which requires the coexpression of RXR with TR for substantial gene activation (3Olson D.P. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9907-9914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, although expression of TR or RXR alone had little or no effect on reporter gene activity (Fig. 2, A and B), coexpression of TR and RXR led to a 5.7-fold induction of β-galactosidase in the absence of triac (Fig. 2 C). This 5.7-fold RXR + TR induction was repressed to 2.3-fold (73% repression) upon expression of T-CoR. The addition of triac, however, was unable to relieve this repression, as reporter gene induction remained essentially unchanged at 2.4-fold (Fig. 2 C). Thus T-CoR repressed gene activation mediated by an obligate RXR-TR heterodimer from the sub-optimal TRE 6DR4. However, in contrast to the situation with TR-TR homodimers on 8DR4, this T-CoR-mediated repression of RXR-TR heterodimers on 6DR4 was unaltered by the addition of ligand. This suggests that other factors in addition to ligand may be required to relieve corepressor-mediated repression, particularly in the context of the RXR-TR heterodimer. To assess the importance of half-site orientation on corepressor function, we expressed various combinations of T-CoR, TR, and RXR in a yeast strain containing a reporter construct driven by an optimal palindromic TRE (8Pal0) or an optimal inverted palindromic TRE (8IP6). T-CoR had no effect on reporter gene activity from 8IP6 in the presence of TR alone, RXR alone, or TR with RXR (data not shown). However, on the palindrome 8Pal0, T-CoR mediated a 73% repression of TR-TR homodimer activity and a 74% repression of RXR + TR activity in the absence of triac (Fig. 3, A and C). Thus, in contrast to the results with the optimal direct repeat 8DR4, T-CoR was equally effective in mediating repression in the presence of TR alone and TR with RXR. The addition of triac modestly relieved T-CoR-mediated repression from 8Pal0 in the context of TR alone (from 73 to 49% repression;p = 0.01), but did not significantly do so in the presence of TR with RXR (p = 0.2). Taken together, these data would suggest that corepressor-mediated repression may be influenced by TRE half-site orientation, and the release of corepressors from TR may require other events in addition to ligand binding, particularly in the context of RXR-TR heterodimers. Baniahmad et al.(17Baniahmad A. Leng X. Burris T.P. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 76-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that disruption of the AF-2 activation domain in the extreme C terminus of TRβ1 did not destroy the ability of the receptor to bind ligand but did abolish the ability of ligand to relieve the silencing function of TRβ1. These authors suggested the potential importance of ligand-dependent trans-activating factors, which interact with the AF-2 domain, in the release of receptor-associated corepressors. In yeast, since no endogenous nuclear receptor coactivators exist to associate with the liganded nuclear receptor complex, it might be predicted that ligand alone would fail to relieve corepressor activity fully. We hypothesized that the presence of a nuclear receptor coactivator in addition to T-CoR might be sufficient to restore complete ligand-dependent relief of T-CoR-mediated corepression in the yeast reporter strains. To test this hypothesis, we coexpressed the mammalian coactivator SRC-1 with T-CoR and examined its ability to augment the release of T-CoR-mediated corepression in response to the addition of ligand. If SRC-1 functions to enhance the release of T-CoR-mediated repression, we would predict that the induction of reporter gene activity in strains expressing both T-CoR and SRC-1 would approximate the levels seen in strains expressing SRC-1 alone. Reporter gene inductions lower than this level would suggest an incomplete release of T-CoR-mediated repression. Since triac was particularly ineffective at relieving T-CoR-mediated repression of RXR-TR heterodimers on 6DR4 (Fig. 2 C), we first examined the effect of SRC-1 in this context. The 4.2-fold induction of reporter gene expression seen in the presence of TR, RXR, and triac dropped to 2.4-fold when T-CoR was added (Fig. 2 C). Contrary to our hypothesis, coexpression of SRC-1 was not effective at relieving this repression; β-galactosidase induction remained unchanged at 2.6-fold, whereas full release of the T-CoR effect should have led to a 5.3-fold induction (i.e. the fold induction seen in the presence of TR, RXR, triac, and SRC-1 without T-CoR) (Fig. 4 C). Similarly, studies with T-CoR-mediated repression of RXR-TR heterodimers on 8DR4 demonstrated that SRC-1 fails to enhance the relief of repression by triac (data not shown). In contrast to the results seen with the DRs, on 8Pal0, SRC-1 is able to substantially enhance the triac-mediated release of T-CoR repression. In the case of the expression of RXR plus TR without SRC-1, T-CoR repressed β-galactosidase induction from 4.8-fold to 1.9-fold, and triac did not significantly relieve this repression (Fig. 3 C). In the presence of SRC-1, T-CoR was still a strong repressor of RXR+TR activity, as expected, reducing reporter gene induction in the absence of triac from 4.7- to 2.2-fold (Fig. 5 C; Figs. 5, A and B, will be discussed subsequently). Now, however, the addition of triac allowed the 2.2-fold induction to rise to 5.9-fold, which approaches the level seen with TR, RXR, SRC-1, and triac in the absence of T-CoR (7.9-fold). Thus, triac plus SRC-1 was more effective than triac alone at relieving T-CoR-mediated repression of RXR + TR activity on 8Pal0 (p = 0.017). The situation with TR homodimers on 8Pal0 was similar to that with RXR plus TR. Thus, in the absence of SRC-1, TR homodimer induction was repressed from 3.4- to 1.6-fold by T-CoR expression (73% repression), and the addition of triac had only a modest effect on this (49% residual repression) (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, repression was essentially fully relieved by the coexpression of SRC-1; reporter gene induction was 10.2-fold in the presence of TR, SRC-1, and triac and 9.8-fold in the presence of TR, SRC-1, T-CoR, and triac (7% residual repression) (Fig. 5 A). As expected, reporter gene activity was essentially unaffected by the expression of SRC-1, RXR, and T-CoR in the absence of TR (Fig. 5 B). In summary, T-CoR-mediated repression of RXR-TR was refractory to both ligand and coactivator in the context of the suboptimal and optimal DRs. However, when the TRE was composed of palindromic half-sites, ligand and co-activator cooperated to release T-CoR-mediated repression of RXR-TR heterodimers. For TR homodimers, ligand alone nearly completely relieved T-CoR-mediated repression, and this effect was enhanced by coactivator, especially on the palindromic TRE. We conclude that response element half-site sequence and orientation may influence the ability of ligand and coactivator to relieve T-CoR-mediated repression. Thyroid hormone receptors are found constitutively bound to DNA at response element sequences. In general, unliganded TRs function as transcriptional repressors of nearby target promoters. Thyroid hormone binding serves to convert the TR from a repressor to an activator of transcription. The interaction of unliganded TRs with corepressor proteins seems a likely explanation for the repression exhibited by unliganded TRs bound to positive TREs. Thyroid hormone binding by TR is thought to induce a conformational change in the receptor, which in some way promotes corepressor dissociation. This ligand-induced destabilization of the TR-corepressor interaction has been demonstrated in vitro(5Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y.

However, the identification of TR mutants that retain the ability to bind ligand but fail to release silencing functions and fail to activate gene expression suggested that ligand alone may not be sufficient to release corepressor activities from TR (17Baniahmad A. Leng X. Burris T.P. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 76-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known regarding the functional importance of TRE architecture in regulating unliganded TR-mediated repression. Given the influence of TRE architecture on the function of coactivators (3Olson D.P. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9907-9914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Walfish P.G. Yoganathan T. Yang Y.F. Hong H. Butt T.R. Stallcup M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3697-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that variations in the sequence and orientation of TRE half-sites also would modulate corepressor function. S. cerevisiae provided an excellent null background in which to examine the regulation of corepressor release from TR-TR homodimers and RXR-TR heterodimers, since, in contrast to mammalian cells, endogenous nuclear receptors, nuclear receptor corepressors, and nuclear receptor coactivators are absent in this organism. Our initial efforts were directed at studying wild type SMRT or N-CoR in yeast. However, neither SMRT nor N-CoR functioned as a corepressor in our system. Whether this was due to poor expression of these molecules or incompatible differences between mammalian repression domains and yeast basal machinery targets is not clear. To circumvent this problem, we have constructed a fusion protein referred to as T-CoR in which the repression domain of the yeast repressor Tup1 is fused in-frame to the nuclear receptor interaction domains of N-CoR. In yeast, T-CoR functioned as a corepressor of constitutive TR-TR and RXR-TR activity, and this repression could be modulated to varying degrees by the addition of ligand. How relevant is T-CoR to the study of mammalian corepressor function? Recent studies have shown that repression by N-CoR and SMRT involves an interaction with Sin3A and a histone deacetylase (20Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M. Brard G. Ngo S.D. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 21Nagy L. Kao H.Y.

Repression by Tup1 does not appear to utilize the yeast homologs of Sin3A and histone deacetylase (22Kadosh D. Struhl K. Cell. 1997; 89: 365-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Therefore, T-CoR is not likely to repress transcription by the identical molecular mechanisms used by N-CoR and SMRT in mammalian cells. However, evidence suggests that interactions with Sin3A and histone deacetylase do not fully account for N-CoR- and SMRT-mediated repression (23Wolffe A.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 16-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Therefore, it remains possible that the mechanism of repression by these proteins is at least partially related to the mechanism of repression by Tup1. More importantly, the mode of repression by N-CoR is unlikely to alter the mechanisms by which it is recruited and released from TR, as that information appears to be encoded in distinct interaction domains contained within its C terminus (24Seol W. Mahon M.J. Lee Y.K. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1646-1655PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zamir I. Harding H.P. Atkins G.B. Hörlein A. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5458-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Since N-CoR and SMRT do not function in our yeast system, T-CoR is a reasonable tool for dissecting the recruitment and release of corepressors from nuclear receptors bound to the response elements of target genes. We found that the ability of T-CoR to repress TR-mediated gene activation depended upon the composition of the nuclear receptor dimer (TR-TR or RXR-TR) and the sequence and orientation of the half-sites to which the nuclear receptor dimer was bound. Although T-CoR repressed unliganded TR-TR homodimers on optimal direct repeat and optimal palindromic elements equally well, the ability of ligand alone to relieve this repression was substantially better from the optimal direct repeat than from the optimal palindromic TRE. The functional interaction of mammalian corepressors with nuclear hormone receptors has been shown to require the involvement of two nuclear receptor ligand binding domains (26Zamir I. Zhang J.S. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Conformational differences imposed upon a TR-TR homodimer by binding a direct repeat TRE versus a palindromic TRE may alter the positioning of the ligand binding domains in such a way as to account for the unequivalent release of T-CoR-mediated repression upon addition of ligand. Importantly, however, on 8Pal0, SRC-1 enhanced the ability of triac to release corepressor activity, achieving an effect similar to that of triac alone on 8DR4. On the other hand, unliganded RXR-TR heterodimers were repressed by T-CoR, but ligand alone failed to substantially relieve T-CoR-mediated repression of heterodimers bound to sub-optimal direct repeat and optimal palindromic TREs. Moreover, SRC-1 did not augment the ligand-dependent relief of T-CoR-mediated repression from RXR-TR heterodimers bound to direct repeat TREs. This contrasts with the potent ability of SRC-1 to augment the relief of T-CoR-mediated corepression on 8Pal0. This would suggest that the conformational differences in the TR-dimer dictated by its binding to different TREs influences the ability of SRC-1 to augment the release of the corepressor in response to ligand. Additionally, this suggests that other mammalian nuclear factors, perhaps other coactivators, are required for the release of corepressors from RXR-TR heterodimers bound to direct repeat TREs. It is possible that differences in corepressor release from TR homodimers and RXR-TR heterodimers may have important biological functions. Sequestration of the promiscuous heterodimerization partner RXR either by RXR-RXR homodimer activation in response to 9-cis-retinoic acid or through heterodimerization with other nuclear receptor family members may increase the relative importance of TR-TR homodimers in mediating T3 responses from high affinity TREs. This interplay might be particularly important during development, given the essential roles of both thyroid hormone and retinoic acid in this process. In addition, N-CoR interactions with TR have been suggested to play an important role in mediating ligand-independent activation from negative regulatory elements in the TRH promoter (27Tagami T. Madison L.D. Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2642-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulating the release of N-CoR from TR may be particularly relevant in overall T3 homeostasis. Our data demonstrate that the requirements for the release of corepressors from TR-TR homodimers and RXR-TR heterodimers are different and may be modulated by the architecture of the TRE to which the TR dimer is bound. We propose that the variations in half-site sequence, number, and orientation within naturally occurring TREs serve to modulate the composition of the bound nuclear receptor dimers, the recruitment and release of associated corepressor proteins, and the recruitment and function of coactivator proteins. These multiple layers of integrated regulation may be important in determining the complexity of responses to a seemingly simple thyroid hormone signal. We would like to thank Keith Koch, Dennis Thiele, and Diane Robins for helpful discussions and careful reading of this manuscript."

Intracellular proteolysis of viable streptococci for presentation of 17–31, bound by serine proteinase cleavage sites, was mediated by serine proteinases, whereas processing of soluble recombinant M5 protein required in addition cysteine proteinases. Furthermore, processing of 17–31 was resistant to ammonium chloride and thus was not dependent on endosome acidification. Cysteine and serine proteinase cleavage sites were located adjacent to 308–319, and its processing was dependent on serine, cysteine, and aspartic proteinases, as well as on endosomal acidification. The data suggest that antigen processing of two major T-cell epitopes on streptococcal M5 protein occurred in different endosomal compartments by different classes of intracellular proteinases. We studied endosomal proteolysis of the surface fibrillar M5 protein from viable Streptococcus pyogenes as an essential step involved in major histocompatibility complex class II-restricted antigen processing of two immunodominant CD4+T-cell epitopes (17–31/Ed and 308–319/Ad). Intracellular proteolysis of viable streptococci for presentation of 17–31, bound by serine proteinase cleavage sites, was mediated by serine proteinases, whereas processing of soluble recombinant M5 protein required in addition cysteine proteinases. Furthermore, processing of 17–31 was resistant to ammonium chloride and thus was not dependent on endosome acidification. Cysteine and serine proteinase cleavage sites were located adjacent to 308–319, and its processing was dependent on serine, cysteine, and aspartic proteinases, as well as on endosomal acidification. The data suggest that antigen processing of two major T-cell epitopes on streptococcal M5 protein occurred in different endosomal compartments by different classes of intracellular proteinases. Exogenous antigens have to be subjected to intracellular enzymatic processing by professional antigen-presenting cells for major histocompatibility class II (MHC-II) 1The abbreviations used are: MHC-II, major histocompatibility class II molecules; Ii, invariant; rM5, recombinant M5 protein; TLCK, Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; TPCK, N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone. 1The abbreviations used are: MHC-II, major histocompatibility class II molecules; Ii, invariant; rM5, recombinant M5 protein; TLCK, Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; TPCK, N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone.-dependent presentation of peptide fragments to CD4+ T-cells (1Harding C.V. MHC Molecules and Antigen Processing. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1997Google Scholar). Peptides released in late endosomes are transported to specialized MHC-II binding compartments for recognition by MHC-II molecules (2Mellman I. Pierre P. Amigorena S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 564-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 3Peters J.P. Neefjes J.J. Oorschot V. Ploegh H.L. Geuze H.J. Nature. 1991; 349: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). A chaperone molecule (the invariant (Ii) chain) associated with MHC-II molecules targets the nonameric αβ-Ii complex via endoplasmic reticulum and trans-Golgi network to endosomes. Ii chain is then sequentially cleaved by aspartic and cysteine proteinases, and HLA-DM (H2-M in mouse) facilitates the exchange of the class II-associated invariant chain peptide for processed antigenic peptides (4Busch R. Mellins E.D. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that antigen processing of certain proteins (influenza hemagglutinin and myelin basic protein) can also occur in early endosomal compartments with peptides being loaded on MHC-II molecules recycled from the plasma membrane (5Pinet V. Malnati M. Long E.O. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4852-4860PubMed Google Scholar, 6Pinet V. Vergelli M. Martin R. Bakke O. Long E.O. Nature. 1995; 375: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) to specialized class II vesicles. Intracellular proteolytic enzymes have been shown to be intrinsically associated with antigen processing (7Berg T. Gjøen T. Bakke O. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Indeed, at least two out of four classes of intracellular endopeptidases, namely aspartic and cysteine proteinases, have been shown to be directly involved in endosomal proteolysis of model antigens as well as in enzymatic processing of Ii chain (2Mellman I. Pierre P. Amigorena S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 564-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 7Berg T. Gjøen T. Bakke O. Biochem.

Immunol. 1990; 145: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, cathepsin S has been reported to be primarily engaged in degradation of Ii chain, thus facilitating the downstream peptide loading on MHC-II molecules (10Riese R.J. Wolf P.R. Brömme D. Natkin L.R. Villadangos J.A. Ploegh H.L. Chapman H.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). However, other classes of intracellular enzymes, i.e. metalloproteinases, may contribute to the overall efficiency of antigen processing (11Puri J. Factorovich Y. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3313-3317PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the proteolytic activity of endosomal enzymes is regulated by the pH gradient within the endosomal pathway (7Berg T. Gjøen T. Bakke O. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev.

Biochem. 1987; 56: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), suggesting that different classes of proteinases may be implicated in distinct MHC-II antigen processing compartments. We have previously shown that two CD4+-dependent T-cell epitopes (17–31/Ed and 308–319/Ad) located on the surface fibrillar M5 protein, the main virulence factor and protective antigen of Streptococcus pyogenes, were efficiently processed from viable streptococci for MHC-II-restricted presentation to specific CD4+ T-cell clones and T-cell hybridomas (14Robinson J.H.

In this report we present evidence that processing of 17–31 was mediated by serine proteinases, whereas 308–319 required serine, cysteine, and aspartic proteinases, suggesting that two epitopes on the same protein engage largely different endosomal compartments for MHC-II-dependent antigen processing. The murine macrophage cell line J774A.1 (H-2d, ATCC TIB 67) was used as antigen-presenting cells. T-cell hybridomas (HX17 and HY2) obtained by polyethylene glycol fusion of two M5 protein-specific T-cell clones (X17 and Y2) with BW5147 (TCRα−β−) cells (kindly provided by Dr. P. Marrack, Denver) were specific for epitopes 17–31/Edand 308–319/Ad of group A streptococcal type 5 M protein, respectively, as reported previously (17Delvig A.A. Kehoe M.A. Robinson J.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 205SCrossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Antigen-presenting cells and T-cell hybridomas were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 3.0 mml-glutamine, 0.05 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v). S. pyogenes (strain Manfredo) was grown overnight in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and the concentration was adjusted spectrophotometrically to 3 × 108 colony-forming units/ml (A 600 = 0.6).

Synthetic peptides covering two T-cell epitopes on the M5 protein ofS. pyogenes were purchased from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, Facility for Molecular Biology: (i) 15–33 peptide contained epitope 17–31/Ed, and (ii) 300–319 peptide covered epitope 308–319/Ad (14Robinson J.H. Atherton M.C. Goodacre J.A. Pinkney M. Weightman H. Kehoe M.A. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4324-4331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following adherence (6 × 104/well) (48-well plates, Bibby Sterilin Ltd., Staffordshire, UK) for 1 h, J774A.1 macrophages were treated with inhibitors for 30 min, unless stated otherwise. Viable streptococci (3 × 106/well), rM5 (1.0 μg/ml), or synthetic peptides (4.0 μg/ml) were added, and plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator for 1 h, after which nonphagocytosed bacteria were killed with gentamycin (50 μg/ml), and the plates were incubated for an additional 3 h. The macrophages were then fixed with 1.0% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and T-cell hybridoma cells were added (3 × 104/well) for 24 h. The culture supernatants were removed and stored at −20 °C for subsequent interleukin-2 assay. To ensure that the inhibition observed resulted from the specific, rather than nonspecific, effect of inhibitors, the viability of J774A.1 cells before fixation was confirmed in all experiments. All experiments were performed at least three times, and the data for a representative experiment are shown. The response of T-cell hybridomas was measured as proliferation of CTLL-2 cells (104/well) in the presence of T-cell hybridoma culture supernatants in flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates (Becton Dickinson Labware, New Jersey). Each supernatant was tested at a 1:2 dilution in duplicate for 24 h at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator, followed by pulse-labeling with 0.4 μCi of [3H]thymidine (TRA310, specific activity 2.0 Ci/mmol; Amersham International plc, Buckinghamshire, UK) for 18 h. Cells were harvested on glass fiber membranes, and radioactivity was quantitated using a direct beta counter (Matrix 9600, Packard Instrument Company, Meridan, CT). For antigen processing to take place, both the enzyme and the appropriate pH should be present within one endosomal compartment of the antigen-presenting cells to ensure efficient proteolysis. It has been shown that although intracellular proteinases are present in all endocytic compartments, to attain full enzymatic activity inactive proenzymes require exoproteolytic maturation controlled by the pH gradient within the endosomal pathway (7Berg T. Gjøen T. Bakke O. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 19Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Hence, endosomal acidification plays a pivotal role in antigen processing and presentation. To study the importance of endosomal acidification for processing of the streptococcal M5 protein for presentation of two immunodominant T-cell epitopes (17–31/Ed and 308–319/Ad) to specific T-cell hybridomas, we used two specific metabolic inhibitors. Monensin is a carboxylic (cationic) ionophore (20Finlay B.B. Falkow S. Biochimie (Paris). 1988; 70: 1089-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) that intercalates into membranes and mediates exchange of protons for potassium ions, thus effectively raising endosomal pH (12Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ammonium chloride is a weak base that promotes alkalinization of the endosome content (12Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ammonium chloride had no apparent effect on presentation of 17–31 (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, this inhibitor blocked processing of 308–319 from viable bacteria or rM5 protein, and reduced presentation of the relevant synthetic peptide. Monensin exhibited a profound inhibitory effect on presentation of 308–319 from both viable streptococci and soluble rM5, whereas only partial reduction of 17–31 presentation was recorded in the same experiments (Fig. 1 B). This data suggested that endosome acidification is critical for processing of 308–319, whereas processing of 17–31 was less dependent on endosomal pH. There is evidence to suggest that cysteine proteinases mediate antigen processing of some model antigens, such as sperm whale myoglobin (8Takahashi H. Cease K.B. Berzofsky J.A. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 2221-2229PubMed Google Scholar,21Streicher H.Z. Berkower I.J. Busch M. Gurd R.N. Berzofsky J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunology. 1995; 84: 164-170PubMed Google Scholar), synthetic oligopeptides (24Buus S. Werdelin O. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 452-458PubMed Google Scholar), and hen egg lysosyme (11Puri J. Factorovich Y. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3313-3317PubMed Google Scholar) but not ovalbumin (9Diment S. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar,25Bennett K. Levine T. Ellis J.S. Peanasky R.J. Samloff I.M. Kay J. Chain B.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To study the role of this class of proteinases in antigen processing, we used (2S,3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-3-methyl-butane, a membrane permeable inhibitor that reacts with a cysteine residue at the enzyme active center selectively inactivating cysteine proteinases (cathepsins L, S, and B) (13Bond J.S. Butler P.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 26Tamai M. Matsumoto K. Omura S. Koyama I. Ozawa Y. Hanada K. J. Pharmacobio-Dyn. 1986; 9: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This inhibitor blocked processing of 308–319 from viable streptococci and rM5 and processing of 17–31 from soluble rM5 but not from bacteria (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid, an irreversible cysteine proteinase inhibitor, blocked processing of 308–319 and caused only a marginal inhibition in presentation of 17–31 from rM5 (Fig. 2 B). Thus, processing of viable streptococci for 17–31 presentation was not dependent on cysteine proteinase activity, whereas this class of intracellular enzymes was critical for processing of 308–319 from bacteria and rM5. Data in Fig. 3 show the effect of other inhibitors on antigen processing. Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) and N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) were used to inactivate trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases, respectively (8Takahashi H. Cease K.B. Berzofsky J.A. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 2221-2229PubMed Google Scholar), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to block most serine proteinases. A peptide aldehyde leupeptin, which is known to react with serine/cysteine residues at enzyme active centers forming hemiacetal or hemithioacetal groups, was employed to inactivate both serine and cysteine proteinases (13Bond J.S. Butler P.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, A-D). We observed that TLCK and TPCK exerted a consistent blocking effect on processing of both epitopes (Fig. 3, A and C). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride inhibited 308–319 and marginally suppressed 17–31 presentation (Fig. 3 B). The effect of leupeptin on antigen processing was largely similar to that of (2S,3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-3-methyl-butane in that leupeptin blocked processing of 17–31 from soluble rM5 and 308–319 from both viable bacteria and rM5 (Fig. 3 D). Further data show that 1,10-phenanthroline, which blocks metalloproteinases, did not interfere with antigen processing of both epitopes (Fig. 4 B). No cleavage sites recognized by aspartic proteinases were present near both epitopes (Fig. 5). However, pepstatin, an acylated pentapeptide isolated from actinomycetes which is commonly used to irreversibly block aspartic proteinases, inhibited presentation of 308–319 but not 17–31 (Fig. 4 A).Figure 4Effect of inhibitors of other intracellular proteinases on presentation of two M5 protein T-cell epitopes.Presentation of two M5 protein-specific T-cell epitopes (17–31 and 308–319) from viable streptococci (squares), rM5 (diamonds), or synthetic peptides (circles) to specific T-cell hybridomas, HX17 (closed symbols) and HY2 (open symbols).

Evidence was obtained that engagement of a particular class of proteolytic enzymes in antigen processing of two epitopes on the streptococcal M5 protein was dependent on both the amino acids flanking the epitope and the form of antigen delivery (viable bacteria or soluble rM5). Indeed, our data suggested that processing of 17–31 from bacteria was mediated by serine proteinases and was not dependent on endosome acidification, consistent with the presence of serine proteinase cleavage sites located adjacent to this epitope (Fig. 5) and with the neutral pH optimum for serine proteinase activity (13Bond J.S. Butler P.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 27Metzler D.E. Biochemistry. The Chemical Reactions of Living Cells. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1977: 353-427Google Scholar). Interestingly, soluble rM5 protein required both serine and cysteine proteinases to facilitate processing of 17–31 for presentation to specific T-cells. In the absence of cysteine proteinase cleavage sites in the vicinity of 17–31, the effect of cysteine proteinases could be restricted to Ii chain proteolysis, which is essential for antigen presentation with newly synthesized MHC-II molecules of the classical antigen processing pathway (1Harding C.V. MHC Molecules and Antigen Processing. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1997Google Scholar, 2Mellman I. Pierre P. Amigorena S. Curr. Opin.

Collectively, the data imply that antigen processing of viable streptococci and soluble rM5 protein for 17–31 presentation occurred largely in different endosomal compartments, early and late endosomes, respectively. Targeting of rM5 to distinct MHC-II processing compartments in this case would be expected if the polypeptide chain of this recombinant protein needed unfolding prior to proteolytic cleavage as has been described for native but not denatured sperm whale myoglobin (21Streicher H.Z. Berkower I.J. Busch M. Gurd R.N. Berzofsky J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6831-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In contrast, the N-terminal 17–31 epitope of the M5 protein expressed on the bacterial cell surface could have been cleaved by plasma membrane-associated endopeptidases as described for processing of bovine serum albumin by the A20 lymphoblastoid cell line (28Chain B.M. Bou-Gharios G. Olsen I. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1989; 75: 87-92PubMed Google Scholar) and routed to early endosomes. It is not clear if presentation of 17–31 after processing of whole bacteria occurred in the context of a large antigen fragment or whether it was trimmed by serine proteinases after binding to MHC-II molecules thus protecting the trypsin-like serine proteinase cleavage site within the epitope (Fig. 5). Processing of 308–319 from both rM5 and bacteria was mediated by serine, cysteine, and aspartic proteinases and was found to be dependent on endosome acidification. The data suggests engagement of late endosomes/lysosomes that provide the necessary acidic environment for acquisition of full enzymatic activity of cysteine and aspartic proteinases (7Berg T. Gjøen T. Bakke O. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 19Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Dependence of 308–319 processing on aspartic proteinases is not consistent with the absence of aspartic proteinase cleavage sites in the vicinity of this epitope, again suggesting that aspartic proteinases exerted an indirect effect on antigen processing via the previously described inhibition of sequential proteolysis of Ii chain from (αβ3)Ii3 complexes (2Mellman I.

Data presented herein indicate that two immunodominant T-cell epitopes on the streptococcal M5 protein engage different endosomal compartments and required different classes of intracellular proteolytic enzymes for antigen processing. Knowledge of the mechanisms of enzymatic cleavage of protective antigens during antigen processing of T-cell epitopes from viable bacteria has important implications for live vaccine delivery systems.

However, several tumor cell types are resistant to TNF-induced effects, and some of these produce TNF. We previously demonstrated that introduction of an exogenous TNF gene in the TNF-sensitive cell line L929sA induced autocrine TNF production and unresponsiveness to the cytotoxic activity of TNF. This resistance required biologically active TNF and was correlated with complete down-modulation of the TNF receptors on the cell surface. We have now characterized this process in more detail. The role of expression of the membrane-bound TNF proform and its subsequent proteolytic processing in the induction of TNF unresponsiveness was investigated. Exchange of the TNF presequence for the signal sequence of interleukin-6 resulted in production of secreted TNF, but not in induction of TNF resistance. On the other hand, expression of non-secretable, membrane-bound TNF generated complete TNF unresponsiveness. To explore whether the requirement for anchoring reflected a specific functional role of the TNF presequence, the latter was replaced by the membrane anchor of trimeric chicken hepatic lectin. Expression of this construct induced complete TNF unresponsiveness. Hence, the role of the TNF presequence in the induction of TNF unresponsiveness only involves its function as a membrane anchor, which permits oligomerization of the TNF molecule into a biologically active homotrimer.

TNF exerts a wide range of biological activities related to inflammation, mitogenesis, differentiation, immune modulation, and antitumor immunity (1Vassalli P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 411-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar, 2Fiers W. DeVita Jr., V.T. Hellman S. Rosenberg S.A. Biologic Therapy of Cancer. 2nd Ed. J. B.

These activities are induced through interaction with specific cell surface receptors expressed on almost every cell type, except unstimulated T-lymphocytes and erythrocytes. In man and mouse, two types of TNF receptor have been characterized, namely TNF-R55 and TNF-R75, with molecular masses of 55 and 75 kDa, respectively. TNF effects are mainly mediated by TNF-R55, whereas the role of TNF-R75 as a signal transducer is mostly confined to T-lymphocytes (4Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W.

Remarkably, transfection with an exogenous TNF gene under a constitutive promoter converts even very sensitive cell lines, like L929, to TNF production and to complete resistance to TNF-induced cytotoxicity; this resistance correlates with and can be explained by the absence of TNF receptors on these cells (16Vanhaesebroeck B. Decoster E. Van Ostade X. Van Bladel S. Lenaerts A. Van Roy F. Fiers W. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2785-2794PubMed Google Scholar). We have now further analyzed this system of complete unresponsiveness. Expression of a TNF gene leads to disappearance from the plasma membrane of TNF-R55 and TNF-R75, despite unaltered levels of corresponding mRNAs. The TNF presequence fulfills a crucial role in this process by its function as a membrane anchor. The fibrosarcoma cell lines L929sA (16Vanhaesebroeck B. Decoster E. Van Ostade X. Van Bladel S. Lenaerts A. Van Roy F. Fiers W. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2785-2794PubMed Google Scholar), L929r2 (17Vanhaesebroeck B. Van Bladel S. Lenaerts A. Suffys P. Beyaert R. Lucas R. Van Roy F. Fiers W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2469-2477PubMed Google Scholar), and WEHI 164 cl 13 (18Espevik T. Nissen-Meyer J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 95: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar) were cultured as described previously. These cell lines were repeatedly screened forMycoplasma by a DNA-fluorochrome assay and were found to be negative. Purified Escherichia coli-derived murine (m) TNF was produced in our laboratory and had a specific biological activity of 2 × 108 IU/mg (international standard according to the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Potters Bar, UK). Recombinant murine interferon (IFN)-β was also produced in our laboratory and had a specific activity of 3 × 108 units/ml, as determined on murine cells in an L929/vesicular stomatitis virus assay. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against mTNF was provided by J. Van der Heyden (Roche Research, Ghent, Belgium). Polyclonal rabbit antiserum directed against amino acid sequence 99–115 (tip region of mTNF; Fig. 2) (19Lucas R. Magez S. De Leys R. Fransen L. Scheerlinck J.-P. Rampelberg M. Sablon E. De Baetselier P. Science. 1994; 263: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Dr. R. Lucas (University Medical Center, Geneva, Switzerland). Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against mTNF-R55 and mTNF-R75 was a kind gift of Dr. W. Buurman (State University of Limburg, Maastricht, The Netherlands). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out with the pMa phasmid, which contains a chloramphenicol-sensitive gene (20Stanssens P. Opsomer C. McKeown Y.M. Kramer W. Zabeau M. Fritz H.-J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4441-4453Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Using two oligonucleotides containing the mutations of interest, a plasmid conferring chloramphenicol resistance was obtained. Mutagenesis was performed with a kit from CLONTECH. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The interleukin (IL)-6.TNF fusion product containing the signal sequence of murine IL-6 (a gift from Dr. J. Van Snick, Ludwig Institute, Brussels, Belgium) and mature mTNF was constructed as follows. First, a unique StuI restriction site was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis in the signal sequence of murine IL-6 (amino acids −24 to −1) at positions −10/−9/−8. The mutated IL-6 gene was then inserted as a bluntedEcoRI-SalI fragment into pSV23s, a eukaryotic expression vector under control of the SV40 early promoter (21Huylebroeck D. Maertens G. Verhoeyen M. Lopez C. Raeymaekers A. Min Jou W. Fiers W. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 163-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which was cleaved with StuI-SalI. A uniqueBglII restriction site was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis at amino acid positions 2 and 3 of mature mTNF; this mutated TNF gene was inserted as a SalI fragment intoSalI-cleaved pSV23s. The pSV23s vector containing the IL-6.TNF chimeric gene was constructed as follows. TheBglII-SalI fragment (containing mature mTNF) was ligated to the StuI-SalI fragment of pSV23smIL6 (containing only the signal sequence of IL-6); in-phase fusion of the two gene parts was achieved by insertion of a synthetic linker coding for amino acids −7 to −1 of the IL-6 signal sequence and the first two amino acids of mature mTNF. The chicken hepatic lectin (CHL).TNF fusion product containing the membrane anchor structure of CHL (a gift from Dr. K. Drickamer, Columbia University, New York, NY) and mature mTNF was constructed as follows. A unique BclI restriction site was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis in pMaCHL at the last amino acid of the neck region of CHL. Then, the CHL membrane anchor was cloned as anEcoRI-BclI fragment into theEcoRI-BglII-cleaved pMacmTNFmBglII vector fragment and fused in-phase with a synthetic linker (containing the last amino acid of the neck region of CHL, the last four amino acids of the TNF presequence, and the first amino acid of mature mTNF) to mature mTNF. The CHL.TNF gene was inserted as a SalI fragment in the SalI site of pSV23s (21Huylebroeck D. Maertens G. Verhoeyen M. Lopez C. Raeymaekers A. Min Jou W. Fiers W. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 163-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The construction of pMx-mTNF was achieved by insertion of the mTNF gene as a SalI fragment in a SalI-cleaved pSP64MxpA vector containing the Mx promoter inducible by IFN type I, either IFN-α or IFN-β (22Lleonart R. Näf D. Browning H. Weissmann C. Bio/Technology. 1990; 8: 1263-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The pSV2neo plasmid encoding the neomycin-resistant (neo r) gene under control of the SV40 early promoter was used as a selection marker in L929 transfections (23Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid used for transfection was purified with columns from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). Stable transfection was achieved by an improved DNA-calcium phosphate co-precipitation method as described previously (16Vanhaesebroeck B. Decoster E. Van Ostade X. Van Bladel S. Lenaerts A. Van Roy F. Fiers W. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2785-2794PubMed Google Scholar). Supernatants of transfected cell lines were concentrated 100-fold by centrifugation in Centriprep-10 and Centricon-10 micro-separation devices (Amicon, Danvers, MA). TNF was quantified in an 18-h cytotoxicity assay using WEHI 164 cl 13 cells in the presence of 1 μg of actinomycin D (ActD)/ml (18Espevik T. Nissen-Meyer J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 95: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). The detection limit of this assay was about 1 pg/ml. These procedures were performed as described (11Decoster E. Vanhaesebroeck B. Vandenabeele P. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18473-18478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17Vanhaesebroeck B. Van Bladel S. Lenaerts A. Suffys P. Beyaert R. Lucas R. Van Roy F. Fiers W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2469-2477PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane-bound TNF was analyzed using polyclonal rabbit antiserum directed against the tip region as described previously (11Decoster E. Vanhaesebroeck B. Vandenabeele P. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18473-18478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The presence of TNF-R55 and TNF-R75 was determined by staining for 1 h at 4 °C with polyclonal rabbit antiserum against TNF-R55 or TNF-R75 (1 μg of antiserum/4 × 105 cells in 200 μl), followed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit polyclonal antiserum (Amersham Life Science, Amersham, UK), and by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin. Analyses were performed by flow fluorocytometry using a Coulter Epics 753 fluorocytometer equipped with an argon-ion laser (Coulter, Hialeah, FL). TNF sensitivity was determined as described previously (17Vanhaesebroeck B. Van Bladel S. Lenaerts A. Suffys P. Beyaert R. Lucas R. Van Roy F. Fiers W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2469-2477PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of IL-6 in unconcentrated supernatants was determined by its capacity to induce proliferation of 7TD1 cells (24Van Snick J. Cayphas S. Vink A. Uyttenhove C. Coulie P.G. Rubira M.R. Simpson R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9679-9683Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB was measured by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Nuclear extracts and binding reactions were carried out as described previously (25Patestos N.P. Haegeman G. Vandevoorde V. Fiers W. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB site from the IL-6 promoter was 32P-labeled; after purification, 50,000 cpm was used for the binding assay. Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated using a FastTrack mRNA Isolation Kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). 5 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA was separated by electrophoresis through a 1.4% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Life Science). The RNA was UV-fixed, and hybridization of the membrane was achieved at 42 °C in the presence of formamide. A 656-base pairBstEII-BamHI fragment of pBLUmTNFR55 and a 1300-base pair BamHI-BglII fragment of pUCmTNFR75 were used as probes. As control for the quantity of RNA loaded, a probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used. Probes were32P-labeled with a Random Primed labeling kit (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany). Transfection of the TNF-sensitive L929 cell line with an exogenous TNF gene induces TNF production and TNF unresponsiveness (16Vanhaesebroeck B. Decoster E. Van Ostade X. Van Bladel S. Lenaerts A. Van Roy F. Fiers W. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2785-2794PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether proteolytic processing of the membrane-bound TNF proform is necessary for the induction of this resistance, we assayed two membrane-bound, non-secretable TNF mutants, which were described previously (11Decoster E. Vanhaesebroeck B. Vandenabeele P. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18473-18478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). TNFΔ1–9K11E, in which, in addition to deletion of the first nine amino acids of mature TNF, Lys at position 11 was replaced by Glu, is a biologically active mutein. The TNF mutant TNFΔ1–12, with deletion of the first 12 amino acids of mature TNF, is considerably less biologically active (11Decoster E. Vanhaesebroeck B. Vandenabeele P. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18473-18478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, L929sA cells transfected with TNFΔ1–12 were partially TNF-resistant, whereas TNFΔ1–9K11E-producing L929sA transfectants became fully resistant to TNF cytotoxicity. This resistance is similar to that observed in L929sA cells transfected with wild-type (wt) TNF, which produce both membrane-bound and secreted TNF. L929sA cells transfected only with aneo r selection marker retained their sensitivity to the cytotoxic activity of TNF. Since TNF also mediates a gene-inducing activity in L929 cells, the latter activity was analyzed by assaying IL-6 production and NF-κB activation. TNF stimulation could not induce IL-6 (Table I) or activate NF-κB (Fig. 1) in wtTNF-producing or TNFΔ1–9K11E-producing L929sA cells, whereas addition of exogenous TNF could still induce IL-6 production in TNFΔ1–12 transfectants (Table I). Given these results, we conclude that TNF does not need to be processed into a soluble, secreted form to induce unresponsiveness to TNF-mediated effects.Table IResponsiveness to TNF of L929sA cells transfected with wtTNF, TNFΔ1–12, or TNFΔ1–9K11ETransfected geneColonyTNF production1-aAssessed in unconcentrated culture supernatant from the cytotoxic activity on the highly TNF-sensitive cell line WEHI 164 cl 13.

Open table in a new tab To express TNF exclusively as a secreted protein, we exchanged the TNF presequence for the classical signal sequence of IL-6 (Fig. 2). Cotransfection of this chimeric IL-6.TNF gene with the neo r gene in L929sA cells and G418 selection yielded only marginal numbers of G418-resistant colonies, none of which produced TNF (data not shown). This failure to isolate IL-6.TNF transfectants suggested that the transfectants were counter-selected, which means that expression of the IL-6.TNF gene resulted in cell death. To verify this hypothesis, the IL-6.TNF gene was transfected in L929r2, a TNF-resistant and non-TNF-producing cell line derived from TNF-sensitive L929 s cells (17Vanhaesebroeck B. Van Bladel S. Lenaerts A. Suffys P. Beyaert R. Lucas R. Van Roy F. Fiers W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2469-2477PubMed Google Scholar). After transfection with the IL-6.TNF gene and G418 selection, a normal number of G418-resistant L929r2 colonies were obtained. These transfectants released between 50 and 350 IU/ml TNF in the culture medium as detected by a cytotoxicity assay. This is higher than observed with L929r2 cells transfected with the wtTNF gene, which constitutively secrete between 1 and 40 IU/ml TNF. Unlike wtTNF-transfected L929r2 cells, no membrane-bound TNF form could be detected in the IL-6.TNF transfectants by flow fluorocytometric analysis (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that expression of the IL-6.TNF chimeric gene gives rise to biologically active TNF, which is produced exclusively as a secretory protein. Furthermore, since IL-6.TNF-producing transfectants were isolated only after transfection of the TNF-resistant L929r2 variant, and not with the TNF-sensitive L929sA cell line, the TNF-mediated counter-selection was presumably the direct cause of the negligible transfection efficiency obtained with L929sA cells. Although L929r2 cells are resistant to the cytotoxic activity of TNF, the cells become sensitive in the presence of ActD or cycloheximide (CHX), inhibitors of RNA or protein synthesis, respectively (17Vanhaesebroeck B. Van Bladel S. Lenaerts A. Suffys P. Beyaert R. Lucas R. Van Roy F. Fiers W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2469-2477PubMed Google Scholar). This feature allowed us to study whether the secreted IL-6.TNF chimera and wtTNF expressed in L929r2 differ in the induction of resistance to the cytotoxic combination of TNF and ActD, CHX, or staurosporine. The latter is a nonspecific protein kinase C inhibitor, which also sensitizes L929r2 cells to TNF effects (26Beyaert R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Heyninck K. Boone E. De Valck D. Schulze-Osthoff K. Haegeman G. Van Roy F. Fiers W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2623-2630PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Table II, IL-6.TNF transfectants exhibited extensive cell death after treatment with ActD, CHX, or staurosporine alone. Apparently, these cells were killed as a result of the combined activity of autocrine-produced TNF and sensitizing agents. In contrast to this, wtTNF transfectants, producing both membrane-bound and secreted TNF, exhibited full resistance to the sensitizing drugs alone or supplemented with exogenous TNF (Table II). A similar differential responsiveness was observed by following the induction of IL-6. In agreement with the observation that L929r2 cells still respond to TNF by producing IL-6, introduction of the constitutively expressed IL-6.TNF chimeric gene induced high levels of IL-6 production in the transfectants (an autocrine stimulation), whereas introduction of the wtTNF gene eliminated the inducible IL-6 response observed in the control transfectants (Table II). Clearly, omission of the intermediary step of the membrane-bound proform in the course of TNF biosynthesis abolished the capacity of endogenously produced TNF to generate unresponsiveness.Table IIResponsiveness to TNF of L929r2 cells transfected with wtTNF or chimeric IL-6.TNFTransfected geneColonySurvival2-aCells were treated with ActD (1 μg/ml), CHX (25 μg/ml), or staurosporine (STS, 1.5 μm) in the absence of exogenous TNF.

Open table in a new tab The requirement for membrane retention in the induction of unresponsiveness to TNF implies an involvement of the TNF presequence either structurally, as a membrane anchor, or functionally, involving (signal-transducing) amino acid sequence information. To answer this question, we exchanged the TNF presequence for the membrane anchor of CHL (27Mellow T.E. Halberg D. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5468-5473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHL is a trimeric, type II transmembrane liver glycoprotein receptor (28Chiacchia K.B. Drickamer K. J. Biol.

Transfection of L929sA cells with the CHL.TNF chimeric construct (Fig. 2) yielded a normal number of colonies, all of which secreted high amounts of biologically active TNF, varying within the range of 30–300 IU/ml (Table III). These L929sA transfectants were completely unresponsive to the cytotoxic and gene-inducing activity of TNF, which means that they behaved in the same way as L929sA cells transfected with the wtTNF gene (Table III).Table IIICharacterization of L929sA cells transfected with wtTNF or CHL.TNFTransfected geneColonyTNF production3-aAssessed in unconcentrated culture supernatant.TNF sensitivity3-bUnits required to obtain 50% cell death within 18 h in the presence of ActD; > means that 50% cell death was not observed with the indicated TNF concentration.IL-6 production3-cAssessed in the supernatant of L929sA transfectants after 24 h of culture either untreated or treated with 40,000 IU/ml TNF.None+ TNFIU/mlIU/mlpg/mlneo rB1<0.12<106000B2<0.12<107000neo r + wtTNFC225>40,000<10<10C37>40,000<10<10neo r+ CHL.TNFD2250>40,000<10<10D3100>40,000<10<103-a Assessed in unconcentrated culture supernatant.3-b Units required to obtain 50% cell death within 18 h in the presence of ActD; > means that 50% cell death was not observed with the indicated TNF concentration.3-c Assessed in the supernatant of L929sA transfectants after 24 h of culture either untreated or treated with 40,000 IU/ml TNF.

The presence of membrane-bound fusion protein was also confirmed by flow fluorocytometric analysis, where the levels of immunofluorescence remained unchanged after acidic treatment, which removes receptor-bound, soluble TNF (Fig. 5). In the culture supernatant, mature TNF as well as several highM r forms were detected (Fig. 4 B). The latter bands were due to N-glycosylation, as they disappeared after glycopeptidase F treatment (data not shown).Figure 5Flow-cytometric analysis of expression of membrane-bound TNF by L929sA transfectants.

CDC37 also binds DNA and glycosaminoglycans in a sequence-specific manner. In this study, we further characterize chick CDC37 and examine the organization of the CDC37 gene. Chick CDC37 is a ∼50-kDa protein encoded by an mRNA of ∼1.7 kilobases. The CDC37 gene is ∼8.5 kilobases and contains 8 exons and 7 introns of various sizes. The presumptive promoter and 5′-flanking regions contain an E2 box and consensus binding sites for SP1, for the S8 homeodomain protein, and for two zinc finger clusters within the myeloid progenitor transcription factor, MZF1. Particularly striking is a ∼470-base pair region composed of a highly repetitive 10–11-base pair sequence, (T/C)gCTAT(A/G)GGG(A/T) (where g represents the additional G present in the 11-base pair sequence). This region includes 15 copies of the sequence, TATGGGGA, which conforms to the DNA consensus sequence recognized by one of the zinc finger clusters in MZF1. These findings emphasize the potential importance of CDC37 in regulation of cellular behavior during tissue development and reorganization."

The data were consistent with a model involving two binding sites of different affinities for the toxins. The occupancy of the high affinity site (or tight site) gave rise to an inactive complex, whereas filling both sites (tight + loose) gave rise to a complex of variable activity, dependent on the toxin analogue. Competition experiments between tentoxin and nonreactivating analogues allowed discrimination between the absence of binding and a nonproductive binding to the site of lower affinity (or loose site). The affinity for the loose site was not affected significantly by the modifications of the tentoxin molecule, whereas the affinity for the tight site was found notably changed. Increasing the size of side chain 1 or 2 and introducing a net electrical charge both resulted in a decrease of affinity for the tight site, but the second change dominated the first one. The activity of different ternary complexes enzyme-tentoxin-analogue depended on the nature of the toxin bound on each site and not only on that bound on the loose site. This demonstrates that the reactivation process results from an interaction, direct or not, between these two binding sites. Possible molecular mechanisms are discussed.

At these same concentrations, the effect observed on membrane-bound ATPase (F0F1 complex) is restricted to a partial release of inhibition, but the reactivated F0F1complex recovers the ability to couple proton transport to ATP synthesis (24Sigalat C. Pitard B. Haraux F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). TTX dramatically disturbs the interactions among different nucleotide sites of ATPase, whatever the toxin concentration range (25Fromme P. Dahse I. Gräber P. Z.

Simultaneous perturbation of these interactions and preservation of proton coupling in the TTX-reactivated form are intriguing in the context of rotational catalysis. Understanding the inhibitory and reactivating properties of TTX is therefore one of the elements that may contribute to the elucidation of the mechanism of energy coupling.It has been demonstrated (27Pinet E.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that CF1 binds two molecules of TTX on two sites of different affinities, which could be related to the inhibitory and reactivating effects of this molecule. These binding sites have not yet been identified, and the reasons for the specificity of TTX for the CF1-ATP synthase of some higher plants remain obscure (23Dahse I. Pezennec S. Girault D. Berger G.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1242-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which proves that the γ, δ, ε subunits are not required for the stimulation effect of TTX but suggests that they could be necessary for the inhibition.We have shown recently (30Pinet E. Cavelier F. Verducci J. Girault G. Dubart L. Haraux F. Sigalat C. André F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12804-12811Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) that a very limited change in the molecule of TTX (replacement of l-MeAla1 byl-MeSer1) resulted in a dramatic loss of the reactivating effect at high concentrations, although the inhibitory effect at lower concentrations was unaffected. This led to the idea that it was possible to discriminate inhibitory and activating effects by an appropriate set of molecules derived from TTX. Because high concentrations of MeSer1-TTX were able to prevent CF1-ATPase reactivation by high concentrations of TTX, we proposed that MeSer1-TTX could bind the reactivating site competitively with TTX, giving rise to a poorly active form of the enzyme. However, it cannot be excluded that MeSer1-TTX prevents reactivation simply by chasing TTX from the high affinity site. The question was whether the stimulation by TTX only involves the low affinity binding site or the two binding sites of CF1. To get information about possible cooperation among TTX binding sites, we have used a kinetic approach consisting of studying the catalytic properties of ternary complexes formed by CF1-ε and different TTX analogues. This approach involves various combinations of analogues of different affinities for the inhibitory site and able or not to reactivate the enzyme at high concentrations. The results suggested that both binding sites participate in the formation of the reactivated state. At the same time, we were able to characterize the binding and effector properties of the set of TTX analogues modified in various positions. This allowed us to make hypotheses about the domains of the TTX molecule which are important for binding, inhibition, and stimulation.

An essential feature of this model is that the cooperative functioning among the three catalytic sites is strictly related to the rotation of the γ subunit and thus to the proton pumping activity.

Phytopathology. 1977; 67: 602-603Crossref Google Scholar). It specifically inhibits ATP synthesis in isolated chloroplasts (19Steele J.A. Uchytil T.F. Durbin R.D. Bhatnagar P.K. Rich D.H. Proc. Natl.

At these same concentrations, the effect observed on membrane-bound ATPase (F0F1 complex) is restricted to a partial release of inhibition, but the reactivated F0F1complex recovers the ability to couple proton transport to ATP synthesis (24Sigalat C. Pitard B. Haraux F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). TTX dramatically disturbs the interactions among different nucleotide sites of ATPase, whatever the toxin concentration range (25Fromme P. Dahse I. Gräber P. Z. Naturforsch. 1992; 47c: 239-244Google Scholar, 26Hu N. Mills D.A. Huchzermeyer B. Richter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8536-8540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Simultaneous perturbation of these interactions and preservation of proton coupling in the TTX-reactivated form are intriguing in the context of rotational catalysis. Understanding the inhibitory and reactivating properties of TTX is therefore one of the elements that may contribute to the elucidation of the mechanism of energy coupling. It has been demonstrated (27Pinet E. Gomis J.-M. Girault G. Cavelier F. Verducci J. Noël J.-P. André F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that CF1 binds two molecules of TTX on two sites of different affinities, which could be related to the inhibitory and reactivating effects of this molecule. These binding sites have not yet been identified, and the reasons for the specificity of TTX for the CF1-ATP synthase of some higher plants remain obscure (23Dahse I. Pezennec S. Girault D. Berger G. André F. Liebermann B. J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 143: 615-620Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 28Avni A. Anderson J.D. Holland N. Rochaix J.-D. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Edelman M. Science. 1992; 257: 1245-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). TTX stabilizes and enhances the ATPase activity of an α3β3 complex from spinach CF1 (29Sokolov M. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1242-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which proves that the γ, δ, ε subunits are not required for the stimulation effect of TTX but suggests that they could be necessary for the inhibition. We have shown recently (30Pinet E. Cavelier F. Verducci J. Girault G. Dubart L. Haraux F. Sigalat C. André F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12804-12811Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) that a very limited change in the molecule of TTX (replacement of l-MeAla1 byl-MeSer1) resulted in a dramatic loss of the reactivating effect at high concentrations, although the inhibitory effect at lower concentrations was unaffected. This led to the idea that it was possible to discriminate inhibitory and activating effects by an appropriate set of molecules derived from TTX. Because high concentrations of MeSer1-TTX were able to prevent CF1-ATPase reactivation by high concentrations of TTX, we proposed that MeSer1-TTX could bind the reactivating site competitively with TTX, giving rise to a poorly active form of the enzyme. However, it cannot be excluded that MeSer1-TTX prevents reactivation simply by chasing TTX from the high affinity site. The question was whether the stimulation by TTX only involves the low affinity binding site or the two binding sites of CF1. To get information about possible cooperation among TTX binding sites, we have used a kinetic approach consisting of studying the catalytic properties of ternary complexes formed by CF1-ε and different TTX analogues. This approach involves various combinations of analogues of different affinities for the inhibitory site and able or not to reactivate the enzyme at high concentrations. The results suggested that both binding sites participate in the formation of the reactivated state. At the same time, we were able to characterize the binding and effector properties of the set of TTX analogues modified in various positions. This allowed us to make hypotheses about the domains of the TTX molecule which are important for binding, inhibition, and stimulation. We thank Véronique Mary for extraction of the spinach chloroplast F1-ATPase. We are indebted to Drs. Florine Cavelier and Jean Verducci for the chemical synthesis of tentoxin and all of its analogues. Dr. Catherine Berthomieu performed the FTIR analysis of tentoxin solutions."
