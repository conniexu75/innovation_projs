https://openalex.org/W1981052551,"The details of the process by which cells sort out and reconstruct tissues within aggregates containing two kinds of tissue cells have been correctly predicted from considerations of the kinetic and adhesive properties of such cells. The requisite properties are discreteness, motility, and differential mutual adhesiveness among the types of cells present."

The chasm between Eskimos and Caucasians in isoniazid metabolism is bridged by our investigation of the races in the Far East."

https://openalex.org/W2066813252,"IN the family Enterobacteriaceae, the genus Erwinia has been divided into those which cause dry necroses, galls or wilts in plants, and those which produce the enzyme protopectinase and cause soft-rots in plants1. The latter group has been given the name Pectobacterium by Waldee2."

https://openalex.org/W1965127662,"Treated with Gonadotrophin Thirty-two-day-old female rats, injected two days previously with gonadotrophin from pregnant mares' serum, were given barbiturate at different times during the afternoon to determine whether the ovulation that would occur the next day could be blocked. The results indicate that ovulation depends upon release of pituitary ovulating hormone during a""critical period"" between 2 and 4 P.M."
https://openalex.org/W2019250800,"Congenital myotonia, similar to that which has been reported in humans and in goats, is here reported for the first time in another species. Evidence is given to show (i) that the myotonic phenomenon is present despite complete block of neuromuscular transmission; (ii) prior to injection of curare, synchronous activity of muscle fibers may result not only from ephaptic stimulation of neighboring fibers but also from reflex firing; and (iii) water deprivation does not relieve the myotonia."

https://openalex.org/W2783901819,"WHILE examining a method for the isolation of haptoglobin by chromatography on DEAE cellulose1 we noticed that several α1- and α2-globulins were adsorbed under the experimental conditions used. One of these proteins, an α2-glycoprotein, has now been obtained at about 90 per cent purity. The protein adsorbed together with haptoglobin, cæruloplasmin, cholinesterase and some α1-globulins at pH 5.0 from human plasma diluted to a freezing point of − 0.15° is the last of these proteins to be eluted at the same pH but with increasing molarity of acetate buffer. Indeed, haptoglobin is eluted at 0.1 M acetate buffer, cæruloplasmin together with some α1-globulin at 0.2 M and the unknown protein at 0.3–0.4 M."

https://openalex.org/W2050967031,"The sex chromatin pattern in two series of newborn babies comprising 2058 males and 1832 females was studied to find the incidence of sex chromatin anomalies. We did not detect a single case of sex chromatin discordance when compared with the phenotypical sex. In this respect our survey differed from similar surveys in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland."
https://openalex.org/W1992901763,"ELECTROPHORETIC investigations have indicated differences in glycoprotein pattern between serum and synovial fluid1–3. The most marked difference is that the relative amount of α2-glycoproteins is considerably less in synovial fluid than in serum. It was recently demonstrated4 that the low α2-content of rheumatoid arthritic synovial fluid is mainly due to the low concentration of haptoglobin. The synovial fluid–serum ratio for this glycoprotein was significantly lower than for albumin or γ-globulin. The concentration of the small-molecular glycoprotein orosomucoid was, on the other hand, that expected from the total protein content, indicating a varied permeability of the blood-synovial fluid barrier to glycoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W2029619470,"Chlorpromazine was found to have an antagonistic action against the electroencephalographic (EEG) alerting produced in rabbits by cholinergic agents, particularly eserine salycilate and acetylcholine chloride. This cholinolytic action occurs at a prepontine, precollicular level where adrenergic agents fail to elicit EEG alerting. These results emphasize the importance of cholinergic mechanisms in EEG alerting."

https://openalex.org/W1994266246,"Ten subjects with epilepsy were trained to press a lever to avoid a mildly painful shock each time paroxysmal epileptiform activity occurred in their own electroencephalogram. All subjects learned to avoid the shock as long as they could hear the electroencephalogram and respond to the characteristic change in sound accompanying each spike-wave burst. When the audio component of the electroencephalogram was eliminated, only one subject was able to respond to the purely subjective effect of his own paroxysmal activity."

https://openalex.org/W2054265323,"THE preputial gland of the adult female rat has been shown by Beyler and Szego1 to be an extremely rich source of β-glucuronidase. However, it may not generally be realized that laboratories needing a steady supply of this enzyme and having access to a rat colony have a cheap and readily available source. Adult female rats which are being discarded can be used, and the two glands, each weighing approximately 50 mgm., are easily dissected free from the surrounding tissue (Fig. 1)."
https://openalex.org/W2099228918,"The temperature scale used by scientists in America has been called centigrade, while in many countries it was called Celsius for its inventor. In 1948 the 9th General Conference on Weights and Measures, representing 33 nations that subscribed to the Treaty of the Meter, adopted the name Celsius. This name, however, did not come into general use by scientists in America, partly because they were unaware of the official action of the conference and partly because some preferred the old name. At the 11th General Conference in 1960 the scale was defined in a way that makes the adjective centigrade inexact. The name Celsius is correct and its use by American scientists would help make the nomenclature of temperature uniform in all countries."

https://openalex.org/W1990939044,"IN a series of recent articles, the separation of mixtures of barbiturates1,2 and of morphine, codeine and N-allylnormorphine3 was described. These separations were carried out by reversed phase paper chromatography both at room temperature and at temperatures up to 86° C., with an aqueous inorganic salt solution as solvent. This work has now been extended to include the ‘neutral’ drugs and certain basic alkaloids and has been applied to extracts of human tissues. By means of this technique it has been found possible to separate the various fractions obtained in systematic toxicological analysis at one and the same time, that is, chromatography of all fractions is carried out simultaneously with the one solvent on one sheet of paper. The chromatography takes only 20 min. to effect resolution of the applied compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1964550720,"Rosenthal and Libby1 have shown that the tuberculin reaction to a 10 T.U. test is reduced by a simultaneous 100 T.U. test. They suggest that there is competition for the available antibody. Stone and Bruce2 and Bruce3 assumed, implicitly, that simultaneous tests are independent and, explicitly, that there is a constant antibody level λ throughout an intradermal reaction. Both assumptions were inessential and the following extension provides a quantitative treatment of simultaneous test data."
