https://openalex.org/W2149472502,"Granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages of the myeloid lineage are the chief cellular agents of innate immunity. Here, we have examined the inflammatory response in mice with conditional knockouts of the hypoxia responsive transcription factor HIF-1alpha, its negative regulator VHL, and a known downstream target, VEGF. We find that activation of HIF-1alpha is essential for myeloid cell infiltration and activation in vivo through a mechanism independent of VEGF. Loss of VHL leads to a large increase in acute inflammatory responses. Our results show that HIF-1alpha is essential for the regulation of glycolytic capacity in myeloid cells: when HIF-1alpha is absent, the cellular ATP pool is drastically reduced. The metabolic defect results in profound impairment of myeloid cell aggregation, motility, invasiveness, and bacterial killing. This role for HIF-1alpha demonstrates its direct regulation of survival and function in the inflammatory microenvironment."

https://openalex.org/W2119835435,"Finding one's way in a large-scale environment may engage different cognitive processes than following a familiar route. The neural bases of these processes were investigated using functional MRI (fMRI). Subjects found their way in one virtual-reality town and followed a well-learned route in another. In a control condition, subjects followed a visible trail. Within subjects, accurate wayfinding activated the right posterior hippocampus. Between-subjects correlations with performance showed that good navigators (i.e., accurate wayfinders) activated the anterior hippocampus during wayfinding and head of caudate during route following. These results coincide with neurophysiological evidence for distinct response (caudate) and place (hippocampal) representations supporting navigation. We argue that the type of representation used influences both performance and concomitant fMRI activation patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2168319429,"Plasticity of the nervous system is dependent on mechanisms that regulate the strength of synaptic transmission. Excitatory synapses in the brain undergo long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), cellular models of learning and memory. Protein phosphorylation is required for the induction of many forms of synaptic plasticity, including LTP and LTD. However, the critical kinase substrates that mediate plasticity have not been identified. We previously reported that phosphorylation of the GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptors, which mediate rapid excitatory transmission in the brain, is modulated during LTP and LTD. To test if GluR1 phosphorylation is necessary for plasticity and learning and memory, we generated mice with knockin mutations in the GluR1 phosphorylation sites. The phosphomutant mice show deficits in LTD and LTP and have memory defects in spatial learning tasks. These results demonstrate that phosphorylation of GluR1 is critical for LTD and LTP expression and the retention of memories."

https://openalex.org/W2113478190,"Boundary elements hinder the spread of heterochromatin, yet these sites do not fully account for the preservation of adjacent euchromatin. Histone variant H2A.Z (Htz1 in yeast) replaces conventional H2A in many nucleosomes. Microarray analysis revealed that HTZ1-activated genes cluster near telomeres. The reduced expression of most of these genes in htz1Delta cells was reversed by the deletion of SIR2 (sir2Delta) suggesting that H2A.Z antagonizes telomeric silencing. Other Htz1-activated genes flank the silent HMR mating-type locus. Their requirement for Htz1 can be bypassed by sir2Delta or by a deletion encompassing the silencing nucleation sites in HMR. In htz1Delta cells, Sir2 and Sir3 spread into flanking euchromatic regions, producing changes in histone H4 acetylation and H3 4-methylation indicative of ectopic heterochromatin formation. Htz1 is enriched in these euchromatic regions and acts synergistically with a boundary element to prevent the spread of heterochromatin. Thus, euchromatin and heterochromatin each contains components that antagonize switching to the opposite chromatin state."

https://openalex.org/W2116247281,"Granzyme A (GzmA) induces a caspase-independent cell death pathway characterized by single-stranded DNA nicks and other features of apoptosis. A GzmA-activated DNase (GAAD) is in an ER associated complex containing pp32 and the GzmA substrates SET, HMG-2, and Ape1. We show that GAAD is NM23-H1, a nucleoside diphosphate kinase implicated in suppression of tumor metastasis, and its specific inhibitor (IGAAD) is SET. NM23-H1 binds to SET and is released from inhibition by GzmA cleavage of SET. After GzmA loading or CTL attack, SET and NM23-H1 translocate to the nucleus and SET is degraded, allowing NM23-H1 to nick chromosomal DNA. GzmA-treated cells with silenced NM23-H1 expression are resistant to GzmA-mediated DNA damage and cytolysis, while cells overexpressing NM23-H1 are more sensitive."
https://openalex.org/W1992912767,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has received particular attention in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer, although the underlying mechanism remains elusive. This study revealed that IL-6 promotes in vivo tumor growth of human cervical cancer C33A cells, but does not substantially alter their in vitro growth kinetics. The in vivo angiogenic assays showed that IL-6 increases angiogenic activity in human cervical cancer cells, an effect that is specifically associated with upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Also, using anti-VEGF antibody to block VEGF function significantly inhibited IL-6-mediated angiogenesis and tumor growth in nude mice, strongly supporting the critical role of VEGF in the IL-6-mediated cervical tumorigenesis. Accordingly, the signaling pathway downstream of IL-6/IL-6R responsible for the regulation of VEGF was investigated. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of PI3-K or MAPK failed to inhibit IL-6-mediated transcriptional upregulation of VEGF. Meanwhile, blocking STAT3 pathway with dominant-negative mutant STAT3D effectively abolished IL-6-induced VEGF mRNA. In transient transfections, a luciferase reporter construct containing the full-length 1.5-kb VEGF promoter or a 1.2-kb fragment lacking the known hypoxic-response element also exhibited the same degree of response to IL-6. Additionally, transient transfection of STAT3D downregulated the 1.2-kb VEGF promoter luciferase reporter stimulated by IL-6. Based on the above phenomenon combined with the concomitant increased tumor expression of IL-6 and VEGF in cervical cancer tissues, we conclude that IL-6 may promote cervical tumorigenesis by activating VEGF-mediated angiogenesis via a STAT3 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2156470803,"Growth factor receptors activate Ras by recruiting the nucleotide exchange factor son of sevenless (SOS) to the cell membrane, thereby triggering the production of GTP-loaded Ras. Crystallographic analyses of Ras bound to the catalytic module of SOS have led to the unexpected discovery of a highly conserved Ras binding site on SOS that is located distal to the active site and is specific for Ras.GTP. The crystal structures suggest that Ras.GTP stabilizes the active site of SOS allosterically, and we show that Ras.GTP forms ternary complexes with SOS(cat) in solution and increases significantly the rate of SOS(cat)-stimulated nucleotide release from Ras. These results demonstrate the existence of a positive feedback mechanism for the spatial and temporal regulation of Ras."
https://openalex.org/W1983433674,"Attention increases the contrast gain of V4 neurons, causing them to respond to an attended stimulus as though its contrast had increased. When multiple stimuli appear within a neuron's receptive field (RF), the neuron responds primarily to the attended stimulus. This suggests that cortical cells may be ""hard wired"" to respond preferentially to the highest-contrast stimulus in their RF, and neural systems for attention capitalize on this mechanism by dynamically increasing the effective contrast of the stimulus that is task relevant. To test this, we varied the relative contrast of two stimuli within the recorded neurons' RFs, while the monkeys attended away to another location. Increasing the physical contrast of one stimulus caused V4 neurons to respond preferentially to that stimulus and reduced their responses to competing stimuli. When attention was directed to the lower-contrast stimulus, it partially overcame the influence of a competing, higher-contrast stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W2104082208,"Dot1 is an evolutionarily conserved histone methyltransferase that methylates lysine-79 of histone H3 in the core domain. Unlike other histone methyltransferases, Dot1 does not contain a SET domain, and it specifically methylates nucleosomal histone H3. We have solved a 2.5 A resolution structure of the catalytic domain of human Dot1, hDOT1L, in complex with S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). The structure reveals a unique organization of a mainly alpha-helical N-terminal domain and a central open alpha/beta structure, an active site consisting of a SAM binding pocket, and a potential lysine binding channel. We also show that a flexible, positively charged region at the C terminus of the catalytic domain is critical for nucleosome binding and enzymatic activity. These structural and biochemical analyses, combined with molecular modeling, provide mechanistic insights into the catalytic mechanism and nucleosomal specificity of Dot1 proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2166198383,"During nervous system development, neurons form reproducible synapses onto specific targets. Here, we analyze the development of stereotyped synapses of the C. elegans HSNL neuron in vivo. Postsynaptic neurons and muscles were not required for accurate synaptic vesicle clustering in HSNL. Instead, vulval epithelial cells that contact HSNL act as synaptic guidepost cells that direct HSNL presynaptic vesicles to adjacent regions. The mutant syg-1(ky652) has defects in synapse formation that resemble those in animals that lack vulval epithelial cells: HSNL synaptic vesicles fail to accumulate at normal synaptic locations and form ectopic anterior clusters. syg-1 encodes an immunoglobulin superfamily protein that acts in the presynaptic HSNL axon. SYG-1 protein is localized to the site of future synapses, where it initiates synapse formation and localizes synaptic connections in response to the epithelial signal. SYG-1 is related to Drosophila IrreC and vertebrate NEPH1 proteins, which mediate cell-cell recognition in diverse developmental contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2012347071,"It has been suggested that microglial inflammation augments the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, endogenous factors initiating microglial activation are largely unknown. We therefore investigated the effects of human neuromelanin (NM) on the release of neurotoxic mediators and the underlying signaling pathways from rat microglia in vitro. The addition of NM to microglial cultures induced positive chemotactic effects, activated the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) via phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitor protein kappaB (IkappaB), and led to an up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, and nitric oxide. The impairment of NF-kappaB function by the IkappaB kinase inhibitor sulfasalazine was paralleled by a decline in neurotoxic mediators. NM also activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the inhibition of this pathway by SB203580 diminished phosphorylation of the transactivation domain of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB. These findings demonstrate a crucial role of NM in the pathogenesis of PD by augmentation of microglial activation, leading to a vicious cycle of neuronal death, exposure of additional neuromelanin, and chronification of inflammation. The antagonization of microglial activation by a pharmacological intervention targeting microglial NF-kappaB or p38 MAPK could point to additional venues in the treatment of PD."
https://openalex.org/W2169103594,"The vomeronasal organ (VNO) of the mouse has two neuronal compartments expressing distinct families of pheromone receptors, the V1Rs and the V2Rs. We report here that two families of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ib molecules, the M10 and the M1 families, show restricted expression in V2R-expressing neurons. Our data suggest that neurons expressing a given V2R specifically co-express one or a few members of the M10 family. Biochemical and immunocytochemical analysis demonstrates that in VNO sensory dendrites M10s belong to large multi-molecular complexes that include pheromone receptors and beta2-microglobulin (beta2m). In cultured cells, M10s appear to function as escort molecules in transport of V2Rs to the cell surface. Accordingly, beta2m-deficient mice exhibit mislocalization of V2Rs in the VNO and a specific defect in male-male aggressive behavior. The functional characterization of M10 highlights an unexpected role for MHC molecules in pheromone detection by mammalian VNO neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1985266648,"The ex vivo effects of passive mechanical stretch on the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathways in skeletal muscles from normal and mdx mouse, a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), were investigated. The NF-kappaB/DNA binding activity of the diaphragm muscle was increased by the application of axial mechanical stretch in a time-dependent manner. The increased activation of NF-kappaB was associated with a concomitant increase in I-kappaB (IkappaB) kinase activity and the degradation of IkappaBalpha protein. Pretreatment of the muscles with nifedipine (a Ca2+ channel blocker) and gadolinium(III) chloride (a stretch-activated channel blocker) did not alter the level of activation of NF-kappaB, ruling out involvement of Ca2+ influx through these channels. Furthermore, N-acetyl cysteine, a free radical inhibitor, blocked the mechanical stretch-induced NF-kappaB activation, suggesting the involvement of free radicals. Compared with normal diaphragm, the basal level of NF-kappaB activity was higher in muscles from mdx mice, and it was further enhanced in mechanically stretched muscles. Furthermore, activation of NF-kappaB and increased expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha in the mdx mouse precede the onset of muscular dystrophy. Our results show that mechanical stretch activates the classical NF-kappaB pathway and this pathway could be predominately active in DMD."
https://openalex.org/W2026769136,"We used representational difference analysis to identify homozygous genomic deletions selected during tumor progression in the mouse NF2 and TP53 tumor model. We describe a deletion targeting DOCK4, a member of the CDM gene family encoding regulators of small GTPases. DOCK4 specifically activates Rap GTPase, enhancing the formation of adherens junctions. DOCK4 mutations are present in a subset of human cancer cell lines; a recurrent missense mutant identified in human prostate and ovarian cancers encodes a protein that is defective in Rap1 activation. The engulfment defect of C. elegans mutants lacking the CDM gene ced-5 is rescued by wild-type DOCK4, but not by the mutant allele. Expression of wild-type, but not mutant, DOCK4 in mouse osteosarcoma cells with a deletion of the endogenous gene suppresses growth in soft agar and tumor invasion in vivo. DOCK4 therefore encodes a CDM family member that regulates intercellular junctions and is disrupted during tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1965370880,"Spike synchronization across neurons can be selective for the situation where neurons are driven at similar firing rates, a ""many are equal"" computation. This can be achieved in the absence of synaptic interactions between neurons, through phase locking to a common underlying oscillatory potential. Based on this principle, we instantiate an algorithm for robust odor recognition into a model network of spiking neurons whose main features are taken from known properties of biological olfactory systems. Here, recognition of odors is signaled by spike synchronization of specific subsets of ""mitral cells."" This synchronization is highly odor selective and invariant to a wide range of odor concentrations. It is also robust to the presence of strong distractor odors, thus allowing odor segmentation within complex olfactory scenes. Information about odors is encoded in both the identity of glomeruli activated above threshold (1 bit of information per glomerulus) and in the analog degree of activation of the glomeruli (approximately 3 bits per glomerulus)."

https://openalex.org/W1989275902,"Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) comprise up to 8% of the human genome. In previous studies, we demonstrated that type 1 HERV-K envelope (env) transcripts are expressed in most human breast cancers, but not in normal breast tissues. In the current study, we report that type 2 HERV-K env transcripts are also present in human breast cancers. By real-time RT–PCR, the expression of HERV-K env transcripts was 5–10-fold higher in breast cancer cell lines treated with estradiol and progesterone than in cells without treatment, and expression was significantly higher in most breast cancer tissues than in normal breast tissues. Furthermore, both types of HERV-K env transcripts were capable of being spliced into subgenomic env transcripts and various splice donor and acceptor sites were detected in breast cancers. The selective expression and distribution of multiple HERV-K endogenous retroviral element splice variants in breast cancer, but not in normal controls, suggests that they are novel breast tumor markers."

https://openalex.org/W2005189059,"CD44 is the major adhesion molecule for the extracellular matrix components and is implicated in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes including the regulation of tumor cell growth and metastasis. Our previous studies have shown that CD44 undergoes sequential proteolytic cleavages in the extracellular and transmembrane domains and the cleavage product derived from CD44 intramembranous cleavage acts as a signal transduction molecule. However, the underlying mechanism of the intramembranous cleavage of CD44 remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we report for the first time that CD44 is a substrate of the presenilin (PS)-dependent gamma-secretase. We demonstrate that the intramembranous cleavage of CD44 induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) treatment or mechanical scraping is blocked by gamma-secretase inhibitors in U251MG cells and that this cleavage is also inhibited in PS-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Furthermore, we showed that PS1 is redistributed to ruffling areas of the plasma membrane similarly to CD44 after TPA treatment, supporting our biochemical observation that PS1 is involved in the intramembranous cleavage of CD44. Our present findings suggest important implications for understanding CD44-dependent signal transduction and a potential role of PS/gamma-secretase activity in the functional regulation of adhesion molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2032616537,"Wnts comprise a family of secreted proteins that interact with receptors consisting of a Frizzled (Fz) family member alone or complexed with LDL receptor-related proteins (LRP5/6). Wnt signaling plays a crucial role in both development and differentiation, and activation of a 'canonical' Wnt pathway resulting in beta-catenin stabilization is associated with several types of human cancers. To date, little is known about potential Wnt signaling in mature lymphocytes or lymphoid neoplasia. Herein, we have analysed Wnt signaling in mature B cells (lymphomas) and plasma cells (multiple myeloma). Both Fz and LRP5/6 mRNAs were expressed in myeloma lines, but LRP5/6 were not observed in lymphomas. In myelomas, a canonical Wnt signaling pathway was activated following treatment with Wnt-3a as assessed by accumulation of beta-catenin, but beta-catenin levels actually decreased in lymphoma cells. Wnt-3a treatment further led to striking morphological changes in myeloma cells accompanied by rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. Morphological changes were associated with a second Wnt pathway dependent on Rho activation. These results suggest that Wnt responsiveness is a stage-specific phenomenon in B-cell development and that the morphological changes associated with Wnt signaling may play a role in the motility and metastatic potential of myeloma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2077178117,"While studying Bim, a BH3-only proapoptotic protein, we identified an approximately 36 kDa protein, which was abundantly expressed in all five strains of primary normal human prostate (NHP) epithelial cells but significantly reduced or lost in seven prostate cancer cell lines. The approximately 36 kDa protein was subsequently identified as annexin II by proteomic approach and confirmed by Western blotting using an annexin II-specific antibody. Conventional and 2D SDS-PAGE, together with Western blotting, also revealed reduced or lost expression of annexin I in prostate cancer cells. Subcellular localization studies revealed that in NHP cells, annexin II was distributed both in the cytosol and underneath the plasma membrane, but not on the cell surface. Prostate cancer cells showed reduced levels as well as altered expression patterns of annexin II. Since annexins play important roles in maintaining Ca(2+) homeostasis and regulating the cytoskeleton and cell motility, we hypothesized that the reduced or lost expression of annexin I/II might promote certain aggressive phenotypes of prostate cancer cells. In subsequent experiments, we indeed observed that restoration of annexin II expression inhibited the migration of the transfected prostate cancer cells without affecting cell proliferation or apoptosis. Hence, our results suggest that annexin II, and, likely, annexin I, may be endogenous suppressors of prostate cancer cell migration and their reduced or lost expression may contribute to prostate cancer development and progression."
https://openalex.org/W2151484351,"The retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein is an important regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation. Many studies have shown that pRb can negatively regulate the activity of the E2F family of transcription factors during G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle, perhaps by serving as a bridge between the E2Fs and transcriptional repressors such as histone deacetylases and methylases. However, pRb has also been shown to localize to discrete DNA foci during S phase, a time at which pRb is thought to be dissociated from E2F. Numerous other DNA binding proteins have been shown to interact with pRb, suggesting that pRb may control progression through S phase by binding to sites in the genome distinct from E2F target gene promoters. To test this hypothesis, we have identified novel pRb binding sites within the human genome using an unbiased approach which relies upon a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and CpG microarray analysis. To provide the greatest opportunity of finding distinct sets of pRb binding sites, we examined pRb binding in chromatin obtained from human Raji cells synchronized in either G0/G1 phase or S phase. These experiments have allowed us to identify a large set of new genomic binding sites for the pRb protein. We found that some sites are occupied by pRb only during G0/G1 phase, as would be predicted from previous models of pRb function. We also identified sites to which pRb bound only during S phase and other sites which were bound constitutively by pRb. Surprisingly, we found that E2F1 was present at most of the CpG islands bound by pRb, independent of the phase of the cell cycle. Thus, although pRb has the potential to interact with numerous transcription factors, our data suggest that the majority of DNA-bound pRb is recruited to E2F target promoters during both G0/G1 and S phases."
https://openalex.org/W2059078585,"Werner's syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive disorder, characterized at the cellular level by genomic instability in the form of variegated translocation mosaicism and extensive deletions. Individuals with WS prematurely develop multiple age-related pathologies and exhibit increased incidence of cancer. WRN, the gene defective in WS, encodes a 160-kDa protein (WRN), which has 3'-5'exonuclease, DNA helicase and DNA-dependent ATPase activities. WRN-defective cells are hypersensitive to certain genotoxic agents that cause replication arrest and/or double-strand breaks at the replication fork, suggesting a pivotal role for WRN in the protection of the integrity of the genoma during the DNA replication process. Here, we show that WRN is phosphorylated through an ATR/ATM dependent pathway in response to replication blockage. However, we provide evidence that WRN phosphorylation is not essential for its subnuclear relocalization after replication arrest. Finally, we show that WRN and ATR colocalize after replication fork arrest, suggesting that WRN and the ATR kinase collaborate to prevent genome instability during the S phase."

https://openalex.org/W1971996726,"Cytoskeletal proteins are key participants in the cellular progression to apoptosis. Our previous work demonstrated the critical dependence of actomyosin rearrangement and MLC phosphorylation in TNF-alpha-induced endothelial cell apoptosis. As these events reflect the activation of the multifunctional endothelial cell (EC) MLCK isoform, we assessed the direct role of EC MLCK in the regulation of TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. Bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells expressing either an adenovirus encoding antisense MLCK cDNA (Ad.GFP-AS MLCK) or a dominant/negative EC MLCK construct (EC MLCK-ATPdel) resulted in marked reductions in MLCK activity and TNF-alpha-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, a constitutively active EC MLCK lacking the carboxyl-terminal autoinhibitory domains (EC MLCK-1745) markedly enhanced the apoptotic response to TNF-alpha. Immunostaining in GFP-EC MLCK-expressing cells revealed colocalization of caspase 8 and EC MLCK along actin stress fibers after TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha induced the caspase-dependent cleavage of EC MLCK-1745 in transfected endothelial cells, which was confirmed by mass spectroscopy with in vitro cleavage by caspase 3 at LKKD (D1703). The resulting MLCK fragments displayed significant calmodulin-independent kinase activity. These studies convincingly demonstrate that novel interactions between the apoptotic machinery and EC MLCK exist that regulate the endothelial contractile apparatus in TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2169268148,"Decorin is a well-known, ubiquitous proteoglycan that is a normal component of the ECM. Upon transgenic expression of decorin, tumor cells with diverse histogenetic background overexpress p21WAF1, a potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase activity, become arrested in G1, and fail to generate tumors in immunocompromised animals. Because decorin is a secreted protein, it has been recently suggested that decorin could act as an autocrine and paracrine regulator of tumor growth. Here, we demonstrate that adenovirus (Ad)-mediated transfer and expression of human decorin cDNA induced in vivo apoptosis of xenograft tumor cells in nude mice. This oncolytic activity was observed when the Ad vector encoding the decorin cDNA was injected intratumorally (i.t.) or i.v. Importantly, i.t. injection of the decorin Ad vector led to growth inhibition of the injected tumor associated with similar growth inhibition of a distant contralateral tumor, demonstrating a distant decorin antitumoral effect. Immunochemistry against human decorin and decorin quantitation in tumors confirmed that decorin migrated to the tumor distant site. Furthermore, decorin effect was specific to tumor cells, because neither apoptosis nor growth inhibition were observed in nontumoral human cells such as hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts, despite p21 overexpression."
https://openalex.org/W1984595430,"The importance of mitochondrial activity has recently been extended to the regulation of developmental processes. Numerous pathologies associated with organelle's dysfunctions emphasize their physiological importance. However, regulation of mitochondrial genome transcription, a key element for organelle's function, remains poorly understood. After characterization in the organelle of a truncated form of the triiodothyronine nuclear receptor (p43), a T3-dependent transcription factor of the mitochondrial genome, our purpose was to search for other mitochondrial receptors involved in the regulation of organelle transcription. We show that a 44 kDa protein related to RXRalpha (mt-RXR), another nuclear receptor, is located in the mitochondrial matrix. We found that mt-RXR is produced after cytosolic or intramitochondrial enzymatic cleavage of the RXRalpha nuclear receptor. After mitochondrial import and binding to specific sequences of the organelle genome, mt-RXR induces a ligand-dependent increase in mitochondrial RNA levels. mt-RXR physically interacts with p43 and acts alone or through a heterodimerical complex activated by 9-cis-retinoic acid and T3 to increase RNA levels. These data indicate that hormonal regulation of mitochondrial transcription occurs through pathways similar to those that take place in the nucleus and open a new way to better understand hormone and vitamin action at the cellular level."
https://openalex.org/W1963583989,"Observing cells in their original niche is a key link between the information gleaned from planar culture and in vivo physiology and pathology. A new approach combining the transparency of the cornea, Hoffman modulation optics, and digital imaging allowed movements of individual corneal cells to be viewed directly in situ. 3-Dimensional time-lapse movies imaging unstained cells within the stratified corneal epithelium during wound healing were made. Tracking cell movements dynamically provided a definitive answer to the long-standing question: does a stratified epithelium heal by ""sliding"" of cell sheets as a coherent unit or do individual cells ""leap frog"" each other at the wound margin? A wound in the corneal epithelium healed primarily by sliding of the whole epithelium, with approximately 95% of cells moving with similar speed and trajectories and with little change in their relative position. Only 5% of cells changed layers, with equal proportions moving up or down. Epithelial healing in situ occurred in three phases: a latency, migration, and reconstruction phase. This model provides a unique system to study the behaviors of individual cells in their original niche. It shows that cells slide into a wound as a unified unit to heal a stratified epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2017103519,"In S. cerevisiae cells undergoing anaphase, a ras-related GTPase, Tem1, is located on the spindle pole body that enters the daughter cell and activates a signal transduction pathway, MEN, to allow mitotic exit. MEN activation must be reversed after mitotic exit to reset the cell cycle in G1. We find that daughter cells activate an Antagonist of MEN pathway (AMEN) in part through induction of the Amn1 protein that binds directly to Tem1 and prevents its association with its target kinase Cdc15. Failure of Amn1 function results in defects of both the spindle assembly and nuclear orientation checkpoints and delays turning off Cdc14 in G1. Thus, Amn1 is part of a daughter-specific switch that helps cells exit from mitotic exit and reset the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2036411319,"Increased reduction of glucose via the polyol pathway enzyme aldose reductase (AR) has been linked to the development of secondary diabetic complications. Because AR is a redox-sensitive protein, which in vitro is readily modified by NO donors, we tested the hypothesis that NO may be a physiological regulator of AR. We found that administration of the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) increased sorbitol accumulation in the aorta of nondiabetic and diabetic rats, whereas treatment with L-arginine (a precursor of NO) or nitroglycerine patches prevented sorbitol accumulation. When incubated ex vivo with high glucose, sorbitol accumulation was increased by L-NAME and prevented by L-arginine in strips of aorta from rats or wild-type, but not eNOS-deficient, mice. Exposure to NO donors also inhibited AR and prevented sorbitol accumulation in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in culture. The NO donors also increased the incorporation of radioactivity in the AR protein immunoprecipitated from VSMC in which the glutathione pool was prelabeled with [35S]-cysteine. Based on these observations, we suggest that NO regulates the vascular synthesis of polyols by S-thiolating AR; therefore, increasing NO synthesis or bioavailability may be useful in preventing diabetes-induced changes in the polyol pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1967822571,"p53 is the most frequently altered gene in human cancer and therefore represents an ideal target for cancer therapy. Several amino terminal p53-derived synthetic peptides were tested for their antiproliferative effects on breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-468 (mutant p53), MCF-7 (overexpressed wild-type p53), and MDA-MB-157 (null p53). p53(15)Ant peptide representing the majority of the mouse double minute clone 2 binding site on p53 (amino acids 12-26) fused to the Drosophila carrier protein Antennapedia was the most effective. p53(15)Ant peptide induced rapid, nonapoptotic cell death resembling necrosis in all breast cancer cells; however, minimal cytotoxicity was observed in the nonmalignant breast epithelial cells MCF-10-2A and MCF-10F. Bioinformatic/biophysical analysis utilizing hydrophobic moment and secondary structure predictions as well as circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed an alpha-helical hydrophobic peptide structure with membrane disruptive potential. Based on these findings, p53(15)Ant peptide may be a novel peptide cancer therapeutic because it induces necrotic cell death and not apoptosis, which is uncommon in traditional cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2149086925,"We have evaluated the role of the ADP-ribosyl cyclase, CD38, in bone remodeling, a process by which the skeleton is being renewed constantly through the coordinated activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. CD38 catalyzes the cyclization of its substrate, NAD+, to the Ca2+-releasing second messenger, cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPr). We have shown previously that CD38 is expressed both in osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Its activation in the osteoclast triggers Ca2+ release through ryanodine receptors (RyRs), stimulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6), and an inhibition of bone resorption. Here, we have examined the consequences of deleting the CD38 gene in mice on skeletal remodeling. We report that CD38-/- mice displayed a markedly reduced bone mineral density (BMD) at the femur, tibia, and lumbar spine at 3 months and at the lumbar spine at 4 months, with full normalization of the BMD at all sites at 5 months. The osteoporosis at 3 months was accompanied by a reduction in primary spongiosa and increased osteoclast surfaces on histomorphometric analysis. Hematopoetic stem cells isolated ex vivo from CD38-/- mice showed a dramatic approximately fourfold increase in osteoclast formation in response to incubation for 6 days with RANK-L and M-CSF. The osteoclasts so formed in these cultures showed a approximately 2.5-fold increase in resorptive activity compared with wild-type cells. However, when adherent bone marrow stromal cells were allowed to mature into alkaline phosphatase-positive colony-forming units (CFU-Fs), those derived from CD38-/- mice showed a significant reduction in differentiation compared with wild-type cells. Real-time RT-PCR on mRNA isolated from osteoclasts at day 6 showed a significant reduction in IL-6 and IL-6 receptor mRNA, together with significant decreases in the expression of all calcineurin A isoforms, alpha, beta, and gamma. These findings establish a critical role for CD38 in osteoclast formation and bone resorption. We speculate that CD38 functions as a cellular NAD+ ""sensor,"" particularly during periods of active motility and secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2071268206,"c-fos gene is expressed constitutively in a number of tissues as well as in certain tumor cells and is inducible, in general rapidly and transiently, in virtually all other cell types by a variety of stimuli. Its protein product, c-Fos, is a short-lived transcription factor that heterodimerizes with various protein partners within the AP-1 transcription complex via leucine zipper/leucine zipper interactions for binding to specific DNA sequences. It is mostly, if not exclusively, degraded by the proteasome. To localize the determinant(s) responsible for its instability, we have conducted a genetic analysis in which the half-lives of c-Fos mutants and chimeras made with the stable EGFP reporter protein were compared under two experimental conditions taken as example of continous and inducible expression. Those were constitutive expression in asynchronously growing Balb/C 3T3 mouse embryo fibroblasts and transient induction in the same cells undergoing the G0/G1 phase transition upon stimulation by serum. Our work shows that c-Fos is degraded faster in synchronous- than in asynchronous cells. This difference in turnover is primarily accounted for by several mechanisms. First, in asynchronous cells, a unique C-terminal destabilizer is active whereas, in serum-stimulated cells two destabilizers located at both extremities of the protein are functional. Second, heterodimerization and/or binding to DNA accelerates protein degradation only during the G0/G1 phase transition. Adding another level of complexity to turnover control, phosphorylation at serines 362 and 374, which are c-Fos phosphorylation sites largely modified during the G0/G1 phase transition, stabilizes c-Fos much more efficiently in asynchronous than in serum-stimulated cells. In both cases, the reduced degradation rate is due to inhibition of the activity of the C-terminal destabilizer. However, in serum-stimulated cells, this effect is partially masked by the activation of the N-terminal destabilizer and basic domain/leucine zipper-dependent mechanisms. Taken together, our data show that multiple degradation mechanisms, differing according to the conditions of expression, may operate on c-Fos to ensure a proper level and/or timing of expression. Moreover, they also indicate that the half-life of c-Fos during the G0/G1 phase transition is determined by a delicate balance between opposing stabilizing and destabilizing mechanisms operating at the same time."

https://openalex.org/W2012007314,"The role of Galpha(i)-2 overexpression in desensitization of beta-adrenergic signaling in heart failure is controversial. An adenovirus-based approach was used to investigate whether overexpression of Galpha(i)-2 impairs beta-adrenergic stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity and cAMP levels in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (NRCM) and cell shortening of adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM). Infection of NRCM with Ad5Galpha(i)-2 increased Galpha(i)-2 by 50-600% in a virus dose-dependent manner. Overexpression was paralleled by suppression of GTP- and isoprenaline-stimulated AC by 10-72% (P<0.001) in a PTX-sensitive manner. Isoprenaline-stimulated shortening of Ad5Galpha(i)-2-infected ARVM was attenuated by 34% (P<0.01). Ad5Galpha(i)-2/GFP (Galpha(i)-2, green fluorescent protein; bicistronic) was constructed to monitor transfection homogeneity and target Galpha(i)-2 overexpression to levels found in heart failure. At Galpha(i)-2 levels of 93% above control, isoprenaline-stimulated AC activity and cAMP levels were reduced by 17% and 40% (P<0.02), respectively. Beta1- and beta2-adrenergic stimulation was reduced similarly. Our results suggest that (a) the Galpha(i)-2 system exhibits tonic inhibition of stimulated AC in cardiac myocytes, (b) Galpha(i)-2-mediated inhibition is concentration-dependent and occurs at Galpha(i)-2 levels seen in heart failure, and (c) Galpha(i)-2-mediated inhibition affects both beta1- and beta2-adrenergic stimulation of AC. The data argue for an important, independent role of the Galpha(i)-2 increase in heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2096478492,"Microarray profiles of bulk tumor tissues reflect gene expression corresponding to malignant cells as well as to many different types of contaminating normal cells. In this report, we assess the feasibility of querying baseline multitissue transcriptome databases to dissect disease-specific genes. Using colon cancer as a model tumor, we show that the application of Boolean operators (AND, OR, BUTNOT) for database searches leads to genes with expression patterns of interest. The BUTNOT operator for example allows the assignment of ""expression signatures"" to normal tissue specimens. These expression signatures were then used to computationally identify contaminating cells within conventionally dissected tissue specimens. The combination of several logic operators together with an expression database based on multiple human tissue specimens can resolve the problem of tissue contamination, revealing novel cancer-specific gene expression. Several markers, previously not known to be colon cancer associated, are provided."

https://openalex.org/W2092560128,"Oligonucleotide microarray analysis was applied to assess the expression profile of 332 probe sets representing 308 genes or expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that map to chromosome 17 in order to address epigenetic events that result in alterations in gene expression in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Expression profiles were generated from 12 primary cultures derived from normal ovarian surface epithelium (NOSE) and four long-term cultures (TOV-81D, TOV-112D, TOV-21G and OV-90) derived from EOCs that have been previously characterized and shown to mimic features of the tumoral cells from which they were derived. The expression values of all 332 probe sets is highly correlated across the 12 NOSEs (89% correlation coefficients >0.90). In two-way comparisons, differential patterns of gene expression were observed for 157 probe sets for which the expression value of at least one EOC cell line fell outside the limits of the range of expression of the 12 NOSEs. When compared to NOSEs, four genes displayed similar differential patterns of gene expression across all four EOC cell lines, and 26 genes displayed similar differential patterns of gene expression across the three EOC cell lines (TOV-112D, TOV-21G and OV-90) representing tumoral cells derived from the most aggressive disease. A total of 17 genes displayed differential patterns of gene expression greater than threefold in at least one EOC cell line in comparison to NOSE, and three genes were differentially expressed greater than threefold across all aggressive cell lines. The analysis of a selected number of genes by RT-PCR revealed patterns of gene expression comparable to those observed by microarray analysis in the majority of samples tested. Comparison of expression profiles of differentially expressed genes identified by microarray analysis in two-way comparisons of the EOC cell lines and the NOSEs with published reports revealed 10 genes previously implicated in ovarian tumorigenesis and 18 in tumorigenesis of other types of cancer. The differential pattern of gene expression of genes that map to both the p and q arm of chromosome 17 is consistent with the hypothesis that a number of genes that map to this chromosome are implicated in the etiology of ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1995902015,"Endothelial cells exhibit an autonomous proliferative response to hypoxia, independent of paracrine effectors. In cultured endothelial cells of porcine aorta, we analyzed the signaling and compared hypoxia with mitochondrial inhibition by rotenone. Particularly, roles of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK)/MAPK pathway and cytosolic Ca2+ were studied. Hypoxia resulted in increased proliferation by 65+/-2%. Hypoxia induced transient activation of p42 MAPK (phosphorylation rose from 11+/-5 to 51+/-7%), followed by translocation of p42 MAPK into the nucleus. The proliferative response was diminished after inhibition of the MEK/MAPK pathway by PD 98059 (20 microM) or UO 126 (10 microM) but not sensitive to 8-phenyl-theophillin (10 microM), an adenosine receptor blocker, nor to a neutralizing antibody for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ release, capacitive Ca2+ influx, or removal of extracellular Ca2+ prevented hypoxic Ca2+ overload and the proliferative response. Suppression of cytosolic Ca2+ rise did not interfere with activation of p42 MAPK but abolished its nuclear translocation. Effects of hypoxia were mimicked by rotenone (10 microM. Transient hypoxic inhibition of mitochondria induces a proliferative endothelial response mediated through Ca2+-independent activation and Ca2+-dependent nuclear translocation of p42 MAPK. This proliferative response is independent of adenosine or VEGF."
