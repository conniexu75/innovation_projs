https://openalex.org/W2142888744,"An fMRI experiment was performed to identify the main stages of melody processing in the auditory pathway. Spectrally matched sounds that produce no pitch, fixed pitch, or melody were all found to activate Heschl's gyrus (HG) and planum temporale (PT). Within this region, sounds with pitch produced more activation than those without pitch only in the lateral half of HG. When the pitch was varied to produce a melody, there was activation in regions beyond HG and PT, specifically in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and planum polare (PP). The results support the view that there is hierarchy of pitch processing in which the center of activity moves anterolaterally away from primary auditory cortex as the processing of melodic sounds proceeds."
https://openalex.org/W2038220177,"Two components of cortical circuits could mediate contour integration in primary visual cortex (V1): intrinsic horizontal connections and feedback from higher cortical areas. To distinguish between these, we combined functional mapping with a new technique for labeling axons, a recombinant adenovirus bearing the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP), to determine the extent, density, and orientation specificity of V1 intrinsic connections and V2 to V1 feedback. Both connections cover portions of V1 representing regions of visual space up to eight times larger than receptive fields as classically defined, though the intrinsic connections are an order of magnitude denser than the feedback. Whereas the intrinsic connections link similarly oriented domains in V1, V2 to V1 feedback displays no such specificity. These findings suggest that V1 intrinsic horizontal connections provide a more likely substrate for contour integration."

(1999) J. Biol. Chem.274, 26071–26078), but the mechanism by which HO-1 inducers regulate Nrf2 function is not known. Treatment of mouse hepatoma (Hepa) cells with 50 μm CdCl2 increased the amount of Nrf2 protein in a time-dependent manner; induction was observed within 30 min, prior to the accumulation of HO-1 mRNA. Cadmium did not significantly affect the steady-state level of Nrf2 mRNA or the initial rate of Nrf2 protein synthesis but increased the half-life of Nrf2 from ∼13 to 100 min. Proteasome inhibitors, but not other protease inhibitors, enhanced the expression of Nrf2, and ubiquitinylated Nrf2 was detected after proteasome inhibition. Cycloheximide inhibited cadmium-stimulated Nrf2 expression and DNA binding activity and attenuated HO-1 mRNA accumulation. Conversely, proteasome inhibitors enhanced HO-1 mRNA and protein accumulation by a Nrf2-dependent mechanism. Together, these results indicate that Nrf2 is targeted for rapid degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and that cadmium delays the rate of Nrf2 degradation leading to ho-1 gene activation.

Cells utilize both exogenous (e.g. vitamins and plant-derived phenolic antioxidants) and endogenous (e.g.catalase and superoxide dismutase) mechanisms to detoxify ROS. A continuing imbalance between ROS production and ROS detoxification, however, results in cellular oxidative stress. In an effort to maintain cellular homeostasis, cells respond to this imbalance in part by modulating the expression of a select set of genes that encode proteins with antioxidant and cytoprotective activities. Central to this response are the transcription factors that control the activation of these stress-responsive genes. Examples of such stress-responsive transcription factors include the well-characterized heat shock factors (1Morano K.A. Thiele D.J. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 271-282PubMed Google Scholar) and members of the AP-1 (2Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar, 3Karin M.

Recent studies from several laboratories have identified another potentially important stress-responsive transcription factor, Nrf2. Like the AP-1 constituents, Fos and Jun factors, Nrf2 is a basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) protein that functions as an obligate dimer (4Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and ATF4 (8He C.H. Gong P., Hu, B. Stewart D. Choi M.E. Choi A.M. Alam J. J. Biol.

Such dimers bind tocis-elements with similar core sequences and are alternatively known as MAREs (Maf recognition elements) (9Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1996; 15: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Multiple Nrf2 target genes, almost all of which are inducible by various oxidants, electrophiles, or xenobiotics, have been identified: among others these include genes that encode phase II detoxification enzymes (12Venugopal R.

Individually and collectively, the select set of Nrf2-regulated proteins function to detoxify xenobiotics, reduce oxidized proteins, maintain cellular reducing equivalents, disrupt redox cycling reactions, and inhibit the generation of, or counteract the effects of, ROS. Given these activities of the target gene products, Nrf2 appears to be a key physiological regulator of the cellular adaptive response to oxidants and xenobiotics. Consistent with this idea, Nrf2-deficient mice are more prone to butylated hydroxytoluene-mediated pulmonary dysfunction (20Chan K. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12731-12736Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), are susceptible to acetaminophen hepatotoxicity (21Chan K. Han X.D. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moreover, macrophages derived from such mice exhibit reduced resistance to toxic electrophiles (24Ishii T. Itoh K. Takahashi S. Sato H. Yanagawa T. Katoh Y. Bannai S. Yamamoto M. J. Biol.

Although much is known about the regulation of Nrf2 target genes, the mechanisms by which xenobiotics and oxidants regulate Nrf2 activity are not well characterized and are under active investigation. Accumulating evidence (25Kobayashi M. Itoh K. Suzuki T. Osanai H. Nishikawa K. Katoh Y. Takagi Y. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 26Itoh K.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) suggests that such activity is regulated at least in part at the level of sub-cellular compartmentalization. According to this model, under normal conditions, Nrf2 exists in an inactive, cytoplasm-localized state, in part or fully as a consequence of binding to the cytoskeleton-associated protein Keap1 (25Kobayashi M.

Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2768) Google Scholar). Upon cellular stimulation by stress agents, the cytoplasmic retention mechanism is inactivated, and Nrf2 is transported to the nucleus by one or more as yet uncharacterized mechanisms but one that, under certain circumstances, may involve protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of Nrf2 (16Huang H.C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, Nrf2 heterodimers bind to response elements to regulate target gene transcription. Another control point may be at the level of DNA binding. Jaiswal and colleagues (7Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 31Jeyapaul J. Jaiswal A.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1433-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) have shown that the association and DNA-binding activity of Nrf2·Jun dimers requires a cytosolic factor yet to be characterized. Whether such a factor is responsive to oxidative stress and how it regulates an ultimately nuclear activity are not known. Xenobiotics may also promote Nrf2 activity by stimulating nrf2 gene transcription. Kwak et al. (32Kwak M.K. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2883-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) have recently described a positive feedback mechanism in which Nrf2 autoregulates its own expression in response to 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione via an ARE-like sequence within the nrf2 gene. In this report, we describe a different mechanism of Nrf2 regulation. We show that Nrf2 is a highly labile protein, rapidly and specifically degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and that cadmium stimulates Nrf2 activity and subsequent activation of the ho-1 target gene at least in part by stabilization of the Nrf2 protein. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by IDT, Inc., and radiochemicals were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Antibodies against transcription factors (Nrf1, Nrf2, E2F1, JunD, and ATF2) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Inc., whereas anti-rat HO-1 was acquired from StressGen Biotech. Corp. Protease inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem. Reagents for luciferase assays were acquired from Sigma Chemical Co. All other chemicals were of reagent grade. Mouse hepatoma (Hepa) cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.45% glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum (Mediatech), and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Cells were routinely passaged every 3–4 days. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were typically seeded (4 × 106 cells/100-mm plate or 1 × 106 cells/60-mm plate) and cultured for 40–48 h in complete medium prior to treatment with agents in serum-free medium. Total RNA was isolated by the procedure of Chomczynski and Sacchi (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar), and Northern or dot blot analyses were carried out as previously described (34Alam J. Shibahara S. Smith A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6371-6375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Alam J. Wicks C. Stewart D. Gong P. Touchard C. Otterbein S. Choi A.M. Burow M.E. Tou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27694-27702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses were carried out using either whole cell protein extracts or nuclear extracts (36Gong P., Hu, B. Stewart D. Ellerbe M. Figueroa Y.G. Blank V. Beckman B.S. Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27018-27025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For detection of Nrf2, extracts were electrophoresed on a 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE gel (Invitrogen), and proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked overnight in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk and then incubated with the primary antibody (1:1000 dilution) for 3 h. Treatment with the secondary antibody and antigen detection were carried out using the ECL system (AmershamBiosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Detection of HO-1, ATF2, JunD, and MafG was carried out as previously described (8He C.H. Gong P., Hu, B. Stewart D. Choi M.E. Choi A.M. Alam J. J. Biol.

Hepa cells were plated (5 × 105 cells/35-mm plate) and cultured until ∼80% confluent. Cells were washed (2×) with pulse labeling media (methionine-free, Hepes-buffered (pH 7.5) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The media was removed and replaced with pulse labeling media containing 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine and the appropriate inducing agent. After labeling for appropriate time periods, the media was removed and the cells were washed (2×) with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by the addition of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 400 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS) containing 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm PMSF. Samples were collected by scraping, transferred to Eppendorf tubes, and sonicated (3× for 30 s each). Lysates were collected after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For pulse-chase experiments, labeling was carried out for 30 min and terminated by direct addition of cold methionine (20-fold molar excess) to the culture media. Cells were incubated for varying time periods prior to lysis. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were pre-cleared using 1 μg of pre-immune rabbit IgG and 20 μl of a 50% slurry of Sepharose-coupled Protein A. Pre-cleared lysates containing equivalent amounts of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts (∼150 μg of protein) were incubated with 1 μg of anti-Nrf2 IgG at 4 °C with continuous rotation. After 18 h, a 20-μl slurry of Protein A-Sepharose was added, and incubation was continued for an additional 2 h. Immunocomplexes were pelleted by centrifugation, washed in RIPA buffer (4×), and resuspended in 40 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol and 0.1 mmPMSF. The samples were heated at 100 °C for 4 min, and 15-μl aliquots were subjected to electrophoresis. Signals were detected and quantified using a phosphorimaging device (Packard Instruments). Ubiquitinylation of Nrf2 and E2F1 was carried out by modification of the procedure of Treieret al. (37Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Human embryo kidney (HEK) 293 cells (1 × 106 cells/60-mm plate) were transfected with DNA mixtures consisting of the following: empty vector or plasmids encoding Nrf2 or E2F1 (500 ng), empty vector or plasmid encoding His-tagged ubiquitin (500 ng), and a luciferase expression plasmid (25 ng) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with 10 μmMG-132 for 3 h and collected in phosphate-buffered saline. A portion (1/20) of the cells was lysed and assayed for luciferase activity (38Alam J. Maines M.D. Costa L.G. Reed D.J. Sassa S. Sipes I.G.

The remainder of the cells was lysed in lysis binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.5 m NaCl, 8m urea) containing 5 mm imidazole, and luciferase-equivalent portions were adsorbed onto Ni+2-charged agarose (25-μl packed volume). The resin was washed (3×) with lysis binding buffer containing 5 mmimidazole and then (3×) with lysis binding buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. Proteins were eluted within 30 μl of elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 0.5 mNaCl, 8 m urea, and 200 mm imidazole) and subjected to electrophoresis and Western blot analysis as described above. Cells were treated with vehicle or 25 μm CdCl2 in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml cycloheximide in serum-free medium for 3 h and then collected for preparation of whole cell extracts (36Gong P., Hu, B.

A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the sequence 5′-TTTTATGCTGTGTCATGGTT-3′ (core StRE sequence is underlined) was used as probe in EMSA reactions using conditions previously reported (36Gong P., Hu, B.

In antibody supershift assays, 2 μg of pre-immune IgG or anti-transcription factor IgG was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 20 min at room temperature prior to electrophoresis. The construction of pE1-luc and pE1M789-luc has been described previously (35Alam J. Wicks C. Stewart D. Gong P. Touchard C. Otterbein S. Choi A.M. Burow M.E. Tou J. J. Biol.

Transient transfections of Hepa cells, preparation of cell extract, and measurement of reporter enzyme activities were carried out as previously reported (38Alam J. Maines M.D. Costa L.G. Reed D.J.

We have previously demonstrated the requirement for Nrf2 in cadmium-dependent ho-1 gene activation in several cell types, including Hepa cells (18Alam J. Stewart D. Touchard C. Boinapally S.

Burow M.E. Tou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27694-27702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Consistent with this role, here we demonstrate that cadmium also regulates Nrf2 expression. Treatment of Hepa cells with 50 μmCdCl2 increased the steady-state level of Nrf2 in a time-dependent manner to greater than 20-fold above basal values (Fig. 1). In our gel system, mouse Nrf2 migrates as an 88-kDa protein, significantly larger than the predicted size of 66 kDa. Accumulation of Nrf2 was detected within 30 min after cell treatment, well before the observable increase in HO-1 mRNA (typically between 1 and 2 h after exposure to CdCl2) (Ref. 34Alam J. Shibahara S. Smith A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6371-6375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 2) or HO-1 protein (2 h) (Fig. 1). The induction of Nrf2 protein by cadmium is a specific response, because the expression of ATF2 and of other transcription factors such as JunD and CREB (8He C.H. Gong P., Hu, B. Stewart D. Choi M.E. Choi A.M. Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20858-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) is not affected by this agent.Figure 2Cadmium stimulates accumulation of HO-1 mRNA but not of Nrf2 RNA. Hepa cells were exposed to 50 μm CdCl2 for the indicated time and collected for RNA isolation. Total RNA (10 μg/lane) was electrophoresed, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized to the indicated cDNA probes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In stark contrast to the effect on Nrf2 protein expression, exposure of Hepa cells to 50 m cadmium (for up to 6 h) did not significantly alter the steady-state level of Nrf2 mRNA (Fig. 2). As expected, cadmium treatment dramatically increased the level of HO-1 mRNA in a time-dependent manner. The level of ribosomal protein S3 mRNA, which was used as a control for RNA loading, was not significantly changed during the course of this treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that cadmium regulates Nrf2 expression primarily by one or more post-transcriptional mechanisms. Cadmium may increase the level of Nrf2 by regulating one or both of two general processes: the rate of Nrf2 synthesis or the rate of Nrf2 degradation. The rate of Nrf2 synthesis was monitored by pulse-labeling analysis, and typical results are shown in Fig. 3. [35S]Methionine-labeled Nrf2 steadily accumulated over a period of 15 min in unstimulated cells, and the rate of accumulation was not affected by cadmium (left panel). The apparent stimulation of Nrf2 synthesis by cadmium was first detected after 20 min of labeling and was more pronounced (∼2.5-fold over control) after 30 and 60 min (right panel). To examine the role of protein stabilization in Nrf2 regulation by cadmium, we monitored the decay of basal and cadmium-induced Nrf2 protein in Hepa cells after inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide. In the experiment depicted in Fig. 1, whole cell extracts were used to monitor both Nrf2 and the endoplasmic reticulum-localized HO-1 in the same sample. Subsequent studies using cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions demonstrated that basal and induced Nrf2 are localized exclusively in the nucleus, because the level of cytoplasmic Nrf2 is below the detection limit of the Western blot assay (data not shown). Consequently, in the following experiment, nuclear extracts were used to obtain a stronger Nrf2 signal in unstimulated cells. Nrf2 in the nuclei of untreated cells decayed rapidly after addition of cycloheximide and could not be detected after 40 min even after longer exposure of the membrane to the phosphorimaging screen (Fig. 4 A). In unstimulated Hepa cells, the half-life of Nrf2 was calculated to be ∼13 min. Cadmium-induced Nrf2, however, was more stable with an estimatedt 12 of nearly 100 min. The specificity of this response was demonstrated by the fact that cadmium did not appreciably affect the steady-state level or the rate of degradation of transcription factor JunD (Fig. 4 B). Similar results were obtained by pulse-chase analysis (data not shown but see below). We interpret these results to indicate that cadmium stimulates Nrf2 expression primarily by attenuating the rate of Nrf2 degradation. Although we cannot completely exclude an effect on Nrf2 synthesis, it is likely that the apparent increase in the synthetic rate observed at the later time points (30 to 60 min) is a consequence of protein stabilization. Many labile regulatory proteins, including signal-activated transcription factors, are commonly degraded by the 26 S proteasome, a highly conserved, multiprotein proteolytic system (40Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6879) Google Scholar). If Nrf2 is degraded by this pathway, then inhibition of the proteasome should result in higher levels of Nrf2. As shown in Fig. 5 A, with treatment of Hepa cells with MG-132 (10 μm), lactacystin (20 μm), and PI 1 (20 μm), all selective inhibitors of the 26 S proteasome significantly increased the steady-state level of Nrf2. The most potent response was observed with MG-132; lactacystin and PI 1 were less effective, but unlike MG-132, further stimulated Nrf2 expression in the presence of 25 μm CdCl2. Inhibitors of serine proteases (PMSF), calpain (PD150606), serine/cysteine proteases (leupeptin), and lysozomal proteases (chloroquine) were ineffective (Fig. 5 A and data not shown). Control experiments showed that none of the protease inhibitors stimulate expression of α-tubulin (Fig. 5 A). The proteasome inhibitors did not affect the steady-state level of Nrf2 mRNA (data not shown). To directly demonstrate that induction of Nrf2 by the proteasome inhibitors results from inhibition of protein degradation, Nrf2 stability was assayed by pulse-chase experiments. Under normal conditions, [35S]methionine-labeled Nrf2 was rapidly degraded and barely detected 30 min after termination of labeling (Fig. 5 B, “−”). In the presence of MG-132, labeled Nrf2 was maintained at constant levels up to the last time point tested. Taken together, these results indicate that Nrf2 is specifically degraded by the 26 S proteasome. Most, but not all, proteins selectively degraded by the 26 S proteasome are marked by prior, covalent ligation of ubiquitin molecules, a highly conserved ∼8-kDa polypeptide, to the ε-amino group of lysine residues. The ubiquitin-conjugating system usually generates substrate proteins containing varying lengths of polyubiquitin chains resulting from linkage of successive ubiquitin molecules to the previous moiety (40Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6879) Google Scholar). Identification of ubiquitinylated Nrf2 would suggest that this transcription factor is regulated via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Because they are rapidly degraded by the proteasome, endogenous ubiquitinylated species of a specific protein are generally difficult to detect (37Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 41Sutter C.H. Laughner E. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4748-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). We, therefore, employed the strategy of Treieret al. (37Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), which involves cellular co- and overexpression of the target protein (e.g. Nrf2) and poly-His-tagged ubiquitin. His-tagged ubiquitin-conjugated proteins are subsequently purified and concentrated by affinity chromatography, and the ubiquitinylated target protein is detected immunologically. In a necessary modification, transfected cells were treated with MG-132 to inhibit proteasome activity prior to isolation of ubiquitinylated proteins. Transcription factor E2F1 was used as a positive control for this experiment, because it is known to be ubiquitinylated (42Campanero M.R. Flemington E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2221-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, a ladder of mono- and polyubiquitinylated Nrf2 was read"

Here we show that AP2, a clathrin adaptor complex important for endocytosis, associates with a region of GluR2 that overlaps the NSF binding site. Peptides used previously to interfere with NSF binding also antagonize GluR2-AP2 interaction. Using GluR2 mutants and peptide variants that dissociate NSF and AP2 interaction, we find that AP2 is involved specifically in NMDA receptor-induced (but not ligand-dependent) internalization of AMPA receptors, and is essential for hippocampal long-term depression (LTD). NSF function, on the other hand, is needed to maintain synaptic AMPA receptor responses, but is not directly required for NMDA receptor-mediated internalization and LTD."

Reporter expression indicated that connexin36 was present in multiple retinal neurons including rod photoreceptors, cone bipolar cells, and AII amacrine cells. Disruption of electrical synapses between adjacent AIIs and between AIIs and ON cone bipolars was demonstrated by intracellular injection of Neurobiotin. In addition, extracellular recording in the knockout revealed the complete elimination of rod-mediated, on-center responses at the ganglion cell level. These data represent direct proof that electrical synapses are critical for the propagation of rod signals across the mammalian retina, and they demonstrate the existence of multiple rod pathways, each of which is dependent on electrical synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1976438877,"Activity-dependent and -independent signals collaborate to regulate synaptogenesis, but their relative contributions are unclear. Here, we describe the formation of neuromuscular synapses at which neurotransmission is completely and specifically blocked by mutation of the neurotransmitter-synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase. Nerve terminals differentiate extensively in the absence of neurotransmitter, but neurotransmission plays multiple roles in synaptic differentiation. These include influences on the numbers of pre- and postsynaptic partners, the distribution of synapses in the target field, the number of synaptic sites per target cell, and the number of axons per synaptic site. Neurotransmission also regulates the formation or stability of transient acetylcholine receptor-rich processes (myopodia) that may initiate nerve-muscle contact. At subsequent stages, neurotransmission delays some steps in synaptic maturation but accelerates others. Thus, neurotransmission affects synaptogenesis from early stages and coordinates rather than drives synaptic maturation."

Herein, we demonstrate UPR activation in the leukodystrophy Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) as well as in three mouse models of this disease and transfected fibroblasts expressing mutant protein. The CHOP protein, widely known as a proapoptotic transcription factor, modulates pathogenesis in the mouse models of PMD; however, this protein exhibits antiapoptotic activity. Together, these data show that the UPR has the potential to modulate disease severity in many cells expressing mutant secretory pathway proteins. Thus, PMD represents the first member of a novel class of disparate degenerative diseases for which UPR activation and signaling is the common pathogenic mechanism."

Cyclic AMP signaling pathways are important for many brain functions, such as learning and memory, drug addiction, and development. Here we show that wild-type, AC1, AC8, or AC1&8 double knockout (DKO) mice were indistinguishable in tests of acute pain, whereas behavioral responses to peripheral injection of two inflammatory stimuli, formalin and complete Freund's adjuvant, were reduced or abolished in AC1&8 DKO mice. AC1 and AC8 are highly expressed in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and contribute to inflammation-induced activation of CREB. Intra-ACC administration of forskolin rescued behavioral allodynia defective in the AC1&8 DKO mice. Our studies suggest that AC1 and AC8 in the ACC selectively contribute to behavioral allodynia."

https://openalex.org/W1997486888,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is known to promote neuronal survival, guide axonal pathfinding, and participate in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. In Xenopus nerve-muscle cultures, localized contact of a single BDNF-coated bead with the presynaptic axon resulted in potentiation of transmitter secretion at the developing synapses, but only when the bead was placed within 60 μm from the synapse. The localized potentiation induced by BDNF is accompanied by a persistent local elevation of [Ca2+]i in the axon and requires constitutive presynaptic protein translation, even for axons severed from the cell body. Thus, presynaptic local TrkB signaling and protein synthesis allow a localized source of BDNF to potentiate transmitter secretion from nearby synapses, a property suited for spatially restricted synaptic modification by neurotrophins."
https://openalex.org/W2003548070,"Mammalian neurogenesis is determined by an interplay between intrinsic genetic mechanisms and extrinsic cues such as growth factors. Here we have defined a signaling cascade, a MEK-C/EBP pathway, that is essential for cortical progenitor cells to become postmitotic neurons. Inhibition of MEK or of the C/EBP family of transcription factors inhibits neurogenesis while expression of a C/EBPβ mutant that is a phosphorylation-mimic at a MEK-Rsk site enhances neurogenesis. C/EBP mediates this positive effect by direct transcriptional activation of neuron-specific genes such as Tα1 α-tubulin. Conversely, inhibition of C/EBP-dependent transcription enhances CNTF-mediated generation of astrocytes from the same progenitor cells. Thus, activation of a MEK-C/EBP pathway enhances neurogenesis and inhibits gliogenesis, thereby providing a mechanism whereby growth factors can selectively bias progenitors to become neurons during development."
https://openalex.org/W1995217818,"MUC1 clearance from the uterine epithelial cell surface is a prerequisite for the creation of an environment conducive to embryo implantation. In some species, reduced mRNA levels along with metabolic turnover account for loss of MUC1 during the receptive phase throughout the uterine epithelium. In other species, MUC1 is rapidly lost solely at the site of blastocyst attachment, suggesting the action of a protease. Correlative studies also indicate the presence of soluble forms of MUC1 in cell culture supernatants in vitro and in bodily fluids in vivo. To characterize the proteolytic activity mediating MUC1 release, shedding of MUC1 was analyzed in a human uterine epithelial cell line (HES) that abundantly expresses and readily sheds MUC1. MUC1 release was stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and was markedly inhibited by the synthetic peptide hydroxamate metalloprotease inhibitor, tumor necrosis factor-α protease inhibitor (TAPI), as well as by an endogenous inhibitor of matrix metalloproteases, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases (TIMP)-3. These characteristics along with studies conducted with cell lines genetically deficient in various ADAMs (foradisintegrin andmetalloprotease) identified tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE)/ADAM 17 as a MUC1 sheddase. Furthermore, both TACE and MUC1 were expressed in human uterine epithelia during the receptive phase, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a physical interaction between TACE and MUC1 in HES cells. These studies establish a proteolytic mechanism for MUC1 clearance from a human uterine epithelial cell line and identify TACE as a MUC1 sheddase."

Synaptic vesicles at inhibited synapses were abundant in the cytoplasm and covered the synaptic body at high density. Continuous maximal stimulation depleted 73% of the vesicles within 800 nm of the synapse, with a concomitant increase in surface area of intracellular cisterns and plasmalemmal infoldings. Docked vesicles were depleted 60%–80% regardless of their distance from the active zone. Vesicles on the synaptic body were depleted primarily in the hemisphere facing the plasmalemma, creating a gradient of vesicles on its surface. We conclude that formation of new synaptic vesicles from cisterns is rate limiting in the vesicle cycle."

This shift was blocked by CrmA but not by BCL-2 overexpression, suggesting that it occurred through activation of procaspase-8. Geldanamycin pretreatment led to a proteasome-dependent decrease in the levels of several TNFR1-interacting proteins including the kinases receptor-interacting protein, inhibitor of κB kinase-α, inhibitor of κB kinase-β, and to a lesser extent the adaptors NF-κB essential modulator and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2.

No significant decrease in the levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases, adaptor proteins TNFR-associated death domain and Fas-associated death domain, or caspase-3, -8, and -9 could be detected. These results suggest that HSP90 client proteins play a crucial role in necrotic signaling. We conclude that inhibition of HSP90 may alter the composition of the TNFR1 complex, favoring the caspase-8-dependent apoptotic pathway. In the absence of geldanamycin, certain HSP90 client proteins may be preferentially recruited to the TNFR1 complex, promoting necrosis.

The primary paradigm of natural programmed cell death (PCD) is observed during normal embryogenesis. Schweichel and Merker (1Schweichel J.U. Merker H.J. Teratology. 1973; 7: 253-266Google Scholar, 2Fiers W. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7719-7730Google Scholar) identified three pathways of programmed cell death. The first pathway was characterized by the condensation of nucleus and cytoplasm and corresponds to apoptosis. The second pathway was characterized by abundant autophagic vacuoles and no or minimal nuclear changes (as often seen in cells dying by necrosis), whereas the third pathway was a more rare variant of necrotic cell death. Apoptosis is morphologically characterized by membrane blebbing, shrinking of the cell and its organelles, internucleosomal degradation of DNA, and disintegration of the cell after which the fragments are phagocytosed by neighboring cells (3Kerr J.F.

One of the cell lines intensively studied in our laboratory is the L929 fibrosarcoma cell line. In these cells apoptotic as well as necrotic cell death can be induced.

In L929sAhFas cells transfected with human Fas, the apoptotic cell death pathway can be induced by clustering of FAS with agonistic anti-FAS antibodies.

Neckers L. Liu Z.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10519-10526Google Scholar). They showed that disruption of HSP90 function by the addition of GA results in the degradation of RIP and blockage of TNF-induced NF-κB activation. In the present study, we analyzed whether GA-induced inhibition of HSP90 function could block TNFR1-induced necrosis in L929 fibrosarcoma cells. We show that inhibition of the function of HSP90 leads to a switch from TNFR1 necrotic cell death to apoptotic cell death. This correlates with the preferential decrease of the expression levels of several TNFR1 signaling-associated proteins, resulting in the abolishment of TNF-mediated activation of NF-κB, JNK, p38MAPK, and necrosis. Moreover, GA pretreatment does not affect the expression levels of proteins that constitute the apoptotic signaling axis, such as TRADD, FADD, and procaspase-8, and thus promotes a TNFR1-induced apoptotic response.

Recombinant hTNF was produced in Escherichia coli and purified to at least 99% homogeneity.

The caspase fluorogenic substrate acetyl-Asp(OMe)- Glu-(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-aminomethylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-amc) was obtained from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan) and used at 50 μm. Anti-murine caspase-9 antibodies and polyclonal antibodies against JNK, p38MAPK, ERK, IKK-α, and IKK-β were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA).

Anti-murine RIP antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The cells were kept in suspension by seeding 105 cells in uncoated 24-well tissue culture plates (Sarstedt Inc., Newton, NC). 1 μm GA was added 16 h before stimulation. After preincubation for 1 h with or without zVAD-fmk, human TNF (10,000 units/ml) was added to the cells for different time intervals. Cell death was analyzed for loss of membrane integrity by PI uptake. PI (30 μm) was added 10 min before measuring and was detected at 610 nm on a FACScalibur® flow fluorocytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with a 488-nm argon ion laser. DNA histograms were obtained by subjecting the samples to one freeze-thaw cycle in the presence of PI and analyzing PI fluorescence of the cells as described above. Cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline A and lysed in 150 μl of caspase lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 mmaprotinin, and 1 mm leupeptin). Equal amounts were loaded per lane on 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and after separation and blotting the different proteins were detected with the indicated antibodies and developed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). For detection of the phosphorylated forms of p38MAPK and JNK, cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% w/v bromphenol blue). The fluorogenic substrate assay for caspase activity was carried out as described previously (7Vercammen D. Brouckaert G. Denecker G. Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp.

Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and caspase activity was determined by incubating 15 μl of the soluble fraction with 50 μm Ac-DEVD-amc in 150 μl of cell-free system buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 220 mmmannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 2 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.5 mml-glutamine, and 10 mmdithiothreitol. The release of fluorescent aminomethylcoumarin was measured for 1 h at 2-min intervals by fluorometry (excitation at 360 nm and emission at 480 nm) (Cytofluor; PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA); the maximal rate of increase in fluorescence was calculated (ΔF/min). The cells were seeded in 6-well adherent plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well. 1 μm GA was added 16 h before stimulation. After preincubation for 1 h with or without 25 μmzVAD-fmk, hTNF (10,000 units/ml) was added to the cells for different time intervals. Light microscopic pictures were taken on different time points (Integrated Modulation Contrast, ×400). A previous report demonstrated that pretreatment of human Jurkat T-cell lymphoma cells with the pancaspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk shifts their response to FASL from apoptosis to necrosis. However, pretreating these cells with the combination of zVAD-fmk and the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin protects them from FAS-mediated necrosis (8Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Google Scholar). L929sA cells respond to TNF by caspase-independent necrosis even without the addition of caspase inhibitors (6Vercammen D. Beyaert R. Denecker G. Goossens V. Van Loo G. Declercq W. Grooten J. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1477-1485Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the effect of GA on TNFR1-induced necrosis in these cells. Preincubation of the cells with GA during 16 h strongly sensitized the cells to the cytotoxic effect of TNF. However, analysis of the cell morphology by light microscopy revealed that the cells did not die by necrosis but instead responded by apoptosis characterized by membrane blebbing and nuclear condensation (Fig. 1 A). The morphological assessment of apoptotic cell death after pretreatment with GA was confirmed using biochemical parameters such as (in order of appearance) caspase activation, tBid generation, cytochromec release, DNA hypoploidy, and cell membrane permeabilization (Fig. 1, B and C). None of these typically apoptosis-related events was detected in TNF-induced necrosis in the absence of GA (Fig. 1, B and C). To exclude the possibility that the effect described may not arise from a side effect of GA, we analyzed the effect of a structurally unrelated inhibitor of HSP90, viz. radicicol. Pretreatment of the cells with radicicol also caused a shift from necrosis to apoptosis in response to TNF (data not shown). These results confirm that inhibition of HSP90 in L929sA cells reverts TNFR1-induced necrotic cell death to apoptosis. In a previous report we demonstrated that the antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole can shift the response of L929sAhFas cells to treatment with the combination of interferon and dsRNA from necrosis to apoptosis. This shift occurred at the mitochondrial level and was completely blocked by overexpression of BCL-2 (5Denecker G. Vercammen D. Steemans M. Vanden Berghe T. Brouckaert G. Van Loo G. Zhivotovsky B. Fiers W. Grooten J. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 829-840Google Scholar, 22Kalai M. Van Loo G. Vanden Berghe T. Meeus A. Burm W. Saelens X. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 981-994Google Scholar). Because tBid generation and cytochrome crelease were observed also in cells treated with the combination of GA and TNF (Fig. 1 C), we investigated whether or not TNFR1-induced apoptosis in the presence of GA is dependent on the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. We analyzed the effect of GA on TNF-induced necrosis in L929sAhFasBCL2 cells stably transfected withBcl-2. Signaling through the intrinsic pathway, originating at the mitochondria, is attenuated in these cells (5Denecker G. Vercammen D. Steemans M. Vanden Berghe T. Brouckaert G. Van Loo G. Zhivotovsky B. Fiers W. Grooten J. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 829-840Google Scholar, 22Kalai M. Van Loo G. Vanden Berghe T. Meeus A. Burm W. Saelens X. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 981-994Google Scholar). In comparison with parental L929sAhFas, a substantial delay in apoptotic cell death induced by TNF in the presence of GA was observed in L929sAhFasBCL2 cells, as revealed by uptake of propidium iodide and hypoploidy (Fig. 2 A,left). Although overexpression of BCL-2 had a partial inhibitory effect on apoptosis induced by TNF and GA, as demonstrated by the decrease in caspase-3 activity (Fig.2, A and B, left), the cells still responded by apoptosis. A similar effect on FAS-mediated apoptosis was observed before (5Denecker G. Vercammen D. Steemans M. Vanden Berghe T. Brouckaert G. Van Loo G. Zhivotovsky B. Fiers W. Grooten J. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 829-840Google Scholar, 22Kalai M. Van Loo G. Vanden Berghe T. Meeus A. Burm W. Saelens X. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 981-994Google Scholar), suggesting that the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway amplifies the apoptotic death process, and in its absence the process is delayed. Moreover, tBid generation during TNF/GA treatment clearly preceded cytochrome c release (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that the shift to apoptosis occurred upstream to the mitochondria. Caspase-8 is required for death receptor-induced apoptosis and is a known Bid-cleaving protease (23Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1156-1163Google Scholar, 24Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17484-17490Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the apoptotic process was initiated by caspase-8 by analyzing the effect of GA on TNFR1-induced cell death response in L929sACrmA cells. CrmA, the viral serpin-like inhibitor of caspase-8, should block death receptor-induced apoptosis in these cells. Contrary to their parental L929sA cells, the L929sACrmA cells still died by necrosis when treated with TNF after pretreatment with GA. Indeed, no hypoploidy, caspase-3 activity, or caspase-3 cleavage was detected (Fig. 2, A and B, right). Inhibition of caspase activation by pretreatment with zVAD-fmk yielded similar results in L929sA cells (Fig. 2 C). In both cases, cells responded to TNF by necrosis even after pretreatment with GA. However, cell death was delayed in comparison with cells treated with TNF in the absence of GA (Fig. 2 C). Thus, inhibition of caspase-8 blocks TNFR1-induced apoptosis in the presence of GA. This finding suggests that the apoptotic process induced by TNF in the presence of GA is mediated through activation of caspase-8, a receptor-mediated event. The above results show that an efficient necrotic response requires a functional HSP90 and suggest that one or more of the chaperone's client proteins are involved in the TNFR1 complex signaling to necrosis or in the prevention of apoptosis. Therefore, we investigated the effect of HSP90 inhibition by GA on the expression levels of different TNFR1 complex-associated adaptor proteins, kinases, and caspases. Western blot analysis of different kinases revealed that the detected levels of RIP, RAF-1, IKK-α, and IKK-β are decreased in the presence of GA, whereas those of ERK, p38MAPK, JNK, and dsRNA-activated protein kinase are not affected (Fig. 3 A). No, or a minor effect on the expression levels of adaptors recruited to the TNFR1 complex, such as TRADD and FADD, was detected (Fig.3 A). However, a decrease in the expression levels of two RIP-interacting proteins, TRAF2 and NEMO, was clearly apparent in cells treated with GA (Fig. 3 A). TRAF2 is an adaptor protein known also to interact with TRADD and TNFR2 (25Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Google Scholar), whereas NEMO is a scaffold protein playing a central role in the assembly of the IKK complex (26Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Google Scholar, 27Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Google Scholar, 28Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Young D.B. Li J.W. Pascual G. Motiwala A. Zhu H. Mann M. Manning A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1526-1538Google Scholar, 29Li Y. Kang J. Friedman J. Tarassishin L. Ye J. Kovalenko A. Wallach D. Horwitz M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1042-1047Google Scholar). We could not detect any change in the levels of caspase-3, -8, and -9. Surprisingly, caspase-2 levels clearly dropped in the presence of GA. Several reports demonstrated that the decrease in expression levels of HSP90 client proteins is caused by degradation by the proteasome (15Schulte T.W. An W.G. Neckers L.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 655-659Google Scholar, 16Mimnaugh E.G. Chavany C. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22796-22801Google Scholar). Indeed, 1 h of treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was sufficient to restore approximately half of the expression level of RIP that was lost because of 15 h of preincubation with GA (Fig. 3 B). Several reports using knockout mice demonstrated that RIP and TRAF2 are involved in the activation of NF-κB (30Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Google Scholar, 31Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Google Scholar). RIP was also shown to be involved in the activation of JNK and p38MAPK (32Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Google Scholar, 33Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Google Scholar). Moreover, disruption of HSP90 function was reported to result in blockage of NF-κB activation (19Lewis J. Devin A. Miller A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Neckers L. Liu Z.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10519-10526Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether degradation of RIP, IKK-α, IKK-β and, to a lesser extent, NEMO and TRAF2 in the presence of GA abrogated the activation of NF-κB, JNK, and p38MAPK in L929sA cells. First, we analyzed the effect of GA on the TNF-induced secretion of IL-6, one of the major NF-κB-regulated cytokines. In the presence of GA, TNF-induced IL-6 production was blocked completely; also, the basal level of IL-6 was decreased (Fig.4 A). Next we analyzed the activation of JNK and p38MAPK by Western blotting using phosphospecific antibodies. In the absence of GA, TNF treatment led to an early transient activation of JNK and p38MAPK (Fig. 4 B). The activation of JNK was more prolonged than that of p38MAPK. The primary transient activation of p38MAPK was followed by a secondary activation (Fig. 4 B). Such a biphasic activation pattern for MAPKs in response to a combined treatment with TNF and cycloheximide was reported previously (34Roulston A. Reinhard C. Amiri P. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10232-10239Google Scholar). The activation of both MAPKs by TNF was prevented by pretreatment with GA. In conclusion, these results show that the expression levels of TNFR1 adaptor protein FADD and the initiator caspase-8 required to initiate apoptosis are not affected by the pretreatment of GA. However, the expression levels of RIP, IKK-α, IKK-β, NΕΜΟ, and TRAF2 are reduced by pretreatment with GA. As a consequence, NF-κB, p38MAPK, and JNK activation are abolished. The restoration of the expression level of RIP by inhibiting the proteasome suggests that treatment with GA leads to degradation of HSP90 client proteins.Figure 4Preincubation of L929sA cells with GA blocks activation of NF-κB, p38MAPK, and JNK.A, cells were pretreated with 1 μm GA for 16 h followed by addition of a serial dilution of hTNF ranging between 3.2 and 104 units/ml during 24 h. Secreted IL-6 in the supernatant was quantified using a bioassay. B, cells were treated with and without 1 μm GA for 16 h followed by treatment with hTNF for the indicated time points. Equal amount of total lysates were loaded and analyzed by Western blotting (WB) using antibodies that specifically recognize the phosphorylated form of p38MAPK and JNK. As a control for equal loading, lysates were analyzed with antibodies against the nonphosphorylated form of p38MAPK.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our results demonstrate that pretreatment with the HSP90 inhibitors GA or radicicol shifts the response to TNF from necrosis to apoptosis in L929sA cells. Several lines of evidence suggest that the shift occurs at the receptor level. First, cleavage of Bid preceded cytochrome c release. Second, overexpression of the caspase-8 inhibitor CrmA abolished the shift from necrosis to apoptosis. Third, BCL-2 overexpression decreased the apoptotic response but did not block it, although BCL-2 overexpression in these cells was able to block the conversion of necrotic to apoptotic signaling induced by dsRNA and interferon in the presence of the antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole (22Kalai M. Van Loo G. Vanden Berghe T. Meeus A. Burm W. Saelens X. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 981-994Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations indicate that in L929sA cells the shift from necrotic to apoptotic cell death in the case of TNF/GA occurs at the receptor level, whereas the shift induced on dsRNA/interferon/butylated hydroxyanisole treatment occurs at the mitochondrial level. Inhibition of necrotic cell death by GA has been reported in Jurkat cells treated with FasL in the presence of zVAD-fmk (8Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Google Scholar). In addition, GA can protect caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells from dsRNA-induced necrosis (22Kalai M. Van Loo G. Vanden Berghe T. Meeus A. Burm W. Saelens X. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 981-994Google Scholar). Several reports suggest that the availability of certain proteins such as FADD, caspase-8, RIP, and/or still unknown proteins can determine whether necrosis or apoptosis occurs. FADD or caspase-8 deficiency has been reported to protect Jurkat cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis (35Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Google Scholar, 36Juo P. Woo M.S. Kuo C.J. Signorelli P. Biemann H.P. Hannun Y.A. Blenis J. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 797-804Google Scholar, 37Matsumura H. Shimizu Y. Ohsawa Y. Kawahara A. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1247-1256Google Scholar, 38Kawahara A. Ohsawa Y. Matsumura H. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1353-1360Google Scholar), whereas RIP deficiency protects these cells from necrosis (8Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Google Scholar). This finding implies that death receptors can initiate two alternative cell death pathways, one relying on FADD and caspase-8 and the other dependent on the kinase RIP. Indeed, FADD-deficient Jurkat cells respond to TNF by necrosis (8Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Google Scholar, 22Kalai M. Van Loo G. Vanden Berghe T. Meeus A. Burm W. Saelens X. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 981-994Google Scholar). Similarly, dsRNA-induced apoptosis shifts to necrosis in FADD- or caspase-8-deficient Jurkats, whereas dsRNA-induced necrosis is blocked in RIP-deficient Jurkats (22Kalai M. Van Loo G. Vanden Berghe T. Meeus A. Burm W. Saelens X. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 981-994Google Scholar). Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that signaling compounds in necrosis and apoptosis compete and counteract each other. In necrotic cell death, RIP leads to anti-apoptotic signals by the activation of NF-κB and the MAPKs (30Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Google Scholar,33Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Google Scholar). In apoptosis, caspase-8 cleaves RIP and thus may block these anti-apoptotic signals (39Lin Y. Devin A. Rodriguez Y. Liu Z.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2514-2526Google Scholar, 40Martinon F. Holler N. Richard C. Tschopp J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 134-136Google Scholar, 41Kim J.W. Choi E.J. Joe C.O. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4491-4499Google Scholar). These results suggest that TNFR1-induced necrosis and apoptosis use distinct proteins/components in their signaling pathways. GA prevents the ATP-dependent release from HSP90 of a client protein undergoing refolding leading to its degradation (14Schneider C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Nimmesgern E. Ouerfelli O. Danishefsky S. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14536-14541Google Scholar, 15Schulte T.W. An W.G. Neckers L.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 655-659Google Scholar, 16Mimnaugh E.G. Chavany C. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22796-22801Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed the effect of the inhibition of HSP90 by GA on the expression levels of TNFR1-related adaptor proteins, kinases, and caspases. Our results show that GA induces a decrease in the expression levels of RIP, IKK-α, IKK-β and, to a lesser extent, of NEMO, TRAF2, and RAF-1, whereas no significant drop in the expression levels of the MAPKs, dsRNA-activated protein kinase, and adaptors of the TNFR1 complex such as TRADD and FADD was observed. The degradation of RIP and RAF-1 in the presence of GA confirms previous reports (15Schulte T.W. An W.G. Neckers L.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 655-659Google Scholar,19Lewis J. Devin A. Miller A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Neckers L. Liu Z.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10519-10526Google Scholar). The strong drop of the expression levels of IKK-α/β in the presence of GA suggests that both kinases are also client proteins of HSP90. Indeed, a recent report demonstrated that the IKK complex, which contains the two catalytic subunits IKK-α and IKK-β and a regulatory subunit NEMO, forms a ∼900-kDa heterocomplex with Cdc37 and HSP90 (42Chen G. Cao P. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 401-410Google Scholar). Contrary to our results, the authors could not detect any degradation of the IKK-α/β in HeLa cells after 15 h of GA treatment. Nevertheless, inhibition of HSP90 in the latter cells prevented the recruitment of the IKK complex to TNFR1. The observation that NEMO and TRAF2 are significantly less degraded in the presence of GA than RIP, IKK-α, and IKK-β, suggests that no direct interaction occurs between HSP90 and TRAF2 or NEMO. The latter might be degraded because of their recruitment to complexes containing either RIP or IKK-α and IKK-β. Similarly, the decrease in the level of caspase-2 in cells treated with GA may be caused by an indirect interaction of caspase-2 with RIP via RIP-associated Ich-1/CED-3 homologous protein with a death domain (43Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Google Scholar). Holler and colleagues (8Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Google Scholar) suggested that GA inhibits necrotic cell death because of the degradation of RIP. However, our data show that necrotic cell death can still occur in the presence of zVAD-fmk or CrmA, although RIP is degraded by GA treatment. This finding suggests that other proteins (kinases) may have an important role in signaling to necrosis or that the small amount of RIP still present in the GA-treated cells is sufficient to allow the necrotic process to occur. RIP, IKK-α, IKK-β, NEMO, and TRAF2 are involved in the signaling to NF-κB, p38MAPK, and JNK (44Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Google Scholar, 45English J. Pearson G. Wilsbacher J. Swantek J. Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 255-270Google Scholar). NF-κB activation has been implicated in the suppression of apoptosis. For example,RelA −/− mice die at embryonic day 15 as a result of extensive liver apoptosis (44Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Google Scholar, 46Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Google Scholar). Other studies indicate that an early but brief activation of JNK and/or p38MAPK may protect cells from TNF-induced apoptosis (34Roulston A. Reinhard C. Amiri P. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10232-10239Google Scholar). Indeed, pretreatment with GA blocks TNF-induced activation of NF-κB, p38MAPK, and JNK in our cells, again favoring the apoptotic cell death process. Our results show that TRADD, FADD, and caspase-3, -8, and -9, which are involved in the apoptotic-signaling pathway, are not affected by the pretreatment with GA. This finding suggests that inhibition of HSP90 alters the composition of the TNFR1 complex, favoring the TRADD-FADD-caspase-8 pathway and thus apoptosis (Fig.5, right). This fact implies that in the absence of GA one or more HSP90-interacting proteins needed for the induction of necrosis induced by TNF are probably recruited more efficiently to the TNFR1-complex (Fig. 5, left). These proteins may prevent apoptosis by competing with FADD or caspase-8 for recruitment to the TNFR1-complex and by initiating anti-apoptotic mechanisms through NF-κB (30Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Google Scholar, 31Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Google Scholar) and activation of JNK and/or p38MAPK (32Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Google Scholar, 33Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Google Scholar). Additionally, they may actively contribute to the signaling to and the execution of the necrotic process. In L929sA cells we have shown before that butylated hydroxyanisole blocks necrosis induced by TNF (6Vercammen D. Beyaert R. Denecker G. Goossens V. Van Loo G. Declercq W. Grooten J. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1477-1485Google Scholar) or anti-Fas plus zVAD-fmk (7Vercammen D. Brouckaert G. Denecker G. Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 919-930Google Scholar) and shifts the response to dsRNA/interferon from necrosis to apoptosis (22Kalai M. Van Loo G. Vanden Berghe T. Meeus A. Burm W. Saelens X. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 981-994Google Scholar). These observations argue for a role of oxygen radical production in the execution of the necrotic process. One of the currently emerging questions is why two distinct cell death programs did evolve that seem to negatively influence each other's pathway. Apoptosis might be blocked in several pathophysiological conditions as these often coincide with inflammation. During inflammation NF-κB- and MAPK-dependent transcription occurs, leading to the expression of several anti-apoptotic proteins such as X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, Bcl-2, and cellular Flice-like inhibitory protein (47Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5923-5929Google Scholar, 48Micheau O. Lens S. Gaide O. Alevizopoulos K. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5299-5305Google Scholar, 49Lin H. Chen C. Li X. Chen B.D. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 272: 192-198Google Scholar). Certain viruses up-regulate endogenous inhibitors of apoptosis and/or encode for caspase inhibitors (e.g. p35, CrmA, viral Flice-like inhibitory protein, viral inhibitor of apoptosis) (50Ekert P.G. Silke J. Vaux D.L. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1081-1086Google Scholar). Moreover, tumor cells often carry mutations leading to the inactivation of apoptosis-initiating proteins or caspases (51Green D.R. Evan G.I. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 19-30Google Scholar). Thus, necrosis may function as a backup program resistant to or even enhanced by the factors blocking the apoptotic signaling (6Vercammen D. Beyaert R. Denecker G. Goossens V. Van Loo G. Declercq W. Grooten J. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1477-1485Google Scholar). Apoptosis coupled to phagocytosis is an efficient way of clearing dying cells (52Franc N.C. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d1298-d1313Google Scholar). In necrosis, cytosolic constituents leak into the intercellular space through damaged plasma membrane and may provoke a strong immune response that may be physiologically important during certain dangerous situations such as viral or bacterial infection, traumas, and cancer (53Sauter B. Albert M.L. Francisco L. Larsson M. Somersan S. Bhardwaj N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 423-434Google Scholar, 54Todryk S. Melcher A.A. Hardwick N. Linardakis E. Bateman A. Colombo M.P. Stoppacciaro A.

The choice between these cell death pathways depends on the availability of certain adaptor proteins. We suggest that inhibition of HSP90 by GA is favoring an apoptotic TNFR1 complex, whereas in the absence of GA, a pronecrotic TNFR1 complex is formed in which RIP and/or other HSP90-interacting proteins are preferably recruited.

Here we show that the Kai proteins and SasA form heteromultimeric protein complexes dynamically in a circadian fashion. KaiC forms protein complexes of ∼350 and 400–600 kDa during the subjective day and night, respectively, and serves as a core of the circadian protein complexes. This change in the size of the KaiC-containing complex is accompanied by nighttime-specific interaction of KaiA and KaiB with KaiC. In various arrhythmic mutants that lack each functional Kai protein or SasA, circadian rhythms in formation of the clock protein complex are abolished, and the size of the protein complexes is dramatically affected. Thus, circadian-regulated formation of the clock protein complexes is probably a critical process in the generation of circadian rhythm in cyanobacteria.

At the molecular level, several clock-related genes have been identified and intensively analyzed in cyanobacteria,Neurospora, Arabidopsis, Drosophila, and mammals (1Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar, 2Young M.W. Kay S.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 702-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Cyanobacteria are the simplest organisms known to have the circadian clock and provide both genetic and physiological model systems (3Iwasaki H. Kondo T.

Previously we have monitored circadian gene expression in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 using a bioluminescence (luciferase) reporter gene set (5Kondo T. Strayer C.A.

A. 1993; 90: 5672-5676Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), isolated various mutants that impaired normal circadian phenotypes (6Kondo T. Tsinoremas N.F. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kutsuna S. Ishiura M. Science. 1994; 266: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and identified the clock gene cluster kaiABC (7Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Molecular genetic studies suggested functions of KaiA and KaiC as positive and negative elements for kaiBC expression, respectively, to form a negative feedback loop (7Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). This regulatory loop has been proposed as an important step to drive circadian oscillation in kaiBCexpression (7Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the cyanobacterial circadian clock, it is essential to discover the biochemical properties of the Kai proteins. KaiB and KaiC accumulate in a circadian fashion in cyanobacterial cells, peaking at circadian time (CT)1 15–16 in continuous light conditions. (CT indicates the subjective time of a day (h) in constant environmental conditions; CT 0 corresponds to the subjective dawn. In contrast, Zeitgeber time (ZT) is used to indicate time in a light-day cycle; ZT 0 indicates dawn time in a light-day cycle.) This accumulation follows kaiBC mRNA rhythms by ∼8 h (8Xu Y. Mori T. Johnson C.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3349-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). KaiC binds to ATP in vitro through nucleotide-binding domains (P-loops), and mutations of these motifs severely alter the circadian function (4Mori T. Johnson C.H. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 9Nishiwaki T. Iwasaki H. Ishiura M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Moreover, KaiC undergoes autophosphorylationin vitro (9Nishiwaki T. Iwasaki H. Ishiura M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Another important characteristic of the Kai proteins is their physical association in various combinations in yeast cells, in vitro, and in Synechococcus cells (10Iwasaki H. Taniguchi Y. Ishiura M. Kondo T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A long period mutation of KaiA affects the strength of the KaiA-KaiC interaction, suggesting an important role of such protein interactions in circadian time-keeping (10Iwasaki H. Taniguchi Y. Ishiura M. Kondo T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We have also identified another KaiC-interacting partner, SasA, which is a sensory histidine kinase (11Iwasaki H. Williams S.B. Kitayama Y. Ishiura M. Golden S.S. Kondo T. Cell. 2000; 101: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Although SasA is not an essential oscillator component, SasA is important in enhancing kaiBC expression and likely forms a secondary loop with KaiC to stabilize the Kai-based primary molecular circuit. SasA is also involved in metabolic growth control under day/night cycle conditions (11Iwasaki H. Williams S.B. Kitayama Y. Ishiura M. Golden S.S. Kondo T. Cell. 2000; 101: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, biochemical functions and molecular behaviors of the Kai proteins and SasA remain largely unknown in Synechococcus cells. In this study, we biochemically examined temporal profiles of the clock protein interactions in Synechococcus. Gel filtration chromatographic analysis demonstrated that the Kai proteins and SasA form large protein complexes and suggested that the complexes change their stoichiometry during the circadian cycle. Immunoprecipitation studies confirmed that the Kai proteins and SasA circadianly associate in large KaiC-containing protein complexes. Dramatic changes in the size of Kai/SasA-containing complexes in kaiA-,kaiB-, kaiC-, and sasA-inactivated strains further support that circadian formation of the clock protein complexes has a function in the circadian regulatory mechanism. NUC39 and NUC38 (10Iwasaki H. Taniguchi Y. Ishiura M. Kondo T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) were used as the wild-type and kaiABC-depletedSynechococcus strains, respectively. We also usedkaiA-, kaiB-, and kaiC-inactivated strains (7Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), a sasA-disrupted strain (11Iwasaki H. Williams S.B. Kitayama Y. Ishiura M. Golden S.S. Kondo T.

S. A. 2000; 97: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Synechococcus cells were grown at 30 °C in BG-11 liquid medium under continuous light (LL) conditions of 46 μmol−2 s−1 from white fluorescent lamps. Synechococcus cells were grown in BG-11 liquid medium to an optical density of 0.2 at 730 nm (OD730). The cells were exposed to two cycles of 12-h light/12-h dark (LD) alternation and then placed in LL conditions and harvested in LD and LL. The cell pellets were collected from the culture and then immediately resuspended in 200 μl of binding buffer, BB5 (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% glycerol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 mg/ml DNase I, pH 8.0), and disrupted by sonication using the Ultrasonic Liquid Processor (Misonix) or the BioRupter (Cosmo) at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the resulting supernatant was used for immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, or gel filtration chromatographic analyses. Immunoblot analyses, shown in Figs. 1 and 4 B, were performed with 5 μg of total cell extracts that were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10 or 15% gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The KaiA, KaiB, KaiC, and SasA proteins were analyzed with specific antisera (10Iwasaki H. Taniguchi Y. Ishiura M. Kondo T.

The specificities of these antibodies have been confirmed and described previously (10Iwasaki H. Taniguchi Y. Ishiura M. Kondo T.

Cell extracts were collected fromkaiA-inactivated (kaiA −),kaiB-inactivated (kaiB −),kaiC-disrupted (ΔkaiC), kaiABCcluster-depleted (ΔkaiABC), and sasA-disrupted (ΔsasA) strains and an arrhythmic KaiC P-loop mutant (K52H) strain. Gel filtration and immunoblotting assays were performed as described in Fig. 2 A. Profiles of subjective night-specific large clock protein complex formations in wild-type strains are also shown as a control (WT). The Kai proteins and SasA did not form large protein complexes in thekaiC-disrupted and K52H strains. kaiA- andkaiB-null mutants also showed abnormalities in clock protein complex formation (see text).

Briefly, protein extracts in 360 μl of BB5 (total, 500 μg of protein) were prepared as described above. Then the extracts were supplemented with 40 μl of 5% bovine serum albumin in 0.1 m KCl and then incubated with a 10-μl bed volume of prewashed AffiGel-Hz beads (Bio-Rad) coupled to purified rabbit anti-KaiC IgG at 4 °C for 2 h. After six washes with 1 ml of BB5 without DNase I, the beads were resuspended in 80 μl of SDS sample buffer without reducing agents. Proteins were eluted by vortexing gently for 10 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected, supplemented with 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% bromphenol blue, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. All protein chromatographic steps were performed with an Amersham Biosciences FPLC system. Aliquots (100 μl) of cell extracts in BB5 as prepared above were size-fractionated by gel filtration chromatography with Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. Protein standards used for calibration of the gel filtration column included thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), lactose dehydrogenase (140 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14.4 kDa). The protein samples fractionated by gel filtration chromatography were precipitated with trichloroacetate, and each was resolved in 50 μl of the SDS sample buffer. Five microliters of each sample were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Two or three independent experiments obtained similar results at each time point. To analyze temporal dynamics of clock protein interactions, we first evaluated the temporal accumulation profiles of the Kai proteins and SasA in Synechococcus cells. Soluble protein extracts were prepared from cells that had been collected at 4-h intervals either during one LD cycle or during LL conditions. Immunoblotting analysis confirmed that the amounts of the KaiB and KaiC proteins oscillate, peaking at subjective dusk, and the amount of KaiA protein oscillates with a low amplitude rhythm under an LD cycle or LL conditions (Fig. 1 A) as reported previously (8Xu Y. Mori T. Johnson C.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3349-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). KaiC is a master circadian regulator, proposed to be a negative factor for kaiBC expression (7Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Recent analysis suggested that KaiC is also responsible for activation of the kaiBCpromoter (11Iwasaki H. Williams S.B. Kitayama Y. Ishiura M. Golden S.S. Kondo T. Cell. 2000; 101: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To examine whether KaiC interacts with other clock-related proteins, such as positive factors KaiA and SasA, in a phase-dependent manner, we performed co-immunoprecipitation analysis using anti-KaiC antiserum. The resulting immunoprecipitated materials were blotted and probed with anti-KaiA, anti-KaiB, anti-KaiC, or anti-SasA antiserum. The results demonstrated that KaiC interacts rhythmically with KaiA, KaiB, and SasA (Fig. 1 B). KaiA, KaiB, and SasA bound to KaiC more abundantly during subjective night in LL. The level of SasA interacting with KaiC was abundant at 12–16 in LL; KaiC also accumulated abundantly at this time. On the other hand, the levels of KaiA and KaiB interacting with KaiC followed the KaiC accumulation rhythms with a 4-h delay, peaking at hours 20–24 in LL (see “Discussion”). The Kai proteins and SasA interact in a circadian manner, but the in vivo dynamics of their complex formation is still largely unknown. To estimate the size of clock protein-containing complexes in cells, soluble protein extracts were prepared from Synechococcus cells at hours 4, 10, 16, and 22 in LD cycles, size-fractionated by filtration chromatography, and then subjected to immunoblotting analyses. As shown in Fig. 2 A, KaiA showed a dramatic change in its size throughout an LD cycle. KaiA occurred as a complex of ∼60 kDa, which is close to the size of a KaiA dimer at ZT 10, whereas it occurred as both a ∼500-kDa complex and as the ∼60-kDa complex at ZT 16. At ZT 22 and ZT 4, KaiA was fractionated more broadly, and the ∼60-kDa complex and a fraction tail of smaller size were more abundant at ZT 4. These results indicate that KaiA forms larger protein complexes in the night and is present in smaller forms in the day. KaiB was fractionated mainly as two portions: a broad tail of the larger fractions (200–600 kDa) and a smaller ∼20-kDa fraction, which is close to the size of a KaiB dimer. At ZT 10, KaiB was mainly found in the ∼20-kDa fraction. By contrast, at ZT 22 most of KaiB molecules were present in larger complex fractions, and only faint signals were detected from the ∼20-kDa portion. KaiC forms protein complexes of ∼350 kDa at ZT 4 and 10, whereas it was present in larger complexes of 500–670 kDa at ZT 16 and 22. Less KaiC was detected at ZT 10 and 16 in a fraction of the ∼60-kDa portion, which might corresponded to its monomeric form. SasA was found during the daytime (ZT 4 and 10) in mainly two portions, peaking at 400–600 and 200 kDa, respectively. In the nighttime (ZT 16 and 22), the 200-kDa signal disappeared, and SasA was present as large protein complexes of 400–600 kDa. As summarized in Fig. 2 B, these data show that during the night all four clock-related proteins were mainly co-fractionated in ∼400–600-kDa portions, whereas they separated into different fractions during the daytime, especially at ZT 10. Next we examined the size of the clock-related proteins in cells cultured under LL conditions after two LD cycles (Fig. 3 A). The results were essentially similar to those under LD cycles. Clock-related protein molecules were more abundant during subjective night, occurring as 400–600-kDa protein complexes, and they separated into different fractions during subjective day (Fig. 3 B). All these results support the hypothesis that the clock-related proteins interact with each other and form large protein complexes during (subjective) night and tend to dissociate from each other during (subjective) day. To characterize the nighttime-specific large complexes, we performed gel filtration chromatography on the Kai and SasA proteins from various clock gene-inactivated strains (Fig. 4 A). Inactivation of thekaiA, kaiB, or kaiC gene each abolishes circadian rhythms (7Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), and disruption of the sasAgene reduces kaiBC expression with lowered amplitude and a shortened period length in a light intensity-dependent manner (11Iwasaki H. Williams S.B. Kitayama Y. Ishiura M. Golden S.S. Kondo T. Cell. 2000; 101: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In both kaiB- and kaiC-null mutants, KaiA failed to form the 400–500-kDa complex and was present predominantly as the ∼60-kDa form throughout the day (Fig. 4 A; data not shown). These results indicate that both KaiB and KaiC are required for the 400–600-kDa KaiA-containing complex during the (subjective) night. KaiB also failed to form the large complex in both kaiA- andkaiC-null mutants and was exclusively present as a 20-kDa form. Thus, both KaiA and KaiC are necessary for the large KaiB-containing protein complex. In both kaiA- and kaiB-null strains, KaiC and SasA were co-present as 440–670-kDa forms, which are significantly larger than the major form of the night-specific KaiC complex. The size of these complexes is, however, very close to that of the larger SasA complex or larger tail of the KaiC complex in the wild-type strain in LL 22 (Fig. 4 A). The 440–670-kDa SasA-containing complex in the mutant strains probably contains KaiC because this form is dramatically reduced in the kaiC-null mutant (Fig. 4 A). These results support the hypothesis that SasA serves as a main partner for KaiC in the absence of KaiA or KaiB (see “Discussion”). We also characterized the size of Kai protein complexes in thesasA-deficient strain under LL conditions (50 μmol m−2 s−1). Under these conditions, the mutant strain is arrhythmic with severely reduced levels of KaiB and KaiC (11Iwasaki H. Williams S.B. Kitayama Y. Ishiura M. Golden S.S. Kondo T. Cell. 2000; 101: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). KaiA was fractionated as ∼60-kDa proteins in thesasA-null mutant and was not present in the 400–600-kDa fractions as was the case in the kaiC-deficient strain (Fig. 4 A). We were unable to obtain reliable data on the size of these proteins by gel filtration because of their low concentrations. To better understand the relationship between a biochemical property of KaiC and the protein complex formation, we analyzed in vivoclock protein behaviors in a KaiC(K52H) strain in which an ATP-binding domain of KaiC (P-loop1) was mutated (9Nishiwaki T. Iwasaki H. Ishiura M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This mutation dramatically reduces the ATP binding activity of KaiC in vitro, and the mutant cyanobacterial strain nullifies the circadian clock (9Nishiwaki T. Iwasaki H. Ishiura M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We first examined the level of the Kai proteins and SasA in the mutant. Accumulation of all four proteins did not exhibit any detectable circadian fluctuations (Fig. 4 B). Compared with wild-type strains, KaiA and KaiB were present constitutively at relatively high levels. In contrast, the accumulation level of KaiC was reduced dramatically in this strain (Fig. 4 B). Because the kaiBC promoter activity is not evidently down-regulated in the KaiC(K52H) strain (9Nishiwaki T. Iwasaki H. Ishiura M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), it is plausible that the ATP binding property is important for stability of the KaiC protein. The level of SasA in the mutant strain was similar to that in the wild-type cells. Immunoprecipitation analysis using anti-KaiC antiserum failed to detect KaiC-interacting KaiA or KaiB protein, but faint signals were observed for SasA bound to KaiC (Fig. 4 C). Gel filtration analysis followed by immunoblotting confirmed that, in the KaiC(K52H) mutant, KaiA and KaiB did not form the protein complexes of >400 kDa and instead were found only in distinct fractions of ∼60 and ∼14 kDa, respectively (Fig4 A). SasA was dominantly found as a complex of ∼140 kDa, while lesser amounts of SasA were also detected broadly in fractions of ∼400–600 kDa (data not shown). These profiles were essentially the same as in the kaiC-deficient mutant (Fig. 4 A) and were the same as the day phase patterns in the wild-type strain (Fig. 3). All the results mentioned above support KaiC as a scaffold protein for the heteromultimeric clock protein complexes. Thus, an immunoprecipitation assay with anti-KaiC antiserum was performed using KaiC-containing fractions after the gel filtration assay (fractions 19–24, 28, and 29), and results were examined to determine whether KaiA, KaiB, and SasA were co-precipitated with KaiC. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, KaiA and KaiB interacted with KaiC solidly in the 400–600-kDa fractions, peaking at ∼500 kDa during the subjective night. The SasA protein interacted with KaiC in the 400–670-kDa complexes, especially in the 500–670-kDa region. The level of SasA bound to KaiC also exhibited a circadian rhythm, while the amplitude was lower compared with the rhythms of KaiA and KaiB interacting with KaiC. These results further confirmed that the Kai proteins and SasA interact to form 400–670-kDa protein complexes in a circadian fashion. We have previously demonstrated that KaiC enhances KaiA-KaiB interaction in vitro and in the yeast two-hybrid system and predicted formation of a heteromultimeric complex that contains the three Kai proteins (10Iwasaki H. Taniguchi Y. Ishiura M. Kondo T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We also reported limited information on KaiC-SasA and KaiB-SasA interactions in cyanobacteria by immunoprecipitation analysis at two points of the day (11Iwasaki H. Williams S.B. Kitayama Y. Ishiura M. Golden S.S. Kondo T. Cell. 2000; 101: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In contrast, this report provides more comprehensive details on in vivo dynamics of the clock protein complex formation, which must be a basis for understanding molecular actions of these circadian clock elements in the cell. Our results showed that the Kai proteins and SasA are present in various complexes during the circadian cycle. In the subjective day, KaiC forms complexes ranging from 350 to 440 kDa. The small KaiC-containing complex (350 kDa; fraction 23 in Figs. 2 and3) corresponds to the size of a KaiC hexamer (calculated mass of 354 kDa). This could be possible because the amino acid sequence of KaiC is similar to those of RecA/DnaB superfamily proteins, which generally form hexamers (12Leipe D.D. Aravind L. Grishin N.V. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 5-16PubMed Google Scholar). In the subjective night, KaiC additionally forms larger protein complexes, most commonly around 500 kDa (Figs. 2 and 3). Importantly, in kaiC-null mutant strains, KaiA, KaiB, and SasA did not form the large complexes, and all four clock proteins were dissociated from each other (Fig. 4 A). Therefore, we propose a role for KaiC (or the KaiC hexamer) as a scaffold protein to form the large heteromultimeric clock protein complexes. In addition to the complexes of >300 kDa, we observed that KaiA and KaiC from wild-type cells were also co-fractionated in ∼60-kDa fractions (Fig. 3). Two observations suggest that KaiA and KaiC are not associating with each other in a 60-kDa complex. First, these small KaiA and KaiC signals were not affected in kaiC- andkaiA-inactivated mutants, respectively (Fig. 4 A). Second, these ∼60-kDa forms of KaiA and KaiC did not co-immunoprecipitate (Fig. 5). Thus, these signals might simply represent a KaiA dimer (calculated mass of 65.2 kDa) and a KaiC monomer (58.0 kDa). Our results also revealed the importance of SasA for formation of heteromultimeric clock protein complexes. Because the KaiC-interacting sensory domain of SasA is similar to the full-length KaiB protein, KaiB and SasA have been proposed to compete with each other for binding to KaiC (11Iwasaki H. Williams S.B. Kitayama Y. Ishiura M. Golden S.S. Kondo T. Cell. 2000; 101: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Consistently in the kaiB-inactivated strain we found abnormal dominance of 500–670-kDa forms of KaiC, which co-fractionated with SasA. Dominance of these forms of KaiC was also observed in kaiA-null mutants, in which the levels of KaiB and KaiC were reduced, although the level of SasA was not affected (Fig. 4 A). Thus, molecular excess of SasA compared with KaiB and the absence of KaiA-KaiC interaction both could enhance KaiC-SasA interaction and reduce KaiB-KaiC association in thekaiA-inactivated strain. SasA is dominantly present as a 140–200-kDa form at CT 4 in the wild-type strain and throughout the circadian cycle in thekaiC-null and kaiABC-null mutants. Thus, SasA is capable of forming a multimeric protein complex even without the Kai proteins. Because histidine kinases often dimerize, a SasA dimer may be interacting solidly with a still unknown cognate response regulator to form the 140–200-kDa complex. Note that homotypic interaction of SasA has been demonstrated in vitro previously (11Iwasaki H. Williams S.B. Kitayama Y. Ishiura M. Golden S.S. Kondo T. Cell. 2000; 101: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The night-specific 500–670-kDa KaiC-containing complex might be formed by the binding of a 140–200-kDa SasA complex to a KaiC hexamer, which conjugates with KaiA and/or KaiB according to subjective time. So far, however, we do not have any evidence that SasA binds indirectly to KaiA or KaiB through association with a KaiA/KaiB-interacting KaiC complex. This lack of evidence is because our anti-KaiA, anti-KaiB, and anti-SasA antisera are not sufficient for immunoprecipitation studies. Nevertheless, it is plausible that there are several co-existing populations of multimeric complexes even during the late subjective night. It is necessary to find detailed stoichiometry of the complexes to gain a better understanding of the characteristics of the clock proteins. How do the clock protein complexes function for circadian timing in the cell? Considering a temporal profile of the clock protein complexes and a circadian kaiBC expression pattern, we speculate a certain day/night-specific Kai/SasA complex could be either a positive or negative regulator at certain times of the day for kaiBCgene expression. When the kaiBC expression level is low at CT 0 the Kai/SasA proteins form large complexes. By contrast, when thekaiBC mRNA level is high at CT 8–10 (7Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H.

Kondo T. Cell. 2000; 101: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), the Kai proteins and SasA dissociate from each other. Fig. 6 illustrates one possibility for akaiBC regulatory loop by these protein complexes. In the early subjective day, a smaller (∼60-kDa) KaiA-containing protein complex, possibly a KaiA dimer or a KaiB monomer or dimer, and a ∼350-kDa KaiC-containing protein complex (a hexamer?) accumulate in the Synechococcus cells. Thus, the small KaiA complex and/or the 350-kDa (smaller) KaiC complex may function as positive elements. There has been a speculation that the KaiC protein has some positive function (11Iwasaki H. Williams S.B. Kitayama Y. Ishiura M. Golden S.S. Kondo T. Cell. 2000; 101: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 13Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kitayama Y. Nakajima M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15788-15793Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). As a result, KaiB and KaiC accumulate, peaking at CT 16 at which time KaiA, KaiB, and SasA interact with the KaiC hexamer and kaiBC expression becomes reduced. At around CT 22, most KaiA, KaiB, and SasA molecules are complexed with KaiC, and thekaiBC mRNA reaches its trough level. We suggest the large KaiC complexes containing KaiA, KaiB, and SasA as negative regulators. When these complexes start dissociating and the KaiB and KaiC protein levels decrease in the next subjective early morning, the kaiBC transcription begins increasing by derepression. Interestingly, the peak of the Kai protein association is delayed several hours compared with that of KaiB and KaiC accumulation (Figs. 1 and 2). This may be an important step for producing a delay in the negative action to achieve proper 24-h molecular periodicity. We do not yet know how these protein complexes activate or inhibit thekaiBC promoter. It is possible that these protein complexes contain as yet unknown transcriptional activators or inhibitors. Alternatively, the circadianly changing KaiC-containing complexes might affect the topology or superhelicity of the chromosomal DNA, thereby affecting gene expression, as proposed (4Mori T. Johnson C.H. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) with respect to a similarity of the primary structure of KaiC to those of RecA (recombinase) and DnaB (DNA helicase). Moreover, KaiC was recently found to be phosphorylated in a circadian fashion (13Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kitayama Y. Nakajima M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15788-15793Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and protein-protein interaction would affect this KaiC phosphorylation to modulate activities of the complexes. Finally, we found the accumulation level of KaiC was severely reduced in the KaiC(K52H) strain (Fig. 4 B). As thekaiBC promoter activity is not evidently down-regulated in this mutant (9Nishiwaki T. Iwasaki H. Ishiura M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), an ATP binding activity is probably important for the stability of the KaiC protein. Dissociation between the KaiA and KaiB proteins and their failure to form large protein complexes in the P-loop mutant seem primarily due to a dramatic loss of KaiC accumulation (Fig. 4 B). The KaiC level was too low in this mutant to obtain reliable information on the size of the mutant KaiC complex by the gel filtration assay under our experimental conditions. Another discovery related to the stability of the Kai proteins is the relatively enhanced accumulation levels of KaiB and KaiC in ZT 12–24 compared with those in CT (LL) 12–24 in the wild-type strains (Fig. 1). Although we do not know whether this is due to a dark/light-dependent control on transcription, translation, or degradation, this phenomenon might be related to entrainment of the clock by photic stimuli. We thank Takahiro Nakamura (Nagoya University), Takashi Kageyama (Kyoto University), and Toshio Iwasaki (Nippon Medical School) for technical suggestions, Jun Tomita (Nagoya University) for helpful discussion on the Kai protein accumulation profiles, Taeko Nishiwaki (Nagoya University) for theSynechococcus KaiC(K52H) strain, and our laboratory members for valuable comments."

Most studies addressing the regulation of apoptosis have focused on transcriptional control, signal transduction, and other post-translational regulatory events. More recently, it has become evident that apoptosis is also subject to translational control. Cap-dependent translation involves the assembly of initiation factors at the 5′ mRNA terminus to form the trimolecular cap binding complex, eIF4F. These factors include the cap-binding protein, eIF4E,1 an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, eIF4A, and an eIF4G polypeptide (eIF4GI or eIF4GII), which serves as a docking site for eIF4E and eIF4A (3Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hersey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translation Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). The function of eIF4E is negatively regulated by members of the translational repressor family, the eIF4E-binding proteins, that sequester eIF4E in a translationally inactive complex (4Raught B. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Sonenberg N. Hersey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translation Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 245-293Google Scholar). Growth factors and other pro-survival stimuli promote phosphorylation of the eIF4E-binding proteins. Hyperphosphorylated eIF4E-binding protein has a decreased affinity for eIF4E, resulting in its liberation to initiate translation. The activity of the cap-dependent translation initiation apparatus is a major determinant of cell fate during development (5Klein P.S. Melton D.A.

Polunovsky V.A. Bitterman P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2853-2861Google Scholar). The apoptotic program can be triggered through at least two distinct signaling pathways with the potential for cross-talk. One pathway, leading to activation of caspase-8, is triggered by ligation of specific cell surface death receptors, such as Fas/CD95 or tumor necrosis factor α receptor (20Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Google Scholar). The second pathway, initiated by various stressors such as cytotoxic drugs and radiation, is transduced through a caspase-2-mediated series of steps into mitochondrial release of cytochrome c (21Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y. Science. 2002; 297: 1352-1354Google Scholar). Subsequent formation of the apoptosome, a complex containing cytochrome c, adapter protein Apaf-1, and procaspase-9 leads to activation of caspase-9 (22Jiang X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31199-31203Google Scholar). When activated, caspases-8 and -9 activate effectors caspases-3, -6, and/or 7, which in turn cleave critical cellular targets, resulting in death (23Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Google Scholar). Proteins of the Bcl-2 family tightly regulate mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. Proapoptotic proteins, such as Bid, Bax, Bad, and Bak, form pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane, whereas the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, inhibit pore formation (24Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 209-216Google Scholar, 25Harrington E.A. Bennett M.R. Fanidi A. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3286-3295Google Scholar). In most cell types, these two pathways converge, and receptor-induced activation of caspase-8 also results in mitochondrial release of death promoters with subsequent activation of the apoptosome-dependent caspase cascade (26Sun X.M. MacFarlane M. Zhuang J. Wolf B.B. Green D.R. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5053-5060Google Scholar). Thus, the mitochondria integrate a variety of cell death signals, and the ability of Bcl-2/Bcl-XL to interdict apoptosis is one hallmark of mitochondrial involvement in the apoptotic pathway (27Sun X.M. Bratton S.B. Butterworth M. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11345-11351Google Scholar, 28Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Google Scholar). Despite the strong connection between translational control and apoptosis, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. We have previously demonstrated that over-expressed eIF4E averts Myc-dependent apoptosis, at least in part, through a cyclin D1-dependent process (17Tan A. Bitterman P. Sonenberg N. Peterson M. Polunovsky V. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1437-1447Google Scholar). To provide further insight into the mechanism of eIF4E rescue, we examined which steps in the apoptotic cascade were blocked by eIF4E in rat embryo fibroblasts sensitized to apoptosis by constitutive expression of c-Myc. Here we show that cells rescued by eIF4E neither release cytochrome c from their mitochondria nor do they activate any downstream steps in the apoptotic cascade. A survey of Bcl-2 family members in rescued fibroblasts revealed most to be in the basal state. However, Bcl-XL was dramatically increased due to the selective recruitment of Bcl-XL mRNA to ribosomes by eIF4E as well as from activation of pre-translational stages of Bcl-XLproduction. Experiments achieving gain and loss of Bcl-XLfunction indicated that factors other than Bcl-XL are involved in eIF4E-dependent blockade of cytochromec release. These data provide the first direct link between translationally mediated antiapoptotic signaling and the apoptotic machinery and underscore the pleotropic nature of survival signaling downstream of up-regulated eIF4E. Cell lines were derived from rat embryonic fibroblasts (REF) as described (17Tan A. Bitterman P. Sonenberg N. Peterson M. Polunovsky V. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1437-1447Google Scholar). REF/Myc cells, which overexpressed c-Myc, were provided by Dr. Weinberg (Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, MA). REF/Myc/4E cells were generated by transducing REF/Myc with retrovirus CRE-BCS encoding wild-type murine eIF4E (retrovirus was kindly provided by P. Leboulch, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA). Both REF/Myc and REF/Myc/4E cells were grown in complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin). Cells were subjected to proapoptotic conditions as specified in the text and figure legends. Both adherent and detached cells were collected, fixed in 70% ethanol, washed with PBS, and stained with propidium iodide stain mixture (50 μg/ml of propidium iodide, 0.1% Triton X-100, 32 μg/ml EDTA, 2.5 μg/ml RNase in PBS) for 45 min at 37 °C. DNA content was determined by quantitative flow cytometry using the CellQuest program. Cultured cells were rinsed in PBS, trypsinized, and collected by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton-X, 1% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A) and microcentrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was retained. The protein concentration was measured using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit. 20 μg of total protein was resolved by 15% SDS/PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with the following antibodies: anti-Bcl-XL (Trevigen), anti-Bcl-2 (Trevigen), anti-Bax (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Bad (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-actin (Sigma), anti-tubulin (Sigma), anti-caspase-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; Upstate Biotechnology). Cytochrome c was analyzed by subjecting 50 μg of cell free extract to 12% SDS/PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with mouse anti-cytochromec antibody (BD Biosciences). Blots were incubated with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody and detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were subjected to proapoptotic conditions, and both detached and adherent cells were collected, incubated with lysis buffer, and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g. Active caspase-3 was measured using a CleavaLite caspase-3 activity assay kit (Chemicon). 50 μg of lysate was added to a CleavaLite Renilla luciferase bioluminescent substrate that contains the caspase-3 cleavage site, DEVD. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, fresh luciferase substrate was added, and luminescence was read in a Lumat luminometer (EG&G Berthold). For caspase-9 activity, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min, supernatant was collected, and caspase-9 activity was determined by cleavage of LEHD-p-nitroanilide using a caspase-9 colorimetric assay (R&D systems). Adherent and floating cells were pooled and suspended in mitochondrial buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). Cells were mechanically lysed using a loose-fitting Wheaton cell homogenizer, and centrifuged at 1000 × gfor 10 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min to pellet the mitochondria. The resulting supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Samples were diluted to obtain a total protein concentration of 0.4 μg/μl, and cytochrome c concentration in each sample was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an R&D systems Quantikine murine cytochrome c immunoassay kit. Cells were seeded on glass cover slips precoated with fetal calf serum and incubated (24 h at 37 °C) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum. Cultures were continued with or without 5 μm lovastatin for an additional 24 h. Mitochondria were stained by exposing cells to 0.5 μg/ml rhodamine 123 dye for 45 min at 37 °C. Medium was changed to PBS immediately before analyzing the staining pattern of the cells. 15 plates of actively proliferating cells in 100-mm dishes were treated with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) for 5 min, harvested by trypsinization, and lysed as described (50Kirito K. Watanabe T. Sawada K. Endo H. Ozawa K. Komatsu N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8329-8337Google Scholar) using 60 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the nuclei pellet was removed. Cytoplasmic extract (1.5 mg measured atA 260) was layered onto a 5-ml, 0.5–1.5m sucrose gradient. The sucrose gradients were centrifuged at 200,000 × g in a Beckman SW50 rotor for 90 min at 4 °C. The gradients were fractionated using an ISCO density gradient fractionator monitoring absorbance at 254 nm. Five 1-ml fractions were collected from each sample into tubes containing 100 μl of 10% SDS. The RNA from each fraction of the sucrose gradient was extracted using Tri-reagent (Sigma) and quantitated. RNA (5 μg) from each fraction was treated with DNase I (DNA-freeTM, Ambion, Austin) according to the manufacturer's directions. cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of each RNA sample with a Taqman reverse transcriptase reagent kit (Applied Biosystems) primed with oligo-dT. Ratbcl-x DNA sequences for upper (5′-GGAGACCCCCAGTGCCATCAAT-3′) and lower (5′-AGTGCCCCGCCAAAGGAGAAA-3′) primers and rat bcl-2 DNA sequences for upper (5′-CACCCCTGGCATCTTCTCCTTCC-3′) and lower (5′-GCATCCCAGCCTCCGTTATCCT-3′) primers were selected using the DNA STAR program (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI), and the resulting sequences were synthesized in the University of Minnesota microchemical facility and purified by HPLC. Real time PCR was performed using a LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The LightCycler PCR protocol consisted of a 10-min denaturation followed by 42 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 68 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 16 s. Reactions were set up as recommended by the manufacturer, optimized with 4 μmMgCl2 with each primer at 1 μm. A portion of the cDNA reaction (9.6 μl) was used for amplification of each gradient fraction. Quantification of mRNA was carried out by comparison (linear interpolation) of the number of cycles to saturation in each sample, with the number of cycles in a concurrently run standard containing a known amount of target mRNA (5 concentrations of the standard were used which spanned the range of values for the samples). Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Total RNA kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA), and 15 μg RNA/lane was electrophoresed through 1% agarose, 2.2 M formaldehyde gel and transferred to nylon filters. A synthetic 40-mer oligonucleotide (5′-GGTGGTCATTCAGGTAGGTGGCCATCCAACTTGCAATCCG-3′), which was designed specifically to recognize bcl-XL (2Rudin C.M. Thompson C.B. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 267-281Google Scholar), was 3′ end-labeled with 50 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was random-primed with 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol). Radiolabeled probes were purified using Sephadex G-25 spin columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hybridization was performed in 50% (v/v) formamide, 5× sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC), 1% SDS, 1× Denhardt's, 10% dextran sulfate, and 250 μg/ml yeast RNA (Sigma) with either the 3′ end-labeled bcl-XLoligonucleotide probe or the random primer-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe at 42 °C overnight. Blots were washed twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 30 min and exposed to x-ray film. RNA stability was quantified as described previously (29Wendt C.H. Towle H. Sharma R. Duvick S. Kawakami K. Gick G. Ingbar D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C356-C364Google Scholar). To assess stability of bcl-x mRNA, cells were treated with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma) for the time intervals specified in the text and figure legends. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blot. REF/Myc cells were stably transfected with a pAPuro vector containing an 800-bp fragment encoding wild type Bcl-XL (a gift from Dr. E. Prochownik, Children's Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA) using the FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) transfection technique. Selection of transfected cells was begun after 24 h in complete medium containing 4 μg/ml puromycin. Resistant clones were isolated after 12–16 days. Phosphorothioate antisense and nonsense DNA oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized and purified by HPLC (Operon Technologies, Inc., Alameda, CA). An 18-mer antisense oligodeoxynucleotide sequence spanning the translation start codon ofbcl-x mRNA and a control scrambled sequence were (a) antisense 5′-CCG GTT GCT CTG AGA CAT-3′ and (b) scramble 5′-CTG AAC GGA GAG ACC CTT-3′. Cells were seeded into chambers of 8-well glass chamber slides overnight and shifted to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal calf serum with or without 5 μm lovastatin, 40 μm oligodeoxynucleotides, or both. Cells were cultivated for 72 h with one media change. Cells were fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol and stained with acridine orange, and apoptosis was quantified using morphological criteria, as described (16Polunovsky V.A. Rosenwald I.B. Tan A.T. White J. Chiang L. Sonenberg N. Bitterman P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6573-6581Google Scholar, 17Tan A. Bitterman P. Sonenberg N. Peterson M. Polunovsky V. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1437-1447Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 103/cm2 in 24-well clusters onto glass cover slips and cultured for 24 h in complete medium. Cultures were either continued in complete medium alone or containing 5 μm lovastatin for 18 or 24 h. Cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. The fixed cells were incubated in blocking buffer (PBS containing 5% normal goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.3% Triton X-100) for 30 min and for an additional 2 h in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% normal goat serum, and 1 μg of anti-cytochrome cantibody (Promega) per ml. Cells were washed 3 times in PBS and incubated for 30 min in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% normal goat serum, and 1 μg of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Sigma) per ml. Cells were rinsed 3 times in PBS, nuclei-stained with DAPI (0.1 mg/ml), and cover slips were mounted onto slides. We previously reported that ectopic expression of eIF4E rescues REF harboring constitutively expressed c-myc (REF/Myc) from apoptosis triggered by either serum restriction (16Polunovsky V.A. Rosenwald I.B. Tan A.T. White J. Chiang L. Sonenberg N. Bitterman P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6573-6581Google Scholar) or cytotoxic stress (17Tan A. Bitterman P. Sonenberg N. Peterson M. Polunovsky V. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1437-1447Google Scholar). To evaluate whether eIF4E also suppresses death receptor-mediated apoptosis, we examined its impact on REF/Myc cell viability after treatment with tumor necrosis factor family ligands. When eIF4E was ectopically overexpressed in REF/Myc cells (REF/Myc/4E), apoptosis was inhibited in response to each apoptotic trigger tested (Fig. 1), indicating that eIF4E promoted suppression of the death receptor-mediated as well as the stress-induced apoptotic cascades. However, the magnitude of kill in response to tumor necrosis factor-α or Fas ligand was modest and not amenable to further study. In contrast, more than 64% of cells underwent apoptotic death in response to lovastatin, a value reduced to nearly the basal frequency by ectopic expression of eIF4E. Based on this result, we restricted our subsequent studies of eIF4E rescue to lovastatin-induced apoptosis. The cleavage of PARP into an 85-kDa daughter fragment is a downstream step common to most forms of apoptosis. We have traced the apoptotic pathway upstream of PARP cleavage in both REF/Myc and REF/Myc/4E cells (Fig. 2). Treatment with lovastatin led to the appearance of the 85-kDa fragment of PARP in REF/Myc cells but not in REF/Myc/4E cells (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, the proform of caspase-3 (32 kDa) was cleaved into its active 17-kDa form in REF/Myc but not in REF/Myc/4E (Fig. 2 B). Consistent with this observation, REF/Myc cells manifested a progressive increase in caspase-3 activation, whereas caspase-3 activity remained low in REF/Myc/4E cells throughout the entire interval of observation (Fig. 2 C). Caspase-9 followed the same pattern. Activation was noted as early as 4 h in REF/Myc cells, reaching levels more than 3-fold that of control by 16 h (Fig. 2 D). In REF/Myc/4E cells caspase-9 remained in the inactive state. Cytochrome c normally resides between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes and is not usually found in the cytoplasm (30Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Google Scholar). Because cytochrome c is required for activation of caspase-9 (31Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Acharya S. Fishel R. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17941-17945Google Scholar), we examined the subcellular distribution of cytochromec after exposure of cells to lovastatin. At base line, cytochrome c was detectable at low levels in the cytoplasm of REF/Myc cells, a value that increased more than 3-fold after 20 h of lovastatin treatment (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, cytochromec remained near basal levels in the cytoplasm of REF/Myc/4E cells after lovastatin treatment, a result corroborated by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3 B). Mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential collapse frequently precedes cytochrome c release and caspase activation (32Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Masse B. Kroemer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 53-57Google Scholar). To examine whether this was the case in our system, we treated cells with lovastatin for 24 h and measured the uptake of rhodamine 123, a cationic fluorophore that enters mitochondria in direct proportion to membrane potential (33Marchetti P. Susin S.A. Decaudin D. Gamen S. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Zamzami N. Naval J. Senik A. Kroemer G. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2033-2038Google Scholar). REF/Myc and REF/Myc/4E cells took up the dye similarly after lovastatin treatment, suggesting that the suppression of cytochrome c release in REF/Myc/4E cells was not due to eIF4E-induced alterations in mitochondrial membrane depolarization (data not shown). Deregulated c-Myc mediates apoptosis in some transformed cell lines by selectively decreasing the mRNA and protein levels of the death antagonists Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL(34Eischen C.M. Woo D. Roussel M.F. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5063-5070Google Scholar, 35Eischen C.M. Packham G. Nip J. Fee B.E. Hiebert S.W. Zambetti G.P. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6983-6993Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether eIF4E had any effect on this interplay between c-Myc and the Bcl-2 family proteins. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that overexpression of eIF4E resulted in a 7-fold increase of Bcl-XL protein in REF/Myc cells without significantly affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2, Bax, or Bad (Fig. 4). To examine whether overexpression of eIF4E increased cellular levels of Bcl-XL protein by direct translational activation, total RNA from REF/Myc and REF/Myc/4E was stratified by sucrose gradient centrifugation to separate translationally active transcripts (more bound ribosomes resulting in more rapid transit through the gradient) from less translationally active transcripts. The resulting fractions were subjected to quantitative PCR analysis for the bcl-XLtranscript, comparing it to the bcl-2 transcript as a control. Examination of the absorbance pattern revealed a bias toward heavier polyribosomes, with an increased proportion of RNA in fractions 4 and 5 in cells ectopically expressing eIF4E (Fig. 5 A). Real time PCR quantification indicated that the transcript for bcl-2 was distributed similarly in REF/Myc and REF/Myc/4E cells, with fraction 2 (the least translationally active) and fraction 5 (the most translationally active) containing similar amounts of transcript (Fig. 5 B). In marked contrast, there was a significant increase in the quantity of bcl-XL mRNA appearing in heavy polyribosomes in REF/Myc/4E cells (Fig. 5 C). The average number of bound ribosomes per bcl-XL transcript in REF/Myc/4E cells was 3.7 compared with 1.5 in REF/Myc cells, indicating a 2.5-fold increase in the rate of bcl-XL mRNA translation initiation (36Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Hersey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Hersey J.W.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 1-31Google Scholar, 37Palmiter R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6779-6787Google Scholar). Thus, one mechanism for the increase in Bcl-XL protein was direct translational activation of its mRNA. A growing number of studies show that eIF4E directly or indirectly participates in a variety of pre-translational stages of protein synthesis including production and processing of mRNA and its nuclear-cytoplasmic transport (38Strudwick S. Borden K.L. Differentiation. 2002; 70: 10-22Google Scholar). To gain insight into the influence of eIF4E on pretranslational events in the synthesis of Bcl-XL, we measured the abundance and stability of its mRNA. Quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated a dramatic effect of eIF4E on steady state levels of bcl-XL mRNA but not on the levels of bcl-2 mRNA (Fig. 6 A). The level ofbcl-XL mRNA was increased nearly 30-fold in REF/Myc/4E cells, a result supported by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 6 B). The kinetics of bcl-XL mRNA degradation were only marginally altered by ectopic eIF4E (half-life of 3 h for REF/Myc and 2.5 h for REF/Myc/4E; Fig. 6 C). These data indicate that in addition to direct translational activation, ectopic eIF4E stimulates synthesis of Bcl-XL by increasing the abundance of its transcript. To assess whether increased expression of Bcl-XL is required for the antiapoptotic function of eIF4E, REF/Myc/4E cells were treated with an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ASO) directed against humanbcl-XL mRNA sequences in the predicted translation initiation region. A scrambled oligonucleotide served as a control. Incubation of cells with the ASO for 72 h significantly reduced the level of Bcl-XL protein, whereas the scrambled oligonucleotide had no effect (Fig. 7 A). Continuation of these cultures for an additional 24 h in the presence of lovastatin led to a significant increase in the apoptotic frequency of ASO compared with the scrambled oligonucleotide control (Fig. 7 B). However, despite reduction of Bcl-XL in REF/Myc/4E by ASO below levels found in REF/Myc, the degree of apoptosis was only half (62.5% in REF/Myc versus 30% in ASO-treated REF/Myc/4E). These data indicate that increased expression of Bcl-XL is necessary for the full-scale antiapoptotic function of ectopic eIF4E and that Bcl-XL is not the sole determinant of eIF4E-mediated rescue from apoptosis. To determine whether increased expression of Bcl-XL could substitute for eIF4E in the rescue of REF/Myc cells from apoptosis, we generated clonal lines of REF/Myc cells stably expressing a range of Bcl-XL protein. Twelve puromycin-resistant clones derived from REF/Myc cells transfected with a pAPuro/bcl-x vector were screened for levels of Bcl-XL expression. Two clonal cell lines were selected for further investigation (Fig. 8 A), one line with a Bcl-XL level that closely matched the level of Bcl-XL expression in REF/Myc/4E cells (clone 7) and a second line in which the level of Bcl-XL was increased more than 5-fold (clone 13).

We now find that quantum bumps in such mutants are reduced approximately 3- to 5-fold but are restored to near wild-type values by mutations in the rdgA gene encoding diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) and also by depleting intracellular ATP. The results demonstrate that amplification requires activation of multiple G protein and PLC molecules, identify DGK as a key enzyme regulating amplification, and implicate diacylglycerol as a messenger of excitation in Drosophila phototransduction."
https://openalex.org/W1971734491,"We used fear conditioning, which is known to alter synaptic efficacy in lateral amygdala (LA), to study molecular mechanisms underlying long-term memory. Following fear conditioning, the tyrosine phosphorylated protein p190 RhoGAP becomes associated with GRB2 in LA significantly more in conditioned than in control rats. RasGAP and Shc were also found to associate with GRB2 in LA significantly more in the conditioned animals. Inhibition of the p190 RhoGAP-downstream kinase ROCK in LA during fear conditioning impaired long- but not short-term memory. Thus, the p190 RhoGAP/ROCK pathway, which regulates the morphology of dendrites and axons during neural development, plays a central role, through a GRB2-mediated molecular complex, in fear memory formation in the lateral amygdala."

We find a robust and specific genetic interaction between capt and Abl at the midline choice point where the growth cone repellent Slit functions to restrict axon crossing. Genetic interactions between capt and slit support a model where Capt and Abl collaborate as part of the repellent response. Further support for this model is provided by genetic interactions that both capt and Abl display with multiple members of the Roundabout receptor family. These studies identify Capulet as part of an emerging pathway linking guidance signals to regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and suggest that the Abl pathway mediates signals downstream of multiple Roundabout receptors."

We found that six pp-GalNAc-Ts, pp-GalNAc-T1, -T2, -T3, -T4, -T6, and -T9, were expressed in B cells, IgA-bearing B cells, and NCI-H929 IgA myeloma cells. pp-GalNAc-T activities of these six enzymes for a synthetic IgA hinge peptide, which has nine possible O-glycosylation sites, were examined using a reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography, a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, and peptide sequencing analysis. pp-GalNAc-T2 showed the strongest activity transferring GalNAc to a maximum of eight positions.

It was reported that the IgA1 hinge region possesses a maximum of five O-glycans, and their amino acid positions have been determined.

O-Glycan is a general term for one of the carbohydrate chains, of which synthesis is initiated by a transfer of GalNAc, xylose, mannose, or fucose to a serine or threonine residue in proteins. In mammalian cells, O-glycans are mostly produced by a transfer of GalNAc through the activity of UDP-N-acetyl-α-d-galactosamine:polypeptideN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (pp-GalNAc-T). 1The abbreviations used are: pp-GalNAc-T, UDP-N-acetyl-α-d-galactosamine:polypeptideN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase; IgA1, immunoglobulin A1; IgAN, IgA nephropathy; RT, reverse transcriptase; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; 5-FAM, 5-carboxyfluorescein; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight; m/z , molecular size; ACTH, adrenocorticoid hormone; PTH, phenylthiohydantoin; HRP, VPSTPPTPSPSTPPTPSPSK-FAM; C1Gal-T, UDP-gal:GalNAc-α-peptide β1,3-galactosyltransferase; ST, sialyltransferase 1The abbreviations used are: pp-GalNAc-T, UDP-N-acetyl-α-d-galactosamine:polypeptideN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase; IgA1, immunoglobulin A1; IgAN, IgA nephropathy; RT, reverse transcriptase; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; 5-FAM, 5-carboxyfluorescein; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight; m/z , molecular size; ACTH, adrenocorticoid hormone; PTH, phenylthiohydantoin; HRP, VPSTPPTPSPSTPPTPSPSK-FAM; C1Gal-T, UDP-gal:GalNAc-α-peptide β1,3-galactosyltransferase; ST, sialyltransferase O-Glycans were found in many glycoproteins, particularly in secretory glycoproteins such as mucins. Eight core structures, core 1–8, that are basal structures initiated by the GalNAc addition to peptides, are recognized in the mucin-type O-glycan. Each core structure is differentially expressed in conjunction with the differentiation and malignant transformation of various cells and tissues (1Brockhausen I. Yang J.M. Burchell J. Whitehouse C. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 607-617Google Scholar, 2Piller F. Piller V. Fox R.I. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15146-15150Google Scholar, 3Fukuda M.

To date, at least 11 human pp-GalNAc-Ts, -T1, -T2, -T3, -T4, -T6, -T7, -T8, -T9, -T10, -T11, and -T12, have been identified (5–16). The proteins are 40–60% identical in their sequence and are therefore homologous. In particular, the predicted catalytic domains are highly conserved. Their substrate specificities have been examined using a variety of peptides, of which sequences are derived from native glycoproteins. They have shown different substrate specificities, different kinetic properties, and different tissue distributions, although some of them showed substantial overlaps in the assessed catalytic specificities and tissue distribution. The positions ofO-glycans in proteins are determined by a variety of pp-GalNAc-Ts expressed in the cells and their substrate specificities. Some pp-GalNAc-Ts exhibit strong “primary activity” toward peptides that have no GalNAc, whereas others, such as pp-GalNAc-T4 and -T7, prefer peptides having GalNAc residue(s) as acceptor substrates rather than the corresponding peptides with no GalNAc (11Bennett E.P.

The “secondary activity,” i.e. GalNAc addition to a peptide already having GalNAc, of the latter may be directed by a lectin domain in their catalytic region. It is supposed that multiple GalNAc transfers to a single peptide are completed in the cells by a combination of multiple pp-GalNAc-Ts having primary activity and ones having secondary activity.Human serum IgA consists of two structurally and functionally distinct subclasses, IgA1 and IgA2, of which the ratio is about 85 and 15% of total IgA, respectively (19Mestecky J. Russell M.W. Monogr. Allergy. 1986; 19: 277-301Google Scholar, 20Mestecky J. Tomana M. Crowley-Nowick P.A. Moldoveanu Z. Julian B.A. Jackson S. Contrib. Nephrol. 1993; 104: 172-182Google Scholar, 21Iwase H. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1999; 11: 113-118Google Scholar). Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), which is the most common form of glomerulonephritis, is a serious disease. In southern Europe, Asia, and Australia, the ratio of IgAN is 20–40% among patients with primary glomerular disease (22Novak J. Julian B.A. Tomana M. Mesteck J. J. Clin. Immunol. 2001; 21: 310-327Google Scholar). Because the method to cure IgAN is still unknown, dialysis treatment or renal transplantation is necessary for IgAN patients in the final stage.IgAN is characterized by the selective deposition of IgA1 in the renal glomerular mesangium (23Conley M.E. Cooper M.D. Michael A.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 1432-1436Google Scholar), although the mechanism for this is unclear. There is some debate regarding the cause of the deposition. Several investigators have proposed that the elevation of the serum IgA1 concentration is the cause of IgAN (24Nomoto Y. Sakai H. Arimori S. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1979; 71: 158-160Google Scholar, 25.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar, 26Casanueva B. Rodriguez-Valverde V. Arias M. Vallo A. Garcia-Fuentes M. Rodriquez-Soriano J. Nephron. 1986; 43: 33-37Google Scholar). To explain why IgA1, but neither IgA2 nor IgG is deposited, it was proposed thatO-glycan structures in the hinge region of IgA1 are profoundly involved in the deposition. IgA1 is characterized by a long extended polyproline structure and distinctive O-glycan side chains in its hinge region (27Torano A. Tsuzukida Y. Liu Y.S. Putnam F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2301-2305Google Scholar, 28Baenziger J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7270-7281Google Scholar). The other immunoglobulins, except for IgA1 and IgD, do not have O-glycans in their hinge regions. Five O-glycans have been identified to attach to the hinge region of IgA1 derived from healthy individuals (28Baenziger J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7270-7281Google Scholar, 29Mattu T.S.

The amino acid positions of the O-glycans attached were determined, and the O-glycan structure was defined to be SAα2–3Galβ1–3GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr (29Mattu T.S. Pleass R.J. Willis A.C. Kilian M.

In this study, we examined, as a first step, which pp-GalNAc-T(s) determine the initiation of O-glycan synthesis among the many members cloned to date.DISCUSSIONIgAN is defined as predominant IgA1 deposits in the renal mesangium (45Berger J. Hinglais N. J. Urol. Nephrol. 1968; 74: 694-695Google Scholar). Although there is some argument regarding the pathogenesis of IgAN, incompleteness of O-glycosylation in the IgA1 hinge region is considered a possible cause of the deposition (20Mestecky J.

Toda Y. Hotta K. Kobayashi Y. Contrib. Nephrol. 1995; 111: 73-84Google Scholar). Unlike IgA2 or IgG, IgA1 has a structurally exceptional hinge portion that comprises a proline-rich sequence and possesses multiple O-glycans. In the past few years, with the progress of MS analysis, capillary electrophoresis and so on, it has been well elucidated that the number of carbohydrate residues in the IgA1 hinge region is reduced in IgAN patients compared with normal controls (47Odani H.

As an initial attempt to answer this question, we identified which pp-GalNAc-T(s) are responsible for the biosynthesis ofO-glycans in the IgA1 hinge region. pp-GalNAc-T2 showed the strongest pp-GalNAc-T activity toward the IgA1 hinge region among all pp-GalNAc-Ts we examined, and transferred GalNAcs to selective Ser/Thr residues that had been identified to be glycosylated in vivo(29Mattu T.S. Pleass R.J. Willis A.C. Kilian M. Wormald M.R. Lellouch A.C. Rudd P.M. Woof J.M. Dwek R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2260-2272Google Scholar). Thus, pp-GalNAc-T2 was determined to be merely responsible for the initiation of O-glycan synthesis in the IgA1 hinge region in this study.Six pp-GalNAc-Ts, pp-GalNAc-T1, -T2, -T3, -T4, -T6, and -T9, were found to be expressed in IgA-positive cells. This expression profile was almost similar to that of the B cells and an IgA myeloma cell line. We examined the specificity and the relative activity of the six enzymes toward a hinge peptide (HRP) that mimicked the human IgA1 hinge region.The retention time of HRP glycosylated by pp-GalNAc-Ts on reversed phase-HPLC became shorter dependent on the number of GalNAcs because of the hydrophilicity. As the number of incorporated GalNAc residues increased, the retention time decreased. In addition, we could separate the reaction products having the same number of GalNAcs dependent on the positions where GalNAc was added, such as P1 versus P2, P4 versus P5, and P7 versus P8.As summarized in Fig. 6, two initial products, P1 and P2, were identified to have a GalNAc at Ser-11 or Thr-7, respectively, followed by the addition at Thr-15 as a secondary reaction. Thr-7 and Thr-15 are typical threonine residues encoded in the mucin box,XTPXP. Thus, the specificity of pp-GalNAc-T2 is somehow in agreement with the mucin box rule (40Yoshida A. Suzuki M. Ikenaga H. Takeuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16884-16888Google Scholar), although Ser-11 is not consistent with the rule. The existence of these two initial products suggested that there are at least two synthetic pathways. The next product from P2 was P3; however, the product derived from P1 was not found, and similarly some products lacked intermediates. These transient products were thought to exist as small peaks that we could not fractionate, and such small transient peaks may be immediately glycosylated to the following product. P5 was considered to be generated from both of the initial products. P4, which has a GalNAc at Thr-12, was produced from P3; however, the products from P4 were not detected until the end of the reaction. P4 may be a dead-end product of the reaction.It has also been reported that the initialO-glycosylation of a peptide substrate influences the subsequent glycosylation, probably due to conformational change of the peptide and the accessibility of pp-GalNAc-Ts for particular acceptor sites (57Kirnarsky L. Nomoto M. Ikematsu Y. Hassan H. Bennett E.P. Cerny R.L. Clausen H. Hollingsworth M.A. Sherman S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12811-12817Google Scholar). There are two consecutive Ser and Thr residues, such as Ser-3/Thr-4 and Ser-11/Thr-12, in HRP. Although one of the consecutive residues was glycosylated, no products in which both consecutive residues were glycosylated were found except for P11. This result indicated that pp-GalNAc-T2 cannot glycosylate the sites next to GalNAc-attached sites within HRP. This phenomenon is consistent with the previous result using a peptide substrate that mimicked the tandem repeat portion of MUC2 (41Iida S. Takeuchi H. Hassan H. Clausen H. Irimura T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 230-234Google Scholar, 58Kato K. Takeuchi H. Miyahara N. Kanoh A. Hassan H. Clausen H. Irimura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 110-115Google Scholar). This is contrast to the activity of pp-GalNAc-T13 which preferentially transfers GalNAc to all three consecutive Ser/Thr residues in a synthetic peptide derived from syndecan-3 (59Zhang Y. Iwasaki H. Wang H. Kudo T. Kalka T.B. Hennet T. Kubota T. Cheng L. Inaba N. Gotoh M. Togayachi A. Guo J. Hisatomi H. Nakajima K. Nishihara S. Nakamura M. Marth J.D. Narimatsu H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2260-2272Google Scholar) analyzed O-glycans in the IgA1 hinge region that was prepared from serum IgA1 of healthy individuals. They indicated that O-glycans were attached at five positions, which correspond to Thr-4, Thr-7, Ser-9, Ser-11, and Thr-15 in our peptide, HRP. Our results indicated that pp-GalNAc-T2 is able to transfer GalNAc residues to almost all possible glycosylation sites in HRP. However, a tremendous amount of the enzyme and a very long incubation were required to glycosylate all such positions. Because a FAM-labeled short peptide was used in this study, the three-dimensional structure might be different from the physiological structure of the IgA1 molecule, and this may influence the enzyme specificities in an artificial manner. The enzyme reaction was performed in vitro; therefore, the acceptor substrate specificity of pp-GalNAc-T2 under in vitro conditions may not necessarily reflect those of pp-GalNAc-T2 in the cells. However, the glycosylated sites of P1 to P7 except for P4 and P6 were not inconsistent with the results obtained by analyzing natural IgA1 derived from human serum (29Mattu T.S. Pleass R.J. Willis A.C. Kilian M. Wormald M.R. Lellouch A.C. Rudd P.M. Woof J.M. Dwek R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2260-2272Google Scholar). Supposing that the pathways up to P7 production reflect thein vivo O-glycosylation, this is consistent with the finding of Mattu et al. (29Mattu T.S. Pleass R.J. Willis A.C. Kilian M. Wormald M.R. Lellouch A.C. Rudd P.M. Woof J.M. Dwek R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2260-2272Google Scholar). P6 is not consistent with the results Mattu et al. (29Mattu T.S. Pleass R.J. Willis A.C. Kilian M. Wormald M.R. Lellouch A.C. Rudd P.M. Woof J.M. Dwek R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2260-2272Google Scholar) because it contained GalNAc at Ser-19; however, Ser-19 may be easily glycosylated because it exists at the end of an artificial peptide and may be difficult to be glycosylated in the hinge region of natural IgA1 molecule.On the other hand, all five pp-GalNAc-Ts other than pp-GalNAc-T2 showed very weak and almost negligible activity toward HRP, and their specificities were totally different from those of pp-GalNAc-T2. In addition, they produced PX as an initial product that was mono-glycosylated at Thr-12. The Thr-12 glycosylation is not consistent with the previous report (29Mattu T.S. Pleass R.J. Willis A.C. Kilian M. Wormald M.R. Lellouch A.C. Rudd P.M. Woof J.M. Dwek R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2260-2272Google Scholar). These pp-GalNAc-Ts probably do not function in physiological O-glycosylation of the IgA1 in the cells.From the above, we concluded that pp-GalNAc-T2 is merely responsible for the initiation of O-glycosylation in the IgA1 hinge region among the 10 pp-GalNAc-Ts that have been reported to date. A single enzyme, pp-GalNAc-T2, can transfer GalNAc to all five positions in the hinge region. This is quite an interesting exception from the general rule of O-glycosylation, because it has been believed that O-glycosylation on a protein is determined by a combination of multiple pp-GalNAc-Ts expressed in the cell. In the case of O-glycosylation for mucins that possess a large number of O-glycans, it is probably true that multiple pp-GalNAc-Ts are involved in the initiation of O-glycan synthesis on a single mucin.The present study is the first report on the elucidation ofO-glycosylation in the IgA1 hinge region. Up-regulation or down-regulation of the pp-GalNAc-T2 activity in the cells may lead to the increase or decrease in the number of O-glycans in IgA1, respectively. Based on the pathways in Fig. 6, we can predict that the decrease of pp-GalNAc-T2 activity will result in the loss ofO-glycan in the order of Thr-4, Ser-9, Thr-15, and Thr-7 or Ser-11. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of incompleteO-glycosylation of IgA1 of IgAN patients, more investigation will be required not only for pp-GalNA-Ts but also for core 1 Gal-T(s) and ST(s). O-Glycan is a general term for one of the carbohydrate chains, of which synthesis is initiated by a transfer of GalNAc, xylose, mannose, or fucose to a serine or threonine residue in proteins. In mammalian cells, O-glycans are mostly produced by a transfer of GalNAc through the activity of UDP-N-acetyl-α-d-galactosamine:polypeptideN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (pp-GalNAc-T). 1The abbreviations used are: pp-GalNAc-T, UDP-N-acetyl-α-d-galactosamine:polypeptideN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase; IgA1, immunoglobulin A1; IgAN, IgA nephropathy; RT, reverse transcriptase; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; 5-FAM, 5-carboxyfluorescein; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight; m/z , molecular size; ACTH, adrenocorticoid hormone; PTH, phenylthiohydantoin; HRP, VPSTPPTPSPSTPPTPSPSK-FAM; C1Gal-T, UDP-gal:GalNAc-α-peptide β1,3-galactosyltransferase; ST, sialyltransferase 1The abbreviations used are: pp-GalNAc-T, UDP-N-acetyl-α-d-galactosamine:polypeptideN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase; IgA1, immunoglobulin A1; IgAN, IgA nephropathy; RT, reverse transcriptase; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; 5-FAM, 5-carboxyfluorescein; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight; m/z , molecular size; ACTH, adrenocorticoid hormone; PTH, phenylthiohydantoin; HRP, VPSTPPTPSPSTPPTPSPSK-FAM; C1Gal-T, UDP-gal:GalNAc-α-peptide β1,3-galactosyltransferase; ST, sialyltransferase O-Glycans were found in many glycoproteins, particularly in secretory glycoproteins such as mucins. Eight core structures, core 1–8, that are basal structures initiated by the GalNAc addition to peptides, are recognized in the mucin-type O-glycan. Each core structure is differentially expressed in conjunction with the differentiation and malignant transformation of various cells and tissues (1Brockhausen I. Yang J.M. Burchell J. Whitehouse C.

To date, at least 11 human pp-GalNAc-Ts, -T1, -T2, -T3, -T4, -T6, -T7, -T8, -T9, -T10, -T11, and -T12, have been identified (5–16). The proteins are 40–60% identical in their sequence and are therefore homologous. In particular, the predicted catalytic domains are highly conserved. Their substrate specificities have been examined using a variety of peptides, of which sequences are derived from native glycoproteins. They have shown different substrate specificities, different kinetic properties, and different tissue distributions, although some of them showed substantial overlaps in the assessed catalytic specificities and tissue distribution. The positions ofO-glycans in proteins are determined by a variety of pp-GalNAc-Ts expressed in the cells and their substrate specificities. Some pp-GalNAc-Ts exhibit strong “primary activity” toward peptides that have no GalNAc, whereas others, such as pp-GalNAc-T4 and -T7, prefer peptides having GalNAc residue(s) as acceptor substrates rather than the corresponding peptides with no GalNAc (11Bennett E.P.

The “secondary activity,” i.e. GalNAc addition to a peptide already having GalNAc, of the latter may be directed by a lectin domain in their catalytic region. It is supposed that multiple GalNAc transfers to a single peptide are completed in the cells by a combination of multiple pp-GalNAc-Ts having primary activity and ones having secondary activity. Human serum IgA consists of two structurally and functionally distinct subclasses, IgA1 and IgA2, of which the ratio is about 85 and 15% of total IgA, respectively (19Mestecky J. Russell M.W. Monogr.

Pharmacol. 1989; 97: 1125-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Brock J.A. Cunnane T.C. Neuroscience. 1992; 47: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Membrane potentials were recorded through a headstage connected to an Axoclamp-2A amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA) in bridge mode and stored on a digital audio tape using a digital tape recorder (DTR-1204, BioLogic Science Instruments, Claix, France). Evoked events were digitized at 5–10 kHz and transferred to a computer using an analogue-to-digital converter (Digidata 1200A interface) and Axotape software (Axon Instruments Inc.). The amplitude, frequency, rise time, and latency of evoked and spontaneous events were analyzed using Axograph 2 (Axon Instruments Inc.). The mean resting membrane potential of the submandibular ganglion neurons was −63.8 ± 0.6 mV (n = 52). The mean base line was determined by averaging the initial part of the digitized signal between the stimulus artifact and the onset of the response. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E., and n values refer to the number of preparations. Data were analyzed statistically using Student's pairedt test with the level of significance being taken asp < 0.05. Capped RNA transcripts encoding full-length rat α1B and β3 (a gift of D. Lipscombe, Brown University) and rabbit α1C and α2δ (a gift of G. Zamponi, University of Calgary) were synthesized using a mMESSAGE mMachine in vitro transcription kit (Ambion). Xenopus laevis stage V–VI oocytes were removed and treated with collagenase (Sigma type I) for defolliculation. For N- or L-type Ca2+ channel expression, the oocytes were then injected with cRNA mixtures of either α1B (2.5 ng/cell) or α1C (5 ng/cell) in combination with α2δ and β3 in the ratio of 1:1:1 or 1:2.5:1, respectively. For R-type Ca2+channels, cDNA for rat α1E (4.5 ng/cell) (a gift of G. Zamponi, University of Calgary) was injected intranuclearly in combination with the cRNA injection of α2δ and β3 (2.5 ng/cell each). The oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in ND96 solution (in mm): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, 5 pyruvic acid, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin, pH 7.5, prior to recording. 3–8 days after cRNA/cDNA injection, whole cell Ca2+ channel currents were recorded from oocytes using the two-electrode (virtual ground circuit) voltage clamp technique. Microelectrodes were filled with 3m KCl and typically had resistances of 0.3−1.5 megohms. All recordings were made at room temperature (20−23 °C) using bath solution containing the following components (in mm): 5 BaCl2, 85 tetraethylammonium hydroxide, 5 KCl, and 5 HEPES titrated to pH 7.4 with methansulfonic acid. During recording, oocytes were perfused continuously at a rate of ∼1.5 ml/min. The activation of Cl− current by Ba2+ influx through the Ca2+ channel was eliminated by injecting 50 nl of 50 mm BAPTA-Na4 at least 15 min prior to recording. Using a GeneClamp 500B amplifier and pCLAMP 8 software (Axon Instruments Inc.), data were acquired at 10 kHz after low pass filtration at 1 kHz and leak-subtracted on-line using a P/4 protocol and analyzed. Currents were evoked with 100-ms depolarizing pulses to 0 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV at 20-s intervals. Peak current was measured before and during the perfusion of ω-conotoxins and antagonists for up to 10 min. Preparation of rat brain membrane and [125I]GVIA and radioligand displacement protocols were as described previously (9Lewis R.J. Nielsen K.J. Craik D.J. Loughnan M.L. Adams D.A. Sharpe I.A.

Alewood P.F. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B.H. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Starting from methylbenzhydrylamine HCl resin (0.5-mmol scale), 4 eq of Boc-protected amino acids were coupled to the growing chain using 4 eq of 0.5 m HBTU inN′,N′-dimethylformamide and 5 eq ofN,N-diisopropylethylamine. The side chain protection chosen was Arg(Tos), Asp(OcHex), Lys(CIZ), Thr(Bzl), Tyr(BrZ), Ser(Bzl), and Cys(p-MeBzl). The chain assembly was monitored after each step by the quantitative ninhydrin method and double-coupled when coupling yields were <99.7%. The capping of the remaining amino groups by acetylation was performed using acetic anhydride inN′,N′-dimethylformamide (87 μl/ml). After assembly, side chain-protecting groups were removed and the peptide was concurrently cleaved from the resin using anhydrous hydrogen fluoride/p-cresol/p-thiocresol (18:1:1). The peptides were purified and oxidized as described previously (15Nielsen K.J. Adams D.A. Thomas L. Bond T.J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1405-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Mass spectra were measured on a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems) equipped with an electrospray atmospheric pressure ionization (ESI) source. Boc-l-amino acids were obtained from Auspep (Melbourne, Australia). Methylbenzhydrylamine HCl (0.79 mmol/g) was obtained from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). HBTU was obtained from Richelieu Biotechnologies (Quebec, Canada). Trifluoroacetic acid, N′,N′-dimethylformamide, and N,N-diisopropylethylamine were of peptide synthesis grade and purchased from Auspep. Acetonitrile and methanol (Hypersolve Far-UV grade) were from BDH (Poole, United Kingdom). Hydrogen fluoride was supplied by Boc Gases (Brisbane, Australia). All other chemicals were of analytical grade from commercial suppliers. All NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ARX 500 spectrometer equipped with az-gradient unit or on a Bruker DMX 750 spectrometer equipped with a x,y,z-gradient unit. Peptide concentrations were ∼2 mm. Hα chemical shifts for the native peptides and the two analogues were obtained from spectra recorded in 95% H2O, 5% D2O, pH 3.0–3.5, at 293 K. Restraints for three-dimensional structure calculations were obtained from spectra recorded at 293 K with additional experiments run at 280 K to resolve overlapping signal (15Nielsen K.J. Adams D.A.

Secondary Hα chemical shifts were analyzed compared with the random coil shift values of Wishart et al.(20Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyason H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D.

Drugs were dissolved in the Krebs phosphate solution perfusing the preparation, and the effects were evaluated after they reached equilibrium (≥20 min). The dose-response relations were determined for ω-conotoxins, whereas other drugs were bath-applied at a maximally effective concentration. In addition to the synthesized ω-conotoxins, we tested ω-agatoxin IVA, ω-conotoxin GVIA, ω-conotoxin MVIIC (Alamone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel), SNX-482 (Peptide Institute Inc., Osaka, Japan), cadmium chloride, hexamethonium, mecamylamine, nifedipine, and tetrodotoxin (Sigma). ω-Grammotoxin SIA was a kind gift from Dr. Rick Lampe (Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, DE). Stimulation of the lingual nerve with trains of stimuli (0.1–10 Hz, 4–50 V, pulse-width 0.05–0.25 ms) evoked EPSPs, which could initiate action potentials in the cell bodies of the postsynaptic neurons of the rat submandibular ganglion. The postganglionic neurons have been classified into three types by their responses to these trains of stimuli (8Smith A.B. Motin L. Lavidis N.A. Adams D.J. Neuroscience. 2000; 95: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this study, neurons in which supramaximal stimulation of the preganglionic nerve fibers at 0.1 Hz either evoked a suprathreshold EPSP and action potential in response to every stimulus (strong input synapse, ≥50% of total number of neurons) (Fig. 1 A) or where the EPSP does not usually reach threshold for the initiation of an action potential (weak input synapse, ∼ 25% of neurons studied) were used. EPSPs recorded from neurons receiving either strong or weak inputs were abolished by hexamethonium (100 μm) and mecamylamine (10 μm) indicating that EPSPs were mediated by acetylcholine acting at nicotinic receptors. ω-Conotoxin CVID produced a reversible and concentration-dependent inhibition of EPSPs (Fig. 1). Control EPSPs from both strong and weak input neurons had a mean amplitude of 26.2 ± 2.5 mV, and 20 min after bath application of CVID (100 nm), these EPSPs were reduced by 66% to a mean amplitude of 9.1 ± 1.1 mV (n = 13). The IC50 for inhibition of the CVID-sensitive component (79 ± 8% of peak amplitude) was 32 nm (pIC50 7.5 ± 0.15). CVID had no detectable effect on the resting membrane potential of individual ganglion cells or on the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous EPSPs (n = 5) (Fig. 1, inset), suggesting that it acted presynaptically to inhibit neurally evoked transmitter release. To confirm that Tyr-13 in loop 2 contributes significantly to the ability of CVID to inhibit transmitter release, we assessed the potency of the phenylalanine analogue of CVID on transmitter release. [Y13F]CVID (0.1–1 μm) was without effect on the EPSPs (n = 3). The effect of CVID contrasts with the effects of 300 nmω-conotoxin GVIA (N-type), 100 nm ω-agatoxin IVA, 300 nm ω-conotoxin MVIIC (P/Q-type), 300 nmω-grammotoxin SIA, 300 nm SNX-482 (R-type), and 30 μm nifedipine (L-type), which had little or no inhibitory effect on evoked and spontaneous transmitter release in rat submandibular ganglia either alone or in combination with each other (n = 3–13 per drug) (Fig. 1 D), confirming previous results (8Smith A.B. Motin L. Lavidis N.A. Adams D.J. Neuroscience. 2000; 95: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In a proportion of weak input neurons, GVIA inhibited EPSPs by up to 12% of the control amplitude (5 of 8 preparations) (Fig. 1 D) with an IC50 of 60 nm, suggesting that GVIA-sensitive calcium channels play a minor role in neurotransmission in the rat submandibular ganglia. GVIA had no effect on strong input neurons (n = 4). EPSPs were consistently abolished by low concentrations of the nonspecific calcium channel blocker Cd2+ (30 μm,n = 8), indicating that neurally evoked transmitter release from preganglionic neurons was dependent on calcium influx through VSCCs. Of the characterized ω-conotoxins, CVID most closely resembles MVIIA in structure. Despite this structural similarity, MVIIA (10–1000 nm) failed to produce detectable inhibition of EPSPs (n = 4) (Fig. 2 B). Since loop 2 contributes mostly to ω-conotoxin potency at N-type VSCCs, we investigated the influence of a Lys/Arg swap at position 10 in CVID and MVIIA on their ability to block neurotransmitter release. Bath application of a maximally effective concentration of [K10R]CVID (100 nm) produced only 19% inhibition of EPSPs (Fig. 2 A), reducing control EPSPs of 27.6 ± 2.9 mV to 22.4 ± 2.2 mV after 20 min (n = 8). In contrast to the ineffective MVIIA, [R10K]MVIIA caused a 47% inhibition of EPSP amplitude (Fig. 2 C), reducing control EPSPs from 27.0 ± 2.4 mV to 14.4 ± 2.2 mV after 20 min (n = 6). [R10K]MVIIA had no detectable effect on the membrane potential of individual ganglion neurons or on the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous EPSPs (data not shown), suggesting that similar to CVID, it acted presynaptically to inhibit evoked neurotransmitter release. The effects of ω-conotoxin GVIA (100 nm), ω-agatoxin IVA (100 nm), ω-conotoxin MVIIC (100 nm), ω-grammotoxin SIA (100 nm), SNX-482 (100 nm), and nifedipine (10 μm) were also investigated on the CVID-resistant transmitter release. These toxins, applied alone or in combination with each other, had no detectable effects on the transmitter release recorded in the presence of 100 nm CVID (n = 3 for each toxin). The affinity of ω-conotoxins CVID, MVIIA, and their analogues for N-type VSCCs was determined from their ability to displace [125I]GVIA from rat brain membrane. The pIC50 values are shown in TableI. [K10R]CVID and [R10K]MVIIA had potencies that were comparable with the native peptides. However, [Y13F]CVID was significantly less potent than CVID, confirming that the hydroxyl group in Tyr-13 of CVID has a similar influence on binding to the N-type VSCC as seen previously for the Y13F analogues of GVIA and MVIIA (25Nielsen K.J.

The effect of ω-conotoxins CVID and MVIIA were examined on L-, N-, and R-type Ca2+ channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Whole cell Ca2+channel currents were recorded from oocytes injected with either rat cRNA or cDNA for α1B, α1C, or α1E in combination with α2δ and β3 using 5 mm Ba2+ as the charge carrier. Bath application of either ω-conotoxins CVID or MVIIA (300 nm) inhibited the depolarization-activated inward Ba2+ current recorded from oocytes expressing N-type but had no effect on current through L- or R-type Ca2+ channels (see Table II) (29Stea A.

Hα chemical shifts relative to random coil values are a sensitive measurement of backbone conformation for disulfide-bonded isomers and can be used to locate local conformational differences across structurally related peptides (25Nielsen K.J. Schroeder T. Lewis R. J. Mol. Recognit. 2000; 13: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 26Gehrmann J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Hα chemical shifts were similar for [K10R]CVID and [R10K]MVIIA compared with the native peptides CVID and MVIIA (Fig. 3 A), indicating that any global structural changes on swapping residue 10 are minimal. The three-dimensional structure of [R10K]MVIIA differed from MVIIA by a root mean square deviation of 0.461 across the heavy backbone atoms, confirming the absence of any significant structural change. This is seen in the ribbon diagram showing the superimposition of the 17 lowest energy conformations and the orientation of Tyr-13 and Lys/Arg-10 for CVID, MVIIA, and [R10K]MVIIA (Fig. 3 B). To determine whether the difference in selectivity might arise from difference surface exposure at position 10, we calculated the solvent-accessible surface area for residue 10 over the 17–20 lowest energy conformations in Insight II. The rank order of the solvent-accessible surface area was MVIIA > [R10K]MVIIA > CVID (156 ± 8.0, 147 ± 8.1, and 92 ± 4.6 Å2, respectively). A complete three-dimensional structure was not calculated for [K10R]CVID, because it had the same potency at the N-type VSCC and conserved Hα chemical shift differences compared with CVID especially across loop 2 (Fig. 3 A). Neurotransmitter release from the preganglionic cholinergic neurons innervating the rat submandibular ganglia is resistant to inhibition by commonly used selective antagonists of N-, L-, P/Q-, R-, and T-type calcium channels (8Smith A.B. Motin L. Lavidis N.A. Adams D.J. Neuroscience. 2000; 95: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Seabrook G.R. Adams D.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 97: 1125-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the recently identified ω-conotoxin CVID, the most selective N-type versus P/Q-type VSCC blocker, on transmitter release from these nerve terminals. CVID (IC50= 32 nm) produced up to 80% inhibition of nerve-evoked transmitter release without affecting spontaneous transmitter release, and this inhibition was reversed upon washout. In contrast, nerve-evoked transmitter release was unaffected by MVIIA (≤1 μm). Interestingly, the potency of CVID to inhibit transmitter release from preganglionic cholinergic neurons was similar to the potency of both CVID and MVIIA to inhibit N-type VSCCs in postganglionic sympathetic neurons of rat vas deferens (9Lewis R.J. Nielsen K.J. Craik D.J. Loughnan M.L. Adams D.A. Sharpe I.A. Luchian T. Adams D.J. Bond T. Thomas L. Jones A. Matheson J.-L. Drinkwater R. Andrews P.R. Alewood P.F. J. Biol.

Loop 2 of ω-conotoxins has been identified as the primary loop involved in binding to the N-type VSCC (11Kim J.I. Takahashi M. Ogura A. Kohno T. Kudo Y. Sato K. J. Biol.

Recognit. 2000; 13: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with the hydroxyl group on Tyr-13 on both ω-conotoxin GVIA and MVIIA found to be a critical determinant of high interaction at the N-type VSCC (12Kim J.I. Takahashi M. Ohtake A. Wakamiya A. Sato K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27Nadasdi L. Yamashiro D. Chung D. Tarczy-Hornoch K. Adriaensesens P. Ramachandran J. Nadasdi L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8076-8081Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The 400-fold reduction in potency of [Y13F]CVID for rat brain N-type VSCC confirmed a key role of Tyr-13 in CVID. [Y13F]CVID was also inactive on the EPSPs, indicating that N-type and CVID-sensitive VSCCs both require the hydroxyl of Tyr-13. One possible conclusion from this result is that CVID may bind to both VSCCs in a similar manner. Because loop 2 of MVIIA and CVID vary only at position 10 (Lys or Arg, respectively) (see Table. 1), we investigated the role of this position contributing to the selectivity differences observed between MVIIA and CVID by swapping these residues. [K10R]CVID (100 nm) produced significantly less (< 20%) inhibition of transmitter release than CVID, indicating that Lys-10 was the preferred residue for resistant-type VSCC inhibition by CVID. Supporting this conclusion, Lys-10 was found to markedly enhance MVIIA inhibition of resistant-type VSCCs with the [R10K]MVIIA (100 nm) causing 47% inhibition of evoked transmitter release (i.e. >100-fold more than MVIIA). None of the ω-conotoxins investigated affected spontaneous transmitter release or the resting membrane potential of the postsynaptic cell, indicating a selective action at presynaptic VSCCs. The effects of the L-, N-, P/Q-, and R-type VSCC antagonists (nifedipine, ω-conotoxin GVIA, ω-conotoxin MVIIC, ω-agatoxin IVA, ω-grammotoxin SIA, and SNX-482) were investigated on the transmitter release remaining after the application of CVID. None of these VSCC inhibitors, either applied alone or in combination, had any effect on the CVID-resistant neurotransmitter release. However, the CVID-resistant release was reversibly abolished by Cd2+, indicating its dependence on calcium entry into nerve terminals through VSCCs. Because the R-type VSCC inhibitors used do not inhibit all R-type VSCCs (28Bourinet E. Stotz S.C. Spaetgens R.L. Dayanithi G. Lemos J. Nargeot J. Zamponi G.W. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), we investigated the effects of ω-conotoxins CVID and MVIIA on current flow-through cloned L- or R-type calcium channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Both CVID and MVIIA had no effect on depolarization-activated Ba2+currents through L- or R-type calcium channels but potently inhibited current through N-type VSCCs (see Table II) as reported previously (9Lewis R.J.

In an attempt to understand the structural basis of the selectivity differences between ω-conotoxin MVIIA and [R10K]MVIIA at the CVID-sensitive VSCCs, we determined their secondary and tertiary structures by 1H NMR. From these studies, it was evident that residue replacements at position 10 had little effect on the global fold or structure of CVID or MVIIA. However, examining the solvent-accessible surface area at position 10 revealed a trend of decreasing surface area that correlated with activity at the CVID-sensitive VSCCs in preganglionic neurons. It is possible that the degree of exposure may influence the selectivity of ω-conotoxins with the most exposed residue, Arg in MVIIA, creating a clash that precludes binding to certain VSCCs. Recently, Feng et al. (37Feng Z.P. Hamid J. Doering C. Bosey G.M. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15728-15735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) identified that a single residue change on an extracellular loop of the N-type VSCC (G1326) can influence ω-conotoxin access. Thus, relatively small differences in N-type VSCC sequence may significantly alter ω-conotoxin affinity, raising to the possibility that the VSCC targeted by CVID in preganglionic nerve terminals may be a N-type (Cav2.2) calcium channel variant that does not bind all ω-conotoxins. Two functionally distinct variants of the α1B subunit, α1B-b and α1B-d, of the N-type calcium channel that differ at two loci (four amino acids (SFMG) in IIIS3–S4 and two amino acids (Glu/Thr) in IVS3–S4) have been shown to be reciprocally expressed in rat brain and sympathetic ganglia (38Lin Z. Haus S. Edgerton J. Lipscombe D. Neuron. 1997; 18: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The selective expression of pharmacologically distinct VSCC splice variants of α1B subunits in different regions of the nervous system is proposed to underlie the differential block of preganglionic nerve terminal VSCCs by N-type selective ω-conotoxins. Alternative splicing of the domain II–III linker region of the human N-type (Cav2.2) calcium channel α1B subunit has recently been shown to differentially affect ω-conotoxin MVIIA and GVIA block of the calcium channel current (39Kaneko S.

In conclusion, CVID was found to be a potent inhibitor of the pharmacologically distinct VSCC controlling a major component of transmitter release in preganglionic cholinergic nerve terminals. CVID may help to define the nature and role of this VSCC. Position 10 appears to play a key role in influencing ω-conotoxin affinity for this N-type-related VSCC. Given that [125I]CVID labels fewer sites in rat brain than [125I]MVIIA (9Lewis R.J. Nielsen K.J. Craik D.J. Loughnan M.L. Adams D.A. Sharpe I.A. Luchian T. Adams D.J. Bond T. Thomas L. Jones A.

Because parasympathetic nerves arise from spinal cord neurons, it is possible that CVID-sensitive VSCCs are also expressed and play a role in neurotransmission in the spinal cord.

https://openalex.org/W2325553200,"The roles played by the endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) in the early stages of multi-step carcinogenesis and in the control of hematogenous versus lymphatic metastasis are unknown. To investigate these issues we compared tumor development in normal mice and in transgenic mice with targeted overexpression of TSP-1 in the epidermis following a standard two-step chemical skin carcinogenesis regimen. Overexpression of TSP-1 resulted in delayed and reduced development of premalignant epithelial hyperplasias, but did not inhibit the malignant conversion to squamous cell carcinomas. TSP-1 overexpression also suppressed tumor angiogenesis and distant organ metastasis, but failed to inhibit tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis or lymphatic tumor spread to regional lymph nodes. Concomitant with these results, we found that the endothelial TSP-1 receptor CD36 was mostly absent from cutaneous lymphatic vessels. Our findings indicate the potential use of TSP-1 for the prevention of premalignant stages of tumorigenesis and are likely to have implications for the further development of anti-angiogenic cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2097696559,"It is widely acknowledged that movements are planned at the level of the kinematics. However, the central nervous system must ultimately transform kinematic plans into dynamics-related commands. How, when, and where the kinematics-to-dynamics (KD) transformation is processed represent fundamental and unanswered questions. We recorded from the supplementary motor area (SMA) of two monkeys as they executed visually instructed reaching movements. We specifically analyzed a delay period following the instruction but prior to the go signal (motor planning). During the delay, a group of neurons in the SMA progressively came to reflect the dynamics rather than the desired kinematics of the upcoming movement. This finding suggests that some neurons in the SMA participate in the KD transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2091657068,"In the vertebrate brain, the thalamus serves as a relay and integration station for diverse neuronal information en route from the periphery to the cortex. Formation of the thalamocortical tract occurs during pre- and postnatal development, with distinct thalamic nuclei projecting to specific cortical regions. The molecular forces that underlie the invasion by axons into specific cortical layers followed by activity-dependent maturation of synapses are poorly understood. We show that genetic ablation of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) in the mouse neocortex results in reduction of a set of anatomically distinct axonal bundles projecting from thalamus through cortical white matter. These bundles include thalamocortical axons that normally establish connections with retrosplenial and visual cortex, sites of early postnatal NT-3 expression. These results implicate neurotrophins in the critical stage of precise thalamocortical connections."

The pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway in baby hamster kidney cells, synchronized by serum deprivation, was found to be up-regulated 1.9-fold during S phase and subsequently down-regulated as the cells progressed through the cycle. The nucleotide pools were depleted by serum starvation and were not replenished during the first round of cell division, suggesting that the rate of utilization of the newly synthesized nucleotides closely matched their rate of formation.

As the culture approached S-phase there was an increased sensitivity to the allosteric activator, 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate, and a loss of UTP inhibition, changes that were reversed when cells emerged from S phase. The allosteric regulation of CAD is known to be modulated by MAP kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylations as well as by autophosphorylation. CAD was found to be fully autophosphorylated in the synchronized cells, but the level remained invariant throughout the cycle. Although the MAPK activity increased early in G1, the phosphorylation of the CAD MAPK site was delayed until just before the onset of S phase, probably due to antagonistic phosphorylation by PKA that persisted until late G1. Once activated, pyrimidine biosynthesis remained elevated until rephosphorylation of CAD by PKA and dephosphorylation of the CAD MAPK site late in S phase.

Thus, the de novo biosynthetic pathway plays a dominant role in providing precursors for the synthesis of DNA that accompanies cell division. Furthermore, there is strong evidence (7Weber G.

UTP, an end product of the pathway, is a feedback inhibitor, whereas 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), a substrate for both the parallel de novo purine biosynthetic pathway and a subsequent step in pyrimidine biosynthesis, is an activator (13Tatibana M. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 5903-5913Google Scholar, 25Hager S.E. Jones M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5667-5673Google Scholar,26Levine R.L. Hoogenraad N.J. Kretchmer N.

Trans. 1993; 21: 191-195Google Scholar) made the important observation that purified CAD is phosphorylated at two sites (Fig. 1) by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylation has no effect on the catalytic activity but decreases UTP inhibition, a modification that would be expected to stimulate pyrimidine biosynthesis. However, subsequent studies (32Sahay N. Guy H.I. Xin L. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31195-31202Google Scholar) showed that PKA phosphorylation resulted in a decrease in the affinity for the activator, PRPP, an effect that would be expected to down-regulate the pathway. Thus, PKA phosphorylation alone cannot account for the activation of the pathway in rapidly growing cells.MAP kinases (33Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Google Scholar) are ubiquitous components of the mitogen-activated cascade that result in cellular proliferation in response to growth factors. Stimulation of quiescent cells with epidermal growth factor results in the activation of the MAP kinase cascade and the phosphorylation of Thr-456 in the A1 subdomain (Fig. 1) of the CAD CPSase (34Graves L.M. Guy H.I. Kozlowski P. Huang M. Lazarowski E. Pope R.M. Collins M.A. Dahlstrand E.N. Earp III, H.S. Evans D.R. Nature. 2000; 403: 328-332Google Scholar). MAP kinase phosphorylation both in vivo andin vitro has no effect on any of the catalytic activities of CAD but relieves UTP inhibition and stimulates PRPP activation of the CPSase. Both of these changes in allosteric regulation would be expected to increase the rate of pyrimidine biosynthesis.We have recently shown (18Sigoillot F.D. Evans D.R. Guy H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15745-15751Google Scholar) that the activation of pyrimidine biosynthesis in exponentially growing BHK 165-23 cells is a consequence of the MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of CAD and that its subsequent down-regulation as the culture became confluent is associated with dephosphorylation of the MAP kinase site and phosphorylation by PKA. To more precisely define the mechanism of growth-related activation and down-regulation of pyrimidine biosynthesis, the activity of the pathway and the role of the diverse control mechanisms was examined as BHK 165-23 cells traversed the cell cycle.DISCUSSIONThe results reported here are in agreement with previous studies of synchronously growing cells showing that the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway is activated just before S phase and subsequently down-regulated at the transition between S and G2 (Fig. 8). We found that the rate increased 1.9-fold from 1.0 pmol/min/106 cells in G1 to 1.85 pmol/min/106 cells in mid-S phase. These rates are in good agreement with the rate of pyrimidine biosynthesis of 0.5 pmol/min/106 cells measured in asynchronous cultures of the same cells during the first 24 h after passage but are significantly lower than the rate of 4.2 pmol/min/106 cells measured in fully established, exponentially growing cells (18Sigoillot F.D. Evans D.R. Guy H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15745-15751Google Scholar). The lower rate of pyrimidine biosynthesis after serum starvation can probably be attributed to the low intracellular concentration of the CPSase substrate, ATP.Figure 8Cell cycle progression. A schematic representation of the timing of the events measured during the course of the BHK cell cycle. ppRB, hyperphosphorylated retinoblastoma protein; -P, phosphorylated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The average values for the intracellular nucleotide triphosphates in mammalian cells, compiled by Traut in an exhaustive literature search (50Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Google Scholar), were found to be 567 ± 460, 278 ± 242, 3152 ± 1698, and 468 ± 224 μm for UTP, CTP, ATP, and GTP, respectively. The nucleotide triphosphate concentrations, measured by HPLC analysis of extracts of exponentially growing BHK cells (Table I), were for the most part within the expected range. It is noteworthy, that the nucleotide concentrations after stimulation of serum-deprived cells were appreciably lower that the values in exponentially growing cultures. Moreover, the nucleotide pools did not appreciably expand during the course of the cell cycle. Only modest increases were observed even after 20 h of post-serum stimulation (Table I). These results suggest that 1) the increased rate of pyrimidine biosynthesis nearly matches the rate of utilization of nucleotides for the synthesis of macromolecules during the S phase of the cell cycle, and 2) several cycles of cell division are apparently required before the nucleotide pools can be fully replenished after serum starvation. ATP, for example, was found to be 0.6 mm in serum-starved cells compared with a value of 2.9 mm obtained in fully established cultures. The low ATP concentration would be expected to result in an ∼5-fold decrease 3The CPSase activity in the cell was calculated at the ATP concentrations of 0.4 and 2.9 mm using the Hill equation assuming a K m of 3.4 mm and a Hill coefficient of 1.3, values measured (41Sigoillot F.D. Evans D.R. Guy H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24809-24817Google Scholar) for purified CAD in the absence of allosteric effectors. Because the kinetic parameters are dependent on the concentration of effectors, the calculation is only approximate. in CPSase activity in serum-starved cells, in reasonable agreement with the 7-fold decrease in the flux through the pyrimidine pathway compared with the rate in exponential cultures.As described above, the increase in pyrimidine biosynthesis during the S-phase of the cell cycle cannot be attributed to an increase in the CPSase activity measured in the absence of allosteric effectors or to autophosphorylation of CAD. The CAD autophosphorylation site was nearly completely phosphorylated in vivo, representing a constant phosphothreonine background throughout the cell cycle. However, previous studies show (18Sigoillot F.D. Evans D.R. Guy H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15745-15751Google Scholar) that the CPSase activity of CAD, and consequently the rate of pyrimidine biosynthesis, is controlled by PKA- and MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the CAD CPSase domain.The activity of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway was up-regulated as the cells entered the S phase, reached a maximum at 11 h, and then decreased as the cells exited the S phase. The increase in the pyrimidine biosynthetic activity during S phase closely paralleled the response of CPSase to allosteric effectors. During S phase, UTP inhibition was abolished, and PRPP activation increased 2-fold. This altered response to allosteric effectors could readily account for the 1.9-fold activation of the pathway.Similar changes in allosteric regulation have been observed in asynchronous cultures in response to MAP kinase phosphorylation (18Sigoillot F.D. Evans D.R. Guy H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15745-15751Google Scholar). In synchronized BHK cells, the MAP kinase activity increased rapidly and peaked at 5 h but remained elevated for the duration of the cycle. However, the phosphorylation of the MAP kinase site of CAD did not correlate with the highest MAP kinase activities, and no significant phosphorylation of this site could be detected for 7 h. The resistance of CAD to MAP kinase phosphorylation can probably be attributed to PKA phosphorylation since we have found 4D. H. Kotsis, M. Sigoillot, H. I. Guy, and D. Evans, unpublished results. that prior phosphorylation of CAD by PKA blocks phosphorylation by MAP kinase. CAD serine phosphorylation closely paralleled the activity of PKA, highest initially after serum stimulation and decreasing during the next 7 h. A decrease in PKA activity has been previously shown to be a prerequisite for entry into S phase (44Feliciello A. Gallo A. Mele E. Porcellini A. Troncone G. Garbi C. Gottesman M. Avvedimento E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 303-311Google Scholar). These results suggest that the activating MAP kinase phosphorylation of CAD is delayed until the PKA site is dephosphorylated. Another factor that could potentially influence the phosphorylation of CAD may be its intracellular location relative to the kinases. MAP kinase was found by fluorescence microscopy to be distributed throughout the cell but was concentrated in the nucleus during G1 and S. In contrast, PKA was initially localized in the nucleus but is translocated into the cytosol late in G1. CAD was cytosolic during G1 and migrated into the nucleus, where there were high levels of MAP kinase and low levels of PKA during S phase. Experiments are currently under way to follow up on these interesting observations.The down-regulation of the pathway occurred as cells emerged from the S phase at about 14–15 h post-serum stimulation. At this point, the MAP kinase activity remained elevated, and the CAD MAP kinase site began to dephosphorylate. Moreover, at 15 h the phosphorylation of CAD by PKA began to increase once again. PKA phosphorylation is known to reduce the sensitivity of CAD to PRPP activation (32Sahay N. Guy H.I. Xin L. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31195-31202Google Scholar). Accordingly, a 1.7-fold decrease in the response to PRPP was observed (Fig. 5) as the cells exited the S-phase that coincided with the down-regulation of the pyrimidine pathway.In summary, we conclude that the cell cycle-dependent up- and down-regulation of the rate of pyrimidine biosynthesis can be attributed to the sequential, concerted action of the PKA and MAP kinase signaling cascades. The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the regulatory sites on the CPSase domain of CAD alter the response to UTP and PRPP, allosteric effectors that control the flux through the pyrimidine pathway. The activity of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway closely parallels the growth rate of the cell and is highest during periods of rapid proliferation (1–13). Cells growing in culture synthesize pyrimidines at a rapid rate during the exponential growth phase, but the pathway is much less active when the cells enter the stationary phase or have their growth arrested by serum deprivation (14Levine E.M.

However, subsequent studies (32Sahay N. Guy H.I. Xin L. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31195-31202Google Scholar) showed that PKA phosphorylation resulted in a decrease in the affinity for the activator, PRPP, an effect that would be expected to down-regulate the pathway. Thus, PKA phosphorylation alone cannot account for the activation of the pathway in rapidly growing cells. MAP kinases (33Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Google Scholar) are ubiquitous components of the mitogen-activated cascade that result in cellular proliferation in response to growth factors. Stimulation of quiescent cells with epidermal growth factor results in the activation of the MAP kinase cascade and the phosphorylation of Thr-456 in the A1 subdomain (Fig. 1) of the CAD CPSase (34Graves L.M. Guy H.I. Kozlowski P. Huang M. Lazarowski E. Pope R.M. Collins M.A. Dahlstrand E.N. Earp III, H.S. Evans D.R. Nature. 2000; 403: 328-332Google Scholar). MAP kinase phosphorylation both in vivo andin vitro has no effect on any of the catalytic activities of CAD but relieves UTP inhibition and stimulates PRPP activation of the CPSase. Both of these changes in allosteric regulation would be expected to increase the rate of pyrimidine biosynthesis. We have recently shown (18Sigoillot F.D. Evans D.R. Guy H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15745-15751Google Scholar) that the activation of pyrimidine biosynthesis in exponentially growing BHK 165-23 cells is a consequence of the MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of CAD and that its subsequent down-regulation as the culture became confluent is associated with dephosphorylation of the MAP kinase site and phosphorylation by PKA. To more precisely define the mechanism of growth-related activation and down-regulation of pyrimidine biosynthesis, the activity of the pathway and the role of the diverse control mechanisms was examined as BHK 165-23 cells traversed the cell cycle. DISCUSSIONThe results reported here are in agreement with previous studies of synchronously growing cells showing that the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway is activated just before S phase and subsequently down-regulated at the transition between S and G2 (Fig. 8). We found that the rate increased 1.9-fold from 1.0 pmol/min/106 cells in G1 to 1.85 pmol/min/106 cells in mid-S phase. These rates are in good agreement with the rate of pyrimidine biosynthesis of 0.5 pmol/min/106 cells measured in asynchronous cultures of the same cells during the first 24 h after passage but are significantly lower than the rate of 4.2 pmol/min/106 cells measured in fully established, exponentially growing cells (18Sigoillot F.D. Evans D.R. Guy H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15745-15751Google Scholar). The lower rate of pyrimidine biosynthesis after serum starvation can probably be attributed to the low intracellular concentration of the CPSase substrate, ATP.The average values for the intracellular nucleotide triphosphates in mammalian cells, compiled by Traut in an exhaustive literature search (50Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Google Scholar), were found to be 567 ± 460, 278 ± 242, 3152 ± 1698, and 468 ± 224 μm for UTP, CTP, ATP, and GTP, respectively. The nucleotide triphosphate concentrations, measured by HPLC analysis of extracts of exponentially growing BHK cells (Table I), were for the most part within the expected range. It is noteworthy, that the nucleotide concentrations after stimulation of serum-deprived cells were appreciably lower that the values in exponentially growing cultures. Moreover, the nucleotide pools did not appreciably expand during the course of the cell cycle. Only modest increases were observed even after 20 h of post-serum stimulation (Table I). These results suggest that 1) the increased rate of pyrimidine biosynthesis nearly matches the rate of utilization of nucleotides for the synthesis of macromolecules during the S phase of the cell cycle, and 2) several cycles of cell division are apparently required before the nucleotide pools can be fully replenished after serum starvation. ATP, for example, was found to be 0.6 mm in serum-starved cells compared with a value of 2.9 mm obtained in fully established cultures. The low ATP concentration would be expected to result in an ∼5-fold decrease 3The CPSase activity in the cell was calculated at the ATP concentrations of 0.4 and 2.9 mm using the Hill equation assuming a K m of 3.4 mm and a Hill coefficient of 1.3, values measured (41Sigoillot F.D. Evans D.R. Guy H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24809-24817Google Scholar) for purified CAD in the absence of allosteric effectors. Because the kinetic parameters are dependent on the concentration of effectors, the calculation is only approximate. in CPSase activity in serum-starved cells, in reasonable agreement with the 7-fold decrease in the flux through the pyrimidine pathway compared with the rate in exponential cultures.As described above, the increase in pyrimidine biosynthesis during the S-phase of the cell cycle cannot be attributed to an increase in the CPSase activity measured in the absence of allosteric effectors or to autophosphorylation of CAD. The CAD autophosphorylation site was nearly completely phosphorylated in vivo, representing a constant phosphothreonine background throughout the cell cycle. However, previous studies show (18Sigoillot F.D. Evans D.R. Guy H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15745-15751Google Scholar) that the CPSase activity of CAD, and consequently the rate of pyrimidine biosynthesis, is controlled by PKA- and MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the CAD CPSase domain.The activity of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway was up-regulated as the cells entered the S phase, reached a maximum at 11 h, and then decreased as the cells exited the S phase. The increase in the pyrimidine biosynthetic activity during S phase closely paralleled the response of CPSase to allosteric effectors. During S phase, UTP inhibition was abolished, and PRPP activation increased 2-fold. This altered response to allosteric effectors could readily account for the 1.9-fold activation of the pathway.Similar changes in allosteric regulation have been observed in asynchronous cultures in response to MAP kinase phosphorylation (18Sigoillot F.D. Evans D.R. Guy H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15745-15751Google Scholar). In synchronized BHK cells, the MAP kinase activity increased rapidly and peaked at 5 h but remained elevated for the duration of the cycle. However, the phosphorylation of the MAP kinase site of CAD did not correlate with the highest MAP kinase activities, and no significant phosphorylation of this site could be detected for 7 h. The resistance of CAD to MAP kinase phosphorylation can probably be attributed to PKA phosphorylation since we have found 4D. H. Kotsis, M. Sigoillot, H. I. Guy, and D. Evans, unpublished results. that prior phosphorylation of CAD by PKA blocks phosphorylation by MAP kinase. CAD serine phosphorylation closely paralleled the activity of PKA, highest initially after serum stimulation and decreasing during the next 7 h. A decrease in PKA activity has been previously shown to be a prerequisite for entry into S phase (44Feliciello A. Gallo A. Mele E. Porcellini A. Troncone G. Garbi C. Gottesman M. Avvedimento E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 303-311Google Scholar). These results suggest that the activating MAP kinase phosphorylation of CAD is delayed until the PKA site is dephosphorylated. Another factor that could potentially influence the phosphorylation of CAD may be its intracellular location relative to the kinases. MAP kinase was found by fluorescence microscopy to be distributed throughout the cell but was concentrated in the nucleus during G1 and S. In contrast, PKA was initially localized in the nucleus but is translocated into the cytosol late in G1. CAD was cytosolic during G1 and migrated into the nucleus, where there were high levels of MAP kinase and low levels of PKA during S phase. Experiments are currently under way to follow up on these interesting observations.The down-regulation of the pathway occurred as cells emerged from the S phase at about 14–15 h post-serum stimulation. At this point, the MAP kinase activity remained elevated, and the CAD MAP kinase site began to dephosphorylate. Moreover, at 15 h the phosphorylation of CAD by PKA began to increase once again. PKA phosphorylation is known to reduce the sensitivity of CAD to PRPP activation (32Sahay N. Guy H.I. Xin L. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31195-31202Google Scholar). Accordingly, a 1.7-fold decrease in the response to PRPP was observed (Fig. 5) as the cells exited the S-phase that coincided with the down-regulation of the pyrimidine pathway.In summary, we conclude that the cell cycle-dependent up- and down-regulation of the rate of pyrimidine biosynthesis can be attributed to the sequential, concerted action of the PKA and MAP kinase signaling cascades. The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the regulatory sites on the CPSase domain of CAD alter the response to UTP and PRPP, allosteric effectors that control the flux through the pyrimidine pathway. The results reported here are in agreement with previous studies of synchronously growing cells showing that the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway is activated just before S phase and subsequently down-regulated at the transition between S and G2 (Fig. 8).

Gáspári Z. Jurka J. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 967-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Expansions of TR tracts located in specific genes cause more than 14 hereditary neuromuscular diseases (2Cummings C.J. Zoghbi H.Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). TRs associated with disease include 5′-d(CAG)n/5′-d(CTG)n, (abbreviated as CAG/CTG) associated with Huntington's disease and myotonic dystrophy, among others (reviewed in Ref. 2Cummings C.J. Zoghbi H.Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), GCC/GGC, associated with fragile X syndrome, and GAA/TTC repeats, associated with Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA). The disease expansions vary from a few triplets in a coding region of the gene (type I) to hundreds of triplets located in a noncoding region of the gene (type II). The expansions exactly mimic the sequence of the repeat tract and occur during a single transmission from parent to child.Studies in several model systems indicate that repeat instability is dependent on the length of the repeat tract and its orientation in the genome; a TR sequence capable of forming hairpins, constructed by cloning to be oriented relative to an origin of replication so that it is the template replicated by discontinuous lagging strand replication, is predicted to suffer deletions. The same sequence, oriented so that it is the Okazaki fragment, is predicted to suffer expansions (3Kunst C.B. Warren S.T.

Nature. 1991; 352: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Lagging strand replication is predicted to lead to contractions by replication across hairpins formed in the template strand and expansion by DNA slippage to give hairpin formation in the Okazaki fragment (4Kang S.

Blockage of DNA replication within a repeat tract induces expansion in vitroand is predicted to induce DNA slippage and thus expansion in vivo (29Lyons-Darden T. Topal M.D. J. Biol.

This leaves open the question of how the large single-stranded regions resulting from massive expansions characteristic of FRDA manage to avoid DNA repair.TR expansion is predicted to occur in vivo as the result of DNA slippage of the Okazaki fragment occurring during DNA lagging strand replication of the TR tract (31Eichler E.E.

Nature. 2001; 411: 757-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In vitro models of DNA replication and repair have been used to generate type I and type II repeat expansion. Initial attempts at TR expansions during DNA replication used the complementary triplet repeats as template and primer (34Schlötterer C. Tautz D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 35Ji J. Clegg N.J. Peterson K.R. Jackson A.L. Laird C.D. Loeb L.A.

Recent studies have added unique sequences flanking the TR tract to better mimic the in vivo situation of the repeats (29Lyons-Darden T. Topal M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25975-25978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The latter study found that priming from within the TR tract gave much higher levels of expansion compared with priming from within the upstream unique flanking sequence. Priming from within the TR tract mimics the occurrence of an Okazaki fragment completely within a repeat tract. One of the most common lesions that arise in cellular DNA is the loss of a base to give an abasic site (39Lindahl T. Nature. 1992; 362: 709-715Crossref Scopus (4273) Google Scholar), which blocks DNA replication (40Paz-Elizur T. Takeshita M. Livneh Z.

An abasic site analog, tetrahydrofuran (THF), synthesized at the 3′ terminus of the template-strand repeat tract greatly enhanced expansion during replication of the template, suggesting a possible role for DNA damage in TR expansion (29Lyons-Darden T. Topal M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25975-25978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The lesion enhanced triplet repeat expansion presumably by increasing the opportunities for DNA slippage by keeping the growing strand end within the repeat tract (29Lyons-Darden T. Topal M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25975-25978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Another recent in vitro model system, which uses unique sequences flanking the TR, mimics DNA slippage at a nick during DNA repair synthesis within the DNA construct (42Hartenstine M.J. Goodman M.F.

Using these in vitro replication models, type I expansions of many triplet repeats have been generated using bacterial polymerases (34Schlötterer C. Tautz D.

Massive type II expansions of AAT, ATT, and CAG growing strand repeat tracts were achieved using the in vitro lagging strand model (29Lyons-Darden T. Topal M.D. J. Biol.

(Throughout this paper we refer to the sequence of the expanded growing strand. Thus, expanded TTC repeat means that the TTC growing strand grew beyond the length expected from replication of the template strand.) The DNA sequences of the type I GCC/GGC expansions (35Ji J. Clegg N.J. Peterson K.R. Jackson A.L. Laird C.D. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2835-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and the type II expansions by Klenow pol I (29Lyons-Darden T. Topal M.D. J. Biol.

Such demonstrations are important because other possible DNA expansion pathways, not based on DNA slippage, are predicted to give products during DNA replicationin vitro that vary from the growing strand TR sequence (22LeProust E.M. Pearson C.E. Sinden R.R. Gao X. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1063-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,43Tuntiwechapikul W. Salazar M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 854-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, in vitro DNA synthesis models are beginning to successfully mimic many facets of TR expansion in vivo.Here we report using the lagging strand replication model (29Lyons-Darden T. Topal M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25975-25978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) together with h-pol β and Escherichia coli Klenow pol I to demonstrate that large expansions occur when these polymerases copy GAA and TTC TRs in vitro. DNA sequencing and restriction enzyme cleavage demonstrate that the expansions have the correct repeat sequences. EM and nuclease cleavage experiments demonstrate that the respective expanded TTC and GAA growing strand repeats form hairpin structures and thus self-anneal.DISCUSSIONTo provide evidence for the secondary structures of the intermediates involved in expansion of the repeats associated with FRDA, we generated massive expansions of GAA and TTC repeats in vitro using h-pol β and Klenow pol I. A lagging strand replication model was used to generate the expansions (29Lyons-Darden T. Topal M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25975-25978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The model uses a template strand with unique sequences flanking the repeat tract and a covalent block to template expansion synthesized at the 3′ terminus. A replication-blocking lesion, found necessary with this model to generate massive expansions of AAT, ATT, and CAG growing strands (29Lyons-Darden T. Topal M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25975-25978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), was unnecessary for, and in fact interfered with, GAA growing strand expansion. It significantly aided TTC growing strand expansion, but TTC showed expansion without DNA damage. This is consistent with the proclivity of GAA/TTC to form intramolecular triplexes that block DNA replication primed farther upstream (26Wells R.D. Collier D.A. Hanvey J.C. Shimizu M. Wohlrab F. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2939-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 27Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Mirkin S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 65-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 28Ohshima K. Montermini L. Wells R.D. Pandolfo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14588-14595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The presence of the damage in the template strand may interfere with formation of the triplex when GAA is the template repeat.Given the different possible ways to generate apparent expanded molecules (22LeProust E.M. Pearson C.E. Sinden R.R. Gao X. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1063-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 43Tuntiwechapikul W. Salazar M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 854-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we characterized the intermediate expansion products using DNA sequencing, EM, and endonuclease digestion. In addition, we repeated the experiments using only the two nucleotides required to replicate the template TR tract so that contaminating complementary nucleotides could not be incorporated into the expansion products at a low level. Finally, we synthesized 99- and 51-mer GAA and TTC oligonucleotides, and we determined their abilities to reanneal using endonuclease digestion experiments.DNA sequencing of cloned reaction products from the GAA and TTC expansion reactions demonstrated that the expansion products mimicked the growing strand repeat tract. The sizes of the sequenced products are consistent with the instability of repeat tracts in E. coli (4Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). We cannot rule out the possibility that sequences that varied from the GAA/TTC repeats were preferentially deleted during cloning in E. coli. That seems unlikely, however, since interrupted sequences are relatively stable in E. coli (46Kang S. Ohshima K. Jaworski A. Wells R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the repeated isolation of pure GAA/TTC sequences argues that thein vitro expansion products mimicked the growing strand repeat sequences.The thicknesses and secondary structures of the DNA products determined by EM (Fig. 2) are consistent with the EM of duplex DNA (45Griffith J.D. Christiansen G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1978; 7: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The spreading technique used to prepare the DNA for EM collapses ssDNA (45Griffith J.D. Christiansen G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1978; 7: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The 5′ ends of the DNA molecules were tagged with biotin-streptavidin that is easily visualized by EM. Most of the GAA and TTC expanded DNA molecules seen by EM were tagged at only one end. This is consistent with hairpin formation (Fig. 5 A). The expanded growing strand becomes double-stranded by folding back to give a hairpin. The large size of the expanded DNA relative to the replicated template means that the molecule will appear tagged at one end independent of whether the primer, template, or both are biotin-labeled (Fig. 5 A). The duplex DNA molecules observed increased in size with increasing reaction time. A percentage of the GAA and TTC growing strand expansion products observed by EM were tagged at both ends only when the primer was biotin-labeled. One possibility is that biotin-labeled primer molecules interacted with single-stranded loops formed by DNA fold back to give the hairpin structures (Fig. 5 A). To test this possibility, the concentration of unlabeled template DNA in the expansion reaction was doubled to compete for unannealed primer molecules. The percentage of double-stranded structures observed by EM to be tagged at both ends was reduced by almost half by the 2-fold increase in template concentration. The reduction supports the notion that a small amount of biotin-labeled primer annealed to the expanded end of some of the double-stranded structures observed by EM (Fig. 5 A). The annealing may be because of the presence of a single-stranded loop. The EM results eliminate the possibility that the observed expansion products could come from any kind of fill-in reactions involving linear arrays of multiple overlapping molecules (22LeProust E.M. Pearson C.E. Sinden R.R. Gao X. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1063-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 43Tuntiwechapikul W. Salazar M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 854-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Such reactions would have produced visual tags between the two ends of the expanded molecules when the primer and template were biotin-labeled. The products of such reactions are also predicted to have DNA sequences that vary from true TR expansions.Endonuclease digestion gave independent confirmation of the double-stranded nature of the expanded primer strand. MboII recognizes the double-stranded sequences GAAGA and TCTTC and cleaves downstream of both sequences (47Roberts R.J. Macelis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 306-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). MboII cleaved both the GAA and TTC expansion products in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3 A). On the other hand, the expanded products were relatively resistant to nuclease P1 under conditions that cleaved 98% of the control ssDNA but only 37% of the control dsDNA. Moreover, the results of nuclease P1 digestions of GGA repeat DNA provided evidence that longer dsDNA expansion products (80–95 bp) are more resistant to cleavage with nuclease P1 than shorter products (50–65 bp). These results suggest that GAA hairpin formation is dependent on DNA length and may help explain why earlier studies (21Gacy A.M. Goellner G.M. Juranic N. Macura S. McMurray C.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 533-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 22LeProust E.M. Pearson C.E. Sinden R.R. Gao X. J. Mol.

Acta. 1999; 1444: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which used shorter DNA lengths, failed to demonstrate GAA and TTC hairpin formation under physiological conditions. To test this hypothesis, longer GAA and TTC TRs (17 and 33 repeats) were synthesized and were shown to be partially susceptible to MboII cleavage under physiological conditions of temperature and salt concentration. Thus, the endonuclease cleavage experiments, like the EM experiments, support hairpin formation within the expanded strands. GAA and TTC hairpins are most likely stabilized by GA and TC base pairs, respectively. Alternating d(GA)n and d(TC)n repeats self-anneal (48Huertas D. Bellsolell L. Casasnovas J.M. Coll M. Azorin F.

Priming within the repeat tract gave dramatic amounts of type II triplet repeat expansion. No type II expansion was detected when replication was primed from the unique upstream flanking sequence. The difference in expansion abilities argues that free 3′- and 5′-ends within the repeat tract are important for expansion. Free 3′- and 5′-ends could arise from the occurrence of an Okazaki fragment completely within the boundaries of a TR tract (31Eichler E.E. Holden J.J.A. Popovich B.W. Reiss A.L. Snow K.

Homologous recombinational repair (HRR)1 is an accurate pathway for repair without base substitutions, deletions, and insertions, and therefore, it is important to maintain chromosomal integrity (3Thompson L.H.

In the HRR pathway, a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tail, which is produced at the site, invades a homologous region of the intact sister chromatid. Through this “homologous-pairing” step, an intermediate structure, the Holliday junction, in which two double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules form a four-way junction (6Holliday R. Genet. Res. 1964; 5: 282-304Crossref Scopus (1261) Google Scholar), is generated between the damaged and intact chromatids (7Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 71-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The Holliday junction can move along the DNA and has the ability to expand a heteroduplex region. This step, termed “branch migration,” is essential for the HRR pathway.In humans, genes involved in the HRR pathway, includingRad51, Rad52, Rad54,Rad54B, Brca1, Brca2,Xrcc2, Xrcc3,Rad51B/Rad51L1/hRec2(Rad51B), Rad51C/Rad51L2(Rad51C), and Rad51D/Rad51L3(Rad51D), have been identified (8Thacker J.

Mutations in several of these genes have been found in cancer patients but not in healthy individuals (2Pierce A.J. Stark J.M. Araujo F.D. Moynahan M.E. Berwick M. Jasin M.

Notably, gross chromosomal rearrangements of theRad51B gene have been reported in uterine leiomyomas, involving translocations with the HMG1C gene (10Schoenmakers E.F.P.M.

In mice, disruption of theRad51B gene results in early embryonic lethality (13Shu Z. Smith S. Wang L. Rice M.C. Kmiec E.B. Mol. Cell.

The Rad51B knockout in chicken DT40 cells impaired the HRR pathway and caused sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin, mitomycin C, and γ-rays (14Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E.

Therefore, theRad51B gene product plays an essential role in the HRR pathway in vertebrates. The human Rad51B protein is composed of 350 amino acid residues (15Albala J.S. Thelen M.P. Prange C.

Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 166-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Therefore, these five proteins, Xrcc2, Xrcc3, Rad51B, Rad51C, and Rad51D, which have similarity with Rad51, have been classified as Rad51 paralogs.In the present study, we purified the human Rad51B protein as a recombinant protein and biochemically characterized it. The purified Rad51B protein bound to ssDNA and dsDNA in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ or Mn2+ and hydrolyzed ATP in a DNA-dependent manner. When the Holliday structure coexisted with the replication-fork-like structure and B-form DNA, Rad51B only bound to the synthetic Holliday junction, suggesting that Rad51B may play a role in Holliday junction processing in the HRR pathway.DISCUSSIONAs bacterial Holliday junction-binding proteins, the RuvA·RuvB complex (RuvAB), which promotes branch migration of the Holliday junction, has been found (19Iwasaki H.

In the present study we found that Rad51B specifically binds to the synthetic Holliday junction, suggesting that Rad51B may have a role in processing the Holliday-junction intermediate in HRR. However, we could not detect branch migration activity with Rad51B (data not shown). Helicase activity, which is required to promote efficient branch migration by the RuvAB complex or RecG, also was not detected with Rad51B (data not shown). Rad51B may require a subunit(s), like the bacterial RuvAB complex, if it is involved in the branch migration process in the HRR pathway.Thus far, a eukaryotic nuclease, Mus81, which resolves the Holliday junction into two duplex DNAs, has been suggested to be a functional homolog of the bacterial Holliday-junction resolvase, the RuvC protein (57Boddy M.N.

On the other hand, an ATP-dependent branch migration activity, which co-fractionates with the Holliday junction resolving activity, has been detected in mammalian cell-free extracts (59Constantinou A.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5577-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Holliday junction migrase and resolvase may form a complex in mammals, like the bacterial RuvA, RuvB, and RuvC proteins (61van Gool A.J. Hajibagheri N.M. Stasiak A. West S.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1861-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Rad51B, which can target the Holliday junction structure, may be a subunit of the human Holliday junction-processing complex. In humans, the TIP60 complex, which is composed of fourteen subunits, was found to bind the Holliday junction structure and exhibited helicase activity, but not branch-migration activity (62Ikura T.

The TIP60 complex contains TIP49a (also known as RUVBL1, NMP238, or Pontin52) and TIP49b, which have similarity to RuvB (63Qiu X.B. Lin Y.L. Thome K.C. Pian P. Schlegel B.P. Weremowicz S. Parvin J.D.

Further studies are required to identify the factors that process the Holliday junction during HRR in mammals. Chromosomes are continuously subjected to attacks by exogenous and endogenous mutagens, which damage the genomic DNA. Chromosomal double strand breaks, which are potential inducers of chromosome aberrations and tumorigenesis, are caused by ionizing radiation, oxygen free-radicals, DNA cross-linking reagents, and DNA replication failure (1Cox M.M.

Jasin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: S52-S58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Homologous recombinational repair (HRR)1 is an accurate pathway for repair without base substitutions, deletions, and insertions, and therefore, it is important to maintain chromosomal integrity (3Thompson L.H. Schild D. Mutat. Res. 2001; 477: 131-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 4Ferguson D.O. Alt F.W. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5572-5579Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 5van Gent D.C. Hoeijmarkers J.H. Kanaar R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). In the HRR pathway, a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tail, which is produced at the site, invades a homologous region of the intact sister chromatid. Through this “homologous-pairing” step, an intermediate structure, the Holliday junction, in which two double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules form a four-way junction (6Holliday R. Genet. Res. 1964; 5: 282-304Crossref Scopus (1261) Google Scholar), is generated between the damaged and intact chromatids (7Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 71-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The Holliday junction can move along the DNA and has the ability to expand a heteroduplex region. This step, termed “branch migration,” is essential for the HRR pathway. In humans, genes involved in the HRR pathway, includingRad51, Rad52, Rad54,Rad54B, Brca1, Brca2,Xrcc2, Xrcc3,Rad51B/Rad51L1/hRec2(Rad51B), Rad51C/Rad51L2(Rad51C), and Rad51D/Rad51L3(Rad51D), have been identified (8Thacker J. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Wood R.D. Mitchell M. Sgouros J. Lindahl T. Science. 2001; 291: 1284-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Mutations in several of these genes have been found in cancer patients but not in healthy individuals (2Pierce A.J. Stark J.M. Araujo F.D. Moynahan M.E. Berwick M. Jasin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: S52-S58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Notably, gross chromosomal rearrangements of theRad51B gene have been reported in uterine leiomyomas, involving translocations with the HMG1C gene (10Schoenmakers E.F.P.M. Huysmans C. van de Ven W.J.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 19-23PubMed Google Scholar, 11Takahashi T. Nagai N. Oda H. Ohama K. Kamada N. Miyagawa K. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001; 30: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and in a pulmonary chondroid hamartoma (12Blank C. Schoenmakers E.F.P.M. Rogalla P. Huys E.H.L.P.G. van Rijk A.A.F. Drieschner N. Bullerdiek J. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2001; 95: 17-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In mice, disruption of theRad51B gene results in early embryonic lethality (13Shu Z. Smith S. Wang L. Rice M.C. Kmiec E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8686-8693Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Rad51B gene product is essential for development. The Rad51B knockout in chicken DT40 cells impaired the HRR pathway and caused sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin, mitomycin C, and γ-rays (14Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Fukushima T. Morrison C. Albala J.S. Swagemakers S.M. Kanaar R. Thompson L.H. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6476-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Therefore, theRad51B gene product plays an essential role in the HRR pathway in vertebrates. The human Rad51B protein is composed of 350 amino acid residues (15Albala J.S. Thelen M.P. Prange C. Fan W. Christensen M. Thompson L.H. Lennon G.G. Genomics. 1997; 46: 476-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Cartwright R. Dunn A.M. Simpson P.J. Tambini C.E. Thacker J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and has about 20% amino acid identity with the human Rad51 protein, like other human proteins such as the Xrcc2, Xrcc3, Rad51C, and Rad51D proteins (17Thaker J. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 166-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Therefore, these five proteins, Xrcc2, Xrcc3, Rad51B, Rad51C, and Rad51D, which have similarity with Rad51, have been classified as Rad51 paralogs. In the present study, we purified the human Rad51B protein as a recombinant protein and biochemically characterized it. The purified Rad51B protein bound to ssDNA and dsDNA in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ or Mn2+ and hydrolyzed ATP in a DNA-dependent manner. When the Holliday structure coexisted with the replication-fork-like structure and B-form DNA, Rad51B only bound to the synthetic Holliday junction, suggesting that Rad51B may play a role in Holliday junction processing in the HRR pathway.

In the present study we found that Rad51B specifically binds to the synthetic Holliday junction, suggesting that Rad51B may have a role in processing the Holliday-junction intermediate in HRR. However, we could not detect branch migration activity with Rad51B (data not shown). Helicase activity, which is required to promote efficient branch migration by the RuvAB complex or RecG, also was not detected with Rad51B (data not shown). Rad51B may require a subunit(s), like the bacterial RuvAB complex, if it is involved in the branch migration process in the HRR pathway. Thus far, a eukaryotic nuclease, Mus81, which resolves the Holliday junction into two duplex DNAs, has been suggested to be a functional homolog of the bacterial Holliday-junction resolvase, the RuvC protein (57Boddy M.N.

Rad51B, which can target the Holliday junction structure, may be a subunit of the human Holliday junction-processing complex.

https://openalex.org/W2036794981,"Pigmentation is a significant determinant of individual susceptibility to cutaneous melanoma, with fair skinned subjects at highest risk of developing this neoplasm. Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene variants alter pigment synthesis in vivo, and are causally associated with red hair and fair skin in humans. MC1R variants are more frequent in subjects with melanoma, and increase the risk of developing this tumour in sporadic and familial cases. MC1R variants may predispose to melanoma as a result of alterations in skin pigmentation (which affords less protection against incident ultraviolet radiation). However, melanoma cells synthesize and release alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (αMSH, the ligand for MC1R), therefore MC1R variants could alter the autocrine effects of αMSH on melanoma cell behaviour, thereby affecting early melanoma development and progression via non-pigmentary mechanisms. B16G4F melanoma cells, which are functionally null at Mc1r, were stably transfected with wild type and variant (Arg151Cys, Arg160Trp, and Asp294His) human MC1R. At similar MC1 receptor numbers per cell, αMSH increased intracellular cAMP in wild type MC1R transfected melanoma cells, but the cAMP response was compromised in the variant MC1R transfected clones. In growth inhibition experiments, αMSH significantly reduced growth of wild type MC1R transfected cells, but had no effect on cells transfected with variant MC1R. In addition, binding to fibronectin was significantly reduced by αMSH in the wild type transfectants whereas this was not observed in the variant transfected clones; binding to laminin was not affected by αMSH in this cell line. These results provide evidence for differences in melanoma cell behaviour secondary to MC1R variants, and suggest an alternative non-pigmentary mechanism whereby MC1R variants could modify melanoma susceptibility or progression."

In humans, the major pharmacological effects of PPARα activation by fibrates are the reduction of plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Mechanistically, decreases in triglyceride-rich plasma lipoprotein levels could occur via accelerated catabolism, decreased synthesis, or both. Indeed, activation of PPARα by fibrates promotes β-oxidation of fatty acids in the peroxisome as well as in the mitochondria, thus reducing the fatty acid available to the liver for triglyceride synthesis (2Latruffe N.

Conversely, under appropriate metabolic states, such as those when starved animals are fed a high carbohydrate diet, increased lipogenesis in liver occurs in part by means of transcriptional activation of genes associated with de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, such as fatty acid synthase (FAS), via the transcription factor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP1) (3Kim J.B.

Moreover, LXR target genes are pivotal to overall lipid metabolism, since potent LXR agonists activate genes involved in catabolism of cholesterol to bile acids, in regulation of several genes important for reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral tissues, in high density lipoprotein accumulation, and in cholesterol excretion into bile or intestinal lumen. The battery of LXR target genes mediating these effects includes Cyp7A1, ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1), ABCG1, apolipoprotein E, lipoprotein lipase, cholesterol ester transfer protein, ABCG5, and ABCG8 (10Peet D.J.

Thus, cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis involves integration of synthesis and degradation pathways that are controlled by the nuclear proteins PPARα, SREBP, and LXR. Repression of de novo fatty acid synthesis in liver by fenofibrate has been observed, but the mechanism of repression remains unknown (19Kritchevsky D. Tepper S.A. Story J.A. Pharmacol. Res. Commun. 1979; 11: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Here we describe a mechanism by which fenofibrate ester may decrease fatty acid synthesis both in vitro and in vivo by decreasing expression of SREBP1 and FAS. Our studies reveal that fenofibrate ester represses the expression of SREBP1 and FAS mRNA by directly binding to and antagonizing LXR. Interestingly, the ester form of multiple fibrate molecules bind LXR with greater affinity than their respective carboxylic acid derivatives bind to PPARα. Importantly, the effects of fenofibrate on LXR target gene repression appear promoter-specific; fenofibrate does not repress LXR agonist-induced ABC transporter gene expression either in liver or in macrophages. These findings provide an unexpected mechanism by which fenofibrate ester inhibits SREBP1 transcription and lipogenesis without negating the beneficial role LXR that plays in mediating secretion of sterols from the liver and in increasing reverse cholesterol transport from macrophages. The human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HepG2 (HB-8065; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), was maintained in monolayer culture at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HepG2 cells were stably transfected at 100:1 with 3XSRE-luciferase (SRE; gtggggtgat) that is controlled by the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase basal promoter from −105 to +51 (20Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) and pHygEGFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Stable cells were selected in medium containing 800 μg/ml hygromycin. For transient transfection of HEK293 cells, 4 × 104 cells were plated into 24-well dishes. Each transfection contained 100 ng of luciferase reporter, 100 ng of CMV-driven expression plasmid where indicated (pM LXRα LBD; amino acids 162–447, pCMV6 LXRα; NR1H3, accession number NM_005693), and 50 ng of CMV β-galactosidase. The luciferase reporter plasmids that were used include pGL3B-E1b-3XLXRE and pG5luc (Promega, Madison, WI). Firefly luciferase activity was measured using standard luciferase substrate reagents (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA) and was corrected using β-galactosidase activity as transfection control. Total RNA was isolated from cells or tissue by the Trizol method (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers and Omniscript (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). TAQMANTM real time PCR analysis was applied using prepared reagents and protocols from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA).

All PCRs were performed in triplicate using an Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Relative levels of mRNA are expressed as a ratio of the target gene mRNA values to the values obtained using the 18 S rRNA probe set (Applied Biosystems). The scintillation proximity radioligand binding assay for LXR was previously described (21Janowski B.A. Grogan M.J. Jones S.A. Wisely G.B. Kliewer S.A. Corey E.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Briefly, we utilized 800 ng of baculovirus-expressed His-tagged LXRαLBD protein (amino acids 162–447) or 600 ng of LXRβLBD protein (amino acids 202–461), 25 nm[3H]25-Hydroxycholesterol (Amersham Biosciences), 0.05 mg of yttrium silicate polylysine-coated SPA beads (Amersham Biosciences), and varying concentrations of competitor per well of a 96-well OptiPlate (Packard Instrument Co.). Protein, radioligand, and competitor were added to the plate. SPA beads were then added to the assay plate followed by 10 min of gentle shaking at room temperature protected from light. The plates were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 2 h prior to reading in a TopCount plate reader (Packard Instrument Co.). PPARα binding assays were performed using the ABCD assay (22Glass C.K. Franco R. Weinberger C. Albert V.R. Evans R.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1987; 329: 738-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) as described previously (23Brooks D.A. Etgen G.J. Rito C.J. Shuker A.J. Dominianni S.J. Warshawsky A.M. Ardecky R.

To determine fenofibrate ester and acid concentrations in liver, mice (129Sv) were dosed for 7 days with 300 mg/kg/day fenofibrate, and following a final dose, perfused livers were collected at various time points. Individual liver samples (1.0 g) were homogenized in acetonitrile. Debris was pelleted by centrifugation. Supernatant (50 μl) was diluted with 150 μl of 0.2% formic acid. Fenofibrate ester and acid concentrations were measured on a Sciex API 3000 mass spectrophotometer. To measure SREBP1, FAS, ABCA1, ABCG5, and ABCG8 gene expression, mice (129Sv) were dosed for 7 days with 50 mg/kg/day T0901317, 100 mg/kg/day fenofibrate, or a combination of both. Liver expression of the various mRNAs was measured by quantitative PCR. To determine whether fenofibrate can repress de novo fatty acid synthesis at the level of gene transcription, we studied the regulation of SREBP1-mediated gene transcription by fenofibrate. A stable HepG2 cell line harboring an integrated luciferase reporter gene driven by the minimal thymidine kinase promoter preceded by three tandem repeats of a sterol response element was generated (HepG2 3XSRE). HepG2 3XSRE cells were treated with the LXR agonist, T0901317, in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of fenofibrate (Fig. 1 A). The LXR agonist effectively caused a 5-fold increase in SREBP-induced transcription of the reporter gene; fenofibrate alone did not significantly affect reporter activity. When added together, fenofibrate inhibited LXR-induced SREBP activity in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 ∼25 μm). We explored whether fenofibrate represses LXR-mediated induction of endogenous SREBP1 mRNA expression in HepG2 cells by quantitative PCR analysis (Fig. 1 B). The LXR agonist increased SREBP1 mRNA levels 4-fold as shown previously, and fenofibrate alone had no effect on basal levels of SREBP1 mRNA (6Schultz J.R., Tu, H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C., Li, L. Schwendner S. Wang S. Thoolen M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Lustig K.D. Shan B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2831-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). The addition of fenofibrate to T0901317-treated cells resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of induced SREBP1 mRNA levels, which is consistent with the decrease observed in HepG2 3XSRE cells. These data indicate that fenofibrate may repress genes required forde novo fatty acid synthesis by disrupting LXR-mediated SREBP1 gene activation. Whether fenofibrate does indeed alter LXR-mediated transactivation was tested by assessing the ability of fenofibrate to inhibit an LXRE-luciferase reporter gene in cells expressing exogenous human LXRα. Treatment of transfected HEK293 cells with T0901317 caused powerful induction of the reporter gene. Fenofibrate inhibited T0901317-induced reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of ∼25 μm (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, the natural LXR agonist (22R)-hydroxycholesterol (22RHC) induced LXRα activity that was potently inhibited by fenofibrate (data not shown). Interestingly, basal LXRα activity also was inhibited, suggesting either the presence of an endogenous ligand or low constitutive activity of the receptor that can be inhibited by an antagonist (24Bramlett K.S. Burris T.P. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 76: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with LXRβ (data not shown). Hence, fenofibrate can inhibit LXR-dependent transcription, irrespective of the nature of the LXR ligand. To test the possibility that fenofibrate competes directly for agonist binding to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of LXR, we used chimeric receptors encoding the LXR-LBD fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain that were co-transfected with a Gal4-responsive luciferase reporter into HEK293 cells. The LXR agonist elicited a robust transcriptional response from Gal4-LXRα-LBD. Whereas fenofibrate by itself did not induce transcription (Fig. 2 B), it caused potent inhibition of LXR agonist-induced LBD-mediated transcriptional activation. Thus, it became apparent that fenofibrate action might be due to direct modulation of LXR. If true, fenofibrate should bind to recombinant LXR-LBD proteins in vitro; therefore, an SPA was developed using radiolabeled 25-hydroxycholesterol as ligand (Fig. 2 C) (21Janowski B.A. Grogan M.J. Jones S.A. Wisely G.B. Kliewer S.A. Corey E.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Fenofibrate bound to LXRα, potently displacing the tritiated 25-hydroxycholesterol. These findings suggest that in addition to increasing β-oxidation of fatty acids via activation of PPARα, fenofibrate also may modulate LXR-mediated transcription of genes involved in the lipogenic signaling pathway by direct antagonism of LXR. Several fibrate derivatives have been used clinically in the treatment of hyperlipidemia, namely bezafibrate, gemfibrozil (Lopid®), and fenofibrate (Tricor®). In contrast to fenofibrate, which is formulated in its ester form, the other fibrates are utilized as carboxylic acids. We examined both the ester and acid derivatives of each fibrate molecule and determined whether other fibrate esters or fibric acid derivatives could modulate LXR-dependent transcription. HEK293 cells transiently transfected either with LXRα and LXRE-luciferase plasmids or with Gal4-LXRα and 5XUAS-luciferase plasmids were treated with T0901317 in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of the fibrate esters and acids. The LXR agonist induced transcriptional activity, which was sustained in the presence of all carboxylic acid PPARα ligands (Fig. 3). However, each of the corresponding fibrate esters repressed agonist-induced transcription with varying potencies. Consistent with this observation, the fibrate esters bound only to the LXRs, whereas the fibric acids were specific for PPARα (Table I). These data expose a degree of promiscuity and similarity in recognition of ligands by these two nuclear receptors. Clearly, the ester/acid moiety acts as a switch that determines LXR versus PPARα affinity, yet the remaining portion of the ligand seems to have relatively little impact on this selectivity. That this relationship is not restricted to a single structural class of ligands (fibratesversus Wy14643) indicates that ligand sharing by PPARα and the LXRs may be common. Indeed, the primary amino acid sequences of human PPARα and human LXRα ligand binding domains are 30% identical and share 50% similarity. Since PPARα and the LXRs are essential regulators of lipid metabolism, related natural ligands that regulate both receptors may exist.Table IFibrate esters bind the LXR-LBDLXRα binding assay was performed as described in the legend to Fig. 2 using increasing concentrations of fenofibrate ester or acid, gemfibrozil ester or acid, bezafibrate ester or acid, clofibrate ester or acid, and Wy14643 ester or acid.

The fenofibrate ester is rapidly converted into the carboxylic acid form by esterases in the liver and plasma (25Caldwell J. Cardiology. 1989; 76 Suppl. 1: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It has been assumed that the pharmacologically relevant form of fenofibrate is the acid form due to its specificity for PPARα and the lack of detectable ester in the plasma. However, since the primary target tissue for the hypolipidemic effects of the fenofibric acid (PPARα) and ester (LXR) is the liver, we compared the relative levels of these two compounds in the liver in order to determine the relevance of the LXR antagonist component of fenofibrate action. Mice were treated with fenofibrate for duration of 7 days followed by collection of plasma and liver at multiple time points after the final dose administration. Consistent with previous reports, we observed that fenofibrate ester was undetectable in mouse serum, whereas the fenofibric acid metabolite was easily detected (data not shown). In contrast, fenofibrate ester was readily detectable in the liver (Fig. 4 A). The highest concentration of fenofibrate ester, 3.7 μg/g, was present at 30 min. After 1 h, fenofibrate ester reached steady-state levels in the liver that persisted for 24 h. Although the ester levels were lower than the acid levels in the liver, the relative amount is consistent with the potential for affecting LXR activity, based on the greater affinity of the ester for the LXRs relative to acid affinity for PPARα. Furthermore, the concentration of fenofibrate that is required to inhibit LXR transactivation might be achievable in human liver, given commonly prescribed doses of fenofibrate ester (160 mg/day). In order to determine whether indeed there is an LXR-mediated effect of fenofibrate treatment in vivo, we examined the ability of this drug to antagonize the expression of lipogenic LXR target genes in T0901317 treated mice. After 7 days of treatment either with vehicle, fenofibrate, T0901317, or a combination of T0901317 and fenofibrate, the level of SREBP1 and FAS mRNA expression in liver was measured by quantitative PCR. Mice treated with T0901317 expressed 6-fold higher levels of SREBP1 mRNA and 12-fold higher levels of FAS mRNA, as compared with the vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 4 B). Administration of fenofibrate ester alone promoted a decrease in the basal level of SREBP1 and FAS expression. This may be due to antagonism of endogenous LXR agonists in the liver. In agreement with the ability of fenofibrate to antagonize LXR-induced expression of SREBP1 mRNAin vitro, we observed an ∼3-fold reduction in T0901317-induced SREBP1 and FAS mRNA levels in vivo. Thus, the novel LXR antagonist action of the fenofibrate ester may be relevant in vivo. Increasing evidence supports the notion that LXRs serve as sensors that respond to elevated intracellular sterol concentrations by increasing the expression of genes that reduce the sterol burden. ApoA1-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages to high density lipoprotein requires the expression of the ABCA1 transporter, which is controlled, in part, by LXR/RXR heterodimers (12Venkateswaran A.

Likewise, LXR regulates the expression of ABCG5 and ABCG8 genes that promote secretion of sterols from the liver and decrease intestinal sterol retention, thereby facilitating coordinate regulation of sterol efflux and elimination. We explored the possibility that fenofibrate ester could adversely repress LXR-induced ABC gene expression both in liver and in THP-1 macrophages. The same liver samples from mice treated with T0901317 and fenofibrate in Fig. 4were evaluated for ABCA1, ABCG5, and ABCG8 gene expression levels. Both ABCA1 and ABCG5 mRNA levels were increased ∼5-fold, and ABCG8 increased 3-fold upon treatment with T0901317 as compared with the vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 5 A). Administration of fenofibrate ester alone caused slight yet significant increases in ABCA1, ABCG5, and ABCG8 mRNA levels (p < 0.05). In contrast to the ability of fenofibrate to antagonize LXR-induced expression of SREBP1 and FAS mRNA, fenofibrate did not reduce LXR-induced expression of the ABC transporters in liver. Likewise, the addition of fenofibrate either to 22RHC- or to T0901317-stimulated THP-1 macrophage cells did not diminish LXR-induced expression of endogenous ABCA1 mRNA (Fig. 5 B). The observed increase in ABC transporter expression could be due to PPARα activation of the endogenous LXRα promoter causing increased in vivo levels of LXRα (34Tobin K.A. Steineger H.H. Alberti S.

Unlike the endogenous LXR antagonist geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, fenofibrate does not negate the beneficial role LXR plays in reverse cholesterol transport in macrophages (36Forman B.M. Ruan B.

Rather, fenofibrate exhibits LXR antagonist activity on SREBP1 and FAS gene transcription and either neutral or partial agonist activity on ABC transporter expression in liver and macrophage cells. As a transcriptional regulator of genes, such as the ABC transport proteins, apolipoprotein E, lipoprotein lipase, and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, LXR has emerged as an attractive target for the development of drugs for cardiovascular disease therapy (11Lehmann J.M.

However, in addition to the desirable pharmacologic effects of increasing reverse cholesterol transport from the periphery and hepatic cholesterol catabolism upon activating LXR target gene transcription, the undesirable side effect of increasing hepatic lipogenesis occurs in the presence of LXR agonists. Here, we have described a novel mechanism by which the clinically utilized hypolipidemic compound, fenofibrate, antagonizes LXR and represses lipogenic gene expression in liver, but not members of the ABC transporter gene family (ABCA1, ABCG5, and ABCG8). By directly binding to the LXR ligand binding domain, various fibrate ester compounds displace a naturally occurring LXR ligand in vitro, and they selectively repress LXR agonist-induced liver target gene transcription in vivo. We propose that fenofibrate could induce distinct structural changes in LXR that influence its ability to interact with other proteins, such as transcription factors residing at selective target gene promoters or with coactivators or corepressors that are critical for target gene regulation. For other nuclear receptors such as the estrogen and progesterone receptors, the relative expression of various cofactors in target tissues and the promoter context have been demonstrated to be essential for the determination of the agonist/antagonist character of a particular ligand (38Liu Z. Auboeuf D. Wong J. Chen J.D. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7940-7944Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 39Shang Y. Brown M.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the action of fibrate esters on LXR may be determined by the exact sequence of the LXRE, the contribution of additional transcription factors, and the influence of local chromatin structure of selected LXR target genes. Whether these specific promoters differentially utilize coactivators and corepressors, as is the case for estrogen-, raloxifene-, and tamoxifen-stimulated gene expression, also remains to be investigated (39Shang Y. Brown M. Science. 2002; 295: 2465-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Although obscured by mixed PPARα/LXR activity, fenofibrate ester is the first clinical compound known to target LXR, and it may be a useful tool to explore LXR pharmacology. Notably, fibrate esters bound to LXR with higher affinity than was anticipated, based on fibric acid potencies in PPARα-based assays (Table I) (42Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Duriez P. Curr. Atheroscler. Rep. 2001; 3: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Combined with further identification of molecules that interact with LXR, these studies may contribute to the design of new LXR modulators that can meet the clinical need of decreasing atherosclerotic lesions without promoting hypertriglyceridemia. Fenofibrate ester is subject to esterases and is rapidly converted to a carboxylic acid in the plasma and liver. Indeed, we readily detected fenofibric acid in mouse plasma samples but were unable to detect fenofibrate ester in plasma, yet fenofibrate ester reached steady-state levels in liver that persisted for at least 24 h (Fig. 4 A). Therefore, since fenofibrate ester did reach significant steady-state levels in the liver, it is reasonable to propose that fibrate esters (i.e. Tricor® and Lopid®) may decrease hepatic triglyceride levels, at least in part, by decreasing the expression of SREBP1 and FAS through modulation of LXR. The observation that other acidic PPARα agonists can be transformed into LXR antagonists by simple modification to an ester indicates similarity in ligand recognition. This suggests that there may be structurally similar natural ligands for these two receptors that underlie the evolutionary need for this degree of conservation of ligand recognition between PPARα and the LXRs. In fact, certain fatty acids already have been shown to function both as PPARα agonists and as LXR antagonists. Arachidonate (C20:4) binds to and activates human PPARα at micromolar concentrations (IC50 = 1.2 μm), and at approximately the same concentration, arachidonate antagonizes synthetic ligand binding to LXR and transcription of the LXR target gene, SREBP1 (43Ou J., Tu, H. Shan B. Luk A. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6027-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Interestingly, antagonism of LXR by polyunsaturated fatty acids such as C20:4,n6 or C22:6,n3 occurs in an isoform-selective manner; LXRα is antagonized, whereas LXRβ is not (44Pawar A., Xu, J. Jerks E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39243-39250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Such observations of isoform-selective modulation further imply the molecular possibility of regulating certain LXR target genes while having no effect on others through the use of distinct, isoform-selective LXR ligands. In summary, we have demonstrated that not only does the fibrate class of hypolipidemic compounds function through activation of PPARα, leading to induction of genes that control fatty acid β-oxidation; they also decrease SREBP1 and FAS gene expression by antagonizing LXR-mediated transcription. Like the activities of some selective estrogen receptor modulators, fibrate esters display LXR partial agonist/antagonist activity that is dependent on the target gene context. These data ascribe a novel regulatory function to the clinically utilized fibrate drugs and have therapeutic implications for identification of compounds that increase cellular cholesterol efflux through LXR yet counteract the accumulation of triglycerides by utilizing a promoter-selective mode of action.

In neuronal tissue it functions as a neurotransmitter that, as a gas molecule, is able to freely permeate through cell membranes. NO binding to the heme moiety of soluble guanylate cyclase activates this enzyme, leading to the generation of the second messenger, cyclic GMP (1Prevot V. Bouret S. Stefano G.B. Beauvillain J.-C. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 34: 27-41Google Scholar). Apart from this signaling pathway, NO plays an important role in a number of biological processes, including the regulation of protein function through the nitrosation of sulfur atoms of Cys residues (2Broillet M.C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1036-1042Google Scholar). Well characterized examples are those of caspase-3 (3Rössig L. Fichtlscherer B. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. Mülsch A. Dimmeler S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6823-6826Google Scholar) or theN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)1 receptor (4Choi Y.B. Lipton S.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1535-1541Google Scholar). In most examples of Cys-S-nitrosylation, the target protein is inhibited. NO is produced by at least three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) of which nNOS occurs predominantly in neuronal tissues (5Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Annu. Rev. Med. 1996; 47: 219-227Google Scholar). The activity of this isoform is mainly regulated by Ca2+ (6Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Google Scholar). Several other regulatory mechanisms for nNOS, including its inhibition by phosphorylation, have also been described (6Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Google Scholar). It is well established, moreover, that the two l-Arg derivatives, l-N ω-methylarginine (MMA) andl-N ω,N ω-dimethylarginine (ADMA), act as endogenous competitive inhibitors of NOS (7MacAllister R.J.

Their cytosolic concentrations are regulated by the enzyme dimethylargininase (l-N ω,N ω-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase, DDAH, EC 3.5.3.18). This cysteine hydrolase catabolizes MMA and ADMA to l-citrulline (l-Cit) and CH3NH2 or (CH3)2NH, respectively (11Ogawa T. Kimoto M. Sasaoka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10205-10209Google Scholar). Increased levels of MMA and ADMA in plasma and urine were found in neuronal diseases characterized by low NO levels such as schizophrenia (12Das I. Khan N.S. Puri B.K. Hirsch S.R. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 215: 209-211Google Scholar) as well as diseases linked to vascular dysfunction,e.g. uremia, atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and homocysteinemia (13Tsao P.S. Cooke J.P. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1998; 32 Suppl. 3: S48-S53Google Scholar). Conversely, NO overproduction is apparently responsible for migraine (14Thomsen L.L. Olesen J. Clinical Neurosci. 1998; 5: 28-33Google Scholar). In this case, the observed increase in expression of various enzymes including DDAH has been linked to an imbalance in NOS inhibitors (15Strijbos P.J.L.M. Read S.J. Parsons A.A. Medhurst A.D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12 Suppl. S: 470Google Scholar). In mammals, two isoforms of DDAH, DDAH-1 and DDAH-2, exist (16Leiper J.M. Santa Maria J. Chubb A. MacAllister R.J. Charles I.G. Whitley G.S.J. Vallance P. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 209-214Google Scholar). Whereas DDAH-2 is mainly expressed in the heart, kidney, and placenta, DDAH-1 is predominantly expressed in the brain (16Leiper J.M. Santa Maria J. Chubb A. MacAllister R.J. Charles I.G. Whitley G.S.J. Vallance P. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 209-214Google Scholar). The specific role for DDAH-1 in the regulation of nNOS has been suggested based on recent studies showing that both nNOS and DDAH-1 are up-regulated in injured neurons (17Nakagomi S. Kiryu-Seo S. Kimoto M. Emson P.C. Kiyama H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2160-2166Google Scholar). The characterization of DDAH-1 from bovine brain revealed a monomeric 31.2-kDa protein containing one non-catalytic Zn(II) (18Fundel S.M. Pountney D.L. Bogumil R. Gehrig P.M. Hasler D.W. Faller P.

However, Zn(II)-containing DDAH-1 could be fully or partially activated by various concentrations of phosphate, imidazole, histidine, and histamine, a process accompanied by the release of Zn(II). Based on this and the apparent Zn(II) dissociation constant in the nanomolar range, a regulatory role for Zn(II) has been suggested (19Bogumil R. Knipp M. Fundel S.M. Vašák M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4791-4798Google Scholar, 20Knipp M. Charnock J.M. Garner C.D. Vašák M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40449-40456Google Scholar). Increased levels of intracellular Zn(II) under oxidative or nitrosative stress conditions are well documented (21Bush A.I. Pettingell W.H. Multhaup G. d'Paradis M. Vonsattel J.P. Gusella J.F. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1994; 265: 1464-1467Google Scholar, 22Cuajungco M.P. Lees G.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 137-169Google Scholar, 23Aizenman E. Stout A.K. Harnett K.A. Dineley K.E. McLaughlin B. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1878-1888Google Scholar). This may account for the reduction of DDAH-1 activity and the presence of elevated ADMA levels observed in cell culture studies under these conditions (10Cooke J.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2032-2037Google Scholar). Alternatively, because DDAH is a cysteine hydrolase, the enzyme inhibition through its nitrosation is also likely. Upon submission of the present work, thein vitro inhibition of prokaryotic DDAH by NO donors has been reported. Moreover, in endothelial cell cultures heterologously expressed DDAH-2 was found S-nitrosylated following the cytokine induced expression of inducible NOS. In both instances, DDAH nitrosation was detected by an anti-S-nitrosocysteine antibody (24Leiper J. Murray-Rust J. McDonald N. Vallance P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13527-13532Google Scholar). The present work was conducted with the aim of gaining insights into the effect of NO on the structure and activity of mammalian DDAH-1in vitro. The nitrosation reaction was studied with the Zn(II)-containing and Zn(II)-free enzymes. DDAH-1 nitrosation was followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), electronic absorption spectroscopy, fluorometric SNO quantification, and measurements of enzymatic activity. The results showed that whereas the holo-form is resistant to nitrosation, two of five Cys residues of the apo-form were modified. To examine the specificity of the reaction, the amino acid sequence of DDAH-1 was determined, and the tryptic peptides of the NO modified enzyme were analyzed by ESI-MS. The results allowed the conclusion that the formation of Cys-S-NO is specific and that Zn(II) protects the enzyme against NO modification. Homology modeling revealed that the close proximity of charged residues in the tertiary structure of DDAH-1 might be responsible for the specific Cys-S-nitrosylation. MMA·HOAc and sodium 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-diazenolate-2-oxide (DEA NONOate) were purchased from Alexis, and Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP·HCl) was purchased from Pierce. Trypsin from bovine pancreas (sequencing grade) was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and the endoproteinase Glu-C from the Staphylococcus aureus strain V8 was purchased from Sigma. Dialysis tubing (cut off, 12–14 kDa; Spectrum) was rendered metal-free as described (25Auld D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 13-14Google Scholar). DDAH-1 was purified from bovine brain using the previously reported procedure (20Knipp M. Charnock J.M. Garner C.D. Vašák M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40449-40456Google Scholar). The protein homogeneity was checked by SDS-PAGE and ESI-MS. The zinc concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (IL Video 12), and that of DDAH-1 was determined by absorption spectroscopy (Cary 3, Varian) using the molar extinction coefficient ε280 nm = 14420m−1 cm−1 (19Bogumil R. Knipp M. Fundel S.M. Vašák M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4791-4798Google Scholar). The product of the enzymatic reaction (l-Cit) was determined by our previously reported colorimetric method in 96-well microtiter plates (26Knipp M. Vašák M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 257-264Google Scholar). If not otherwise stated, upon substrate addition (6.7 mm MMA) the samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. DDAH-1 concentrations in the range of 0.5–1 μm were used. As only apo-DDAH-1 is active, in some instances this form was prepared by in situincubation of the native enzyme in 250 mm imidazole/HCl, pH 7.4 (20Knipp M. Charnock J.M. Garner C.D. Vašák M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40449-40456Google Scholar). All activity measurements were performed in triplicate. One unit of DDAH-1 is defined as the amount of enzyme that produces 1 μmol of l-Cit per minute under the conditions given."
https://openalex.org/W2047888058,"DNA topoisomerase I (Topo1) manages the topological state of DNA. Cleavable complexes, the covalent Topo1-DNA intermediates, become DNA damaged when the catalytic cycles are inhibited by the anti-tumor drug camptothecin (CPT). Intriguingly, Topo1 is modified rapidly and extensively with SUMO-1, a ubiquitin-like protein, in response to CPT. This study shows that the sumoylation enhances the cleavable complex formation and apoptosis induced by CPT. Indeed, substitutions of Lys117 and Lys153, identified as Topo1 sumoylation sites, reduced the CPT-induced cleavable complexes without influencing its in vitro catalytic activity. Consistent with this observation, CPT-induced cleavable complexes of wild-type Topo1 increased in a sumoylation-dependent manner. We also found that Topo1 sumoylation occurred independently of CPT when Topo1 was inactivated by mutation of the catalytic Tyr723. These findings suggested that Topo1 inactivation by CPT treatment can trigger Topo1 sumoylation, leading to enhanced cleavable complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W2130184975,"We investigated the molecular mechanism of cyclic GMP-induced down-regulation of soluble guanylyl cyclase expression in rat aorta. 3-(5′-Hydroxymethyl-2′-furyl)-1-benzyl indazole (YC-1), an allosteric activator of this enzyme, decreased the expression of soluble guanylyl cyclase α1 subunit mRNA and protein. This effect was blocked by the enzyme inhibitor 4H-8-bromo-1,2,4-oxadiazolo(3,4-d)benz(b-1,4)oxazin-1-one (NS2028) and by actinomycin D. Guanylyl cyclase α1mRNA-degrading activity was increased in protein extracts from YC-1-exposed aorta and was attenuated by pretreatment with actinomycin D and NS2028. Gelshift and supershift analyses using an adenylate-uridylate-rich ribonucleotide from the 3′-untranslated region of the α1 mRNA and a monoclonal antibody directed against the mRNA-stabilizing protein HuR revealed HuR mRNA binding activity in aortic extracts, which was absent in extracts from YC-1-stimulated aortas. YC-1 decreased the expression of HuR, and this decrease was prevented by NS2028. Similarly, down-regulation of HuR by RNA interference in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells decreased α1 mRNA and protein expression. We conclude that HuR protects the guanylyl cyclase α1 mRNA by binding to the 3′-untranslated region. Activation of guanylyl cyclase decreases HuR expression, inducing a rapid degradation of guanylyl cyclase α1 mRNA and lowering α1 subunit expression as a negative feedback response.

Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 153-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). The active enzyme exists as an obligate heterodimer, the most abundant isoform consisting of an α1 (76–81.5 kDa) and a β1 (70 kDa) subunit (2Wedel B. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Friebe A. Schultz G. Koesling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24871-24875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). sGC mediates NO signaling via formation of guanosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP), which induces, for instance, vascular smooth muscle relaxation by activating cGMP-dependent protein kinase, prevention of contractile agonist-elicited intracellular free Ca2+ mobilization, and dephosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase (3Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). In addition to an acute activation of sGC, the output of the NO-cGMP pathway can also be controlled at the level of sGC expression. Thus, a reduced vasodilator response to exogenous NO consistent with a down-regulation of sGC has been observed in aortic tissue of aged spontaneously hypertensive rats (4Kloess S. Bouloumie A. Mülsch A. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). On the other hand, an up-regulation of sGC expression was found in aortic tissue from nitroglycerin-tolerant rats (5Mülsch A. Oelze M. Klöss S. Mollnau H. Töpfer A. Smolenski A. Walter U. Stasch J.-P. Warnholtz A. Meinertz T. Münzel T. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2188-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and from rats suffering from chronic heart failure (6Bauersachs J. Bouloumie A. Fraccarollo D., Hu, K. Busse R. Ertl G. Circulation. 1999; 100: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), despite diminished vasodilator responses to NO. This apparently discrepant finding indicates that altered sGC expression does not necessarily translate into predictable changes in cGMP-dependent functional responses, but that other mechanisms, such as altered NO bio-availability, may overrun the influence of altered sGC expression. These findings exemplify the need for understanding the molecular mechanisms accounting for regulation of sGC expression. There is evidence that expression of sGC is controlled by second messenger cyclic nucleotides via a post-transcriptional mechanism: in various cells cyclic AMP-eliciting agonists decrease the expression of sGC mRNA and protein (7Shimouchi A. Janssens S.P. Bloch D.B. Zapol W.M. Bloch K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L456-L461PubMed Google Scholar, 8Papapetropoulos A. Marczin N. Mora G. Milici A. Murad F. Catravas J.D. Hypertension. 1995; 26: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) by a destabilization of the sGC mRNA. This effect is mimicked by activation of the cGMP signaling pathway,e.g. application of NO donors, stimulation of particulate guanyl cyclase by atrial natriuretic factor, and stimulation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase by the stable cGMP-analogue 8-chlorophenylthio-cGMP (9Ujiie K. Hogarth L. Danzinger R. Drewett J.G. Yuen P.S.T. Pang I.H. Star R.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 761-764PubMed Google Scholar). The objective of the present investigation was to characterize the mechanism accounting for sGCα1 mRNA destabilization induced by increased cGMP formation in isolated rat aorta. We observed that the elav family protein HuR (10Fan X.C. Steitz JA. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) stabilizes the sGCα1 mRNA by binding to AU-rich elements (ARE) in its 3′-untranslated region (UTR), and that an increase in intracellular cGMP strongly decreases HuR expression and sGCα1 mRNA binding activity, leading to accelerated mRNA degradation. The polyclonal chicken antibody directed against the α1 and β1 subunits of the rat lung sGC was produced by BioGenes GmbH (Berlin, Germany), which also provided the rabbit anti-chicken antibody. For some experiments an sGCα1-specific peptide antibody was obtained from Dr. Stasch, Bayer AG, Leverkusen. The oligonucleotides for RT-PCR, in vitro transcription, and gelshift analysis were synthesized by BioSpring GmbH and MWG-Biotech. 4H-8-Bromo-1,2,4-oxadiazolo(3,4-d)benz(b-1,4)oxazin-1-one (NS2028) was from Neurosearch (Copenhagen, Denmark). 3-(5′-Hydroxymethyl-2′-furyl)-1-benzyl indazole (YC-1) was a kind gift from Aventis Pharma (Strasbourg, France). The HuR-specific siRNA oligonucleotides were from Xeragon-Qiagen (Germantown, MD). Male normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (300 g) were obtained from Möllegaard (Skensved, Denmark) and were kept according to institutional guidelines, in compliance with German laws. The thoracic aorta was isolated from anesthetized rats (200 mg/kg ketamine (ExalgonTM), 100 mg/kg xylazine (RompunTM), cleaned from fat and connective tissue, and cut into rings of equal length (3 mm). The endothelium was removed by gentle forcing and rolling a glass rod through the lumen. The aortic rings were kept in culture dishes (six well) in MEM under a CO2-enriched atmosphere (4.5% CO2) at 37 °C. The rings were exposed to YC-1, NS2028, and/or actinomycin D for different periods of time and were then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Frozen tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen with porcelain mortar and a pestle. Total RNA was extracted by the modified guanidine isothiocyanate method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (11Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the sGCα1 mRNA (product size 826 bp), and elongation factor II (225 bp) was performed exactly as described previously (4Kloess S. Bouloumie A. Mülsch A. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ mRNA was purified from total RNA by means of the Messagemaker kit (Invitrogen). Total RNA (2 mg; 0.55 mg/ml) was denatured for 5 min at 65 °C. The salt concentration was adjusted to 0.5 m NaCl. Subsequently the RNA was incubated with the oligo(dT) cellulose suspension and heated for 10 min at 37 °C. After filtration the suspension was washed with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl and then with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl. The mRNA was eluted with RNase-free water. The poly(A)+ RNA sample was denatured for 15 min at 65 °C in 0.5× MOPS buffer containing 25% formamide, 1.1% formaldehyde, 1% Ficoll 400, 0.02% bromphenol blue (sodium salt). The mRNA was fractionated in a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and blotted overnight onto nylon membrane (pore size: 0.45 μm, Biodyne B, Pall) in 10× saline-sodium citrate (SSC) buffer solution (1.5 m NaCl, 150 mmsodium citrate, pH 7.5). Membranes were washed in 2× SSC, and the mRNA was fixed by UV-cross-linking. Subsequently the membranes were baked at 80 °C for 2 h and then pre-hybridized for 2 h in 50% formamide, 0.8 m NaCl, 0.1% Sarkosyl, 0.1% Ficoll 400, 0.1% polyvinyl pyrrolidone, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% SDS, and 250 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C. Hybridization occurred at 42 °C overnight in 10% dextran sulfate with biotinylated-DNA probes (5 ng/cm2) specific for elongation factor II and sGC α1 mRNA. Blots were then washed twice at 65 °C in 5× SSC, 0.5% SDS, washed for 30 min at 50 °C in 0.1× SSC, 1% SDS, and washed for 1 min with TBS-Tween 20 (0.05% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5). Afterward membranes were blocked for 1 h at 65 °C in TBS-Tween 20 containing 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated with a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (7 μl/100 cm2; 1:1000 in TBS-Tween 20) for 10 min at room temperature. The blots were washed twice in TBS-Tween 20 and then in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mmMgCl2, 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.5. Immunoreactive mRNA bands were visualized by chemiluminescence and exposure to x-ray film. Total RNA from rat lungs was used as a template for RT-PCR amplification of the 3′-UTR of sGCα1cDNA regions. A Pfu DNA polymerase (Pyrococcus furiosus DSM3638, 92 kDa, Promega) with 3′→5′ exonuclease (proofreading) activity was used for the PCR reaction. The 5′-sense primer contained the T7 promoter sequence 5′-CCAAGCTTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA-3′ (T7 ). For generating the 3UTRSK2 (424 bp) template, sense primer (5′-T7 CCAGCTACATCTTTGTGCC-3′) and antisense primer (5′-ACTGTCCTCTACAGTAGGC-3′), corresponding to positions 3049–3067 and 3423–3441 of the sGCα1 cDNA, were used (GenBankTM accession number U60835). Subsequently, PCR fragments encompassing the 3′-UTR of sGCα1 mRNA were synthesized bearing a T7sequence at the 5′-end. Biotinylation of transcripts was performed with the North2SouthTM Biotin in vitro transcription kit from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were carried out by a modification of the method of Wang (12Wang W. Caldwell M.C. Lin S. Furneaux H. Gorospe M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The oligoribonucleotide (3UTRSK2, 50–200 ng) was incubated with 40–100 μg of native nuclear extract (prepared according to Ref. 13Schini-Kerth V. Boese M. Busse R. Fisslthaler B. Mülsch A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) from endothelium-denuded rat aorta, and a 10× reaction buffer (15 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 600 mm KCl, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 50% glycerol, 30 mm MgCl2, 2 units/μl RNase inhibitors (40 units/μl, RNaseOUT, Invitrogen), 200 ng/ml total RNA) for 30 min at room temperature. Complexes were resolved by native 2% TAE-agarose gel electrophoresis (40 mm Tris pH 8.5, 0.1% acetic acid, 2 mm EDTA) for 2 h and blotted onto a nylon membrane (Biodyne B, Pall) overnight in 10× SSC. Blocking and detection of biotin-labeled bands was performed as described for Northern blots. For supershifts, 4–15 μg of the monoclonal HuR-antibody was incubated with the native nuclear extract for 1 h on ice before the specific riboprobe was added; all subsequent steps were performed as described for native gels. Total protein was precipitated (1.5 ml of 100% isopropanol) from the phenol-ethanol supernatant (TRIzol method) of the RNA extraction, and the precipitate was dissolved in 1% SDS. The protein (40 μg per lane) was fractionated on Laemmli gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose filters (Protrans; Schleicher & Schuell). The blots were blocked at 4 °C overnight and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with either a polyclonal chicken antibody (IgY) or a rabbit antibody (IgG) directed against the α1 subunits of sGC (1:100 dilution in blocking buffer). The blots were washed and then developed either with a peroxidase A-conjugated anti-chicken IgY (IgG, rabbit, 1:5,000 in blocking buffer) or anti-rabbit IgG (goat, 1:10,000). Immunoreactive peptides were visualized by chemiluminescence and exposure to x-ray film. The autoradiographs were analyzed by scanning densitometry. Equal protein loading and blotting was verified by α-actin immunostaining. An HuR-specific siRNA (HuR-siRNA) was designed by selecting a target region from base position 163 to 183 relative to the start codon, which fulfilled the specific sequence requirements as follows: AA(N19)dTdT (N is any nucleotide); 21-nt sense and 21-nt antisense strand; ∼50% G/C content; and a symmetric 2-desoxythymidine 3′ overhang. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized by Xeragon Oligonucleotides (Xeragon-Qiagen). The lyophilized siRNA was dissolved in sterile annealing buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm Hepes-KOH, 2 mm magnesium acetate, pH 7.4) to obtain a 20 μm solution. Then oligonucleotides were heated to 90 °C for 1 min followed by 1 h at 37 °C. In addition, we also used a HuR-siRNA targeting base position 564–584 relative to the start codon (kindly provided by S. Sengupta) for cell transfections. Lyophilized or dissolved siRNAs were stored at −20 °C. Cultured smooth muscle cells from rat aortas were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM, Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. SMCs were trypsinized, mixed with fresh MEM (plus antibiotics) without fetal calf serum, and seeded onto six-well plates (2 ml per well). 24 h later the cells had reached 80–90% confluence and were transfected with siRNA (final concentration, 100 nm) using the TransMessenger transfection reagent (TMTR; Qiagen). Therefore, 6 μg of siRNA was diluted with 12 μl of Enhancer R (ratio: micrograms of RNA to micrograms of Enhancer R, 1:2) and 168 μl of Buffer EC-R (Qiagen) and mixed by vortexing for 10 s. After incubation (5 min, room temperature) 24 μl of TMTR (ratio: micrograms of RNA to microliters of TMTR, 1:4) was added to the RNA-Enhancer R mixture. During this incubation (10 min, 15–25 °C) SMCs were washed with 2 ml (per well) of sterile Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen). Then the RNA-transfection mixture was diluted in 1.78 ml of MEM (plus antibiotics) and added dropwise to the cells (2 ml of transfection complex per well). The cells were cultured for 2 days at 37 °C (5% CO2). Thereafter the HuR and sGC mRNA and protein expression was assayed by RT-PCR and Western blot experiments. To assess the effect of increased cGMP formation on the sGCα1 subunit expression in rat aorta, freshly isolated endothelium-denuded aortic rings from Wistar Kyoto rats were kept under organ culture conditions, either in the absence (control ± 0.2% Me2SO) or presence of the sGC activator molecule YC-1 (10 μm), and the specific sGC inhibitor NS2028 (10 μm). After 24 h the vascular tissue was snap-frozen and homogenized in liquid nitrogen, then further processed for sGCα1 subunit mRNA and protein expression by RT-PCR (Fig. 1 A) and Western blot (Fig. 1 B), respectively. According to densitometric analysis of the RT-PCR product (Fig. 1 A) and the immunoreactive protein (α1 = 82 kDa, Fig. 1 B) the abundance of sGCα1 subunit mRNA and protein was markedly lower in YC-1-exposed aorta compared with controls (α1-mRNA = 93% lower, α1-protein = 56% lower versus controls;bar graphs; Fig. 1, A and B), whereas the levels of elongation factor II mRNA (Fig. 1 A) and α-actin protein (Fig. 1 B) were not affected by YC-1. In the presence of NS2028 the ability of YC-1 to decrease sGC subunit gene expression was almost completely blocked (Fig. 1, A andB). These findings show that long lasting activation of sGC in the rat aorta decreases sGCα1 subunit expression at the mRNA and protein level. To assess whether YC-1 affects the stability of sGCα1 mRNA, we investigated the time course of sGCα1 mRNA expression after inhibition of cell transcription by actinomycin D (Act D). The aortic rings were held in organ culture for 3, 6, or 9 h, in the presence of YC-1 (10 μm), or Act D (10 μm), or both. The tissue level of sGCα1 mRNA was estimated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. As illustrated by the fluorographs in Fig. 2 A and the densitometric analysis shown below, the level of sGCα1 mRNA did not decrease in Act d-exposed aortic rings for up to 9 h, indicating that the half-life of this mRNA exceeds 9 h when sGC is not activated. In contrast, in the presence of YC-1 and the absence of Act D, the sGCα1 mRNA levels decreased with a half-life of about 6 h. Preincubation (45 min) of the aortic rings with Act D prevented the YC-1-induced decrease of sGCα1 mRNA abundance (Fig. 2 A). The mRNA levels of elongation factor II remained stable for up to 9 h and were not affected by Act D and YC-1 (Fig. 2 A). These results suggest that YC-1 decreases the stability of sGCα1 mRNA by a mechanism requiring transcriptional activation of an unknown factor. The time course of YC-1-induced sGCα1 mRNA decay was mirrored by a quite similar time course of sGCα1 protein expression, as assessed by Western blots analysis (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the expression of α-actin was constant for the same period of time (Fig. 2 B). To further corroborate our finding of a YC-1-induced destabilization/accelerated degradation of sGCα1 mRNA in the rat aorta, we assessed the effect of a protein extract from YC-1-exposed rat aorta on the rate of sGCα1 mRNA degradation. Therefore, total native protein was isolated from a part of the aortic rings used in the previous experiments (Figs. 1 and 2), and 20 μg of protein was incubated at 37 °C with 1 μg of enriched poly(A)+ RNA isolated from rat lung (see “Materials and Methods”). After different periods of time (10–50 min (Fig. 3 A) or 15–45 min (Fig. 3 B)) an aliquot of the incubation mixture was probed for sGCα1 and elongation factor II mRNA by Northern blotting (see “Materials and Methods”). In the absence of aortic protein (control) the sGCα1 mRNA was stable for up to 50 min under these assay conditions (Fig. 3 A). In the presence of protein from aortas exposed to 0.2% Me2SO (solvent control), a moderate time-dependent decrease in sGCα1 mRNA abundance was observed (Fig. 3,A and B, “DMSO” lanes). The rate of sGCα1 mRNA decay was considerably accelerated by protein isolated from YC-1-exposed aortas (Fig. 3,A and B, “YC-1” lanes). In contrast, elongation factor II mRNA was quite stable even in the presence of protein from YC-1-exposed aorta (Fig. 3, A andB, lower autoradiographs), indicating that YC-1 specifically induced factors that led to accelerated decay of sGCα1 mRNA. The formation of these factors was apparently prevented by a preincubation of the aortas with Act D (Fig. 3 A) or NS2028 (Fig. 3 B), because under these conditions the aortic protein extract exhibited markedly less sGCα1 mRNA degrading activity. The 3′-UTR of the rat sGCα1mRNA bears several AUUUA motifs (AU-rich elements, AREs) (Fig. 4 A), which target the mRNA for rapid degradation by specific endonucleases (14Zhao Z. Chang F.-C. Fourneaux H.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2695-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and enable regulation of the mRNA stability by trans-acting factors (15Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). One specific protective factor is the RNA-binding protein HuR (34–38 kDa) (10Fan X.C. Steitz JA. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). To investigate whether HuR can interact with 3′-UTR of sGCα1 mRNA we synthesized a biotin-labeled oligoribonucleotide comprising bases 3049–3441 of the sGCα1 mRNA (3UTRSK2, 424 bp, Fig. 4) containing several AREs. This probe was incubated with native protein extracted from rat aorta. RNA-protein complex formation was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). The free probe migrated in two bands at the bottom (front) (Fig. 5, lane 1), very likely representing monomeric and oligomeric forms. In the presence of aortic protein the probe was retarded (shifted upwards), indicating interaction with a protein present in the extract. The extent of this shift was increased with increasing amount of protein added (Fig. 5,lanes 2 and 3). Addition of an 100-fold excess of an unlabeled synthetic ARE, [AUUUA]4, to the RNA-protein mixture prior to electrophoresis prevented the probe shift, indicating competition between the synthetic ARE and the truncated 3′-UTR of sGCα1 mRNA (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and5). When the aortic protein was preincubated (45 min, 4 °C) with a monoclonal HuR antibody, the RNA-protein band was further retarded (supershifted), demonstrating that HuR forms a complex with the ARE-containing sequence of sGCα1 mRNA (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 7).Figure 5HuR present in rat aortic nuclear extract binds to the 3′-UTR of sGC α1mRNA. RNA electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (RNA-EMSA) representative of two experiments. A biotin-labeled RNA probe (3UTRSK2, 424 bp, 250 ng) was incubated for 30 min with nuclear protein (40 and 80 μg) extracted from freshly isolated endothelium-denuded rat aorta (see “Materials and Methods”) then loaded and electrophoresed on a 6% TBE-acrylamide gel. The protein-RNA complexes were electroblotted onto a nylon membrane and visualized by chemiluminescence, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Lanes (fromleft to right): 1, free probe;2 and 3, probe-shift induced by 40 and 80 μg of rat aortic protein; 4 and 5, specific shift blocked by unlabeled competitor [AUUUA]4 probe (25 μg);6 and 7, supershift induced by a monoclonal HuR antibody (HuR-AB; 7.5 and 15 μg); and 8, negative control with aortic protein and HuR antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To clarify whether activation of sGC decreases HuR-like binding activity, endothelium-denuded rat aortic segments were kept for 12 h under organ culture conditions (see “Materials and Methods”), either in the absence or presence of YC-1 (100 μm), and NS2028 (100 μm), or the solvent control (0.2% Me2SO). Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from the vascular tissue, and the expression of HuR-like ARE binding activity was assessed by RNA-EMSA using the 3UTRSK2 probe. In the presence of protein (80 μg) from control aortas a similar bandshift as shown in Fig. 5 was observed (Fig. 6, lanes 2 and 3). The protein extract from Me2SO-treated aorta induced a quite similar shift (Fig. 6, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, with protein from YC-1-exposed aorta the shifted band markedly decreased (Fig. 6, lanes 6 and 7). This effect of YC-1 was prevented by concomitant exposure of the aorta to the sGC inhibitor NS2028 (Fig. 6, lanes 8 and 9). Addition of the monoclonal HuR antibody induced a strong supershift, which under these chromatographic conditions unfortunately superimposed with the shift (Fig. 6, lane 10). These findings indicate that YC-1 either induces a reduction of the HuR affinity for the 3′-UTR of GCα1 mRNA or down-regulates HuR expression. By Western blot analysis we assessed whether YC-1 affected HuR expression. Protein from rat aorta incubated with YC-1 and NS2028 as shown in Fig. 6 was loaded for SDS-PAGE analysis, blotted, and immunoprobed for HuR. The protein from the control and Me2SO-treated aortas showed a marked HuR-positive band at 34 kDa (Fig. 7 A, lanes 1–4 from left), similar to the nuclear extract from HeLa cells applied as a positive control (+contr.,lane 9). This band was significantly reduced (p > 0.05, ANOVA) in YC-1-treated aortas (lanes 5 and 6, and densitometric analysis shown below in Fig. 7 B). The sGC inhibitor NS2028 prevented the down-regulation of HuR expression by YC-1 (lanes 7 and 8). RNA interference allows targeted genes to be easily and efficiently “switched off,” using short stretches of double-stranded RNA that contain the same sequence as mRNA transcribed from the target gene (16Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). We used this approach to assess whether specific knockdown of HuR in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC) affects expression of sGC. Incubation of RASMC for 24 h with two different HuR siRNA oligonucleotides decreased HuR expression at the protein (Fig. 8 A, “siRNA”) and mRNA level (Fig. 8 B, “siRNA”). In the same cell extracts the expression of sGCα1 protein and mRNA was decreased as well (Fig. 8, A and B), compared with controls. Expression of actin protein (Fig. 8 A) and elongation factor II mRNA (Fig. 8 B) was not affected by HuR siRNA. This finding clearly shows that specific knockdown of HuR decreases sGCα1 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. The heterodimeric hemoprotein and NO receptor sGC is a key component of the NO/cGMP signal transduction pathway in vascular smooth muscle and other tissues. In addition to an acute regulation by positive (NO) or negative (superoxide radical) input signals (1Schmidt H.H.H.W. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 153-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) the activity of this pathway can also be controlled at the level of sGC expression (4Kloess S. Bouloumie A. Mülsch A. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown a feedback inhibition of sGC expression by its product cGMP (9Ujiie K. Hogarth L. Danzinger R. Drewett J.G. Yuen P.S.T. Pang I.H. Star R.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 761-764PubMed Google Scholar, 17Filippov G. Bloch D.B. Bloch K.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 18Liu H. Force T. Bloch K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6038-6043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This finding was related to an accelerated decay of the sGCα1 and β1 mRNA (17Filippov G. Bloch D.B. Bloch K.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We set out to reveal the mechanism accounting for the down-regulation of the sGCα1 subunit expression in response to sGC activation. Our rationale for studying sGCα1 was that in preliminary studies we found that this subunit was less expressed in rat vascular tissues than the β1 subunit and, therefore, formation of the NO-sensitive α1β1holoenzyme would be limited by the α1 subunit. A NO-independent activator of sGC, YC-1 (19Mülsch A. Bauersachs J. Schäfer A. Stasch J.-P. Kast R. Busse R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), was chosen here to avoid possible interference by cGMP-independent effects of NO on gene expression (20Hartsfield C.L. Alam J. Cook J.L. Choi A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L980-L988PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). The 3′-UTR of the rat sGCα1 mRNA bears several AUUUA-motifs (AU-rich elements, AREs) that are targeted by trans-acting factors for regulation of mRNA stability (15Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 22Levine T.D. Gao F. King P.H. Andrews L.G. Keene J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3494-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). One of these factors is the ubiquitous 34-kDa protein HuR, which binds to AREs with high affinity and selectivity (10Fan X.C. Steitz JA. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), thereby protecting the respective mRNA from accelerated decay (12Wang W. Caldwell M.C. Lin S. Furneaux H. Gorospe M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). By Western blot analysis we were able to show for the first time that HuR is constitutively expressed in the rat aorta. We provide evidence by in vitro mRNA degradation assay and RNA-EMSA that HuR protects the rat sGCα1 mRNA by binding to ARE present in the 3′-UTR. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that prolonged (12 h) sGC activation by YC-1 decreases the expression of HuR protein and HuR binding activity for sGCα1 mRNA. Consequently, the expression of the sGCα1 subunit was decreased at the mRNA and protein level. All these effects could be blocked by an inhibitor of YC-1-stimulated sGC activity, NS2028 (23Olesen S.P. Drejer J. Axelsson O. Moldt P. Bang L. Nielsen-Kudsk J.E. Busse R. Mülsch A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), indicating that they were caused by an increased sGC activity/cGMP formation. In this regard, sGC is not just another HuR-regulated gene but also a regulator of HuR expression, linking increased cGMP levels to depression of HuR activity and lower sGC expression. Although we did not investigate whether lowering of resting cGMP levels will increase HuR expression, our findings suggest the existence of a negative feedback loop formed by sGC and HuR. To confirm the hypothesis that a decrease in HuR expression induces a decrease in sGC expression, we used the RNA knockdown (RNA interference) technique (16Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). RNA interference is a gene-silencing mechanism that uses double-stranded RNA as a signal to trigger the degradation of the targeted mRNA. 48 h after transfection of cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells with a 21-mer double-stranded RNA, homologous to base position 163–183 relative to the start codon of the HuR message (HuR siRNA), we observed a strong decrease in HuR as well as in sGCα1 expression at the mRNA and protein level (Fig. 8). This experiment proves that down-regulation of sGC mRNA is a consequence of decreased HuR expression. The signaling cascade accounting for cGMP-dependent down-regulation of HuR could not be revealed in this study. Because concomitant application of Act D during exposure of the rat aorta to YC-1 prevented the down-regulation of HuR expression and binding activity, it is likely that cGMP induces the transcriptional activation of (unknown) factors that decrease HuR expression. Our preliminary data indicate that a cGMP-activated protein kinase and the transcription factor AP-1 are involved in down-regulation of HuR by sGC activators, 2S. Kloess and A. Mülsch, unpublished. but an in-depth study is required. AP-1 sites are present in the mouse HuR promoter region (24King P.H. Fuller J.J Nabors L.B. Detloff P.J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CREB sites were also found in this promoter region (24King P.H. Fuller J.J Nabors L.B. Detloff P.J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Agents that increase intracellular cyclic AMP decrease sGC subunit mRNA levels and cellular cGMP formation in response to NO-donor compounds (7Shimouchi A. Janssens S.P. Bloch D.B. Zapol W.M. Bloch K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L456-L461PubMed Google Scholar, 8Papapetropoulos A. Marczin N. Mora G. Milici A. Murad F. Catravas J.D. Hypertension. 1995; 26: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We observed that cyclic AMP-eliciting agonists decrease expression of HuR in rat aortic smooth muscle cells as well,2 suggesting that HuR also mediates the down-regulation of sGC in response to increased cAMP levels. It appears that HuR can integrate cyclic nucleotide second messenger signaling and translate changes in cAMP and cGMP levels in altered gene expression. This underscores the increasing importance of mRNA stability regulation for gene expression (25Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar), as compared with transcriptional regulation. In addition to sGC, other components of the NO/cGMP pathway are also regulated by altered mRNA stability. In human mesangial cells, which exhibit a smooth muscle cell-like phenotype, the expression of the cytokine-inducible NO synthase II is also down-regulated by NO and cGMP. Part of this negative modulation is caused by decreased mRNA stability (26Perez-Sala D. Cernuda-Morollon E. Diaz-Cazorla M. Rodriguez-Pascal F. Lamas S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F466-F473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′-UTR of NO synthase II also bears AREs, and HuR was shown to stabilize the NOS III mRNA by binding to several of these AREs. The expression of HuR in cytokine-exposed DLD1 cells (human intestinal epithelium) decreased concomitantly with enhanced NOS III-derived NO formation (27Rodriguez-Pascal F. Hausding M. Ihrig-Biedert I. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. Förstermann U. Kleinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26040-26049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an increase or decrease in HuR expression brought about by stable transfection with HuR-sense or -antisense vectors increased or decreased NO synthase II expression. Collectively, these examples and our present findings emphasize that several major components of the NO/cGMP pathway are controlled at a post-transcriptional level by HuR in a negative feedback manner. Future studies will be needed to reveal the relative importance of HuR-regulated mRNA stabilityversus transcriptional processes for NO/cGMP-dependent gene expression. We thank H.-P.

https://openalex.org/W2069201530,"We found that low concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl, <0.75 m) or urea (<1.5 m) enhanced the enzyme activity of lipocalin-type prostaglandin (PG) D synthase (L-PGDS) maximally 2.5- and 1.6-fold at 0.5 m GdnHCl and 1 m urea, respectively. The catalytic constants in the absence of denaturant and in the presence of 0.5 m GdnHCl or 1 m urea were 22, 57, and 30 min−1, respectively, and the K m values for the substrate, PGH2, were 2.8, 8.3, and 2.3 μm, respectively, suggesting that the increase in the catalytic constant was mainly responsible for the activation of L-PGDS. The intensity of the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum at 218 nm, reflecting the β-sheet content, was also increased by either denaturant in a concentration-dependent manner, with the maximum at 0.5 m GdnHCl or 1 m urea. By plotting the enzyme activities against the ellipticities at 218 nm of the CD spectra of L-PGDS in the presence or absence of GdnHCl or urea, we found two states in the reversible folding process of L-PGDS: one is an activity-enhanced state and the other, an inactive state. The NMR analysis of L-PGDS revealed that the hydrogen-bond network was reorganized to be increased in the activity-enhanced state formed in the presence of 0.5 m GdnHCl or 1 m urea and to be decreased but still remain in the inactive intermediate observed in the presence of 2 m GdnHCl or 4 m urea. Furthermore, binding of the nonsubstrate ligands, bilirubin or 13-cis-retinal, to L-PGDS changed from a multistate mode in the native form of L-PGDS to a simple two-state mode in the activity-enhanced form, as monitored by CD spectra of the bound ligands. Therefore, L-PGDS is a unique protein whose enzyme activity and ligand-binding property are biphasically altered during the unfolding process by denaturants.

Therefore, L-PGDS is a unique protein whose enzyme activity and ligand-binding property are biphasically altered during the unfolding process by denaturants. prostaglandin lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase guanidine hydrochloride catalytic constant dissociation constant cerebrospinal fluid aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage degree Lipocalin-type prostaglandin (PG)1 D synthase (L-PGDS, prostaglandin-H2D-isomerase, EC 5.3.99.2) is abundantly expressed in the central nervous system and male genitals of various mammals and in the human heart (1Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 259-271Google Scholar, 2Urade Y. Eguchi N. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68–69: 375-382Google Scholar). In these tissues, L-PGDS catalyzes the isomerization of PGH2, a common precursor of various prostanoids, to PGD2 in the presence of sulfhydryl compounds (3Urade Y. Fujimoto N. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12410-12415Google Scholar). PGD2 acts as a neuromodulator in the central nervous system, where it induces sleep and regulates body temperature, luteinizing hormone release, and pain responses (1Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 259-271Google Scholar, 2Urade Y. Eguchi N. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68–69: 375-382Google Scholar). In the peripheral tissues, PGD2 functions as a mediator of allergy and inflammatory responses (2Urade Y. Eguchi N. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68–69: 375-382Google Scholar, 4Matsuoka T.

Science. 2000; 287: 2013-2017Google Scholar). Sequence analyses and a homology search in data bases of protein primary structure have revealed that L-PGDS is a member of the lipocalin superfamily (1Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 259-271Google Scholar, 5Toh H. Kubodera H. Nakajima N. Sekiya T. Eguchi N. Tanaka T. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1067-1082Google Scholar), which is composed of various secretory lipid-transporter proteins, such as β-lactoglobulin, retinol-binding protein, major urinary protein, and bilin-binding protein (6Flower D.R. North A.C. Sansom C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 9-24Google Scholar). Lipocalin is a family of diverse proteins that normally serve for the storage or transport of physiologically important lipophilic ligands (6Flower D.R. North A.C. Sansom C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 9-24Google Scholar, 7Flower D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Google Scholar, 8Pervaiz S. Brew K. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 209-214Google Scholar). L-PGDS also has the ability to bind retinoids, bile pigments such as bilirubin and biliverdin, and thyroid hormones (9Tanaka T. Urade Y. Kimura H. Eguchi N. Nishikawa A. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15789-15795Google Scholar, 10Beuckmann C.T. Aoyagi M. Okazaki I. Hiroike T. Toh H. Hayaishi O. Urade Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8006-8013Google Scholar). Therefore, L-PGDS is a unique dual functional protein in the lipocalin family, acting as a PGD2-synthesizing enzyme and also as an extracellular transporter protein for lipophilic ligands. Despite their low mutual sequence homology, members of the lipocalin family share a conserved barrel of 8 antiparallel β-strands as their central folding motif; and the large cup-shaped hydrophobic cavity within the β-barrel and a loop scaffold at its entrance are well adapted to the task of ligand binding (11Monaco H.L. Zanotti G. Spadon P. Bolognesi M. Sawyer L. Eliopoulos E.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 695-706Google Scholar, 12Cowan S.W. Newcomer N.E. Jones T.A. Proteins. 1990; 8: 44-61Google Scholar, 13Böcskel Z.

The preliminary crystal structure analysis revealed that the tertiary structure of mouse recombinant L-PGDS also showed an 8-stranded β-barrel structure, and one free SH group because of Cys65 faced the inside of the hydrophobic cavity of the barrel structure (1Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 259-271Google Scholar). The enzyme activity of L-PGDS disappeared completely by chemical modification or replacement of the Cys65 residue with serine or alanine by site-directed mutagenesis (16Urade Y. Tanaka T. Eguchi N. Kikuchi M. Kimura H. Toh H. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1422-1428Google Scholar). Therefore, Cys65 is considered to play an important role as an active center for the catalytic function of L-PGDS. We recently found that the L-PGDS activity was enhanced in the presence of low concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) (17Inui T. Ohkubo T. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 641-646Google Scholar). In most cases, an enzyme is inactivated by denaturants at concentrations lower than those required for the complete unfolding (18Tsou C.-L. Science. 1993; 262: 380-381Google Scholar). However, a few enzymes have been reported to be activated instead. For example, adenylate kinase was reported to be activated in the presence of urea up to 1 m or up to 0.25 m GdnHCl (19Zhang H.-J. Sheng X.-R. Pan X.-M. Zhou J.-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 382-386Google Scholar). Dihydrofolate reductase also showed enhanced enzyme activity in the presence of urea up to 7 m (20Fan Y.X., Ju, M. Zhou J.M. Tsou C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 151-157Google Scholar, 21Fan Y.-X., Ju, M. Zhou J.-M. Tsou C.-I. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 97-102Google Scholar). By measuring the change in the fluorescence of 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid binding to adenylate kinase during denaturation and the activity change in dihydrofolate reductase during trypsin digestion in the presence of GdnHCl or urea, both groups of investigators suggested that the enzyme activation was caused by increased flexibility of the conformation at the enzyme active site. On the other hand, the mechanism of L-PGDS activation by denaturants has remained unclear. In this study, we investigated the unfolding process of L-PGDS in the presence of GdnHCl and urea by CD and NMR analyses combined with measurements of its synthase and ligand-binding activities. We found that two states were formed during the unfolding process, an activity-enhanced state at a low concentration of denaturants and an inactive intermediate at a higher concentration of denaturants. The enzyme activity was in good correlation with the amount of secondary structure, especially the amount of β-sheet structure. The ligand binding mode was also changed from a multistate mode for the native form of L-PGDS in the absence of denaturants to a two-state mode for the activity-enhanced form. The inactive intermediate still retained a secondary structure to maintain the folded core despite nearly complete loss of activity. Based on our findings, we propose a four-state equilibrium folding model for L-PGDS composed of the activity-enhanced and inactive states. GdnHCl, urea, SDS, and dithiothreitol were purchased from WAKO (Tokyo, Japan). Thrombin, bilirubin, and 13-cis-retinal were obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. The full-length cDNA for mouse L-PGDS, which is composed of 189 amino acid residues (GenBankTM accession number X89222 (22Hoffmann A. Bächner D. Betar N. Lauber J. Gross G. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 207: 332-343Google Scholar)), was ligated into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of the expression vector pGEX-2T plasmid (Amersham Biosciences). The N-terminal 22-amino acid residues of the signal peptide were deleted, and the C89A/C186A-, W43F-, and W54F-substituted recombinant enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α (TOYOBO, Tokyo, Japan). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). The DNA sequence were confirmed with a LI-COR model 4000L automated DNA sequencer (LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE) after cycle sequencing with a SequiTherm cycle sequencing kit (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI). The recombinant enzymes retained enzymatic activity comparable with that of the wild-type L-PGDS and is stable for long-term use. The mutated L-PGDS was expressed as a glutathione transferase fusion protein. The fusion protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with thrombin (100 units/100 μl) to release the L-PGDS. The recombinant protein was further purified to apparent homogeneity by Superdex 75 and Mono-Q column chromatographies. The purified protein was dialyzed against 5 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0). Patients with aneurysmal SAH, who were consecutively admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery, Nagoya City University Hospital, were treated with intravascular embolization of the aneurysmal dome by using detachable coils or surgically clipping of the dome within 24 h after the initial SAH attack. After the treatment of the aneurysms, a silicon drainage tube was placed in the lumbar CSF space for continuous draining of the subarachnoid clots into the CSF. Approximately 2 months after SAH, the normal CSF of patients (which does not contain blood) who developed communicating hydrocephalus was collected over 3 days. Informed consent was obtained from all patients to perform the lumbar puncture, which was part of the diagnostic workup. Human L-PGDS was purified from the CSF by immunoaffinity chromatography with the monoclonal antibody 1B7-conjugated column, as reported previously (23Oda H. Eguchi N. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Proc. Jpn Acad. 1996; 72: 108-111Google Scholar). Human L-PGDS was further purified to apparent homogeneity by Superdex 75 column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The L-PGDS activity was measured by incubating the enzyme at 25 °C for 1 min with [1-14C]PGH2 (final concentration of 40 μm) in 50 μl of 0.1 m Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mg/ml IgG and 1 mm dithiothreitol (16Urade Y. Tanaka T. Eguchi N. Kikuchi M. Kimura H. Toh H. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1422-1428Google Scholar). [1-14C]PGH2 was prepared from [1-14C]arachidonic acid (2.20 GBq/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (3Urade Y. Fujimoto N. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12410-12415Google Scholar). The CD spectrum of L-PGDS was measured with a spectropolarimeter model J-700 (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). The temperature of the solution in the cuvette was controlled at 4.0 ± 0.5 or 25.0 ± 0.5 °C by circulating water. The CD spectra were essentially the same between these two temperatures. The path length of the optical quartz cuvette was 1.0 mm for far-UV range CD measurements at 200 to 250 nm, and 10 mm for near-UV to visible range CD measurements at 250 to 600 nm. The protein solutions contained enzyme at 200 μg/ml, 5 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), and the appropriate amount of denaturant, bilirubin, or 13-cis-retinal. The data were expressed as molar residue ellipticity (θ). Various concentrations of bilirubin or 13-cis-retinal (10 μl) were added to L-PGDS in 990 μl of 5 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) to give a final concentration of 1.5 μm in the presence or absence of denaturant. Bilirubin was dissolved in Me2SO to give a 2 mm stock solution, and 13-cis-retinal in ethanol to give a stock solution of 1 mm. The concentrations of hydrophobic ligands were determined spectroscopically based on their respective molar absorption coefficients, i.e.ε453 in chloroform for bilirubin = 61,700m−1 cm−1 (24McDonagh A.F. Assisi F. FEBS Lett. 1971; 18: 315-317Google Scholar) and ε383 for 13-cis-retinal = 42,800m−1 cm−1 (25Robert S.H. Liu S.H. Asato A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 88: 506-516Google Scholar). After incubation at 25 °C for 60 min, the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was measured by an FP-750 spectrofluorometer (Jasco) with an excitation wavelength at 282 nm and an emission wavelength at 338 nm. The quenching of tryptophan fluorescence caused by nonspecific interactions with each ligand was corrected with 1.5 μm N-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide. The dissociation constant (K d) value for binding between ligand and L-PGDS was calculated by the method as described previously (26Levine R.L. Clin. Chem. 1977; 23: 2292-2301Google Scholar). Uniformly 15N-labeled protein was obtained by growing the transformed E. coli in M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source. Samples for NMR spectroscopy were dissolved in 90% H2O, 10% D2O-containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, and the protein concentrations were set at 2 mg/ml in 250 μl in a 5-mm microcell NMR tube (Shigemi Inc., Tokyo, Japan). 15N-1H heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence spectra (27Bax A. Griffey R.H. Hawkins B.L. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 55: 301-315Google Scholar) were measured with a Varian Unity Inova 500 spectrometer (Varian Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a triple resonance probe. Water suppression was achieved by solvent presaturation. Under the condition of pH 8.0, the time constant for intrinsic amide hydrogen exchange was about 10 ms, and so presaturation of the water signal obliterated the signals of rapidly exchanging protons in unstructured parts of the protein (28Molday R.S. Englander S.W. Kallen R.G. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 150-159Google Scholar). One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of L-PGDS were obtained in the absence or presence of 0.5, 2, or 6 m GdnHCl. Considering the protein solubility during the GdnHCl titration, we set the protein concentrations at 250 μg/ml. The temperature for NMR experiments was 30 °C. Phase-shifted sine-bell window functions, solvent-suppression filter on the time-domain data, and zero filling were applied before Fourier transformation. 1H chemical shifts were referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate and were measured with respect to acetone as an internal standard. The15N chemical shifts were measured relative to an external standard, NH4Cl. Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. The statistical significance between the control and the experimental group was assessed by Student's t test.p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. We investigated first the effects of denaturants, such as GdnHCl, urea, and SDS, on the enzyme activity of the C89A/C186A-substituted recombinant mouse L-PGDS. In the presence of 0.10–0.75 m GdnHCl or 0.25–1.50 murea, the PGDS activity was significantly enhanced (Fig. 1 A). At 0.5 mGdnHCl and 1 m urea, the enzyme activity reached its maximum of 2.5 ± 0.1 and 1.6 ± 0.1 μmol min−1 mg−1, respectively, which was 2.5- and 1.6-fold, respectively, higher than the activity in the absence of denaturants (1.0 ± 0.1 μmol min−1mg−1). The enzyme activity was reduced above 0.5m GdnHCl or 1 m urea in a concentration-dependent manner and became less than 5% of the control at 2 m GdnHCl or 4 m urea. Furthermore, the enzyme activity was completely recovered by the depletion of denaturants (data not shown), showing the reversibility of the denaturant effect on folding. On the other hand, the enzyme activity of L-PGDS was reduced by SDS in a concentration-dependent manner without any enhancement of the enzyme activity and reached less than 5% at 0.3% SDS (data not shown). These results show that the L-PGDS activity was enhanced by low concentrations of urea or GdnHCl, but not by SDS. The PGDS activity of human L-PGDS purified from CSF after SAH also was significantly enhanced in the presence of 0.1–1 m GdnHCl or 0.25–2 m urea. At 0.5 m GdnHCl and 1m urea, the enzyme activity reached its maximum, which was 3- and 1.7-fold, respectively, higher than the activity in the absence of denaturants. 2M. Emi, D. Irikura, T. Inui, and Y. Urade, unpublished observation. The enzyme activity was reduced above 0.5 m GdnHCl or 1 murea in a concentration-dependent manner and became less than 5% of the control at 3 m GdnHCl or 4 murea. These results showed that the activation of L-PGDS occurred in the presence of low concentrations of denaturants not only on the recombinant protein but on the native one. Next we determined the kinetic properties of the recombinant mouse L-PGDS in the absence or presence of denaturants (TableI). In the absence of denaturants, the apparent K m for PGH2 was 2.8 μm, and the catalytic constant (k cat) was calculated to be 22 min−1. In the presence of 0.5 m GdnHCl, theK m was 8.3 μm andk cat was 57 min−1 and in the presence of 1 m urea, the K m dropped to 2.3 μm and k cat rose to 30 min−1. These results suggest that the enhancement of L-PGDS activity in the presence of the low concentrations of denaturants was mainly because of the increase in the catalytic constant.Table IKinetic parameters and binding affinities of L-PGDS for lipophilic small ligands in the absence or presence of denaturantsDenaturantK mk catK dfor bilirubinK d for 13-cis-retinalμmmin −1nmμm(−)2.8221101.00.5 mGdnHCl8.3574501.21 mUrea2.3301201.1The kinetic properties of L-PGDS in the absence or presence of denaturants were calculated.

Data are expressed as the mean of three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab The kinetic properties of L-PGDS in the absence or presence of denaturants were calculated. The K d values were estimated by the fluorescence quenching data according to Levine (26Levine R.L. Clin. Chem. 1977; 23: 2292-2301Google Scholar). Data are expressed as the mean of three independent experiments. The conformational changes in the recombinant mouse L-PGDS in the presence of denaturants were investigated by measuring the CD spectra. Fig. 1 B shows the far-UV equilibrium CD spectra of L-PGDS in the absence or presence of 0.25, 1, 2.5, 4, and 6 m urea. The far-UV CD in the native state of L-PGDS showed a spectrum with an abundance of β-sheets (closed circle). By the treatment with 0.25 (open circle) or 1 (closed square)m urea, the absolute CD intensity was increased over a range of wavelengths from 206 to 230 nm, showing the augmentation of the secondary structure of L-PGDS. The secondary structure gradually disappeared by an increase in the urea concentration (2.5m, open square; 4 m, closed triangle) and was completely lost at 6 m urea (open triangle). A tight isosbestic point was observed at 230 nm on the CD spectra (arrow in Fig. 1 B) over the concentration range of urea up to 4 m, but not above 4m, thus showing 2 phases of the structural changes in L-PGDS. The CD spectra in the unfolding state of L-PGDS induced by GdnHCl (17Inui T. Ohkubo T. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 641-646Google Scholar) also showed an isosbestic point over the range up to 2m, but not above 2 m, giving almost the same propensity of the 2 phases of the unfolding process as those induced by urea. Furthermore, the structural reversibility was confirmed in the CD spectra by the depletion of GdnHCl or urea (data not shown). Fig. 1 C shows the equilibrium transition curves of L-PGDS obtained followed by treatment with GdnHCl and urea monitored at the wavelength of 218 nm, which reflects the content of β-sheet structure. The absolute intensity of CD at 218 nm was increased by 0.2–0.8 m GdnHCl and 0.25–1.75 m urea. The absolute intensity reached a maximum at 0.5 m GdnHCl or 1m urea, and decreased above 0.5 m GdnHCl or 1m urea in a concentration-dependent manner. Above 1 m GdnHCl or 2 m urea, the transition of L-PGDS was shown to occur in a biphasic manner, having a shoulder around 2 m GdnHCl or 3.5 m urea with respect to the formation of non-native state, as described later. To investigate the correlation between the enzyme activity and the content of β-sheet structure, we plotted the PGDS activities against the ellipticities of the CD spectra of L-PGDS at 218 nm in the presence or absence of GdnHCl or urea (Fig. 2). Nonlinear but ellipticity-dependent activation was observed in the presence of GdnHCl up to 0.5 m or urea up to 1m (solid lines). After showing the maximum activity at the ellipticities of −9.2 and −8.7 × 103 deg cm2 dmol−1 in the presence of 0.5 m GdnHCl and 1 m urea, respectively, the PGDS activity decreased linearly in an ellipticity-dependent manner with a horizontal intercept at approximately −5 × 103 deg cm2dmol−1 ellipticity in the presence of 2 mGdnHCl and 4 m urea (dotted lines). Although the slopes of the linear phase were different between GdnHCl and urea, the enzyme activity was highly dependent on the ellipticity at 218 nm. When the ellipticity was higher than −5.0 × 103 deg cm2 dmol−1, however, the enzyme activity was below the detection limit. These results, taken together, show that the unfolding of L-PGDS in the presence of denaturants proceeded via two states, i.e. an activity-enhanced one and an inactive one. Table II summarizes the contents of the secondary structure of L-PGDS of the native state in the absence of denaturants and those of the activity-enhanced state in the presence of low concentrations of denaturants calculated from the CD spectra by the method of Chen et al. (29Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Google Scholar). The native L-PGDS was composed of 17% α-helix, 45% β-sheet, and 38% coil. The secondary structure contents of L-PGDS are similar to those of β-lactoglobulin, a member of the lipocalin family, estimated from both CD spectra and x-ray crystallography (30Kuwajima K. Yamaya H. Sugai S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 806-822Google Scholar). In the presence of 0.5 m GdnHCl or 1 m urea, the β-sheet content increased from 45 to 51 or 50%, respectively, whereas the coil contents decreased from 38 to 32 or 32%, respectively, without any changes in the α-helical structures. The secondary structure contents of the inactive intermediate in the presence of 2 m GdnHCl or 4m urea could not be calculated, because of the highly deviated CD spectra.Table IIContents of secondary structure of L-PGDS calculated from the CD spectraDenaturantα-Helixβ-SheetCoil%(−)1745380.5 mGdnHCl1751321 mUrea185032The contents of secondary structure elements of L-PGDS were estimated by the method of Chen et al.

Open table in a new tab The contents of secondary structure elements of L-PGDS were estimated by the method of Chen et al. (29Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Google Scholar). We then recorded the15N-1H heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence spectra of the recombinant mouse L-PGDS in the absence or presence of 0.5 and 2 m GdnHCl or 1 and 4 m urea to detect the signals of amide protons slowly exchanging with the hydrogen bond (Figs. 3,A-E). In the 15N-1H heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence spectrum, the positions of several cross-peaks were changed in the activity-enhanced state of L-PGDS formed in the presence of 0.5 m GdnHCl or 1m urea (Fig. 3, B and C), whereas their intensities were close to those observed in the spectrum without denaturants. In addition, new cross-peaks were observed in the spectrum of the activity-enhanced state (arrowheads in Fig. 3,B and C), indicating that the hydrogen-bond network in the L-PGDS molecule was reorganized by these denaturants. The number of observed cross-peaks was drastically decreased but still remained in the inactive state in the presence of 2 mGdnHCl (Fig. 3 D) or 4 m urea (Fig. 3 E). This phenomenon is interpreted as the loss of hydrogen bonds, and is typical of the denaturation process. We also determined one-dimensional proton NMR spectra to obtain useful gross information on the conformational status of the two equilibrium states of L-PGDS in the absence and presence of 0.5 to 6 mGdnHCl (Fig. 4). One-dimensional1H NMR spectra of L-PGDS in the absence or presence of 0.5m GdnHCl were well dispersed, which reflect the compact folded states of the protein. These features were notably evident in the amide and aromatic (7.5 to 10.0 ppm, Fig. 4 A) and the aliphatic (0.5 to 3.0 ppm, Fig. 4 B) regions of the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of the protein. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of L-PGDS in the presence of 2 m GdnHCl showed limited chemical shift dispersion in the1H dimension, which reflects the overall similarity to an unfolded state in the presence of 6 m GdnHCl (Fig. 4,A and B). To investigate the binding affinity of the activity-enhanced state of L-PGDS for small lipophilic ligands, we measured the fluorescence quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan residue of L-PGDS in the presence or absence of 1 m urea or 0.5m GdnHCl after incubating the enzyme with various concentrations of bilirubin or 13-cis-retinal. The recombinant mouse L-PGDS in the absence of these denaturants showed fluorescence quenching in a concentration-dependent manner after addition of bilirubin or 13-cis-retinal (Fig. 5 A). The fluorescence intensity in the presence of an excess amount of bilirubin (above 2 μm) or 13-cis-retinal (above 6 μm) decreased below 10 and 30% of the fluorescence intensity in the absence of lipophilic ligands, respectively. In the presence of 1 m urea, bilirubin and 13-cis-retinal showed fluorescence quenching curves almost identical to those in the absence of urea (Fig. 5 B). However, in the presence of 0.5 m GdnHCl (Fig. 5 C), L-PGDS required higher concentrations of bilirubin to quench the fluorescence by an amount comparable with that in the absence of GdnHCl, whereas the fluorescence quenching curve with 13-cis-retinal was almost identical to that in the absence of denaturants. The calculated K d values obtained by the method of Levine (26Levine R.L. Clin. Chem. 1977; 23: 2292-2301Google Scholar) are also summarized in Table I. In the presence of 1m urea, the binding affinity of L-PGDS for bilirubin (K d = 120 nm) was almost identical to that in the absence of denaturant (K d = 110 nm). However, the affinity in the presence of 0.5m GdnHCl (K d = 450 nm) was significantly lower than that in the absence of denaturants. In the case of 13-cis-retinal, the K d values were estimated to be 1.0 μm in the absence of denaturants, 1.1 μm in the presence of 1 murea, and 1.2 μm in the presence of 0.5 mGd"
https://openalex.org/W2036050290,"We have used a proteomic approach using mass spectrometry to identify signaling molecules involved in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. Using affinity purification by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to enrich for tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, we have identified a novel signaling molecule in the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway. This molecule, designated Odin, contains several ankyrin repeats, two sterile alpha motifs and a phosphotyrosine binding domain and is ubiquitously expressed. Using antibodies against endogenous Odin, we show that it undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation upon addition of growth factors such as EGF or PDGF but not by cytokines such as IL-3 or erythropoietin. Immunofluorescence experiments as well as Western blot analysis on subcellular fractions demonstrated that Odin is localized to the cytoplasm both before and after growth factor treatment. Deletion analysis showed that the phosphotyrosine binding domain of Odin is not required for its tyrosine phosphorylation. Overexpression of Odin, but not an unrelated adapter protein, Grb2, inhibited EGF-induced activation of c-Fos promoter. Microinjection of wild-type or a mutant version lacking the PTB domain into NIH3T3 fibroblasts inhibited PDGF-induced mitogenesis. Taken together, our results indicate that Odin may play a negative role in growth factor receptor signaling pathways."

We show that plasma membrane of insect hemocytes and of mammal red blood cells is the first target of this toxin. Electrophysiological and pharmacological approaches indicate that the initial effect of αX on macrophage plasma membrane is an increase of monovalent cation permeability, sensitive to potassium channel blockers. As a consequence, several events can occur intracellularly, such as selective vacuolation of the endoplasmic reticulum, cell swelling, and cell death by colloid-osmotic lysis. These effects, inhibited by potassium channel blockers, are totally independent of Ca2+. However, the size of the pores created by αX on macrophage or red blood cell plasma membrane increases with toxin concentration, which leads to a rapid cell lysis.

The basis of this infectivity is still poorly understood, although Photorhabdus luminescens was shown to have an oral insecticidal activity (4Bowen D. Rocheleau T.A. Blackburn M. Andreev O. Golubeva E. Bhartia R. ffrench-Constant R.H. Science. 1998; 280: 2129-2132Google Scholar) because of entomotoxic proteins (5Bowen D.J. Insign J.C. Appl. Environ.

Other insecticidal toxins active after injection are also produced by P. luminescens (7Daborn P.J. Waterfield N. Silva C.P., Au, C.P.Y. Sharma S. ffrench-Constant R.H. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10742-10747Google Scholar). Genes coding for similar entomotoxins were cloned in Xenorhabdus nematophila (8ffrench-Constant R.H. Bowen D.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 828-833Google Scholar), and various cytotoxic factors were identified in bacterial broth growth of this species (9Ribeiro C. Duvic B. Oliveira P. Givaudan A. Palha F. Simöes N. Brehélin M. J. Insect Physiol. 1999; 45: 677-685Google Scholar, 10Brillard J. Ribeiro C. Boemare N. Brehélin M. Givaudan A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2515-2525Google Scholar). Some of these factors are cytotoxic in vitro for insect immunocompetent cells and also have hemolytic activity on mammal red blood cells. Interestingly, all these cytotoxic and hemolytic activities are absent in P. luminescens broth growth (10Brillard J. Ribeiro C. Boemare N. Brehélin M. Givaudan A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2515-2525Google Scholar), suggesting differences in the mode of virulence of these two related entomopathogenic bacteria species. We know that these toxins have very little homology with known sequences and represent a new class of toxins (8ffrench-Constant R.H. Bowen D.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 828-833Google Scholar). The first aim of this work was to study the mode of action of one of these new toxins on its cellular targets. InX. nematophila the existence of toxins active both on red blood cells and on hemocytes allows us to study the mode of action of these molecules on mammal cells and on insect cells. Two different hemolytic activities were identified that appear sequentially in the course of bacterial growth (10Brillard J. Ribeiro C. Boemare N. Brehélin M. Givaudan A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2515-2525Google Scholar). The earliest hemolytic activity (activity C1) appears in broth growth when bacteria culture reaches the stationary phase. It lyses sheep red blood cells (SRBC)1 but is inactive on rabbit red blood cells (RRBC) and is heat sensitive (30 min at 60 °C). It is under the control of flhDC, the flagellar master operon of X. nematophila (11Givaudan A. Lanois A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 107-115Google Scholar). The second hemolytic activity (activity C2) appears late in the stationary phase, is heat resistant (one hour at 100 °C), active on RRBC, inactive on SRBC, and is not under the control of flhDC. Insertional inactivation of theflhDC gene in X. nematophila leads both to loss of C1 activity (C2 is maintained) and to a very attenuated virulence phenotype. Because X. nematophila septicemia arises in the insect body, it is obvious that this bacteria is able to escape defense reactions and especially phagocytosis. The means by which entomopathogenic bacteria escape the defense reactions of insects is totally unknown. Hemocytes, the free cells in hemolymph, are the major immunocompetent cells in insects. Phagocytosis is mainly achieved by macrophage-like cells that belong to the morphotype “granular hemocyte 1” (GH1) (12Brehélin M. Zachary D. Brehélin M. Immunity in Invertebrates. Springer Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York1986: 36-48Google Scholar). As GH1 are one of the targets of the cytotoxic activities evidenced in X. nematophila broth growth (10Brillard J. Ribeiro C. Boemare N. Brehélin M. Givaudan A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2515-2525Google Scholar), these activities appear to be good candidates for supporting, at least in part, the immunosuppressive effect. In the present work we report the purification of the flhDC-controlled lysin. The mode of action of this lysin was studied on SRBC and on insect hemocytes. We show that insect macrophages (GH1) were the most sensitive hemocytes to the lysin and that this hemolysin was not recycled to react with multiple target cells but works as a porin. Finally, the swollen appearance of hemocytes incubated with flhDC-controlled lysin prompted us to check for activity of this lysin on cell membrane permeability. We provide evidence that monovalent cation channels and larger pores are opened in the plasma membrane of the insect macrophages, leading to plasma membrane depolarization and cell death through colloid-osmotic lysis independent of Ca2+ movements. X. nematophila (strain F1, phase variant I, laboratory collection) were grown in Luria Bertani broth at 28 °C. In these conditions the maximum production of flhD-dependent cytotoxic activity (C1) (10Brillard J. Ribeiro C. Boemare N. Brehélin M. Givaudan A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2515-2525Google Scholar) was reached in 20-h-old cultures. A purification of the factor responsible for this activity was achieved from this C1 culture supernatant. Broth growth was centrifuged (30 min at 12,000 × g). The supernatant was immediately precipitated in 50% ammonium sulfate and centrifuged, and the supernatant was precipitated in 70% ammonium sulfate. The 70% pellet was dissolved and dialyzed against water, concentrated by lyophilization, and dissolved in low ionic strength buffer (phosphate buffer 10 mm, pH 7.8). This solution was submitted to chromatography on HiTrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences), and elution was achieved with NaCl. Positive fractions, as assayed by measuring SRBC hemolysis and insect hemocyte lysis, eluted at 150 mm NaCl were pooled, lyophilized, dissolved in water, and applied on a C18 reverse phase HPLC column. Active fractions, collected in a single and isolated peak, were immediately lyophilized. Before use, they were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or HEPES buffer. In this study PBS contained 1 mm CaCl2and 2 mm MgCl2, unless otherwise stated. The titer of the lysin solution was evaluated by its hemolytic activity on SRBC (see below). Heat resistance was measured by incubating for 30 min at 60 °C prior to testing for cytotoxic and hemolytic activities. For trypsin resistance, fractions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 30 units of trypsin (Sigma). Larvae of the common cutworm Spodoptera littoralis (lepidoptera) were reared with a photoperiod of 12 h on artificial diet at 24 °C. Three-day-old sixth instar larvae were selected and surface-sterilized with 70% (v/v) ethanol prior to collection of hemolymph in test tubes filled with anticoagulant buffer (62 mm NaCl, 100 mm glucose, 10 mmEDTA, 30 mm trisodium citrate, 26 mm citric acid; see Ref. 13Mead G.P. Ratcliffe N.A. Renwrantz L. J. Insect Physiol. 1986; 13: 167-177Google Scholar) at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the hemocyte pellet was rinsed in PBS and resuspended in the same saline. 20 μl of hemocyte suspension were layered on glass coverslips. Hemocytes were allowed to adhere on glass for 15 min in a moist chamber at 23 °C and then gently rinsed with PBS before being used as monolayers. Cytotoxic activity was tested on monolayers. Excess PBS was pipetted off the coverslip, replaced by 20 μl of the solution of lysin in PBS, and monolayers were incubated in a moist chamber at 23 °C. Hemocyte mortality was checked by adding 2 μl of trypan blue dye (0.04% final in PBS) and 5 min more of incubation. In a preliminary experiment, results were expressed as a percentage of mortality in total hemocyte population. In the other experiments, cytotoxic activity was expressed as percentage of dead cells among the GH1 population. When potassium channel inhibitors tetraethylammonium (TEA) and tetrabutylammonium (TBA) were used, they were added to a solution of the lysin in HEPES buffer (pH 7.2) at concentrations of 50–300 mm. Results were expressed as percentage of dead cells in the GH1 population. Osmolarity was measured in an automatic micro-osmometer (H. Roebling, Messtechnik, Berlin). The role of Ca2+ ions was tested after extensive dialysis of lysin against PBS without Ca-Mg. Monolayers were prepared in the same buffer after rinsing hemocytes several times in anticoagulant buffer (deprived of Ca-Mg and with EDTA). Sheep red blood cells were provided by BioMérieux (Lyon, France) at 50% suspension. Before use, SRBC were extensively washed in PBS and adjusted to 5% suspension in this buffer. Tests were performed by using 50 μl of SRBC suspension to which 100 μl of the lysin solution were added. Incubation lasted 2 h at 37 °C. Then the suspension was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min. 130 μl of the supernatant were added to 770 μl of pure water, and absorbance was determined at 540 nm. One unit of hemolytic activity (1 HU) was defined as the OD measured after total hemolysis of 50 μl of a 5% SRBC suspension in 900 μl of distilled water. Hemolytic titer of a solution was calculated using the formula deduced from numerous absorbance determinations with serial dilutions of lysin: Titer (HU) = 210(OD-0.72). In some experiments, TBA (final concentrations 100–300 mm) was added to red blood cell suspensions in HEPES buffer before incubations with hemolysin. Red blood cell ghosts were obtained after 5 min of incubation of one volume of a 5% red blood cell suspension in PBS and 5 volumes of distilled water. Lysed red blood cells were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 5 min), rinsed two times in distilled water, and then four times in PBS. For inhibition of hemolytic activity, lysin solutions were incubated with large amounts of ghost suspensions for 2 h at 37 °C and then centrifuged and tested for hemolytic activity. In a first series of experiments, 100 μl of different concentrations of lysin in PBS (see “Results”) were incubated with 50 μl of a 5% suspension of SRBC at 37 °C; absorbance of supernatant was determined from 0.5–24 h. In a second series of experiments, a constant amount of lysin was incubated for 2 h with increasing SRBC concentrations (5%, 10, and 20%), and the percentage of hemolysis was determined for each red blood cell concentration. Using the procedure described by Szaboet al. (14Szabo I. Brutsche S. Tombola F. Moschioni M. Satin B. Telford J.L. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Papini E. Zoratti M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5517-5527Google Scholar), hemocyte monolayers were prepared in 24-well tissue culture plates (106 cells per well) and incubated in PBS for 30 min at 24 °C with or without lysin at a titer that allowed vacuolation of the cells (max. 0.02 HU) but gave a low percentage of lysis in time of the experiment (30 min). Data were expressed as percentage of neutral red uptake values obtained in controls (no lysin treatment). Intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured with fluorescent indicator fura-2 (15Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar). For this purpose, insect hemocyte monolayer was prepared on either rectangular (20 × 7 mm) or square (10 × 10 mm) glass coverslips. After plating, cells were loaded with fura-2 after incubation for 30 min at room temperature with the extracellular solution: 124 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 26 mm NaHCO3, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 1.5 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 10 mmd-glucose (bubbled with O2/CO2, 95:5) containing 5 μm of fura-2AM and 0.02% Pluronic. [Ca2+]i was monitored either by spectrofluorimetry or videomicroscopy. After rinsing, a rectangular coverslip was inserted in the quartz cuvette of a Aminco-Bowman 2 spectrofluorimeter (SLM Instruments) with an angle of 45° respective to the excitation beam. The toxin was applied directly in the quartz cuvette containing the extracellular solution, magnetically stirred, and thermostated at 25 °C. Fura-2 fluorescence was obtained by excitation of the preparation alternatively at 340 and 380 nm and by monitoring emissions (F 340 andF 380) at 510 nm. The ratio of emissions at 510 nm (F 340/F 380) was recorded every 0.5 s. Alternatively, a square coverslip was transferred to the recording chamber mounted on an inverted microscope (Leica, DMIRB). Fura-2 emission was obtained by exciting alternatively at 340 and 380 nm with a rotating filter wheel (Sutter Instruments). Fluorescent signals were collected with a CCD camera (Hamamatsu), digitized, and analyzed with an image analysis software (“Acquacosmos,” Hamamatsu). To record K+ efflux from insect hemocyte, intracellular K+ concentration was measured with fluorescent K+-binding benzofuran isophtalate dye (or PBFI). For this purpose, cells were plated on a square (10 × 10 mm) glass coverslip and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 5 μm of PBFI-AM and 0.02% Pluronic diluted in the extracellular solution. After rinsing, the coverslip was transferred to the stage of an inverted microscope (Leica DMIRB). PBFI fluorescence was obtained by exciting the preparation at 380 nm and was collected at 510 nm. Analysis and digitization were performed as described above. For electrophysiological recordings, insect hemocyte monolayers were prepared on square (10 × 10 mm) glass coverslips. After plating, a coverslip was transferred to the recording chamber of an inverted microscope (IMT2, Olympus), continuously superfused (flow rate: 5 ml/min) with the extracellular solution described above and containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) at room temperature. Patch-clamp experiments were performed in the cell-attached and the inside-out configurations with glass microelectrodes (4–5 MΩ resistance). According to the experiment, electrodes were filled with various solutions: the extracellular solution (as described above), potassium-rich solutions comprising 150 mm potassium gluconate and 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) or 150 mm potassium chloride and 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), a TEA-based solution containing 150 mm TEA chloride and 50 mm HEPES, and a TBA-based solution composed of 150 mm TBA chloride and 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). For both cell-attached and inside-out experiments, the toxin αX was used at a concentration of 0.062 HU either diluted in the intra-electrode solution or bath-applied, respectively. Recordings were performed in the voltage clamp mode (Vcmd); command voltage refers to the voltage applied in the recording electrode. Transmembrane voltage (Vm) recorded in the cell-attached configuration equals Vi−Vcmd, where Vi is the voltage of the inner face of the patch (16Ogden D. Stanfield P.R. Ogden D. Microelectrode Techniques: The Plymouth Workshop Handbook. 2nd Ed. Cambridge Company of Biologists, Cambridge1994: 53-79Google Scholar). On graphs, only Vcmd is given because Vi is not known. The voltage-dependence of the currents recorded in the presence of αX in the cell-attached mode was studied by stepping Vcmd from −80 to +80 mV with an increment of 20 mV. In this protocol, each voltage step lasted 2 s. Single channel currents were recorded with a patch-clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200 B, Axon Instruments) and digitized (Digidata 1200 Interface, Axon Instruments). Signals were filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. Continuous recording and analysis of the currents were performed with John Dempster's softwares ‘WinCDR’ and ‘WinWCP.‘ Possible osmotic protection of insect hemocytes and SRBC was tested with protectants of different sizes: polyethylene glycol 6,000 and 4,000 and dextran 1,000, all at 30 mm, and raffinose (MW 504) and sucrose (MW 342), both at 50 mm. These protectants were added to the lysin solutions, and hemocytes or red blood cells were incubated as described above. In a series of experiments, after incubation and measurement of the optical density of the supernatant (hemolysis), the red blood cell pellet was resuspended and incubated 5 min more in PBS and measured again for hemolysis. For cytolysis, two series of monolayers were incubated with lysin and protectant. In one series, the percentage of macrophage lysis was determined at the end of incubation. In the other series, at the end of incubation monolayers were washed and incubated 5 min more in PBS. Then the percentage of lysis was determined and compared with that obtained without rinsing the cells. Hemocyte monolayers were incubated for 0.5 h with lysin diluted in PBS (titer 0.02 HU) or in PBS for control, fixed in 5% glutaraldehyde, then in 1% osmium tetroxide, and embedded in Epon. Ultra-thin sections were stained according to Reynolds (17Reynolds E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 208-212Google Scholar). Purification of the lysin was achieved as described under “Experimental Procedures” and is summarized in Table I. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis of the C18 active fraction gives only one peak with a MW of 10,790. The profile mass fingerprint (PMF) after trypsin digestion of this molecule was determined (thanks to N. Galeotti, P. Marin, and E. Demay from Centre CNRS INSERM de Pharmacologie et Endocrinologie, Montpellier, France). This PMF was used to search protein data bases, but the analysis did not yield any protein identification. We called this lysin α-Xenorhabdolysin (αX). It was hemolytic for SRBC but not for RRBC (Table II).Table IPurification of α-Xenorhabdolysin from bacteria culture mediumPurification stepsVol. (ml)Act./100 μlTotal act.YieldCrude extract6200.53100 /Pption-dialysis1910.4198464%HiTrap Q718.1127141%C180.916144 4.6%Pption-dialysis: precipitation at 50–70% ammonium sulfate, pellet dissolved in water and dialyzed against 10 mm phosphate buffer.

With αX solutions of 0.02 HU or more, death of the hemocytes occurred by necrosis, as tested by trypan blue uptake, in less than one hour. The main hemocyte types, which are plasmatocytes (Pl) and Granular Hemocytes 1 (GH1, insect macrophages), were unequally sensitive, with GH1 showing a higher percentage of lysis than Pl did for the same αX titer (not shown). Therefore, most of the numerations reported in this study were achieved on GH1 alone. Before lysis, Pl and GH1 exhibited extensive vacuolation (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting a modification of plasma membrane permeability by the toxin. Neutral red uptake quantification did not show any significant difference between vacuolated cells and untreated hemocytes (not shown). Transmission electron micrograph of αX-treated cells showed the presence of numerous ribosomes on the cytoplasmic side of the vacuole membrane. These vacuoles were dilated endoplasmic reticulum cisternae and perinuclear cisterna (Fig. 2). Other cellular organelles, especially mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, or lysosomes appeared only very slightly altered, if any.Figure 2αX triggers endoplasmic reticulum vacuolation in insect hemocyte (0.02 HU for 30 min).Vacuoles are dilated vesicles of rough endoplasmic reticulum (er) or nuclear cisterna (arrow).

The lytic effects on hemocytes and on SRBC were still observed in a non-added calcium medium (Table II). The absence of Ca2+ did not alter the difference in sensitivity between plasmatocytes and granular hemocytes 1 to αX (not shown). To test for the possible recycling of αX after a first exposure to cells, we conducted three kinds of experiments. In the first series, a suspension of SRBC was incubated with different dilutions of αX (Fig. 3). Incubations lasted up to 24 h with a measurement of OD at different incubation times. In these experiments we observed an increase of hemolysis up to 2 h, and then the OD reached a plateau value. Such long term incubations were not performed with insect hemocytes. In the second series of experiments, increasing SRBC concentrations (5–20%) were incubated for 2 h in 0.2 or 0.05 HU of αX. Fig. 4 shows that the percentage of hemolysis elaborated decreased with increasing target cell concentration. In the last series of experiments, different dilutions of αX were first incubated with SRBC ghosts, and then the supernatant was further incubated with a 5% suspension of SRBC or with S. littoralis hemocyte monolayers. Neither hemolytic nor cytolytic activity was detected (Table II). We have investigated whether potential toxin-mediated modifications of membrane permeability could result in a change in hemocyte Ca2+ and K+ cytosolic concentrations. To record [Ca2+]ichanges, fura-2-loaded cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of αX (0.032–0.25 HU), and the fluorescence ratio 340/380 of the hemocyte monolayer was recorded at 510 nm in a spectrofluorimeter. Toxin at all these concentrations led to cell death. At a concentration of 0.25 HU, a transient rise in [Ca2+]i could be recorded that was apparently regulated quickly. Lower concentrations of toxin, ranging from 0.062 to 0.032 HU, led to a dose- and time-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 5 A). In a Ca2+- free external medium (no added Ca2+), the toxin at a concentration of 0.25 HU had almost no detectable effects. Therefore, this suggests that the toxin-induced [Ca2+]i rise results from a Ca2+ influx from the external medium (Fig. 5 A). The analysis of the fura-2 emissions at 510 nm, obtained by exciting at 340 (F340) and 380 nm (F380), indicates that although the initial increase in fluorescence ratio in the presence of αX was effectively because of an increase in [Ca2+]i as indicated by the variations of fura-2 emissions in opposite directions (Fig. 5 B), the decrease of fluorescence ratio more likely reflects leakage and dilution of the probe in the medium because both F340 and F380 decrease in parallel. The toxin at 0.062 HU elicits rapid and unregulated increases in [Ca2+]iin visually identified GH1 and plasmatocytes, as observed using videomicroscopy (Fig. 5 C). Observation in phase contrast microscopy of these cells during the experiment confirms that the cells were lysed at the time of [Ca2+]irise (Fig. 5 D). Because the toxin is able to induce cell death in the absence of external calcium, it can be postulated that the increase in [Ca2+]i detected upon exposure of cells to the toxin is not responsible for its toxicity but more likely reflects ionic disturbance across cell membrane and cell lysis. Cytoplasmic concentration of K+ was monitored in PBFI-loaded hemocytes. At each αX (0.02 HU) application to the medium, an immediate loss of K+ could be recorded that was in part regulated up to the cell lysis. This lysis was evidenced by a large decrease in PBFI fluorescence, revealing leakage of the probe in the medium as illustrated in three visually identified GH1 (Fig. 5 E). From the videomicroscopy data, one can hypothesize that αX mediates to an ionic imbalance, leading to cell death. This imbalance could initially be because of a K+ efflux. Therefore, using patch-clamp recordings we have examined whether αX could alter K+ ion permeability through native GH1 membranes. In a first attempt to study membrane modifications elicited by the toxin, conventional patch-clamp whole cell recordings (WCRs) were undertaken in visually identified GH1. It must be mentioned that experiments were conducted only within 90 min following hemocyte plating. Indeed, the hemocytes would naturally deteriorate after 90 min and give unreliable data. Stable WCRs were almost impossible to get from GH1 because these cells sealed almost immediately after obtaining a gigaohm seal and ruptured the patch by applying a negative pressure (n = 20). By contrast, plasmatocytes gav"

Chem. 1989; 269: 371-380Google Scholar). The circulating form of the coenzyme in blood is the monoglutamate derivative (n = 1), which is readily transported into cells. Once in the cell, additional glutamate residues are added to form H4PteGlu3–7 in a reaction catalyzed by folylpolyglutamate synthetase utilizing both ATP and glutamate as substrates (3Sanghani P.C. Moran R.G. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 18: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Only polyglutamate forms are physiologically active in the cell, although all but one enzyme involved in one-carbon metabolism utilize the monoglutamate derivativein vitro. Polyglutamylation blocks cellular export by multidrug resistance proteins of H4PteGlun and chemotherapeutic anti-folate analogs such as methotrexate and also increases H4PteGlun affinity for most enzymes in one-carbon metabolism (4Zeng H. Chen Z.S. Belinsky M.G. Rea P.A. Kruh G.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7225-7232PubMed Google Scholar). The polyglutamate chain may also act as a tether in “channeling” the H4PteGlun coenzyme between enzymes involved in one-carbon metabolism (5Ovadi J. Srere P.A. Int. Rev.

Most of these structures have been determined without any bound folate or folate analog or with folate analogs lacking a polyglutamate chain or having only a single glutamyl residue. This deficiency is due to several technical constraints and may also be inherent in the nature of polyglutamylated H4PteGlun binding. Even in cases where polyglutamylated folates might be used, the enzymes are often crystallized in high salt, and the anions of these salts compete for binding with the anionic polyglutamate part of the coenzyme, which may cause weak or disordered binding of the polyglutamate chain. It is also possible that the polyglutamate chain occurs as multiple conformers whose occupancies are too low to be interpreted from an electron density map. The only two published crystallographic structures with a bound polyglutamyl chain are those for tetraglutamylfolate analogs bound to thymidylate synthase (16Kamb A. Finer-Moore J. Calvert A.H. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9883-9890Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17Finer-Moore J.S. Maley G.F. Maley F. Montfort W.R. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15459-15468Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the first of these structures (folate analog CB3717-Glu4), there was unambiguous electron density for triglutamate in one active site and diglutamate in the other, but the group temperature factors for Glu2 and Glu3 in the first site were high. The failure to see the complete ligand in this structure may have been a consequence of the high ionic strength (I ≥ 3.5m) of the crystallization medium (2.5 mammonium sulfate), which limited occupancy of the binding site. This inference is supported by the second thymidylate synthase-folate analog crystal structure (folate analog LY231514-Glu4), in which Glu1–Glu3 are defined, but the electron density for Glu4 is poorer. Crystals of this complex were obtained at lower ionic strength (I ≥ 2.0m). SHMT catalyzes the conversion of serine and H4PteGlun to glycine and 5,10-methylene-H4PteGlun, which is the major entry point of one-carbon groups into one-carbon metabolism (1Schirch V. Blakely R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins: Chemistry and Biochemistry of Folates. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1984: 399-432Google Scholar). An increase in glutamate chain length from 1 to 6 increases the affinity of H4PteGlun for several mammalian SHMTs by ∼2 orders of magnitude, but results in only a 2-fold increase in affinity for Escherichia coli SHMT (22Matthews R.G.

The human and rabbit SHMT structures have no bound folate ligand, whereas the E. coliand mouse SHMT structures are ternary complexes of the monoglutamate of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu with glycine substrate. Crystal structures for bsSHMT include the enzyme with no bound ligands, with either serine or glycine bound, and the ternary complex of glycine and 5-CHO-H4PteGlu. However, none of these structures defines the polyglutamate-binding site. In addition to the conversion of serine to glycine and the concomitant transfer of the one-carbon group to H4PteGlun, SHMT also catalyzes the physiologically important conversion of 5,10-methenyl-H4PteGlun to 5-CHO-H4PteGlun (29Stover P. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14227-14233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol.

The polyglutamate forms of the product 5-CHO-H4PteGlu are slow tightly binding inhibitors of the physiological reaction catalyzed by SHMT, but the monoglutamate derivative binds rapidly (23Stover P. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1543-1550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polyglutamate forms of H4PteGlu and 5-methyl-H4PteGlu have affinity for the active site of rcSHMT comparable to 5-CHO-H4PteGlun, but are not slow binding. Of all the reduced folate derivatives, only 5-CHO-H4PteGlun is stable to degradative oxidation, and this has permitted extensive spectroscopic binding and isothermal titration calorimetry studies of this compound with rcSHMT (23Stover P. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1543-1550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,32Huang T. Wang C. Maras B. Barra D. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13536-13542Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the work described here, we have measured solution equilibrium binding and kinetic constants for wild-type and structure-based site mutant tetrameric rcSHMTs with 5-CHO-H4PteGlun and H4PteGlun to define the binding site of the polyglutamate tail. We have also determined the crystal structure at 2.7-Å resolution of a complex of rcSHMT with active site-bound 5-CHO-H4PteGlu3 obtained by soaking unliganded crystals of rcSHMT in 5-CHO-H4PteGlu3. This is the first crystal structure of a natural polyglutamylated folate bound to an enzyme and is formed under conditions of low ionic strength. It provides new information on the nature of the interaction of this cofactor with proteins and, together with the solution data, provides a consistent picture for the location and properties of the H4PteGlun-binding site of SHMT. H4PteGlu1–5 were purchased from Schircks Laboratory (Jona, Switzerland). These compounds were reduced and converted to (6S)-H4PteGlun as previously described (33Stover P. Schirch V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). (6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlun was also made by this method. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a PCR-based method as previously described (34Iurescia S. Condò I. Angelaccio S. Delle Fratte S. Bossa F. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Mutant enzymes were expressed from a recA − strain of E. coli and purified as described for wild-type rcSHMT (35di Salvo M.L. Delle Fratte S., De Biase D. Bossa F. Schirch V. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).K m and k cat values withl-serine as substrate were determined at pH 7.3 and 30 °C by coupling to the NADP-dependent oxidation of the product 5,10-methylene-H4PteGlu (36Schirch V. Shostak K. Zamora M. Gautam-Basak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 759-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). K dvalues for (6S)-H4PteGlu1–5 were determined by a spectrophotometric method and analyzed by the method of Scatchard as described (32Huang T. Wang C. Maras B. Barra D. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13536-13542Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Tm values were determined in a Microcal differential scanning calorimeter. Crystals of rcSHMT were grown in 0.5-ml Eppendorf tubes at room temperature from 10-μl drops of rcSHMT at ∼50 mg/ml in 3% polyethylene glycol 4000 and 50 mm potassium MES (pH 7.0), sometimes with seeding (37Kazanina G. Radaev S. Wright H.T. Schirch V. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 123: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Fresh crystals were stabilized in 4.8% polyethylene glycol 4000 in the same buffer for 1 h and then soaked overnight in the same solution with 0.4 mm(6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu3. Crystals were transiently (<30 s) placed in a cryoprotectant of 30% polyethylene glycol 400 and 6% polyethylene glycol 4000 in 50 mmpotassium MES (pH 7.0) and flash-frozen in liquid N2 for data collection. Data for a 100° sector were collected on an RAxisII with Osmics confocal optics at 60 kV and 150 mA. Oscillation frames were integrated with Denzo and merged with Scalepack (38Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Merged intensity data were converted to structure factor amplitudes using Truncate (39Collaborative Computing Project No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Data collection statistics are summarized in TableI. Although the unliganded rcSHMT structure was previously assigned to space group P41212 with one dimer/asymmetric unit, in this work, we indexed these crystals in the lower symmetry P41 space group with one tetramer/asymmetric unit.Table IData collection and refinement statistics for the rcSHMT·5-CHO-H4PteGlu3 complexData collection Resolution (Å)2.7 R merge 1-aRmerge = ΣΣi‖I h −I hi‖/ΣΣi I h, whereI h is the mean intensity of reflection h.

Open table in a new tab Initial phases were based on a 2.1-Å structure of unliganded rcSHMT, 2J. N. Scarsdale, G. Kazanina, V. Schirch, and H. T. Wright, unpublished data. which was nearly isomorphous with the rcSHMT·5-CHO-H4PteGlu3structure. Initially, the space group was assigned as P41212 with one dimer/asymmetric unit. After 20 cycles of rigid body refinement in CNS Version 1.0 (40Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar),R work and R free were 35.8 and 35.6%, respectively. The resulting phases were used to calculate a SIGMAA-weighted 2mF o − dF c map that was visualized using the program O (41Jones T.A. Kjeldgard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In this initial map, broken density corresponding to 5-CHO-H4PteGlu was observed in monomer B of the dimer in the asymmetric unit, but density was not observed for either of the two remaining glutamyl groups. The model was iteratively refined via high temperature torsion angle dynamics and a maximum likelihood target function (42Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1996; 52: 659-668Crossref Scopus (319) Google Scholar) using CNS Version 1.0, with each refinement cycle followed by manual rebuilding in program O using SIGMAA-weighted 2mF o − dF c cross-validated maps or composite omit maps (43Bhat T.N. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 279-281Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Non-crystallographic symmetry was enforced via positional NCS restraints between monomers comprising the dimer. During iterative rebuilding, residue geometries and interactions were monitored with the programs OOPS (44Kleywegt G. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), WHATCHECK (45Hooft R.W.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar), and PROBE (46Word J.M. Lovell S.C. LaBean T.H. Taylor H.C. Zalis M.E. Presley B.K. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1711-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). We noted that for the 2.1-Å unliganded rcSHMT structure, for which diffraction data had been acquired under similar conditions, the value of R work plateaued near 24% in P41212, even though visual inspection of both SIGMAA-weighted and composite omit maps did not indicate significant errors in the model. By re-merging the integrated intensity data in the lower P41 symmetry space group and expanding the asymmetric unit to a pair of dimers with 222 symmetry, bothR work and R free dropped significantly, which led us to conclude that the correct space group is P41. In the lower symmetry space group, additional NCS restraints were added between monomers in the two tight dimers comprising the asymmetric unit. After several rounds of rebuilding and refinement, during which the weight of the NCS restraints was reduced from 300 to 37.5 kcal/mol and 390 water molecules and 3 glycerol molecules were added to the model,R free andR work improved to 29.4 and 22.0%, respectively. In the latter stages of the refinement, positional restraints were removed for regions of the structure that differed significantly between NCS-related monomers, and model adjustments were made in SIGMAA-weighted 3mF o − 2dF cmaps. In the final cycles of simulated annealing via high temperature torsion angle dynamics, the positions of the 5-CHO-H4PteGlu3 residues and several amino acids in partially disordered loops that interact with 5-CHO-H4PteGlu3 were restrained via harmonic restraints. Coordinate errors in the refined structure were estimated using the formalism of Luzatti (47Luzatti P.V. Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar) as implemented in CNS. Refinement statistics are summarized in TableI. Of the 470 residues in the rcSHMT sequence, there is no interpretable electron density for the amino-terminal 13 residues. Also, as noted below, there is variable missing density in the different subunits for residues in the insert just after residue 244 and broken or localized missing density around residues 134, 355, and 399. Electrostatic field calculations were carried out by numerical solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation using the program DELPHI as implemented in the INSIGHT 2000 package (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). In this calculation, the protein formal charge set, which corresponds to unit charges on Lys, Arg, Glu, and Asp residues, was used. For the triglutamate chain of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu3, unit negative charges were assigned to the α-carboxyl groups of the glutamate residues and to the side chain carboxyl group for the terminal glutamate residue. In the rcSHMT structure, residues for which density was not observed, as well as side chains of residues modeled as alanine due to missing side chain density, were added to the structure with the aid of a side chain rotamer data base (49Ponder J.W. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar) in O Version 8.0. The calculation was carried out on a cubic grid with 165 points along each axis, corresponding to a grid spacing of 3 Å. To investigate the effect of binding of the triglutamate chain on the surface charge distribution in rcSHMT, the bound folate residues were excluded from one set of calculations. The surface of rcSHMT has a net positive charge at neutral pH (25Scarsdale J.N. Kazanina G. Radaev S. Schirch V. Wright H.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8347-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and we previously described a possible cationic binding locus for the extended polyglutamate tail of H4PteGlun emanating from the folate-binding site of each of the subunits (27Scarsdale J.N. Radaev S. Kazanina G. Schirch V. Wright H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Both Lys → Gln or Glu and Arg → Gln or Glu point mutants in and near this channel were made, and the mutant proteins were purified and assayed with serine and H4PteGlu to determine specific activity, stoichiometry of H4PteGlu binding, and affinity with serine for both H4PteGlu and H4PteGlu5. All mutants exhibitedK m values for serine that were the same as those of the wild-type enzyme and a stoichiometry for H4PteGlu5 of 0.5/subunit. Many of the mutant enzymes also showed no significant changes in eitherk cat or K d for H4PteGlu and H4PteGlu5 (TableII). However, some mutations did affect the affinity for H4PteGlun, with the relative affinity being dependent on the number of glutamate residues in the folate (Table II). The catalytic activity for these mutants with serine and H4PteGlu as substrates was also essentially unchanged (<2-fold) when extrapolated to infinite H4PteGlu concentration.Table IIAffinity of H4PteGlun for rcSHMT site mutants as a function of glutamate chain lengthrcSHMTK dH4PteGluH4PteGlu2H4PteGlu3H4PteGlu5μmWild-type10 (1.0)2-aRatios of theK d values of the mutant enzymes compared with the wild-type enzyme are shown in light-face.6.0 (1.0)0.7 (1.0)0.4 (1.0)K1341Q26 (2.6)2-bRatios of K dvalues that exceed a factor of 2 are shown in boldface.8.0 (1.3)10 (14)0.8 (2.0)K1342Q100 (10)12 (2.0)7.0 (10)0.9 (2.0)K346Q50 (5.0)10 (1.7)3.0 (4.3)4.0 (10)K354Q21 (2.0)4.0 (0.7)0.8 (1.0)0.3 (0.8)K3991E11 (1.1)7.0 (1.2)6.0 (8.5)12 (30)K3991Q13 (1.3)5.0 (0.8)2.0 (3.0)5.4 (13)No changes in k cat and K m for serine or H4PteGlun were observed for the following mutants: K335Q, R3963Q, K3994E, K3994Q, K401E, K401Q, K405E, K405Q, H406D, H406N, R407E, R407Q, R412E, R412O, and Loop deletion (residues 244–249 deleted).2-a Ratios of theK d values of the mutant enzymes compared with the wild-type enzyme are shown in light-face.2-b Ratios of K dvalues that exceed a factor of 2 are shown in boldface.

None of the mutations significantly affected the binding of H4PteGlu2, but mutation of Lys3991and Lys346 decreased the binding of H4PteGlu3 and H4PteGlu5. Removal of the insertion loop at residue 244, which includes an Arg and a Lys residue, lowered the affinity for the pentaglutamate by 2-fold and had no effect on the shorter glutamate chain lengths. The crystal structure of the soaked 5-CHO-H4PteGlu3 complex (see below) shows that the polyglutamate moiety of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu3 follows the channel hypothesized from the earlier rcSHMT model to be the polyglutamate-binding site, on which the design of the site mutants was based. Previous studies have shown that saturation of rcSHMT with serine greatly increases the thermal stability of the enzyme (36Schirch V. Shostak K. Zamora M. Gautam-Basak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 759-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tm values increase from 65 °C in the absence of serine to ∼78 °C in the presence of serine. Glycine also increases the thermal stability to a similar extent, but only in the presence of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu. This increased stability, as well as other changes in physical properties, was interpreted to be the result of a closure of the active site upon binding substrates and was inferred to require a group occupying the substrate serine side chain site (36Schirch V. Shostak K. Zamora M. Gautam-Basak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 759-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We measured the thermal stability of those mutant enzymes that showed altered folate affinity to determine whether any of the residues mutated might be a trigger for the closure of the active site (Table II). Such mutants might not show the stabilizing effect of serine and glycine in the presence of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu. However, the mutations that resulted in the greatest decrease in affinity for H4PteGlun(K1341Q, K1342Q, K346Q, and K3991Q/E) did not significantly alter the thermal properties of rcSHMT. The K1342Q mutation did lower the"
https://openalex.org/W2090002737,"High expression of transferrin receptor (TfR) on the membrane of erythroid cells accounts for the high level of iron required to sustain heme synthesis. Several studies indicate that during erythroid differentiation TfR expression is highly dependent on transcriptional regulation. In this study we characterized the minimal region able to confer transcriptional regulation during erythroid differentiation in Friend leukemia cells (FLC). This region of 120 bp, upstream the transcription start site, contains an overlapping consensus recognition sequence for AP1/CREB/ATF transcription factors and for proteins of the Ets family and a GC rich region. Here, we report that both the Ets and the Ap1/CRE like sites are essential for promoter activity during erythroid differentiation. We showed that Ets-1 binds to the EBS-TfR and its binding activity decreases in FLC induced to differentiate and during normal erythroid differentiation. Consistent with this, FLC constitutively expressing Ets-1 show a decrease in TfR gene expression, globin mRNA and hemoglobin synthesis. We conclude that Ets-1 binding activity is modulated during erythroid maturation and that a deregulated expression of this transcription factor interferes with terminal erythroid differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2142913324,"The small cytokine-inducible SH2 domain-containing protein (CIS) has been implicated in the negative regulation of signaling through cytokine receptors. CIS reduces growth of erythropoietin receptor (EpoR)-dependent cell lines, but its role in proliferation, differentiation, and survival of erythroid progenitor cells has not been resolved. To dissect the function of CIS in cell lines and erythroid progenitor cells, we generated green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged versions of wild type CIS, a mutant harboring an inactivated SH2 domain (CIS R107K), and a mutant with a deletion of the SOCS Box (CISDeltaBox). Retroviral expression of the GFP fusion proteins in BaF3-EpoR cells revealed that both Tyr-401 in the EpoR and an intact SH2 domain within CIS are prerequisites for receptor recruitment. As a consequence, both are essential for the growth inhibitory effect of CIS, whereas the CIS SOCS box is dispensable. Accordingly, the retroviral expression of GFP-CIS but not GFP-CIS R107K impaired proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells in colony assays. Erythroid differentiation was unaffected by either protein. Interestingly, apoptosis of erythroid progenitor cells was increased upon GFP-CIS expression and this required the presence both of an intact SH2 domain and the SOCS box. Thus, CIS negatively regulates signaling at two levels, apoptosis and proliferation, and thereby sets a threshold for signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2054413157,"The latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes cellular transformation and activation of several intracellular signaling events. In this report, we show that BLMP1 (encoded by the LMP1 gene derived from the B95-8 strain of EBV) triggers the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in Balb/3T3 fibroblasts. Intriguingly, NLMP1, a natural sequence variant of LMP1 identified in EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma biopsy, does not similarly induce iNOS expression. BLMP1-induced iNOS in Balb/3T3 cells is active to produce nitric oxide (NO), and NO production can be blocked by several iNOS inhibitors. When subjected to environmental stress, Balb/3T3 cells that produce NO lose viability more rapidly than non NO-producing cells. Blockage of NO generation by iNOS inhibitors enhances the viability of NO-producing cells under stress conditions. The activities of caspase-3 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, two important regulators mediating stress-induced apoptosis, are significantly potentiated following heat shock treatment of BLMP1-expressing/NO-producing cells, compared to parental and NLMP1-expressing cells. Furthermore, treatment with iNOS inhibitor augmented the cloning efficiency (in culture) and tumor growth (in nude mice) of BLMP1-expressing/NO-producing cells. Collectively, the results demonstrate that BLMP1 induces iNOS expression and NO production in Balb/3T3 cells, which leads to the alteration of cell functions, including sensitivity to environmental stress, capability to colonize independent of anchorage and tumorigenicity in nude mice. Our data additionally implicate that the differential iNOS induction potential of the two LMP1 forms may represent the basis of a functional difference between the two LMP1 proteins."

We have previously shown that transformation-defective Ad5 E1A-derivatives are excellent tumor suppressors. For tumor-specific expression of the E1A-derivatives we intend to use tumor specific human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) core promoters. Here, we show that Spm2 and other E1A proteins with an intact amino terminus activated all hTERT constructs 10-20-fold in malignant tumor cells but not in primary fibroblasts, without affecting the activity of endogenous telomerase. The transcription rate in tumor cells was in the range of transcription from the SV40 promoter, which qualifies an E1A-hTERT system as a putative tumor targeting/expression system. The activation of the hTERT promoter by E1A was enhanced upon deletion of the Wilms' tumor 1 negative regulatory element and maintained high after deletion of the adjacent c-Myc-responsive E-box, demonstrating an important role of the remaining sequences that contain several Sp1-motifs. E1A-mediated hTERT activation was independent from the presence of the conserved region 3 (CR3) of E1A but dependent on E1A's binding to p300/CBP and recruitment of its histone acetyltransferase activity. Moreover, E1A-Spm2 and histone deacetylase-1 behaved as antagonists with respect to the regulation of transcription from the hTERT promoter. Overall, hTERT promoter/E1A-Spm2 systems may turn out to be excellent tools for transcriptionally targeted anticancer gene therapy."

This procedure yields highly pure HPRG suitable for investigation by x-ray absorption spectroscopy of the zinc-binding behavior of the protein. X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis of a 2:1 zinc-HPRG complex shows that zinc is bound to the protein, most probably in a dinuclear cluster where each Zn2+ ion is coordinated, on average, by three histidine ligands and one heavier ligand, likely a sulfur from a cysteine. 11 cysteines of HPRG from different species are totally conserved, suggesting that five disulfide bridges are essential for the proper folding of the protein. At least another cysteine is present at different positions in the histidine-proline-rich domain of HPRG in all species, suggesting that this cysteine is the candidate for zinc ligation in the muscle variant of HPRG. The same conclusion is likely to be true for the six histidines used by the protein as zinc ligands. The presence in muscle HPRG of a specific zinc-binding site permits us to envisage the addition of HPRG into the family of metallochaperones.

Although the physiological role of this protein remains unclear, it has been implicated in a number of processes, including blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, immune response, and transport of metal ions (1Peterson C.B. Morgan W.T. Blackburn M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7567-7574Google Scholar). The cellular origin of the mouse protein has recently been defined by Northern blot analysis showing that the HPRG mRNA is localized specifically to the liver, suggesting that the previously described HPRG expression by immune cells is due to the acquisition of the plasma protein derived from the liver (2Hulett M.D. Parish C.R. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 280-287Google Scholar). In a previous paper we reported that denaturation of rabbit skeletal muscle AMP deaminase (AMP aminohydrolase, EC 3.5.4.6) in acidic medium allows the chromatographic separation from the enzyme of a peptide with an amino acid composition significantly different from that derived from the available AMP deaminase cDNAs. N-terminal sequence analysis of the fragments liberated by limited proteolysis revealed a striking similarity of the novel protein to rabbit plasma HPRG although, in comparison with mature HPRG, the AMP deaminase-associated variant probably contains a unique N-terminal extension (3Ranieri-Raggi M. Montali U. Ronca F. Sabbatini A. Brown P.E. Moir A.J.G. Raggi A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 641-648Google Scholar). We now report that the AMP deaminase-associated variant of HPRG can be isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle by a modification of the protocol used in our laboratory for the purification of AMP deaminase. The modification allows the partial dissociation of HPRG at a high degree of purity from the cellulose phosphate-bound enzyme. Rabbit plasma HPRG contains 53 histidine residues, of which 34 are located in the histidine-proline-rich domain containing 15 repeats of the sequence (H/P)(H/P)PHG that has been proposed to mediate interactions with transition metals, although no evidence of a specific binding has been given (4Borza D.B. Tatum F.M. Morgan W.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1925-1934Google Scholar). The HPRG component of rabbit skeletal muscle AMP deaminase contains 10 mol of histidine residues/10,000 g of protein (3Ranieri-Raggi M. Montali U. Ronca F. Sabbatini A. Brown P.E. Moir A.J.G. Raggi A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 641-648Google Scholar). The abundance of such potential metal ligands suggests that HPRG has the ability and perhaps the function to bind several metal ions, and it has been established (5Morgan W.T. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1054-1061Google Scholar, 6Guthans S.L. Morgan W.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 218: 320-328Google Scholar) that HPRG from rabbit serum binds Hg2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Cd2+, and Co2+ in descending order of binding affinity. However, no attempts to characterize the structure of the metal-binding site(s) of HPRG have been performed. This prompted us to an investigation by x-ray absorption spectroscopy of the zinc-binding sites of the HPRG variant that we have isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle as a first step toward determining the physicochemical properties of this novel protein. Chelating Fast Flow Sepharose was from AmershamBiosciences. Phosphocellulose resin (P-11) was supplied by Whatman International Ltd., Maidstone, UK). All of the chemicals and other reagents used were of analytical grade. AMP deaminase was prepared as described previously (7Ranieri-Raggi M. Raggi A. FEBS Lett. 1979; 102: 59-63Google Scholar) from fresh muscle dissected from the back and hind leg of rabbits. Because rabbit skeletal muscle AMP deaminase undergoes progressive fragmentation with storage, homogenization of the muscle and phosphocellulose purification of the enzyme was carried out at each step using a buffer system containing 5 mm NaN3 to reduce the rate of proteolytic processes. In the presence of azide, the 85–70-kDa band transition of the purified enzyme occurred with a half-time of one month, significantly slower than that previously described (half-time of 2 weeks) (8Ranieri-Raggi M. Raggi A. Biochem. J. 1980; 189: 367-368Google Scholar). Following the identification (described in the present paper) of the peptide that elutes at 0.6 m KCl from cellulose phosphate-bound AMP deaminase with the HPRG component of the enzyme, the fractions that formed the peak eluted with 5 mmNaN3, 0.6 M KCl, pH 7.0, were concentrated by ultrafiltration with an Amicon Microcon YM-30 centrifugal filter device (Millipore) and stored in aliquots at −20 °C. An 1 mmHPRG sample was prepared for XAS by further concentration of the pooled fractions. The protein concentrations of the various enzyme fractions were determined spectrophotometrically by usingA 2801%,1 cm values of 9.1 and 8.2, respectively, for AMP deaminase and its isolated HPRG component, which were calculated on the basis of protein determinations by the method described in Ref. 9Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar using bovine serum albumin as standard. The isolated rabbit skeletal muscle variant of HPRG was assumed to have the same molecular mass of 58 kDa calculated for the rabbit plasma protein (4Borza D.B. Tatum F.M. Morgan W.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1925-1934Google Scholar). The AMP deaminase activity was determined spectrophotometrically as previously described using a Shimadzu UV-260 spectrophotometer (10Martini D. Ranieri-Raggi M. Sabbatini A.R.M. Raggi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1544: 123-132Google Scholar). Electrophoresis in the presence of 0.1% (w/v) SDS was carried out under reducing conditions on 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide slab gels in 0.1 m Tris, 0.1 mBicine, pH 8.3. Protein standards (Sigma) were used to determine molecular weights. Electroblotting was performed by the method of LeGendre and Matsudaira (11LeGendre N. Matsudaira P. Matsudaira P. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, New York1989: 49-69Google Scholar) using 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, containing 10% (v/v) methanol. Transfers were performed for 60–90 min at 400 mA. N-terminal sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems model 476A protein sequencer. The interaction of rabbit muscle HPRG with metals was assessed by changes in absorption. Absorption spectra were recorded by using a Shimadzu UV-260 spectrophotometer at room temperature. Spectral measurements were made within 1 min of mixing protein with metal, and no absorbance changes after this time were noted. Equal concentrations of metal in the reference cuvette served as reference solutions. The fractional saturation of HPRG, α, is defined as the ratio of the observed increase in absorbance (A) at 275 nm to the maximum ΔA at saturation of the protein. Two equivalents of Zn2+from a ZnSO4 solution in ultrapure water were added to 1.0 mm rabbit muscle HPRG solution (prepared as described above) to obtain 50 μl of Zn-HPRG 2:1 complex. 45 μl of the above solution were filled into a plastic cell covered with Kapton windows. Both the cells and the Kapton foils used for the windows were thoroughly washed with ultrapure water and absolute ethanol and then dried before use. The sample cell was mounted in a two-stage Displex cryostat (modified Oxford instruments) and kept at 20 K during the data collection. The XAS data were collected at Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY) (Hamburg, Germany) at the EMBL bending magnet beam line D2 using Si (111) double monochromator for the measurement at the zinc edge. During the measurements the DESY storage ring was operating under normal conditions (4.5 GeV, 90–140 mA). Ionization chambers in front and behind the sample were used to monitor the beam intensity. The XAS data have been recorded by measuring the zinc-Kα fluorescence using a Canberra 13-element solid state detector over the energy range between 9324 and 10624 eV using variable energy step widths. In the x-ray absorption near-edge structure and the extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) regions, steps of 0.3 and 0.5–1.2 eV were used, respectively. An absolute energy calibration of the spectra was obtained by recording known Bragg reflections of a Si (220) crystal in back reflection geometry following a reported procedure (12Pettifer R.F. Hermes C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1985; 18: 404-412Google Scholar) (E 0,Zn = 9663.5 eV). 25 scans for a total of more than 1.5 million counts/experimental point were averaged to obtain good signal/noise statistics. The pre-edge background removal has been performed by a linear fit, whereas the removal of the atomic background above the edge and the EXAFS extraction has been performed by fitting a cubic spline using the EXPROG program package (13Nolting H.F. Hermes C. EXPROG: EMBL EXAFS data analysis and evaluation program package for PC/AT. European Molecular Biology Laboratory, DESY, Hamburg, Germany1993Google Scholar). The full k 3 weighted EXAFS spectrum (23–750 eV above E 0) and its Fourier transform (FT) calculated over the range 3.0–14.0 Å−1 have been compared with theoretical simulations obtained by the set of programs EXCURVE9.20 (14Binsted N. Hasnain S.S. J. Synchrotron Rad. 1996; 3: 185-196Google Scholar). The edge energy E 0 was adjusted at the beginning of the refinement to bring the experiments and the simulations on the same scale and left unchanged during the fitting. A fixed amplitude factor of 0.95 was used to compensate for amplitude reduction of the signal caused by multiple excitations. Thek3 weighted full spectrum was simulated by varying the atom types and the coordination numbers (as integers) and iteratively refining the distance (r) and the Debye-Waller factor (2ς2) for each atomic shell. Multiple scattering contributions were included for histidine imidazole ligands. A zinc-bound imidazole ring was generated by molecular modeling with a zinc-N(His) distance obtained from the EXAFS first shell analysis. The coordinates from the model were input to EXCURVE9.20 to provide a single unit with the correct geometry. A single distance fit was able to reproduce the closer atomic shell, allowing us to minimize the number of parameters in the refinement procedure by simulating the zinc histidine ligands by a single zinc-bound imidazole ring with a fixed coordination number. In this way the imidazole outer shell distances were defined by the zinc-N(His) distance, and the imidazole outer atoms were constrained to vary within 0.1 Å from the idealized positions. All of the histidine numbers between 1 and 4 were tried with 3, giving the correct fit. The imidazole ring plane was kept coincident with the zinc-nitrogen bond throughout the refinement. The quality of the fit obtained was assessed by the following goodness-of-fit function,ε2=1/(Nind−p)(Nind/N)∑iNwi(χiexp(k)−χith(k))2Equation 1 where N ind is the number of independent data points (N ind = (2ΔkΔr)/π),p is the number of parameters, N is the number of data points, and w is the weight of the spectrum. The quality of the fit obtained was also assessed by the R-factor as defined within EXCURVE9.20 as follows.Re xafs=∑iN1/ς(‖χiexp(k)−χith(k)‖)·100Equation 2 A rapid method for the preparation of AMP deaminase from frozen rabbit skeletal muscle was introduced on the basis of the observation that the enzyme remained bound to cellulose phosphate under conditions (0.45 m KCl, pH 7.0) at which apparently no other proteins are bound (15Smiley K.L. Berry A.J. Suelter C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2502-2506Google Scholar). Thus, elution with 1.0 m KCl, pH 7.0, yielded a homogeneous preparation of the enzyme at a high degree of purity. However, by eluting cellulose phosphate column with a linear gradient from 0.45 to 1.0 m KCl, sometimes a small protein peak that was not examined was found by the same authors to precede the main activity peak (16Zielke C.L. Suelter C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1313-1317Google Scholar). The constant presence of presumably the same additional peptide was observed in the enzyme prepared in our laboratory from fresh rabbit muscle. Therefore, we introduced a modification in the cellulose phosphate chromatography (i.e. the enzyme was eluted with 1.0 m KCl after the column had been washed with 0.6 m KCl) that effectively separated the contaminant peptide from the purified enzyme (7Ranieri-Raggi M. Raggi A. FEBS Lett. 1979; 102: 59-63Google Scholar). We have now found that the HPRG component of rabbit skeletal muscle AMP deaminase is dissociated from the cellulose phosphate-bound enzyme at a high degree of purity by elution with 0.6 m KCl, indicating its correspondence to the peptide previously discarded as a contaminant of the enzyme preparation. Fig. 1 shows the elution profile of cellulose phosphate-bound AMP deaminase obtained by two successive washing steps with 0.6 and 1.0 m KCl, after having washed the column with 0.45 m KCl. In five separate enzyme preparations the yield of the protein eluted with 0.6 m KCl (peak 1) and with 1.0 m KCl (peak 2) was 13 ± 4 and 73 ± 11 mg/kg of rabbit skeletal muscle, respectively. The protein in peak 1 was not completely devoid of AMP deaminase activity, but its specific activity (0.5 units/mg of protein) (1 unit = 1 μmol of AMP deaminated per min when assayed in 50 mm imidazole HCl, pH 6.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm AMP at 20 °C) was negligible in comparison with that of the protein in peak 2 (210 units/mg of protein). Analysis by SDS/PAGE of the two freshly pooled peaks (Fig. 2, A andB, lane 1) showed that both gave rise to a main band of approximately 85 kDa, but an additional faint 95-kDa band that was almost completely proteolyzed in the first week of storage at 4 °C was present in the electrophoretogram of pool 2 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 2).Figure 2Alteration of the SDS/PAGE behavior with time of storage at 4 °C of whole rabbit skeletal muscle AMP deaminase and its HPRG component separated by ion exchange chromatography. A, 3-μg samples of pool 1 (Fig. 1) stored at 4 °C in 5 mm NaN3, 0.6 M KCl, pH 7.0. B, 4-μg samples of pool 2 (Fig. 1) stored at 4 °C in 5 mmNaN3, 1.0 M KCl, pH 7.0.

Samples of freshly prepared proteins (lanes 1), proteins stored for 5 days (lanes 2), 12 days (lanes 3), 21 days (lanes 4), or 27 days (lanes 5), or freshly prepared protein incubated with 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol for 1 h at room temperature (A, lane 6) were denatured with 0.1% SDS and run on 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide slab gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) With aging of pool 2, a 85–70-kDa band transition also occurred with a half-time of 1 month (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2–5), confirming our previous demonstration that limited proteolysis of rabbit skeletal muscle AMP deaminase, removing the 95-residue-long N terminus of the enzyme, converts the native 85-kDa subunit to an approximately 70-kDa core that is resistant to further proteolysis (17Ronca F. Ranieri-Raggi M. Brown P.E. Moir A.J.G. Raggi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 123-129Google Scholar). In contrast, the 85-kDa band of pool 1 was almost completely transformed in the first week of storage, giving rise to a 95-kDa band that was resistant to proteolysis, even if the enzyme was stored at 4 °C for several months (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2–5). By electroblotting and sequencing analysis, the 85-kDa original band of each pool yielded no N-terminal sequences, confirming the previous suggestion that the N terminus of rabbit skeletal muscle AMP deaminase is modified (3Ranieri-Raggi M. Montali U. Ronca F. Sabbatini A. Brown P.E. Moir A.J.G. Raggi A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 641-648Google Scholar). In contrast, the 95-kDa bands revealed the single sequence LTPTDXKTTKPL corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of rabbit plasma HPRG. The yield of the sequence increased after storage for few days at 4 °C, indicating that the native protein has a blocked N terminus and that it undergoes a proteolytic process starting with its isolation. It should be noted that rabbit plasma HPRG migrates in SDS/PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 90 or 94 kDa (4Borza D.B. Tatum F.M. Morgan W.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1925-1934Google Scholar, 18Morgan W.T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1496-1501Google Scholar, 19Mori S. Nishibori M. Yamaoka K. Okamoto M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 191-196Google Scholar) higher than that deduced from its sequence (58 kDa) or that calculated taking account of its 17.5% carbohydrate content (70 kDa) (4Borza D.B. Tatum F.M. Morgan W.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1925-1934Google Scholar). Interestingly, a 1-h incubation of a sample of freshly prepared pool 1 with 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol at room temperature before analysis by SDS/PAGE caused the same 85–95 kDa transition that was observed on storage (Fig. 2 A, lane 6). It seems likely, on the basis of this observation, that the shift in the migration on SDS/PAGE is due to a change in conformation consequent to the reduction of a disulfide bond present in freshly isolated HPRG. The presence in the HPRG component of AMP deaminase of a disulfide bridge homologous to that supposed to connect Cys-6 and Cys-497 in rabbit plasma HPRG (4Borza D.B. Tatum F.M. Morgan W.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1925-1934Google Scholar) was inferred on the basis of electroblotting and sequencing analysis of the SDS/PAGE bands corresponding to presumably disulfide-linked fragments liberated by trypsin cleavage (3Ranieri-Raggi M. Montali U. Ronca F. Sabbatini A. Brown P.E. Moir A.J.G. Raggi A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 641-648Google Scholar). It was also observed that the reduction of that disulfide bridge in rabbit plasma HPRG required prior denaturation of the protein and that even after reduction, the separation of the N- and C-terminal domains of the protein by ion exchange chromatography was difficult, because of the hydrophobicity of the contact area (4Borza D.B. Tatum F.M. Morgan W.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1925-1934Google Scholar). To ascertain whether the catalytic subunit of AMP deaminase was present only in traces in peak 1 in Fig. 1, as indicated by the determination of the enzyme activity, we applied a sample of pool 1, denatured by overnight dialysis against 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol and 3 m urea, to a metal affinity column (Chelating Fast Flow Sepharose; Amersham Biosciences) charged with Zn2+ and equilibrated with the dialysis buffer (results not shown). We have previously used zinc affinity chromatography to separate the 95-kDa HPRG component from the 85- and 70-kDa components present in whole AMP deaminase because the 85- and 70-kDa species are not retained by this resin and eluted in the void volume (20Ranieri-Raggi M. Martini D. Sabbatini A.R.M. Moir A.J.G. Raggi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1645: 81-88Google Scholar). In contrast, all of the protein present in the urea-denatured sample of pool 1 was retained by the resin and was eluted only when the resin was washed with the EDTA containing buffer, which strips the metal ions from the gel. Analysis by SDS/PAGE of the eluted fractions revealed identity of migration with the 95-kDa peptide used as starting material. Electroblotting and sequencing of the EDTA-eluted peptide revealed the sequence LTPTDXKTTKPLAEKALDLI, corresponding to the rabbit plasma HPRG N-terminal sequence (4Borza D.B. Tatum F.M. Morgan W.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1925-1934Google Scholar). The presence of HPRG as an apparently single component in peak 1 (Fig. 1) indicates that 0.6 m KCl selectively elutes the HPRG component from the AMP deaminase complex adsorbed to cellulose phosphate. However, a significant amount of HPRG is still present as the 85-kDa component in the 1 m KCl-eluted enzyme because the same N-terminal sequence (LTPTDXK) shown by the 95-kDa band was obtained by electroblotting and sequencing of the 70-kDa band; furthermore its yield increased with time of storage of the enzyme at 4 °C. A plausible interpretation of this data is that the 70-kDa band contains a C-terminally truncated version of HPRG. This is in agreement with the analysis of the peptides liberated by limited proteolysis of plasma HPRG and of the HPRG component of AMP deaminase showing that both proteins behave as approximately 70-kDa fragments when they are split inside the disulfide bridge connecting the N-terminal domain to the C-terminal domain of the molecule (3Ranieri-Raggi M. Montali U. Ronca F. Sabbatini A. Brown P.E. Moir A.J.G. Raggi A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 641-648Google Scholar, 4Borza D.B. Tatum F.M. Morgan W.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1925-1934Google Scholar). On this basis, we may reasonably assume that on SDS/PAGE of the 1m KCl-eluted enzyme under reducing conditions, the HPRG component of AMP deaminase and the catalytic subunit both migrate as 85-kDa species, this observation being probably because of an interaction between the two proteins that further reduces the approachability of β-mercaptoethanol to that disulfide bridge. To establish the extent of the diminution of HPRG content occurring in AMP deaminase as a consequence of the introduction of the washing step with 0.6 m KCl in the phosphocellulose chromatography before the elution of the enzyme with 1.0 m KCl, we compared the yield of the protein obtained from the skeletal muscle of the same rabbit by following either that protocol or the direct elution with 1.0 m KCl after the washing step with 0.45m KCl. The total protein yield in terms of mass was about the same with the two methods, because the protein eluted successively with 0.6 and 1.0 m KCl accounted for about 15 and 85%, respectively, of the total protein eluted with 1.0 m KCl as a single step (Table I). Taking into account the 85-kDa molecular mass of the catalytic subunit of AMP deaminase and assuming for the AMP deaminase associated HPRG the same molecular weight of 58-kDa calculated for the rabbit plasma protein (4Borza D.B. Tatum F.M. Morgan W.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1925-1934Google Scholar), these data are consistent with an approximate 30% diminution of the HPRG content of the phosphocellulose-bound enzyme as consequence of the washing step with 0.6 m KCl.Table IPurification of rabbit skeletal muscle AMP deaminase: elution of the enzyme held by cellulose phosphate after the washing step with 0.45m KClOne-step elution with 1.0 mKClTwo-step elutionWith 0.6 mKClWith 1.0 m KClTotal protein (mg/100 g of muscle)8.5 ± 1.61.0 ± 0.17.0 ± 1.4Activity (units/mg)1700.5210A 280/A 2601.61.21.8The results are the average values of the determinations carried out on two different AMP deaminase preparations.

By following the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures” for the determination of theA 2801%,1 cm, the high value of 12.6 was calculated for this enzyme, in comparison with that of 9.1 obtained for the enzyme purified adopting the 0.6 m KCl washing step. Altogether, these data indicate that elution with 0.6m KCl of the AMP deaminase adsorbed to cellulose phosphate probably removes from the resin a protein-protein complex with an extremely high HPRG/AMP deaminase molar ratio, thereby increasing the specific activity of the enzyme isolated in the successive elution of the column with 1.0 m KCl. It should be noted that AMP deaminase prepared as described in Ref. 15Smiley K.L. Berry A.J. Suelter C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2502-2506Google Scholar from frozen rabbit skeletal muscle showed anA 280:A 260 ratio of 1.8 and an A 2801%,1 cm value of 9.1 (21Zielke C.L. Suelter C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2179-2186Google Scholar). Analysis by sedimentation-equilibrium techniques revealed that that enzyme had a molecular weight of 278,000 (21Zielke C.L. Suelter C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2179-2186Google Scholar), somewhat lower than that calculated for a molecular aggregate of four identical 85-kDa subunits. This observation was previously explained with the finding that freezing of the muscle causes the same 85–70 kDa transition observed with aging of the purified enzyme (8Ranieri-Raggi M. Raggi A. Biochem. J. 1980; 189: 367-368Google Scholar). In contrast, our determination by sedimentation-equilibrium analysis of the molecular mass of freshly prepared rabbit skeletal muscle AMP deaminase in 1m KCl, pH 7.0, indicated the presence of two species of 173 and 309 kDa, which were interpreted as being consistent with the existence of a dimer-tetramer equilibrium (22Ranieri-Raggi M. Raggi A. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 755-759Google Scholar). In the light of the data of the present paper, the heterogeneity observed in sedimentation-equilibrium centrifugation of the native enzyme should be interpreted as being due to the presence of HPRG/AMP deaminase protein-protein complexes with different molar ratio, the observed 309-kDa molecular mass determined for the heavier component being in agreement with a model for AMP deaminase quaternary structure in which two 85-kDa catalytic subunits assemble with two approximately 70-kDa HPRG subunits (assuming a carbohydrate content similar to that of the plasma protein). As far as the effect of the diminution of the HPRG content in the preparation of AMP deaminase on the properties of the enzyme is concerned, comparison of the results obtained with the enzymes prepared by following the two different protocols has not given any evidence of clear differences in the kinetics (results not shown) or in the behavior on SDS/PAGE. However, the HPRG-enriched enzyme showed an apparent reduction in the rate of the proteolytic phenomena with storage; it is evident from Fig. 2 C (lanes 1–5) that both the disappearance of the 95-kDa band and the 85–70-kDa band transition are significantly slower for the HPRG-enriched enzyme. Our sequence data show that the HPRG variant present in the AMP deaminase preparation shares with the plasma protein an almost totally conserved cystatin domain at the N terminus (23Ko"

Here we demonstrate for the first time, using presteady-state active site titrations, that MutY assembles into a dimer upon binding substrate DNA and that the dimer is the functionally active form of the enzyme. Additionally, we observed allosteric inhibition of glycosylase activity in the dimer by the concurrent binding of two lesion mispairs. Active site titration results were independently verified by gel mobility shift assays and quantitative DNA footprint titrations.

The resulting alterations in base-pairing properties (3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D.

The removal of oxidative lesions and the correction of mutagenic mispairing at these lesions, therefore, represent two essential but distinct lines of defense against genome degradations.

MutY, therefore, functions physiologically as a mismatch repair enzyme, as originally suggested (41Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6597-6600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Au K.G. Clark S. Miller J.H. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8877-8881Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), albeit targeted toward adenines misincorporated by DNA polymerase at template 8-oxo-guanines. As such, the accuracy of repair depends on the exclusive removal of adenines from the newly synthesized, daughter strand of DNA. By contrast, MutY repair activity at a mispair where the 8-oxo-guanine has been misincorporated opposite a template adenine would be mutagenic. The observation (43Vidmar J.J. Cupples C.G. Can. J. Microbiol. 1993; 39: 892-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that A:T → C:G transversion frequencies inMutT −/MutY+Escherichia coli is increased relative toMutT −/MutY − strains, whereas the high rate of C:G → A:T mutations inMutY − strains is unaffected by the status ofMutT, corroborates the mutagenic effects of such MutY-mediated removal of adenines from the template strand. However, the generally accepted view of MutY as a prototypical mono-functional base excision glycosylase provides no mechanistic basis for daughter versus template strand selectivity. Interestingly, the human MutY homolog, hMYH, has recently been shown to interact with the human mismatch repair enzyme, hMSHα (44Gu Y. Parker A. Wilson T.M. Bai H. Chang D.-Y. Lu A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11135-11142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), providing the first insight into the mechanistic possibility that nascent strand recognition may result from cooperative recruitment of the mismatch repair system. Even so, such cooperative interaction between different repair systems does not mitigate the need for a regulatory mechanism intrinsic to MutY itself to forestall indiscriminate excision prior to recruitment. Toward this end, we have reexamined the kinetic mechanism of MutY using presteady-state active site titrations to reveal a polysteric and allosteric basis for such a molecular switch. Except as noted, all buffers were made with reagent grade chemicals and Milli-Q Plus (Millipore, Bedford, MA) purified distilled-deionized water. MutY Storage Buffer contained 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, and 50% spectroscopic grade glycerol. MutY Assay Buffer contained 5 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 5% spectroscopic grade glycerol. All buffer stock solutions were filtered through 0.2-μm polyethersulfone filters (Nalgene, Rochester, NY). The E. coli MutY was purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring the overproducing plasmid pET24a/MutY-8 as described previously (53Bernards A.S. Miller J.K. Bao K.K. Wong I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20960-20964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The MutY concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of ε280 = 77,510m−1cm−1. Purified MutY had anA 400 to A 280 ratio between 0.15 and 0.19 and was stored in MutY Storage Buffer at −80 °C. Synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized and further purified by urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electro-elution as described previously (61Bao K.K. Skalka A.M. Wong I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12089-12098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Duplex substrates were constructed by annealing 5′-32P-labeled *t-AAT (5′-CATCAGAACAATTCATCGTTA) with its complement, b-AOT (5′-TAACGATGAAOTGTTCTGATG, O = 8-oxo-guanine) as described (61Bao K.K. Skalka A.M. Wong I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12089-12098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), placing a single adenine:8-oxoguanine mismatch at the center (position 11) of the sequence as denoted by the underscore. Concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using extinction coefficients calculated according to Cantor et al.(62Cantor C.R. Warshaw M.M. Shapiro H. Biopolymers. 1970; 9: 1059-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). T4 polynucleotide kinase was obtained from USB (Cleveland, OH), and [γ32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained fromAmersham Biosciences. Single-turnover experiments were carried out using a KinTek RFQ-3 rapid chemical quench (KinTek Instruments, State College, PA) instrument thermostatically maintained at 37 °C with a Neslab RTE-111 refrigerated water bath. Reactions in MutY Assay Buffer were initiated by rapidly mixing 15 μl of MutY with 15 μl of 5′-32P-labeled duplex DNA substrate and were chemically quenched with 90 μl of 0.2 m NaOH. The abasic site-containing excision products were then heated to 90 °C for 8 min to cleave the phospho-ribose backbone of the DNA at the abasic site to generate 10-nucleotide products, which were separated from the 21-nucleotide substrates by electrophoresis on a 20% acrylamide, 8m urea gel. Following visualization with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), the intensities of DNA substrate and product bands were quantified using ImageQuant software (AmershamBiosciences) as described (47Wong I. Lundquist A.J. Bernards A.S. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19424-19432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 61Bao K.K. Skalka A.M. Wong I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12089-12098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Single-turnover time courses with enzyme present in excess over substrate were fitted to a single exponential function, [P]t = A1(1 −e −k obs t ). First turnover time courses in excess substrate were also fitted to single exponential functions for time courses less than 2 min because of the undetectable contribution of the linear steady-state phase within this time frame. First turnover burst amplitudes were determined by performing excision assay using time points in excess of 4 min. Accurate data could be obtained using a minimal set of three time points at 4, 8, and 12 min; however, time courses were typically linear for up to 2 h. Burst amplitudes were obtained as the y-intercept values returned by the linear regression best fit of the data. Active site titrations consisted of a series of first turnover burst amplitude determinations obtained over a serially diluted range of MutY concentrations at fixed DNA concentrations. The statistical thermodynamic model of Fig. 2 has been described previously in detail (48Wong I. Lohman T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 95-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 49Wong I. Chao K.L. Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7596-7610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fits to active site titrations were modeled after the species fraction of the Y2D complex as given by Equation 1. [Y2D][D]total=K11K1[Y]21+K11[Y]+K11K1[Y]2+2K11K1K22[Y]2[D][Y2D][Y]total=K11K1[Y][D]1+K0[Y]+K11[D]+2K11K1[Y][D]+2K11K1K22[Y][D]2(Eq.1)Nonlinear fits were obtained for all data sets using an adaptive nonlinear regression algorithm (63Dennis J.E. Gray D.M. Welsch R.E. ACM Trans. Math. Softw. 1981; 7: 348-368Crossref Scopus (712) Google Scholar) as implemented in the program NLREG (Phillip H. Sherrod, Brentwood, TN). Fractions of DNA found in the Y2D2 and YD subpopulations were simulated according to Equations 2 and 3.[Y2D2][D]total=2K11K1K22[Y]2[D]1+K11[Y]+K11K1[Y]2+2K11K1K22[Y]2[D]Equation 2 [YD][D]total=K11[Y]1+K11[Y]+K11K1[Y]2+2K11K1K22[Y]2[D]Equation 3 Simulated curves shown were generated using KaleidaGraph v.3.51 (Synergy Software, PA) as described (48Wong I.

Chem. 1992; 267: 7596-7610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydroxyl-radical (Fe-EDTA) footprint titrations were adapted from published protocols (50Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Proc.

Duplex tAAT:bAOT (100 nm), radiolabeled either in the adenine, *tAAT, or 8-oxo-guanine strand, *bAOT, were incubated with MutY at 37 °C in Assay Buffer containing 2% glycerol for 30 s prior to the addition of 25 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate, 50 μm EDTA, 5 mm sodium ascorbate, and 0.24% H2O2 followed by further incubation at room temperature for 8 min. Reactions were quenched by transfer to prechilled tubes containing ice-cold 25% glycerol, 4 mthiourea, and 4 m urea. Elevated ascorbate and H2O2 concentrations used were optimally calibrated to account for the presence of the 2% glycerol. Conversely, inclusion of the usual 5% glycerol in the assay buffer inhibited DNA cleavage. Footprints were visualized following separation by denaturing PAGE in 8 m urea and Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) on an AmershamBiosciences PhosphorImager. Intensities of bands corresponding to protected regions, designated as I f,i, were quantified using ImageQuant software and compared with the intensities of reference bands outside of the footprint region, designated asI b,i, to correct for background variability between lanes. The corrected intensity at each i thconcentration of MutY was further normalized against the corrected intensity in the absence of MutY to obtain the normalized intensity,I norm,i, according to Equation 4, Inorm,i=If,iIb,iIf,0Ib,0Equation 4 where I f,0 andI b,0 represent the intensities of the footprint and reference bands, respectively, in the absence of MutY. The extent of binding at each MutY concentration,θ i, was calculated for each concentration of MutY by normalizing against the maximum extent of protection observed,I norm,∞, by Equation 5,θi=1−Inorm,i1−Inorm,∞Equation 5 where I norm,∞ was obtained by averaging normalized intensities at saturation. Gel mobility shift assays were performed in MutY Assay Buffer without glycerol at 6, 8, 10, and 12% acrylamide using a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN 3 apparatus. Using a 10-well comb, samples were prepared in MutY Assay Buffer with glycerol and loaded into the central two wells of each gel. Sample buffer containing bromphenol blue was loaded into the remaining wells. Electrophoresis was carried out at 70 V for 40 min at room temperature. Due to the poor buffering capacity of the MutY Assay Buffer, the pH in the outer lanes would drop during the course of the run as indicated by a color change of the bromphenol blue tracking dye from blue to yellow. Care was, therefore, taken to calibrate the time of electrophoresis to maintain blue coloring in the tracking dye of the lanes immediately adjacent to the innermost, sample-containing lanes. Inclusion of glycerol in the gel buffer as well as electrophoresis at reduced temperatures both exacerbated the pH artifact. For presteady-state assay of MutY activity, we radiolabeled the adenine-containing strand of a 21-bp duplex substrate, *tAAT:bAOT, which contained a centrally positioned adenine:8-oxo-guanine mispair. The base-labile abasic product was cleaved in 0.2 n NaOH at 80 °C to generate a shortened 10-mer, which was separated from the 21-mer substrate by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In a typical single-turnover assay performed with 4-fold molar excess of MutY (200 nm) over substrate (50 nm), we observed rapid, single-exponential excision of 98 ± 2% of the mispaired adenine at 0.24 ± 0.01 s−1, (Fig. 1 A, closed circles). In experiments performed with excess substrate (200 nm) over enzyme (50 nm), however, only 20 ± 0.4% of the substrates were turned over in the exponential phase but with the identical rate constant of 0.22 ± 0.01 s−1 (open circles). Data obtained at longer times (Fig. 1 B) showed that a presteady-state burst of product was formed in the first turnover followed by steady-state turnovers at 2 × 10−6 s−1 corresponding to the slow rate of one or more product release step(s) that limited the regeneration of free active sites. The amplitude of the burst phase, therefore, provided a direct measure of the molar amount of productively bound substrate during the initial turnover (45Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A.

In active site titrations, burst amplitudes were measure at different MutY and DNA concentrations. The resulting titration curves, plotted as a function of MutY concentration (Fig. 2 A), were sigmoidal at eight different DNA concentrations ranging from 10 to 600 nm. At saturating DNA concentrations (>200 nm), complete binding of substrate required a 2-fold excess of MutY, limiting the reaction stoichiometry to ≤2. However, the nonlinear response at lower MutY concentrations ruled out a monomeric oligomeric species with a single binding site (48Wong I. Lohman T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 95-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 49Wong I. Chao K.L. Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7596-7610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further clarify the apparent reaction stoichiometry, we reconstructed the titration data to reflect the fractional occupancy of total available active sites as a function of increasing DNA concentrations at various fixed concentrations of MutY (Fig. 2 B). The titration curves were linearly dependent on DNA concentration up to ∼45% saturation of active site corresponding to a reaction stoichiometry of two MutY monomers per substrate molecule. Addition of DNA beyond this point, however, resulted in decreased burst amplitudes. As mass action dictated that the addition of DNA ligand must lead to additional total binding, the decline in burst amplitude demonstrated allosteric inhibition of the initial population of two-to-one active complexes by the binding of a second equivalent of substrate. Furthermore, the reduction in burst amplitudes was not accompanied by any change in exponential time course of the first turnover (Fig. 1 A); therefore, the binding of the second substrate abolished, rather than attenuated, the excision activity of the dimer. Our results demonstrate that the active form of MutY is a half-saturated dimeric, Y2D, whose excision activity is allosterically inhibited upon binding a second substrate to form the fully saturated dimer-DNA complex, Y2D2. Identical results were obtained using MutY purified by other protocols including enzyme refolded from guanidine-solubilized inclusion bodies (data not shown). To quantitatively model this allosteric regulation, we used a general statistical thermodynamic scheme (Fig. 3 A) developed previously to describe the protein assembly and DNA binding properties of dimeric proteins (48Wong I. Lohman T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 95-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 49Wong I. Chao K.L. Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7596-7610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The model required four interaction parameters to describe the dynamic equilibrium between two monomeric states, Y and YD, and three dimeric states, Y2,Y2D, and Y2D2.K 0 describes the protein-protein dimerization constant in the absence of bound DNA. K 11describes the DNA binding affinity of the monomer for DNA.K 1 describes the dimerization constant between a DNA-bound monomer and a free monomer to form the half-saturated dimer, Y2D. Lastly, K 22 describes the DNA affinity of Y2D for a second DNA molecule to form the fully saturated dimer, Y2D2. The two remaining equilibrium constants, K 2 andK 21, were constrained by thermodynamic linkage to the values of K 0, K 1,K 11, and K 22. Lastly, the value of K 0, the dimerization constant in the absence of substrate, was arbitrarily fixed at 10 mm−1 as gel filtration chromatography experiments showed that MutY was monomeric in the absence of DNA even at micromolar concentrations (data not shown). Previously, we have shown that titration data obtained at four different DNA concentrations were sufficient to yield satisfactory resolution of the fitted interaction parameters in global nonlinear regression analysis using this model (48Wong I. Lohman T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 95-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nonlinear best fit of the active site titrations obtained at eight DNA concentrations to this model showed excellent global agreement between the burst amplitudes and the species population of Y2D predicted by the model (Fig. 2, solid lines) at all DNA and MutY concentrations, yielding the values for K 1,K 11, and K 22 shown in Table I. Simulations were insensitive to values of K 0 < 40 mm−1, confirming our assumption that the unliganded dimer is sparsely populated and validating the value ofK 0 chosen for the fitting. DNA binding to the monomer was relatively weak (K 11 = 6 μm−1) but was strongly linked to protein dimerization with a 5 order of magnitude increase in dimerization constant (K 1 = 3 nm−1) upon binding DNA, placing the affinity for the DNA by Y2, the unliganded dimer, at K 21 > 450 nm−1 (K d, 21 < 2.2 pm). This positive polysteric linkage between DNA binding and protein oligomerization thermodynamically guaranteed near stoichiometric binding of DNA by a MutY dimer despite the weak affinity of the monomer for DNA. The active half-saturated dimer, Y2D, however, bound the second equivalent of DNA much more weakly, with K 22 = 1.5 μm−1. This negative cooperativity of binding by Y2D coupled with the negative allosteric inhibition of excision activity by the second bound lesion together accounted for the apparent gradual decline of burst amplitude observed at higher DNA concentrations.Table IEquilibrium Constants1-1 Bold face denotes values returned by nonlinear regression analysis. Values shown in italics are either independently constrained (K 0) or calculated. Open table in a new tab 1-1 Bold face denotes values returned by nonlinear regression analysis. Values shown in italics are either independently constrained (K 0) or calculated. Fig. 3 B shows the population distribution of all DNA-bound species for an active site titration at 300 nm DNA. As expected, the data correlated well with the sigmoidal accumulation of Y2D with increasing MutY added. At low MutY concentrations, however, the high ratio of DNA to MutY favored the formation of species with a one-to-one binding stoichiometry. Accordingly, the fully saturated species, Y2D2, was maximally populated at equimolar concentrations of MutY and DNA (300 nm) but disproportionated to form Y2D at higher MutY concentrations. Because Y2D2 lacked excision activity, the adenine:8-oxo-guanine mismatches of DNA bound in this configuration were silent in active site titrations, thereby giving rise to the sigmoidal behavior observed. Because the DNA-bound monomer, YD, accounted for only ∼2% of the DNA bound at this DNA concentration due to the strong positive polysteric linkage, we are less certain that YD also lacked excision activity. However, fits to any model with full excision activity by YD tended to systematically lessen the sigmoidality of the resulting titration curves at all DNA concentrations, compelling us to hypothesize that the monomer is inactive. Because the model proposes the existence of a silent Y2D2 state, we performed hydroxyl-radical DNA footprint (50Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5469-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) titrations to directly monitor all site-specific DNA interactions (51Brenowitz M. Senear D.F. Shea M.A. Ackers G.K. Proc. Natl.

Fig. 4 A shows sequencing gels of footprint titrations performed in parallel using duplex substrate DNA radiolabeled either on the adenine strand, *tAAT (left), or on the 8-oxo-guanine strand, *bAOT (right). The adventitious lyase activity of MutY resulted in partial strand cleavage at the position of the scissile adenine, which was visible in the *tAAT footprint. Additionally, a distinct, MutY-dependent footprint covering 2–3 nucleotides was observed immediately 5′ of the scissile adenine. The footprint on the 8-oxo-guanine strand, *bAOT, covered 4–5 nucleotides and appeared to be centered about the 8-oxo-guanine. Quantitation of the extent of protection by MutY (Fig. 4 B) revealed different protein concentration dependences for the observed footprints on the two strands of DNA. The protection of the adenine strand was sigmoidal and correlated well with both the active site titration data and the predict"

C3 is a by-product of the processing of pro-collagen by pro-collagenase C (or BMP-1), preliminary to the formation of collagen fibrils (5Kessler E. Takahara K. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Greenspan D.S.

We investigated whether MDA MB231 breast carcinoma cells, which are stimulated by mature osteoblasts CM to directional migration, are induced by C3 to activate migratory and proliferation responses. It is recognized that the stroma of the tumors plays instructive and active roles toward tumor cells growth and invasiveness and that tumor-associated stromal fibroblasts undergo changes in the biosynthetic phenotype (6Kauppila S.

We focused the study on a breast carcinoma-derived cell line because it is known that stromal fibroblasts of breast tumors synthesize type I collagen (6Kauppila S. Stenback F. Risteli J. Jukkola A. Risteli L. J. Pathol. 1998; 186: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and high expression of type I collagen in the stroma correlates with worse prognosis and high invasiveness in vivo (10Jukkola A. Tahtela R. Tholix E. Vuorinen K. Blanco G. Risteli L. Risteli J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5517-5520PubMed Google Scholar). Molecules, produced and localized in the microenvironment of the stroma shared by tumor and endothelial cells and capable of inducing in both cell types directional migration and/or cell proliferation and peri-cellular proteolysis, might behave as promoters for the overall development of primary tumors and for the establishment of metastasis. No such molecule has been yet described, and C3 presents itself as a likely candidate for this role. Tumor cells invasion and angiogenesis share mechanistic analogies and the common feature of presenting high expression of metalloproteinases (MMP) and/or serine proteinases, in particular the urokinase (uPA) system, and/or their activation. In both tumor and endothelial cells the enhancement of peri-cellular proteolysis and the acquisition of the migratory phenotype can occur in response to various extracellular matrix components or to factors stored within it, mediated through engagement of integrins, growth factors receptors, and activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins (13Parent C.A.

Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Increased expression and activation of pro-MMPs play multiple roles during angiogenesis and tumor growth and invasion as follows: modulation of tight cell-cell and cell-ECM relationships, control of tissue homeostasis, proteolysis, release from the ECM of growth factors, and of protein fragments with distinct biological activities (15Hanahan D.

MMPs regulate tumor cell growth, at both primary and metastatic sites. Increased expression of pro-MMP-2 and -9 is associated to the metastatic behavior of most tumors, including breast carcinoma, and in vitro the production of active forms of MMPs is associated with the induction of migratory behavior in cancer cells (18Chambers A.F.

The uPA system determines the controlled proteolysis of ECM, regulated by a complex network of feedback mechanisms and by the balancing in amount of proteinases (tPA and uPA), their inhibitors (PAIs), and the uPA receptor (uPAR). It is involved in the activation of secreted and ECM-associated growth factors, in cell adhesion, migration, cytoskeleton reorganization, in MMP-9 and -14 activation (27Okumura Y. Sato H. Seiki M.

The effects of these interactions are the control of localized proteolysis, through regulation of proteinase function and/or directional migration. In ovarian carcinoma cells in collagen gels β1 integrin controls the expression of MMP-14 and MMP-2 (48Shaw L.M. Rabinowitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A. Mercurio A.M.

In tumor cells different integrins interacting with different ECM proteins can therefore regulate the expression of secreted and transmembrane MMPs, and supermolecular complexes of integrins with transmembrane and/or secreted MMPs, and/or uPA and uPAR, can regulate in turn both peri-cellular proteolysis, cell migration, and cell proliferation. In endothelial cells the directional migration induced by C3 requires the function of α1, β1, and β3 integrins and is inhibited by pertussis toxin (PTX) (4Palmieri D. Camardella L. Ulivi V. Guasco G. Manduca P. J. Biol.

All of these signaling pathways are also, directly or in a cooperative fashion, capable of affecting the progression of the cell cycle and/or the cell death by apoptosis (39Giancotti F.G. Nat.

Cell. 2001; 8: 115-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The mechanistic aspects of this signaling are still largely unraveled. In this study we investigated if purified C3 causes the induction of directional migration and proliferation and/or apoptosis of human breast carcinoma cell lines. We used inhibitors and antibodies to investigate which proteinases and receptors and which elements of the molecular machinery of cell signaling are involved in the induction of the migratory process by C3. Rat tibial osteoblasts cultures (ROB) were obtained as described (1Stringa E. Filanti C. Giunciuglio D. Albini A. Manduca P. Bone (New York). 1995; 16: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and expanded in Coon's-modified F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Seromed, Italy). Cultures at 46–70 cumulative population doublings were utilized for the preparation of conditioned medium in differentiation medium (100 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate) (53Manduca P. Palermo C. Caruso C. Brizzolara A. Sanguineti C. Filanti C. Zicca A. Bone (New York). 1997; 21: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). MDA MB231, MDA MB435, MCF-7, and ZR75.1 breast cancer cell line (courtesy of Prof. S. Toma, Università di Genova, Italy) and endothelial cells, EA hy926, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FCS. Conditioned media were collected from mature rat osteoblasts in the second phase of osteogenesis (after 7–10 days of culture in differentiation medium) in vitro, and C3 was purified as described (4Palmieri D. Camardella L. Ulivi V. Guasco G. Manduca P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32658-32663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The fractions obtained from the heparin-Sepharose column were tested in chemotaxis with endothelial and MDA MB231 cells. Cells were plated in the presence of serum, and after allowing cell attachment, the medium was removed, and cultures were rinsed with serum-free medium (SFM) and maintained in SFM, with or without purified C3 (13 μg/ml), or 10% FCS. In the presence of C3, cells loosened their attachment to the plastic. We therefore separately analyzed at each time point cells easily detaching and detached and those adhering to the plastic for the numbers of mitosis and apoptosis. Because no significant differences were detected in their frequency in the two fractions, we report the sum of the two fractions. Mitotic and apoptotic indexes were determined, after 48 or 72 h, in cells fixed and stained in 50 μg/ml Hoechst for 20 min. At least 1000 cells/sample were counted in-blind by two observers, and standard error was calculated. Experiments were performed in duplicate. Migration assay was performed in Boyden chambers as described (4Palmieri D. Camardella L. Ulivi V. Guasco G. Manduca P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32658-32663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 12 × 104 cells were placed in the upper compartment of each Boyden chamber, and unfractionated CM, purified C3 (13 μg/ml), or SFM for negative control were placed in the lower compartment. In the study of the effects on migration of antibodies against the C3 chains α1 and α2, these were added to the lower compartment of the Boyden chamber. To study the effects on migration of antibodies against MMPs, uPA, and integrins, and in that of TIMP-1, GM6001, PAI, PTX, wortmannin, and genistein, these were added with the cells in the upper compartment. The concentrations of antibodies against β1, β3 integrin chains, against MMP-2 and -9, and against the α1 and α2chains of type I collagen were chosen as effective in the inhibition of C3-induced endothelial cell migration. After migration five random fields of the filters were counted for each sample; the standard deviation was calculated and indicated in the figures. Duplicate samples were run in each experiment, and the experiments were repeated at least twice. To study the expression by cells of MMPs and uPA upon induction with C3, the media conditioned during the chemotaxis by the tumor cancer cells (the upper compartment of the Boyden chamber) were collected. In other experiments tumor cells grown to confluence on plastic were challenged with C3 (13 μg/ml) in SFM for 6 h or cultured for the same time in SFM, and the CM were collected. In 6 h attached cells do not lose their attachment to the plastic. Cells lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS). Anti-human antibodies utilized for inhibition of migration were to integrin β1(monoclonal AIIB2, courtesy of Dr. C. Damsky, University of California), integrin β1 (monoclonal antibody 6S6, Chemicon, Temecula, CA), integrin β3 (monoclonal antibody B212, courtesy of Dr. G. Tarone, University of Torino, Italy), integrin α2 (monoclonal antibody A2-IIE10, Sigma), integrin α6 (monoclonal antibody 135-13C, courtesy of Dr. Kennel, Ornel Life Science Division, Oak Ridge, TN), α1 and α2 chains of the COOH-terminal of procollagen type I (polyclonal antibody, courtesy of Dr. A. Veis, Northwestern University, Chicago), MMP-2 and -9 (polyclonal antibody, courtesy of Dr. W. Stettler Stevenson, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda), MMP-14 (polyclonal antibody, Biotrend, Koln, Germany), and uPA (monoclonal antibody, Calbiochem). Anti-human uPAR (monoclonal antibody R4, courtesy of Dr. F. Blasi, S. Raffaele, Milano, Italy), TIMP-1 (polyclonal antibody, Chemicon), and TIMP-2 (monoclonal antibody 13446, Chemicon) were utilized for Western blotting. Inhibitors utilized were TIMP-1 (human recombinant, Chemicon), PAI (human recombinant, Chemicon), and GM6001 (Chemicon). All other chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were from Sigma. Samples of CM were concentrated by cold ethanol precipitation (46:100, v/v) for 1.5 h on ice, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in sample buffer for electrophoresis. Protein equivalent amounts (by Lowry) from CM were loaded on SDS-acrylamide gel. The gels for detection of uPAs were cast with 1% non-fat dry milk and 10 μg/ml human plasminogen and run at 6−8 °C in a water-cooled box. After electrophoresis, gels were washed twice in 2.5% Triton X-100, incubated 16–18 h at 37 °C in 100 mm glycine, pH 8.0, stained with 0.2% Coomassie Blue in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and destained in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid. The gels for detection of MMPs were cast with 0.28% w/v gelatin (type A), run at 6–8 °C in a water-cooled box, rinsed twice for 30 min in 2.5% Triton X-100, incubated 16–18 h at 37 °C in 40 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, stained, and destained as above. 50 μg of proteins from cells lysed in RIPA buffer were run after reduction on SDS-acrylamide gels. The samples were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose, and the membranes were saturated at room temperature for 1 h in TTBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20), 5% bovine serum albumin. The membranes were incubated 16 h in TTBS added with monoclonal R4 anti-uPAR, polyclonal anti-MMP-14, polyclonal anti-MMP-2, polyclonal anti-TIMP-1, or monoclonal anti-TIMP-2 antibodies, followed by 1 h in TTBS with horseradish peroxidase-secondary antibody, and the bands were visualized by ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). C3, the inducer of directional migration specific for endothelial cells, is purified from medium conditioned by mature rat osteoblasts. Fig. 1 A shows that the chemoattractant for both endothelial (EA hy926) and breast carcinoma (MDA MB231) cells is found in the same fractions of the last purification step, a heparin-Sepharose column. A pool of these fractions yields on SDS-PAGE a single band at 120 kDa, unreduced, and a doublet"
https://openalex.org/W2081501085,"Endothelin (EDN) receptor type B (EDNRB) activates serum response factor (SRF) via Gq/11 and G12/13 G proteins. In this study, we investigated the involvement of intracellular loop sequences of EDNRB in coupling to these G proteins. EDNRB mutants were generated and tested for their abilities to activate SRF in NIH3T3 cells and in the mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line (Fq/11) lacking both Gαqand Gα11. EDNRB can activate SRF in NIH3T3 cells via Gq/11, although it can only activate SRF through G12/13 in Fq/11 cells. Mutants with mutations in the second and third inner loops of EDNRB functioned in the same manner in both cell lines, either able or unable to activate SRF. This finding suggests that the second and third inner loops of EDNRB either participate or not in coupling to both Gq/11 and G12/13 but are not specific for either one. However, in the first inner loop, a substitution of three Ala residues for Met128-Arg129-Asn130abolished the ability to activate SRF only in Fq/11 cells, suggesting that this mutation might specifically disrupt the coupling to G12/13 rather than to Gq/11. Further characterization of this first inner loop mutant revealed that exogenous expression of Gα12 or Gαq could restore SRF activation, whereas the expression of Gα13did not. Therefore, we conclude that although the three intracellular loops of EDNRB may be involved in coupling to G proteins, residues Met128-Arg129-Asn130 in the first intracellular loop are specifically required for activation of Gα13.

Polokoff M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 325-415PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, there are at least two EDN receptor subtypes, EDNRA and EDNRB. The EDN receptors belong to the superfamily of rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that contain seven transmembrane domains. The extracellular and transmembrane domains of GPCRs are involved in ligand binding, whereas the intracellular domains are involved in G protein coupling and subsequent effector regulation. Both EDN receptors can couple to Gq proteins, resulting in the activation of phospholipase Cβ (2Takigawa M. Sakurai T. Kasuya Y. Abe Y. Masaki T. Goto K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This pathway was shown to be necessary for EDN-induced activation of the ERK/MAPK signaling cascade (3Cramer H. Schmenger K. Heinrich K. Horstmeyer A. Boning H. Breit A. Piiper A. Lundstrom K. Muller-Esterl W. Schroeder C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5449-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, EDN receptors were also found to regulate adenylyl cyclases through both Gs and Gi (2Takigawa M. Sakurai T. Kasuya Y. Abe Y. Masaki T. Goto K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). More recently, EDN receptors were demonstrated to couple to the G12 subfamily of G proteins that consists of G12 and G13 (4Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition, EDNRA was shown to induce stress fiber formation via Gα12 in fibroblast cells (5Gohla A. Offermanns S. Wilkie T.M. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17901-17907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), whereas EDNRB was shown to couple to Gα13 in human HEK-293 cells (6Kitamura K. Shiraishi N. Singer W.D. Handlogten M.E. Tomita K. Miller R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C930-C937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because many GPCRs can couple to more than one Gα subunit, understanding the structural basis for specificity between a receptor and its respective G proteins is an area of active investigation (7Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar,8Wess J. FASEB. J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). For example, the amino acid sequences involved in Gαqactivation have been mapped to the third inner loops of the α1B-adrenergic receptor, the mt1 muscarinic receptor, and the glutamate receptors (9Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Kjelsberg M.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1633-1639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pin J.-P. Joly C. Heinemann S.F. Bockaert J.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4381-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Our own work has identified two basic amino acids in the second inner loop of the interleukin-8 receptor that is required for Gα16 coupling (12Xie W. Jiang H., Wu, Y. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24948-24951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The structural specificity of G protein coupling has also been demonstrated in EDNRs. Studies using various receptor chimeras demonstrate that the second inner loop of EDNRA is involved in Gαs coupling, whereas the third inner loop of EDNRB receptor is responsible for Gαi coupling (13Takagi Y. Ninomiya H. Sakamoto A. Miwa S. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10072-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, EDNRs are modified by palmitoylation at a cluster of cysteine residues in the C-terminal tails, which also appear to play a role in G protein coupling (14Aquilla E. Whelchel A. Knot H.J. Nelson M. Posada J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31572-31579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the molecular basis of Gα12/13 coupling to EDNRB. Taking advantage of a previously established reporter gene assay system in NIH3T3 and Fq/11 cells (derived from embryos in which the genes for Gαq and Gα11 were disrupted) (4Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 15Offermanns S. Zhao L.P. Gohla A. Sarosi I. Simon M.I. Wilkie T.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4304-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), we identified three residues in the first inner loop of EDNRB as required for specific activation of Gα13. NIH3T3 and Fq/11 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The Fq/11 cell line was established from mice lacking both Gαq and Gα11 (4Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For transfection, cells (5×104 cells/well) were seeded into 24-well plates the day before transfection. Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of DNA/well using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) as suggested by the manufacturer. Transfection was stopped after 3 h by switching to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Cell extracts were collected 30 h later for luciferase assays. Luciferase assays were performed using a Constant Light luciferase assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as instructed. Cell lysates were first determined for the fluorescence intensity emitted by GFP proteins in a Wallac Victor2 Multicounter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) followed by luminescence measurement by using the same counter after the addition of the luciferase substrate. Luminescence intensities were normalized against fluorescence intensities as described previously (4Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 10 μCi/ml of myo-[2-3H]inositol in 0.25 ml of inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 24 h. The levels of inositol phosphates were determined as described previously (17Wu D. Lee C.-H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NIH3T3 or Fq/11 cells in 24-well plates were transfected with the cDNAs encoding the EDNRB or its mutants. After 24 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with varying amounts of [125I]EDN1 (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin, the cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of 0.2 n NaOH and 0.1-ml aliquots were taken for counting in a γ-ray counter. The nonspecific binding was determined by measuring the binding of [125I]EDN1 to cells transfected with the LacZ expression plasmid. The number of specific EDN1 binding sites (B max) and dissociation constants (K d) were calculated using the Scatchard analysis. All EDNRB mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction with the high fidelity DNAPfu polymerase (Stratagene), and each of the mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing and restriction digestion. Hemagglutinin epitope tags were incorporated at the C termini of EDNRB and its mutants. NIH3T3 cells expressing LacZ, ENDRB, or its mutants were lysed in the SDS-PAGE sample buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before electrophoretic separation in 10% acrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were blotted to nitrocellular membranes and probed with an anti-hemagglutinin antibody. Previously, we demonstrated that EDNRB could couple to G12/13 (4Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To further understand the interaction between EDNRB and G12/13, we generated a series of receptor mutants in which the intracellular loop regions were mutated and tested for their ability to activate SRF in NIH3T3 and Fq/11 cells. Because previous work has found that residues in the third inner loop of GPCRs were frequently found to be involved in G protein coupling (7Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 8Wess J. FASEB. J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 9Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9828-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we first tested receptor mutants with deletions in the third inner loop of EDNRB as illustrated in Fig. 1 A for their ability to activate SRF (Fig. 1, B and C). Our previous studies have demonstrated that EDNRB activated SRF via coupling to both Gq/11 and G12/13 proteins in NIH3T3 cells, whereas EDNRB activated SRF via G12 and/or G13in Fq/11 cells (4Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, B andC, EDN1 could activate SRF in NIH3T3 or Fq/11cells expressing mt1, mt2, mt4, or mt6 (Fig. 1, B andC) but not in cells expressing mt3 or mt5. Because the mutation in mt5, which covers the mutation in mt3, did not affect ligand-binding characteristics (Table I), we conclude that the amino acids deleted in mt5 are probably required for coupling to both Gαq/11 and Gα12/13. In addition, the sequences deleted in mt1, mt2, mt4, and mt6 do not appear to be essential for coupling to either Gq/11 or G12/13.Table IBinding of [ 125 I]EDN1 in NIH3T3 cellsK dB maxnm(receptors/cell) × 10 −6WT0.281.2mt50.301.3mt70.271.1mt80.241.3mt100.291.2The binding assay was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The nonspecific binding as measured withlacZ-transfected cells is <15% of corresponding total binding. Open table in a new tab The binding assay was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The nonspecific binding as measured withlacZ-transfected cells is <15% of corresponding total binding. We went on generating two additional mutants that contain deletions spanning the short second inner loop (Fig. 2 A). Both mutants failed to activate SRF in response to EDN1 in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2 B). Given that neither of the mutations affected ligand binding (Table I), it is probable that these mutations knock out coupling to multiple G proteins. We also made a C-terminal deletion mutant with a deletion up to residue Cys405, a myristoylation site. This C-terminal deletion mutant showed increased responses to EDN1 in both 3T3 and Fq/11 cells (data not shown), probably because of the removal of desensitization signals localized at the C-terminal tail of the receptor as found with many other GPCRs (16Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 21Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Thus far, specific mutations in the second and third inner loops of EDNRB have functioned in a similar manner in both cell lines. This suggests that althogh certain regions of the second and third inner loops are essential for G protein coupling, they are not specific for any particular G protein. Therefore, we shifted our focus to the first inner loop. In this segment, there are two sets of triple amino acids that contain basic or polar residues. We mutated these sites with three Ala residues, respectively (Fig. 3 A). In 3T3 cells, the expression of mt9 and mt10 led to marked increases in the luciferase activity in response to EDN1 (Fig. 3 B). However, mt10 failed to induce SRF activation in Fq/11 cells, whereas mt9 could still activate SRF in response to EDN1 almost as well as the wild type receptor. Similar results were obtained with two other doses of EDN1 (Fig. 4, A and B). This finding suggests that the three residues (Met128-Arg129-Asn130) in the first inner loop of EDNRB are required for specific coupling to the G13 and/or G12 proteins but not to the Gq proteins. For further confirmation, exogenous Gα13, Gα12, or Gαq was expressed in Fq/11 cells by transfection. Mutant mt10 was unable to activate SRF in response to EDN1 (Fig. 4 C) when Gα13 was expressed, confirming that this mutant receptor is unable to couple to G13. Interestingly, when Gα12 was expressed, EDN1-induced SRF activation was restored (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that residues Met128-Arg129-Asn130 are required for specific coupling to Gα13 but not to Gα12. The reason for the failure of activation of SRF in the absence of transfected Gα12 might be because of a low or no expression of endogenous Gα12 in these embryonic cells. As anticipated, the expression of Gq also restored the ability of mt10 to activate SRF in response to EDN1 (Fig. 4 C), confirming that mt10 can couple to Gq. The ability of mt10 to couple to the Gq proteins was also validated by the finding that EDN1 could stimulate the accumulation of inositol phosphates in NIH3T3 cells expressing mt10 (data not shown). Moreover, the ability of the wild type receptor to increase reporter gene activity in the presence exogenous Gα13, Gα12, or Gαq in F q/11 cells indicates that ENDRB is capable of coupling Gα13 and that the inability of mt10 to activate SRF in the presence of exogenous Gα13 is not because of insufficient expression of Gα13 in the Fq/11 cells. Furthermore, ligand-binding analyses, which were carried out in both NIH3T3 and Fq/11 cells (Fig. 5 and Tables I and II), did not reveal obvious differences between mt10 and the wild type receptor in the values of both B max and K d, suggesting that mt10 was expressed normally at the cell surfaces of both NIH3T3 and Fq/11 cells. Putting all of these results together, we conclude that residues Met128-Arg129-Asn130 in the first inner loop of EDNRB are involved in specific coupling to Gα13 but not to Gα12 or Gq.Figure 4Specific coupling of EDNRB mutant mt10 to G13.

The structural determinants of receptor G protein coupling have been pursued vigorously in the past. Although no consensus sequences have been identified, specific sequences in individual receptors have been identified for coupling to distinct G proteins (7Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 8Wess J. FASEB. J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The coupling elements are often found in the third inner loops of various GPCRs with a few exceptions. For instance, the coupling of the interleukin-8 receptor to Gα16 and the EDNRA receptor to Gαs was mapped to the second inner loop (13Takagi Y. Ninomiya H. Sakamoto A. Miwa S. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10072-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Offermanns S. Zhao L.P. Gohla A. Sarosi I. Simon M.I. Wilkie T.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4304-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). As for EDNRB, different elements had previously been found to be required for coupling to Gq and Gi proteins (13Takagi Y. Ninomiya H. Sakamoto A. Miwa S. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10072-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate for the first time that the first inner loop of a GPCR is required for specific coupling to a G protein. Although distinct sequence elements have been found for specific coupling to different G proteins, evidence also suggests that there may be multiple contacts made between a GPCR and a given G protein. It appears that there might also be some common sequences that are required for coupling to different G proteins. For example, the sequences deleted in mt5, mt7, and mt8 appeared to be required for coupling to both G13 and Gq proteins. However, although we have demonstrated that these mutations do not affect ligand-binding characteristics, we cannot eliminate the possibility that the mutations disrupt certain structures formed by the intracellular loops, which rather than the sequences themselves are required for G protein coupling. Nevertheless, the third inner loop sequences of many GPCRs, particularly those near the sixth transmembrane domain, appear to be critical in coupling to Gq and Gi (7Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 8Wess J. FASEB. J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). In this report, we added G13 to that list. Identification of mutations that can specifically knock out the coupling of EDNRB to G13 lays the groundwork for future investigations of specific physiological significance of the EDNRB-Gα13 signaling pathway. The importance of EDN in the cardiovascular system has been well documented (1Rubanyi G.M. Polokoff M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 325-415PubMed Google Scholar). Not long ago, G13 was also found to play an important role in vasculature regulation because mice lacking Gα13 died from vasculature malfunction (18Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In addition, the inactivation of theEDNRB gene produced a megacolon associated with spotted coat color in mice (19Hosoda K. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Baynash A.G. Cheung J.C. Giaid A. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1267-1276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Similar phenotypes are also manifested in patients with Hirschsprunger's disease. It would be very interesting to determine whether the EDNR-Gα13 signaling pathway is involved in these processes. Our finding provides a potential tool for such an investigation. We thank Peter Maye for comments on the paper."

To determine whether the binding region serves merely to recruit the RNA polymerase (RNAP) to the vicinity of a melted initiation region or provides other functions, we utilized a GAL4-T7 RNAP fusion protein to provide an independent binding capacity to the RNAP. When the GAL4-T7 RNAP was recruited to a single-stranded (ss) promoter via a nearby Gal4 recognition sequence, no transcription was observed.

These findings have potential implications with regard to mechanisms of promoter binding and melting. RNA polymerase nucleotide wild type double-stranded single-stranded partially single-stranded template non-template To initiate transcription, RNA polymerases (RNAP)1 must locate and bind to a promoter region, separate the two DNA stands near the start site, and position the template strand in the active center. Understanding how this process occurs is important to our knowledge of the transcription process. As is the situation with other RNAPs, promoters for T7 RNA polymerase have a bipartite structure that consists of an upstream binding region that is recognized in a sequence-specific manner and an initiation region that must be melted open prior to initiation (1Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). The binding region (−17 to −5) appears to function independently of the initiation region, and a double-stranded (ds) DNA fragment that contains only this region of the promoter is tightly bound by the RNAP (2Ujvari A. Martin C.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The binding region is recognized only in the form of duplex DNA, and removal of either the template (T) or non-template (NT) strands in this region prevents polymerase binding (3Maslak M. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4281-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast, the NT strand in the initiation region is not required for initiation, and a partially single-stranded (pss) promoter in which this strand has been removed downstream of −4 (essentially a “premelted promoter”) allows efficient and accurate initiation (3Maslak M. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4281-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A variety of lines of evidence suggests that the binding and initiation regions function independently and that it may be possible to physically separate the two while retaining promoter function. In the crystal structure of a T7 RNAP-promoter complex, as well as in an initiation complex in which the first 3 bases in the template strand have been transcribed, the two promoter domains are observed to interact with separate regions of the RNAP (4Cheetham G. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 5Cheetham G. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a number of structural changes that disrupt the linkage between the binding and initiation regions do not prevent initiation. These include the introduction of non-nucleosidic linkers into the T strand between these two regions, as well as interruption or removal of a portion of the T strand that lies between the binding region and the start site of transcription (nicked or gapped promoters) (6Weston B.F. Kuzmine I. Martin C.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 7Jiang M. Rong M. Martin C.T. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 310: 509-522Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The question arises, then, as to whether the binding region serves merely to recruit the RNAP to a (melted) region of the template that is suitable for initiation or whether its interaction with the RNAP is required for other functions during initiation and isomerization to a stable elongation complex. To answer this question, we took advantage of a Gal4:T7 RNAP fusion protein in which the yeast Gal4 binding domain is fused to the amino terminus of T7 RNAP, thereby conferring an independent binding capacity upon the RNAP (8Ostrander E.A. Benedetti P. Wang J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1261-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We found that recruitment of the Gal4:T7 RNAP protein to a ss promoter via a Gal4 binding site is not sufficient to activate transcription, but that transcription could be activated by the addition, in trans, of a ds hairpin loop that contained only the binding region. Strikingly, the same results were obtained with wild type (WT) enzyme, and in the absence of the Gal4 DNA binding site. Gel-shift experiments indicate that exposure of the RNAP to the isolated promoter binding region facilitates recruitment of the ss template and that the binding region is displaced prior to initiation. His-tagged wild type T7 RNAP was purified as described previously (9He B. Rong M. Lyakhov D.L. Gartenstein H. Diaz G.A. Castagna R.C. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K.

Gels were dried and analyzed by PhosphorImagerTM screen analysis (Amersham Biosciences). The Gal4:T7 RNAP fusion protein binds to the Gal4 site with an affinity that is greater than that of T7 RNAP for its promoter, yet it retains catalytic activity and is able to initiate transcription specifically at a T7 promoter (2Ujvari A. Martin C.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Ostrander E.A. Benedetti P. Wang J.C.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3773-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To recruit the fusion protein to a ss promoter template, we tethered a ds Gal4 recognition site to the template via a 5′ “tail” that is complementary to a region located 43 nt upstream from the promoter (Fig. 1, A and C,template b). Gel-shift experiments demonstrate assembly of the composite template and binding by Gal4:T7 RNAP (Fig. 1 B). At the same time, we examined a similar construct in which the upstream binding region of the T7 promoter was tethered to the template in the same manner (Fig. 1, A and C,template c). As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, recruitment of the RNAP to the ss template via the Gal4 binding motif (template b) was not sufficient to activate transcription. In contrast, the presence of a ds promoter binding region tethered upstream (template c) resulted in efficient transcription, giving rise to a spectrum of products that was nearly identical to that observed from a control template in which the target promoter was rendered double-stranded by annealing of the complementary NT strand (template d). A potential explanation for our failure to observe efficient transcription from the ss template using the Gal4 binding site is that the geometry of the Gal4 site relative to the initiation region of the promoter is not appropriate and prevents correct placement of the initiation region into the active site. This explanation is diminished, however, by the finding that the Gal4 binding site did not interfere with initiation by the fusion protein when the promoter was rendered double-stranded by annealing of a complementary NT strand (template e). The presence of an additional promoter binding region upstream of the ds promoter also had little effect on initiation at the ds promoter (template f). The observation that the tethered promoter binding region activated transcription from the ss promoter, whereas the tethered Gal4 binding site did not, suggests that the promoter binding region provides other functions in addition to its ability to recruit the RNAP to a nearby initiation site. To examine this, we asked whether the addition of the isolated promoter binding region in trans (as an untethered ds hairpin loop) could activate transcription by an RNAP that was bound to the ss template via the Gal4 binding site (Fig. 2). Two stem-loop structures were employed in these studies. RC12 contains the upstream binding region of the T7 promoter from −5 to −23; RC13 has a similar stability and structure but involves a sequence that is unrelated to the T7 promoter. Strikingly, addition of the isolated binding region to the tethered Gal4:T7 RNAP activated transcription from the ss template (Fig. 2,lane 2 versus lane 4). Even more striking, however, were the observations that stimulation also occurred with the WT enzyme (lane 1 versus lane 3) and in the absence of the Gal4 binding site (template b, lanes 7 and 8). The addition of RC13 (the control stem loop structure) did not lead to activation (lanes 9 and 10) nor did the addition of another stem-loop structure that deviates from the consensus binding site only at position −8 (which prevents promoter function (13Diaz G.A. Raskin C.A. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Klement J.F. Moorefield M.B. Jorgensen E.D. Brown J.E. Risman S. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)) (data not shown). In the templates described above, the target promoter in the ss template contained the entire consensus sequence from −17 to +6. To explore what features of the target promoter are required to allow activation (e.g. is the presence of the binding region required, or is the presence of a ss initiation region sufficient?), we constructed templates in which various portions of the binding region in the target promoter were deleted or replaced (Fig. 3). Truncation of the original template (MJ1) to 24 nt upstream from the start site (AK18) did not prevent activation by RC12 nor did substitution with a different sequence upstream of −17 (AK24). However, commencing at −15, substitution of the binding region with an unrelated sequence prevented activation. While necessary, the binding region is not sufficient, as additional flanking sequences upstream are also required (compare templates c and f). The affinity of T7 RNAP for a promoter that lacks a ds binding region is very low (Refs. 2Ujvari A. Martin C.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 3Maslak M. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4281-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, and 5Cheetham G. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholarand see Fig. 5). Activation of the RNAP to transcribe such a template must therefore result (at least in part) from an increased ability to bind to and/or retain the template. A possible explanation for the observations reported here is that exposure of the RNAP to the isolated binding region reorganizes the enzyme, allowing binding of the ss template and its entry into the active site. While in principle this could involve only transient exposure of the RNAP to the binding region, the affinity of the polymerase for the isolated ds binding region is even greater than that of the enzyme for a complete promoter (2Ujvari A. Martin C.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16Villemain J. Guajardo R. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 958-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Diaz G.A. Rong M. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10837-10843Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting that once formed, the binary complex may be quite stable. For these reasons, and for reasons that will be explained below, we suggest that binding of RC12 results in the formation of a binary complex that subsequently binds the single-stranded template. Three alternative pathways that could account for continued retention of the ss template and activation of transcription are presented in Fig. 4. First, formation of a stable ternary complex (consisting of RNAP, RC12, and the ss template) might be sufficient to allow initiation through cooperative interactions between the binding and initiation regions. However, this does not appear to be consistent with the observation that the ss template must also contain the sequence of the upstream binding region for activation to occur (see Fig. 3). Alternatively, the binding region present in RC12 may be denatured within the complex. Annealing of the T strand portion of the binding region to its complement in the ss template would then result in the formation of a ds binding region in the target promoter (i.e. a pss promoter; annealing model). In a third alternative, the ss template might displace the ds binding region, allowing it to interact with both the promoter binding region of the RNAP and with the active site (displacement model). The latter complex might mimic some of the features of an elongation complex in which promoter clearance has occurred. The 23-bp ds stem portion of RC12 is expected to be quite stable (predicted ΔG = −34.6 kcal/mol) and to rapidly self-anneal even if transiently denatured. Heating and annealing of RC12 to the ss target sequence in solution did not result in significant hybridization of the binding region to the ss template, even when the template was present at a 10-fold molar excess (data not shown). We therefore conclude that spontaneous annealing of RC12 to MJ1 cannot account for the observed activation. (However, on the basis of this experiment alone we cannot rule out the possibility that the polymerase might facilitate separation and annealing of the strands of RC12 within the ternary complex.) To investigate the alternative pathways shown in Fig. 4 more directly, we used a gel-shift assay to examine binding of RC12 and the ss template (Fig. 5). All three of the models predict that RC12 will enhance binding and retention of the ss template. As expected, adding increasing amounts of RC12 to reactions that contained a fixed concentration of RNAP and labeled ss template resulted in enhanced binding of the ss template (Fig. 5, Aand B). While the annealing model and the cooperative interaction model predict that adding increasing amounts of the ss template to complexes that have bound RC12 should not result in displacement of the ds binding region (and might even enhance its retention in the case of the annealing model), the displacement model predicts that addition of increasing amounts of the ss template should result in loss of the ds binding region from the complexes. As shown in Fig. 5, C andD, the latter result is observed. Here, binding of RC12 was observed in the absence of the ss template, but as the concentration of the ss template was increased, RC12 was displaced. Moreover, the transcription activity of the complexes increased with MJ1 concentration and remained at a high level even when nearly complete displacement of RC12 was observed. These observations are in direct contradiction of the annealing and cooperative interaction models, but are in agreement with the displacement model. In this work, we have shown that recruitment of T7 RNAP to a ss template that contains the consensus promoter sequence is not sufficient to permit initiation of transcription. Strikingly, the presence of the ds binding region, either tethered to the ss template some distance away from the promoter or added in trans as a stem loop structure, activates the RNAP to initiate transcription on such a template. Gel-shift assays demonstrate that exposure of the RNAP to the isolated binding region enables the RNAP to bind to the ss template, but that the binding region is displaced prior to initiation. From these experiments, we conclude that while T7 RNAP is ordinarily unable to bind a ss promoter template, exposure of the RNAP to the ds binding region of the promoter alters the enzyme in such a way as to enable it to bind and initiate transcription on the ss template. The observation that the ss template must contain the upstream binding sequence to be activated (Fig. 3) indicates that the ss template mustreplace some of the contacts made by the ds binding region, not just displace them. Most of the base-specific contacts made between the RNAP and the binding region of the promoter involve the template strand (4Cheetham G. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A.

A. 1998; 95: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Perhaps these interactions are important in the displacement process or in activation. Why is the RNAP unable to bind to the ss template unless it is first exposed to the binding region? Some insight into this question may come from studies with bacterial RNAPs, which also have promoters with a bipartite structure comprising an upstream binding region and a downstream initiation region. The transition to an open complex involves multiple stages, in which promoter bound as duplex DNA (a closed complex) is locally melted, and the T strand is led down into the active site (to form an open complex). Recent structural analyses indicate that in the open complex the T strand of the initiation region is enclosed in a channel that is surrounded on all sides by protein and that movement of region 1.1 of the transcription initiation factor ς is required to permit entry of the T strand and of downstream DNA into their respective binding sites (20Mekler V. Kortkhonjia E. Mukhopadhyay J. Knight J. Revyakin A. Kapanidis A.N. Niu W. Ebright Y.W. Levy R. Ebright R.H.

In view of the observations reported here, it would be of interest to determine whether exposure of the multisubunit RNAPs to the isolated binding regions of their promoter might induce conformational changes that are associated with open promoter formation. The formation of an open complex by T7 RNAP also involves multiple steps. The initial closed complex (EDC) isomerizes to an intermediate form (EDO1) in which the promoter is melted from −4 to −1 and subsequently to a fully open complex (EDO2) that is melted to +2 (23Bandwar R.P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14075-14082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies indicate that the enzyme may exist in two conformations, which differ in their rates of promoter binding and open promoter formation, with the fast form predominating in most RNAP preparations (24Jia Y. Kumar A. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30451-30458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It has not yet been determined whether exposure of the enzyme preparation to the isolated binding region alters the distribution of these two forms. Based upon these observations, we suggest that unliganded T7 RNAP is unable to bind to and/or insert the T strand in the initiation region into the active site and that coordinated changes in the structure and organization of the transcription complex in response to base-specific contacts in the binding region are required to capture the T strand or otherwise stabilize the open conformation. A number of structural elements in T7 RNAP are known to be involved in promoter binding and melting. The specificity loop (amino acid residues 740–769) interacts in a sequence-specific manner with bps in the binding region from −11 to −7 (4Cheetham G. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 13Diaz G.A. Raskin C.A. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Klement J.F.

Biol. 1992; 228: 506-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, an AT-rich recognition loop (residues 93–101) interacts with the promoter 13–17 nt upstream from the start, and a β-hairpin intercalating loop (residues 245–250) interacts with the promoter between −5 and −4 and is thought to be important for promoter melting and directing the T strand into the active site) (4Cheetham G. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 5Cheetham G. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Whereas the positions of the AT-rich recognition loop and the specificity loop remain largely unchanged before and after promoter binding and during the early stages of initiation, the β-hairpin intercalating loop is disordered and becomes visible in the crystal structure only after promoter binding (4Cheetham G. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 26Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A.

Speculating that the unformed β-hairpin loop might occlude the binding site or otherwise inhibit insertion of the T strand, we examined whether mutant RNAPs in which this element had been disrupted might be able to initiate transcription from a ss template. Neither of the mutant RNAPs that we tested (DelbH, in which residues 236–240 are deleted (28Stano N.M. Patel S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1009-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), or Δ231–241, in which residues 231–241 are deleted (29Brieba L.G. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3882-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)) provided this effect (data not shown); perhaps more substantial changes in this region are required. Other regions of the RNAP whose organization changes after promoter binding include the tip of the thumb domain, and a portion of the fingers domain, which forms part of the downstream DNA binding site in the elongation complex (4Cheetham G. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 26Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A.

Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 420: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We have not tested the effects of mutations in the latter regions. The templates used in the experiments described here extend only 10 nt downstream from the start site for transcription. While useful for studies of transcript initiation, the lengths of these templates are not sufficient to allow isomerization to a stable elongation complex (which is not complete until the transcription complexes have extended 10–14 nt downstream). In earlier studies, we had determined that the presence of the NT strand in the initiation region is important to isomerization and that transcription on promoters that lack the NT strand downstream of −4 (pss promoters) results in enhanced release of products in this size range (7Jiang M. Rong M. Martin C.T. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 310: 509-522Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 31Imburgio D. Anikin M. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To examine transcription from ss templates in more detail, we utilized templates that extend 20 nt downstream and found that the pattern of transcription was nearly identical to that of the pss promoters (data not shown).
