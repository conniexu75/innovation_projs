https://openalex.org/W4206930562,"One of the main forthcoming challenges of healthcare systems against preparedness and management of the pandemic is the challenge of procurement and recruitment of the human resources. This study is aimed to explore the health human resources challenges during COVID-19 pandemic in Iran.This qualitative content analysis study was conducted in 2020. The study population includes all the Iranian human resources managers affiliated in Universities of Medical Sciences, hospitals and health centers managers and the health networks managers all over the country. 23 participants were included via purposeful sampling considering the inclusion criteria and were interviewed individually. After 23 semi-structured interviews, data were saturated. Then the data were analyzed through content analysis approach applying MAXQDA10.Three main themes of ""organizational challenges"", ""legal challenges"", and ""personal challenges"" were explored as the main challenges of health human resources management during COVID-19. On the one hand, organizational challenges include restricted financial resources, compensation discrimination, staffing distinction points, imbalance in the workload, weak organizational coordination, inefficient inter-sectoral relationships, parallel decisions, inefficient distribution of the human resources, lack of applied education, lack of integrated health protocols, lack of appropriate evaluation of performance, employee turnover, lack of clear approaches for staffing, and shortage of specialized manpower, and on the other hand, the personal challenges include insufficient knowledge of the employees, psychological disorders, reduction of self-confidence, burnout, workload increase, reduced level of job satisfaction, effects of colleague and patients bereavement and unsafety sense against the work place. Finally, the legal challenges that mostly related to the governments laws and regulations include lack of protocols for continuous supportive services, inappropriate approaches and instructions for teleworking, and lack of alternative plans and regulations for the human resources.Organizational, legal and personal challenges are among three main challenges of health human resources management during COVID-19 pandemic. Serious attention to these challenges should be considered by health policymakers in order to be prepared for facing new probable outbreaks and managing the present condition. The integrated comprehensive planning of human resources management for COVID-19 along with supportive packages for the personnel can be helpful."

Therefore, the study on segmentation of retinal vessels images is of great significance for the diagnosis of visually threatening diseases. In recent years, especially the convolutional neural networks (CNN) based on UNet and its variant have been widely used in various medical image tasks. However, although CNN has achieved excellent performance, it cannot learn global and long-distance semantic information interaction well due to the local computing characteristics of convolution operation, which limits the development of medical image segmentation tasks. Transformer, currently popular in computer vision, has global computing features, but due to the lack of low-level details, local feature information extraction is insufficient. In this paper, we propose Patches Convolution Attention based Transformer UNet (PCAT-UNet), which is a U-shaped network based on Transformer with a Convolution branch. We use skip connection to fuse the deep and shallow features of both sides. By taking advantage of the complementary advantages of both sides, we can effectively capture the global dependence relationship and the details of the underlying feature space, thus improving the current problems of insufficient extraction of retinal micro vessels feature information and low sensitivity caused by easily predicting of pixels as background. In addition, our method enables end-to-end training and rapid inference. Finally, three publicly available retinal vessels datasets (DRIVE, STARE and CHASE_DB1) were used to evaluate PCAT-UNet. The experimental results show that the proposed PCAT-UNET method achieves good retinal vessel segmentation performance on these three datasets, and is superior to other architectures in terms of AUC, Accuracy and Sensitivity performance indicators. AUC reached 0.9872, 0.9953 and 0.9925, Accuracy reached 0.9622, 0.9796 and 0.9812, Sensitivity reached 0.8576, 0.8703 and 0.8493, respectively. In addition, PCAT-UNET also achieved good results in two other F1-Score and Specificity indicators."
https://openalex.org/W4206907309,"COVID-19 greatly challenges the human health sector, and has resulted in a large amount of medical waste that poses various potential threats to the environment. In this study, we compiled relevant data released by official agencies and the media, and conducted data supplementation based on earlier studies to calculate the net value of medical waste produced in the Hubei Province due to COVID-19 with the help of a neural network model. Next, we reviewed the data related to the environmental impact of medical waste per unit and designed four scenarios to estimate the environmental impact of new medical waste generated during the pandemic. The results showed that a medical waste generation rate of 0.5 kg/bed/day due to COVID-19 resulted in a net increase of medical waste volume by about 3366.99 tons in the Hubei Province. In the four scenario assumptions, i.e., if the medical waste resulting from COVID-19 is completely incinerated, it will have a large impact on the air quality. If it is disposed by distillation sterilization, it will produce a large amount of wastewater and waste residue. Based on the results of the study, we propose three policy recommendations: strict control of medical wastewater discharge, reduction and transformation of the emitted acidic gases, and attention to the emission of metallic nickel in exhaust gas and chloride in soil. These policy recommendations provide a scientific basis for controlling medical waste pollution."
https://openalex.org/W4206946623,"Recent reports indicate that COVID-19 pandemic has significant influence on medical professionals' mental health. Strict limitations in clinical practice and social interactions within academic community, which had to be introduced, could lead to significant psychological distress in medical students. The aim of the study was to assess resilience, well-being and burnout among Polish medical students in the COVID-19 era.The online survey consisting of validated questionnaires assessing resilience (Resilience Scale 14; RS-14), well-being (Medical Student Well-Being Index) and burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory) as well as self-created survey concerning mental health problems, use of stimulants, SARS-CoV-2 infection, work in COVID-19 units, medical education and social attitude towards health care professionals in the pandemic era was distributed via Facebook and other online students' platforms. 1858 MSs from all polish medical schools agreed to fill in the survey.'Very low', 'low' and 'on the low end' levels of resilience were found in 26%, 19.1% and 26.9% of the study group, respectively. Students with higher resilience level presented better attitude towards online and hybrid classes. 16.8% of respondents stated that they worked, currently work or plan to work voluntarily at the pandemic frontline. In terms of burnout, these respondents presented lower exhaustion (p = 0.003) and cynicism (p = 0.02), and higher academic efficacy (p = 0.002). That group also showed greater resilience (p = 0.046). The SARS-CoV-2 infection among respondents, their relatives and friends did not influence the results. 39.1% of respondents declared the need of the psychological or psychiatric consultation in relation to pandemic challenges. 231 (26.4%) participants previously diagnosed with mental health disorders noticed worsening of their symptoms. Increased intake of alcohol, cigarettes or other stimulants was noticed by 340 (28.6%) respondents. 80.2% of respondents thought that social aversion and mistrust towards doctors increased during the pandemic and part of them claimed it affected their enthusiasm toward medical career.The majority of medical students presented low levels of resilience and high burnout at the time of pandemic. Providing necessary support especially in terms of mental health and building up the resilience of this vulnerable group seems crucial to minimize harm of current pandemic and similar future challenges."
https://openalex.org/W4206901185,"Zingiber ottensii, is widely used in Asian traditional remedies for the treatment of many diseases. The present study explores anticancer activity of Z. ottensii essential oil (ZOEO) and its nanoformulations. ZOEO obtained from hydrodistillation of Z. ottensii fresh rhizomes was analysis using gas chromatography mass spectroscopy. Zerumbone (25.21%) was the major compound of ZOEO followed by sabinene (23.35%) and terpene-4-ol (15.97%). Four types of ZOEO loaded nanoformulations; nanoemulsion, microemulsion, nanoemulgels, and microemulgel, were developed. The average droplet size of the nanoemulsion and microemulsion was significantly smaller than that of the nanoemulgel and microemulgel. Comparison with other essential oils of plants of the same family on anticancer activity against A549, MCF-7, HeLa, and K562, ZOEO showed the highest cytotoxicity with IC50 of 43.37±6.69, 9.77±1.61, 23.25±7.73, and 60.49±9.41 μg/mL, respectively. Investigation using flow cytometry showed that ZOEO significantly increased the sub-G1 populations (cell death) in cell cycle analysis and induced cell apoptosis by apoptotic analysis. The developed nanoformulations significantly enhanced cytotoxicity of ZOEO, particularly against MCF-7 with the IC50 of 3.08±2.58, 0.74±0.45, 2.31±0.91, and 6.45±5.84 μg/mL, respectively. Among the four nanoformulations developed in the present study, nanoemulsion and microemulsion were superior to nanoemulgel and microemulgel in delivering ZOEO into cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W4207008464,"As of February 2021 COVID-19 report in 57 African countries, there were 3,761,512 confirmed cases and 98,088 deaths. Ethiopia reported the highest number of cases in East Africa with a total of 147,092 cases and 2,194 deaths. Over 1.5 billion students from 195 countries across the world separated from school as a consequence of the closure of schools related to the pandemic. This study aimed to determine the level of knowledge, attitude, prevention practices, and determinant factors regarding COVID-19 among preparatory school students in southwest Ethiopia.An institution-based cross-sectional study design was used for 422 samples. Each respondent was selected using simple random sampling. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. The collected data were entered and analyzed using Statistical Package for social science software version 25.0. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to identify factors that were significantly associated with the practice of COVID-19 prevention.The response rate in this study was 96.2%. A higher proportion of the respondents were female (53.9%), Bench (43.6%), and protestant (47.3%). The level of good knowledge, positive attitude, and good practice were 81.8%, 70.9%, and 47.0% respectively. Using social media [AOR: 1.801, 95% CI: 1.005, 3.226], watching television [AOR: 1.884 95% CI: 1.093, 3.247], being knowledgeable [AOR: 5.173 95% CI: 2.276, 11.755], and having a positive attitude [AOR: 4.300 95% CI: 2.351, 7.868] were positively associated with COVID-19 prevention practice.Despite the high level of knowledge and a moderate level of positive attitude, the practice of COVID-19 prevention measures was low. Using social media, watching television, being knowledgeable, and having positive attitudes towards COVID-19 increases the tendency to practice COVID-19 prevention measures. School directors and teachers should strictly monitor students for their adherence to COVID-19 prevention measures as directed by the local and national health care departments."
https://openalex.org/W4206988916,"Diabetes is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a chronic neurodegenerative disease. We and others have shown prediabetes, including hyperglycemia and obesity induced by high fat and high sucrose diets, is associated with exacerbated amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation and cognitive impairment in AD transgenic mice. However, whether hyperglycemia reduce glial clearance of oligomeric amyloid-β (oAβ), the most neurotoxic Aβ aggregate, remains unclear. Mixed glial cultures simulating the coexistence of astrocytes and microglia in the neural microenvironment were established to investigate glial clearance of oAβ under normoglycemia and chronic hyperglycemia. Ramified microglia and low IL-1β release were observed in mixed glia cultures. In contrast, amoeboid-like microglia and higher IL-1β release were observed in primary microglia cultures. APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice are a commonly used AD mouse model. Microglia close to senile plaques in APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice exposed to normoglycemia or chronic hyperglycemia exhibited an amoeboid-like morphology; other microglia were ramified. Therefore, mixed glia cultures reproduce the in vivo ramified microglial morphology. To investigate the impact of sustained high-glucose conditions on glial oAβ clearance, mixed glia were cultured in media containing 5.5 mM glucose (normal glucose, NG) or 25 mM glucose (high glucose, HG) for 16 days. Compared to NG, HG reduced the steady-state level of oAβ puncta internalized by microglia and astrocytes and decreased oAβ degradation kinetics. Furthermore, the lysosomal acidification and lysosomal hydrolysis activity of microglia and astrocytes were lower in HG with and without oAβ treatment than NG. Moreover, HG reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels in mixed glia, which can lead to reduced lysosomal function. Overall, continuous high glucose reduces microglial and astrocytic ATP production and lysosome activity which may lead to decreased glial oAβ degradation. Our study reveals diabetes-induced hyperglycemia hinders glial oAβ clearance and contributes to oAβ accumulation in AD pathogenesis."

The study recruited 5,628 prospective consecutive patients who were hospitalized in South Korea with COVID-19 infection, and enrolled in the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) dataset between January 20, 2020, and April 30, 2020. The primary endpoint was in-hospital death from COVID-19. The cohort comprised of 3,308 women (59%) and 2,320 men (41%). In-hospital death was significantly lower in women than men (3.5% vs. 5.5%, hazard ratio (HR): 0.61; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.47 to 0.79, p <0.001). Results were consistent after multivariable regression (HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.85, p = 0.023) and propensity score matching (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.86, p = 0.012). In South Korea, women had a significantly lower risk of in-hospital death amongst those patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection."
https://openalex.org/W4206953797,"Otitis media (OM) and externa (OE) are painful, recurrent ear conditions. As most otitis publications focus on the bacterial content of childhood ears, there remains a dearth of information regarding the adult ear microbiome including both bacteria and fungi. This study compares the outer ear microbiome of healthy adults to adults affected by OE and OM using both intergenic-transcribed-spacer (ITS) and 16S-rDNA sequencing. The adult ear core microbiome consists of the prokaryote Cutibacterium acnes and the eukaryotic Malassezia arunalokei, M. globosa, and M. restricta. The healthy ear mycobiome is dominated by Malassezia and can be divided into two groups, one dominated by M. arunalokei, the other by M. restricta. Microbiome diversity and biomass varied significantly between healthy and diseased ears, and analyses reveal the presence of a potential mutualistic, protective effect of Malassezia species and C. acnes. The healthy ear core microbiome includes the bacteria Staphylococcus capitis and S. capitis/caprae, while the diseased ear core is composed of known bacterial and fungal pathogens including Aspergillus sp., Candida sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, and Corynebacterium jeikeium. The data presented highlight the need for early detection of the cause of otitis to direct more appropriate, efficient treatments. This will improve patient outcomes and promote improved antimicrobial stewardship."
https://openalex.org/W4206981954,"In the mining process of working face, the additional stress generated by the fault changes the law of roadway deformation and failure as well as the law of overburden failure. Aiming at the influence of the fault in the mining process of working face, this study introduced the geological strength index (GSI) to analyze the stress distribution in the elastic-plastic zone of the surrounding rock of the roadway. And similar experiments under different engineering backgrounds were combined to study the characteristics of overburden movement and stress evolution. Based on the conclusions obtained, the roadway support scheme was designed. This study shows that, compared with ordinary mining, through-the-fault mining causes slippage and dislocation of the fault, the load of the overburden is transferred to both sides of the fault, and the stress near the fault accumulates abnormally. The “three zones” characteristics of the overburden movement disappear, the subsidence pattern is changed from ""trapezoid"" to ""inverted triangle"", and the influence distance of the advanced mining stress on the working face is extended from 20m to 30m. The instability range of roadway surrounding rock is exponentially correlated with the rupture degree of the surrounding rock. Through the introduction of GSI, the critical instability range of roadway surrounding rock is deduced to be 2.32m. According to the conclusion, the bolt length and roadway reinforced support length are redesigned. Engineering application shows that the deformation rate of the roadway within 60 days is controlled below 0.1 ~ 0.5mm/d, the deformation amount is controlled within 150mm, and the roadway deformation is controlled, which generally meets the requirements of use. The research results provide guidance and reference for similar roadway support."
https://openalex.org/W4207070926,"The SafeBoosC II, randomised clinical trial, showed that the burden of cerebral hypoxia was reduced with the combination of near infrared spectroscopy and a treatment guideline in extremely preterm infants during the first 72 hours after birth. We have previously reported that a high burden of cerebral hypoxia was associated with cerebral haemorrhage and EEG suppression towards the end of the 72-hour intervention period, regardless of allocation. In this study we describe the associations between the burden of cerebral hypoxia and the 2-year outcome.Cerebral oxygenation was continuously monitored from 3 to 72 hours after birth in 166 extremely preterm infants. At 2 years of age 114 of 133 surviving children participated in the follow-up program: medical examination, Bayley II or III test and the parental Ages and Stages Questionnaire. The infants were classified according to the burden of hypoxia: within the first three quartiles (n = 86, low burden) or within in the 4th quartile (n = 28, high burden). All analyses were conducted post hoc.There were no statistically significant differences between the quantitative assessments of neurodevelopment in the groups of infants with the low burden of cerebral hypoxia versus the group of infants with the high burden of cerebral hypoxia. The infants in the high hypoxia burden group had a higher-though again not statistically significant-rate of cerebral palsy (OR 2.14 (0.33-13.78)) and severe developmental impairment (OR 4.74 (0.74-30.49).The burden of cerebral hypoxia was not significantly associated with impaired 2-year neurodevelopmental outcome in this post-hoc analysis of a feasibility trial."
https://openalex.org/W4207073265,"Salmonella is a common foodborne pathogen, especially in meat and meat products. Lytic phages are promising alternatives to conventional methods for Salmonella biocontrol in food and food processing. In this study, a virulent bacteriophage (PSDA-2) against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was isolated from the sewage and it was found that PSDA-2 belongs to Cornellvirus genus of Siphoviridae family by morphological and phylogenetic analysis. Based on the one-step growth curve, PSDA-2 has a short latent period (10 min) and a high burst size (120 PFU/cell). The stability test in vitro reveals that PSDA-2 is stable at 30-70°C and pH 3-10. Bioinformatics analysis show that PSDA-2 genome consists of 40,062 bp with a GC content of 50.21% and encodes 63 open reading frames (ORFs); no tRNA genes, lysogenic genes, drug resistance genes and virulence genes were identified in the genome. Moreover, the capacity for PSDA-2 to control Salmonella Typhimurium in chilled mutton was investigated. The results show that incubation of PSDA-2 at 4°C reduced recoverable Salmonella by 1.7 log CFU/mL and 2.1 log CFU/mL at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 and 10,000 respectively, as relative to the phage-excluded control. The features of phage PSDA-2 suggest that it has the potential to be an agent to control Salmonella."
https://openalex.org/W4206935588,"In the process of intelligent system operation fault diagnosis and decision making, the multi-source, heterogeneous, complex, and fuzzy characteristics of information make the conflict, uncertainty, and validity problems appear in the process of information fusion, which has not been solved. In this study, we analyze the credibility and variation of conflict among evidence from the perspective of conflict credibility weight and propose an improved model of multi-source information fusion based on Dempster-Shafer theory (DST). From the perspectives of the weighting strategy and Euclidean distance strategy, we process the basic probability assignment (BPA) of evidence and assign the credible weight of conflict between evidence to achieve the extraction of credible conflicts and the adoption of credible conflicts in the process of evidence fusion. The improved algorithm weakens the problem of uncertainty and ambiguity caused by conflicts in the information fusion process, and reduces the impact of information complexity on analysis results. And it carries a practical application out with the fault diagnosis of wind turbine system to analyze the operation status of wind turbines in a wind farm to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The result shows that under the conditions of improved distance metric evidence discrepancy and credible conflict quantification, the algorithm better shows the conflict and correlation among the evidence. It improves the accuracy of system operation reliability analysis, improves the utilization rate of wind energy resources, and has practical implication value."
https://openalex.org/W4206908401,"Insight into the metabolic biosignature of tuberculosis (TB) may inform clinical care, reduce adverse effects, and facilitate metabolism-informed therapeutic development. However, studies often yield inconsistent findings regarding the metabolic profiles of TB. Herein, we conducted an untargeted metabolomics study using plasma from 63 Korean TB patients and 50 controls. Metabolic features were integrated with the data of another cohort from China (35 TB patients and 35 controls) for a global functional meta-analysis. Specifically, all features were matched to a known biological network to identify potential endogenous metabolites. Next, a pathway-level gene set enrichment analysis-based analysis was conducted for each study and the resulting p-values from the pathways of two studies were combined. The meta-analysis revealed both known metabolic alterations and novel processes. For instance, retinol metabolism and cholecalciferol metabolism, which are associated with TB risk and outcome, were altered in plasma from TB patients; proinflammatory lipid mediators were significantly enriched. Furthermore, metabolic processes linked to the innate immune responses and possible interactions between the host and the bacillus showed altered signals. In conclusion, our proof-of-concept study indicated that a pathway-level meta-analysis directly from metabolic features enables accurate interpretation of TB molecular profiles."
https://openalex.org/W4206917099,"Out-of-pocket (OOP) payment is the major payment strategy for healthcare in Bangladesh, and the share of OOP expenditure has increased alarmingly. Dhaka is recognised as one of the fastest-growing megacities in the world. The objective of this study is to capture the self-reported illnesses among urban citizens and to identify whether and to what extent socioeconomic, demographic and behavioural factors of the population influence OOP healthcare expenditures.This study utilises cross-sectional survey data collected from May to August 2019 in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh. A total of 3,100 households were randomly selected. Simple descriptive statistics including frequencies, percentage, mean (95% CI), median and inter-quartile range were presented. Bivariate analysis and multivariate regression models were employed.We observed that acute illnesses (e.g., fever, flu/cough) were dominant among participants. Among the chronic illnesses, approximately 9.6% of people had diabetes, while 5.3% had high/low blood pressure. The richest quintile only spent 5.2% of their household income on healthcare, while the poorest households spent approximately six times more than the richest households. We noted that various factors such as marital status, religion, source of care, access to safe water, income quintile and even the location of households had a significant relationship with OOP expenditure.Our findings can serve as important source of data in terms of disease- specific symptoms and out-of-pocket cost among urban citizens in Dhaka. The people belonging to wealthier households tended to choose better healthcare facilities and spend more. A pro-poor policy initiative and even an urban health protection scheme may be necessary to ensure that healthcare services are accessible and affordable, in line with the Bangladesh National Urban Health Strategy."
https://openalex.org/W4207044216,"Background Cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are increasing at an alarming rate throughout the world, including Ethiopia. Food handlers in food and drink establishments are at high risk of exposure to the virus due to their many daily contacts with customers. Since there is a paucity of evidence about infection prevention practices and associated factors among this high-risk group in Ethiopia including in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town, this study was designed to address this gap. Method An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 422 food handlers in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town food and drink establishments in July and August 2020. The study participants were selected using a simple random sampling technique. Data were collected by trained data collectors using a pretested structured questionnaire and an on-the-spot observational checklist. Data were entered into EpiData version 4.6 and exported to STATA version 14.0 for data cleaning and analysis. Data were analyzed using bivariable and multivariable logistic regression model at 95% confidence interval (CI). From the bivariable analysis, variables with a p -value &lt;0.25 were retained into multivariable analysis. Finally, variables that had a p -value &lt;0.05 were declared as factors significantly associated with good infection prevention practices of COVID-19 among food handlers. Main findings The overall rate of good practice in infection prevention among food handlers was 43.9% (95% CI: 39.2–48.4%). Among the total 401 food handlers, 79.8% had good knowledge and 58.4% had a favorable attitude about COVID-19 infection prevention. Factors significantly associated with good COVID-19 infection prevention practices were: educational status of college or above (AOR = 1.97; 95% CI: 1.32–3.75), food handling work experience greater than five years (AOR = 2.55; 95% CI: 1.43–5.77), availability of written guidelines within the food and drink establishment (AOR = 2.68; 95% CI: 1.52–4.75), and taking training about infection prevention (AOR = 3.26; 95% CI: 1.61–6.61). Conclusion Our findings showed that around one-third of food handlers had good infection prevention practices. Thus, to reduce COVID-19 transmission, integrated work is urgently needed to further improve food handlers’ good practices, knowledge and attitude about infection prevention through providing health education, training and by making written infection prevention guidelines available in food and drink establishments."
https://openalex.org/W4206898920,"Some of community mitigation efforts on COVID-19 created challenges to ongoing public health programs, including HIV care and prevention services among men who have sex with men (MSM). The goal of the current study was to explore sociodemographic factors and the impact of COVID-19 on HIV testing among Chinese MSM during state-enforced quarantine.We conducted a community based survey between May 1st to June 30th, 2020 on COVID-19 related impacts on HIV testing among 436 China MSM during the COVID-19 state-enforced quarantine.One-third (33.7%) of MSM received HIV testing during the quarantine period. Few participants reported difficulty accessing facility-based testing (n = 13, 3.0%) or obtaining HIV self-test kit online (n = 22, 5.0%). However, 12.1% of participants reported being afraid of getting facility-based HIV test due to concerns about the risk of COVID-19. In the multivariate logistic regression model, participants who were married (aOR: 1.89, 95%CI: 1.19-3.01), reported increased quality of sleep (aOR: 2.07, 95%CI: 1.11-3.86), and increased difficulty in accessing health care (aOR: 2.34, 95%CI: 1.37-3.99) were more likely to get an HIV test during the state-enforced quarantine.The mitigation measures of COVID-19 have created various barriers to access HIV related prevention services in China, including HIV testing. To mitigate these impacts on HIV prevention and care services, future programs need to address barriers to HIV-related services, such as providing high-quality HIV self-testing. Meanwhile, psychological services or other social services are needed to those experiencing mental distress."
https://openalex.org/W4206946822,"Muscle Invasive bladder cancer is known to have an abundance of mutations, particularly in DNA damage response and chromatin modification genes. The role of these mutations in the development and progression of the disease is not well understood. However, a mutually exclusive mutation pattern between gene pairs could suggest gene mutations of significance. For example, a mutually exclusive mutation pattern could suggest an epistatic relationship where the outcome of a mutation in one gene would have the same outcome as a mutation in a different gene. The significance of a mutually exclusive relationship was determined by establishing a normal distribution of the conditional probabilities for having a mutation in one gene and not the other as well as the reverse relationship for each gene pairing. Then these distributions were used to determine the sigma-magnitude of standard deviation by which the observed value differed from the expected, a value that can also be interpreted as the 'p-value'. This approach led to the identification of mutually exclusive mutation patterns in KDM6A and KMT2D as well as KDM6A and RB1 that suggested the observed mutation pattern did not happen by chance. Upon further investigation of these genes and their interactions, a potential similar outcome was identified that supports the concept of epistasis. Knowledge of these mutational interactions provides a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying muscle invasive bladder cancer development, and may direct therapeutic development exploiting genotoxic chemotherapy and synthetic lethality in these pathways."
https://openalex.org/W4206996885,"We explored public perceptions about the COVID-19 pandemic to learn how those attitudes may affect compliance with health behaviors.Participants were Central Pennsylvania adults from diverse backgrounds purposively sampled (based on race, gender, educational attainment, and healthcare worker status) who responded to a mixed methods survey, completed between March 25-31, 2020. Four open-ended questions were analyzed, including: ""What worries you most about the COVID-19 pandemic?"" We applied a pragmatic, inductive coding process to conduct a qualitative, descriptive content analysis of responses.Of the 5,948 respondents, 538 were sampled for this qualitative analysis. Participants were 58% female, 56% with ≥ bachelor's degree, and 50% from minority racial backgrounds. Qualitative descriptive analysis revealed four themes related to respondents' health and societal concerns: lack of faith in others; fears of illness or death; frustration at perceived slow societal response; and a desire for transparency in communicating local COVID-19 information. An ""us-versus-them"" subtext emerged; participants attributed non-compliance with COVID-19 behaviors to other groups, setting themselves apart from those Others.Our study uncovered Othering undertones in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, occurring between groups of like-minded individuals with behavioral differences in 'compliance' versus 'non-compliance' with public health recommendations. Addressing the 'us-versus-them' mentality may be important for boosting compliance with recommended health behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W4207055231,"Microorganisms inhabiting the supraglacial ice are biotechnologically significant as they are equipped with unique adaptive features in response to extreme environmental conditions of high ultraviolet radiations and frequent freeze-thaw. In the current study, we obtained eleven strains of Pseudomonas from the East Rathong supraglacial site in Sikkim Himalaya that showed taxonomic ambiguity in terms of species affiliation. Being one of the most complex and diverse genera, deciphering the correct taxonomy of Pseudomonas species has always been challenging. So, we conducted multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) using five housekeeping genes, which concluded the taxonomic assignment of these strains to Pseudomonas antarctica. This was further supported by the lesser mean genetic distances with P. antarctica (0.73%) compared to P. fluorescens (3.65%), and highest ANI value of ~99 and dDDH value of 91.2 of the representative strains with P. antarctica PAMC 27494. We examined the multi-tolerance abilities of these eleven Pseudomonas strains. Indeed the studied strains displayed significant tolerance to freezing for 96 hours compared to the mesophilic control strain, while except for four strains, seven strains exhibited noteworthy tolerance to UV-C radiations. The genome-based findings revealed many cold and radiation resistance-associated genes that supported the physiological findings. Further, the bacterial strains produced two or more cold-active enzymes in plate-based assays. Owing to the polyadaptational attributes, the strains ERGC3:01 and ERGC3:05 could be most promising for bioprospection."
https://openalex.org/W4207064745,"Most incarcerations for people living with HIV (PLWH) occur in jails, yet studies of HIV care during jail incarceration are limited. As part of a larger study to explore the ethical considerations in extending public health HIV surveillance to jail settings, we conducted semi-structured interviews with twenty-three PLWH with more than 300 distinct jail incarcerations post HIV diagnosis in 21 unique North Carolina jails. Interviews included questions about HIV disclosure in jail, the type of HIV care received in jail, and overall experiences with HIV care in jail. We report on participants’ experiences and perspectives in four domains: access to HIV care in jail; impact of jail incarceration on continuity of HIV care; privacy and stigma; and satisfaction with HIV care in jail. Although most participants received HIV medications and saw providers while in jail, almost half reported that their greatest challenge in regard to HIV care was obtaining their HIV medications in the face of limited jail resources or policies that made access to medications difficult. Findings from this study suggest that jail leadership should review internal policies regarding HIV medications to ensure that PLWH can receive them quickly upon entry into jail. Findings also suggest that more external resources are needed, for example from state and local health departments, so that jails can provide timely HIV medications for PLWH incarcerated in their facilities."
https://openalex.org/W4207080416,"Generally, a loess high fill project will undergo a time-dependent deformation and settlement process for a long time after the initial fill. Understanding the creeping behaviour of compacted loess is an important part of determining the stability of a compacted loess foundation. To study the creep behaviour of remoulded loess under different levels of compactness, we performed triaxial shear and triaxial creep tests using Q 2 loess specimens obtained from the new district of Yan’an city. Based on laboratory test results, the triaxial shear and creep characteristics of remoulded loess under different levels compactness are summarised. The regularity of instantaneous strain, creep strain, total accumulated strain and initial shear modulus were analysed and the relationship between the compactness and long-term strength of remoulded loess is provided. It was found that the remoulded loess becomes harder and its long-term strength increases with an increase in compactness. Furthermore, we propose a new creep model (HD), based on the hardening-damage mechanism, and have derived one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) creep equations based on this new creep model. This new creep model is flexible enough to fit the typical creep test curves of remoulded loess, while perfectly describing the tertiary creep stage. Finally, the sensitivity of the HD creep model parameters was analysed; the results indicate that the parameters denoted as α , γ , and β significantly affect the morphological changes and various stage characteristics are represented by the creep curve."
https://openalex.org/W4213339416,"Long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are a proven tool to reduce malaria transmission, but in Africa efficacy is being reduced by pyrethroid resistance in the major vectors. A previous study that was conducted in Muleba district, Tanzania indicated possible involvement of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in a pyrethroid resistance in An. gambiae population where pre-exposure to piperonyl butoxide (PBO) followed by permethrin exposure in CDC bottle bioassays led to partial restoration of susceptibility. PBO is a synergist that can block pyrethroid-metabolizing enzymes in a mosquito. Insecticide resistance profiles and underlying mechanisms were investigated in Anopheles gambiae and An. funestus from Muleba during a cluster randomized trial. Diagnostic dose bioassays using permethrin, together with intensity assays, suggest pyrethroid resistance that is both strong and very common, but not extreme. Transcriptomic analysis found multiple P450 genes over expressed including CYP6M2, CYP6Z3, CYP6P3, CYP6P4, CYP6AA1 and CYP9K1 in An. gambiae and CYP6N1, CYP6M7, CYP6M1 and CYP6Z1 in An. funestus. Indeed, very similar suites of P450 enzymes commonly associated with resistant populations elsewhere in Africa were detected as over expressed suggesting a convergence of mechanisms across Sub-Saharan African malaria vectors. The findings give insight into factors that may correlate with pyrethroid PBO LLIN success, broadly supporting model predictions, but revision to guidelines previously issued by the World Health Organization is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4206931212,"To evaluate whether telomere length (TL), mitochondrial-DNA (mt-DNA) or epigenetic age estimators based on DNA methylation (DNAm) pattern could be considered reliable predictors of in-vitro-fertilization (IVF) success in terms of live birth rate.Prospective cohort study.Infertility Unit of the Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico.181 women aged 37-39 years who underwent IVF at a single-centre between January 2017 and December 2018.On the day of recruitment, blood samples were collected, and genomic DNA was isolated from white blood cells. TL, mt-DNA and DNAm assessment was performed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Biological age (DNAm age) was computed as the algorithm based on methylation pattern of five genes. Epigenetic age acceleration was estimated from the residuals of the linear model of epigenetic age regressed on chronological age. Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINE)-1 methylation pattern was used as a surrogate for global DNA methylation.This study investigated whether peripheral TL, mt-DNA and DNAm could predict live birth in IVF cycles.TL, mt-DNA and LINE-1 methylation were not associated with IVF success. Conversely, DNAm age resulted significantly lower in women who had a live birth compared to women who did not (36.1 ± 4.2 and 37.3 ± 3.3 years, respectively, p = 0.04). For DNAm age, odds ratio (OR) for live birth per year of age was 0.90 (95%CI: 0.82-0.99, p = 0.036) after adjusting for FSH and antral follicle count (AFC) and 0.90 (95%CI: 0.82-0.99, p = 0.028) after adjusting also for number of oocytes retrieved. A significant association also emerged for epigenetic age acceleration after adjustments (OR = 0.91, 95%CI: 0.83-1.00, p = 0.048).DNAm age is associated with IVF success but the magnitude of this association is insufficient to claim a clinical use. However, our findings are promising and warrant further investigation. Assessment of biological age using different epigenetic clocks or focusing on different tissues may reveal new predictors of IVF success."
https://openalex.org/W4206947671,"The scientific evaluation of tourism resources provides the basic conditions for the rational development and utilization of tourism resources, which is significant for the sustainable development of tourism. On the basis of obtaining a large sample of tourism resource data, this study constructed an evaluation index system of regional tourism resources from four aspects: quantity, type, grade, and a combination of regional tourism resources, taking the township scale as the spatial evaluation unit. The combination weighting method was used to evaluate the grade of tourism resources in each township, and the hierarchical clustering method and spatial autocorrelation method were used to analyze the spatial patterns of the tourism resource values. On the basis of the evaluation’s results and spatial pattern analysis, this paper analyzed the influencing factors of tourism resource patterns and puts forward a tourism development model suitable for Hainan tourism development. The results showed that the overall value of tourism resources on Hainan Island was low, and the spatial pattern was obviously different, showing that the northern piedmont plain area was higher than the southern hilly area, and the east coast area was higher than the west coast area. Based on the analysis of quantity density, type abundance, grade advantage, and spatial combination, the tourism resource values of Hainan Island was divided into four combination areas: the first area was diversity and good combination, the second area was large quantity and good combination, the third area was diversity and high-quality resources, and the fourth area was large quantity. In addition, from the analysis of the spatial agglomeration effect, the phenomena of high and low agglomerations of tourism resource values were obvious. Finally, this paper puts forward a tourism development model for Hainan Island by grading, classification, and zoning. The results of this study can determine the time sequence and mode of regional tourism resources development and provide spatial implications and suggestions for regional tourism planning and management."

Design Randomized Clinical Trial. Setting Rehabilitation Hospital. Participants Patients within sub-acute phase (3–24 months) of SCI. Interventions We investigated if high-intensity exercise training via the addition of functional electrically stimulated (FES) leg muscles, provides sufficient stimulus to mitigate against body composition changes in the sub-acute phase after SCI. Main outcome measures We explored potential effects of FES row training (FESRT) on body fat gain, lean mass loss, and cardiometabolic parameters and compared the effects of 6-month of FESRT (n = 18) to standard of care (SOC, n = 13). Those in SOC were crossed over to FESRT. Results FESRT resulted in greater exercise capacity and a tendency for lesser total body fat accumulation with a significant increase in total and leg lean mass (p&lt;0.05). In addition pelvis and total bone mineral density declines were significantly less (p&lt;0.05). Compared to SOC, FESRT did not lead to any significant difference in insulin sensitivity or serum lipids. However, HbA1C levels were significantly decreased in SOC participants who crossed over to 6-month FESRT. Conclusion FESRT early after SCI provides a sufficient stimulus to mitigate against detrimental body composition changes. This may lead to prevention of losses in lean mass, including bone."
https://openalex.org/W4207067693,"Paint technology, namely paint preparation and application procedures, is an important aspect of painting traditions. With the expansion of archaeometric studies and in situ non-destructive analytical methods, a renewal of technological studies is being observed in rock art. In situ analyses have several limitations that are widely discussed in the literature, however. It is not yet clear whether they provide accurate information on paint technology, except under certain conditions. Here, we evaluated digital microscopic and pXRF in situ analyses for the characterisation of a large set of red and yellow paintings from the El Castillo cave, Cantabria, Spain. We have set experiments and used statistical methods to identify differences between paint components and determine factors impacting pXRF measurements. We found that the compositional heterogeneity of the paintings’ environment, especially variations in secondary deposits, was responsible for most of the differences observed between the pXRF signals recorded on the paintings. We concluded that the El Castillo cave environment is not suitable for non-destructive technological studies, but that more favourable contexts might exist. Following previous works and our own results, we advocate a combination of both in situ and laboratory invasive analyses for the study of paint composition and paint technology. Our research protocol, based on the comparison of rock paintings, their substrate, experimental paintings and Fe-normalisation of the signals can improve the reliability of pXRF results. We also propose to include more systematic characterisation of rock wall heterogeneity and the use of microscopic analyses in non-destructive approaches."
https://openalex.org/W4206899995,"The COVID-19 outbreak has generated significant uncertainty about the future, especially for young adults. Health and economic threats, as well as more diffuse concerns about the consequences of COVID-19, can trigger feelings of anxiety, leading individuals to adopt uncertainty-reducing behaviours. We tested whether anxiety was associated with an increase in willingness to be exposed to the risk of COVID-19 infection (WiRE) using an online survey administered to 3,110 French individuals aged between 18 and 35 years old during the first pandemic wave and lockdown period (April 2020). Overall, 56.5% of the sample declared a positive WiRE. A one standard deviation increase in psychological state anxiety raised the WiRE by +3.9 pp (95% CI [+1.6, 6.2]). Unemployment was associated with a higher WiRE (+8.2 percentage points (pp); 95% CI [+0.9, 15.4]). One standard deviation increases in perceived hospitalisation risk and in income (+1160€) were associated with a -4.1 pp (95% CI [-6.2, 2.1]) decrease in the WiRE and +2.7 pp increase (95% CI [+1.1, 4.4]), respectively. Overall, our results suggest that both psychological anxiety and the prospect of economic losses can undermine young adults' adherence to physical distancing recommendations. Public policies targeting young adults must consider both their economic situation and their mental health, and they must use uncertainty-reducing communication strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4206955777,"In the last four decades, the problem of income inequality has gradually become one of the most serious social problems in China at both the regional and individual levels. Recently, the central government announced that the main social contradiction is that between people’s growing need for a better life and unbalanced and insufficient economic development. In this study, we analyse the effects of income distribution on individuals’ health using a series of indicators of income distribution and different measures of individuals’ health status. By utilizing data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) from 1989 to 2015, our empirical findings show that self-reported health (SRH), activities of daily living (ADLs), and diabetes mellitus appear to be negatively related to the income share of rich people when average income is equalized among counties, which indicates that individuals’ health will deteriorate as the income share of rich people increases. In addition, our results show that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between income inequality, as measured by the county-level Gini coefficient, and individuals’ health status. We also find that income inequality affects health through the accessibility of healthcare facilities and public infrastructures and through hazardous health behaviours such as smoking and alcohol use. These findings suggest that reducing income inequality could be an important means of improving the overall health of China’s population."
https://openalex.org/W4207019034,"Pharmaceutical care has been implemented and regulated differently across Europe with no consensus among countries in relation with professional competencies and especially on nurse prescribing. Demophac Project funded by the European Commission aims to develop a Pan-European Pharmaceutical Care Model with collaboration of 14 partner teams across Europe including Spain where nurse prescribing is starting its implementation at regional level. The aim of the study was to increase understanding of the role of nurses in Pharmaceutical care in Spain after the Nurse Prescribing Regulation approved in 2018 throughout exploring the views and expectations of health professionals involved in the representative settings.In depth interviews were conducted in a structure previously agreed by the European Demophac partnership around four topics associated with the Nursing ideal role in pharmaceutical care and the ideal interaction with other healthcare professionals. A grounded-theory approach based on Corbin & Strauss was conducted to interpret collected data from the Spanish most representative settings (primary care, specialized care and residential care for older population). Participants were health professionals involved in pharmaceutical care that accepted to participate (nurses (n = 7), physicians (n = 8) and pharmacists (n = 9)). A pharmaceutical care comprehensive model for the Spanish context considering the recently approved Nurse Prescribing role and the interprofessional collaboration and communication was developed towards facilitating the understanding in such context and the contribution to the unified European Demophac Framework.Nurses are primarily responsible for population's Pharmaceutical Care while other professionals pivot on them to provide quality healthcare on a multidisciplinary level. Nurse prescribing may contribute efficiently to the Spanish Health System though more consensus in terms of nurses' training nationwide and enhancement in communication among different professionals within healthcare organizations is required to achieve adequate integrated care into practice."
https://openalex.org/W4207066752,"Accepting gifts from pharmaceutical sales representatives (sales reps) or meeting them is correlated with excessive, more expensive and sometimes less rational prescribing. French general practitioners (GPs) tend to hold an unfavorable opinion of the pharmaceutical industry, yet the behavior they adopt with sales reps is generally favorable. Until now, no study has sought to explain the reasons for this discrepancy. This study explores GP experiences to better understand their ambivalent behavior.This qualitative descriptive study was based on semi-structured face-to-face interviews with French GPs in the south-east of France. An interpretative phenomenological approach was chosen to explore individual professional practices and to model the phenomenon through in-depth analysis of semi-structured interviews. A general inductive analysis was carried out. Data were analyzed by researchers from different disciplines (psychology, sociology and general practice).Ten GPs were interviewed for an average of 50 minutes. The analysis revealed three forces that combine to motivate GPs to keep meeting sales reps despite their unfavorable opinion of these visits: practical reasons such as the need for a substitute for continuing education; social and cultural reasons such as courtesy towards representatives; and psychological mechanisms such as cognitive dissonance and a hidden curriculum.The GP-representative relationship is complex and involves psychological mechanisms that the medical profession often fails to recognize. GPs use reps as a convenient tool for continuing education, particularly in the setting of a private practice where GPs feel pressed for time. Cognitive dissonance is a well-supported theory in social psychology that explains how a person maintains a behavior while having an unfavorable opinion of it. Since GP meetings with sales reps start during their internship, they could also be considered as part of a hidden curriculum. The strength of this work is to combine medical, social psychological and sociological perspectives with the original interpretative phenomenological approach. When the veil is lifted on individual ambivalence, the questions raised are more social and political than individual."
https://openalex.org/W4225340699,"In Burundi most small-scale farmers still grow traditional cassava landraces that are adapted to local conditions and have been selected for consumer preferred attributes. They tend to be susceptible, in varying degrees, to devastating cassava viral diseases such as Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) and Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) with annual production losses of US$1 billion. For long term resistance to the disease, several breeding strategies have been proposed. A sound basis for a breeding program is to understand the genetic diversity of both landraces and elite introduced breeding cultivars. This will also assist in efforts to conserve landraces ahead of the broad distribution of improved varieties which have the possibility of replacing landraces. Our study aimed at determining the genetic diversity and relationships within and between local landraces and introduced elite germplasm using morphological and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. A total of 118 cultivars were characterized for morphological trait variation based on leaf, stem and root traits, and genetic variation using SNP markers. Results of morphological characterization based on Ward’s Method revealed three main clusters and five accessions sharing similar characteristics. Molecular characterization identified over 18,000 SNPs and six main clusters and three pairs of duplicates which should be pooled together as one cultivar to avoid redundancy. Results of population genetic analysis showed low genetic distance between populations and between local landraces and elite germplasm. Accessions that shared similar morphological traits were divergent at the molecular level indicating that clustering using morphological traits was inconsistent. Despite the variabilities found within the collection, it was observed that cassava germplasm in Burundi have a narrow genetic base."
https://openalex.org/W4206940859,"Our aim was to develop a method for estimating the number of animals using a single site in an asynchronous species, meaning that not all animals are present at once so that no one count captures the entire population. This is a common problem in seasonal breeders, and in northern elephant seals, we have a model for quantifying asynchrony at the Año Nuevo colony. Here we test the model at several additional colonies having many years of observations and demonstrate how it can account for animals not present on any one day. This leads to correction factors that yield total population from any single count throughout a season. At seven colonies in California for which we had many years of counts of northern elephant seals, we found that female arrival date varied &lt; 2 days between years within sites and by &lt; 5 days between sites. As a result, the correction factor for any one day was consistent, and at each colony, multiplying a female count between 26 and 30 Jan by 1.15 yielded an estimate of total population size that minimized error. This provides a method for estimating the female population size at colonies not yet studied. Our method can produce population estimates with minimal expenditure of time and resources and will be applicable to many seasonal species with asynchronous breeding phenology, particularly colonial birds and other pinnipeds. In elephant seals, it will facilitate monitoring the population over its entire range."

Whilst educators have identified many challenges to providing this support (e.g. non-core role, stigma, overcrowded curriculum), understanding clinicians' views on the role of educators and schools and how clinicians and schools could work together to achieve good mental health outcomes are important questions. However, clinician voices in how schools and health should work together for children's mental health care are frequently missing from the debate. We aimed to report clinicians' views about how the education system could support student's mental health and improve access to mental health care for children and adolescents.143 clinicians (approximately 35 each of child and adolescent psychiatrists, pediatricians, child psychologists and general practitioners (GPs)) from the states of Victoria and South Australia participated in semi-structured phone interviews between March 2018 and February 2019. Inductive content analysis was applied to address the broad study aims.Key themes emerged: (1) The role of schools in supporting individual children; (2) School based programs to support children and families; and (3) Challenges of implementing these suggestions. Clinicians across all professional groups suggested the education system could play an important role in improving access to mental health services through harnessing existing staff or co-locating mental health clinicians. They also suggested schools could identify at risk children and implement coping and social skills programs.Schools and educators could play a key role in prevention and early intervention of children's mental health problems. However, before recommending exactly how to do this, key evidence gaps need to be addressed."
https://openalex.org/W4206947487,"Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are a leading cause of deaths worldwide, yet the diagnosis and treatment of this group of diseases represent a significant challenge for clinicians. The epidemiology of ACS is extremely complex and the relationship between ACS and patient risk factors is typically non-linear and highly variable across patient lifespan. Here, we aim to uncover deeper insights into the factors that shape ACS outcomes in hospitals across four Arabian Gulf countries. Further, because anemia is one of the most observed comorbidities, we explored its role in the prognosis of most prevalent ACS in-hospital outcomes (mortality, heart failure, and bleeding) in the region. We used a robust multi-algorithm interpretable machine learning (ML) pipeline, and 20 relevant risk factors to fit predictive models to 4,044 patients presenting with ACS between 2012 and 2013. We found that in-hospital heart failure followed by anemia was the most important predictor of mortality. However, anemia was the first most important predictor for both in-hospital heart failure, and bleeding. For all in-hospital outcome, anemia had remarkably non-linear relationships with both ACS outcomes and patients' baseline characteristics. With minimal statistical assumptions, our ML models had reasonable predictive performance (AUCs > 0.75) and substantially outperformed commonly used statistical and risk stratification methods. Moreover, our pipeline was able to elucidate ACS risk of individual patients based on their unique risk factors. Fully interpretable ML approaches are rarely used in clinical settings, particularly in the Middle East, but have the potential to improve clinicians' prognostic efforts and guide policymakers in reducing the health and economic burdens of ACS worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W4206949144,"Chagas disease is mainly transmitted by triatomine insect vectors that feed on vertebrate blood. The disease has complex domiciliary infestation patterns and parasite transmission dynamics, influenced by biological, ecological, and socioeconomic factors. In this context, feeding patterns have been used to understand vector movement and transmission risk. Recently, a new technique using Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) targeting hemoglobin peptides has showed excellent results for understanding triatomines' feeding patterns. The aim of this study was to further develop the automated computational analysis pipeline for peptide sequence taxonomic identification, enhancing the ability to analyze large datasets data. We then used the enhanced pipeline to evaluate the feeding patterns of Triatoma dimidiata, along with domiciliary infestation risk variables, such as unkempt piles of firewood or construction material, cracks in bajareque and adobe walls and intradomiciliary animals. Our new python scripts were able to detect blood meal sources in 100% of the bugs analyzed and identified nine different species of blood meal sources. Human, chicken, and dog were the main blood sources found in 78.7%, 50.4% and 44.8% of the bugs, respectively. In addition, 14% of the bugs feeding on chicken and 15% of those feeding on dogs were captured in houses with no evidence of those animals being present. This suggests a high mobility among ecotopes and houses. Two of the three main blood sources, dog and chicken, were significantly (p < 0.05) affected by domiciliary infestation risk variables, including cracks in walls, construction material and birds sleeping in the intradomicile. This suggests that these variables are important for maintaining reproducing Triatoma dimidiata populations and that it is critical to mitigate these variables in all the houses of a village for effective control of these mobile vectors."
https://openalex.org/W4206992800,"Transport layer security (TLS) protocol is the most widely used security protocol in modern network communications. However, protocol vulnerabilities caused by the design of the network protocol or its implementation by programmers emerge one after another. Meanwhile, various versions of TLS protocol implementations exhibit different behavioral characteristics. Researchers are attempting to find the differences in protocol implementations based on differential testing, which is conducive to discovering the vulnerabilities. This paper provides a solution to find the differences more efficiently by targeting the TLS protocol handshake process. The differences of different implementations during the fuzzing process, such as code coverage and response data, are taken to guide the mutation of test cases, and the seeds are mutated based on the TLS protocol syntax. In addition, the definition of duplicate discrepancies is theoretically explored to investigate the root cause of the discrepancies and to reduce the number of duplicate cases that are caused by the same reason. Besides, the necessary conditions for excluding duplicate cases are further analyzed to develop the deduplication strategy. The proposed method is developed based on open-source tools, i.e., NEZHA and TLS-diff. Three types of widely used TLS protocol implementations, i.e., OpenSSL, BoringSSL, and LibreSSL, are taken for experimental testing. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the ability to find differences between different implementations. Under the same test scale or the same time, the amount of discrepancies increases by about 20% compared to TLS-diff, indicating the effectiveness of the deduplication strategy."
https://openalex.org/W4207010178,"This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of genetic selection (Lines A and B; Line A pigs have a greater proportion of Pietrain genes than those from Line B and therefore, selected for improved lean tissue accretion) on the feeding behavior of group-housed pigs exposed to daily cyclic high ambient temperatures. Feeding behavior of 78 barrows housed together in a single room was recorded in real time by five automatic feeders. The feeders registered each visit of each pig (day, hour, min, and second) and the amount of feed requested. Daily cyclic high ambient temperature was induced exposing pigs at 22°C from 18.00 to 10.00 h and 30°C from 10.01 to 17.59 h. From this temperature variation, day-period was divided into: 22°C(06-10h), from 6.00 to 10.00 h; 30°C(10-18h), from 10.01 to 17.59 h; and 22°C(18-06h), from 18.00 to 5.59 h. Meal criteria was estimated based on the probability of animals starting a new feeding event within the next minute since the last visit (Pstart). After defining the meal criteria, the number of meals (n), feed intake rate (g/min), feed intake (g/meal), feeder occupancy (min/meal), and interval between meals (min) of each animal were calculated. Greatest probability of starting to feed was observed at 22°C(06-10h), followed by 30°C(10-18h) and then 22°C(18-06h). Regardless of time period, pigs from line A had greater feed intake rate and lower feed intake, feed occupancy per meal and probability of starting a meal when compared with line B pigs. Only line A pigs had greater feed intake and feeder occupancy per meal at 22°C(18-06h) than remainder of the day. This indicates that pig feeding pattern is strongly related to the circadian rhythm. However, the genetic selection for improved lean tissue accretion may modulate pigs feeding behavior under daily cyclic high ambient temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W4207012990,"In digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) systems, projection data are acquired from a limited number of angles. Consequently, the reconstructed images contain severe blurring artifacts that might heavily degrade the DBT image quality and cause difficulties in detecting lesions. In this study, we propose a two-phase learning approach for artifact compensation in a coarse-to-fine manner to mitigate blurring artifacts effectively along all viewing directions of the DBT image volume (i.e., along the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes) to improve the detection performance of lesions. The proposed method employs a convolutional neural network model comprising two submodels/phases, with Phase 1 performing three-dimensional (3D) deblurring and Phase 2 performing additional 2D deblurring. To investigate the effects of loss functions on the proposed model's deblurring performance, we evaluated several loss functions, such as the pixel-based loss function, adversarial-based loss function, and perception-based loss function. Compared with the DBT image, the mean squared error of the image and the root mean squared errors of the gradient of the image decreased by 82.8% and 44.9%, respectively, and the contrast-to-noise ratio increased by 183.4% in the in-focus plane. We verified that the proposed method sequentially restored the missing frequency components as the DBT images were processed through the Phase 1 and Phase 2 steps. These results indicate that the proposed method performs effective 3D deblurring, significantly reducing the blurring artifacts in the in-focus plane and other planes of the DBT image, thus improving the detection performance of lesions."

This study investigates how and when transformational leadership produces divergent effects on safety compliance. Using a time-lagged research design, we collect data from a sample of 309 employees in the Chinese construction industry to examine the hypothesized relationship. We find that transformational leadership positively affects safety compliance through employees’ felt obligation toward their leader. However, transformational leadership also negatively impacts safety compliance through safety risk tolerance. We further show that employees’ perception of the safety climate plays a contingent role in the above processes. Specifically, a high-level perceived safety climate strengthens the positive indirect effect of transformational leadership on safety compliance through felt obligation, while a low-level perceived safety climate strengthens the negative indirect effect of transformational leadership on safety compliance through safety risk tolerance. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are also discussed."

The aim of the study was to investigate the improvement of core competency and increase interest to be a surgeon among medical students after a perioperative training through a structured learning with written record model. The mediating role of adult learning pattern on core competency was also examined.A 2-week training protocol was based on a structural learning model which included a structured written record by the learner for postoperative immediate feedback. An adult learning questionnaire (ALQ) was developed to assess learners' adult learning pattern and a clinical core competency questionnaire (CCCQ) was developed to assess learning outcomes. A two-way repeated measured of ANCOVA would be used to analyze the interaction effect of adult learning pattern and learning effect on learning outcomes.From Jan 2017 to Dec 2019, 412 medical students were enrolled in the study. The increase scores of CCCQ and a significant numbers of increase interest to be a surgeon were shown after the perioperative training. Two-way repeated measure ANOVA revealed that there were significant differences in change between pre- and post-CCCQ across four levels of ALQ (interaction effect F = 13.0, p <0.001). The more adult learning patterns medical students own, the more they will benefit from the training.The structural learning with written record model provides an effective perioperative training represented with clinical core competency and increase the interest to be a surgeon in the future.

A total of 272 potential off-target sequences was obtained and 84 polymorphic sites were identified in these sequences with a frequency equal to or greater than 1% in at least one of the populations. In the majority of cases, polymorphic sites decrease the chance of off-target cleavage and a new PAM was created, which indicates the importance of such analysis. This study highlights the importance of screening off-targets in a population-specific context using Mucopolysaccharidosis type I as an example of a problem that concerns all therapeutic treatments. Our results can have broader applications for other targets already clinically in use, as they could affect CRISPR/Cas9 safety and efficiency."

The aim of the present pilot study was hence to develop a quick and non-stressful echocardiographic method (i.e., the COOLEST method) in awake Borneo orangutans (CardiOvascular examination in awake Orangutans: Low-stress Echocardiography including Speckle Tracking imaging) and assess the variability of corresponding variables.Four adult Borneo orangutans trained to present their chest to the trainers were involved. A total of 96 TTE examinations were performed on 4 different days by a trained observer examining each orangutan 6 times per day. Each examination included four two-dimensional views, with offline assessment of 28 variables (i.e., two-dimensional (n = 12), M-mode and anatomic M-mode (n = 6), Doppler (n = 7), and speckle tracking imaging (n = 3)), representing a total of 2,688 measurements. A general linear model was used to determine the within-day and between-day coefficients of variation.Mean±SD (minimum-maximum) images acquisition duration was 3.8±1.6 minutes (1.3-6.3). All within-day and between-day coefficients of variation but one (n = 55/56, 98%) were <15%, and most (51/56, 91%) were <10% including those of speckle tracking systolic strain variables (2.7% to 5.4%).Heart morphology as well as global and regional myocardial function can be assessed in awake orangutans with good to excellent repeatability and reproducibility.This non-stressful method may be used for longitudinal cardiac follow-up in awake orangutans."
https://openalex.org/W4206942282,"Deployment of the deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained devices is a challenging task due to their limited memory and computational power. In most cases, the pruning techniques do not prune the DNNs to full extent and redundancy still exists in these models. Considering this, a mixed filter pruning approach based on principal component analysis (PCA) and geometric median is presented. First, a pre-trained model is analyzed by using PCA to identify the important filters for every layer. These important filters are then used to reconstruct the network with a fewer number of layers and a fewer number of filters per layer. A new network with optimized structure is constructed and trained on the data. Secondly, the trained model is then analyzed using geometric median as a base. The redundant filters are identified and removed which results in further compression of the network. Finally, the pruned model is fine tuned to regain the accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ILSVRC 2017 datasets show that the proposed mixed pruning approach is feasible and can compress the network to greater extent without any significant loss to accuracy. With VGG-16 on CIFAR-10, the number of operations and parameters are reduced to 18.56× and 3.33×, respectively, with almost 1% loss in the accuracy. The compression rate for AlexNet on CIFAR-10 dataset is 2.61× and 4.85× in terms of number of operations and number of parameters, respectively, with a gain of 1.2% in the accuracy. On CIFAR-100, VGG-19 is compressed by 16.02 X in terms of number of operations and 36× in terms of number of parameters with a 2.6% loss of accuracy. Similarly, the compression rate for VGG-19 network on ILSVRC 2017 dataset is 1.87× and 2.4× for operations and parameters with 0.5% loss in accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W4206963809,"Tomato zonate spot virus (TZSV), a member of the genus orthotospovirus , causes severe damage to vegetables and ornamental crops in southwest China. The NSs protein is an RNA silencing suppressor in various orthotospovirus like TZSV, but its mechanism and role in virus infection are poorly understood. Here, we observed that an NSs-GFP fusion protein was transiently expressed on the plasma membrane and Golgi bodies in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. The TZSV NSs gene was silenced and infiltrated into N . benthamiana and N . tabacum cv. K326. RT-qPCR and Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ID-ELISA) showed that the transcription and the protein expression of the NSs gene were inhibited by more than 90.00%, and the symptoms on silenced plants were alleviated. We also found that the expression of the Zingipain-2-like gene significantly decreased when the NSs gene was silenced, resulting in co-localization of the NSs-GFP and the Zingipain-2-like-mCherry fusion protein. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanism of silencing suppression by NSs, as well as its effect on systemic virus infection, and also support the theory of disease resistance breeding and control and prevention of TZSV in the field."
https://openalex.org/W4206981172,"Combating the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among bacteria requires a new class of antimicrobials, which desirably have a narrow spectrum because of their low propensity for the spread of AMR. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which target the bacterial cell membrane, are promising seeds for novel antimicrobials because the cell membrane is essential for all cells. Previously, we reported the antimicrobial and haemolytic effects of a natural AMP, magainin 2 (Mag2), isolated from the skin of Xenopus laevis (the African clawed frog), four types of synthesised Mag2 derivatives, and three types of rationally designed AMPs on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. To identify novel antimicrobial seeds, we evaluated the effect of AMPs on Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which also exhibits AMR. We also evaluated the antimicrobial effects of an AMP, NK2A, which has been reported to have antimicrobial effects on Mycoplasma bovis, in addition to Mag2 and previously synthesised seven AMPs, on four strains of M. pneumoniae using colorimetric, biofilm, and killing assays. We found that three synthesised AMPs, namely 17base-Ac6c, 17base-Hybrid, and Block, had anti-M. pneumoniae (anti-Mp) effect at 8-30 μM, whereas others, including NK2A, did not have any such effect. For the further analysis, the membrane disruption activities of AMPs were measured by propidium iodide (PI) uptake assays, which suggested the direct interaction of AMPs to the cell membrane basically following the colorimetric, biofilm, and killing assay results. PI uptake assay, however, also showed the NK2A strong interaction to cell membrane, indicating unknown anti-Mp determinant factors related to the peptide sequences. Finally, we conclude that anti-Mp effect was not simply determined by the membrane disruption activities of AMPs, but also that the sequence of AMPs were important for killing of M. pneumoniae. These findings would be helpful for the development of AMPs for M. pneumoniae."
https://openalex.org/W4207027958,"Osteosarcoma represents one of the most common bone tumours in dogs. It commonly occurs in the proximal humerus, the most affected anatomic site. Until recently, amputation or limb-sparing surgery leading to an arthrodesis coupled with chemotherapy were the only available treatments, but they often lead to complications, reduced mobility and highly impact dog’s quality of life. Prototypes of both articulated and monobloc (no mobility) patient-specific endoprostheses have been designed to spare the limb afflicted with osteosarcoma of the proximal humerus. This study focuses on the biomechanical effects of endoprostheses and shoulder muscle kinematics. For each of the endoprosthesis designs, a minimal number of muscles needed to ensure stability and a certain degree of joint movement during walking is sought. A quasi-static study based on an optimization method, the minimization of the sum of maximal muscle stresses, was carried out to assess the contribution of each muscle to the shoulder function. The identification of the most important muscles and their impact on the kinematics of the prosthetic joint lead to an improvement of the endoprosthesis design relevance and implantation feasibility."
https://openalex.org/W4207049605,"The loaded mechanical function of transtibial prostheses that result from the clinical assembly, tuning, and alignment of modular prosthetic components can directly influence an end user’s biomechanics and overall mobility. Footwear is known to affect prosthesis mechanical properties, and while the options of footwear are limited for most commercial feet due to their fixed geometry, there exists a selection of commercial prosthetic feet that can accommodate a moderate rise in heel height. These feet are particularly relevant to women prosthesis users who often desire to don footwear spanning a range of heel heights. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of adding women’s footwear (flat, trainer, 5.08 cm heel) on the mechanical properties (deformation and energy efficiency) of four models of heel-height accommodating prosthetic feet. Properties were measured through loading-unloading at simulated initial contact, midstance and terminal stance orientations with a universal materials test system, and statistically compared to a barefoot condition. Results suggest that the addition of footwear can alter the level of foot deformation under load, which may be a function of the shoe and alignment. Moreover, while each foot displayed different amounts of energy storage and return, the addition of footwear yielded similar levels of energy efficiency across foot models. Overall, prosthesis users who don shoes of varying heel heights onto adjustable prosthetic feet and their treating clinicians should be aware of the potential changes in mechanical function that could affect the user experience."
https://openalex.org/W4225764001,"High resolution in situ hybridization (ISH) images of the brain capture spatial gene expression at cellular resolution. These spatial profiles are key to understanding brain organization at the molecular level. Previously, manual qualitative scoring and informatics pipelines have been applied to ISH images to determine expression intensity and pattern. To better capture the complex patterns of gene expression in the human cerebral cortex, we applied a machine learning approach. We propose gene re-identification as a contrastive learning task to compute representations of ISH images. We train our model on an ISH dataset of ~1,000 genes obtained from postmortem samples from 42 individuals. This model reaches a gene re-identification rate of 38.3%, a 13x improvement over random chance. We find that the learned embeddings predict expression intensity and pattern. To test generalization, we generated embeddings in a second dataset that assayed the expression of 78 genes in 53 individuals. In this set of images, 60.2% of genes are re-identified, suggesting the model is robust. Importantly, this dataset assayed expression in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia. Gene and donor-specific embeddings from the model predict schizophrenia diagnosis at levels similar to that reached with demographic information. Mutations in the most discriminative gene, Sodium Voltage-Gated Channel Beta Subunit 4 (SCN4B), may help understand cardiovascular associations with schizophrenia and its treatment. We have publicly released our source code, embeddings, and models to spur further application to spatial transcriptomics. In summary, we propose and evaluate gene re-identification as a machine learning task to represent ISH gene expression images."
https://openalex.org/W4226193636,"Research in intertemporal decisions shows that people value future gains less than equivalent but immediate gains by a factor known as the discount rate (i.e., people want a premium for waiting to receive a reward). A robust phenomenon in intertemporal decisions is the finding that the discount rate is larger for small gains than for large gains, termed the magnitude effect. However, the psychological underpinnings of this effect are not yet fully understood. One explanation proposes that intertemporal choices are driven by comparisons of features of the present and future choice options (e.g., information on rewards). According to this explanation, the hypothesis is that the magnitude effect is stronger when the absolute difference between present and future rewards is emphasized, compared to when their relative difference is emphasized. However, this hypothesis has only been tested using one task (the two-choice paradigm) and only for gains (i.e., not losses). It's therefore unclear whether the findings that support the hypothesis can be generalized to different methodological paradigms (e.g., preference matching) and to the domain of losses. To address this question, we conducted experiments using the preference-matching method whereby the premium amounts that people could ask for were framed in terms of either currencies (emphasizing absolute differences) or percentages (emphasizing relative differences). We thus tested the robustness of the evidence in support of the hypothesis that percent framing, relative to currency framing, attenuates the magnitude effect in the domain of gains (Studies 1, 2, and 3) and in the domain of losses (Study 1, 3, and 4). The data were heavily skewed and the assumption of equal variances was violated. Therefore, in place of parametric statistical tests, we calculated and interpreted parametric and nonparametric standardized and unstandardized effect size estimates and their confidence intervals. Overall, the results support the hypothesis."
