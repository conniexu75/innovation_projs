Non-native and aggregation-prone forms of mutant SOD1s are thought to trigger the disease. Two sets of novel antibodies, raised in rabbits and chicken, against peptides spaced along the human SOD1 sequence, were by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and an immunocapture method shown to be specific for denatured SOD1. These were used to examine SOD1 in spinal cords of ALS patients lacking mutations in the enzyme. Small granular SOD1-immunoreactive inclusions were found in spinal motoneurons of all 37 sporadic and familial ALS patients studied, but only sparsely in 3 of 28 neurodegenerative and 2 of 19 non-neurological control patients. The granular inclusions were by confocal microscopy found to partly colocalize with markers for lysosomes but not with inclusions containing TAR DNA binding protein-43, ubiquitin or markers for endoplasmic reticulum, autophagosomes or mitochondria. Granular inclusions were also found in carriers of SOD1 mutations and in spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) patients and they were the major type of inclusion detected in ALS patients homozygous for the wild type-like D90A mutation. The findings suggest that SOD1 may be involved in ALS pathogenesis in patients lacking mutations in the enzyme."

However, molecular mechanisms linking FFA to insulin resistance remain poorly understood. Oxidative stress acts as a link between FFA and hepatic insulin resistance. NADPH oxidase 3 (NOX3)-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) may mediate the effect of TNF-α on hepatocytes, in particular the drop in cellular glycogen content. In the present study, we define the critical role of NOX3-derived ROS in insulin resistance in db/db mice and HepG2 cells treated with palmitate. The db/db mice displayed increased serum FFA levels, excess generation of ROS, and up-regulation of NOX3 expression, accompanied by increased lipid accumulation and impaired glycogen content in the liver. Similar results were obtained from palmitate-treated HepG2 cells. The exposure of palmitate elevated ROS production and NOX3 expression and, in turn, increased gluconeogenesis and reduced glycogen content in HepG2 cells. We found that palmitate induced hepatic insulin resistance through JNK and p38MAPK pathways, which are rescued by siRNA-mediated NOX3 reduction. In conclusion, our data demonstrate a critical role of NOX3-derived ROS in palmitate-induced insulin resistance in hepatocytes, indicating that NOX3 is the predominant source of palmitate-induced ROS generation and that NOX3-derived ROS may drive palmitate-induced hepatic insulin resistance through JNK and p38MAPK pathways.

Type 2 diabetes is a multifaceted disease, marked by decreased glucose peripheral uptake, increased hepatic glucose production, and decreased insulin secretion and reduced insulin sensitivity (1Guillausseau P.J.

Insulin resistance, defined as a diminished ability of cells, such as adipocytes, skeletal muscle cells, and hepatocytes, to respond to the action of insulin, plays a central role in the development of several metabolic abnormalities and diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome (2Petersen K.F.

Insulin resistance is induced by several molecules, including glucose, insulin, free fatty acids (FFAs), and certain cytokines, such as TNF-α (4Liu J. Wu X. Franklin J.L. Messina J.L. Hill H.S.

However, molecular mechanisms linking FFA to insulin resistance remain poorly understood. Oxidative stress has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. It has been suggested that increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) 3The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesNOXNADPH oxidaseIRSinsulin receptor substrateGSKglycogen synthase kinasePEPCKphosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. levels are an important trigger for insulin resistance (7Fridlyand L.E.

Enhanced ROS production can lead to abnormal changes in intracellular signaling and development of insulin resistance (8Wei Y. Sowers J.R. Nistala R. Gong H. Uptergrove G.M. Clark S.E. Morris E.M.

We recently found that NADPH oxidase 3 (NOX3)-derived ROS mediate the effect of TNF-α on hepatocytes, in particular the drop in cellular glycogen content (10Li L. He Q. Huang X. Man Y. Zhou Y. Wang S. Wang J. Li J. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate the critical role of NOX3-derived ROS in insulin resistance in db/db mice and HepG2 cells treated with palmitate. We show novel data indicating that NOX3-derived ROS may drive palmitate-induced hepatic insulin resistance through JNK and p38MAPK pathways. We obtained db/db mice (C57BL/KsJ) from the Peking University Health Science Center (originally purchased from Jackson Laboratory). Briefly, db/db mice (n = 5) and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice (n = 5) were fed a standard laboratory diet for 12 weeks in a temperature-controlled (20–24 °C) and humidity-controlled (45–55%) environment. A 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle was maintained. Blood samples were collected from hearts of mice for measurement of blood glucose, plasma FFA, glycohemoglobin, and insulin contents. Liver tissues were removed surgically and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen for further analysis. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Animal Care and Use Guidelines. All animal protocols were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee at the Beijing Institute of Geriatrics. HepG2 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium (low glucose; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained at 37 °C with humidified air and CO2 (5%). Glycogen levels were measured in cells or liver tissues incubated for 3 h in the presence of 1 nm insulin (Usbio), using a glycogen assay kit (Biovision). Cells were washed three times with PBS to remove glucose, incubated for 16 h in 1 ml of glucose production medium (glucose- and phenol red-free DMEM containing gluconeogenic substrates, 20 mm sodium lactate, and 2 mm sodium pyruvate) and in the presence of 1 nm insulin (Usbio) during the last 3 h. A quantity of 300 μl of medium was sampled for measurement of glucose concentration using a glucose assay kit (Sigma). Glucose concentration was normalized with cellular protein concentration (11Ito Y. Oumi S. Nagasawa T. Nishizawa N. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2006; 70: 2191-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells (3 × 105 cells/ml) were incubated with 5 μm 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Sigma) for 40 min at 37 °C. The 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein fluorescence was measured by FACS. The sections of OCT-embedded liver tissues were incubated with 10 μm DHE (Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature. The sections were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Cell lysates (15–30 μg of protein) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore), blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, and probed with antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-IgG, followed by detection with ECL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against IRS-1, phospho-IRS-1 (Ser307), p38MAPK, phospho-p38MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182), phospho-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), JNK, Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser473), GSK, phospho-GSK (Ser9), PTEN, and phospho-PTEN (Ser380/Thr382/Thr383) were all purchased from Cell Signaling. Antibodies against NOX3, p22phox, p47phox, p67phox, Rac1, β-actin, FOXO1, phospho-FOXO1 (Ser256), and PEPCK were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. After incubation in the presence or absence of palmitate for 24 h, confluent cell monolayer was fixed in phosphate-buffered formalin (10%) for 10 min, rinsed with water followed by 70% ethanol, and stained with Oil Red O solution (6 parts of saturated Oil Red O dye in isopropyl alcohol + 4 parts of water) for 15 min. Excess stain was removed by washing with 70% ethanol. The stained cells were finally washed with water. The cell monolayer was then incubated for 5 min with 1.5 ml of 4% Nonidet P-40 in isopropyl alcohol, which dissolved stained oil droplets. The absorbance of the dye-triglyceride complex was measured at 520 nm after suitable dilution. The siRNA targeting the human NOX3 mRNA was transfected into HepG2 cells using Tran MessengerTM transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A luciferase siRNA (FAM) was used as a negative control. RNAi oligonucleotides are as follows: for NOX3, 5′-ACACGGAUGAGUGAGCAGGTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCUGCUCACUCAUCCGUGUTT-3′ (antisense); for negative control FAM, 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3′ (antisense). All values are represented as means ± S.D. of the indicated number of measurements. A one-way analysis of variance test was used to determine significance, requiring p < 0.05 for statistical significance. To examine the causal role of elevated plasma FFA levels in hepatic insulin resistance, db/db mice (n = 5) were fed a standard laboratory diet for 12 weeks. Plasma insulin levels in db/db mice were increased, suggesting compromised insulin sensitivity (Fig. 1A). Importantly, db/db mice displayed elevated glycohemoglobin levels (Fig. 1B) and plasma FFA levels (Fig. 1C). We also found that glycogen levels in the livers of db/db mice were significantly decreased, demonstrating a state of insulin resistance (Fig. 1D). It is noteworthy that Oil Red O staining for lipofuchsin shows lipid accumulation in the livers of db/db mice (Fig. 1E). ROS generation also was significantly elevated in the livers of db/db mice (Fig. 1F), suggesting that ROS may be a link between FFA and insulin resistance. To extend these observations from db/db mice to a cellular model of insulin resistance, human HepG2 hepatocytes were treated with different concentrations of palmitate (0.15, 0.25, and 0.35 mm) to induce insulin resistance, as assessed by their decreased intracellular glycogen synthesis. We also quantified cell viability in different concentrations of palmitate-treated HepG2 by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay to exclude the side effects associated with palmitate, such as apoptosis. The results indicate that glycogen content was significantly impaired, and no cytotoxicity was seen in connection with the time of exposure to palmitate (0.25 mm, 24 h) (data not shown). Therefore, we chose 0.25 mm palmitate used in HepG2 incubation. In previous studies, 0.25 mm palmitate was used to induce insulin resistance in the rat hepatocyte cell line H4IIEC3 (9Nakamura S. Takamura T. Matsuzawa-Nagata N. Takayama H. Misu H. Noda H. Nabemoto S. Kurita S. Ota T. Ando H. Miyamoto K. Kaneko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 14809-14818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). As shown in (Fig. 2A), glycogen content in HepG2 cells treated with palmitate (0.25 mm) for 24 h was significantly impaired. Exposure of HepG2 cells to palmitate enhanced gluconeogenesis, as shown by a glucose production assay (Fig. 2B). Similarly, Oil Red O staining shows increased lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells treated with palmitate (Fig. 2C). We next investigated whether ROS levels were altered by palmitate treatment. As shown in Fig. 2, D and E, ROS levels were increased in HepG2 cells by exposure to palmitate. In order to further assess the source of ROS production, we observed the effects of different inhibitors of ROS-generating systems: diphenyliodonium (NOX inhibitor; 2.5 μm), NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor; 50 μm), rotenone (mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitor; 1 μm), and oxypurinol (xanthine oxidase inhibitor; 50 μm) on palmitate-induced increased ROS levels. Similarly, there was no cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells treated with inhibitors (data not shown). However, diphenyliodonium significantly and rotenone partially (but not NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester and oxypurinol) inhibited generation of ROS in response to palmitate (0.25 mm, 24 h) (Fig. 2F). These results suggest NOX as a leading candidate for production of ROS in HepG2 cells. The members of NOX family, including NOX1, NOX2, NOX3, NOX4, and NOX5, have been identified in different tissues and cells (12Bedard K. Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 245-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (5040) Google Scholar). Using RT-PCR, we have found expression of NOX3 and subunits, such as p22phox, p67phox, p47phox, and Rac1 (but not NOX1, NOX2, NOX4, and NOX5) in HepG2 cells and rat hepatic tissue. In the present study, we examined effects of palmitate treatment on expression of NOX3 and subunits in HepG2 cells. As expected, palmitate significantly up-regulated expression of NOX3, but not Rac1, p47phox, and p22phox (Fig. 3A). However, NOX1, NOX2, NOX4, and NOX5 were also not expressed in palmitate-treated HepG2 cells (data not shown). The results show that palmitate increased ROS generation through up-regulation of NOX3 expression. Increased expression of NOX3, Rac1, p47phox, and p22phox, accompanied by elevated production of ROS, was also found in the livers of db/db mice (Fig. 3B). To further assess the role of NOX3 in palmitate-induced increased ROS generation in HepG2 cells, we generated the siRNA targeting NOX3 mRNA (siRNA-NOX3) and transfected them into HepG2 cells. Western blot analysis indicates that transfection with siRNA-NOX3 significantly down-regulates NOX3 expression both in control and in palmitate-treated cells, whereas control siRNA has no effect (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, transfection of siRNA-NOX3, but not control siRNA, significantly reduced ROS generation in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these observations point to NOX3 as the possible predominant source of ROS generation stimulated by palmitate. We then investigated what downstream pathways translate palmitate-induced elevated ROS levels into hepatic insulin resistance. ROS have been shown to induce various signaling pathways, including the p38MAPK, ERK, and JNK pathways. One attractive possibility is that ROS-induced insulin resistance is mediated by JNK. It is known that ROS promote activation of JNK (13Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). Inhibition of JNK activity through genetic knock-out or an inhibitor improves insulin sensitivity in mice (14Nakatani Y. Kaneto H. Kawamori D. Hatazaki M. Miyatsuka T. Matsuoka T.A. Kajimoto Y. Matsuhisa M. Yamasaki Y. Hori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45803-45809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, JNK was activated in response to palmitate treatment in HepG2 cells. In parallel with increased phosphorylation of JNK, phosphorylation of the residue Ser307 in IRS-1 was stimulated by palmitate treatment. Similarly, exposure to palmitate elevated the phosphorylation of p38MAPK and its downstream PTEN. Palmitate-induced activation of JNK and p38MAPK led to impaired phosphorylation of Akt, GSK, and FOXO1. Increased PEPCK levels in turn resulted in decreased glycogen synthesis and increased gluconeogenesis. These changes of JNK and p38MAPK pathways are consistent with data from db/db mice (Fig. 4B). To test if JNK and p38MAPK function as signaling intermediates in the cascade linking palmitate and hepatic insulin resistance, we further examined cellular glycogen levels in palmitate-stimulated HepG2 cells pretreated with JNK inhibitor SP600125 (10 μm) and p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (20 μm) for 30 min. As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, pretreatment of HepG2 cells with SP600125 or SB203580 can reverse decreased cellular glycogen levels and increased gluconeogenesis induced by palmitate. Effects of palmitate on activation of JNK and p38MAPK pathways were rescued via SP600125 and SB203580 treatment (Fig. 4, E and F). These results suggest that palmitate induced hepatic insulin resistance through JNK and p38MAPK pathways. This corroborates previous studies in rat hepatocyte H4IIEC3 (9Nakamura S. Takamura T. Matsuzawa-Nagata N. Takayama H. Misu H. Noda H. Nabemoto S. Kurita S. Ota T. Ando H. Miyamoto K. Kaneko S. J. Biol.

Palmitate (0.25 mm, 24 h) elevated phosphorylation of JNK, p38MAPK, PTEN, and IRS-1 (Ser307); impaired phosphorylation of AKT, GSK, and FOXO1; and increased PEPCK levels in HepG2 cells (A). Similar results were obtained from db/db mice (B). Pretreatment of HepG2 cells with JNK inhibitor SP600125 (10 μm) and p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (20 μm) for 30 min can reverse palmitate-induced decreased glycogen synthesis (C) and increased gluconeogenesis (D) and the activation of JNK and p38MAPK pathways (E and F). All experiments for analysis of IRS-1, AKT, GSK, FOXO1, and PEPCK in HepG2 cells were performed in the presence of 1 nm insulin. Data represent means ± S.D.

The results show that NOX3 down-regulation suppressed palmitate-induced decreased glycogen synthesis and increased gluconeogenesis (Fig. 5, A and B). Effects of palmitate on activation of JNK and p38MAPK pathways were rescued via siRNA-mediated silencing of NOX3 (Fig. 5C). Insulin resistance precedes development of type 2 diabetes, which may occur in major metabolic tissues and organs, including muscle, adipose tissue, and liver. FFA has been proposed as a link between obesity and insulin resistance because there is an elevation of plasma FFA levels in obese animals and humans (15Boden G. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. 2008; 37 (viii–ix.): 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Increased plasma concentrations of FFA lead to intramyocellular lipid accumulation in humans, suggesting that FFA may play a critical role in initiating and developing insulin resistance (16McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar, 17Azevedo-Martins A.K. Monteiro A.P. Lima C.L. Lenzen S. Curi R. Toxicol. In Vitro. 2006; 20: 1106-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Our study found increased levels of insulin, glucose, and glycohemoglobin in blood, accompanied by elevated FFA levels in db/db mice. It is known that insulin resistance occurs in certain tissues, such as fat, muscle, and liver. But liver becomes resistant first, followed by muscle and, last, fat. Insulin resistance in the liver leads to impaired glycogen synthesis and failure to suppress glucose production (18Samuel V.T. Liu Z.X. Qu X. Elder B.D. Bilz S. Befroy D. Romanelli A.J. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32345-32353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Plasma FFAs are composed of the saturated fatty acid palmitate (about 30–35%) and of the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate (about 40–50%). Thus, in vivo, the effects observed may have been caused by a mix of fatty acids or other plasma components. However, observational studies assessing fatty acid composition in serum or tissues suggest that insulin resistance is associated with relatively high intake of saturated fat (e.g. palmitic acid) and low intake of polyunsaturated fat (e.g. linoleic acid), findings that are supported by recent clinical data (19Risérus U. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2008; 11: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Consumption of a high saturated fat diet decreased insulin sensitivity in comparison with a high monounsaturated fat diet (20Galgani J.E. Uauy R.D. Aguirre C.A. Díaz E.O. Br. J. Nutr. 2008; 100: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because animal models of insulin resistance are complex and may be accompanied by alterations not restricted to the liver, it is difficult to determine the contribution of FFAs to hepatic insulin resistance. Therefore, the finding that db/db mice displayed a lipid accumulation and decreased glycogen content in the liver (Fig. 1, D and E), and the possibility that high levels of FFA may lead to hepatic insulin resistance need to be assessed in vitro. Importantly, it has been reported that a saturated fatty acid (palmitate) but not a monounsaturated fatty acid (oleate) induced insulin resistance in rat hepatocytes H4IIEC3 (9Nakamura S. Takamura T. Matsuzawa-Nagata N. Takayama H. Misu H. Noda H. Nabemoto S. Kurita S. Ota T. Ando H. Miyamoto K. Kaneko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 14809-14818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we stimulated HepG2 cells with 0.25 mm palmitate for 24 h. The results indicate that palmitate treatment decreased glycogen content, increased gluconeogenesis, and increased lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells, suggesting a state of insulin resistance (Fig. 2, A–C). What is the molecular link between FFA and insulin resistance? It is thought that oxidative stress may play an important role in decreasing insulin responsiveness (21Evans J.L. Goldfine I.D. Maddux B.A. Grodsky G.M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 22Urakawa H. Katsuki A. Sumida Y. Gabazza E.C. Murashima S. Morioka K. Maruyama N. Kitagawa N. Tanaka T. Hori Y. Nakatani K. Yano Y. Adachi Y. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 4673-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Recently, it has also been shown that chronic exposure to elevated fatty acid concentrations can damage different types of cells by a variety of mechanisms, but oxidative stress may be a common link in cell dysfunction (23Kahn S.E. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 3-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kajimoto Y. Kaneto H. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1011: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Increased FFA metabolism may also lead to increased ROS production. It has been reported that glucose or FFA initiates formation of ROS in muscle, adipocytes, and pancreatic β-cells (25Talior I. Yarkoni M. Bashan N. Eldar-Finkelman H. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 285: E295-E302Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 26Brownlee M. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 1615-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (4035) Google Scholar, 27Haber E.P. Procópio J. Carvalho C.R. Carpinelli A.R. Newsholme P. Curi R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2006; 248: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our results show enhanced ROS production in the livers of db/db mice (Fig. 1F) and demonstrate that palmitate elevated ROS production in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2, D and E), resulting in hepatic insulin resistance. These observations suggest that ROS may be the link between FFA and insulin resistance. However, the data raised the issue of the source of ROS generation in palmitate-induced insulin resistance. It is thought that ROS are produced via multiple processes, such as mitochondrial electron transport chain, NOX, nitric-oxide synthase, and xanthine oxidase. Among these possibilities, recent attention has focused on NOX as a potential source of ROS production in insulin resistance conditions (28Delbosc S. Paizanis E. Magous R. Araiz C. Dimo T. Cristol J.P. Cros G. Azay J. Atherosclerosis. 2005; 179: 43-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). By observing the effects of different inhibitors of ROS-generating systems, we demonstrate that NOX may be the predominant source of ROS in HepG2 cells, although rotenone, a mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitor, may partially inhibit generation of ROS in response to palmitate (Fig. 2F). Recently, we analyzed the expression of NOX families in hepatocytes. RT-PCR indicated expression of NOX3 and subunits such as p22phox, p47phox, p67phox, and Rac1, but not NOX1, NOX2, NOX4, and NOX5, in HepG2 cells and rat hepatic tissue (10Li L. He Q. Huang X. Man Y. Zhou Y. Wang S. Wang J. Li J. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our study found a similar expression pattern of NOX and partners in hepatic tissue of db/db mice. Exposure of HepG2 to palmitate stimulated the generation of ROS and up-regulated the expression of NOX3 (Fig. 3A). It is noteworthy that increased NOX3 expression accompanied by elevated production of ROS was also found in the livers of db/db mice (Fig. 3B). NOX3 down-regulation by transfection of siRNA-NOX3 led to reduced ROS generation and, in turn, impaired insulin resistance in palmitate-treated HepG2 cells (Figs. 3D and 5, A and B). Taken together, we believe that this provides a strong argument for the critical role of NOX3-derived ROS in hepatic insulin resistance in HepG2 cells. However, determination of whether NOX3 is a source of ROS production in vivo and the mechanism by which palmitate up-regulates expression NOX3 will require further investigation. It is well known that excessive levels of ROS not only directly damage cells by oxidizing DNA, protein, and lipid but also indirectly damage cells by activating a variety of stress-sensitive intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-κB, p38MAPK, and JNK/SAPK (29Klaunig J.E. Kamendulis L.M. Hocevar B.A. Toxicol. Pathol. 2010; 38: 96-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 30Ghosh J. Das J. Manna P. Sil P.C. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2009; 240: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Activation of these pathways results in increased expression of numerous gene products that may cause cellular damage and play a major role in insulin resistance (31Wei Y. Sowers J.R. Clark S.E. Li W. Ferrario C.M. Stump C.S. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 294: E345-E351Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 32Evans J.L. Goldfine I.D. Maddux B.A. Grodsky G.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 599-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar, 33Davis J.E. Gabler N.K. Walker-Daniels J. Spurlock M.E. Horm. Metab. Res. 2009; 41: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 34Kaneto H. Kawamori D. Nakatani Y. Gorogawa S. Matsuoka T.A. Drug News Perspect. 2004; 17: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has been proposed that there is a link among the FFA-induced increased ROS generation, activation of stress-sensitive pathways, and eventual development of insulin resistance. Although the current in vitro study may not reflect the in vivo situation, there is strong evidence for oxidative stress-dependent changes in intracellular signaling, resulting in insulin resistance in vivo (35Katakam A.K. Chipitsyna G. Gong Q. Vancha A.R. Gabbeta J. Arafat H.A. J. Endocrinol. 2005; 187: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). From a mechanistic perspective, increased reactive molecules can trigger activation of stress-sensitive serine/threonine kinase signaling pathways, such as JNK and p38MAPK, that, in turn, phosphorylate multiple targets, including the insulin receptor and IRS proteins (36Bloch-Damti A. Bashan N. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 reduces its ability to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation and may accelerate the degradation of IRS-1, followed by reduced Akt/protein kinase B phosphorylation. This offers a plausible explanation for the molecular basis of oxidative stress-induced decreased glycogen content in the liver (37Archuleta T.L. Lemieux A.M. Saengsirisuwan V. Teachey M.K. Lindborg K.A. Kim J.S. Henriksen E.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 47: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The link between Akt/protein kinase B and glycogen synthesis is established. It is demonstrated that Akt/protein kinase B phosphorylates and inhibits GSK-3 directly, which contributes to increased activation of glycogen synthase (38Jensen J. Jebens E. Brennesvik E.O. Ruzzin J. Soos M.A. Engebretsen E.M. O'Rahilly S. Whitehead J.P. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 290: E154-E162Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). GSK-3 is a serine/threonine protein kinase first identified by its ability to phosphorylate and inactivate glycogen synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme in glycogen synthesis (39Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar), with important roles in the regulation of glycogen synthesis. Insulin administration results in serine phosphorylation and thus inactivation of GSK-3, thereby leading to an increase in glycogen synthase activity (40Ciaraldi T.P. Oh D.K. Christiansen L. Nikoulina S.E. Kong A.P. Baxi S. Mudaliar S. Henry R.R. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 291: E891-E898Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, oxidative stress-induced reduced Akt/protein kinase B phosphorylation leads to impaired phosphorylation of GSK, followed by suppressed glycogen synthase activity, resulting in decreased glycogen synthesis. Our results show that exposure of HepG2 cells to palmitate promoted phosphorylation of JNK and p38MAPK, leading to increased phosphorylation of the residue Ser307 in IRS-1 and PTEN, accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of Akt and GSK, followed by reduced glycogen content in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4A). Similar data of signaling pathway changes were obtained from db/db mice (Fig. 4B). Effects of palmitate on cellular glycogen levels and gluconeogenesis and activation of JNK/p38MAPK pathways were rescued via pretreatment of JNK inhibitor SP600125 (10 μm) and p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (20 μm) for 30 min (Fig. 4, C–F). Our results suggest that palmitate induced hepatic insulin resistance through JNK and p38MAPK pathways. However, it has been suggested that the effect on JNK and p38MAPK pathways is not specific to palmitate. It can also arise from exposure to other long- and medium-chain fatty acids (41Kadotani A. Tsuchiya Y. Hatakeyama H. Katagiri H. Kanzaki M. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 297: E1291-E1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 42Ragheb R. Shanab G.M. Medhat A.M. Seoudi D.M.

Neuroscience. 2007; 146: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Interestingly, others have demonstrated that a saturated fatty acid (palmitate) but not a monounsaturated fatty acid (oleate) inhibited insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 and serine phosphorylation of Akt through JNK activation in rat H4IIEC3 cells (9Nakamura S. Takamura T. Matsuzawa-Nagata N. Takayama H. Misu H. Noda H. Nabemoto S. Kurita S. Ota T. Ando H. Miyamoto K. Kaneko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 14809-14818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Most importantly, we found that palmitate-induced activation of JNK and p38MAPK was rescued by siRNA-mediated NOX3 reduction (Fig. 5C). Regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis is another important process in regulation of blood glucose levels, and pathological changes in glucose production of liver are a central characteristic in type 2 diabetes (44Basu R. Chandramouli V. Dicke B. Landau B. Rizza R. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 1942-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 45Gastaldelli A. Baldi S. Pettiti M. Toschi E. Camastra S. Natali A. Landau B.R. Ferrannini E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1367-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It is known that increased hepatic gluconeogenesis is induced by overexpression of PEPCK, a key gluconeogenic enzyme, and the catalytic subunit glucose-6-phosphatase, which is regulated by transcriptional and nontranscriptional mechanisms (46Seo H.Y. Kim M.K. Min A.K. Kim H.S. Ryu S.Y. Kim N.K. Lee K.M. Kim H.J. Choi H.S. Lee K.U. Park K.G. Lee I.K. Endocrinology. 2010; 151: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 47Yu X. Huang Y. Hu Q. Ma L. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2009; 41: 1027-1032Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). PEPCK catalyzes one of the rate-limiting steps of gluconeogenesis, the reaction of oxaloacetic acid to phosphoenolpyruvate, contributing to increased hepatic glucose output and elevated blood glucose levels in the initial stages of type 2 diabetes characterized by insulin resistance (48Wu M. Wang X. Duan Q. Lu T. Ann. Nutr. Metab. 2007; 51: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Expression of PEPCK is regulated by Akt and FOXO1. Overexpression and activation of Akt in hepatoma cells and primary hepatocyte cultures decreases PEPCK gene transcription. It has been identified that FOXO1 mediates the observed suppression of PEPCK gene transcription by Akt (49Liu H.Y. Wen G.B. Han J. Hong T. Zhuo D. Liu Z. Cao W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30642-30649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is reported that phosphorylation of FOXO1 by Akt results in transcriptional inactivation and nuclear export of FOXO1. Reporter gene analysis demonstrated transactivation of the PEPCK promoter in vitro with FOXO1 binding. In addition, overexpression of a constitutively active FOXO1 mutant, which is resistant to inactivation by insulin, increased PEPCK expression and resulted in elevated fasting blood glucose concentrations (50Altomonte J. Richter A. Harbaran S. Suriawinata J. Nakae J. Thung S.N. Meseck M. Accili D. Dong H. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 285: E718-E728Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In our studies, reduced phosphorylation of FOXO1 and increased PEPCK expression, followed by elevated glucose output, were found in HepG2 cells treated by palmitate, demonstrating the hepatic gluconeogenesis state (Fig. 4A). The db/db mice also displayed reduced phosphorylation of FOXO1 and increased PEPCK expression in the liver (Fig. 4B). In summary, as shown in Fig. 6, this study provides novel data that show the key role of NOX3-derived ROS in insulin resistance in HepG2 cells treated by palmitate. The effects of palmitate on hepatic insulin resistance are mediated by NOX3-derived ROS through JNK and p38MAPK pathways. We thank Prof. Youfei Guan (Peking University Health Science Center) for providing db/db mice."
https://openalex.org/W2101009945,"Conservationists have proposed methods for adapting to climate change that assume species distributions are primarily explained by climate variables. The key idea is to use the understanding of species-climate relationships to map corridors and to identify regions of faunal stability or high species turnover. An alternative approach is to adopt an evolutionary timescale and ask ultimately what factors control total diversity, so that over the long run the major drivers of total species richness can be protected. Within a single climatic region, the temperate area encompassing all of the Northeastern U.S. and Maritime Canada, we hypothesized that geologic factors may take precedence over climate in explaining diversity patterns. If geophysical diversity does drive regional diversity, then conserving geophysical settings may offer an approach to conservation that protects diversity under both current and future climates. Here we tested how well geology predicts the species diversity of 14 US states and three Canadian provinces, using a comprehensive new spatial dataset. Results of linear regressions of species diversity on all possible combinations of 23 geophysical and climatic variables indicated that four geophysical factors; the number of geological classes, latitude, elevation range and the amount of calcareous bedrock, predicted species diversity with certainty (adj. R2 = 0.94). To confirm the species-geology relationships we ran an independent test using 18,700 location points for 885 rare species and found that 40% of the species were restricted to a single geology. Moreover, each geology class supported 5–95 endemic species and chi-square tests confirmed that calcareous bedrock and extreme elevations had significantly more rare species than expected by chance (P<0.0001), strongly corroborating the regression model. Our results suggest that protecting geophysical settings will conserve the stage for current and future biodiversity and may be a robust alternative to species-level predictions."
https://openalex.org/W2127611043,"Normal aging is associated with a degradation of perceptual abilities and a decline in higher-level cognitive functions, notably working memory. To remediate age-related deficits, cognitive training programs are increasingly being developed. However, it is not yet definitively established if, and by what mechanisms, training ameliorates effects of cognitive aging. Furthermore, a major factor impeding the success of training programs is a frequent failure of training to transfer benefits to untrained abilities. Here, we offer the first evidence of direct transfer-of-benefits from perceptual discrimination training to working memory performance in older adults. Moreover, using electroencephalography to evaluate participants before and after training, we reveal neural evidence of functional plasticity in older adult brains, such that training-induced modifications in early visual processing during stimulus encoding predict working memory accuracy improvements. These findings demonstrate the strength of the perceptual discrimination training approach by offering clear psychophysical evidence of transfer-of-benefit and a neural mechanism underlying cognitive improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2001185357,"Readouts that define the physiological distributions of drugs in tissues are an unmet challenge and at best imprecise, but are needed in order to understand both the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties associated with efficacy. Here we demonstrate that it is feasible to follow the in vivo transport of unlabeled drugs within specific organ and tissue compartments on a platform that applies MALDI imaging mass spectrometry to tissue sections characterized with high definition histology. We have tracked and quantified the distribution of an inhaled reference compound, tiotropium, within the lungs of dosed rats, using systematic point by point MS and MS/MS sampling at 200 µm intervals. By comparing drug ion distribution patterns in adjacent tissue sections, we observed that within 15 min following exposure, tiotropium parent MS ions (mass-to-charge; m/z 392.1) and fragmented daughter MS/MS ions (m/z 170.1 and 152.1) were dispersed in a concentration gradient (80 fmol-5 pmol) away from the central airways into the lung parenchyma and pleura. These drug levels agreed well with amounts detected in lung compartments by chemical extraction. Moreover, the simultaneous global definition of molecular ion signatures localized within 2-D tissue space provides accurate assignment of ion identities within histological landmarks, providing context to dynamic biological processes occurring at sites of drug presence. Our results highlight an important emerging technology allowing specific high resolution identification of unlabeled drugs at sites of in vivo uptake and retention."

Prockter et al. (p. 668 , published online 15 July) present imaging data acquired during this flyby, showing that volcanism on Mercury has extended to much more recent times than previously assumed. The temporal extent of volcanic activity and, in particular, the timing of most recent activity had been missing ingredients in the understanding of Mercury's global thermal evolution. Slavin et al. (p. 665 , published online 15 July) report on magnetic field measurements made during the 29 September flyby, when Mercury's magnetosphere underwent extremely strong coupling with the solar wind. The planet's tail magnetic field increased and then decreased by factors of 2 to 3.5 during periods lasting 2 to 3 minutes. These observations suggest that magnetic open flux loads the magnetosphere, which is subsequently unloaded by substorms—magnetic disturbances during which energy is rapidly released in the magnetotail. At Earth, changes in tail magnetic field intensity during the loading/unloading cycle are much smaller and occur on much longer time scales. Vervack et al. (p. 672 , published online 15 July) used the Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer onboard MESSENGER to make measurements of Mercury's neutral and ion exospheres.

https://openalex.org/W2141218575,"Background Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 is the key transcriptional factor involved in the adaptation process of cells and organisms to hypoxia. Recent findings suggest that HIF-1 plays also a crucial role in inflammatory and infectious diseases. Methodology/Principal Findings Using patient skin biopsies, cell culture and murine infection models, HIF-1 activation was determined by immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting and reporter gene assays and was linked to cellular oxygen consumption. The course of a S. aureus peritonitis was determined upon pharmacological HIF-1 inhibition. Activation of HIF-1 was detectable (i) in all ex vivo in biopsies of patients suffering from skin infections, (ii) in vitro using cell culture infection models and (iii) in vivo using murine intravenous and peritoneal S. aureus infection models. HIF-1 activation by human pathogens was induced by oxygen-dependent mechanisms. Small colony variants (SCVs) of S. aureus known to cause chronic infections did not result in cellular hypoxia nor in HIF-1 activation. Pharmaceutical inhibition of HIF-1 activation resulted in increased survival rates of mice suffering from a S. aureus peritonitis. Conclusions/Significance Activation of HIF-1 is a general phenomenon in infections with human pathogenic bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. HIF-1-regulated pathways might be an attractive target to modulate the course of life-threatening infections."
https://openalex.org/W2039808373,"Aversive stressful experiences are typically associated with increased anxiety and a predisposition to develop mood disorders. Negative stress also suppresses adult neurogenesis and restricts dendritic architecture in the hippocampus, a brain region associated with anxiety regulation. The effects of aversive stress on hippocampal structure and function have been linked to stress-induced elevations in glucocorticoids. Normalizing corticosterone levels prevents some of the deleterious consequences of stress, including increased anxiety and suppressed structural plasticity in the hippocampus. Here we examined whether a rewarding stressor, namely sexual experience, also adversely affects hippocampal structure and function in adult rats. Adult male rats were exposed to a sexually-receptive female once (acute) or once daily for 14 consecutive days (chronic) and levels of circulating glucocorticoids were measured. Separate cohorts of sexually experienced rats were injected with the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine in order to measure cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. In addition, brains were processed using Golgi impregnation to assess the effects of sexual experience on dendritic spines and dendritic complexity in the hippocampus. Finally, to evaluate whether sexual experience alters hippocampal function, rats were tested on two tests of anxiety-like behavior: novelty suppressed feeding and the elevated plus maze. We found that acute sexual experience increased circulating corticosterone levels and the number of new neurons in the hippocampus. Chronic sexual experience no longer produced an increase in corticosterone levels but continued to promote adult neurogenesis and stimulate the growth of dendritic spines and dendritic architecture. Chronic sexual experience also reduced anxiety-like behavior. These findings suggest that a rewarding experience not only buffers against the deleterious actions of early elevated glucocorticoids but actually promotes neuronal growth and reduces anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W2018053926,"Conservation planners represent many aspects of biodiversity by using surrogates with spatial distributions readily observed or quantified, but tests of their effectiveness have produced varied and conflicting results. We identified four factors likely to have a strong influence on the apparent effectiveness of surrogates: (1) the choice of surrogate; (2) differences among study regions, which might be large and unquantified (3) the test method, that is, how effectiveness is quantified, and (4) the test features that the surrogates are intended to represent. Analysis of an unusually rich dataset enabled us, for the first time, to disentangle these factors and to compare their individual and interacting influences. Using two data-rich regions, we estimated effectiveness using five alternative methods: two forms of incidental representation, two forms of species accumulation index and irreplaceability correlation, to assess the performance of 'forest ecosystems' and 'environmental units' as surrogates for six groups of threatened species-the test features-mammals, birds, reptiles, frogs, plants and all of these combined. Four methods tested the effectiveness of the surrogates by selecting areas for conservation of the surrogates then estimating how effective those areas were at representing test features. One method measured the spatial match between conservation priorities for surrogates and test features. For methods that selected conservation areas, we measured effectiveness using two analytical approaches: (1) when representation targets for the surrogates were achieved (incidental representation), or (2) progressively as areas were selected (species accumulation index). We estimated the spatial correlation of conservation priorities using an index known as summed irreplaceability. In general, the effectiveness of surrogates for our taxa (mostly threatened species) was low, although environmental units tended to be more effective than forest ecosystems. The surrogates were most effective for plants and mammals and least effective for frogs and reptiles. The five testing methods differed in their rankings of effectiveness of the two surrogates in relation to different groups of test features. There were differences between study areas in terms of the effectiveness of surrogates for different test feature groups. Overall, the effectiveness of the surrogates was sensitive to all four factors. This indicates the need for caution in generalizing surrogacy tests."

We performed a population-based prospective study among the employees of Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company Ltd., Ningbo, China to investigate whether the elevation of serum uric acid has a casual role for NAFLD. A total of 6890 initially NAFLD-free subjects were followed up for 3 years. Overall, 11.80% (813/6890) subjects developed NAFLD over 3 years of follow-up. The cumulative incidence of NAFLD increased with progressively higher baseline serum uric acid levels (the cumulative incidence was 7.2%, 9.5%, 11.5%, 13.8%, and 17.2% in quintile 1, quintile 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively; P value for trend <0.001). Cox proportional hazards regression analyses showed that serum uric acid levels were independently and positively associated with the risk for incident NAFLD; the age-, gender- and metabolic syndrome adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI) for the subjects in quintile 2, 3, 4 and 5 versus quintile 1 was 1.18 (0.91–1.54), 1.32 (1.03–1.70), 1.39 (1.09–1.78) and 1.50 (1.18–1.92), respectively.

However, frequent inversions associated with palindromic sequences within this region have been found in multiple lineages of Angiosperms and may complicate its use as a barcode, especially if they occur within species.Here, we evaluate the implications of intraspecific inversions in the trnH-psbA region for DNA barcoding efforts. We report polymorphic inversions within six species of Gentianaceae, all narrowly circumscribed morphologically: Gentiana algida, Gentiana fremontii, Gentianopsis crinita, Gentianopsis thermalis, Gentianopsis macrantha and Frasera speciosa. We analyze these sequences together with those from 15 other species of Gentianaceae and show that typical simple methods of sequence alignment can lead to misassignment of conspecifics and incorrect assessment of relationships.Frequent inversions in the trnH-psbA region, if not recognized and aligned appropriately, may lead to large overestimates of the number of substitution events separating closely related lineages and to uniting more distantly related taxa that share the same form of the inversion. Thus, alignment of the trnH-psbA spacer region will need careful attention if it is used as a marker for DNA barcoding."
https://openalex.org/W2005440053,"""The enigma of soil animal species diversity"" was the title of a popular article by J. M. Anderson published in 1975. In that paper, Anderson provided insights on the great richness of species found in soils, but emphasized that the mechanisms contributing to the high species richness belowground were largely unknown. Yet, exploration of the mechanisms driving species richness has focused, almost exclusively, on above-ground plant and animal communities, and nearly 35 years later we have several new hypotheses but are not much closer to revealing why soils are so rich in species. One persistent but untested hypothesis is that species richness is promoted by small-scale environmental heterogeneity.To test this hypothesis we manipulated small-scale heterogeneity in soil properties in a one-year field experiment and investigated the impacts on the richness of soil fauna and evenness of the microbial communities. We found that heterogeneity substantially increased the species richness of oribatid mites, collembolans and nematodes, whereas heterogeneity had no direct influence on the evenness of either the fungal, bacterial or archaeal communities or on species richness of the large and mobile mesostigmatid mites. These results suggest that the heterogeneity-species richness relationship is scale dependent.Our results provide direct evidence for the hypothesis that small-scale heterogeneity in soils increase species richness of intermediate-sized soil fauna. The concordance of mechanisms between above and belowground communities suggests that the relationship between environmental heterogeneity and species richness may be a general property of ecological communities."

The current model for the role of Mitf in melanoma assumes that the total activity of the protein is tightly regulated in order to secure cell proliferation. Previous research has shown that regulation of Mitf is complex and involves regulation of expression, splicing, protein stability and post-translational modifications. Here we show that microRNAs (miRNAs) are also involved in regulating Mitf in melanoma cells. Sequence analysis revealed conserved binding sites for several miRNAs in the Mitf 3'UTR sequence. Furthermore, miR-148 was shown to affect Mitf mRNA expression in melanoma cells through a conserved binding site in the 3'UTR sequence of mouse and human Mitf. In addition we confirm the previously reported effects of miR-137 on Mitf. Other miRNAs, miR-27a, miR-32 and miR-124 which all have conserved binding sites in the Mitf 3'UTR sequence did not have effects on Mitf. Our data show that miR-148 and miR-137 present an additional level of regulating Mitf expression in melanocytes and melanoma cells. Loss of this regulation, either by mutations or by shortening of the 3'UTR sequence, is therefore a likely factor in melanoma formation and/or progression."

Hence, the objective of the present study was to assess the association between dietary factors and prospective changes in visceral adiposity as measured by changes in the phenotype WC(BMI).We analyzed data from 48,631 men and women from 5 countries participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Anthropometric measurements were obtained at baseline and after a median follow-up time of 5.5 years. WC(BMI) was defined as the residuals of waist circumference regressed on body mass index, and annual change in WC(BMI) (DeltaWC(BMI), cm/y) was defined as the difference between residuals at follow-up and baseline, divided by follow-up time. The association between energy, energy density (ED), macronutrients, alcohol, glycemic index (GI), glycemic load (GL), fibre and DeltaWC(BMI) was modelled using centre-specific adjusted linear regression, and random-effects meta-analyses to obtain pooled estimates. Men and women with higher ED and GI diets showed significant increases in their WC(BMI), compared to those with lower ED and GI [1 kcal/g greater ED predicted a DeltaWC(BMI) of 0.09 cm (95% CI 0.05 to 0.13) in men and 0.15 cm (95% CI 0.09 to 0.21) in women; 10 units greater GI predicted a DeltaWC(BMI) of 0.07 cm (95% CI 0.03 to 0.12) in men and 0.06 cm (95% CI 0.03 to 0.10) in women]. Among women, lower fibre intake, higher GL, and higher alcohol consumption also predicted a higher DeltaWC(BMI).Results of this study suggest that a diet with low GI and ED may prevent visceral adiposity, defined as the prospective changes in WC(BMI). Additional effects may be obtained among women of low alcohol, low GL, and high fibre intake."

We demonstrate that temporal and spatial distribution of copper in hepatocytes may play an important role in WD pathology. High resolution synchrotron-based x-ray fluorescence imaging in situ indicates that copper does not continuously accumulate in Atp7b(-/-) hepatocytes, but reaches a limit at 90-300 fmol. The lack of further accumulation is associated with the loss of copper transporter Ctr1 from the plasma membrane and the appearance of copper-loaded lymphocytes and extracellular copper deposits. The WD progression is characterized by changes in subcellular copper localization and transcriptome remodeling. The synchrotron-based x-ray fluorescence imaging and mRNA profiling both point to the key role of nucleus in the initial response to copper overload and suggest time-dependent sequestration of copper in deposits as a protective mechanism. The metabolic pathways, up-regulated in response to copper, show compartmentalization that parallels changes in subcellular copper concentration. In contrast, significant down-regulation of lipid metabolism is observed at all stages of WD irrespective of copper distribution. These observations suggest new stage-specific as well as general biomarkers for WD. The model for the dynamic role of copper in WD is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2013947852,"In April 2009, a new pandemic strain of influenza infected thousands of persons in Mexico and the United States and spread rapidly worldwide. During the ensuing summer months, cases ebbed in the Northern Hemisphere while the Southern Hemisphere experienced a typical influenza season dominated by the novel strain. In the fall, a second wave of pandemic H1N1 swept through the United States, peaking in most parts of the country by mid October and returning to baseline levels by early December. The objective was to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies against the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza strain by decade of birth among Pittsburgh-area residents.Anonymous blood samples were obtained from clinical laboratories and categorized by decade of birth from 1920-2009. Using hemagglutination-inhibition assays, approximately 100 samples per decade (n = 846) were tested from blood samples drawn on hospital and clinic patients in mid-November and early December 2009. Age specific seroprevalences against pandemic H1N1 (A/California/7/2009) were measured and compared to seroprevalences against H1N1 strains that had previously circulated in the population in 2007, 1957, and 1918. (A/Brisbane/59/2007, A/Denver/1/1957, and A/South Carolina/1/1918). Stored serum samples from healthy, young adults from 2008 were used as a control group (n = 100). Seroprevalences against pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza varied by age group, with children age 10-19 years having the highest seroprevalence (45%), and persons age 70-79 years having the lowest (5%). The baseline seroprevalence among control samples from 18-24 year-olds was 6%. Overall seroprevalence against pandemic H1N1 across all age groups was approximately 21%.After the peak of the second wave of 2009 H1N1, HAI seroprevalence results suggest that 21% of persons in the Pittsburgh area had become infected and developed immunity. Extrapolating to the entire US population, we estimate that at least 63 million persons became infected in 2009. As was observed among clinical cases, this sero-epidemiological study revealed highest infection rates among school-age children."
https://openalex.org/W2061869088,"Background The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) is an endocytic receptor mediating the clearance of various extracellular molecules involved in the dissemination of cancer cells. LRP-1 thus appeared as an attractive receptor for targeting the invasive behavior of malignant cells. However, recent results suggest that LRP-1 may facilitate the development and growth of cancer metastases in vivo, but the precise contribution of the receptor during cancer progression remains to be elucidated. The lack of mechanistic insights into the intracellular signaling networks downstream of LRP-1 has prevented the understanding of its contribution towards cancer. Methodology/Principal Findings Through a short-hairpin RNA-mediated silencing approach, we identified LRP-1 as a main regulator of ERK and JNK signaling in a tumor cell context. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that LRP-1 constitutes an intracellular docking site for MAPK containing complexes. By using pharmacological agents, constitutively active and dominant-negative kinases, we demonstrated that LRP-1 maintains malignant cells in an adhesive state that is favorable for invasion by activating ERK and inhibiting JNK. We further demonstrated that the LRP-1-dependent regulation of MAPK signaling organizes the cytoskeletal architecture and mediates adhesive complex turnover in cancer cells. Moreover, we found that LRP-1 is tethered to the actin network and to focal adhesion sites and controls ERK and JNK targeting to talin-rich structures. Conclusions We identified ERK and JNK as the main molecular relays by which LRP-1 regulates focal adhesion disassembly of malignant cells to support invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2045595833,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma has a striking tendency to migrate and metastasize. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, the inducible isoform of prostaglandin (PG) synthase, has been implicated in tumor metastasis. However, the effects of COX-2 on human oral cancer cells are largely unknown. We found that overexpression of COX-2 or exogenous PGE(2) increased migration and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM)-1 expression in human oral cancer cells. Using pharmacological inhibitors, activators, and genetic inhibition of EP receptors, we discovered that the EP1 receptor, but not other PGE receptors, is involved in PGE(2)-mediated cell migration and ICAM-1 expression. PGE(2)-mediated migration and ICAM-1 up-regulation were attenuated by inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC)δ, and c-Src. Activation of the PKCδ, c-Src, and AP-1 signaling pathway occurred after PGE(2) treatment. PGE(2)-induced expression of ICAM-1 and migration activity were inhibited by a specific inhibitor, siRNA, and mutants of PKCδ, c-Src, and AP-1. In addition, migration-prone sublines demonstrated that cells with increased migration ability had higher expression of COX-2 and ICAM-1. Taken together, these results indicate that the PGE(2) and EP1 interaction enhanced migration of oral cancer cells through an increase in ICAM-1 production."
https://openalex.org/W1991750390,"Traps baited with synthetic human odors have been proposed as suitable technologies for controlling malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases. We investigated the potential benefits of such traps for preventing malaria transmission in Africa and the essential characteristics that they should possess so as to be effective.An existing mathematical model was reformulated to distinguish availability of hosts for attack by mosquitoes from availability of blood per se. This adaptation allowed the effects of pseudo-hosts such as odor-baited mosquito traps, which do not yield blood but which can nonetheless be attacked by the mosquitoes, to be simulated considering communities consisting of users and non-users of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), currently the primary malaria prevention method. We determined that malaria transmission declines as trap coverage (proportion of total availability of all hosts and pseudo hosts that traps constitute) increases. If the traps are more attractive than humans and are located in areas where mosquitoes are most abundant, 20-130 traps per 1000 people would be sufficient to match the impact of 50% community-wide ITN coverage. If such traps are used to complement ITNs, malaria transmission can be reduced by 99% or more in most scenarios representative of Africa. However, to match cost-effectiveness of ITNs, the traps delivery, operation and maintenance would have to cost a maximum of US$4.25 to 27.61 per unit per year.Odor-baited mosquito traps might potentially be effective and affordable tools for malaria control in Africa, particularly if they are used to complement, rather than replace, existing methods. We recommend that developers should focus on super-attractive baits and cheaper traps to enhance cost-effectiveness, and that the most appropriate way to deploy such technologies is through vertical delivery mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2083167859,"Protein kinases are potential targets for the prevention and control of UV-induced skin cancer. T-cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) is highly expressed in skin cancer cells, but its specific function is still unknown. We investigated the role of TOPK in UVB-induced apoptosis in RPMI7951 human melanoma cells. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis was used to identify proteins that bind with TOPK. Immunofluorescence, Western blot, and flow cytometry were used to assess the effect of UVB on TOPK, peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1), and apoptosis in RPMI7951 cells. TOPK binds with Prx1 and its phosphorylation of Prx1 at Ser-32 is important for regulation of H(2)O(2)-mediated signal transduction. Analysis of the CD spectra of Prx1 and mutant Prx1 (S32A) proteins showed that the secondary structure of Prx1 was significantly altered by phosphorylation of Prx1 at Ser-32. UVB irradiation induced phosphorylation of TOPK in RPMI7951 human melanoma cells and phosphorylated TOPK co-localized with Prx1 in the nucleus. UVB induced the peroxidase activity of Prx1 in vitro and ex vivo. Following treatment with UVB, H(2)O(2) levels and apoptosis were increased in RPMI7951 cells stably expressing TOPK siRNA or stably mutant Prx1 (S32A). Phosphorylation of Prx1 (Ser-32) by TOPK prevents UVB-induced apoptosis in RPMI7951 melanoma cells through regulation of Prx1 peroxidase activity and blockade of intracellular H(2)O(2) accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2084117379,"Background Obligate intracellular bacteria of arthropods often exhibit a significant role in either human health or arthropod ecology. Methodology/Principal Findings An obligate intracellular gamma-proteobacterium was isolated from the actively questing hard tick Ixodes ricinus using mammalian and amphibian cell lines. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a unique morphology of the bacterium, including intravacuolar localization of bacteria grouped predominantly in pairs and internal structures composed of electron-dense crystal-like structures and regular multilayer sheath-like structures. The isolate 20B was characterized to determine its taxonomic position using a polyphasic approach. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that this strain belongs to the family Coxiellaceae, order Legionellales of Gamma-proteobacteria, and the closest relatives are different Rickettsiella spp. The level of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strain 20B and other recognized species of the family was below 94.5%. Partial sequences of the rpoB, parC and ftsY genes confirmed the phylogenetic position of the new isolate. The G+C content estimated on the basis of whole genome analysis of strain 20B was 37.88%. On the basis of its phenotypic and genotypic properties, together with phylogenetic distinctiveness, we propose that strain 20B to be classified in the new genus Diplorickettsia as the type strain of a novel species named Diplorickettsia massiliensis sp. nov. Conclusions/Significance Considering the source of its isolation (hard tick, often biting humans) the role of this bacterium in the pathology of humans, animals and ticks should be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2095371103,"Background Mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane-conductance regulator (CFTR) causes cystic fibrosis (CF) but not all CF aspects can easily be explained by deficient ion transport. CF-inflammation provides one example but its pathogenesis remains controversial. Here, we tested the simple but fundamental hypothesis that wild-type CFTR is needed to suppress NF-κB activity. Methodology/Principal Findings In lung epithelial (H441) and engineered (H57) cell lines; we report that inflammatory markers are significantly suppressed by wild-type CFTR. Transient-transfection of wild-type CFTR into CFTR-naïve H441 cells, dose-dependently down-regulates both basal and Tumour Necrosis Factor-α evoked NF-κB activity when compared to transfection with empty vector alone (p<0.01, n>5). This effect was also observed in CFTR-naïve H57-HeLa cells which stably express a reporter of NF-κB activity, confirming that the CFTR-mediated repression of inflammation was not due to variable reporter gene transfection efficiency. In contrast, H57 cells transfected with a control cyano-fluorescent protein show a significantly elevated basal level of NF-κB activity above control. Initial cell seeding density may be a critical factor in mediating the suppressive effects of CFTR on inflammation as only at a certain density (1×105 cells/well) did we observe the reduction in NF-κB activity. CFTR channel activity may be necessary for this suppression because the CFTR specific inhibitor CFTRinh172 significantly stimulates NF-κB activity by ∼30% in CFTR expressing 16HBE14o− cells whereas pharmacological elevation of cyclic-AMP depresses activity by ∼25% below baseline. Conclusions/Significance These data indicate that CFTR has inherent anti-inflammatory properties. We propose that the hyper-inflammation found in CF may arise as a consequence of disrupted repression of NF-κB signalling which is normally mediated by CFTR. Our data therefore concur with in vivo and in vitro data from Vij and colleagues which highlights CFTR as a suppressor of basal inflammation acting through NF-κB, a central hub in inflammatory signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2097229100,"Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) agonistic screams are graded vocal signals that are produced in a context-specific manner. Screams given by aggressors and victims can be discriminated based on their acoustic structure but the mechanisms of listener comprehension of these calls are currently unknown. In this study, we show that chimpanzees extract social information from these vocal signals that, combined with their more general social knowledge, enables them to understand the nature of out-of-sight social interactions. In playback experiments, we broadcast congruent and incongruent sequences of agonistic calls and monitored the response of bystanders. Congruent sequences were in accordance with existing social dominance relations; incongruent ones violated them. Subjects looked significantly longer at incongruent sequences, despite them being acoustically less salient (fewer call types from fewer individuals) than congruent ones. We concluded that chimpanzees categorised an apparently simple acoustic signal into victim and aggressor screams and used pragmatics to form inferences about third-party interactions they could not see."
https://openalex.org/W1976401235,"Background Plumage coloration is important for bird communication, most notably in sexual signalling. Colour is often considered a good quality indicator, and the expression of exaggerated colours may depend on individual condition during moult. After moult, plumage coloration has been deemed fixed due to the fact that feathers are dead structures. Still, many plumage colours change after moult, although whether this affects signalling has not been sufficiently assessed. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied changes in coloration after moult in four passerine birds (robin, Erithacus rubecula; blackbird, Turdus merula; blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus; and great tit, Parus major) displaying various coloration types (melanin-, carotenoid-based and structural). Birds were caught regularly during three years to measure plumage reflectance. We used models of avian colour vision to derive two variables, one describing chromatic and the other achromatic variation over the year that can be compared in magnitude among different colour types. All studied plumage patches but one (yellow breast of the blue tit) showed significant chromatic changes over the year, although these were smaller than for a typical dynamic trait (bill colour). Overall, structural colours showed a reduction in relative reflectance at shorter wavelengths, carotenoid-based colours the opposite pattern, while no general pattern was found for melanin-based colours. Achromatic changes were also common, but there were no consistent patterns of change for the different types of colours. Conclusions/Significance Changes of plumage coloration independent of moult are probably widespread; they should be perceivable by birds and have the potential to affect colour signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2072391062,"It is now believed that the allosteric modulation produced by ethanol in glycine receptors (GlyRs) depends on alcohol binding to discrete sites within the protein structure. Thus, the differential ethanol sensitivity of diverse GlyR isoforms and mutants was explained by the presence of specific residues in putative alcohol pockets. Here, we demonstrate that ethanol sensitivity in two ligand-gated ion receptor members, the GlyR adult α(1) and embryonic α(2) subunits, can be modified through selective mutations that rescued or impaired Gβγ modulation. Even though both isoforms were able to physically interact with Gβγ, only the α(1) GlyR was functionally modulated by Gβγ and pharmacological ethanol concentrations. Remarkably, the simultaneous switching of two transmembrane and a single extracellular residue in α(2) GlyRs was enough to generate GlyRs modulated by Gβγ and low ethanol concentrations. Interestingly, although we found that these TM residues were different to those in the alcohol binding site, the extracellular residue was recently implicated in conformational changes important to generate a pre-open-activated state that precedes ion channel gating. Thus, these results support the idea that the differential ethanol sensitivity of these two GlyR isoforms rests on conformational changes in transmembrane and extracellular residues within the ion channel structure rather than in differences in alcohol binding pockets. Our results describe the molecular basis for the differential ethanol sensitivity of two ligand-gated ion receptor members based on selective Gβγ modulation and provide a new mechanistic framework for allosteric modulations of abuse drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1987330788,"Background Exertional rhabdomyolysis syndrome is recognised in many athletic horse breeds and in recent years specific forms of the syndrome have been identified. However, although Standardbred horses are used worldwide for racing, there is a paucity of information about the epidemiological and performance-related aspects of the syndrome in this breed. The objectives of this study therefore were to determine the incidence, risk factors and performance effects of exertional rhabdomyolysis syndrome in Standardbred trotters and to compare the epidemiology and genetics of the syndrome with that in other breeds. Methodology/Principal Findings A questionnaire-based case-control study (with analysis of online race records) was conducted following identification of horses that were determined susceptible to exertional rhabdomyolysis (based on serum biochemistry) from a total of 683 horses in 22 yards. Thirty six exertional rhabdomyolysis-susceptible horses were subsequently genotyped for the skeletal muscle glycogen synthase (GYS1) mutation responsible for type 1 polysaccharide storage myopathy. A total of 44 susceptible horses was reported, resulting in an annual incidence of 6.4 (95% CI 4.6–8.2%) per 100 horses. Female horses were at significantly greater risk than males (odds ratio 7.1; 95% CI 2.1–23.4; p = 0.001) and nervous horses were at a greater risk than horses with calm or average temperaments (odds ratio 7.9; 95% CI 2.3–27.0; p = 0.001). Rhabdomyolysis-susceptible cases performed better from standstill starts (p = 0.04) than controls and had a higher percentage of wins (p = 0.006). All exertional rhabdomyolysis-susceptible horses tested were negative for the R309H GYS1 mutation. Conclusions/Significance Exertional rhabdomyolysis syndrome in Standardbred horses has a similar incidence and risk factors to the syndrome in Thoroughbred horses. If the disorder has a genetic basis in Standardbreds, improved performance in susceptible animals may be responsible for maintenance of the disorder in the population."

Here, we show that p180 plays a key role in procollagen biosynthesis and secretion in diploid fibroblasts. Depletion of p180 caused marked reductions of secreted collagens without significant loss of the ER membrane or mRNA. Metabolic labeling experiments revealed that the procollagen biosynthetic activity was markedly affected following p180 depletion. Moreover, loss of p180 perturbs ascorbate-stimulated de novo biosynthesis mainly in the membrane fraction with a preferential secretion defect of large proteins. At the EM level, one of the most prominent morphological features of p180-depleted cells was insufficient ribosome association on the ER membranes. In contrast, the ER of control cells was studded with numerous ribosomes, which were further enhanced by ascorbate. Similarly biochemical analysis confirmed that levels of membrane-bound ribosomes were altered in a p180-dependent manner. Taken together, our data suggest that p180 plays crucial roles in enhancing collagen biosynthesis at the entry site of the secretory compartments by a novel mechanism that mainly involves facilitating ribosome association on the ER.

https://openalex.org/W2101585695,"Background The p53 homologs, p63 and p73, share ∼85% amino acid identity in their DNA-binding domains, but they have distinct biological functions. Principal Findings Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-resolution tiling arrays covering the human genome, we identify p73 DNA binding sites on a genome-wide level in ME180 human cervical carcinoma cells. Strikingly, the p73 binding profile is indistinguishable from the previously described binding profile for p63 in the same cells. Moreover, the p73∶p63 binding ratio is similar at all genomic loci tested, suggesting that there are few, if any, targets that are specific for one of these factors. As assayed by sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation, p63 and p73 co-occupy DNA target sites in vivo, suggesting that p63 and p73 bind primarily as heterotetrameric complexes in ME180 cells. Conclusions The observation that p63 and p73 associate with the same genomic targets suggest that their distinct biological functions are due to cell-type specific expression and/or protein domains that involve functions other than DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W2005198909,"Background: How to extract useful information from complex biological networks is a major goal in many fields, especially in genomics and proteomics. We have shown in several works that iterative hierarchical clustering, as implemented in the UVCluster program, is a powerful tool to analyze many of those networks. However, the amount of computation time required to perform UVCluster analyses imposed significant limitations to its use. Methodology/Principal Findings: We describe the suite Jerarca, designed to efficiently convert networks of interacting units into dendrograms by means of iterative hierarchical clustering. Jerarca is divided into three main sections. First, weighted distances among units are computed using up to three different approaches: a more efficient version of UVCluster and two new, related algorithms called RCluster and SCluster. Second, Jerarca builds dendrograms based on those distances, using well-known phylogenetic algorithms, such as UPGMA or Neighbor-Joining. Finally, Jerarca provides optimal partitions of the trees using statistical criteria based on the distribution of intra- and intercluster connections. Outputs compatible with the phylogenetic software MEGA and the Cytoscape package are generated, allowing the results to be easily visualized. Conclusions/Significance: The four main advantages of Jerarca in respect to UVCluster are: 1) Improved speed of a novel UVCluster algorithm; 2) Additional, alternative strategies to perform iterative hierarchical clustering; 3) Automatic evaluation of the hierarchical trees to obtain optimal partitions; and, 4) Outputs compatible with popular software such as MEGA and Cytoscape."
https://openalex.org/W2023847294,"Phosphoinositide phospholipase C (PI-PLC) plays an essential role in cell signaling. A unique Trypanosoma cruzi PI-PLC (TcPI-PLC) is lipid-modified in its N terminus and localizes to the plasma membrane of amastigotes. Here, we show that TcPI-PLC is located onto the extracellular phase of the plasma membrane of amastigotes and that its N-terminal 20 amino acids are necessary and sufficient to target the fused GFP to the outer surface of the parasite. Mutagenesis of the predicted acylated residues confirmed that myristoylation of a glycine residue in the 2nd position and acyl modification of a cysteine in the 4th but not in the 8th or 15th position of the coding sequence are required for correct plasma membrane localization in T. cruzi epimastigotes or amastigotes. Interestingly, mutagenesis of the cysteine at the 8th position increased its flagellar localization. When expressed as fusion constructs with GFP, the N-terminal 6 and 10 amino acids fused to GFP are predominantly located in the cytosol and concentrated in a compartment that co-localizes with a Golgi complex marker. The N-terminal 20 amino acids of TcPI-PLC associate with lipid rafts when dually acylated. Taken together, these results indicate that N-terminal acyl modifications serve as a molecular addressing system for sending TcPI-PLC to the outer surface of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2117056988,"Background The cytoskeletal adaptor protein vinculin plays a fundamental role in cell contact regulation and affects central aspects of cell motility, which are essential to both embryonal development and tissue homeostasis. Functional regulation of this evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed protein is dominated by a high-affinity, autoinhibitory head-to-tail interaction that spatially restricts ligand interactions to cell adhesion sites and, furthermore, limits the residency time of vinculin at these sites. To date, no mutants of the vinculin protein have been characterized in animal models. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we investigate vinculin-ΔEx20, a splice variant of the protein lacking the 68 amino acids encoded by exon 20 of the vinculin gene VCL. Vinculin-ΔEx20 was found to be expressed alongside with wild type protein in a knock-in mouse model with a deletion of introns 20 and 21 (VCL-ΔIn20/21 allele) and shows defective head-to-tail interaction. Homozygous VCL-ΔIn20/21 embryos die around embryonal day E12.5 showing cranial neural tube defects and exencephaly. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts and upon ectopic expression, vinculin-ΔEx20 reveals characteristics of constitutive head binding activity. Interestingly, the impact of vinculin-ΔEx20 on cell contact induction and stabilization, a hallmark of the vinculin head domain, is only moderate, thus allowing invasion and motility of cells in three-dimensional collagen matrices. Lacking both F-actin interaction sites of the tail, the vinculin-ΔEx20 variant unveils vinculin's dynamic binding to cell adhesions independent of a cytoskeletal association, and thus differs from head-to-tail binding deficient mutants such as vinculin-T12, in which activated F-actin binding locks the protein variant to cell contact sites. Conclusions/Significance Vinculin-ΔEx20 is an active variant supporting adhesion site stabilization without an enhanced mechanical coupling. Its presence in a transgenic animal reveals the potential of splice variants in the vinculin gene to alter vinculin function in vivo. Correct control of vinculin is necessary for embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W2138058910,"Background It is known that genetic predisposition to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with the MHC class II allele HLA-DR4 and that residues 261–273 of type II collagen (huCollp261) represent an immunodominant T cell epitope restricted by the DR4 molecule. Despite recent advances in characterization of MHC and T cell receptor (TCR) contacts to this epitope, the atomic details of TCR/huCollp261/HLA-DR4 ternary complex are not known. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we have used computational modeling to get insight into this interaction. A three-dimensional model of the TCR Vβ domain from a DR4+ patient affected by RA has been derived by homology modeling techniques. Subsequently, the structure of the TCR Vβ domain in complex with huCollp261/HLA-DR4 was obtained from a docking approach in conjunction with a filtering procedure based on biochemical information. The best complex from the docking experiments was then refined by 20 ns of molecular dynamics simulation in explicit water. The predicted model is consistent with available experimental data. Our results indicate that residues 97–101 of CDR3β are critical for recognition of huCollp261/HLA-DR4 by TCR. We also show that TCR contacts on p/MHC surface affect the conformation of the shared epitope expressed by DR alleles associated with RA susceptibility. Conclusions/Significance This work presents a three-dimensional model for the ternary complex TCR-Vβ/collagenII(261–273)/HLA-DR4 associated with rheumatoid arthritis that can provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of self reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2154216224,"Background Thymocyte expressed molecule involved in selection 1 (Themis1, SwissProt accession number Q8BGW0) is the recently characterised founder member of a novel family of proteins. A second member of this family, Themis2 (Q91YX0), also known as ICB1 (Induced on contact with basement membrane 1), remains unreported at the protein level despite microarray and EST databases reporting Themis2 mRNA expression in B cells and macrophages. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we characterise Themis2 protein for the first time and show that it acts as a macrophage signalling scaffold, exerting a receptor-, mediator- and signalling pathway-specific effect on TLR responses in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Themis2 over-expression enhanced the LPS-induced production of TNF but not IL-6 or Cox-2, nor TNF production induced by ligands for TLR2 (PAM3) or TLR3 (poly I∶C). Moreover, LPS-induced activation of the MAP kinases ERK and p38 was enhanced in cells over-expressing Themis2 whereas the activation of JNK, IRF3 or NF-κB p65, was unaffected. Depletion of Themis2 protein by RNA inteference inhibited LPS-induced TNF production in primary human macrophages demonstrating a requirement for Themis2 in this event. Themis2 was inducibly tyrosine phosphorylated upon LPS challenge and interacted with Lyn kinase (P25911), the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Vav (P27870), and the adaptor protein Grb2 (Q60631). Mutation of either tyrosine 660 or a proline-rich sequence (PPPRPPK) simultaneously interrupted this complex and reduced by approximately 50% the capacity of Themis2 to promote LPS-induced TNF production. Finally, Themis2 protein expression was induced during macrophage development from murine bone marrow precursors and was regulated by inflammatory stimuli both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions/Significance We hypothesise that Themis2 may constitute a novel, physiological control point in macrophage inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W2000431425,"Containing an epidemic at its origin is the most desirable mitigation. Epidemics have often originated in rural areas, with rural communities among the first affected. Disease dynamics in rural regions have received limited attention, and results of general studies cannot be directly applied since population densities and human mobility factors are very different in rural regions from those in cities. We create a network model of a rural community in Kansas, USA, by collecting data on the contact patterns and computing rates of contact among a sampled population. We model the impact of different mitigation strategies detecting closely connected groups of people and frequently visited locations. Within those groups and locations, we compare the effectiveness of random and targeted vaccinations using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered compartmental model on the contact network. Our simulations show that the targeted vaccinations of only 10% of the sampled population reduced the size of the epidemic by 34.5%. Additionally, if 10% of the population visiting one of the most popular locations is randomly vaccinated, the epidemic size is reduced by 19%. Our results suggest a new implementation of a highly effective strategy for targeted vaccinations through the use of popular locations in rural communities."
https://openalex.org/W2035362370,"RBR ubiquitin ligases are components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system present in all eukaryotes. They are characterized by having the RBR (RING - IBR - RING) supradomain. In this study, the patterns of emergence of RBR genes in plants are described.Phylogenetic and structural data confirm that just four RBR subfamilies (Ariadne, ARA54, Plant I/Helicase and Plant II) exist in viridiplantae. All of them originated before the split that separated green algae from the rest of plants. Multiple genes of two of these subfamilies (Ariadne and Plant II) appeared in early plant evolution. It is deduced that the common ancestor of all plants contained at least five RBR genes and the available data suggest that this number has been increasing slowly along streptophyta evolution, although losses, especially of Helicase RBR genes, have also occurred in several lineages. Some higher plants (e. g. Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa) contain a very large number of RBR genes and many of them were recently generated by tandem duplications. Microarray data indicate that most of these new genes have low-level and sometimes specific expression patterns. On the contrary, and as occurs in animals, a small set of older genes are broadly expressed at higher levels.The available data suggests that the dynamics of appearance and conservation of RBR genes is quite different in plants from what has been described in animals. In animals, an abrupt emergence of many structurally diverse RBR subfamilies in early animal history, followed by losses of multiple genes in particular lineages, occurred. These patterns are not observed in plants. It is also shown that while both plants and animals contain a small, similar set of essential RBR genes, the rest evolves differently. The functional implications of these results are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2071185126,"Fluorescent proteins (FP) homologous to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria have revolutionized biomedical research due to their usefulness as genetically encoded fluorescent labels. Fluorescent proteins from copepods are particularly promising due to their high brightness and rapid fluorescence development.Here we report two novel FPs from Pontella mimocerami (Copepoda, Calanoida, Pontellidae), which were identified via fluorescence screening of a bacterial cDNA expression library prepared from the whole-body total RNA of the animal. The proteins are very similar in sequence and spectroscopic properties. They possess high molar extinction coefficients (79,000 M(-1) cm(-)) and quantum yields (0.92), which make them more than two-fold brighter than the most common FP marker, EGFP. Both proteins form oligomers, which we were able to counteract to some extent by mutagenesis of the N-terminal region; however, this particular modification resulted in substantial drop in brightness.The spectroscopic characteristics of the two P. mimocerami proteins place them among the brightest green FPs ever described. These proteins may therefore become valuable additions to the in vivo imaging toolkit."
https://openalex.org/W2080109366,"Background Pulmonary inflammation is a major contributor to morbidity in a variety of respiratory disorders, but treatment options are limited. Here we investigate the efficacy, safety and mechanism of action of low dose inhaled carbon monoxide (CO) using a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pulmonary inflammation. Methodology Mice were exposed to 0–500 ppm inhaled CO for periods of up to 24 hours prior to and following intratracheal instillation of 10 ng LPS. Animals were sacrificed and assessed for intraalveolar neutrophil influx and cytokine levels, flow cytometric determination of neutrophil number and activation in blood, lung and lavage fluid samples, or neutrophil mobilisation from bone marrow. Principal Findings When administered for 24 hours both before and after LPS, inhaled CO of 100 ppm or more reduced intraalveolar neutrophil infiltration by 40–50%, although doses above 100 ppm were associated with either high carboxyhemoglobin, weight loss or reduced physical activity. This anti-inflammatory effect of CO did not require pre-exposure before induction of injury. 100 ppm CO exposure attenuated neutrophil sequestration within the pulmonary vasculature as well as LPS-induced neutrophilia at 6 hours after LPS, likely due to abrogation of neutrophil mobilisation from bone marrow. In contrast to such apparently beneficial effects, 100 ppm inhaled CO induced an increase in pulmonary barrier permeability as determined by lavage fluid protein content and translocation of labelled albumin from blood to the alveolar space. Conclusions Overall, these data confirm some protective role for inhaled CO during pulmonary inflammation, although this required a dose that produced carboxyhemoglobin values close to potentially toxic levels for humans, and increased lung permeability."
https://openalex.org/W2121825082,"Despite the fact that genetic imprinting, i.e., differential expression of the same allele due to its different parental origins, plays a pivotal role in controlling complex traits or diseases, the origin, action and transmission mode of imprinted genes have still remained largely unexplored. We present a new strategy for studying these properties of genetic imprinting with a two-stage reciprocal F mating design, initiated with two contrasting inbred lines. This strategy maps quantitative trait loci that are imprinted (i.e., iQTLs) based on their segregation and transmission across different generations. By incorporating the allelic configuration of an iQTL genotype into a mixture model framework, this strategy provides a path to trace the parental origin of alleles from previous generations. The imprinting effects of iQTLs and their interactions with other traditionally defined genetic effects, expressed in different generations, are estimated and tested by implementing the EM algorithm. The strategy was used to map iQTLs responsible for survival time with four reciprocal F populations and test whether and how the detected iQTLs inherit their imprinting effects into the next generation. The new strategy will provide a tool for quantifying the role of imprinting effects in the creation and maintenance of phenotypic diversity and elucidating a comprehensive picture of the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2091774066,"Background Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) are important signaling molecules for a variety of pro-atherogenic cytokines including CD40L, TNF α, and IL1β. Several lines of evidence identified TRAF6 as a pro-inflammatory signaling molecule in vitro and we previously demonstrated overexpression of TRAF6 in human and Murine atherosclerotic plaques. This study investigated the role of TRAF6-deficiency in mice developing atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease. Methodology/Principal Findings Lethally irradiated low density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice (TRAF6+/+/LDLR−/−) were reconstituted with TRAF6-deficient fetal liver cells (FLC) and consumed high cholesterol diet for 18 weeks to assess the relevance of TRAF6 in hematopoietic cells for atherogenesis. Additionally, TRAF6+/−/LDLR−/− mice received TRAF6-deficient FLC to gain insight into the role of TRAF6 deficiency in resident cells. Surprisingly, atherosclerotic lesion size did not differ between the three groups in both aortic roots and abdominal aortas. Similarly, no significant differences in plaque composition could be observed as assessed by immunohistochemistry for macrophages, lipids, smooth muscle cells, T-cells, and collagen. In accord, in a small clinical study TRAF6/GAPDH total blood RNA ratios did not differ between groups of patients with stable coronary heart disease (0.034±0.0021, N = 178), acute coronary heart disease (0.029±0.0027, N = 70), and those without coronary heart disease (0.032±0.0016, N = 77) as assessed by angiography. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that TRAF6 is not required for atherogenesis in mice and does not associate with clinical disease in humans. These data suggest that pro- and anti-inflammatory features of TRAF6 signaling outweigh each other in the context of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2121637966,"Studies on insect melanism have greatly contributed to our understanding of natural selection and the ultimate factors influencing the evolution of darkly pigmented phenotypes. Research on several species of melanic lepidopteran larvae have found that low levels of circulating juvenile hormone (JH) titers are associated with a melanic phenotype, suggesting that genetic changes in the JH biosynthetic pathway give rise to increased deposition of melanin granules in the cuticle in this group. But does melanism arise through different molecular mechanisms in different species? The present study reports on a Bicyclus anynana (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) dark larvae single locus mutation, in which larvae exhibit a darker cuticle relative to wild type. Unlike other lepidopteran melanic larvae mutations, this one is autosomal recessive and does not appear to involve a deficiency in JH titers. Unlike JH deficiency mutants, dark larvae mutants display similar growth rates and sexual behaviors as wild type, and topical application of a JH analogue failed to rescue the wild type cuticular coloration. Finally, transmission electron microscopy showed that sclerotization or deposition of diffuse melanin, rather than deposition of melanin granules, produces the dark coloration found in the cuticle of this species. We conclude that different molecular mechanisms underlie larval melanism in different species of Lepidoptera."
https://openalex.org/W2069968626,"The MYCC (c-MYC) gene is amplified in 30–60% of human ovarian cancers. We assessed the functional significance of MYCC amplification by siRNA inhibition of MYCC or MYC paralogs in a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines expressing varying levels of MYCC. Inactivation of MYCC inhibited cell proliferation and induced replicative senescence only in lines with amplified MYCC, indicating that these cells are addicted to continued MYCC overexpression. In contrast, siRNA knockdown of all three MYC isoforms inhibited proliferation of MYCC non-amplified ovarian cancer cells without inducing replicative senescence, and did not inhibit the proliferation of telomerase-immortalized ovarian surface epithelial cells. The arrest induced by MYCC knockdown was accompanied by an increase in the level of the Cdk inhibitor p27Kip1 and a decrease in cyclin A expression and Cdk2 activity, and could be reversed by RNAi knockdown of p27Kip1 or Rb, or by overexpression of cyclin A/Cdk2. The arrest induced by knockdown of all three MYC isoforms could similarly be reversed by p27Kip1 knockdown. Our findings indicate that the addiction of MYCC-amplified ovarian cancer cells to MYCC differs from the dependence of MYCC non-amplified cancer cells on MYC paralogs, but both are mediated, at least in part, by p27Kip1.

They also suggest that growth of ovarian cancers may be blocked by inhibition of MYCC or MYC paralogs. One of the most common recurrent amplifications in cancer is the amplification of chromosomal region 8q24, which contains the oncogene MYCC (also referred to as MYC or c-MYC). 2The abbreviations used are:MYCCc-MYCCdkcyclin-dependent kinaseTIOSEtelomerase-immortalized ovarian surface epithelial cellsDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleSAsenescence-associatedSA-β-galsenescence-associated β-galactosidaseH3K9melysine-9 trimethylated histone H3MTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. In mammals, there are four related genes in the MYC family, MYCC, the prototype member of the family, MYCN (N-myc), MYCL (L-myc), and s-myc. Of the MYC genes, MYCC, MYCN, and MYCL have been implicated in the genesis of specific human tumors. In all cases, the amount of Myc protein is increased in the tumor tissue when compared with the surrounding normal tissues, suggesting that the elevated expression of Myc contributes to tumorigenesis (1Pelengaris S.

Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Experiments with transgenic mice inducibly expressing the MYCC oncogene have shown that repression of MYCC expression following the induction of tumor formation can lead to tumor regression, differentiation, replicative senescence, or apoptosis (3Arvanitis C. Felsher D.W. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2006; 16: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Such dependence of cancer cells on continued oncogene expression for proliferation or survival is frequently referred to as “oncogene addiction” (4Weinstein I.B.

In contrast, expression of a dominant-negative form of MYCC that inhibits the function of all three isoforms of MYC induces regression of tumors initiated by activated Ras, indicating that MYC function is required for the maintenance of tumors that are not initiated by MYC (8Soucek L.

MYC encodes a transcription factor that regulates the expression of a multitude of genes involved in cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation (9Dang C.V. O'Donnell K.A. Zeller K.I.

In fibroblasts and human tumor cells, Myc is required at several cell cycle transitions and induced loss of Myc activity causes cells to undergo growth arrest either at the G1/S transition or at a later step in the cell cycle (11Mateyak M.K.

In contrast, Myc does not appear to be required for the proliferation of certain normal cell lineages (14Baena E. Gandarillas A. Vallespinós M. Zanet J. Bachs O. Redondo C. Fabregat I.

Myc accelerates cell proliferation, at least in part, through its ability to down-regulate the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p27Kip1 (16Vlach J. Hennecke S.

We are interested in identifying the significance of MYCC overexpression in ovarian cancer. This cancer, although second in incidence as a gynecologic cancer, causes more deaths than all other gynecologic cancers combined, but the pathogenesis of the disease is poorly understood. Amplification of 8q24 was found to be very common in ovarian cancers (35–76%) (20Lancaster J.M. Dressman H.K. Whitaker R.S. Havrilesky L. Gray J. Marks J.R. Nevins J.R. Berchuck A. J. Soc. Gynecol.

Cancer. 2005; 15: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, associations between MYCC copy number changes and the degree of malignancy of ovarian cancers have been reported (23Dimova I. Raitcheva S. Dimitrov R. Doganov N. Toncheva D. Eur. J. Cancer. 2006; 42: 674-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine whether ovarian cancer cells are dependent on expression of MYCC or its paralogs, we used small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to down-regulate the expression of MYCC and MYC paralogs in a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines expressing varying levels of MYCC and compared the responses of these cells to those in normal ovarian surface epithelial cells immortalized by telomerase expression. Our findings indicate that ovarian cancer cells are dependent on the expression of MYCC or MYC family members, that the critical MYC-dependent step is Cdk2 activation, and that this dependence is mediated by p27Kip1. However MYCC-amplified cells undergo replicative senescence upon inactivation of MYC function, whereas MYCC non-amplified cells do not, suggesting that the nature of the MYC dependence differs in MYCC-amplified and non-amplified cells. These results have implications for the use of MYC antagonists in cancer therapy. Ovarian cancer cell lines with and without amplification at 8q24, Hey, Ovca420, A2780, and Caov3, were cultured as described previously (24Guan Y. Kuo W.L. Stilwell J.L. Takano H. Lapuk A.V.

Telomerase-immortalized normal ovary epithelial (TIOSE) cell lines, hTert4 and hTert6, were obtained from Michael J Birrer, NCI, NIH (25Zorn K.K. Jazaeri A.A. Awtrey C.S. Gardner G.J. Mok S.C.

TIOSE cell lines were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of medium 199 and MCDB 105 medium, supplemented with gentamicin (25 μg/ml), 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and G418 (500 μg/ml). Cells were cultured under standard conditions at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 95% room air and 5% CO2. siRNA transfections were carried out using RNAimax transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were co-transfected with an Alexa Fluor red fluorescent control oligonucleotide to analyze transfection efficiency, which was greater than 80% in all experiments. Cells were analyzed 48–76 h after transfection. Total RNA was purified from cultured cells using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), as described previously (12Prathapam T. Tegen S.

Lysis of cells was carried out as described previously (12Prathapam T. Tegen S. Oskarsson T. Trumpp A. Martin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 2695-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, blots were blocked in Odyssey blocking buffer (OBB; LI-COR) diluted 1:1 with PBS and incubated (12 h; 4 °C) with primary antibodies in OBB containing 0.1% Tween 20. They were then incubated (1 h, 22 °C) with secondary antibodies (0.1 μg/ml goat anti-mouse or 0.2 μg/ml goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to IR dyes) in OBB containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.01% SDS. Blots were quantified using an imaging system (Odyssey IR; LI-COR). Antibody against GAPDH was from Abcam, Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Antibody against phospho-Cdk2 was from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). All other antibodies used for immunoblotting were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cells were lysed in Cdk2 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mm NaVO4 containing protease inhibitors (174 μg/ml PMSF, 1.5 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 μg/ml phenanthroline, 0.5 μg/ml antipain, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml chymostatin)) for 15 min on ice. Samples containing equal amounts of protein as determined by BCA assay were used for immunoprecipitations. Lysates containing 200–500 μg protein were precleared by incubation with 1 μg of rabbit preimmune serum and 30 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 30 min. After a brief centrifugation to remove precleared beads, 0.5 μg of anti-Cdk2 antibody was added to each sample and incubated on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 2 h. 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads were added to each sample, and the slurries were incubated on the rocking platform at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were then washed five times with Cdk2 lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.1 μg/ml NaF, 10 μg/ml β-glycerophosphate, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Samples were resuspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (20 Ci/mmol), 5 mm DTT, and 0.21 μg of Rb C-terminal domain protein substrate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2× loading buffer (10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 3% SDS, 6.25 mm Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], and bromphenol blue). Reaction products were boiled for 10 min and then electrophoretically resolved by SDS-PAGE and phosphorylated Rb was visualized by autoradiography. The effects of siRNAs on cell cycle progression were assessed by measuring bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and flow cytometry analysis using a BrdU assay kit from Roche Diagnostics (Indianapolis) and the procedures specified by the manufacturer. In brief, cells were labeled with BrdU for 30 min and then fixed with 70% ice cold ethanol for 12 h, stained with mouse anti-BrdU antibody for 1 h at 37°C, followed by staining with fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody for 1 h at 37 °C. They were then incubated with RNase A (Sigma Aldrich) and stained with propidium iodide (Roche) prior to flow cytometry analysis. MTT assays were performed using an assay kit from ATCC (Manassas, VA) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells transfected with siRNAs were plated in triplicate 48 h after transfections. After a 12-h incubation, 10 μl of MTT reagent was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for another 2 to 4 h until a purple precipitate was visible. Then the detergent reagent was added, and the cell lysates left for 2 h in the dark at room temperature. Absorbance was monitored at 570 nm with a Microplate Reader (VersaMax, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The assay for the senescence-associated β-galactosidase was carried out using a Senescence Detection kit (Calbiochem, Gibbstown, NJ) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were plated in triplicate in 6-well culture plates, fixed at room temperature for 10–15 min, washed twice with PBS, and incubated with staining solution at 37 °C overnight. Cells were observed under bright-field illumination for development of blue color. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and incubated for 30 min in PBS containing 5% BSA and 10% normal goat serum. Samples were incubated with one primary antibody or a mixture of two primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Mouse monoclonal antibody directed against HP1γ (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against trimethyl K9 histone H3 (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and rabbit monoclonal antibody directed against phospho-histone H2A.X, Ser139 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) were used to detect senescence markers. Signals were developed using either goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were mounted in SlowFade antifade reagent containing DAPI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Images were collected at room temperature using a 510 confocal laser scanning microscope (510 LSM; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) and 510 LSM software (v. 3.2 sp2; Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Results were compared by Student's t test and statistical significance indicated in the figures (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01). All experiments were done independently at least three times, and data are expressed as mean ± S.E. In previous studies, a direct correlation between MYCC RNA levels and 8q24 copy number was observed (24Guan Y. Kuo W.L. Stilwell J.L. Takano H. Lapuk A.V. Fridlyand J. Mao J.H. Yu M. Miller M.A. Santos J.L. Kalloger S.E. Carlson J.W. Ginzinger D.G. Celniker S.E. Mills G.B. Huntsman D.G. Gray J.W. Clin. Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 5745-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). We selected a set of 4 ovarian cancer cell lines expressing varying amounts of Myc, with or without amplification of the MYCC gene, for further studies (Fig. 1A). As a control, we used a telomerase-immortalized normal ovary epithelial cell line (TIOSE), hTert4 (25Zorn K.K. Jazaeri A.A. Awtrey C.S. Gardner G.J. Mok S.C. Boyd J. Birrer M.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 4811-4818PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the MYCC expression and genomic amplification data, we defined Hey and Ovca420 as MYCC-amplified ovarian cancer cells, A2780 as a normal expression line and Caov3 as a MYCC non-amplified low expression line. The expression of MYCC was then blocked by transfection with a MYCC siRNA. Quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting analyses confirmed that the siRNA inhibition was effective (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). Flow cytometry following 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and propidium iodide staining was then used to determine the effects of MYCC RNAi on cell cycle distribution. Upon MYCC RNAi of the MYCC- amplified Hey and Ovca420 cells, the percentage of S-phase cells decreased from 27.5% to 2.9% in Hey cells and from 27.5% to 3.05% in Ovca420 cells, while the percentage of G1 cells increased from 64.6% to 95.8% in Hey cells and from 63.3% to 88.8% in Ovca420 cells (Fig. 1B), indicating that MYCC knockdown leads to a G1/S block in these cells. In contrast Caov3 cells which express low levels of MYCC RNA were not arrested upon MYCC RNAi (Fig. 1B), whereas in A2780 cells, in which there is no increase in MYCC expression, there was only a modest decrease in the fraction of S-phase cells, from 31.8% to 20.4% (Fig. 1B). This indicates that MYCC RNAi induced a G1 arrest only in MYCC-amplified cells, suggesting that MYCC-amplified ovarian cancer cell lines are specifically dependent on continued overexpression of the MYCC oncogene. Cell proliferation was also monitored by cell counting and MTT assays (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Consistent with the BrdU incorporation assays, the proliferation of Hey and Ovca420 cells was inhibited by MYCC knockdown, whereas the proliferation of A2780 and Caov3 was not. The inhibition of Hey and Ovca420 cell proliferation was still apparent 7 days after induction of RNAi (supplemental Figs. S2A and S6 and data not shown). These results suggest that MYCC-amplified ovarian cancer cell lines are specifically dependent on continued overexpression of the MYCC oncogene. To further investigate the hypothesis that MYCC-dependence is specific to MYCC-amplified lines, we examined the effect of siRNA inhibition of MYCC on the proliferation of the telomerase-immortalized normal ovary epithelial cell line hTert4 (25Zorn K.K. Jazaeri A.A. Awtrey C.S. Gardner G.J. Mok S.C. Boyd J. Birrer M.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 4811-4818PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, hTert4 cells continued to synthesize DNA upon inhibition of MYCC. In addition, the proliferation of the cells as judged by cell counting or MTT assays was not affected by MYCC knockdown (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the dependence of MYCC-amplified ovarian cancer cells on continued overexpression of MYCC results from MYCC amplification. One hypothesis to account for the resistance of the MYCC non-amplified cells to MYCC RNAi is that it is due to expression of the MYC paralogs MYCN and MYCL. We therefore quantified the levels of MYCL and MYCN RNAs by qRT-PCR (Fig. 2A). Both MYCL and MYCN RNAs were expressed in the two MYCC non-amplified cell lines A2780 and Caov3 cells. It has previously been reported that MYCL is overexpressed and in some cases amplified in many ovarian carcinomas (26Wu R. Lin L. Beer D.G. Ellenson L.H. Lamb B.J. Rouillard J.M. Kuick R. Hanash S. Schwartz D.R. Fearon E.R. Cho K.R. Am J Pathol. 2003; 162: 1603-1610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Meyer N. Penn L.Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 976-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar); however in these two lines, A2780 and Caov3, there is no detectable amplification of the MYCL locus. 3P. Spellman and J. W. Gray, unpublished data. Interestingly, the level of MYCL RNA was comparable or slightly lower than that in two TIOSE lines, hTert4 and hTert6, whereas the level of MYCN RNA was severalfold lower (Fig. 2A). In the two MYCC-amplified lines, the level of both MYCL and MYCN RNAs was considerably lower than in the normal immortalized lines, raising the possibility that high levels of MYCC expression may result in reduced expression of the other two MYC paralogs. RNAi knockdown of MYCL in these lines, using two different siRNAs (Fig. 2B), did not reduce BrdU incorporation, either alone or in combination with MYCC RNAi (Fig. 2B). This indicates that MYCL expression alone is not sufficient to account for the resistance of MYCC non-amplified cells to MYC RNAi. However when all three MYC isoforms, MYCC, MYCL, and MYCN were inhibited, the percentage of Caov3 and A2780 cells in S phase was significantly reduced (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the MYCC non-amplified lines Caov3 and A2780 are dependent on the function of MYC family members. In parallel with this reduction in BrdU incorporation, the proliferation of these non-amplified lines was reduced upon inhibition of all three MYC paralogs (supplemental Fig. S3). To further explore this hypothesis, we examined the effect of siRNA inhibition of all three MYC paralogs on the proliferation of the two TIOSE cell lines, hTert4 and hTert6 (25Zorn K.K. Jazaeri A.A. Awtrey C.S. Gardner G.J. Mok S.C. Boyd J. Birrer M.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 4811-4818PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these cell lines continued to enter S phase after knockdown of all three MYC family members (Fig. 2C). This difference between the behavior of ovarian cancer cells and normal ovarian surface epithelial cells indicates that ovarian cancer cells exhibit an increased dependence on the continued expression of MYC family members for continued cell proliferation. Inhibition of MYCC in MYCC-inducible mouse tumor models results in tumor regression that is accompanied by signs of replicative senescence (28Wu C.H. van Riggelen J. Yetil A. Fan A.C. Bachireddy P. Felsher D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13028-13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). To determine if this is also the case when MYCC-amplified ovarian cancer cells are subjected to MYCC knockdown in vitro, we initially examined the induction of the senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity in Hey and Ovca420 cells subjected to MYCC RNAi. SA-β-gal activity was detected in both MYCC-amplified lines upon MYCC RNAi (supplemental Fig. S4A). Replicative senescence is also characterized by the appearance of senescence-associated (SA-) heterochromatin foci in which genes regulated by the transcription factor E2F1 are transcriptionally repressed. These foci can be detected by staining with antibodies directed against the heteochromatin protein HP1γ or lysine-9 trimethylated histone H3 (H3K9me). Senescence-associated heterochromatin foci were detected in both Hey cells and Ovca420 cells upon MYCC knockdown (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Another marker of replicative senescence is the appearance of DNA damage, which can be recognized by foci of accumulation of serine 139-phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX). Foci of γH2AX accumulation were detected in the MYCC -amplified lines Hey and Ovca420 upon MYCC RNAi (Fig. 3B and data not shown), again confirming that these cells undergo replicative senescence upon MYCC RNAi. hTert4 cells did not exhibit markers of replicative senescence when subjected to MYCC RNAi (Fig. 3, A and B). To determine if markers of replicative senescence can be detected in MYCC non-amplified cells upon MYC inactivation, we subjected A2780 and Caov3 cells to either MYCC RNAi or knockdown of all three MYC paralogs and examined the cells for the expression of SA-β-gal, the appearance of SA-heterochromatin foci or evidence of DNA damage. The MYCC-non-amplified cells did not exhibit any signs of replicative senescence, even when proliferation was arrested by knockdown of all three MYC paralogs (supplemental Figs. S4 and S5, Fig. 3, and data not shown). Thus replicative senescence upon MYC inactivation is limited to the MYCC-amplified cells, and the non-amplified cells do not undergo replicative senescence even when their proliferation is arrested by inactivation of MYC function by knockdown all three MYC paralogs. Replicative senescence is a characteristic response to MYCC-inactivation of MYCC-induced tumors and a defining feature of oncogene addiction (28Wu C.H. van Riggelen J. Yetil A. Fan A.C. Bachireddy P. Felsher D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13028-13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar); thus the addiction of MYCC-amplified ovarian cancer cells to MYCC differs from the dependence of MYCC non-amplified cancer cells on MYC paralogs. To identify the mechanism by which MYCC RNAi leads to growth arrest, we investigated the effect of MYCC RNAi on the expression and activity of cell cycle regulators in MYCC-amplified cells and non-amplified cells. Myc promotes the induction of cyclin D2 and the activation of the cyclin D-associated kinases Cdk4 and Cdk6 during the reentry of cells into the cell cycle (11Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4672-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However MYCC RNAi did not affect the expression of cyclins D1 and D2 or the activities of Cdk4 and Cdk6 in any of the four ovarian cancer cell lines tested (data not shown). Thus the sensitivity of the MYCC-amplified lines to MYCC RNAi does not appear to result from a requirement for Myc for activation of the cyclin D-dependent kinases in G1. Cyclin D-associated Cdk4/6 and cyclin E/A-associated Cdk2 collaborate in the hyper-phosphorylation of Rb, thus promoting cell cycle progression (29Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Several studies, including our own, have shown that MYCC participates in the activation of cyclin E/A-Cdk2 complexes (12Prathapam T. Tegen S. Oskarsson T. Trumpp A. Martin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 2695-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Vlach J. Hennecke S. Alevizopoulos K. Conti D. Amati B.

Interestingly MYCC RNAi resulted in down-regulation of cyclin A expression in the MYCC-amplified Hey and Ovca420 lines, but not in the non-amplified Caov3 line (Fig. 4A); cyclin E expression was not affected by MYCC RNAi (data not shown). Furthermore, Cdk2 in vitro kinase activity was down-regulated by MYCC RNAi in MYCC-amplified cells, but not in non-amplified Caov3 cells (Fig. 4B, top panel). Cdk2 is activated by phosphorylation of Thr-160 in the activation loop, a phosphorylation that is carried out by the Cdk-activating enzyme Cdk7 (31Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Consistent with the down-regulation of Cdk2 activity, Cdk2 Thr-160 phosphorylation was also reduced by MYCC RNAi in MYCC-amplified cells (Fig. 4B, bottom panels). These observations suggest that a defect in the activity of Cdk2 is responsible for the proliferation arrest induced by MYCC RNAi in MYCC-amplified cells and that Myc regulation of Cdk2 activity plays an important role in the continued proliferation of MYCC-am"

However, the relative contribution of each depends on the taxon under study and its geographic context. Utilizing sea catfishes in the Cathorops mapale species group, this study tests the hypothesis that both reproductive strategies conferring limited dispersal opportunities and an apparent geomorphologic barrier in the Southern Caribbean have promoted speciation in this group from a little studied area of the world.Mitochondrial gene sequences were obtained from representatives of the Cathorops mapale species group across its distributional range from Colombia to Venezuela. Morphometric and meristic analyses were also done to assess morphologic variation. Along a approximately 2000 km transect, two major lineages, Cathorops sp. and C. mapale, were identified by levels of genetic differentiation, phylogenetic reconstructions, and morphological analyses. The lineages are separated by approximately 150 km at the Santa Marta Massif (SMM) in Colombia. The northward displacement of the SMM into the Caribbean in the early Pleistocene altered the geomorphology of the continental margin, ultimately disrupting the natural habitat of C. mapale. The estimated approximately 0.86 my divergence of the lineages from a common ancestor coincides with the timing of the SMM displacement at approximately 0.78 my.Results presented here support the hypothesis that organismal properties as well as extrinsic factors lead to diversification of the Cathorops mapale group along the northern coast of South America. While a lack of pelagic larval stages and ecological specialization are forces impacting this process, the identification of the SMM as contributing to allopatric speciation in marine organisms adds to the list of recognized barriers in the Caribbean. Comparative examination of additional Southern Caribbean taxa, particularly those with varying life history traits and dispersal capabilities, will determine the extent by which the SMM has influenced marine phylogeography in the region."

Little structural information is available about this receptor and its association with glucagon. We used the substituted cysteine accessibility method and three-dimensional molecular modeling based on the gastrointestinal insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor structures to study the N-terminal domain of this receptor, a central element for ligand binding and specificity. Our results showed that Asp63, Arg116, and Lys98 are essential for the receptor structure and/or ligand binding because mutations of these three residues completely disrupted or markedly impaired the receptor function. In agreement with these data, our models revealed that Asp63 and Arg116 form a salt bridge, whereas Lys98 is engaged in cation-π interactions with the conserved tryptophans 68 and 106. The native receptor could not be labeled by hydrophilic cysteine biotinylation reagents, but treatment of intact cells with [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate increased the glucagon binding site density. This result suggested that an unidentified protein with at least one free cysteine associated with the receptor prevented glucagon recognition and that [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate treatment relieved this inhibition. The substituted cysteine accessibility method was also performed on 15 residues selected using the three-dimensional models.

Gene expression of most eukaryotic organisms is regulated by an immense assortment of small RNAs and proteins that associate with them. These various components form networks known as RNA silencing pathways, most important of which employ small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs, or piwi-interacting RNAs to achieve sequence specificity (1Siomi H.

The functions of cellular RdRPs have been largely elusive, but recent studies have shed some light on their enigmatic character. Caenorhabditis elegans RdRPs have been shown to synthesize secondary siRNAs that are important for amplifying the initial silencing signal (5Ruby J.G. Jan C. Player C. Axtell M.J. Lee W. Nusbaum C.

Tetrahymena termophila RdRP (Rdr1) is known to interact with Dicer to produce endogenous siRNAs, whereas the RdRP (Rdp1) of Schizosaccharomyces pombe is critical for heterochromatic gene silencing (2Moazed D.

Most of the above studies imply that the main function of cellular RdRPs is in synthesizing siRNAs directly or making double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) from single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) templates to be used as Dicer substrate. For a long time, it was thought that cellular RdRPs are absent in insects and mammals, but recently, robust RdRP activities have been detected in Drosophila melanogaster and humans (12Lipardi C.

Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3343-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Quelling is initiated by repetitive genetic elements and is dependent on three genes: qde-1 (quelling defective) encoding an RdRP, qde-2 (a member of the Argonaute family), and qde-3 (a RecQ-like DNA helicase) (17Cogoni C.

It has been shown that overexpression of QDE-1 results in increased silencing and that expression of hairpin dsRNA molecules abolishes the need of QDE-1 activity, suggesting that the primary function of QDE-1 is to synthesize dsRNA to be used as substrates for the two Dicers (DCL-1 and DCL-2) of Neurospora (15Choudhary S.

The expression of QDE-2 is induced by dsRNA, and its steady-state levels are regulated by the DCLs (15Choudhary S. Lee H.C. Maiti M. He Q. Cheng P. Liu Q. Liu Y. Mol. Cell.

The biochemical roles of QDE-3 largely are unknown, but it has been suggested to have roles in both DNA repair and quelling (18Cogoni C. Macino G.

Nature. 2009; 459: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The classical model of transgene quelling in Neurospora begins by RNA polymerase II and QDE-3 synthesizing an aberrant RNA molecule, which is recognized by QDE-1 and converted into dsRNA (24Fulci V. Macino G. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2007; 10: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This dsRNA is digested to double-stranded siRNAs by the DCLs. These associate with QDE-2, which nicks the passenger strand of the siRNA that is degraded subsequently by the QIP exonuclease (25Maiti M. Lee H.C. Liu Y. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 590-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). QDE-2, now containing a single-stranded siRNA guide strand, finds its complementary mRNA (or aberrant RNA) targets, which leads to the silencing of both transgenic and endogenous transcripts. Recently, this model has been challenged by the discovery that quelling components have essential roles in the nucleus associated with DNA repair (27Lee H.C. Chang S.S. Choudhary S. Aalto A.P.

QDE-1 was shown to co-purify with ssDNA binding replication protein A (RPA), and DNA damage was shown to induce QDE-2 expression. Immunoprecipitation of QDE-2 from DNA damaged Neurospora cultures revealed a novel type of small RNAs known as QDE-2-interacting small RNAs that are mostly derived from the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus (27Lee H.C.

Notably, QDE-2-interacting small RNAs are derived from aberrant RNAs that are synthesized by QDE-1 and not by any of the canonical RNA polymerases. QDE-1 was shown to have a robust DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (DdRP) activity, generating a DNA/RNA hybrid from an ssDNA template (27Lee H.C. Chang S.S. Choudhary S. Aalto A.P. Maiti M. Bamford D.H. Liu Y. Nature. 2009; 459: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Much insight into the structure and function of cellular RdRPs has come from the studies of a recombinant QDE-1 and its catalytically active C-terminal portion QDE-1ΔN (residues 377–1402 of the wild-type) (29Makeyev E.V.

The recombinant polymerase is able to initiate RNA synthesis without a primer and convert heterologous ssRNAs into double-stranded molecules. In addition to making full-length dsRNA copies of ssRNA templates, QDE-1 was observed to synthesize small 9–21-nt RNAs scattered along template RNAs (29Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Mol.

The crystal structure of QDE-1ΔN showed that the molecule is a dimer and that the catalytic core has a fold that is related to those in eukaryotic DdRPs (31Salgado P.S. Koivunen M.R. Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Stuart D.I. Grimes J.M. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e434Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that QDE-1ΔN displays five distinct in vitro activities. We use structure-based mutagenesis to show that the activities can be dissected by mutating critical amino acid residues and suggest that RdRP and DdRP activities have different initiation mechanisms and pH optima. The biochemical data presented in this study imply a recognition mechanism that discerns a DNA template from an RNA template. These results have broader ramifications in eukaryotic RNA- and DNA-dependent RNA polymerases associated with RNA silencing pathways. The expression vectors for QDE-1ΔN point mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR. The mutagenic primers are listed in supplemental Table S1. Plasmid pEM69 (30Laurila M.R. Salgado P.S. Makeyev E.V. Nettelship J. Stuart D.I. Grimes J.M. Bamford D.H. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 149: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) encoding for a His-tagged QDE-1ΔN (missing amino acids 1–376) was used as a template in 50-μl PCR reactions each containing sense and antisense primers, and 2.5 units of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). After completion, the reactions were treated with 10 units of DpnI (Fermentas) and transformed into CaCl2 competent Escherichia coli XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene). The correct constructs were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. The recombinant proteins were expressed and purified as described previously for QDE-1ΔN (pEM69; (30Laurila M.R. Salgado P.S. Makeyev E.V. Nettelship J. Stuart D.I. Grimes J.M. Bamford D.H. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 149: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)). Briefly, the plasmids were introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain INVSc1 (Invitrogen), the recombinant proteins were expressed at +28 °C for 22 h and purified to near homogeneity. The yeast cells were first harvested and disrupted by a French press. The cell lysates were then cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatants were loaded onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity columns (Qiagen), washed with 5 mm and 25 mm imidazole-containing buffers, and eluted with 200 mm imidazole. Subsequently, the proteins were purified by HiTrapTM heparin HP and Q HP columns (GE Healthcare) and eluted by increasing NaCl gradients. The purified proteins were stored in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.13% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, and 62.5% glycerol at −20 °C. The oligomeric status of the recombinant polymerases was analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 16/60 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) with appropriate control proteins (Sigma). Plasmid pLM659 (32Gottlieb P. Strassman J. Qiao X. Frilander M. Frucht A. Mindich L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2611-2616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) contains a cDNA copy of the S segment of bacteriophage ϕ6 under a T7 promoter. For the production of ssRNA, pLM659 was linearized by SmaI digestion, purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and used as a template for run-off transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. The template DNA was degraded with DNaseI (Promega) and the ssRNA purified by chloroform extraction and LiCl precipitation. To generate a ssDNA molecule of the same length and sequence, SmaI-digested pLM659 was used as a template in PCR reactions containing primers AO49 and AO50 (see supplemental Table S4) and Phusion® DNA polymerase (Finnzymes). AO50 contains a 5′-biotin. The biotinylated PCR product was immobilized onto Dynabeads® MyOneTM streptavidin C1 magnetic beads (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The immobilized PCR product was dissolved by treating the DNA briefly with fresh 0.1 m NaOH. The ssDNA was precipitated with sodium acetate and ethanol and gel-purified through agarose gel electrophoresis. Prior to 5′-labeling, the ssRNA was treated with alkaline phosphatase (Finnzymes). Both ssRNA and ssDNA were 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Radiochemicals, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas). M13mp18 ssDNA was purchased from New England Biolabs. The oligonuleotides (AO49–52) were purchased from biomers.net or Eurofins MWG Operon. Polymerase reactions were performed essentially as described (29Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1417-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 33Yang H. Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11088-11095Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The standard QDE-1 reaction mixture contained 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 20 mm ammonium acetate, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 6% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm of each NTP, 1 unit/μl RNasin® ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega), and 0.01–0.02 μg/μl QDE-1ΔN. In some of the pH experiments, HEPES-KOH (pH 7.2–7.8) was replaced by Bis-Tris (pH 6.0–6.9) or Tris-HCl (pH 8.0–8.9). The ladder reactions were programmed with 5 mm MgCl2. Reactions were supplemented with 0.1 mCi/ml of [α-32P]UTP (GE Healthcare or NEN Radiochemicals, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or other radioactive NTPs where indicated. The reactions were incubated at +30 °C for 1 h and quenched with U2 (8 m urea, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 6% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol) loading buffer. Some reaction products were extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1), precipitated with NH4OAc and ethanol, and dissolved in milli-Q water. Some samples were treated with RNase T1 (Fermentas) for 15 min at +37 °C. The samples were subjected to standard Tris-Borate-EDTA or Tris-Acetate-EDTA agarose gel electrophoresis or denaturing, formaldehyde-containing agarose gel electrophoresis (34Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2001Google Scholar). The gels were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and dried, and radioactivity was detected by phosphorimaging (Fuji FLA-5000) and analyzed by densitometry with AIDA software (Raytest Isotopenmeβgeräte). Some samples were subjected to denaturing PAGE by urea-containing 20% sequencing gels. These were either desalted by Zeba Spin Desalting Columns (Thermo Scientific) or purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Prior to loading, the samples were mixed with Gel Loading Buffer II (Ambion) and heated to +95 °C for 5 min. To elucidate the different catalytic activities of QDE-1ΔN, standard polymerization reactions were carried out with ssRNA or ssDNA templates in different conditions (Fig. 1A). Mixing QDE-1ΔN with ssRNA, all four NTPs and [α-32P]UTP resulted in dsRNA synthesis as well as decreased mobility (shifting) and labeling of the ssRNA template (lane 2). In addition, labeled RNA products were detected that varied in size from tens of nucleotides to several hundreds. Some of these products did not enter the agarose gel and remained in the wells. No labeled products were detected when the catalytically inactive QDE-1ΔNDA was used in the reaction mix (lane 3) (29Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1417-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). When the reactions were carried out with only UTP and trace amounts of [α-32P]UTP, the template ssRNA was efficiently labeled without dsRNA synthesis (lane 4), indicating that QDE-1ΔN is a potent terminal nucleotidyltransferase (TNTase). QDE-1ΔN displays also a strong DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity (lane 6) (27Lee H.C. Chang S.S. Choudhary S. Aalto A.P. Maiti M. Bamford D.H. Liu Y. Nature. 2009; 459: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). None of the template ssDNA migrates as template-sized but is very efficiently converted to the DNA/RNA hybrid form (lane 6). Again, substituting the ΔN polymerase with QDE-1ΔN DA abolishes this activity (lane 7). The TNTase activity also is very prominent with an ssDNA template (lane 8). Using only UTP as the substrate, the ssDNA template migrates at its normal position (upper panel) but is extensively labeled (lower panel). The above experiments show that QDE-1ΔN displays five distinct activities (Fig. 1, A and B): (i) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity (Fig. 1A, lane 2) (29Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1417-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), (ii) DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity (Fig. 1A, lane 6) (27Lee H.C. Chang S.S. Choudhary S. Aalto A.P. Maiti M. Bamford D.H. Liu Y. Nature. 2009; 459: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), (iii) ssRNA template shift and labeling activity (Fig. 1A, lane 2), (iv) TNTase activity (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 8), and (v) ladder activity (Fig. 1A, lanes 2, 6, and 9) (supplemental Fig. S1). Activities (i) and (ii) have been described previously (27Lee H.C. Chang S.S. Choudhary S. Aalto A.P. Maiti M. Bamford D.H. Liu Y. Nature. 2009; 459: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 29Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1417-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Activity (iii) has been suggested previously to result from the synthesis of 9–21-nt small RNAs that are scattered across the ssRNA template, as well as to be the main in vitro reaction product of QDE-1ΔN (29Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1417-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, in this work, the intensity of the ssRNA labeling was not significantly more extensive than the labeling of the dsRNA product (Fig. 1A, lane 2), suggesting that the “small RNAs” are not the main reaction product. The identity of this activity is further discussed below. TNTase activity (iv) (see below) has been detected previously in both viral and eukaryotic RdRPs, where nucleotides are added to the 3′-ends of the templates in a template-independent fashion (11Curaba J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3059-3066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 35Poranen M.M. Koivunen M.R. Bamford D.H. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 9254-9264Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Activity (v) (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1) was assigned as a ladder activity because it generates RNA products of all sizes. When the reaction products of a reaction without a template were analyzed on a denaturing sequencing gel, they migrated at one-nucleotide increments (starting from ∼8 nts) forming a “ladder” (supplemental Fig. S1A). This activity is template-independent because omitting the template does not affect the formation of the ladder (Fig. 1A, lane 9). However, the sensitivity of the ladder activity to varying reaction conditions suggests that it is an in vitro side reaction occurring at high enzyme and substrate conditions (supplemental Fig. S1). The in vitro activities of QDE-1ΔN are summarized schematically in Fig. 1B. As QDE-1 displays both RNA- and DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activities, we further studied the nature of these reactions. We programmed polymerization reactions with ssRNA or ssDNA templates of the same length and sequence, purified the reaction products, and analyzed them by denaturing formaldehyde-containing agarose gel electrophoresis. As controls we labeled the templates at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase (Fig. 2A). As has been shown previously (29Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1417-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), most of the product that accumulated using an ssRNA template migrated more slowly than the template, indicating that the strands of the dsRNA molecule are covalently linked together (“back-priming”). In contrast, the products of the reaction using an ssDNA template migrated as template-sized or smaller, indicating that the mode of RNA synthesis initiation differs between these two templates. This result is further supported by an experiment where RdRP and DdRP reactions were carried out with an initiating nucleotide that was 32P-labeled at the γ-phosphate (Fig. 2B). In this experimental setup, the product RNA can be labeled only if the γ-phosphate remains within the first nucleotide of the new strand. Conversely, if RNA synthesis is initiated by back-priming, the γ-phosphate is removed from the product RNA. As expected, radioactivity was detected only in the double-stranded products of the ssDNA template (DNA/RNA hybrids) and the template-sized products of the ssRNA template (resulting from abortive initiation, see below). dsRNA was not labeled. In addition, we performed QDE-1ΔN activity assays with both ssRNA and ssDNA templates in the same reaction mixture simultaneously (supplemental Fig. S2). The RdRP or DdRP activities did not inhibit each other, but both templates were processed into products. The ssDNA template in this experiment was circular, indicating that QDE-1ΔN is able to initiate RNA synthesis without the need for a free 3′-end (supplemental Fig. S2). All in all, these data suggest that QDE-1 is able to discriminate between ssRNA and ssDNA templates. The crystal structure of QDE-1ΔN has been solved previously (31Salgado P.S. Koivunen M.R. Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Stuart D.I. Grimes J.M. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e434Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Using the structural information, we designed eight point mutations that were predicted to functionally disrupt QDE-1ΔN (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S3 and Tables S1 and S2). The constructs were transformed into S. cerevisiae, and the recombinant proteins were expressed. All of the mutant enzymes were soluble and purified to near homogeneity and behaved like the wild-type during purification (data not shown). Initial screening of the RdRP and DdRP activities of the point mutants revealed that they possessed characteristics that differed from the wild-type polymerase (supplemental Fig. S4A). As expected (as these were assumed to be catalytically essential aspartic acids), QDE-1ΔNDA (D1011A) (29Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1417-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and D1007A were catalytically completely inactive. Of the active point mutants, five (R738A, R944E, K1119W, M1357D, and M1357C) were chosen for more extensive studies due to their catalytic properties. Arg738 lies within a channel that is predicted to accommodate the reaction product of QDE-1ΔN and direct it away from the active site (Fig. 3A). The R944E mutation is predicted to partly block the communication tunnel that links the two active sites in a QDE-1ΔN dimer (Fig. 3A). The K1119W mutation was designed to occlude a pore in QDE-1ΔN that apparently allows substrate nucleotides to enter the active site. The M1357D and M1357C mutations are predicted to respectively weaken and lock together the dimeric interface of the QDE-1ΔN head domains (Fig. 3A). However, the interface of the entire QDE-1 dimer is so extensive that mutating Met1357 should not affect the oligomerization state of the enzyme. To confirm this, we performed analytical gel filtration chromatography with QDE-1ΔN WT in different conditions, some of the point mutant enzymes, and control proteins of various sizes (Table 1). Dimeric QDE-1ΔN is predicted to be ∼230 kDa in size, whereas a monomer would have the predicted size of ∼120 kDa (31Salgado P.S. Koivunen M.R. Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Stuart D.I. Grimes J.M. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e434Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Our results establish that all QDE-1ΔN enzymes are dimeric, regardless of the surrounding pH (Table 1). This has been deduced previously from the crystal structure, as each of the subunits has >2000 Å2 of contact area with the neighboring subunit (31Salgado P.S. Koivunen M.R. Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Stuart D.I. Grimes J.M.

The catalytic activity of R738A is reduced to approximately half of that of the wild-type regardless of the template (Fig. 3C), in accordance with a nonspecific charge steering role for this residue. In addition, R738A is incapable of shifting and labeling the ssRNA template (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S4A). The DdRP activity of R944E is close to that of the native polymerase. However, its RdRP activity is only ∼20% of the wild-type (Fig. 3C). It shifts the ssRNA template and labels it efficiently (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fi"
https://openalex.org/W2052379027,"Collecting duct-derived ET-1 regulates salt excretion and blood pressure. We have reported the presence of an inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD)-specific enhancer region in the 5′-upstream ET-1 promoter (Strait, K. A., Stricklett, P. K., Kohan, J. L., Miller, M. B., and Kohan, D. E. (2007) Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 293, F601–F606). The current studies provide further characterization of the ET-1 5′-upstream distal promoter to identify the IMCD-specific enhancer elements. Deletion studies identified two regions of the 5′-upstream ET-1 promoter, −1725 to −1319 bp and −1319 to −1026 bp, which were required for maximal promoter activity in transfected rat IMCD cells. Transcription factor binding site analysis of these regions identified two consensus nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) binding sites at −1263 and −1563. EMSA analysis using nuclear extracts from IMCD cells showed that both the −1263 and the −1563 NFAT sites in the ET-1 distal promoter competed for NFAT binding to previously identified NFAT sites in the IL-2 and TNF genes. Gel supershift analysis showed that each of the NFAT binding sites in the ET-1 promoter bound NFAT proteins derived from IMCD nuclear extracts, but they selectively bound different NFAT isoforms; ET-1263 bound NFATc1, whereas ET-1563 bound NFATc3. Site-directed mutagenesis of either the ET-1263 or the ET-1563 sites prevented NFAT binding and reduced ET-1 promoter activity. Thus, NFAT appears to be an important regulator of ET-1 transcription in IMCD cells, and thus, it may play a role in controlling blood pressure through ET-1 regulation of renal salt excretion. Collecting duct-derived ET-1 regulates salt excretion and blood pressure. We have reported the presence of an inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD)-specific enhancer region in the 5′-upstream ET-1 promoter (Strait, K. A., Stricklett, P. K., Kohan, J. L., Miller, M.

Site-directed mutagenesis of either the ET-1263 or the ET-1563 sites prevented NFAT binding and reduced ET-1 promoter activity. Thus, NFAT appears to be an important regulator of ET-1 transcription in IMCD cells, and thus, it may play a role in controlling blood pressure through ET-1 regulation of renal salt excretion. IntroductionEndothelin-1 (ET-1) is a 21-amino acid peptide initially isolated from endothelial cells that functions as a potent vasoconstrictor (1Yanagisawa M. Kurihara H. Kimura S. Tomobe Y. Kobayashi M. Mitsui Y. Yazaki Y. Goto K. Masaki T. Nature. 1988; 332: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10183) Google Scholar). Since its discovery, it has become apparent that besides vasoconstriction, ET-1 exerts multiple effects, including regulation of mitogenesis, hypertrophy, synthesis of extracellular matrix, ion transport, and many others (2Rubanyi G.M. Polokoff M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 325-415PubMed Google Scholar). In the vast majority of instances, ET-1 exerts its effects via autocrine or paracrine mechanisms, producing localized regulation of cellular functions.Although most work on ET-1 regulation has been confined to endothelial cells of the vasculature, in the past several years, the kidney has also emerged as a major site of ET-1 actions (3Kohan D.E. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2006; 15: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the kidney, ET-1 has been shown to modulate a number of important physiological processes, including blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, salt and water excretion, and acid/base handling. Given the critical role ET-1 plays in renal physiology, it was not surprising to discover that almost every cell type in the kidney synthesizes ET-1 and/or contains ET-1 receptors. The kidney is also, by some accounts, 10 times more sensitive to ET-1 actions than the vasculature (4Pernow J. Franco-Cereceda A. Matran R. Lundberg J.M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1989; 13: S205-S206Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Finally, within kidney, the inner medullary collecting duct cells may have the highest concentrations of ET-1 immunoreactivity of any cell type in the body (5Kitamura K. Tanaka T. Kato J. Eto T. Tanaka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).In the nephron, collecting duct cells produce more ET-1 than any other cell type (6Kohan D.E. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1997; 29: 2-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In the collecting duct, ET-1 has been shown to inhibit both sodium (7Zeidel M.L. Brady H.R. Kone B.C. Gullans S.R. Brenner B.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C1101-C1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gallego M.S. Ling B.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F451-F460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and water reabsorption (9Tomita K. Nonoguchi H. Marumo F. Contrib. Nephrol. 1991; 95: 207-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The actions of ET-1 on sodium and water reabsorption make it a target in the study of renal-induced hypertension. Mice containing a collecting duct-specific deletion of the ET-1 gene are hypertensive and have impaired water and sodium excretion (10Ahn D. Ge Y. Stricklett P.K. Gill P. Taylor D. Hughes A.K. Yanagisawa M. Miller L. Nelson R.D. Kohan D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Decreased ET-1 production in the collecting duct has also been reported in animal models of hypertension, whereas decreased ET-1 levels have been observed in the urine of patients with essential hypertension (3Kohan D.E. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2006; 15: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These data indicate that collecting duct-derived ET-1 plays an important role in controlling systemic blood pressure by blocking salt and water reabsorption in the collecting duct. Several studies have shown that medullary ET-1 production is increased by salt (11Yang T. Terada Y. Nonoguchi H. Ujiie K. Tomita K. Marumo F. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F684-F689PubMed Google Scholar, 12Migas I. Bäcker A. Meyer-Lehnert H. Kramer H.J. Am. J. Hypertens. 1995; 8: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and water loading (13Zeiler M. Löffler B.M. Bock H.A. Thiel G. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: S513-S515Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 14Modesti P.A. Cecioni I. Migliorini A. Naldoni A. Costoli A. Vanni S. Serneri G.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H1070-H1077PubMed Google Scholar). However, the cellular factors regulating collecting duct ET-1 production are poorly understood.ET-1 mRNA has a short half-life (∼15 min), which is directly related to the presence of three destabilizing AUUUA motifs in the 3′-untranslated region (15Inoue A. Yanagisawa M. Takuwa Y. Mitsui Y. Kobayashi M. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14954-14959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This results in ET-1 expression being exquisitely sensitive to transcriptional regulation. To date, several cis-acting elements have been described within the ET-1 promoter. An activator protein (AP-1) site is located at −109 to −102 to which c-Jun-c-Fos binding is required for constitutive promoter activity (16Lee M.E. Bloch K.D. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10446-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A GATA binding site is located further upstream (−131 to −136) and acts synergistically with the AP-1 site to produce basal ET-1 promoter activity that is endothelial cell-specific (17Lee M.E. Temizer D.H. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16188-16192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lee M.E. Dhadly M.S. Temizer D.H. Clifford J.A. Yoshizumi M. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19034-19039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lesser elements capable of enhancing the GATA-AP-1 induction of ET-1 expression have also been identified within this same proximal promoter region and include NF-κB (19Quehenberger P. Bierhaus A.

The conclusion from these studies was that ET-1 transcription in endothelial cells was robust and driven primarily by cooperative interactions of the AP-1 and GATA sequences in conjunction with several lesser elements, all of which are located within the first 350 bp 5′-upstream of the start site of transcription.In a previous study from our laboratory (22Strait K.A. Stricklett P.K. Kohan J.L. Miller M.B. Kohan D.E. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: F601-F606Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we examined the regulation of the ET-1 promoter in endothelial as compared with renal IMCD 2The abbreviations used are: IMCDinner medullary collecting ductNFATnuclear factor of activated T-cellsTKthymidine kinase. cells. As anticipated from the previous studies cited above, we showed that maximal transcriptional activity of the rat ET-1 promoter in primary cultures of aortic endothelial cells was confined to the first −366 bp of 5′-upstream sequence; additional sequences up to 3.0 kb 5′-upstream produced no further enhancement of promoter activity. However, in similar studies using IMCD cells, we found that the −366-bp region did not produce maximal promoter activity. In IMCD cells, maximal promoter activity (5-fold greater than −366 bp) required additional sequences between 1.0 and 1.7 kb 5′-upstream of the ET-1 transcription start site. The observation that additional regions of the ET-1 promoter are transcriptionally active in IMCD cells may be a reflection of the unique role ET-1 plays in kidney regulation of salt and water homeostasis.In the current studies, we have sought to further characterize the 5′-upstream region of the ET-1 promoter to identify the regulatory elements that appear selectively active in IMCD cells. Deletion analysis identified two regions of the 5′-upstream ET-1 promoter, −1725 to −1319 bp and −1319 to −1026 bp, which were required for maximal promoter activity in IMCD cells. Computer-assisted transcription factor binding site analysis of these regions identified two consensus NFAT binding sites at −1263 and −1563 bp upstream of the start site of transcription. Site-directed mutagenesis of either site produced a significant reduction in ET-1 promoter activity. EMSA analysis showed that both sites were capable of competing for NFAT binding to previously identified NFAT sites in the IL-2 and TNF genes. Finally, gel supershift analysis showed that each of the NFAT binding sites in the ET-1 promoter bind different NFAT isoforms. Thus, NFAT appears to be an important regulator of ET-1 transcription in IMCD cells, and therefore, it may be an important factor in the regulation of renal salt and water balance and blood pressure.DISCUSSIONPreviously, using ET-1 promoter reporter transfection assays, we identified a distal region located −1.0 to −3.0 kb 5′-upstream of the ET-1 promoter that was required for maximal expression of ET-1 in IMCD cells (22Strait K.A. Stricklett P.K. Kohan J.L. Miller M.B. Kohan D.E. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: F601-F606Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Transfection of this same region into primary cultures of aorta endothelial cells produced no increase in ET-1 promoter activity. In endothelial cells, maximal ET-1 promoter activity was achieved with as little as −366 of the proximal promoter, an indication that this region may also contain cell type-specific enhancer elements. In the present study, through the use of deletion and mutational analyses, we have identified two previously unrecognized consensus NFAT binding sites located at −1263 and −1563 bp upstream of the start site of transcription in the ET-1 promoter that appear to play a significant role in the increased distal ET-1 promoter activity observed in IMCD cells. In addition, to our knowledge, this constitutes the first detailed characterization of NFAT regulation of the ET-1 promoter in any cell type.NFAT proteins are found in nearly every cell in the body and comprise a family of transcription factors (NFATs 1–5) that regulate the expression of genes involved in a wide range of cellular processes, such as immune response, vertebrate development, cell proliferation, and organ development (27Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar). The NFAT proteins contain a DNA binding, Rel homology domain (RHR) and are, therefore, part of a larger superfamily of Rel domain proteins that include the NF-κB proteins. Members of the Rel family of transcription factors bind GGA core DNA motifs. For the NFAT proteins, the GGA motif is flanked at its 3′-end with an adenine tract to yield 5′-GGAAAA-3′ as the consensus NFAT binding site. In the ET-1 promoter, both the ET-1263 and the ET-1563 sites contain the consensus GGAAAA NFAT binding motif.The NFAT proteins can bind to DNA as homo- and heterodimers, often with other members of the Rel family (28Macian F. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 472-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). Sites that can bind NFAT and NF-κB have been found in the HIV-LTR, IL-8, and IL-13 (27Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar). In our EMSA studies, we observed a complex pattern of shifted bands similar to what several other laboratories have reported using other NFAT sites (29Cockerill P.N. Bert A.G. Jenkins F. Ryan G.R. Shannon M.F. Vadas M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2071-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 30Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A. Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 31Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A. Nature. 1992; 356: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple gel-shifted bands is consistent with the presence of NFAT monomer and dimer binding to DNA elements. Although the ET-1263 and ET-1563 enhancer elements both contain the same consensus GGAAAA site, the NFAT DNA binding at each site appears dramatically different, as evidenced by differences in the pattern and number of shifted bands between the ET-1263 and the ET-1563 sites and supershift analysis that indicates that NFATc3-NFAT4 preferentially binds the −1563 site, whereas NFATc1-NFAT2 binds the ET-1263 site.NFAT proteins are also capable of forming strong cooperative complexes with unrelated transcription factors such as GATA, Maf, Oct, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, and AP-1-Jun-Fos (25Hogan P.G. Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2205-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar) on “composite” elements. Of the non-related binding partners, NFAT-Jun-Fos complexes have been the most extensively studied. Composite elements containing both NFAT and AP-1 binding sites have been identified in several genes (25Hogan P.G. Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2205-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar). Complexes of NFAT-Jun-Fos serve as signal integrators for two of the major pathways in the cell: calcium/calcineurin activation of NFAT and the DAG/protein kinase C (PKC) activation of Jun-Fos. In the case of ET-1, there is extensive literature on the effects of PKC on the expression of both ET-1 mRNA and protein (18Lee M.E. Dhadly M.S. Temizer D.H. Clifford J.A. Yoshizumi M. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19034-19039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kawana M. Lee M.E. Quertermous E.E. Quertermous T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4225-4231Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 33Tasaka K. Kitazumi K. Gen. Pharmacol. 1994; 25: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As mentioned in the Introduction, an AP-1 site has previously been identified in the ET-1 proximal promoter region (−109 to −102) (16Lee M.E. Bloch K.D. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10446-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of multiple gel-shifted bands is consistent with both the presence of NFAT dimer binding and the presence of a composite NFAT element. Whether either of the identified ET-1 NFAT binding sites functions as a composite NFAT-AP-1 site or whether there is cooperative interaction between the ET-1563 and the ET-1263 sites and the AP-1 site in the proximal promoter or interaction with other distal AP-1 sites is an area of active investigation in our laboratory.The inactive form of the NFAT proteins 1–4 is found in the cytoplasm. Activation is initiated by dephosphorylation of the NFAT regulatory domain by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. Activation of calcineurin in the cell is tied to increases in intracellular Ca2+ mediated by phospholipase C coupled to plasma membrane receptors and “store-operated” Ca2+ channels. Calcium is one of the most extensively studied regulators of ET-1 production (22Strait K.A. Stricklett P.K. Kohan J.L. Miller M.B. Kohan D.E. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: F601-F606Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 33Tasaka K. Kitazumi K. Gen. Pharmacol. 1994; 25: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Despite this, the effects of Ca2+ on ET-1 synthesis are quite variable between cell types. The current studies may help explain some of these differences in ET-1 regulation by Ca2+. In our previous studies on ET-1 promoter regulation in IMCD cells, the calmodulin inhibitor W7 completely blocked the activity of the distal regulatory elements located between −1026 and −3048 bp yet had no effect on the −1026 or the −366-bp ET-1 promoter fragments (22Strait K.A. Stricklett P.K. Kohan J.L. Miller M.B. Kohan D.E. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: F601-F606Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The presence of NFAT enhancer elements at ET-1263 and ET-1563, within the −1026 to −3048 W7-sensitive region, suggests a mechanism for the actions of W7; W7 may block Ca2+/calmodulin activation of calcineurin, resulting in a loss of NFAT activity at the ET-1263 and ET-1563 enhancer elements. Furthermore, the variability in Ca2+ effects on ET-1 production, previously reported in the literature (6Kohan D.E. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1997; 29: 2-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) may be accounted for by the fact that the distal enhancer region that contains the NFAT binding sites shows tissue-specific activity because it is active in IMCD cells, but not in endothelial cells (22Strait K.A. Stricklett P.K. Kohan J.L. Miller M.B. Kohan D.E. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: F601-F606Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Full confirmation of this hypothesis awaits additional studies.Published studies have shown that the tonicity-responsive enhancer-binding protein (TonEBP-NFAT5) is expressed in IMCD cells (34Hasler U. Jeon U.S. Kim J.A. Mordasini D. Kwon H.M. Féraille E. Martin P.Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 1521-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Given the high tonicity environment in which the cells of the IMCD reside, we were somewhat surprised that we did not observe NFAT5-TonEBP binding to either of the ET-1563 or the ET-1263 elements in our supershift experiments. One possible explanation for the lack of observable NFAT5 binding could be due to obtaining nuclear extracts for gel shift from cultured IMCD cells grown in isotonic media, thereby lacking the high tonicity environment required for NFAT5 induction. Further studies are planned to address this possibility.The current study provides convincing evidence that NFAT proteins regulate expression of ET-1 in IMCD by binding to the ET-1 promoter at both the ET-1563 and the ET-1263 elements. Ultimately, one must consider the physiologic relevance of this ET-1 regulatory system. As stated earlier, collecting duct ET-1 plays a vitally important role in controlling renal sodium excretion and maintaining normal blood pressure. Knock-out of ET-1 or both ETA and ETB receptors in the collecting duct causes severe salt-sensitive hypertension and sodium excretion (10Ahn D. Ge Y. Stricklett P.K. Gill P. Taylor D. Hughes A.K. Yanagisawa M. Miller L. Nelson R.D. Kohan D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 35Ge Y. Ahn D. Stricklett P.K. Hughes A.K. Yanagisawa M. Verbalis J.G.

Renal Physiol. 2005; 289: F692-F698Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Collecting duct ET-1 production is increased by high sodium or water intake, thereby stimulating ET-1 autocrine inhibition of collecting duct sodium and water reabsorption and preventing an increase in blood pressure (3Kohan D.E. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2006; 15: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6Kohan D.E. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1997; 29: 2-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Furthermore, reduced urinary ET-1 excretion is associated with hypertension in experimental animals and in humans (3Kohan D.E. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2006; 15: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, how collecting duct-derived ET-1 is regulated is a fundamentally important biologic question. Our current study suggests that NFAT is one factor that potentially plays a significant role in modulating collecting duct ET-1 production and that such regulation may be unique to this cell type (at least as compared with endothelial cells). Additional studies will be required to determine the functional significance of these NFAT binding sites in the physiologic regulation of ET-1 expression in kidney.Taken together with our previous studies showing the importance of Ca2+ and calmodulin in controlling collecting duct ET-1 synthesis, the present study helps to build the framework of a signaling pathway that transmits external signals to the collecting duct, leading to alterations in ET-1 production. A key question is what is the nature of such external signals; although these are being actively investigated, the finding that NFAT isoforms are important suggests that continued efforts to understand how NFAT isoforms act and how they are regulated in the collecting duct will likely yield significant insight into how the ET-1 system in this cell type is controlled. IntroductionEndothelin-1 (ET-1) is a 21-amino acid peptide initially isolated from endothelial cells that functions as a potent vasoconstrictor (1Yanagisawa M. Kurihara H. Kimura S. Tomobe Y. Kobayashi M. Mitsui Y. Yazaki Y. Goto K. Masaki T. Nature. 1988; 332: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10183) Google Scholar). Since its discovery, it has become apparent that besides vasoconstriction, ET-1 exerts multiple effects, including regulation of mitogenesis, hypertrophy, synthesis of extracellular matrix, ion transport, and many others (2Rubanyi G.M. Polokoff M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 325-415PubMed Google Scholar). In the vast majority of instances, ET-1 exerts its effects via autocrine or paracrine mechanisms, producing localized regulation of cellular functions.Although most work on ET-1 regulation has been confined to endothelial cells of the vasculature, in the past several years, the kidney has also emerged as a major site of ET-1 actions (3Kohan D.E. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2006; 15: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the kidney, ET-1 has been shown to modulate a number of important physiological processes, including blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, salt and water excretion, and acid/base handling. Given the critical role ET-1 plays in renal physiology, it was not surprising to discover that almost every cell type in the kidney synthesizes ET-1 and/or contains ET-1 receptors. The kidney is also, by some accounts, 10 times more sensitive to ET-1 actions than the vasculature (4Pernow J. Franco-Cereceda A. Matran R. Lundberg J.M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1989; 13: S205-S206Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Finally, within kidney, the inner medullary collecting duct cells may have the highest concentrations of ET-1 immunoreactivity of any cell type in the body (5Kitamura K. Tanaka T. Kato J. Eto T. Tanaka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).In the nephron, collecting duct cells produce more ET-1 than any other cell type (6Kohan D.E. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1997; 29: 2-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In the collecting duct, ET-1 has been shown to inhibit both sodium (7Zeidel M.L. Brady H.R. Kone B.C. Gullans S.R. Brenner B.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C1101-C1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gallego M.S. Ling B.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F451-F460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and water reabsorption (9Tomita K. Nonoguchi H. Marumo F. Contrib. Nephrol. 1991; 95: 207-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The actions of ET-1 on sodium and water reabsorption make it a target in the study of renal-induced hypertension. Mice containing a collecting duct-specific deletion of the ET-1 gene are hypertensive and have impaired water and sodium excretion (10Ahn D. Ge Y. Stricklett P.K. Gill P. Taylor D. Hughes A.K. Yanagisawa M. Miller L. Nelson R.D. Kohan D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Decreased ET-1 production in the collecting duct has also been reported in animal models of hypertension, whereas decreased ET-1 levels have been observed in the urine of patients with essential hypertension (3Kohan D.E. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2006; 15: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These data indicate that collecting duct-derived ET-1 plays an important role in controlling systemic blood pressure by blocking salt and water reabsorption in the collecting duct. Several studies have shown that medullary ET-1 production is increased by salt (11Yang T. Terada Y. Nonoguchi H. Ujiie K. Tomita K. Marumo F. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F684-F689PubMed Google Scholar, 12Migas I. Bäcker A. Meyer-Lehnert H. Kramer H.J. Am. J. Hypertens. 1995; 8: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and water loading (13Zeiler M. Löffler B.M. Bock H.A. Thiel G. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: S513-S515Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 14Modesti P.A. Cecioni I. Migliorini A. Naldoni A. Costoli A. Vanni S. Serneri G.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H1070-H1077PubMed Google Scholar). However, the cellular factors regulating collecting duct ET-1 production are poorly understood.ET-1 mRNA has a short half-life (∼15 min), which is directly related to the presence of three destabilizing AUUUA motifs in the 3′-untranslated region (15Inoue A. Yanagisawa M. Takuwa Y. Mitsui Y. Kobayashi M. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14954-14959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This results in ET-1 expression being exquisitely sensitive to transcriptional regulation. To date, several cis-acting elements have been described within the ET-1 promoter. An activator protein (AP-1) site is located at −109 to −102 to which c-Jun-c-Fos binding is required for constitutive promoter activity (16Lee M.E. Bloch K.D. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10446-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A GATA binding site is located further upstream (−131 to −136) and acts synergistically with the AP-1 site to produce basal ET-1 promoter activity that is endothelial cell-specific (17Lee M.E. Temizer D.H. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16188-16192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lee M.E. Dhadly M.S. Temizer D.H. Clifford J.A. Yoshizumi M. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19034-19039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lesser elements capable of enhancing the GATA-AP-1 induction of ET-1 expression have also been identified within this same proximal promoter region and include NF-κB (19Quehenberger P. Bierhaus A. Fasching P. Muellner C. Klevesath M. Hong M. Stier G. Sattler M. Schleicher E. Speiser W. Nawroth P.P.

The conclusion from these studies was that ET-1 transcription in endothelial cells was robust and driven primarily by cooperative interactions of the AP-1 and GATA sequences in conjunction with several lesser elements, all of which are located within the first 350 bp 5′-upstream of the start site of transcription.In a previous study from our laboratory (22Strait K.A.

As anticipated from the previous studies cited above, we showed that maximal transcriptional activity of the rat ET-1 promoter in primary cultures of aortic endothelial cells was confined to the first −366 bp of 5′-upstream sequence; additional sequences up to 3.0 kb 5′-upstream produced no further enhancement of promoter activity. However, in similar studies using IMCD cells, we found that the −366-bp region did not produce maximal promoter activity. In IMCD cells, maximal promoter activity (5-fold greater than −366 bp) required additional sequences between 1.0 and 1.7 kb 5′-upstream of the ET-1 transcription start site. The observation that additional regions of the ET-1 promoter are transcriptionally active in IMCD cells may be a reflection of the unique role ET-1 plays in kidney regulation of salt and water homeostasis.In the current studies, we have sought to further characterize the 5′-upstream region of the ET-1 promoter to identify the regulatory elements that appear selectively active in IMCD cells. Deletion analysis identified two regions of the 5′-upstream ET-1 promoter, −1725 to −1319 bp and −1319 to −1026 bp, which were required for maximal promoter activity in IMCD cells. Computer-assisted transcription factor binding site analysis of these regions identified two consensus NFAT binding sites at −1263 and −1563 bp upstream of the start site of transcription. Site-directed mutagenesis of either site produced a significant reduction in ET-1 promoter activity. EMSA analysis showed that both sites were capable of competing for NFAT binding to previously identified NFAT sites in the IL-2 and TNF genes. Finally, gel supershift analysis showed that each of the NFAT binding sites in the ET-1 promoter bind different NFAT isoforms. Thus, NFAT appears to be an important regulator of ET-1 transcription in IMCD cells, and therefore, it may be an important factor in the regulation of renal salt and water balance and blood pressure."
https://openalex.org/W1988985147,"Genomic imprinting of the largest known cluster, the Kcnq1/KCNQ1 domain on mChr7/hChr11, displays significant differences between mouse and man. Of the fourteen transcripts in this cluster, imprinting of six is ubiquitous in mice and humans, however, imprinted expression of the other eight transcripts is only found in the mouse placenta. The human orthologues of the latter eight transcripts are biallelically expressed, at least from the first trimester onwards. However, as early development is less divergent between species, placental specific imprinting may be present in very early gestation in both mice and humans.Human embryonic stem (hES) cells can be differentiated to embryoid bodies and then to trophoblast stem (EB-TS) cells. Using EB-TS cells as a model of post-implantation invading cytotrophoblast, we analysed allelic expression of two telomeric transcripts whose imprinting is placental specific in the mouse, as well as the ncRNA KCNQ1OT1, whose imprinted expression is ubiquitous in early human and mouse development. KCNQ1OT1 expression was monoallelic in all samples but OSBPL5 and NAP1L4 expression was biallelic in EB-TS cells, as well as undifferentiated hES cells and first trimester human fetal placenta. DCN on hChr12, another gene imprinted in the mouse placenta only, was also biallelically expressed in EB-TS cells. The germline maternal methylation imprint at the KvDMR was maintained in both undifferentiated hES cells and EB-TS cells.The question of placental specific imprinting in the human has not been answered fully. Using a model of human trophoblast very early in gestation we show a lack of imprinting of two telomeric genes in the KCNQ1 region and of DCN, whose imprinted expression is placental specific in mice, providing further evidence to suggest that humans do not exhibit placental specific imprinting. The maintenance of both differential methylation of the KvDMR and monoallelic expression of KCNQ1OT1 indicates that the region is appropriately regulated epigenetically in vitro. Human gestational load is less than in the mouse, resulting in reduced need for maternal resource competition, and therefore maybe also a lack of placental specific imprinting. If genomic imprinting exists to control fetal acquisition of maternal resources driven by the placenta, placenta-specific imprinting may be less important in the human than the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W2013126188,"The functional life span of feathers is always much less than the potential life span of birds, so feathers must be renewed regularly. But feather renewal entails important energetic, time and performance costs that must be integrated into the annual cycle. Across species the time required to replace flight feather increases disproportionately with body size, resulting in complex, multiple waves of feather replacement in the primaries of many large birds. We describe the rules of flight feather replacement for Hemiprocne mystacea, a small, 60g tree swift from the New Guinea region. This species breeds and molts in all months of the year, and flight feather molt occurs during breeding in some individuals. H. mystacea is one to be the smallest species for which stepwise replacement of the primaries and secondaries has been documented; yet, primary replacement is extremely slow in this aerial forager, requiring more than 300 days if molt is not interrupted. We used growth bands to show that primaries grow at an average rate of 2.86 mm/d. The 10 primaries are a single molt series, while the 11 secondaries and five rectrices are each broken into two molt series. In large birds stepwise replacement of the primaries serves to increase the rate of primary replacement while minimizing gaps in the wing. But stepwise replacement of the wing quills in H. mystacea proceeds so slowly that it may be a consequence of the ontogeny of stepwise molting, rather than an adaptation, because the average number of growing primaries is probably lower than 1.14 feathers per wing."
https://openalex.org/W1998423514,"Background Except for the ribosomal protein L12 (rplL), ribosomal proteins are present as one copy per ribosome; L12 (rplL) is unusual because it is present as four copies per ribosome. Thus, the strategies used by Mycobacterium fortuitum to regulate ribosomal protein synthesis were investigated, including evaluations of the rates of chain elongations of 16S rRNA, rplL and ribosomal protein S12 (rpsL). Methodology RNA was isolated from cell cultures and cDNA was prepared. The numbers of cDNA copies of 16S rRNA, precursor-16S rRNA and transcripts of rpsL and rplL were quantified by qRT-PCR and then related to the rates of 16S rRNA, rpsL and rplL chain elongations by means of a mathematical framework for coupled transcription/translation. Principal Findings The rates of synthesis of 16S rRNA, rpsL and rplL respectively were found to be approximately 50×103 nucleotides h−1, 1.6×103 amino acid residues h−1 and 3.4×103 amino acid residues h−1. The number of transcripts of rplL was approximately twice that of rpsL. These data account for the presence of one copy of rpsL and four copies of rplL per ribosome, and reveal that the rate of M. fortuitum ribosome synthesis was closer to that of M. tuberculosis than to E. coli. Except for rplJ, the elongation rate obtained for rpsL was inferred to be appropriate for all other proteins present as one copy per ribosome. Significance The results obtained provide the basis for a comprehensive view of the kinetics of ribosome synthesis, and of the ways that bacterial cells utilize genes encoding ribosomal proteins. The methodology also applies to proteins involved in transcription, energy generation and to bacterial proteins in general. The method proposed for measuring the fidelity of cDNA preparations is intrinsically much more sensitive than procedures that measure the integrity of 16S rRNA."
