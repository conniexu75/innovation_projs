https://openalex.org/W2738136165,"The cytoplasmic DNA sensor cGAS detects DNA in ruptured micronuclei and activates an innate immune response. Innate immune activation has been implicated in autoimmunity and cancer. Here, Andrew Jackson and colleagues provide evidence for an underlying mechanism whereby ruptured micronuclei, which result from endogenous or exogenous chromosomal damage, activate a cell-autonomous inflammatory response via the cytoplasmic DNA sensor cGAS. They conclude that cGAS recognition of micronuclei may be acting as a kind of immune surveillance system in cells. Elsewhere in this issue, Roger Greenberg and colleagues report a link between mitosis and DNA-damage-induced inflammatory signalling involving cGAS in cancer cells. DNA is strictly compartmentalized within the nucleus to prevent autoimmunity1; despite this, cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS), a cytosolic sensor of double-stranded DNA, is activated in autoinflammatory disorders and by DNA damage2,3,4,5,6. Precisely how cellular DNA gains access to the cytoplasm remains to be determined. Here, we report that cGAS localizes to micronuclei arising from genome instability in a mouse model of monogenic autoinflammation, after exogenous DNA damage and spontaneously in human cancer cells. Such micronuclei occur after mis-segregation of DNA during cell division and consist of chromatin surrounded by its own nuclear membrane. Breakdown of the micronuclear envelope, a process associated with chromothripsis7, leads to rapid accumulation of cGAS, providing a mechanism by which self-DNA becomes exposed to the cytosol. cGAS is activated by chromatin, and consistent with a mitotic origin, micronuclei formation and the proinflammatory response following DNA damage are cell-cycle dependent. By combining live-cell laser microdissection with single cell transcriptomics, we establish that interferon-stimulated gene expression is induced in micronucleated cells. We therefore conclude that micronuclei represent an important source of immunostimulatory DNA. As micronuclei formed from lagging chromosomes also activate this pathway, recognition of micronuclei by cGAS may act as a cell-intrinsic immune surveillance mechanism that detects a range of neoplasia-inducing processes."
https://openalex.org/W2738446305,"Gravitational microlensing is the only method capable of exploring the entire population of free-floating planets down to Mars-mass objects, because the microlensing signal does not depend on the brightness of the lensing object. A characteristic timescale of microlensing events depends on the mass of the lens: the less massive the lens, the shorter the microlensing event. A previous analysis of 474 microlensing events found an excess of very short events (1-2 days) - more than known stellar populations would suggest - indicating the existence of a large population of unbound or wide-orbit Jupiter-mass planets (reported to be almost twice as common as main-sequence stars). These results, however, do not match predictions of planet formation theories and are in conflict with surveys of young clusters. Here we report the analysis of a six times larger sample of microlensing events discovered during the years 2010-2015. Although our survey has very high sensitivity (detection efficiency) to short-timescale (1--2 days) microlensing events, we found no excess of events with timescales in this range, with a 95% upper limit on the frequency of Jupiter-mass free-floating or wide-orbit planets of 0.25 planet per main-sequence star. We detected a few possible ultrashort-timescale events (with timescales of less than 0.5 day), which may indicate the existence of Earth- and super-Earth-mass free-floating planets, as predicted by planet-formation theories.

https://openalex.org/W2738681903,"Machine learning is becoming a popular and important approach in the field of medical research. In this study, we investigate the relative performance of various machine learning methods such as Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Logistic Model Tree and Random Forests for predicting incident diabetes using medical records of cardiorespiratory fitness. In addition, we apply different techniques to uncover potential predictors of diabetes. This FIT project study used data of 32,555 patients who are free of any known coronary artery disease or heart failure who underwent clinician-referred exercise treadmill stress testing at Henry Ford Health Systems between 1991 and 2009 and had a complete 5-year follow-up. At the completion of the fifth year, 5,099 of those patients have developed diabetes. The dataset contained 62 attributes classified into four categories: demographic characteristics, disease history, medication use history, and stress test vital signs. We developed an Ensembling-based predictive model using 13 attributes that were selected based on their clinical importance, Multiple Linear Regression, and Information Gain Ranking methods. The negative effect of the imbalance class of the constructed model was handled by Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). The overall performance of the predictive model classifier was improved by the Ensemble machine learning approach using the Vote method with three Decision Trees (Naïve Bayes Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Model Tree) and achieved high accuracy of prediction (AUC = 0.92). The study shows the potential of ensembling and SMOTE approaches for predicting incident diabetes using cardiorespiratory fitness data."
https://openalex.org/W2739304139,"Obesity, which is caused by an energy imbalance between calorie intake and consumption, has become a major international health burden. Obesity increases the risk of insulin resistance and age-related cognitive decline, accompanied by peripheral inflammation. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol in green tea, possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cardioprotective activities; however, few reports have focused on its potential effect on cognitive disorders. In this study, our goal was to investigate the protective effects of EGCG treatment on insulin resistance and memory impairment induced by a high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFFD). We randomly assigned 3-mo-old C57BL/6J mice to 3 groups with different diets: control group, HFFD group, and HFFD plus EGCG group. Memory loss was assessed by using the Morris water maze test, during which EGCG was observed to prevent HFFD-elicited memory impairment and neuronal loss. Consistent with these results, EGCG attenuated HFFD-induced neuronal damage. Of note, EGCG significantly ameliorated insulin resistance and cognitive disorder by up-regulating the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)/AKT and ERK/cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathways. Long-term HFFD-triggered neuroinflammation was restored by EGCG supplementation by inhibiting the MAPK and NF-κB pathways, as well as the expression of inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α. EGCG also reversed high glucose and glucosamine-induced insulin resistance in SH-SY5Y neuronal cells by improving the oxidized cellular status and mitochondrial function. To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide compelling evidence that the nutritional compound EGCG has the potential to ameliorate HFFD-triggered learning and memory loss.-Mi, Y., Qi, G., Fan, R., Qiao, Q., Sun, Y., Gao, Y., Liu, X. EGCG ameliorates high-fat- and high-fructose-induced cognitive defects by regulating the IRS/AKT and ERK/CREB/BDNF signaling pathways in the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2736319675,"The fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda, J.E. Smith) is a noctuid moth that is a major and ubiquitous agricultural pest in the Western Hemisphere. Infestations have recently been identified in several locations in Africa, indicating its establishment in the Eastern Hemisphere where it poses an immediate and significant economic threat. Genetic methods were used to characterize noctuid specimens infesting multiple cornfields in the African nation of Togo that were tentatively identified as fall armyworm by morphological criteria. Species identification was confirmed by DNA barcoding and the specimens were found to be primarily of the subgroup that preferentially infests corn and sorghum in the Western Hemisphere. The mitochondrial haplotype configuration was most similar to that found in the Caribbean region and the eastern coast of the United States, identifying these populations as the likely originating source of the Togo infestations. A genetic marker linked with resistance to the Cry1Fa toxin from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) expressed in transgenic corn and common in Puerto Rico fall armyworm populations was not found in the Togo collections. These observations demonstrate the usefulness of genetic surveys to characterize fall armyworm populations from Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2738794771,"Background 
Given the high rate of preterm birth (PTB) nationwide and data from RCTs demonstrating risk reduction with vitamin D supplementation, the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) implemented a new standard of care for pregnant women to receive vitamin D testing and supplementation.


Objectives 
To determine if the reported inverse relationship between maternal 25(OH)D and PTB risk could be replicated at MUSC, an urban medical center treating a large, diverse population.


Methods 
Medical record data were obtained for pregnant patients aged 18–45 years between September 2015 and December 2016. During this time, a protocol that included 25(OH)D testing at first prenatal visit with recommended follow-up testing was initiated. Free vitamin D supplements were offered and the treatment goal was ≥40 ng/mL. PTB rates (<37 weeks) were calculated, and logistic regression and locally weighted regression (LOESS) were used to explore the association between 25(OH)D and PTB. Subgroup analyses were also conducted.


Results 
Among women with a live, singleton birth and at least one 25(OH)D test during pregnancy (N = 1,064), the overall PTB rate was 13%. The LOESS curve showed gestational age rising with increasing 25(OH)D. Women with 25(OH)D ≥40 ng/mL had a 62% lower risk of PTB compared to those <20 ng/mL (p<0.0001). After adjusting for socioeconomic variables, this lower risk remained (OR = 0.41, p = 0.002). Similar decreases in PTB risk were observed for PTB subtypes (spontaneous: 58%, p = 0.02; indicated: 61%, p = 0.006), by race/ethnicity (white: 65%, p = 0.03; non-white: 68%, p = 0.008), and among women with a prior PTB (80%, p = 0.02). Among women with initial 25(OH)D <40 ng/mL, PTB rates were 60% lower for those with ≥40 vs. <40 ng/mL on a follow-up test (p = 0.006); 38% for whites (p = 0.33) and 78% for non-whites (p = 0.01).


Conclusions 
Maternal 25(OH)D concentrations ≥40 ng/mL were associated with substantial reduction in PTB risk in a large, diverse population of women."
https://openalex.org/W2737164296,"Introduction Fluorescence-guided surgery has emerged as a powerful tool to detect, localize and resect tumors in the operative setting. Our laboratory has pioneered a novel way to administer an FDA-approved near-infrared (NIR) contrast agent to help surgeons with this task. This technique, coined Second Window ICG, exploits the natural permeability of tumor vasculature and its poor clearance to deliver high doses of indocyanine green (ICG) to tumors. This technique differs substantially from established ICG video angiography techniques that visualize ICG within minutes of injection. We hypothesized that Second Window ICG can provide NIR optical contrast with good signal characteristics in intracranial brain tumors over a longer period of time than previously appreciated with ICG video angiography alone. We tested this hypothesis in an intracranial mouse glioblastoma model, and corroborated this in a human clinical trial. Methods Intracranial tumors were established in 20 mice using the U251-Luc-GFP cell line. Successful grafts were confirmed with bioluminescence. Intravenous tail vein injections of 5.0 mg/kg (high dose) or 2.5 mg/kg (low dose) ICG were performed. The Perkin Elmer IVIS Spectrum (closed field) was used to visualize NIR fluorescence signal at seven delayed time points following ICG injection. NIR signals were quantified using LivingImage software. Based on the success of our results, human subjects were recruited to a clinical trial and intravenously injected with high dose 5.0 mg/kg. Imaging was performed with the VisionSense Iridium (open field) during surgery one day after ICG injection. Results In the murine model, the NIR signal-to-background ratio (SBR) in gliomas peaks at one hour after infusion, then plateaus and remains strong and stable for at least 48 hours. Higher dose 5.0 mg/kg improves NIR signal as compared to lower dose at 2.5 mg/kg (SBR = 3.5 vs. 2.8; P = 0.0624). Although early (≤ 6 hrs) visualization of the Second Window ICG accumulation in gliomas is stronger than late (≥24 hrs) visualization (SBR = 3.94 vs. 2.32; p<0.05) there appears to be a long plateau period of stable ICG NIR signal accumulation within tumors in the murine model. We call this long plateau period the “Second Window” of ICG. In glioblastoma patients, the delayed visualization of intratumoral NIR signal was strong (SBR 7.50 ± 0.74), without any significant difference within the 19 to 30 hour visualization window (R2 = 0.019). Conclusion The Second Window ICG technique allows neurosurgeons to deliver NIR optical contrast agent to human glioblastoma patients, thus providing real-time tumor identification in the operating room. This nonspecific tumor accumulation of ICG within the tumor provides strong signal to background contrast, and is not significantly time dependent between 6 hours to 48 hours, providing a broad plateau for stable visualization. This finding suggests that optimal imaging of the “Second Window of ICG” may be within this plateau period, thus providing signal uniformity across subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2738273874,"Bootstrap methods are widely used in statistics, and bootstrapping of residuals can be especially useful in the regression context. However, difficulties are encountered extending residual resampling to regression settings where residuals are not identically distributed (thus not amenable to bootstrapping)-common examples including logistic or Poisson regression and generalizations to handle clustered or multivariate data, such as generalised estimating equations. We propose a bootstrap method based on probability integral transform (PIT-) residuals, which we call the PIT-trap, which assumes data come from some marginal distribution F of known parametric form. This method can be understood as a type of ""model-free bootstrap"", adapted to the problem of discrete and highly multivariate data. PIT-residuals have the key property that they are (asymptotically) pivotal. The PIT-trap thus inherits the key property, not afforded by any other residual resampling approach, that the marginal distribution of data can be preserved under PIT-trapping. This in turn enables the derivation of some standard bootstrap properties, including second-order correctness of pivotal PIT-trap test statistics. In multivariate data, bootstrapping rows of PIT-residuals affords the property that it preserves correlation in data without the need for it to be modelled, a key point of difference as compared to a parametric bootstrap. The proposed method is illustrated on an example involving multivariate abundance data in ecology, and demonstrated via simulation to have improved properties as compared to competing resampling methods."
https://openalex.org/W2736345178,"Background Late-onset preeclampsia is the most prevalent phenotype of this syndrome; nevertheless, only a few biomarkers for its early diagnosis have been reported. We sought to correct this deficiency using a high through-put proteomic platform. Methods A case-control longitudinal study was conducted, including 90 patients with normal pregnancies and 76 patients with late-onset preeclampsia (diagnosed at ≥34 weeks of gestation). Maternal plasma samples were collected throughout gestation (normal pregnancy: 2–6 samples per patient, median of 2; late-onset preeclampsia: 2–6, median of 5). The abundance of 1,125 proteins was measured using an aptamers-based proteomics technique. Protein abundance in normal pregnancies was modeled using linear mixed-effects models to estimate mean abundance as a function of gestational age. Data was then expressed as multiples of-the-mean (MoM) values in normal pregnancies. Multi-marker prediction models were built using data from one of five gestational age intervals (8–16, 16.1–22, 22.1–28, 28.1–32, 32.1–36 weeks of gestation). The predictive performance of the best combination of proteins was compared to placental growth factor (PIGF) using bootstrap. Results 1) At 8–16 weeks of gestation, the best prediction model included only one protein, matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP-7), that had a sensitivity of 69% at a false positive rate (FPR) of 20% (AUC = 0.76); 2) at 16.1–22 weeks of gestation, MMP-7 was the single best predictor of late-onset preeclampsia with a sensitivity of 70% at a FPR of 20% (AUC = 0.82); 3) after 22 weeks of gestation, PlGF was the best predictor of late-onset preeclampsia, identifying 1/3 to 1/2 of the patients destined to develop this syndrome (FPR = 20%); 4) 36 proteins were associated with late-onset preeclampsia in at least one interval of gestation (after adjustment for covariates); 5) several biological processes, such as positive regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling pathway, were perturbed; and 6) from 22.1 weeks of gestation onward, the set of proteins most predictive of severe preeclampsia was different from the set most predictive of the mild form of this syndrome. Conclusions Elevated MMP-7 early in gestation (8–22 weeks) and low PlGF later in gestation (after 22 weeks) are the strongest predictors for the subsequent development of late-onset preeclampsia, suggesting that the optimal identification of patients at risk may involve a two-step diagnostic process."

https://openalex.org/W2737143330,"Loss and fragmentation of natural habitats caused by human land uses have subdivided several formerly contiguous large carnivore populations into multiple small and often isolated subpopulations, which can reduce genetic variation and lead to precipitous population declines. Substantial habitat loss and fragmentation from urban development and agriculture expansion relegated the Highlands-Glades subpopulation (HGS) of Florida, USA, black bears (Ursus americanus floridanus) to prolonged isolation; increasing human land development is projected to cause ≥ 50% loss of remaining natural habitats occupied by the HGS in coming decades. We conducted a noninvasive genetic spatial capture-recapture study to quantitatively describe the degree of contemporary habitat fragmentation and investigate the consequences of habitat fragmentation on population density and genetics of the HGS. Remaining natural habitats sustaining the HGS were significantly more fragmented and patchier than those supporting Florida’s largest black bear subpopulation. Genetic diversity was low (AR = 3.57; HE = 0.49) and effective population size was small (NE = 25 bears), both of which remained unchanged over a period spanning one bear generation despite evidence of some immigration. Subpopulation density (0.054 bear/km2) was among the lowest reported for black bears, was significantly female-biased, and corresponded to a subpopulation size of 98 bears in available habitat. Conserving remaining natural habitats in the area occupied by the small, genetically depauperate HGS, possibly through conservation easements and government land acquisition, is likely the most important immediate step to ensuring continued persistence of bears in this area. Our study also provides evidence that preferentially placing detectors (e.g., hair traps or cameras) primarily in quality habitat across fragmented landscapes poses a challenge to estimating density-habitat covariate relationships using spatial capture-recapture models. Because habitat fragmentation and loss are likely to increase in severity globally, further investigation of the influence of habitat fragmentation and detector placement on estimation of this relationship is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2738819725,"Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease characterized by decreased bone density and strength due to excessive loss of bone protein and mineral content. The imbalance between osteogenesis by osteoblasts and osteoclastogenesis by osteoclasts contributes to the pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Estrogen withdrawal leads to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Overactivated osteoclasts by inflammation play a vital role in the imbalance. Matrine is an alkaloid found in plants from the Sophora genus with various pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory activity. Here we demonstrate that matrine significantly prevented ovariectomy-induced bone loss and inhibited osteoclastogenesis in vivo with decreased serum levels of TRAcp5b, TNF-α, and IL-6. In vitro matrine significantly inhibited osteoclast differentiation induced by receptor activator for NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and M-CSF in bone marrow monocytes and RAW264.7 cells as demonstrated by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and actin-ring formation as well as bone resorption through pit formation assays. For molecular mechanisms, matrine abrogated RANKL-induced activation of NF-κB, AKT, and MAPK pathways and suppressed osteoclastogenesis-related marker expression, including matrix metalloproteinase 9, NFATc1, TRAP, C-Src, and cathepsin K. Our study demonstrates that matrine inhibits osteoclastogenesis through modulation of multiple pathways and that matrine is a promising agent in the treatment of osteoclast-related diseases such as osteoporosis.—Chen, X., Zhi, X., Pan, P., Cui, J., Cao, L., Weng, W., Zhou, Q., Wang, L., Zhai, X.

https://openalex.org/W2737043580,"Dysfunctional mitochondria and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) promote chronic diseases, which have spurred interest in the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions. Previously, we have demonstrated that disruption of post-translational modification of proteins with β-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAcylation) via overexpression of the O-GlcNAc-regulating enzymes O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) or O-GlcNAcase (OGA) impairs mitochondrial function. Here, we report that sustained alterations in O-GlcNAcylation either by pharmacological or genetic manipulation also alter metabolic function. Sustained O-GlcNAc elevation in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells increased OGA expression and reduced cellular respiration and ROS generation. Cells with elevated O-GlcNAc levels had elongated mitochondria and increased mitochondrial membrane potential, and RNA-sequencing analysis indicated transcriptome reprogramming and down-regulation of the NRF2-mediated antioxidant response. Sustained O-GlcNAcylation in mouse brain and liver validated the metabolic phenotypes observed in the cells, and OGT knockdown in the liver elevated ROS levels, impaired respiration, and increased the NRF2 antioxidant response. Moreover, elevated O-GlcNAc levels promoted weight loss and lowered respiration in mice and skewed the mice toward carbohydrate-dependent metabolism as determined by indirect calorimetry. In summary, sustained elevation in O-GlcNAcylation coupled with increased OGA expression reprograms energy metabolism, a finding that has potential implications for the etiology, development, and management of metabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2737745629,"Objective The aim of the trial was to determine the effectiveness of oxygen-ozone injections on knee osteoarthritis concerning pain reduction, joint functional improvement, and quality of life. Methods In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial, 98 patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA) were randomized into two groups receiving intra-articular 20 μg/ml of ozone (OZ) or placebo (PBO) for 8 weeks. The efficacy outcomes for knee OA were the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Lequesne Index, Timed Up and Go Test (TUG Test), SF-36, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and Geriatric Pain Measure (GPM). Results After 8 weeks of treatment, ozone was more effective than the placebo: VAS [mean difference (MD) = 2.16, p < 0.003 (CI 95% 0.42–3.89)], GPM [MD = 18.94, p < 0.004 (CI 95% 3.43–34.44)], LEQ [MD = 4.05, p < 0.001 (CI 95% 1.10–7.00)], WOMAC (P) [median of diff = 9.999, p = 0.019 (CI 95% 0.000–15.000)], WOMAC (JS) [median of diff = 12.499, p < 0.001 (CI 95% 0.000–12.500)], WOMAC (PF) = [median of diff = 11.760, p = 0.003 (CI 95% 4.409–19.119)], TUG (no statistical difference) and SF-36 (FC) [(MD = -25.82, p < 0.001 (CI 95% 33.65–17.99)], SF-36 (PH) [MD = -40.82, p < 0.001 (CI 95% -54.48–27.17)], SF-36 (GSH) [MD = -3.38, p < 0.001 (CI 95% -4.83–1.93)], SF-36 (SA) [MD = 2.17, p < 0.001 (CI 95% -19.67–8.24), SF-36 (EA) [MD = -35.37, p < 0.001 (CI 95% -48.86–21.89)]. Adverse events occurred in 3 patients (2 in the placebo group and 1 in the ozone group) and included only puncture accidents. Conclusions The study confirms the efficacy of ozone concerning pain relief, functional improvement, and quality of life in patients with knee osteoarthritis.

https://openalex.org/W2737033892,"Hippo pathway transcriptional coactivators TAZ and YAP and the TGF-β1 (TGFβ) effector Smad3 regulate a common set of genes, can physically interact, and exhibit multilevel cross-talk regulating cell fate-determining and fibrogenic pathways. However, a key aspect of this cross-talk, TGFβ-mediated regulation of TAZ or YAP expression, remains uncharacterized. Here, we show that TGFβ induces robust TAZ but not YAP protein expression in both mesenchymal and epithelial cells. TAZ levels, and to a lesser extent YAP levels, also increased during experimental kidney fibrosis. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of Smad3 did not prevent the TGFβ-induced TAZ up-regulation, indicating that this canonical pathway is dispensable. In contrast, inhibition of p38 MAPK, its downstream effector MK2 (e.g. by the clinically approved antifibrotic pirferidone), or Akt suppressed the TGFβ-induced TAZ expression. Moreover, TGFβ elevated TAZ mRNA in a p38-dependent manner. Myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF) was a central mediator of this effect, as MRTF silencing/inhibition abolished the TGFβ-induced TAZ expression. MRTF overexpression drove the TAZ promoter in a CC(A/T-rich)6GG (CArG) box-dependent manner and induced TAZ protein expression. TGFβ did not act by promoting nuclear MRTF translocation; instead, it triggered p38- and MK2-mediated, Nox4-promoted MRTF phosphorylation and activation. Functionally, higher TAZ levels increased TAZ/TEAD-dependent transcription and primed cells for enhanced TAZ activity upon a second stimulus (i.e. sphingosine 1-phosphate) that induced nuclear TAZ translocation. In conclusion, our results uncover an important aspect of the cross-talk between TGFβ and Hippo signaling, showing that TGFβ induces TAZ via a Smad3-independent, p38- and MRTF-mediated and yet MRTF translocation-independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2739447778,"Sleep is critical for repair as well as the rejuvenation processes in the body and many of these functions are regulated via underlying cellular metabolic homeostasis. Changes in sleep pattern are reported to alter such metabolic function resulting in altered disease susceptibility or behavior. Here, we measured the extent to which overnight total sleep deprivation (SD) in young adult humans can influence systemic (plasma-derived) redox-metabolism including the major antioxidant, glutathione as well as DNA methylation levels. Nineteen participants (n = 19, μ age = 21, SD = 3.09) underwent morning testing before and after overnight total SD. Biochemical measures before and after SD revealed that glutathione, ATP, cysteine, and homocysteine levels were significantly reduced following one night of sleep deprivation (all p's < 0.01). Parallel to the well-recognized fact that sleep deprivation (maintaining wakefulness) uses up metabolic reserves, we observed that morning cortisol levels were blunted after sleep deprivation. There were no significant correlations between self-reported or actigraphy-measured sleep and the biochemical measurements, strongly indicating that prior sleep behavior did not have any direct influence on the biochemical measures taken at baseline or after sleep deprivation. Results from the current investigation supports the previous literature implicating the induction of oxidative stress and ATP depletion with sleep deprivation. Furthermore, such altered antioxidant status can also induce downstream epigenetic changes. Although we did not measure the specific genes that were altered under the influence of such sleep deprivation, such epigenetic changes could potentially contribute towards disease predisposition."
https://openalex.org/W2738806151,"Leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) is a bona fide marker of adult stem cells in several epithelial tissues, most notably in the intestinal crypts, and is highly up-regulated in many colorectal, hepatocellular, and ovarian cancers. LGR5 activation by R-spondin (RSPO) ligands potentiates Wnt/β-catenin signaling in vitro; however, deletion of LGR5 in stem cells has little or no effect on Wnt/β-catenin signaling or cell proliferation in vivo Remarkably, modulation of LGR5 expression has a major impact on the actin cytoskeletal structure and cell adhesion in the absence of RSPO stimulation, but the molecular mechanism is unclear. Here, we show that LGR5 interacts with IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), an effector of Rac1/CDC42 GTPases, in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell-cell adhesion. Specifically, LGR5 decreased levels of IQGAP1 phosphorylation at Ser-1441/1443, leading to increased binding of Rac1 to IQGAP1 and thus higher levels of cortical F-actin and enhanced cell-cell adhesion. LGR5 ablation in colon cancer cells and crypt stem cells resulted in loss of cortical F-actin, reduced cell-cell adhesion, and disrupted localization of adhesion-associated proteins. No evidence of LGR5 coupling to any of the four major subtypes of heterotrimeric G proteins was found. These findings suggest that LGR5 primarily functions via the IQGAP1-Rac1 pathway to strengthen cell-cell adhesion in normal adult crypt stem cells and colon cancer cells."

The high reliability of this method has been already demonstrated, in clinical microbiology, by a number of studies showing high attribution concordance with other credited analyses. Recently, it has been employed also in other branches of microbiology with controversial performance. The phyloproteomic results reported in this study were validated with those obtained by the “gold standard” 16S rDNA analysis. Concordance between the two methods was 100% at the genus level, while at the species level it was 48%. These percentages appeared to be quite high compared with other studies regarding environmental bacteria. However, the performance of MALDI BioTyper changed in relation to the taxonomical group analyzed, reflecting known identification problems related to certain genera. In our case, attribution concordance for Pseudomonas species was rather low (29%), confirming the problematic taxonomy of this genus, whereas that of strains from other genera was quite high (> 60%). Among the isolates tested in this study, two strains (Exiguobacterium oxidotolerans and Pseudomonas costantinii) were misidentified by MALDI BioTyper due to absence of reference spectra in the database. Accordingly, missing spectra were acquired for the database implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2737631629,"It is now recognized that several rounds of whole genome duplication (WGD) have occurred during the evolution of vertebrates, but the link between WGDs and phenotypic diversification remains unsolved. We have investigated in this study the impact of the teleost-specific WGD on the evolution of the sox gene family in teleostean fishes. The sox gene family, which encodes for transcription factors, has essential role in morphology, physiology and behavior of vertebrates and teleosts, the current largest group of vertebrates. We have first redrawn the evolution of all sox genes identified in eleven teleost genomes using a comparative genomic approach including phylogenetic and synteny analyses. We noticed, compared to tetrapods, an important expansion of the sox family: 58% (11/19) of sox genes are duplicated in teleost genomes. Furthermore, all duplicated sox genes, except sox17 paralogs, are derived from the teleost-specific WGD. Then, focusing on five sox genes, analyzing the evolution of coding and non-coding sequences, as well as the expression patterns in fish embryos and adult tissues, we demonstrated that these paralogs followed lineage-specific evolutionary trajectories in teleost genomes. This work, based on whole genome data from multiple teleostean species, supports the contribution of WGDs to the expansion of gene families, as well as to the emergence of genomic differences between lineages that might promote genetic and phenotypic diversity in teleosts."
https://openalex.org/W2738330713,"Objectives The relationship between body mass index (BMI) with mortality risk, in particular the BMI category associated with the lowest all-cause and CVD-and-stroke mortality and the BMI threshold for defining overweight or obesity in older persons is controversial. This study investigated the age-dependent associations of BMI categories with all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke mortality. Method Prospective cohort study (Singapore Longitudinal Ageing Studies) of older adults aged 55 and above, followed up from 2003 to 2011. Participants were 2605 Chinese with baseline BMI and other variables. Outcome Measurement: Mortality hazard ratios (HR) for all-cause and CVD and stroke mortality. Results Overall, BMI showed a U-shaped relationship with all-cause and CVD and stroke mortality, being lowest at Normal Weight-II category (BMI 23.0–24.9 kg/m2). Most evidently among the middle-aged (55–64 years), all-cause mortality risks relative to Normal Weight-II were elevated for underweight (<BMI 18.5; HR = 4.92, p<0.0138), Normal Weight-I (BMI 18.5–22.9; HR = 3.41, p = 0.0149), and Overweight-Obese (BMI>30.0; HR = 4.05,p = 0.0423). Among the old (≥65 years), however, Overweight and Obese categories were not significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality (HR from 0.98 to 1.29), but Overweight-Obese was associated with increased CVD and stroke mortality (HR = 10.0, p = 0.0086). Conclusion BMI showed a U-shaped relationship with mortality. Among older persons aged 65 and above, the overweight-or-obese category of BMI was not associated with excess all-cause mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2739350124,"Questionnaires or computer-based tests for assessing activities of daily living are well-known approaches to screen for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, questionnaires are subjective and computerized tests only collect simple performance data with conventional input devices such as a mouse and keyboard. This study explored the validity and discriminative power of a virtual daily living test as a new diagnostic approach to assess MCI. Twenty-two healthy controls and 20 patients with MCI were recruited. The virtual daily living test presents two complex daily living tasks in an immersive virtual reality environment. The tasks were conducted based on subject body movements and detailed behavioral data (i.e., kinematic measures) were collected. Performance in both the proposed virtual daily living test and conventional neuropsychological tests for patients with MCI was compared to healthy controls. Kinematic measures considered in this study, such as body movement trajectory, time to completion, and speed, classified patients with MCI from healthy controls, F(8, 33) = 5.648, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.578. When both hand and head speed were employed in conjunction with the immediate free-recall test, a conventional neuropsychological test, the discrimination power for screening MCI was significantly improved to 90% sensitivity and 95.5% specificity (cf. the immediate free-recall test alone has 80% sensitivity and 77.3% specificity). Inclusion of the kinematic measures in screening for MCI significantly improved the classification of patients with MCI compared to the healthy control group, Wilks’ Lambda = 0.451, p < 0.001."
https://openalex.org/W2737925905,"Inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) may improve plant performance at disturbed sites, but inoculation may also suppress root colonization by native AMF and decrease the diversity of the root-colonizing AMF community. This has been shown for the roots of directly inoculated plants, but little is known about the stability of inoculation effects, and to which degree the inoculant and the inoculation-induced changes in AMF community composition spread into newly emerging seedlings that were not in direct contact with the introduced propagules. We addressed this topic in a greenhouse experiment based on the soil and native AMF community of a post-mining site. Plants were cultivated in compartmented pots with substrate containing the native AMF community, where AMF extraradical mycelium radiating from directly inoculated plants was allowed to inoculate neighboring plants. The abundances of the inoculated isolate and of native AMF taxa were monitored in the roots of the directly inoculated plants and the neighboring plants by quantitative real-time PCR. As expected, inoculation suppressed root colonization of the directly inoculated plants by other AMF taxa of the native AMF community and also by native genotypes of the same species as used for inoculation. In the neighboring plants, high abundance of the inoculant and the suppression of native AMF were maintained. Thus, we demonstrate that inoculation effects on native AMF propagate into plants that were not in direct contact with the introduced inoculum, and are therefore likely to persist at the site of inoculation."
https://openalex.org/W2739081837,"Chlamydia is a prevalent sexually transmitted disease that infects more than 100 million people worldwide. Although most individuals infected with Chlamydia trachomatis are initially asymptomatic, symptoms can arise if left undiagnosed. Long-term infection can result in debilitating conditions such as pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and blindness. Chlamydia infection, therefore, constitutes a significant public health threat, underscoring the need for a Chlamydia-specific vaccine. Chlamydia strains express a major outer-membrane protein (MOMP) that has been shown to be an effective vaccine antigen. However, approaches to produce a functional recombinant MOMP protein for vaccine development are limited by poor solubility, low yield, and protein misfolding. Here, we used an Escherichia coli-based cell-free system to express a MOMP protein from the mouse-specific species Chlamydia muridarum (MoPn-MOMP or mMOMP). The codon-optimized mMOMP gene was co-translated with Δ49apolipoprotein A1 (Δ49ApoA1), a truncated version of mouse ApoA1 in which the N-terminal 49 amino acids were removed. This co-translation process produced mMOMP supported within a telodendrimer nanolipoprotein particle (mMOMP-tNLP). The cell-free expressed mMOMP-tNLPs contain mMOMP multimers similar to the native MOMP protein. This cell-free process produced on average 1.5 mg of purified, water-soluble mMOMP-tNLP complex in a 1-ml cell-free reaction. The mMOMP-tNLP particle also accommodated the co-localization of CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 1826, a single-stranded synthetic DNA adjuvant, eliciting an enhanced humoral immune response in vaccinated mice. Using our mMOMP-tNLP formulation, we demonstrate a unique approach to solubilizing and administering membrane-bound proteins for future vaccine development. This method can be applied to other previously difficult-to-obtain antigens while maintaining full functionality and immunogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2737751938,"Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is an autosomal dominant inheritable skeletal disorder characterized by cranial dysplasia, clavicle hypoplasia and dental abnormalities. This disease is mainly caused by heterozygous mutations in RUNX2, a gene that encodes an osteoblast-specific transcription factor. In the present study, mutational analyses of RUNX2 gene were performed on four unrelated Chinese patients with CCD. Four different RUNX2 mutations were detected in these patients, including one nonsense mutation (c.199C>T p.Q67X) and three missense mutations (c.338T>G p.L113R, c.557G>C p.R186T and c.673C>T p.R225W). Among them, two mutations (c.199C>T p.Q67X and c.557G>C p.R186T) were novel and the other two had been reported in previous literatures. Except for Q67X mutation located in the Q/A domain, other three mutations were clustered within the highly conserved Runt domain. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and RUNX2 fusion protein analyses in vitro showed that nuclear accumulation of RUNX2 protein was disturbed by Q67X mutation, while the other two mutations (c.338T>G p.L113R and c.557G>C p.R186T) had no effects on the subcellular distribution of RUNX2. Luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that all the three novel RUNX2 mutations significantly reduced the transactivation activity of RUNX2 on osteocalcin promoter. Our findings enrich the evidence of molecular genetics that the mutations of RUNX2 gene are responsible for CCD."
https://openalex.org/W2738215485,"Controlled release urea (CRU) has been widely adopted to increase nitrogen (N) use efficiency and maize production, but the impacts can range widely depending on water availability in the soil. In an experiment using Zhengdan 958 (a popular summer maize hybrid), three levels of water treatments (adequate water condition [W3], which maintained soil moisture at about 75% ± 5% of the soil’s field capacity; mild water stress [W2], which maintained moisture content at 55% ± 5% of field capacity; and severe water stress [W1], which had a moisture content of 35% ± 5% of field capacity) and four levels of controlled release urea fertilizer (N0, N1, N2 and N3 were 0, 105, 210 and 315 kg N ha–1, respectively) were compared in a rainout shelter system with soil. The results revealed that CRU had significant effects on maize yields and N use efficiencies under different water conditions. The mean yields increased with increasing water levels and showed significant differences. Under W1, the accumulation of dry matter and N were limited, and N internal efficiency (NIE) and the apparent recovery efficiency of applied N (REN) decreased with N increases; yields of N1, N2, and N3 were similar. Under W2, the dry matter and N accumulation, as well as the yield, showed an increasing trend with an increase in N application, and the NIE and REN of N3 showed no difference from N2. Under W3, yields of N2 and N3 were similar and they were significantly higher than that of N1, but the agronomic N use efficiency (ANUE), REN, and the physiological NUE (PNUE) of N2 were 54.2, 34.9, and 14.4% higher, respectively, than those of N3. N application beyond the optimal N rate did not consistently increase maize yield, and caused a decrease in N use efficiencies. Highest overall dry matter, N accumulation, and yields were observed with N3 under W2, and those showed no differences with N2 and N3 under W3. Under this experimental condition, the CRU of 210 kg ha–1 was optimized when soil moisture content was 75% ± 5% of field capacity, but an N rate of 315 kg ha–1 was superior when soil moisture content during the entire growing season was maintained at 55% ± 5% of field capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2738247240,"Modeling the magnitude and distribution of sediment-bound pollutants in estuaries is often limited by incomplete knowledge of the site and inadequate sample density. To address these modeling limitations, a decision-support tool framework was conceived that predicts sediment contamination from the sub-estuary to broader estuary extent. For this study, a Random Forest (RF) model was implemented to predict the distribution of a model contaminant, triclosan (5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol) (TCS), in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA. TCS is an unregulated contaminant used in many personal care products. The RF explanatory variables were associated with TCS transport and fate (proxies) and direct and indirect environmental entry. The continuous RF TCS concentration predictions were discretized into three levels of contamination (low, medium, and high) for three different quantile thresholds. The RF model explained 63% of the variance with a minimum number of variables. Total organic carbon (TOC) (transport and fate proxy) was a strong predictor of TCS contamination causing a mean squared error increase of 59% when compared to permutations of randomized values of TOC. Additionally, combined sewer overflow discharge (environmental entry) and sand (transport and fate proxy) were strong predictors. The discretization models identified a TCS area of greatest concern in the northern reach of Narragansett Bay (Providence River sub-estuary), which was validated with independent test samples. This decision-support tool performed well at the sub-estuary extent and provided the means to identify areas of concern and prioritize bay-wide sampling."
https://openalex.org/W2737164147,"Objective To assess whether women with a history of preterm birth, independent on the presence of prelabour rupture of the membranes (PROM) and growth deviation of the newborn, are more likely to develop preeclampsia with preterm or preterm birth in a subsequent pregnancy. Methods We conducted a population-based cohort study, based on Medical Birth Registry of Norway between 1967 and 2012, including 742,980 women with singleton pregnancies who were followed up from their 1st to 2nd pregnancy. In the analyses we included 712,511 women after excluding 30,469 women with preeclampsia in the first pregnancy. Results After preterm birth without preeclampsia in the first pregnancy, the risk of preterm preeclampsia in the second pregnancy was 4–7 fold higher than after term birth (odds ratios 3.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.0–4.0 to 6.5; 95% CI 5.1–8.2). The risk of term preeclampsia in the pregnancy following a preterm birth was 2–3 times higher than after term birth (odds ratios 1.6; 95% CI 1.5–1.8 to 2.6; 95% CI 2.0–3.4). After spontaneous non-PROM preterm birth and preterm PROM, the risk of preterm preeclampsia was 3.3–3.6 fold higher than after spontaneous term birth. Corresponding risks of term preeclampsia was 1.6–1.8 fold higher. No significant time trends were found in the effect of spontaneous preterm birth in the first pregnancy on preterm or term preeclampsia in the second pregnancy. Conclusions The results suggest that preterm birth, regardless of the presence of PROM, and preeclampsia share pathophysiologic mechanisms. These mechanisms may cause preterm birth in one pregnancy and preeclampsia in a subsequent pregnancy in the same woman. The association was particularly evident with preterm preeclampsia."

The purpose of our study was to determine whether such activation may depend on redox-sensing cysteines within p38α. p38α was activated and formed a disulfide-bound heterodimer with MAP2K3 (MKK3) in rat cardiomyocytes and isolated hearts exposed to H2O2. This disulfide heterodimer was sensitive to reduction by mercaptoethanol and was enhanced by the thioredoxin-reductase inhibitor auranofin. We predicted that Cys-119 or Cys-162 of p38α, close to the known MKK3 docking domain, were relevant for these redox characteristics. The C119S mutation decreased whereas the C162S mutation increased the dimer formation, suggesting that these two Cys residues act as vicinal thiols, consistent with C119S/C162S being incapable of sensing H2O2. Similarly, disulfide heterodimer formation was abolished in H9C2 cells expressing both MKK3 and p38α C119S/C162S and subjected to simulated ischemia and reperfusion. However, the p38α C119S/C162S mutants did not exhibit appreciable alteration in activating dual phosphorylation. In contrast, the anti-inflammatory agent 10-nitro-oleic acid (NO2-OA), a component of the Mediterranean diet, reduced p38α activation and covalently modified Cys-119/Cys-162, probably obstructing MKK3 access. Moreover, NO2-OA reduced the dephosphorylation of p38α by hematopoietic tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP). Furthermore, steric obstruction of Cys-119/Cys-162 by NO2-OA pretreatment in Langendorff-perfused murine hearts prevented the p38-MKK3 disulfide dimer formation and attenuated H2O2-induced contractile dysfunction.

https://openalex.org/W2738090131,"Despite its relatively streamlined genome, there are many important examples of regulated RNA splicing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we report a role for the chromatin remodeler SWI/SNF in respiration, partially via the regulation of splicing. We find that a nutrient-dependent decrease in Snf2 leads to an increase in splicing of the PTC7 transcript. The spliced PTC7 transcript encodes a mitochondrial phosphatase regulator of biosynthesis of coenzyme Q6 (ubiquinone or CoQ6) and a mitochondrial redox-active lipid essential for electron and proton transport in respiration. Increased splicing of PTC7 increases CoQ6 levels. The increase in PTC7 splicing occurs at least in part due to down-regulation of ribosomal protein gene expression, leading to the redistribution of spliceosomes from this abundant class of intron-containing RNAs to otherwise poorly spliced transcripts. In contrast, a protein encoded by the nonspliced isoform of PTC7 represses CoQ6 biosynthesis. Taken together, these findings uncover a link between Snf2 expression and the splicing of PTC7 and establish a previously unknown role for the SWI/SNF complex in the transition of yeast cells from fermentative to respiratory modes of metabolism.

Similar to other eukaryotic genomes, genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae may be interrupted by non-coding sequences, called introns. Introns are removed from the pre-mRNA through the action of the spliceosome, a macromolecular machine composed of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins. The spliceosome recognizes consensus sequence signals on the pre-mRNA, termed splice sites, by which it subsequently binds to the intron and catalyzes its removal via two transesterification reactions (1.Naftelberg S. Schor I.E. Ast G. Kornblihtt A.R. Regulation of alternative splicing through coupling with transcription and chromatin structure.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2015; 84: 165-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Pre-mRNA splicing is critical for accurate gene expression in all eukaryotes, and there is significant evidence that alterations in microenvironments, such as changes in the chromatin state or chromatin-modifying factors, can affect splicing outcomes (1.Naftelberg S. Schor I.E. Ast G. Kornblihtt A.R. Regulation of alternative splicing through coupling with transcription and chromatin structure.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2015; 84: 165-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms for how chromatin and chromatin factors influence splicing are not completely understood. Although the genome of S. cerevisiae contains a smaller number of introns than metazoan genomes, there are, nonetheless, numerous examples of intron-dependent gene regulation (2.Johnson T.L. Vilardell J. Regulated pre-mRNA splicing: the ghostwriter of the eukaryotic genome.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1819: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The largest functional class of intron-containing genes (ICGs) 4The abbreviations used are: ICG, intron-containing gene; RPG, ribosomal protein gene; ns, non-spliced; s, spliced; CoQ, coenzyme Q; DMQ6, 5-demethoxy-Q6; 4HB, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid; HHB, 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid; qPCR, quantitative PCR; TOR, target of rapamycin. 4The abbreviations used are: ICG, intron-containing gene; RPG, ribosomal protein gene; ns, non-spliced; s, spliced; CoQ, coenzyme Q; DMQ6, 5-demethoxy-Q6; 4HB, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid; HHB, 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid; qPCR, quantitative PCR; TOR, target of rapamycin. in budding yeast is ribosomal protein genes (RPGs) that encode the protein components of the ribosome. Therefore, the energy-intensive process of translation is under the heavy regulatory control of the spliceosome, such that splicing of RPGs can be finely tuned to the cells' environmental conditions and to nutrient availability (3.Pleiss J.A. Whitworth G.B. Bergkessel M. Guthrie C. Rapid, transcript-specific changes in splicing in response to environmental stress.Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 928-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this enrichment of introns within RPGs impacts the splicing of, as well as provides an opportunity for the regulation of, other ICGs within the yeast genome. About a third of yeast introns occur in RPGs, and the high transcription levels of these genes means that about 90% of the intron load encountered by the spliceosome is from this one functional class of genes (4.Ares Jr., M. Grate L. Pauling M.H. An handful of intron-containing genes produces the lion's share of yeast mRNA.RNA. 1999; 5: 1138-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Indeed, the prevalence of RPG introns functions to titrate spliceosomes away from other introns, especially those containing suboptimal splice sites. Conversely, down-regulating RPG expression promotes the splicing of transcripts harboring suboptimal splice sites. This effect is perhaps best described during the process of yeast meiosis. Under conditions of vegetative growth, a number of meiosis-specific ICGs are expressed, but they possess suboptimal splice sites and are therefore poorly recognized by the spliceosome and suboptimally spliced. However, upon the down-regulation of RPGs during meiosis, increased availability of the previously limiting pool of spliceosomes leads to improved splicing efficiency of introns in meiosis-specific transcripts (5.Munding E.M.

There are other important examples of intron-based regulation in S. cerevisiae, especially among ICGs with non-consensus splice sites (7.Hossain M.A. Claggett J.M. Edwards S.R. Shi A. Pennebaker S.L.

Key features of the two-intron Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene SUS1 contribute to its alternative splicing.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 8612-8627Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). One such gene is PTC7, which encodes a Mg2+/Mn2+-dependent, type 2C serine/threonine protein phosphatase (9.Jiang L. Whiteway M. Ramos C.W. Rodriguez-Medina J.R. Shen S.-H. The YHR076W gene encodes a type 2C protein phosphatase and represents the seventh PP2C gene in budding yeast.FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 323-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The intron within PTC7 is particularly intriguing because it contains a non-consensus branch-point sequence, rendering its splicing relatively inefficient under logarithmic growth conditions. The PTC7 intron lacks a premature termination codon and is translated in-frame. The longer, non-spliced (ns) form of the PTC7 RNA encodes a longer protein (Ptc7ns) that contains a single trans-membrane helix located near the N terminus but is otherwise identical to the protein isoform derived from the spliced PTC7 RNA (Ptc7s). The read-through nature of the PTC7 intron is conserved across yeast species, indicating potential functionality for both Ptc7s and Ptc7ns protein isoforms (10.Juneau K. Nislow C. Davis R.W. Alternative splicing of PTC7Saccharomyces cerevisiae determines protein localization.Genetics. 2009; 183: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Ptc7ns has been localized to the nuclear membrane, whereas Ptc7s is located within mitochondria (10.Juneau K. Nislow C. Davis R.W. Alternative splicing of PTC7Saccharomyces cerevisiae determines protein localization.Genetics. 2009; 183: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).

However, mechanisms of regulation of Ptc7 itself and the role of the evolutionarily conserved Ptc7ns isoform remain outstanding questions. CoQ is a redox-active lipid composed of a fully substituted benzoquinone ring and a polyisoprenoid tail and is required for mitochondrial electron transport. The length of the polyisoprenoid group is species-specific; humans produce CoQ10, and S. cerevisiae produce CoQ6, with 10 and 6 isoprene units, respectively. The primary role of CoQ in the inner mitochondrial membrane is to accept the electrons from complex I and complex II and pass those electrons to complex III. Several other metabolic pathways, such as pyrimidine synthesis, sulfide oxidation, and fatty acid β-oxidation, rely on CoQ as an electron carrier (13.Turunen M. Olsson J. Dallner G. Metabolism and function of coenzyme Q.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1660: 171-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). CoQ is present in all intracellular membranes, where it may function as a lipid-soluble antioxidant. Several human syndromes, including encephalomyopathy, ataxia, cerebellar atrophy, myopathy, and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, are linked to primary deficiencies in CoQ biosynthesis (14.Doimo M.

In the former case, Ptc7s is believed to control, at least in part, the phosphorylation state of the Coq7 polypeptide, which modulates its hydroxylase activity. Coq7 catalyzes the hydroxylation of 5-demethoxy-Q6 (DMQ6), the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of CoQ6 in yeast (19.Padilla S. Jonassen T. Jiménez-Hidalgo M.A. Fernández-Ayala D.J.

The conserved SWI/SNF complex utilizes ATP hydrolysis by Snf2, the catalytic subunit, to disrupt specific histone–DNA contacts, resulting in the sliding or eviction of nucleosomes from the locus. As a result, Snf2 activity contributes to transcriptional regulation (21.Whitehouse I. Flaus A. Cairns B.R. White M.F. Workman J.L. Owen-Hughes T.

Mechanism of chromatin remodelling revealed by the Snf2-nucleosome structure.Nature. 2017; 544: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The genome-wide distribution of SWI/SNF is responsive to conditions of stress, and the complex is required for transcription of a number of stress response genes (23.Dutta A. Gogol M. Kim J.H. Smolle M. Venkatesh S. Gilmore J. Florens L. Washburn M.P. Workman J.L.

Composition and function of mutant Swi/Snf complexes.Cell Rep. 2017; 18: 2124-2134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that levels of Snf2 change in response to nutrient conditions. We have also reported that the change in Snf2 leads to changes in levels of RPG transcripts, thereby regulating splicing outcomes (6.Venkataramanan S. Douglass S. Galivanche A.R. Johnson T.L. The chromatin remodeling complex Swi/Snf regulates splicing of meiotic transcripts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; (10.1093/nar/gkx373)Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here, we show that changes in levels of Snf2 modulate the CoQ6 biosynthetic pathway in S. cerevisiae. First, we show that deletion of Snf2 alters the relative levels of Ptc7s and Ptc7ns isoforms in yeast and increases both the rate of synthesis and steady-state levels of CoQ6. This is due to down-regulation of RPG transcripts and an increase in the available pool of spliceosomes. Moreover, we find that the Snf2 protein is down-regulated over time under batch growth conditions and nutrient depletion, and together with a concomitant increase in the splicing of PTC7, this leads to higher CoQ6 levels in preparation for the transition from a fermentative mode of metabolism to a respiratory mode. Furthermore, we show that the two Ptc7 isoforms have opposing effects on the CoQ6 biosynthetic pathway, which may explain contradictory reports in the literature about the effects of Ptc7 on CoQ6 levels (11.Martín-Montalvo A. González-Mariscal I. Pomares-Viciana T. Padilla-López S. Ballesteros M. Vazquez-Fonseca L. Gandolfo P. Brautigan D.L. Navas P. Santos-Ocaña C.

Ptc7p dephosphorylates select mitochondrial proteins to enhance metabolic function.Cell Rep. 2017; 18: 307-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Importantly, although Snf2 is down-regulated in response to nutrient-depleted conditions, it is nonetheless required for growth on nonfermentable carbon sources, suggesting that dynamic control of Snf2 levels is crucial for the transition from fermentation to respiration. Previously published RNA sequencing data for yeast lacking Snf2, the core ATPase component of the SWI/SNF complex (GEO accession number GSE94404), revealed an increase in splicing of a number of introns (6.Venkataramanan S. Douglass S. Galivanche A.R. Johnson T.L. The chromatin remodeling complex Swi/Snf regulates splicing of meiotic transcripts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; (10.1093/nar/gkx373)Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Satisfyingly, the greatest improvement in splicing upon deletion of Snf2 is experienced by RPL22B, via a previously described mechanism consistent with down-regulation of RPG expression (25.Gabunilas J. Chanfreau G. Splicing-mediated autoregulation modulates Rpl22p expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.PLoS Genet. 2016; 12: e1005999Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The next two largest improvements in splicing efficiency are experienced by YBR062C (an ORF of unknown function) and PTC7, a previously described type 2C serine-threonine mitochondrial phosphatase that contains all 11 canonical motifs of the PPM family (type 2C) protein phosphatases, previously reported to play a role in CoQ6 biosynthesis in yeast (11.Martín-Montalvo A. González-Mariscal I. Pomares-Viciana T. Padilla-López S. Ballesteros M. Vazquez-Fonseca L. Gandolfo P. Brautigan D.L. Navas P. Santos-Ocaña C.

Chem. 2013; 288: 28126-28137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). This increase in splicing of PTC7 RNA was verified by RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). In addition, the results from the RNA-seq and RT-PCR were also independently verified by qPCR (data not shown). It has previously been demonstrated that increased splicing of poorly recognized introns can be achieved by decreased expression of competing, highly expressed RPGs (5.Munding E.M. Shiue L. Katzman S. Donohue J.P. Ares Jr., M. Competition between pre-mRNAs for the splicing machinery drives global regulation of splicing.Mol. Cell. 2013; 51: 338-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that deletion of Snf2 causes en masse down-regulation of RPGs and consequent improvement in splicing of a large number of introns (6.Venkataramanan S. Douglass S. Galivanche A.R. Johnson T.L. The chromatin remodeling complex Swi/Snf regulates splicing of meiotic transcripts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; (10.1093/nar/gkx373)Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). RPG down-regulation in the absence of Snf2 was validated by RT-PCR analysis. For example, expression of RPS16A and RPL34B, two intron-containing RPGs, is down-regulated in snf2Δ yeast compared with WT (Fig. 1C). The PTC7 transcript makes two distinct protein isoforms, one from the nonspliced and one from the spliced RNA. The spliced isoform (Ptc7s) localizes to the mitochondria, whereas the nonspliced isoform (Ptc7ns) has been reported to localize to the nuclear envelope (10.Juneau K. Nislow C. Davis R.W. Alternative splicing of PTC7Saccharomyces cerevisiae determines protein localization.Genetics. 2009; 183: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The PTC7 gene was endogenously HA-tagged, and Western blot analysis demonstrated that deletion of Snf2 leads to an increase in the levels of Ptc7s compared with Ptc7ns (Fig. 1D). It is noteworthy that the increase in the ratio of Ptc7s/Ptc7ns polypeptides in the WT and snf2Δ cells appears to be greater than the increased ratio of spliced/unspliced RNA. It has previously been demonstrated that yeast strains lacking Snf2 fail to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources, such as glycerol or acetate (26.Neigeborn L. Carlson M. Genes affecting the regulation of SUC2 gene expression by glucose repression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 1984; 108: 845-858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, snf2Δ mutants frequently incur secondary mutations, and the growth of such strains can resemble WT. Therefore, growth on fermentable and non-fermentable carbon sources was used as a quality control for the assessment of the bona fide phenotype (24.Dutta A. Sardiu M. Gogol M. Gilmore J. Zhang D. Florens L. Abmayr S.M. Washburn M.P. Workman J.L. Composition and function of mutant Swi/Snf complexes.Cell Rep. 2017; 18: 2124-2134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) of snf2Δ prior to each experiment (Fig. 1E). Ptc7s has previously been described as playing a role in regulating CoQ6 synthesis in S. cerevisiae (11.Martín-Montalvo A. González-Mariscal I. Pomares-Viciana T. Padilla-López S. Ballesteros M. Vazquez-Fonseca L. Gandolfo P. Brautigan D.L. Navas P. Santos-Ocaña C. The phosphatase Ptc7 induces coenzyme Q biosynthesis by activating the hydroxylase Coq7 in yeast.J. Biol.

A schematic of the entire CoQ6 biosynthetic pathway with 4-hydroxybenzoic acid as the ring precursor and the role of Ptc7 is detailed in Fig. 2A. Ptc7s is thought to enhance CoQ6 biosynthesis via its activation of Coq7 and subsequent catalysis of the hydroxylation of DMQ6, the penultimate step of CoQ6 biosynthesis (Fig. 2B) (11.Martín-Montalvo A.

J. 2011; 440: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 13C6-Labeled 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (13C6-4HB), a ring precursor for Q biosynthesis, was used to determine the levels of 13C6-CoQ6 biosynthesis in WT versus snf2Δ yeast grown to similar culture densities. The absence of Snf2 causes increased steady-state levels of CoQ6 and increased de novo biogenesis of 13C6-CoQ6 (Fig. 3A). Additionally, there are significant changes in the levels of de novo synthesized DMQ6, as well as 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (HHB), an early CoQ6 biosynthetic intermediate (Fig. 3, B and D). Consistent with the increased synthesis of CoQ6 being a consequence of Ptc7 action, the snf2Δ yeast show significantly lower ratios of 13C6-DMQ6 level to 13C6-CoQ6 content, indicating a significant increase in the efficiency of conversion of DMQ6 to CoQ6, namely the step catalyzed by Coq7, a target of Ptc7s (Fig. 3C) (11.Martín-Montalvo A. González-Mariscal I. Pomares-Viciana T. Padilla-López S. Ballesteros M. Vazquez-Fonseca L. Gandolfo P. Brautigan D.L. Navas P. Santos-Ocaña C.

Chem. 2013; 288: 28126-28137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Strikingly, we also observe that the levels of both steady-state and de novo synthesized HHB are significantly lower in snf2Δ than in the WT yeast (Fig. 3D). This suggests that the deletion of Snf2 not only causes higher CoQ6 production by regulating catalysis from DMQ6 but that it also funnels the early precursors more efficiently than WT, thus allowing a more streamlined conversion of intermediates of the pathway to the overall product of CoQ6. This is reinforced by the observation that snf2Δ yeast show significantly lower ratios of 13C6-HHB to 13C6-CoQ6 content (Fig. 3E). Because snf2Δ yeast have a significantly slower growth rate than WT, we considered the possibility that the increased CoQ6 synthesis was a consequence of the increased time in culture required to achieve equal cell density. To address this, rates of CoQ6 biosynthesis in WT and snf2Δ yeast were determined at timed intervals of culture. First, measurements of steady-state and de novo synthesis rates of CoQ6 between 2 and 12 h of batch growth in YPD revealed that whereas there is indeed an increased rate of synthesis in the snf2Δ yeast strain, the steady-state levels of CoQ6 plateau within 4–6 h of labeling (Fig. 4A). We also observe decreasing levels of Snf2 as the time course progresses and nutrients are depleted (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the role of Snf2 in RPG transcription, RPG levels decrease with time in batch cultures of yeast, in a manner that tracks well with decreasing levels of Snf2 (Fig. 4C). This decrease also coincides with a concomitant increase in the splicing of PTC7 (Fig. 4, D and E). Notably, splicing of the PTC7 transcript in snf2Δ yeast starts off higher than in WT yeast, but as Snf2 is depleted from the WT strain, splicing of the PTC7 transcript approaches the levels of splicing in the snf2Δ strain (Fig. 4F). To better understand the kinetics of CoQ6 synthesis, a shorter time course was performed to capture points preceding the plateau, between 0 and 5 h of labeling. Within 4 h after labeling with 13C-4HB precursor, significant down-regulation in the levels of Snf2 protein is evident (Fig. 5A). The decrease in the level of Snf2 protein is mirrored in the increase in splicing efficiency of PTC7 transcript in the WT strain (Fig. 5, B–E). It is interesting to note that the PTC7 transcript is initially better spliced in the snf2Δ strain than in WT, but as the levels of Snf2 in the WT yeast decrease, splicing improves to a degree comparable with the snf2Δ strain (Fig. 5, D and compare C and F). Additionally, there is a striking increase in the overall CoQ6 product and its de novo biosynthesis in the snf2Δ yeast within 0–5 h of labeling, as compared with CoQ6 levels of the WT during the same time course (Fig. 6, compare A and F). Furthermore, the gradual increase in CoQ6 biosynthesis observed in the WT strain plateaus at 3–4 h after labeling (Fig. 6A), by which point the significant down-regulation in the levels of Snf2 protein is also evident (Fig. 5A). The steady-state and de novo synthesized levels of DMQ6 and HHB were also measured in the 5-h time course of WT and snf2Δ yeast (Fig. 6, B, C, G, and H). Strikingly, the conversion of de novo DMQ6 to CoQ6 increases (as shown by the decreased ratio of 13C6-DMQ6 to 13C6-CoQ6) in a manner concurrent with the decrease in Snf2 levels and increase in PTC7 splicing in WT (compare Fig. 6D with Fig. 5 (A and B)). In fact, as the levels of Snf2 in WT yeast decrease, the conversion efficiency of DMQ6 to CoQ6 approaches the low ratio of DMQ6 to CoQ6 in snf2Δ yeast (Fig. 6, compare D and I). The role of Ptc7s in the increased synthesis of CoQ6 in the absence of Snf2 can be inferred from the observation that whereas the conversion efficiency from DMQ6 to CoQ6 is higher in the absence of Snf2, the level of DMQ6 itself does not change appreciably between WT and snf2Δ yeast over the 5-h time course (Fig. 6, compare B and G). However, the snf2Δ cells also show significantly lower rates of HHB synthesis (Fig. 6, compare C and H), as well as lower ratios of 13C6-HHB to 13C6-CoQ6 content (Fig. 6, compare E and J), consistent with the observatio"
https://openalex.org/W2737220800,"Background People are frequently confronted with untrustworthy claims about the effects of treatments. Uncritical acceptance of these claims can lead to poor, and sometimes dangerous, treatment decisions, and wasted time and money. Resources to help people learn to think critically about treatment claims are scarce, and they are widely scattered. Furthermore, very few learning-resources have been assessed to see if they improve knowledge and behavior. Objectives Our objectives were to develop the Critical thinking and Appraisal Resource Library (CARL). This library was to be in the form of a database containing learning resources for those who are responsible for encouraging critical thinking about treatment claims, and was to be made available online. We wished to include resources for groups we identified as ‘intermediaries’ of knowledge, i.e. teachers of schoolchildren, undergraduates and graduates, for example those teaching evidence-based medicine, or those communicating treatment claims to the public. In selecting resources, we wished to draw particular attention to those resources that had been formally evaluated, for example, by the creators of the resource or independent research groups. Methods CARL was populated with learning-resources identified from a variety of sources—two previously developed but unmaintained inventories; systematic reviews of learning-interventions; online and database searches; and recommendations by members of the project group and its advisors. The learning-resources in CARL were organised by ‘Key Concepts’ needed to judge the trustworthiness of treatment claims, and were made available online by the James Lind Initiative in Testing Treatments interactive (TTi) English (www.testingtreatments.org/category/learning-resources).TTi English also incorporated the database of Key Concepts and the Claim Evaluation Tools developed through the Informed Healthcare Choices (IHC) project (informedhealthchoices.org). Results We have created a database of resources called CARL, which currently contains over 500 open-access learning-resources in a variety of formats: text, audio, video, webpages, cartoons, and lesson materials. These are aimed primarily at ‘Intermediaries’, that is, ‘teachers’, ‘communicators’, ‘advisors’, ‘researchers’, as well as for independent ‘learners’. The resources included in CARL are currently accessible at www.testingtreatments.org/category/learning-resources Conclusions We hope that ready access to CARL will help to promote the critical thinking about treatment claims, needed to help improve healthcare choices."
https://openalex.org/W2736627934,"Patients with a Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) are hemodynamically stable but show an impaired exercise capacity. Aim of this work is to identify and to describe the limiting factors of exercise physiology with a VAD. We searched for data concerning exercise in heart failure condition and after VAD implantation from the literature. Data were analyzed by using a cardiorespiratory simulator that worked as a collector of inputs coming from different papers. As a preliminary step the simulator was used to reproduce the evolution of hemodynamics from rest to peak exercise (ergometer cycling) in heart failure condition. Results evidence an increase of cardiac output of +2.8 l/min and a heart rate increase to 67% of the expected value. Then, we simulated the effect of a continuous-flow VAD at both rest and exercise. Total cardiac output increases of +3.0 l/min (+0.9 l/min due to the VAD and +2.1 l/min to the native ventricle). Since the left ventricle works in a non-linear portion of the diastolic stiffness line, we observed a consistent increase of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (from 14 to 20 mmHg) for a relatively small increase of end-diastolic volume (from 182 to 189 cm3). We finally increased VAD speed during exercise to the maximum possible value and we observed a reduction of wedge pressure (-4.5 mmHg), a slight improvement of cardiac output (8.0 l/min) and a complete unloading of the native ventricle. The VAD can assure a proper hemodynamics at rest, but provides an insufficient unloading of the left ventricle and does not prevent wedge pressure from rising during exercise. Neither the VAD provides major benefits during exercise in terms of total cardiac output, which increases to a similar extend to an unassisted heart failure condition. VAD speed modulation can contribute to better unload the ventricle but the maximal flow reachable with the current devices is below the cardiac output observed in a healthy heart."
https://openalex.org/W2739405852,"The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway that plays important roles in stem cell biology, tissue homeostasis, and cancer development. Vestigial-like 4 (Vgll4) functions as a transcriptional co-repressor in the Hippo-Yes-associated protein (YAP) pathway. Vgll4 inhibits cell proliferation and tumor growth by competing with YAP for binding to TEA-domain proteins (TEADs). However, the mechanisms by which Vgll4 itself is regulated are unclear. Here we identified a mechanism that regulates Vgll4's tumor-suppressing function. We found that Vgll4 is phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) during antimitotic drug-induced mitotic arrest and also in normal mitosis. We further identified Ser-58, Ser-155, Thr-159, and Ser-280 as the main mitotic phosphorylation sites in Vgll4. We also noted that the nonphosphorylatable mutant Vgll4-4A (S58A/S155A/T159A/S280A) suppressed tumorigenesis in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo to a greater extent than did wild-type Vgll4, suggesting that mitotic phosphorylation inhibits Vgll4's tumor-suppressive activity. Consistent with these observations, the Vgll4-4A mutant possessed higher-binding affinity to TEAD1 than wild-type Vgll4. Interestingly, Vgll4 and Vgll4-4A markedly suppressed YAP and β-catenin signaling activity. Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism for Vgll4 regulation in mitosis and its role in tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2739421687,"Serum amyloid A (SAA) is the major acute-phase protein and a precursor of amyloid A (AA) in AA amyloidosis in humans and animals. SAA isoforms have been identified in a wide variety of animals, such as SAA1, SAA2, SAA3, and SAA4 in mouse. Although the biological functions of SAA isoforms are not completely understood, recent studies have suggested that SAA3 plays a role in host defense. Expression of SAA3 is increased on the mouse colon surface in the presence of microbiota in vivo, and it increases mRNA expression of mucin 2 (MUC2) in murine colonic epithelial cells in vitro, which constitutes a protective mucus barrier in the intestinal tract. In this study, to identify responsible regions in SAA3 for MUC2 expression, recombinant murine SAA1 (rSAA1), rSAA3, and rSAA1/3, a chimera protein constructed with mature SAA1 (amino acids 1–36) and SAA3 (amino acids 37–103), and vice versa for rSAA3/1, were added to murine colonic epithelial CMT-93 cells, and the mRNA expressions of MUC2 and cytokines were measured. Inhibition assays with NF-κB inhibitor or TLR4/MD2 inhibitor were also performed. Up-regulation of MUC2 mRNA expression was strongly stimulated by rSAA3 and rSAA3/1, but not by rSAA1 or rSAA1/3. Moreover, NF-κB and TLR4/MD2 inhibitors suppressed the increase of MUC2 mRNA expression. These results suggest that the major responsible region for MUC2 expression exists in amino acids 1–36 of SAA3, and that up-regulations of MUC2 expression by SAA3 and SAA3/1 are involved with activation of NF-κB via the TLR4/MD2 complex."

The molecular events mediating the DKK3-dependent arrest of ß-catenin-driven cell proliferation in cancer cells are unknown. Here we report the identification of a new intracellular gene product originating from the Dkk3 locus.

It is essential for early mouse development and is a newly recognized regulator of ß-catenin signaling and cell proliferation. Dkk3b interrupts nuclear translocation ß-catenin by capturing cytoplasmic, unphosphorylated ß-catenin in an extra-nuclear complex with ß-TrCP.

CT inhibits bone resorption and maintains bone mass through G protein-coupled receptor-mediated interactions with osteoclasts, and it has therefore been used as a therapeutic for the bone diseases osteoporosis and Paget's disease (1.Zaidi M.

However, CT-based therapies have been limited by the intrinsic tendency of CT to aggregate in solution as both the structural reformatting and sequestration of CT during its aggregation decrease bioavailability and efficacy (5.Cudd A.

Structural biology of calcitonin: from aqueous therapeutic properties to amyloid aggregation.Isr. J. Chem. 2016; (10.1002/ijch.201600096)Google Scholar). The characteristics of CT's aggregation mark it as a member of the amyloid family. These peptides and proteins are characterized by their propensity to form amyloid fibrils, in which monomeric subunits adopt β-strand structures and stack along the fibril axis through intermolecular hydrogen-bonding and electrostatic interactions (7.Harrison R.S. Sharpe P.C. Singh Y. Fairlie D.P. Amyloid peptides and proteins in review.Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 159: 1-77PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of these fibrils and the general process by which they form from their respective monomeric subunits is thought to be relatively conserved across different primary sequences (7.Harrison R.S. Sharpe P.C. Singh Y. Fairlie D.P. Amyloid peptides and proteins in review.Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 159: 1-77PubMed Google Scholar, 8.DeToma A.S. Salamekh S. Ramamoorthy A. Lim M.H. Misfolded proteins in Alzheimer's disease and type II diabetes.Chem. Soc. Rev. 2012; 41: 608-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Briefly, during the initial phase of aggregation known as the lag phase, peptide monomers self-associate to form small, soluble aggregates (oligomers), with continued aggregation leading to the production of protofibrils. Such protofibrils then seed rapid elongation through monomer addition, leading to the formation of mature amyloid fibrils. Crucially, the fibrillation of amyloidogenic peptides has been shown to play a role in a number of disease pathologies. At least 60 such peptides have been identified in humans, with more than half having been implicated in diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (9.Spillantini M.G.

Despite extensive investigations, significant confusion remains as to the details of aggregation and the specific roles that such peptide aggregates play in disease pathology. The heterogeneous and metastable nature of the prefibrillar aggregates as well as the large effects that subtle shifts in environmental factors have on aggregation have combined to obfuscate the identification of critical aggregation intermediates or specific toxic species. A detailed elucidation of amyloid aggregation would both aid in disease understanding and provide guidance in efforts to inhibit aggregation and toxicity. For CT in particular there is a need to slow aggregation to improve therapeutic efficacy. To this end the rapidly aggregating human calcitonin (hCT) has been replaced by the slower aggregating salmon calcitonin (sCT) as the current standard in calcitonin-based osteoporosis therapy (14.Fowler S.B. Poon S. Muff R. Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Zurdo J. Rational design of aggregation-resistant bioactive peptides: reengineering human calcitonin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Salmon calcitonin: a review of current and future therapeutic indications.Osteoporos. Int. 2008; 19: 479-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Despite improvements over hCT, sCT-based therapies are associated with side effects and immune responses that interfere with therapeutic efficacy (4.Singer F.R. Fredericks R.S. Minkin C.

Additionally, hCT maintains improved therapeutic efficacy compared with sCT when aggregation is controlled and is free of the side effects and immune responses associated with sCT (5.Cudd A.

Res. 1993; 25: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Significant interest therefore exists in slowing the aggregation of hCT to improve its utility as a therapeutic agent. Here we show for the first time a direct relationship between peptide concentration and lag time in the aggregation of hCT. Such a trend goes against the conventional wisdom of the amyloid field, where increasing concentrations lead to faster aggregation (18.Avidan-Shpalter C. Gazit E.

In several other amyloids, including the closely related human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), “micelle-like” oligomers formed above a critical micelle concentration (CMC) have emerged as potential key kinetic-modulating intermediates; however, such intermediates in hCT were found to be kinetically inactive (19.Sabaté R.

Instead, our results point to the need for monomer structural conversion as responsible for the trend. We investigated the concentration-dependent and structural differences in these species and propose a novel kinetic model for amyloid formation by hCT. Further elucidation of this aggregation pathway could identify key intermediates and inform future efforts in kinetics modification in the therapeutic applications of CT. Thioflavin-T (ThT) assays have become the standard for kinetic monitoring of amyloid fibril growth due to the quantum yield increase in ThT upon binding to β-sheet rich structures (24.Batzli K.M.

We used ThT assays to probe the concentration dependence of hCT aggregation rates. ThT kinetic curves were measured for a range of initial monomer concentrations (Fig. 1A). The ThT traces of hCT show the typical sigmoidal fibril growth pattern characteristic of amyloids; however, the direct relationship between peptide concentration and lag time (time duration of the lag phase) is contrary to the expected behavior (Fig. 1B). Amyloids typically present an inverse relationship between initial monomer concentration and lag time as reported in the literature (18.Avidan-Shpalter C. Gazit E.

Chem. B. 2012; 116: 6611-6617Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is well-established that the aggregation characteristics of amyloids depend heavily on their aggregation environment, yet the atypical trend observed for hCT is found to persist through changes of buffer (concentration and type), salt concentration, pH, agitation, and temperature (supplemental Fig. S1) (29.Milton N.G.

This consistency indicates the behavior to be characteristic of hCT rather than a consequence of a specific set of environmental conditions. To ensure that the ThT data were reflective of the macroscopic peptide behavior rather than a report on a limited sub-population, population-wide secondary structure was determined via CD spectroscopy. The time evolution of secondary structure was measured for 30 μm and 120 μm initial monomer concentrations (Fig. 1, C–D). At both concentrations, hCT initially displayed a primarily random coil secondary structure, typical for monomers of CT (31.Huang R. Vivekanandan S. Brender J.R. Abe Y. Naito A. Ramamoorthy A.

Acta. 2014; 1842: 1622-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Aggregation was accompanied by a depletion in the random coil peak and a subsequent increase in β-sheet signal for both peptide concentrations, confirming the ThT-detected increase in β-sheet to be representative of the overall peptide population. The β-sheet signal was stable for at least 24 h, indicating the hCT to have reached its mature fibrillar state. Consistent with the trend found from ThT fluorescence data, the 120 μm hCT took approximately 4 times longer to undergo the transition to a β-sheet conformation than the 30 μm hCT. For both conditions, significant signal loss occurred due to the aggregation and gelation of the peptide, a phenomenon previously described for CT (34.Gaudiano M.C. Colone M. Bombelli C. Chistolini P. Valvo L. Diociaiuti M. Early stages of salmon calcitonin aggregation: effect induced by ageing and oxidation processes in water and in the presence of model membranes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1750: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To ensure signal loss did not introduce artifacts into secondary structure determinations, end stage β-sheet morphology was verified by single-point ThT fluorescence (data not shown). TEM images were also taken to further confirm the validity of our ThT and CD results. Aggregation of 30 μm and 120 μm hCT was tracked by ThT fluorescence, and samples were removed for imaging at equivalent stages of aggregation for both concentrations (supplemental Fig. S2). Early and late lag phase images show short, ThT-negative, protofibrillar aggregates of a few hundred nanometers in length (Fig. 1, E–H). The protofibrils are morphologically indistinguishable between early and late lag phase for both concentrations, with the exception of concentration-dependent density differences. Final stage aggregates show long, thin amyloid aggregates forming fibrils (Fig. 1, I–J). Again, the aggregate morphology remains the same in both samples. Both concentrations exhibited the canonical progression of fibril formation via nucleating protofibrils and elongation, with no discernable concentration-dependent differences in morphology at any stage. Combined with the ThT assays, our CD and TEM results confirm the direct relationship between peptide concentration and lag time to be a genuine behavior. The observed hCT concentration-dependent differences in lag time combined with the conserved elongation rates are consistent with theoretical predictions of differences in primary nucleation rate (35.Arosio P. Knowles T.P. Linse S. On the lag phase in amyloid fibril formation.Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2015; 17: 7606-7618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of concentration-dependent morphological differences in protofibrillar or fibrillar aggregates by TEM or CD supports the idea that concentration-dependent changes in lag time involve the rate of nucleus formation rather than the characteristics of the nucleus itself (36.Dean D.N. Das P.K. Rana P. Burg F. Levites Y. Morgan S.E. Ghosh P. Rangachari V. Strain-specific fibril propagation by an Aβ dodecamer.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 40787Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To probe this hypothesis, seeded ThT kinetics assays were performed (37.Ban T. Hoshino M. Takahashi S. Hamada D. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Direct observation of Aβ amyloid fibril growth and inhibition.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 38.Ogi H. Fukukshima M. Hamada H. Noi K. Hirao M. Yagi H.

Seed-dependent accelerated fibrillation of α-synuclein induced by periodic ultrasonication treatment.J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2007; 17: 2027-2032PubMed Google Scholar). Although the addition of seeds accelerated fibril formation, an extended lag phase remained even in the presence of high seed concentrations (supplemental Fig. S3A). Additionally, in the presence of seed the monomer concentration dependence of the lag phase was abolished (supplemental Fig. S3B). A lag time independent of free monomer concentration is expected for seeded ThT assays and is consistent with differences in primary nucleation rate contributing to the direct relationship between lag time and peptide concentration. However, the persistence of an extended lag time even with 15% seeding by volume implies that the existence of primary nuclei is not sufficient for fibril formation and elongation, with such a phenomenon having been previously shown in other systems (40.Shoffner S.K. Schnell S. Estimation of the lag time in a subsequent monomer addition model for fibril elongation.Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2016; 18: 21259-21268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results of our seeded ThT kinetics assays focused further analysis on the presence and interconversion of oligomeric intermediates that dominate the lag phase. To probe the kinetics of oligomerization rather than fibril formation, the time evolution of hCT aggregate size was monitored using Dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments. Despite peptide preparations minimizing the number of non-monomeric species initially present, peaks representing small oligomeric species and larger aggregates appear rapidly after sample preparation at both high (120 μm) and low (30 μm) hCT concentrations (Fig. 2A). To confirm the detected species as hCT aggregates rather than artifacts, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a natural product known to interact with and break apart amyloid aggregates including oligomers of hCT, was added (31.Huang R. Vivekanandan S. Brender J.R. Abe Y. Naito A. Ramamoorthy A. NMR characterization of monomeric and oligomeric conformations of human calcitonin and its interaction with EGCG.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 416: 108-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 41.Palhano F.L. Lee J. Grimster N.P. Kelly J.W.

Liu H. Yao X. Exploring the influence of EGCG on the β-sheet-rich oligomers of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP1–37) and identifying its possible binding sites from molecular dynamics simulation.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e94796Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The addition of EGCG shifted the small oligomeric peak from 2 to 5 nm to <1 nm in radius, confirming the source of the peak to be small soluble aggregates (Fig. 2A). The peak associated with larger, potentially protofibrillar aggregates was unaffected by EGCG. Previous studies have revealed the effect of EGCG on hCT aggregates to be mediated primarily by interactions between the aromatic rings of EGCG with those of Tyr-12 and Phe-16 (31.Huang R. Vivekanandan S. Brender J.R. Abe Y. Naito A. Ramamoorthy A. NMR characterization of monomeric and oligomeric conformations of human calcitonin and its interaction with EGCG.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 416: 108-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The ability of EGCG to remodel only low molecular weight aggregates by DLS would suggest the larger aggregates to be significantly more stable, potentially due to the sequestration and subsequent solvent inaccessibility of the aromatic residues. In EGCG-free preparations, two clear differences in aggregate size appear. First, the smaller peak representing low molecular weight oligomer species shows consistently larger aggregates for 120 μm hCT (4–5-nm radius) as opposed to 30 μm (1–2 nm radius) (Fig. 2B). Such a finding suggests that the oligomeric population is concentration-dependent, favoring larger oligomers at higher concentrations. Second, the observed changes in the larger peak initially appearing at ∼100 nm for both conditions indicate a significantly faster growth for samples containing 120 μm hCT compared with those containing 30 μm, which suggests a more rapid reorganization of aggregates to larger species at higher concentrations (Fig. 2C). DLS results do not exhibit any statistically significant concentration- or time-dependent differences in mass distribution between peaks. The majority of peptide mass (∼80%) is contained in peak I as expected for early aggregation stages (supplemental Fig. S4), indicating that the relative percentage of peptide in each peak remains fixed over the time-course measured in the experiment. To further probe the concentration-dependent time evolution of hCT oligomers, a time-course 1D 1H NMR experiment was used to track the progression of oligomerization by monitoring the peak at −0.1 ppm. This peak appears in the NMR spectra of amyloidogenic peptides when aliphatic protons are shielded from solvent, as occurs when they are sequestered in oligomeric aggregates (31.Huang R. Vivekanandan S. Brender J.R. Abe Y. Naito A. Ramamoorthy A. NMR characterization of monomeric and oligomeric conformations of human calcitonin and its interaction with EGCG.J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2736754746,"In nanoflow liquid chromatography-matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight (nanoLC-MALDI-TOF/TOF) approaches, it is critical to directly apply small amounts of the sample elutes on the sample target using a nanoLC system due to its low flow rate of 200 ~ 300 nl/min. It is recommended to apply a sheath liquid containing a matrix with a several μL/min flow rate at the end of the nanoLC column to ensure a larger co-eluted droplet for more reproducible sample spotting and avoid the laborious task of post-manual matrix spotting. In this study, to achieve a better nanoLC-MALDI performance on sample spotting, we first compared α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) solvent composition for efficiently concentrating nanoLC elutes on an anchor chip. The solvent composition of isopropanol (IPA): acetonitrile (ACN):acetone:0.1% Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (2:7:7:2) provided strong and homogeneous signals with higher peptide ion yields than the other solvent compositions. Then, nanoLC-MALDI-TOF/TOF was applied to study the impact of aflatoxin B1 on the liver proteome from diabetes mellitus type 1 mice. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), produced by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus is a carcinogen and a known causative agent of liver cancer. To evaluate the effects of long-term exposure to AFB1 on type 1 diabetes mellitus (TIDM), the livers of T1DM control mice and mice treated with AFB1 were analyzed using isotope-coded protein labeling (ICPL)-based quantitative proteomics. Our results showed that gluconeogenesis, lipid, and oxidative phosphorylation mechanisms, normally elevated in T1DM, were disordered following AFB1 treatment. In addition, major urinary protein 1 (MUP1), an indicator of increased insulin sensitivity, was significantly decreased in the T1DM/AFB1 group and may have resulted in higher blood glucose levels compared to the T1DM group. These results indicate that T1DM patients should avoid the AFB1 intake, as they could lead to increased blood glucose levels and disorders of energy-producing mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2737304330,"Previous event-related potential (ERP) research utilizing oddball stimulus paradigms suggests diminished processing of speech versus non-speech sounds in children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, brain mechanisms underlying these speech processing abnormalities, and to what extent they are related to poor language abilities in this population remain unknown. In the current study, we utilized a novel paired repetition paradigm in order to investigate ERP responses associated with the detection and discrimination of speech and non-speech sounds in 4- to 6—year old children with ASD, compared with gender and verbal age matched controls. ERPs were recorded while children passively listened to pairs of stimuli that were either both speech sounds, both non-speech sounds, speech followed by non-speech, or non-speech followed by speech. Control participants exhibited N330 match/mismatch responses measured from temporal electrodes, reflecting speech versus non-speech detection, bilaterally, whereas children with ASD exhibited this effect only over temporal electrodes in the left hemisphere. Furthermore, while the control groups exhibited match/mismatch effects at approximately 600 ms (central N600, temporal P600) when a non-speech sound was followed by a speech sound, these effects were absent in the ASD group. These findings suggest that children with ASD fail to activate right hemisphere mechanisms, likely associated with social or emotional aspects of speech detection, when distinguishing non-speech from speech stimuli. Together, these results demonstrate the presence of atypical speech versus non-speech processing in children with ASD when compared with typically developing children matched on verbal age."
https://openalex.org/W2737876545,"This study investigates whether listeners’ experience with a second language learned later in life affects their use of fundamental frequency (F0) as a cue to word boundaries in the segmentation of an artificial language (AL), particularly when the cues to word boundaries conflict between the first language (L1) and second language (L2). F0 signals phrase-final (and thus word-final) boundaries in French but word-initial boundaries in English. Participants were functionally monolingual French listeners, functionally monolingual English listeners, bilingual L1-English L2-French listeners, and bilingual L1-French L2-English listeners. They completed the AL-segmentation task with F0 signaling word-final boundaries or without prosodic cues to word boundaries (monolingual groups only). After listening to the AL, participants completed a forced-choice word-identification task in which the foils were either non-words or part-words. The results show that the monolingual French listeners, but not the monolingual English listeners, performed better in the presence of F0 cues than in the absence of such cues. Moreover, bilingual status modulated listeners’ use of F0 cues to word-final boundaries, with bilingual French listeners performing less accurately than monolingual French listeners on both word types but with bilingual English listeners performing more accurately than monolingual English listeners on non-words. These findings not only confirm that speech segmentation is modulated by the L1, but also newly demonstrate that listeners’ experience with the L2 (French or English) affects their use of F0 cues in speech segmentation. This suggests that listeners’ use of prosodic cues to word boundaries is adaptive and non-selective, and can change as a function of language experience."
https://openalex.org/W2737585136,"Histone modifications are associated with transcriptional regulation by diverse transcription factors. Genome-wide correlation studies have revealed that histone activation marks and repression marks are associated with activated and repressed gene expression, respectively. Among the histone activation marks is histone H3 K79 methylation, which is carried out by only a single methyltransferase, disruptor of telomeric silencing-1-like (DOT1L). We have been studying thyroid hormone (T3)-dependent amphibian metamorphosis in two highly related species, the pseudo-tetraploid Xenopus laevis and diploid Xenopus tropicalis, as a model for postembryonic development, a period around birth in mammals that is difficult to study. We previously showed that H3K79 methylation levels are induced at T3 target genes during natural and T3-induced metamorphosis and that Dot1L is itself a T3 target gene. These suggest that T3 induces Dot1L expression, and Dot1L in turn functions as a T3 receptor (TR) coactivator to promote vertebrate development. We show here that in cotransfection studies or in the reconstituted frog oocyte in vivo transcription system, overexpression of Dot1L enhances gene activation by TR in the presence of T3. Furthermore, making use of the ability to carry out transgenesis in X. laevis and gene knockdown in X. tropicalis, we demonstrate that endogenous Dot1L is critical for T3-induced activation of endogenous TR target genes while transgenic Dot1L enhances endogenous TR function in premetamorphic tadpoles in the presence of T3. Our studies thus for the first time provide complementary gain- and loss-of functional evidence in vivo for a cofactor, Dot1L, in gene activation by TR during vertebrate development.-Wen, L., Fu, L., Shi, Y.-B. Histone methyltransferase Dot1L is a coactivator for thyroid hormone receptor during Xenopus development."
https://openalex.org/W2737618331,"Objective To determine the effects of exogenous glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), with or without massive distal bowel resection, on adaptation of jejunal mucosa, enteric neurons, gut hormones and tissue reserves in rats. Background GLP-2 is a gut hormone known to be trophic for small bowel mucosa, and to mimic intestinal adaptation in short bowel syndrome (SBS). However, the effects of exogenous GLP-2 and SBS on enteric neurons are unclear. Methods Sprague Dawley rats were randomized to four treatments: Transected Bowel (TB) (n = 8), TB + GLP-2 (2.5 nmol/kg/h, n = 8), SBS (n = 5), or SBS + GLP-2 (2.5 nmol/kg/h, n = 9). SBS groups underwent a 60% jejunoileal resection with cecectomy and jejunocolic anastomosis. All rats were maintained on parenteral nutrition for 7 d. Parameters measured included gut morphometry, qPCR for hexose transporter (SGLT-1, GLUT-2, GLUT-5) and GLP-2 receptor mRNA, whole mount immunohistochemistry for neurons (HuC/D, VIP, nNOS), plasma glucose, gut hormones, and body composition. Results Resection increased the proportion of nNOS immunopositive myenteric neurons, intestinal muscularis propria thickness and crypt cell proliferation, which were not recapitulated by GLP-2 therapy. Exogenous GLP-2 increased jejunal mucosal surface area without affecting enteric VIP or nNOS neuronal immunopositivity, attenuated resection-induced reductions in jejunal hexose transporter abundance (SGLT-1, GLUT-2), increased plasma amylin and decreased peptide YY concentrations. Exogenous GLP-2 attenuated resection-induced increases in blood glucose and body fat loss. Conclusions Exogenous GLP-2 stimulates jejunal adaptation independent of enteric neuronal VIP or nNOS changes, and has divergent effects on plasma amylin and peptide YY concentrations. The novel ability of exogenous GLP-2 to modulate resection-induced changes in peripheral glucose and lipid reserves may be important in understanding the whole-body response following intestinal resection, and is worthy of further study."
https://openalex.org/W2736426346,"This paper forecasts the 2016 canine Anaplasma spp. seroprevalence in the United States from eight climate, geographic and societal factors. The forecast’s construction and an assessment of its performance are described. The forecast is based on a spatial-temporal conditional autoregressive model fitted to over 11 million Anaplasma spp. seroprevalence test results for dogs conducted in the 48 contiguous United States during 2011–2015. The forecast uses county-level data on eight predictive factors, including annual temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, county elevation, forestation coverage, surface water coverage, population density and median household income. Non-static factors are extrapolated into the forthcoming year with various statistical methods. The fitted model and factor extrapolations are used to estimate next year’s regional prevalence. The correlation between the observed and model-estimated county-by-county Anaplasma spp. seroprevalence for the five-year period 2011–2015 is 0.902, demonstrating reasonable model accuracy. The weighted correlation (accounting for different sample sizes) between 2015 observed and forecasted county-by-county Anaplasma spp. seroprevalence is 0.987, exhibiting that the proposed approach can be used to accurately forecast Anaplasma spp. seroprevalence. The forecast presented herein can a priori alert veterinarians to areas expected to see Anaplasma spp. seroprevalence beyond the accepted endemic range. The proposed methods may prove useful for forecasting other diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2738177279,"Monitoring protected areas (PAs) is essential for systematic evaluation of their effectiveness in terms of habitat protection, preservation and representativeness. This study illustrates how the use of species distribution models that combine remote sensing data and information about biodiversity surrogates can contribute to develop a systematic protocol for monitoring PAs. In particular, we assessed the effectiveness of the Natura 2000 (N2000) network, for conserving and preserving the representativeness of seven raptor species in a highly-dynamic landscape in northwest Spain between 2001 and 2014. We also evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the N2000 network by using the total area under protection as a proxy for conservation costs. Overall, the N2000 network was found to poorly represent the habitats of the raptor species. Despite the low representativeness, this network showed a high degree of effectiveness due to increased overall habitat availability for generalist and forest specialist species between 2001 and 2014. Nevertheless, additional protected areas should be established in the near future to increase their representativeness, and thus ensure the protection of open-habitat specialist species and their priority habitats. In addition, proactive conservation measures in natural and semi-natural ecosystems (in particular, montane heathlands) will be essential for long-term protection of Montagu’s harrier (species listed in the Annex I of the Bird Directive), and thus complying with the current European Environmental Legislation. This study sheds light on how the development and application of new protected area indices based on the combined use of freely-available satellite data and species distribution models may contribute substantially to the cost-efficiency of the PA monitoring systems, and to the ‘Fitness Check’ process of EU Nature Directives."
https://openalex.org/W2738263720,"Tetracycline repressors (TetRs) modulate multidrug efflux pathways in several pathogenic bacteria. In Streptomyces, they additionally regulate secondary metabolic pathways like antibiotic production. For instance, in the antibiotic producer Streptomyces fradiae, a layered network of TetRs regulates the levels of the commercially important antibiotic tylosin, with TylP occupying the top of this cascading network. TetRs exist in two functional states, the DNA-bound and the ligand-bound form, which are allosterically regulated. Here, to develop deeper insights into the factors that govern allostery, the crystal structure of TylP was solved to a resolution of 2.3 Å. The structure revealed that TylP possesses several unique features; notably, it harbors a unique C-terminal helix-loop extension that spans the entire length of the structure. This anchor connects the DNA-binding domain (DBD) with the ligand-binding domain (LBD) via a mix of positively charged and hydrogen-bonding interactions. Supporting EMSA studies with a series of ΔC truncated versions show that a systematic deletion of this region results in complete loss of DNA binding. The structure additionally revealed that TylP is markedly different in the orientation of its DBD and LBD architecture and the dimeric geometry from its hypothesized Streptomyces homologue CprB, which is a γ-butyrolactone regulator. Rather, TylP is closer in structural design to macrolide-binding TetRs found in pathogens.

https://openalex.org/W2737049966,"Background Deprivation usually encompasses material, social, and health components. It has been shown to be associated with greater risks of developing chronic health conditions and of worse outcome in multimorbidity. The DipCare questionnaire, an instrument developed and validated in Switzerland for use in primary care, identifies patients subject to potentially higher levels of deprivation. Objectives To identifying determinants of the material, social, and health profiles associated with deprivation in a sample of multimorbid, primary care patients, and thus set priorities in screening for deprivation in this population. Design Secondary analysis from a nationwide cross-sectional study in Switzerland. Participants A random sample of 886 adult patients suffering from at least three chronic health conditions. Main measures The outcomes of interest were the patients’ levels of deprivation as measured using the DipCare questionnaire. Classification And Regression Tree analysis identified the independent variables that separated the examined population into groups with increasing deprivation scores. Finally, a sensitivity analysis (multivariate regression) confirmed the robustness of our results. Key results Being aged under 64 years old was associated with higher overall, material, and health deprivation; being aged over 77 years old was associated with higher social deprivation. Other variables associated with deprivation were the level of education, marital status, and the presence of depression or chronic pain. Conclusion Specific profiles, such as being younger, were associated with higher levels of overall, material, and health deprivation in multimorbid patients. In contrast, patients over 77 years old reported higher levels of social deprivation. Furthermore, chronic pain and depression added to the score for health deprivation. It is important that GPs consider the possibility of deprivation in these multimorbid patients and are able to identify it, both in order to encourage treatment adherence and limit any forgoing of care for financial reasons."

In response to the ligand EGF, the receptor dimerizes, leading to autophosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues on its intracellular domain (1.Avraham R. Yarden Y. Feedback regulation of EGFR signaling: decision making by early and delayed loops.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 104-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). This in turn activates downstream proliferative pathways, such as Ras/MAPKs and PI3K/AKT (1.Avraham R. Yarden Y. Feedback regulation of EGFR signaling: decision making by early and delayed loops.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 104-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). EGFR is activated via overexpression and amplification in colon, pancreas, lung, and breast cancers and via mutations in lung and brain tumors. Inhibiting EGFR is therefore considered to be an important anti-cancer strategy (1.Avraham R. Yarden Y. Feedback regulation of EGFR signaling: decision making by early and delayed loops.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 104-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). EGFR can be inhibited by small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that compete for the ATP-binding site of the catalytic domain (2.Arora A. Scholar E.M. Role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in cancer therapy.J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Understanding resistance to EGFR inhibitors: impact on future treatment strategies.Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2010; 7: 493-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Although anti-EGFR therapy has great potential, resistance remains a major obstacle for its successful clinical application (4.Shaib W. Mahajan R. El-Rayes B. Markers of resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in colorectal cancer.J. Gastrointest. Oncol. 2013; 4: 308-318PubMed Google Scholar). K-Ras mutations occur in up to 50% of colon cancers, 95% of pancreatic cancers, and 25% of lung cancers (5.Prior I.A. Lewis P.D. Mattos C. A comprehensive survey of ras mutations in cancer.Cancer Res. 2012; 72: 2457-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). Such mutations are invariably associated with the intrinsic resistance to anti-EGFR therapy (4.Shaib W. Mahajan R. El-Rayes B. Markers of resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in colorectal cancer.J.

However, the mechanisms by which K-Ras mutation confers the resistance are largely unknown (1.Avraham R. Yarden Y.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that activated p38γ mediates K-Ras signaling to confer the intrinsic resistance to TKIs through its interaction and activation of c-Jun and PTPH1. Our results show that upon K-Ras mutation, activated p38γ stimulates EGFR gene transcription and protein tyrosine dephosphorylation through increased complex formation with c-Jun and PTPH1. Together, these lead to elevated levels of non-phosphorylated EGFR, which is unresponsive to TKIs but is still proliferative. Further analyses demonstrate that disruption of the p38γ/c-Jun/PTPH1 signaling network can restore the sensitivity to EGFR TKIs. To determine whether K-Ras mutation causes the unresponsiveness to TKIs as observed clinically (7.Misale S. Di Nicolantonio F. Sartore-Bianchi A. Siena S. Bardelli A.

As shown in Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1A, TKIs have no substantial effects on colony formation of HCT116 human colon cancer cells with mutant K-Ras, but they significantly suppress the growth in HCT116 sublines HKe3 and HK2-8, in which the mutant K-Ras allele was selectively disrupted by homologous recombination (23.Shirasawa S.

We next investigated whether the hyperexpression of p38γ/c-Jun in K-Ras mutant cells can impact EGFR expression and phosphorylation. The results (Fig. 1, C and D) show increased p38γ, c-Jun, and EGFR protein levels but decreased EGFR phosphorylation in a panel of K-Ras mutant (MT) cells as compared with those with WT K-Ras. Because TKIs prevent EGFR phosphorylation, subsequently blocking activation of downstream proliferative pathways (29.Schlessinger J.

Cancer Res. 2015; 5: 2531-2561PubMed Google Scholar), the unresponsiveness of K-Ras mutant cells to TKIs may be caused by decreased p-EGFR. To directly test this possibility, a non-phosphorable mutant EGFR (Y1173F) (31.Hsu J.M. Chen C.T. Chou C.K. Kuo H.P. Li L.Y. Lin C.Y. Lee H.J. Wang Y.N. Liu M. Liao H.W. Shi B. Lai C.C. Bedford M.T.

Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) was expressed by retroviral infection, and resultant cells were analyzed for growth inhibition by TKIs. Consistent with the decreased p-EGFR and the TKI insensitivity in K-Ras mutant cells, ectopically expressed EGFR/Y1173F leads to TKI resistance in K-Ras wild-type cells without affecting the K-Ras mutant line (Fig. 1E and supplemental Fig. S1C). These results indicate that a non-phosphorylated EGFR is sufficient to confer TKI resistance downstream of mutant K-Ras and that one mechanism for the K-Ras mutation–associated resistance may occur through increased EGFR dephosphorylation. Results (Fig. 1, C and D) also show increased EGFR protein expression in K-Ras mutant cells. Whereas EGFR is frequently overexpressed in human cancers, the responsible mechanisms are largely unknown (1.Avraham R. Yarden Y.

The results (Fig. 2, A–C) show that p38γ overexpression in normal rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) (12.Tang J. Qi X. Mercola D. Han J. Chen G.

Chem. 2005; 280: 23910-23917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) stimulates c-Jun and EGFR mRNA and protein expression, whereas p38γ depletion from K-Ras mutant colon cancer HCT116 and SW480 cells has an opposite effect. A forced c-Jun expression in HCT116 cells increases the growth and elevates EGFR protein levels without impacting p38γ expression (Fig. 2D), indicating its oncogenic activity downstream of p38γ and upstream of EGFR. Consistent with this notion, c-Jun depletion in K-Ras mutant cells reduces colony formation and decreases EGFR protein expression without affecting p38γ levels (supplemental Fig. S2, A–C). Of great interest, EGFR knockdown in these cells still inhibits growth without affecting p38γ and c-Jun protein levels (supplemental Fig. S2, A–C). These results indicate that intrinsic EGFR in K-Ras mutant cells is still capable of driving the malignant growth despite the resistance of these cells to TKIs, as observed in patients with K-Ras mutant cancer (1.Avraham R. Yarden Y. Feedback regulation of EGFR signaling: decision making by early and delayed loops.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 104-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Together with the ability of p38γ to promote K-Ras oncogenic activity (12.Tang J. Qi X. Mercola D. Han J. Chen G. Essential role of p38γ in K-Ras transformation independent of phosphorylation.J.

Previous studies showed that p38γ is both cytoplasmic and nuclear, whereas its phosphorylated form is predominantly localized in the nucleus (33.Qi X. Tang J. Loesch M. Pohl N. Alkan S.

Chem. 2012; 287: 27895-27905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we examined whether K-Ras mutation triggers p38γ nuclear translocation, thus increasing its interaction with c-Jun. Cell fractionation analyses show that there is increased p38γ nuclear accumulation in K-Ras mutant cells relative to their K-Ras wild-type counterparts (Fig. 3A). These increases in p38γ also correlate with elevated c-Jun in the nucleus, as revealed by cell fractionation and co-localization analyses (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S3A). These results indicate that p38γ and c-Jun may collaborate to promote K-Ras oncogenesis through their enhanced nuclear activities. We next used ChIP assays (14.Loesch M. Zhi H.Y. Hou S.W. Qi X.M. Li R.S. Basir Z. Iftner T. Cuenda A. Chen G. p38γ MAPK cooperates with c-Jun in trans-activating matrix metalloproteinase 9.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 15149-15158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) to determine whether p38γ and c-Jun cooperate to stimulate EGFR transcription through their binding to the EGFR promoter. Of great interest, p38γ is only significantly recruited to the EGFR promoter at an AP-1 site in K-Ras mutant, but not in K-Ras wild-type, cells, whereas c-Jun binds the same location independent of K-Ras mutation status (Fig. 3, B and C). Consistent with a mediating role for c-Jun in the p38γ/AP-1 promoter DNA binding (14.Loesch M. Zhi H.Y. Hou S.W. Qi X.M. Li R.S. Basir Z. Iftner T. Cuenda A. Chen G. p38γ MAPK cooperates with c-Jun in trans-activating matrix metalloproteinase 9.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 15149-15158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), p38γ immunoprecipitates from K-Ras mutant cells consistently contain higher levels of c-Jun (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that K-Ras mutation results in constitutive binding of p38γ to the EGFR promoter through its increased interaction with c-Jun. Furthermore, c-Jun depletion from K-Ras mutant cells not only decreases the growth and down-regulates EGFR expression, but also increases the growth-inhibitory activity of TKIs (supplemental Figs. S2 (A and C) and S3B). These results together indicate that K-Ras mutation can directly trigger p38γ binding to the EGFR promoter through its increased nuclear translocation in a c-Jun-dependent manner and that increased c-Jun in K-Ras mutant colon cancer cells is, at least in part, responsible for elevated EGFR expression and the unresponsiveness to TKIs. EGFR can be dephosphorylated by several phosphatases, including protein-tyrosine phosphatase TCPTP (36.Mattila E. Pellinen T. Nevo J. Vuoriluoto K. Arjonen A. Ivaska J.

We investigated whether adversity exposure in two groups of youth was associated with reduced empathy and whether deficits in emotion recognition mediated this association. Foster, rural poor, and comparison youth from Swaziland, Africa identified emotional expressions and rated their empathic concern for characters depicted in images showing positive, ambiguous, and negative scenes. Rural and foster youth perceived greater anger and happiness in the main characters in ambiguous and negative images than did comparison youth. Rural children also perceived less sadness. Youth’s perceptions of sadness in the negative and ambiguous expressions mediated the relation between adversity and empathic concern, but only for the rural youth, who perceived less sadness, which then predicted less empathy. Findings provide new insight into processes that underlie empathic tendencies in adversity-exposed youth and highlight potential directions for interventions to increase empathy."
https://openalex.org/W2736812595,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder producing a variety of motor and cognitive deficits with the causes remaining largely unknown. The gradual loss of the nigrostriatal pathway is currently considered the pivotal pathological event. To better understand the progression of PD and improve treatment management, defining the disease on a structural basis and expanding brain analysis to extra-nigral structures is indispensable. The anatomical complexity and the presence of neuromelanin, make the use of non-human primates an essential element in developing putative imaging biomarkers of PD. To this end, ex vivo T2-weighted magnetic resonance images were acquired from control and 1-methyl-4 phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated marmosets. Volume measurements of the caudate, putamen, and substantia nigra indicated significant atrophy and cortical thinning. Tensor-based morphometry provided a more extensive and hypothesis free assessment of widespread changes caused by the toxin insult to the brain, especially highlighting regional cortical atrophy. The results highlight the importance of developing imaging biomarkers of PD in non-human primate models considering their distinct neuroanatomy. It is essential to further develop these biomarkers in vivo to provide non-invasive tools to detect pre-symptomatic PD and to monitor potential disease altering therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2738757252,"Purpose and hypothesis Although sex- and gender-specific analyses have been gaining more attention during the last years they have rarely been performed in orthopaedic literature. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate whether for injuries of the UCL the specific location of the rupture is influenced by sex. A secondary study question addressed the sex-independent effect of trauma intensity on the rupture site of the UCL. Methods This study is a retrospective analysis of all patients with either a proximal or distal bony avulsion or with a mid-substance tear or ligament avulsion of the UCL treated surgically between 1992 and 2015 at two level-I trauma centres. Trauma mechanisms leading to the UCL injury were classified into the following categories: (1) blunt trauma (i.e., strains), (2) low-velocity injuries (e.g., fall from standing height, assaults), and (3) high-velocity injuries (e.g., sports injuries, motor vehicle accidents). After reviewing the surgical records, patients were divided into three groups, depending upon the ligament rupture site: (1) mid-substance tears, (2) proximal ligament or bony avulsions and (3) distal ligament or bony avulsions. Dependencies between the specific rupture site and the explanatory variables (sex, age, and trauma intensity) were evaluated using χ2 test and logistic regression analysis. Results In total, 1582 patients (1094 males, 488 females) met the inclusion criteria. Mean age was 41 years (range: 9–90 years). Taking into account the effects of sex on trauma intensity (p<0.001) and of trauma intensity on rupture site (p<0.001), mid-substance tears occurred more frequently in women, whereas men were more prone to distal ligament or bony avulsions (p<0.001). In other words, sex and rupture site correlated due to the effects of sex on trauma intensity and of trauma intensity on rupture site, but taking into account those effects there still was a significant effect of sex on rupture site. Conclusions The results of this study demonstrate that with regression analysis both sex and trauma intensity allow to predict rupture site in UCL injuries."
https://openalex.org/W2738295372,"Species A rotavirus non-structural protein 3 (NSP3) is a translational regulator that inhibits or, under some conditions, enhances host cell translation. NSP3 binds to the translation initiation factor eIF4G1 and evicts poly-(A) binding protein (PABP) from eIF4G1, thus inhibiting translation of polyadenylated mRNAs, presumably by disrupting the effect of PABP bound to their 3’-ends. NSP3 has a long coiled-coil region involved in dimerization that includes a chaperone Hsp90-binding domain (HS90BD). We aimed to study the role in NSP3 dimerization of a segment of the coiled-coil region adjoining the HS90BD. We used a vaccinia virus system to express NSP3 with point mutations in conserved amino acids in the coiled-coil region and determined the effects of these mutations on translation by metabolic labeling of proteins as well as on accumulation of stable NSP3 dimers by non-dissociating Western blot, a method that separates stable NSP3 dimers from the monomer/dimerization intermediate forms of the protein. Four of five mutations reduced the total yield of NSP3 and the formation of stable dimers (W170A, K171E, R173E and R187E:K191E), whereas one mutation had the opposite effects (Y192A). Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 revealed that stable NSP3 dimers and monomers/dimerization intermediates are susceptible to proteasome degradation. Surprisingly, mutants severely impaired in the formation of stable dimers were still able to inhibit host cell translation, suggesting that NSP3 dimerization intermediates are functional. Our results demonstrate that rotavirus NSP3 acquires its function prior to stable dimer formation and remain as a proteasome target throughout dimerization."
https://openalex.org/W2736426887,"Networks are powerful tools for the presentation and analysis of interactions in multi-component systems. A commonly studied mesoscopic feature of networks is their community structure, which arises from grouping together similar nodes into one community and dissimilar nodes into separate communities. Here, the community structure of protein sequence similarity networks is determined with a new method: Attribute Clustering Dependent Communities (ACDC). Sequence similarity has hitherto typically been quantified by the alignment score or its expectation value. However, pair alignments with the same score or expectation value cannot thus be differentiated. To overcome this deficiency, the method constructs, for pair alignments, an extended alignment metric, the link attribute vector, which includes the score and other alignment characteristics. Rescaling components of the attribute vectors qualitatively identifies a systematic variation of sequence similarity within protein superfamilies. The problem of community detection is then mapped to clustering the link attribute vectors, selection of an optimal subset of links and community structure refinement based on the partition density of the network. ACDC-predicted communities are found to be in good agreement with gold standard sequence databases for which the ""ground truth"" community structures (or families) are known. ACDC is therefore a community detection method for sequence similarity networks based entirely on pair similarity information. A serial implementation of ACDC is available from https://cmb.ornl.gov/resources/developments."
