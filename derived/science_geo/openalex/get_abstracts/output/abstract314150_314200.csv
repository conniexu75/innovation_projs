https://openalex.org/W2158097083,The oxygen isotope compositions (delta(18)O) of eclogitic xenoliths from the Roberts Victor kimberlite range from 2 to 8 per mil relative to SMOW (standard mean ocean water). This surprising variation appears to be due to fractional crystallization: the eclogites rich in oxygen-18 represent early crystal accumulates; the eclogites poor in oxygen-18 represent residual liquids. Crystal-melt partitioning probably exceeded 3 per mil and is interpreted to be pressure-dependent. Anomalous enrichment of oxygen-18 in cumulate eclogites relative to ultramafic xenoliths suggests that crystal-melt partitioning increased after melt-formation but prior to crystallization.

The existence of the sheets is apparently a finite amplitude manifestationl of a recently proposed viscous instability."
https://openalex.org/W2071951160,"Variations observed in the length of the day can be divided into three types: seasonal, irregular, and long-term. The astronomical data examined here for the years 1956-1969 suggest that the seasonal terms hitherto assumed are slightly in error, that the irregular variations probably share the same source with the seasonal variations, and that the long-term variations may be linked to earthquake activity."

A certain latent period occurs before the inhibition reaches a maximum and the drug is more effective at pH 7.8 than at pH 6.7. As is shown in the accompanying article by Dr. Kohn, this concentration is in the minimal effective range for the inhibition of growth. A latent period and a similar pH effect also are present when growth is inhibited. It is thus possible to conclude that propamidine, unlike sulfanilamide and its derivatives, directly affects the oxidative metabolism of these bacteria."
