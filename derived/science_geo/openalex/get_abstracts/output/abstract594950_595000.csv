We use single-cell RNA sequencing and signaling lineage reporters to generate a spatial and transcriptional map of the lung mesenchyme. We find that each mesenchymal lineage has a distinct spatial address and transcriptional profile leading to unique niche regulatory functions. The mesenchymal alveolar niche cell is Wnt responsive, expresses Pdgfrα, and is critical for alveolar epithelial cell growth and self-renewal. In contrast, the Axin2+ myofibrogenic progenitor cell preferentially generates pathologically deleterious myofibroblasts after injury. Analysis of the secretome and receptome of the alveolar niche reveals functional pathways that mediate growth and self-renewal of alveolar type 2 progenitor cells, including IL-6/Stat3, Bmp, and Fgf signaling.

In adult tissue, epithelial progenitors receive paracrine signals from the surrounding mesenchymal niche, and these signals can modulate the ability of epithelial progenitors to proliferate and differentiate. The mammalian lung comprises a myriad of specialized epithelial cells surrounded by a poorly defined heterogeneous mesenchyme. The lung mesenchymal compartment includes airway smooth muscle (ASM), vascular smooth muscle (VSM), endothelium, and poorly defined interstitial mesenchymal cells. In the lung alveolus, the alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell population, or subpopulations within it, is thought to be the predominant epithelial progenitor cell, capable of self-renewal and generating the alveolar type 1 (AT1) lineage after injury (Barkauskas et al., 2013Barkauskas C.E.

Multiple stromal populations contribute to pulmonary fibrosis without evidence for epithelial to mesenchymal transition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: E1475-E1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). AT2 and AT1 cells are thought to receive signals from the adjoining lung mesenchyme, which are important for both homeostasis and regeneration after injury. Different epithelial-mesenchymal interactions are likely to occur in the conducting airways, including those between basal stem cells, secretory cells, and the adjoining mesenchyme. However, like in most tissue, information on the identity, spatial distribution, and behavior of these mesenchymal lineages within the various progenitor cell niches in the lung is limited. The lung alveolar compartment is the primary site of gas exchange, the most fundamental function of the respiratory system. The lung alveolus forms a niche of interacting and communicating cell types including the AT1 and AT2 epithelial lineages, vascular endothelial cells, and poorly understood mesenchymal lineages. Previous work has suggested that AT2 cells are located near Pdgfrα+ mesenchymal cells, which promote AT2 self-renewal and differentiation into AT1 cells in ex vivo three-dimensional organoid cultures (Barkauskas et al., 2013Barkauskas C.E. Cronce M.J. Rackley C.R. Bowie E.J. Keene D.R. Stripp B.R. Randell S.H. Noble P.W. Hogan B.L. Type 2 alveolar cells are stem cells in adult lung.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 3025-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that spatially restricted alveolar niche signaling derived from the mesenchyme may influence AT2 cell behavior. Defining the identity and cell behavior of lung mesenchymal lineages is complicated by the architectural complexity of the respiratory system. Moreover, few cell-specific marker genes demarcate different mesenchymal lineages within the lung or most other adult tissues. Recent evidence has revealed a critical role for an epithelial-derived hedgehog signal in the regulation of airway-adjacent mesenchyme homeostasis and repair in the lung (Peng et al., 2015Peng T. Frank D.B. Kadzik R.S. Morley M.P. Rathi K.S. Wang T. Zhou S. Cheng L. Lu M.M. Morrisey E.E. Hedgehog actively maintains adult lung quiescence and regulates repair and regeneration.Nature. 2015; 526: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, there is little understanding or characterization of the different mesenchymal lineages and their respective abilities to promote homeostasis and regeneration in the lung alveolus or in most other tissue-specific niches. To identify and characterize the mesenchymal lineages that participate in and provide preferential signals to promote alveolar self-renewal and regeneration versus lineages and signals involved in an ineffective injury response, such as myofibroblast expansion, we have isolated and sorted the entirety of lung mesenchyme into five different cell lineages based on signal transduction pathway readouts. The use of signaling reporters allows for the characterization of cell lineages based on a functional readout, and combined with an unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing approach, we have begun to reveal mechanistic insights into the identified lineages. Each of these lineages has a specific spatial address and distinct transcriptional profile. From these studies, we identify a mesenchymal alveolar niche cell (MANC) that has unique capabilities in supporting alveolar growth and regeneration. We also identify a distinct and separate lineage called the Axin2+ myofibrogenic progenitor (AMP) cell, which is a major contributor to pathologically deleterious myofibroblasts, as well as airway smooth muscle cells after injury. Using high-resolution transcriptome data, we identify key signal transduction pathways that regulate lung alveolar epithelial self-renewal and differentiation including interleukin-6 (IL-6)/Stat3, Bmp, and Fgf signaling. These studies help to define the cellular, molecular, and spatial complexity and heterogeneity of two lung mesenchymal niches and identify paracrine pathways critical for promoting lung alveolar self-renewal versus deleterious tissue remodeling after injury. In doing so, we provide a roadmap for understanding the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions critical for adult tissue homeostasis and regeneration. We used a recently described Axin2CreERT2:tdT reporter line generated in our laboratory (Frank et al., 2016Frank D.B. Peng T. Zepp J.A. Snitow M. Vincent T.L. Penkala I.J. Cui Z. Herriges M.J.

Tian Y. Boogerd C.J. Lu M.M. Kadzik R.S. Stewart K.M. Evans S.M. Morrisey E.E. Coordination of heart and lung co-development by a multipotent cardiopulmonary progenitor.Nature. 2013; 500: 589-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and a PdgfrαEGFP reporter line (Hamilton et al., 2003Hamilton T.G. Klinghoffer R.A. Corrin P.D. Soriano P. Evolutionary divergence of platelet-derived growth factor alpha receptor signaling mechanisms.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4013-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), to deconvolute the complexity of the mesenchymal compartment in the adult lung by identifying the relative location and distribution of mesenchymal cells displaying Wnt or Pdgfr signaling activity and expression. Wnt-responsive Axin2+ cells can be found throughout the adult lung mesenchyme, in the alveolar regions, and in the surrounding conducting airways and blood vessels (Figures 1A–1D and S1A–S1D ). Many of the Axin2-derived cells in the alveolar niche expressed Pdgfrα whereas Axin2+ lineage-traced cells surrounding the airways primarily expressed Pdgfrβ (Figures 1E–1H). Using the Wnt2CreERT2 line crossed to a R26REYFP reporter (Wnt2CreERT2:R26REYFP), we demonstrate that Wnt2+ cells are exclusively located in the alveolar region of the lung (Figure 1I). Moreover, using immunostaining and Wnt2CreERT2:R26RtdT:Pdgfrα mice, we show that approximately 90% of Wnt2-expressing cells express Pdgfrα, but not Pdgfrβ (Figures 1J, 1K, 1L, and 1N). Finally, using the PdgfrαEGFP reporter line, we show that the majority of Pdgfrα+ cells are located in the alveolar region (Figures 1L, 1M and 1N). Approximately 74% of the Axin2 cells located in the alveolar region express Pdgfrα, whereas a majority of the Axin2 cells surrounding the airways do not (Figures 1M and 1N). These data suggest that alveolar mesenchymal cells are regionally distributed and can be divided into several distinct types based on their expression of Axin2, Wnt2, and Pdgfrα. Overall, the Axin2+/Pdgfrα+ (Axin2-Pα) cells and Wnt2+/Pdgfrα+ (Wnt2-Pα) cells are found in the alveolar region, whereas the Axin2+/Pdgfrα- (Axin2+) cells are primarily found in the surrounding airways or blood vessels, giving each of these different lineages a unique spatial address in the lung (Figure 1O).Figure S1Characterization of the Axin2 Mesenchymal Lineages, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Immunostaining shows that Axin2+ cells residing near airways do not express the smooth muscle marker SM22α.(B) Immunostaining shows that a small number of Axin2+ cells residing near blood vessels do express the smooth muscle marker αSMA.(C) Quantitation of the percent of Axin2+ cells surrounding airways or blood vessels that are αSMA+ or SM22+.(D) Efficiency of lineage tracing marks appoximately 44% of the Axin2+ cells (n = 3 mice).(E–G) For FACS isolation of lung mesenchyme, single cell suspensions were prepared for each lung.

To further assess the various mesenchymal cell types defined above, we performed population RNA sequencing (popRNA-seq) analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. To obtain deep sequencing of the five different cell populations identified above, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate these cells based on the presence or the absence of Axin2, Pdgfrα, and Wnt2 expression (Figures 2A and S1E–S1G). Of note, using these methods, we were able to isolate greater than 90% of the live Epcam−/CD31−/CD45− (lineage-negative) cell population in the lung, which compose the vast majority of the lung mesenchymal compartment (Figures S1H and S1I). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the popRNA-seq data revealed that all five populations exhibited significantly different transcriptomes (Figure 2B). An analysis of known mesenchymal markers, including signaling and structural genes in the popRNA-seq data, reveals that the “other” and Axin2+ cells exhibit characteristics of a smooth muscle, myofibroblast, or pericyte-like cell with enriched expression of genes, such as Acta2, Tagln, and Des (Figures 2D and S2A). Since fewer than 10% of the Axin2+ traced cells surrounding the airways or blood vessels express the smooth muscle marker SM22α or αSMA by immunohistochemistry (IHC), these data suggest that the Axin2+ cells may be primed for smooth muscle or myofibroblast gene expression, but are not yet committed to these differentiated lineages (Figures S1A–S1C). In contrast, Pdgfrα+, Axin2-Pα+, and Wnt2+ cells exhibited enriched expression of genes associated with matrix-producing fibroblasts found in the alveoli, such as Elastin (Eln), Pdgfrα (Pdgfra), and Collagen (Col1a1) (Figures 2D and S2A). Of note, cells in the “other” population express epithelial markers, such as Ager, Pdpn, and Cdh1, suggesting that this population may include cells that were not removed during the Epcam/CD31/CD45− sort to purify mesenchymal cells (Figure 2D). We also subjected the entire lung mesenchymal population to in-Drop scRNA-seq analysis (Figure 2A). Assessment of the scRNA-seq data from 5,572 lung mesenchymal cells revealed t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE)-based clustering into five distinct groups, each consisting of more than 90 cells (Figures 2C and S2B). Expression of some candidate mesenchymal markers showed that clusters 4 and 5 contained the majority of Pdgfrα+ cells, whereas clusters 2 and 3 contained the majority of Acta2-, Tagln-, and Des-expressing cells (Figures S2B and S2C). Pdgfrβ was expressed in clusters 2, 3, and 4, and Col1a1 was broadly expressed in all clusters (Figure S2C). Analysis of the most highly expressed genes in each cluster shows that cluster 5 represents epithelial cells that were not removed using FACS isolation (Figure S2D). To test whether these five groups from the scRNA-seq were analogous to those found in our popRNA-seq analysis, we identified hallmark genes from the popRNA-seq dataset that clearly demarcated the five different groups of cells (Figure 2D). The Axin2-Pα+ cells expressed multiple inhibitors of Wnt signaling, including Wif1 and Sfrp4, indicating that Wnt signaling is finely regulated in these cells and their neighboring cells. In contrast, Axin2+ cells were enriched for genes indicative of a myofibroblast lineage including Acta2 and Aoc3, a myofibroblast marker expressed in dermal mesenchyme (Hsia et al., 2016Hsia L.T. Ashley N. Ouaret D. Wang L.M. Wilding J. Bodmer W.F. Myofibroblasts are distinguished from activated skin fibroblasts by the expression of AOC3 and other associated markers.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: E2162-E2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Aoc3 expression is confined to the mesenchyme surrounding the parabronchial airways (Figure S2E). Expression of Notch3 and Gucy1a3, a receptor and Notch target gene highly expressed in pericytes and vascular smooth muscle (Figure 2D) (Chang et al., 2011Chang A.C. Fu Y. Garside V.C. Niessen K.

The Wnt2+ cells displayed unique expression of Nebl, a cardiac Z-disk protein that has also been shown to be significantly downregulated in human IPF lung tissue, and may represent vestigial remnants of the primordial cardio-pulmonary progenitor ontogeny of the Wnt2-expressing lineage (Bauer et al., 2015Bauer Y.

Coordination of heart and lung co-development by a multipotent cardiopulmonary progenitor.Nature. 2013; 500: 589-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We overlaid these signature genes onto the scRNA-seq analysis using the 10X Genomics software. This analysis revealed that the distinct mesenchymal cell types identified by functional reporter readouts represent distinct clusters derived from the unbiased parallel scRNA-seq approach with Axin2+ cells represented by cluster 4 (C4), Axin2-Pα+ cells represented by cluster 2 (C2), and Wnt2+ cells represented by cluster 1 (C1) (Figure 2E). Thus, the Axin2-Pα+, Axin2+, and Wnt2+ cells exhibit unique transcriptomes identifiable through the use of both scRNA-seq and popRNA-seq analysis, which suggest that these cells represent distinct lineages with potentially unique cell behaviors in the lung. The AT2 lineage is thought to harbor a resident epithelial progenitor of the lung alveolus due to its capability to self-renew and differentiate into AT1 cells after injury (Barkauskas et al., 2013Barkauskas C.E.

Multiple stromal populations contribute to pulmonary fibrosis without evidence for epithelial to mesenchymal transition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: E1475-E1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). To determine which of the mesenchymal lineages defined above helps to form the alveolar niche with the AT2 cell population, we developed a spatial distance mapping (SDM) algorithm using the AT2 cell as an anchor point (Figure 3A). This allowed us to define a distinct spatial address for each of the mesenchymal lineages we have identified. SDM is based on identification of the relative location of lineage reported cell types to Sftpc-expressing AT2 cells using confocal microscopy-based three-dimensional rendering to measure nuclei-nuclei distance using DAPI staining (Figure 3B). Using SDM, the Axin2+ lineage was found to be preferentially located closest to AT2 cells versus either the Pdgfrα+ or Wnt2+ lineages (Figures 3C–3G). Next, we tested whether Axin2-Pα+ lineage, which has a distinct transcriptome, were found in a unique spatial arrangement in relation to AT2 cells. These analyses revealed that the Axin2-Pα+ lineage is located closer to AT2 cells, compared to the Axin2+/Pα- lineage (Figures 3H and 3I). Given their preferential close proximity to AT2 cells, these data suggest that the Axin2-Pα+ mesenchymal lineage is a critical component of the alveolar niche that may preferentially communicate with AT2 cells (Figure 3J). Previous studies have shown that mesenchymal cells are necessary for alveolar organoid development in vitro, indicating the importance of mesenchymal-epithelial signaling in alveolar growth (Barkauskas et al., 2013Barkauskas C.E. Cronce M.J. Rackley C.R. Bowie E.J. Keene D.R. Stripp B.R. Randell S.H. Noble P.W. Hogan B.L. Type 2 alveolar cells are stem cells in adult lung.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 3025-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). To determine which of the mesenchymal lineages identified preferentially promote alveolar cell growth and self-renewal, alveolar organoid assays were performed using mature AT2 cells isolated from SftpcCreERT2:R26REYFP adult mice (Barkauskas et al., 2013Barkauskas C.E. Cronce M.J. Rackley C.R. Bowie E.J. Keene D.R. Stripp B.R. Randell S.H. Noble P.W. Hogan B.L. Type 2 alveolar cells are stem cells in adult lung.J. Clin.

Integrin α6β4 identifies an adult distal lung epithelial population with regenerative potential in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 2855-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The five different mesenchymal lineages or populations were combined with AT2 cells to form organoids and were subsequently counted, sectioned for IHC, and isolated for gene expression analysis (Figure 4A). Whereas organoids visibly formed in the presence of all the different mesenchymal cell types, except for the lineage-negative “other” cell population, the Axin2-Pα lineage generated a significantly greater number of organoids than any other lineage (Figures 4B and 4C). The organoids generated using the Axin2-Pα lineage were also larger in size than those generated by the other mesenchymal cell types (Figure 4D). Consistent with the increased colony formation, the expression of Sftpc and Aqp5 was also significantly increased in the Axin2-Pα co-culture condition (Figures 4E and 4F). To evaluate AT2 to AT1 differentiation, we analyzed the ratio of AT1 (Hopx+ nuclei) to AT2 (Sftpc+) cells within the mature organoids. These data reveal a greater AT1/AT2 ratio in the presence of the Axin2-Pα+ lineage versus the other lineages, suggesting that this lineage not only promotes better growth but also differentiation into AT1 cells (Figures 4G and 4H). Together, these data identify the Axin2-Pα+ lineage as a MANC, which is preferentially capable of promoting AT2 cell self-renewal and differentiation in AT1 cells (Figure 4I). Lung fibrosis is a chronic and progressive disease that ultimately leads to respiratory failure and death in the absence of organ transplant. Although our data show that MANC lineage is a critical component of the alveolar niche that preferentially promotes AT2 cell growth, we wanted to identify which of the identified lineages preferentially contributed toward the deleterious fibrotic response to injury. Although there are no mouse models of lung fibrosis that recapitulate all of the hallmarks of the human disease, bleomycin injury does lead to a transient fibrotic response consisting of increased numbers of αSMA+ myofibroblasts in the alveolar region, similar to some of the pathology observed in human lung fibrosis (Adamson and Bowden, 1974Adamson I.Y.

USA. 2011; 108: E1475-E1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). To determine which of the lineages we identified preferentially contribute toward the αSMA+ myofibroblast response after bleomycin injury, we performed lineage tracing analysis using the Axin2CreERT2:tdT, PdgfraCreERT2 and Wnt2CreERT2 mice and the R26REYFP reporter. Recombination was induced in all three lineages and intra-tracheal instillation of bleomycin was performed to injure the lungs and induce fibrotic remodeling. After 21 days, αSMA+ myofibroblasts were quantified from each of these lineage-tracing experiments (Figure 5A). Although all three lineages generated αSMA+ cells, the Axin2 lineage contributed to nearly half of the myofibroblasts, whereas less than 20% were derived from either the Wnt2 or the Pdgfrα lineages (Figures 5B–5E). Of note, there were no detectable αSMA+ lineage-traced myofibroblasts in the alveolar region of control animals using any of these reporters (Figure 5E). Importantly, many myofibroblasts maintain expression of Axin2, but they express little or no Pdgfrα (Figures 5F–5H). To determine whether bleomycin induced lung injury would cause trans-differentiation of the lung mesenchymal lineages we have identified, we assessed Acta2 expression and changes in population numbers during early myofibrogenic (day 7 post-bleomycin) and later resolution time points (day 21). At day 7 post-bleomycin, FACS-purified Axin2+ cells significantly upregulated the expression of Acta2, whereas MANCs did not (Figure 5I). Consistent with the significant tissue damage, the overall numbers of Axin2+ cells and MANCs were reduced at day 7 (Figure 5J). However, by day 21, MANCs, but not Axin2+ cells, rebounded in cell number (Figure 5J). Consistent with this we observed increased proliferation in Pdgfrα-expressing cells relative to αSMA+ cells (Figures 5K–5M). To further address cell plasticity among the identified lineages, we tested whether bleomycin injury caused Wnt2+ cells to acquire increased Axin2 expression. Prior to injury approximately 30% of Wnt2+ cells express Axin2 using the Axin2lacZ reporter (Figures S3A–S3C). After bleomycin injury, this percentage was not significantly altered (Figure S3C). These data suggest that Wnt2+ cells do not significantly alter Axin2 expression after acute lung injury. The ability of Axin2+ cells to upregulate Acta2 and differentiate into myofibroblasts after bleomycin injury and their relative inability to support AT2 cell growth in organoids suggests that they are an AMP cell. Together, these data demonstrate the existence of at least two distinct mesenchyme lineages within the alveolar region: MANCs, which are a critical component of the alveolar niche that promotes AT2 cell self-renewal and proliferates after acute lung injury, and AMP cells, which contribute toward the deleterious myofibroblast trans-differentiation after injury (Figure 5N). The Axin2+ cells surrounding the airways are interdigitated within the parabronchial smooth muscle layer, yet most do not express αSMA (Figures 6A, 6B, and S1A). Despite a lack of αSMA immunoreactivity in the AMP cell lineage, transcriptome analysis indicates the preferential expression of myogenic genes, suggesting that AMP cells may act as progenitors of smooth muscle. To determine whether AMP cells located in the underlying bronchiolar airways could generate parabronchial smooth muscle after airway injury, we performed lineage tracing using the Axin2CreERT2:tdT and PdgfrαCreERT2 mouse lines in the context of naphthalene based airway epithelial injury.

https://openalex.org/W2739636520,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a pivotal role in the inhibition of anti-tumor immune responses. Understanding the mechanisms governing Treg homeostasis may therefore be important for development of effective tumor immunotherapy. We have recently demonstrated a key role for the canonical nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) subunits, p65 and c-Rel, in Treg identity and function. In this report, we show that NF-κB c-Rel ablation specifically impairs the generation and maintenance of the activated Treg (aTreg) subset, which is known to be enriched at sites of tumors. Using mouse models, we demonstrate that melanoma growth is drastically reduced in mice lacking c-Rel, but not p65, in Tregs. Moreover, chemical inhibition of c-Rel function delayed melanoma growth by impairing aTreg-mediated immunosuppression and potentiated the effects of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Our studies therefore establish inhibition of NF-κB c-Rel as a viable therapeutic approach for enhancing checkpoint-targeting immunotherapy protocols."

The directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) offers a model system to access early fate decisions in a systematic manner for applications in basic and translational biology. Several strategies exist to differentiate PSCs into early lineages such as spontaneous differentiation paradigms and directed differentiation strategies based on the in vitro modulation of developmental pathways known to act during development in vivo (Suzuki and Vanderhaeghen, 2015Suzuki I.K.

Factors that greatly affect outcome across various differentiation platforms include the use of feeder cells, monolayer versus embryoid-body (EB)-based strategies, or complex media compositions. For example, many published protocols involve media containing serum or serum-replacement factors such as KSR (knockout serum replacement) for deriving a desired fate. Batch-to-batch variability in the manufacturing of those reagents affects reproducibility of differentiation, making it often necessary to pursue laborious lot testing in order to generate specific cell types of interest (Blauwkamp et al., 2012Blauwkamp T.A.

While such extensive quality control strategies for complex reagents such as KSR are feasible for any single protocol, they prevent the development of more ambitious strategies aimed at generating dozens or possibly hundreds of defined cell types in a modular fashion. Our lab has established protocols to derive multiple cell types of the nervous system based on the addition of LDN193189 and SB431542 (SB), small molecules that inhibit the BMP and TGFβ signaling pathways, respectively. This inhibitory cocktail combination, termed dual SMAD inhibition (dSMADi), allows the efficient generation of cells in the central nervous system (CNS) defaulting toward an anterior neuroectoderm (NE) marked by expression of the transcription factor PAX6 (Chambers et al., 2009Chambers S.M. Fasano C.A. Papapetrou E.P. Tomishima M. Sadelain M. Studer L. Highly efficient neural conversion of human ES and iPS cells by dual inhibition of SMAD signaling.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar). Modifications of dSMADi can yield many different neural subtypes along the neuraxis of the embryo, including forebrain, midbrain, and spinal cord progenitors (Suzuki and Vanderhaeghen, 2015Suzuki I.K.

In addition, dSMADi can be adapted to generate non-CNS cell types such as neural crest (NC) (Menendez et al., 2011Menendez L. Yatskievych T.A. Antin P.B. Dalton S.

Piao J. Niu L. Ganat Y. Kriks S. Zimmer B. Shi S.H. Tabar V. Studer L.

Biol. 2013; 379: 208-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Overall, dSMADi is a robust and widely used platform that will generate a near homogeneous layer of PAX6+ NE. However, even when deriving PAX6+ NE under dSMADi, the acquisition of the most anterior, telencephalic marker FOXG1+ in PAX6+ cells can be affected by KSR batch variability, a problem that may necessitate the addition of an indirect inhibitor of the WNT signaling pathway (XAV09393) to fully restore telencephalic fate potential (Maroof et al., 2013Maroof A.M. Keros S. Tyson J.A. Ying S.W. Ganat Y.M. Merkle F.T. Liu B. Goulburn A. Stanley E.G. Elefanty A.G. et al.Directed differentiation and functional maturation of cortical interneurons from human embryonic stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 12: 559-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Therefore, a scalable and fully modular differentiation platform should be devoid of KSR or other complex media factors. Here we set out to establish such a defined platform to access in parallel all major ectodermal lineages (CNS-NE, NC, CP, and NNE). Recently, several alternative base media have been developed that are chemically defined and generated with fewer components. In particular, the development of the Essential 8 (E8) media enables maintenance of hPSCs with just eight defined compounds and the lack of any animal proteins (Chen et al., 2011Chen G. Gulbranson D.R. Hou Z. Bolin J.M. Ruotti V. Probasco M.D. Smuga-Otto K. Howden S.E. Diol N.R. Propson N.E. et al.Chemically defined conditions for human iPSC derivation and culture.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). In addition, removal of two components, namely TGFβ1 and FGF2, triggers spontaneous differentiation of hPSCs. Transition from E8 to Essential 6 (E6) can give rise to PAX6+ NE without the addition of any small-molecule inhibitors (Lippmann et al., 2014Lippmann E.S. Estevez-Silva M.C. Ashton R.S. Defined human pluripotent stem cell culture enables highly efficient neuroepithelium derivation without small molecule inhibitors.Stem Cells. 2014; 32: 1032-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), though addition of TGFβ signaling inhibitors greatly improves speed and efficiency of neural fate acquisition. In this report, we have formulated a directed differentiation system to derive in parallel and with high purity all major ectodermal lineages from human PSCs under fully defined media conditions. We apply these differentiation strategies to pursue proof-of-concept studies that either address the effects of genetic perturbation experiments on the entire set of ectodermal lineages (rather than on a specific lineage) or demonstrate the feasibility of chemical screening to identify molecules that further enhance differentiation toward specific ectodermal fates. The efficiency and versatility of the differentiation platform represents an important step toward the long-term goal of establishing modular directed differentiation conditions to access any human cell type from PSCs on demand in vitro. The four major ectodermal lineages comprise the NE, NC, CP, and NNE. Each of those lineages can be generated by the modification of dSMADi conditions using traditional KSR-based protocols as summarized in Figure S1A. Under KSR conditions, the optimal time point to include or subtract patterning factors is at 48 hr post induction (Dincer et al., 2013Dincer Z. Piao J. Niu L. Ganat Y. Kriks S. Zimmer B. Shi S.H.

At this time point, continuation with dSMADi generates anterior NE, activation of WNT signaling with CHIR99021 generates cranial NC, removal of the BMP inhibitor LDN193189 generates CP, or blockage of FGF signaling with SU5402 in combination with LDN193189 removal triggers NNE fates. Defined transcription factors and other lineage-specific markers can be used to uniquely identify each of the early ectodermal lineages. The generation of NE is marked by the expression of SOX1 and PAX6 and the absence of Transcription Factor AP2α (TFAP2A). The expression of TFAP2A in combination with the presence or absence of SOX10 and SIX1 separates the ectoderm from the NNE-derived cell types. In combination with TFAP2A, expression of SOX10 versus SIX1 specifically marks NC versus CP identity, respectively. It remains unclear if there is a specific transcription factor for NNE; however, the expression of TFAP2A in the absence of both SOX10 and SIX1 appears to reliably identify NNE under those culture conditions (Figure S1B). To monitor the acquisition of those various ectodermal lineage markers in defined differentiation media, we used three GFP reporter lines, PAX6::H2B-GFP (Figures S1C–S1F), SOX10::GFP (Chambers et al., 2012Chambers S.M. Qi Y. Mica Y. Lee G. Zhang X.J. Niu L. Bilsland J. Cao L. Stevens E.

Differentiation of the lines under KSR-based conditions into specific cell types produced an average of 95%, 50%, and 58% of NE, CP, and NC, respectively (Figures S1I and S1J). Although overall differentiation efficiencies were quite high, the yield of CP and NC cells was variable across repeat differentiations, suggesting that certain factors in the KSR-based conditions may vary and thereby affect yield. Furthermore, when the regional patterning of the NE was assessed, the expression of PAX6 and SOX1 was very robust (Figure S1I), but the anterior marker FOXG1 was variable even with WNT inhibition in one of the KSR batches tested (Figure S1J), implying that KSR contains components that can alter regional identity during differentiation. To transition these protocols into the more defined E6 media, we adapted hPSCs in E8 for multiple passages and initially replaced simply the KSR-based medium with an E6-based differentiation while maintaining factors and concentrations as described previously to trigger the four major ectodermal lineages (Figure 1A). We found that the original concentrations for some of the small molecules, namely CHIR99021 and SU5402, effectively killed the cells during differentiation and had to be re-titrated (data not shown). After determining an optimal non-toxic concentration for each of the small molecules, we observed that NE formation under E6 conditions was equivalent to that obtained with KSR-based conditions. The formation of NE in the absence of small molecules under E6 conditions was demonstrated previously (Lippmann et al., 2014Lippmann E.S. Estevez-Silva M.C. Ashton R.S. Defined human pluripotent stem cell culture enables highly efficient neuroepithelium derivation without small molecule inhibitors.Stem Cells. 2014; 32: 1032-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We compared the efficiency of generating PAX6+ cells using no small molecules, using dSMADi, or using the single TGFβ inhibitor SB. We found upregulation of PAX6 expression in the absence of dSMADi (∼40% of total cells on day 12 post induction). However, the percentage of cells expressing PAX6 was further improved upon the addition of SB or complete dSMADi to nearly 90% and 80%, respectively (Figure S2A). PAX6+ NE can efficiently form neural rosettes (Figure S2B) that can be further differentiated into TBR1+ cortical neurons (Figure S2C), indicating that these cells can progress through the early stages of cortical development. Upon further culture (day 50 of differentiation), the resulting neurons displayed responsiveness to glutamate treatment as shown by calcium imaging (Figure S2D). Surprisingly, high percentages of PAX6+ cells were observed in nearly all the treatment groups including in cells maintained under CP or NNE conditions (Figure 1B). Although CP cells can express PAX6, these cells did not co-express SIX1, suggesting that they are not of CP origin. Additionally, NC induction did not generate either PAX6 or SOX10+ cells efficiently (Figures S2E and S2F), suggesting that WNT activation may alter the regional identity of differentiating, putative NE cells rather than inducing NC. Finally, a comparative gene expression analysis of hPSCs differentiated toward NC under KSR versus E6 conditions revealed a lack of non-neural marker expression under E6 (Figure S2G). Overall, the data suggest that E6 lacked factors to induce non-neural fates under the small-molecule conditions developed for KSR-based differentiations. In order to understand why most ectodermal lineage protocols failed to induce non-neural fates, we investigated the induction of TFAP2A. TFAP2A is highly expressed in NC, CP, and NNE and is upregulated within a few days of differentiation, preceding the expression of other lineage-restricted markers such as SOX10 and SIX1 for NC and CP, respectively (Dincer et al., 2013Dincer Z. Piao J. Niu L. Ganat Y. Kriks S. Zimmer B. Shi S.H. Tabar V. Studer L. Specification of functional cranial placode derivatives from human pluripotent stem cells.Cell Rep. 2013; 5: 1387-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Many signaling molecules have been reported to induce the expression of TFAP2A such as retinoids and activators of WNT and BMP signaling (Luo et al., 2003Luo T. Lee Y.H. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Sargent T.D. Induction of neural crest in Xenopus by transcription factor AP2alpha.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, Xie et al., 1998Xie W.F. Kondo S. Sandell L.J. Regulation of the mouse cartilage-derived retinoic acid-sensitive protein gene by the transcription factor AP-2.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5026-5032Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, under KSR conditions, none of those signaling factors were directly added during induction of the non-CNS fates despite robust TFAP2A expression (Dincer et al., 2013Dincer Z. Piao J. Niu L. Ganat Y. Kriks S. Zimmer B. Shi S.H. Tabar V. Studer L. Specification of functional cranial placode derivatives from human pluripotent stem cells.Cell Rep. 2013; 5: 1387-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that KSR-based media could trigger endogenous signals sufficient for the induction of TFAP2A, while E6 lacks those factors. Accordingly, we attempted to restore TFAP2A expression by directly adding relevant signaling molecules. BMP signaling has been shown to be important for the formation of NNE and placode (Figure 1C) (Groves and LaBonne, 2014Groves A.K. LaBonne C. Setting appropriate boundaries: fate, patterning and competence at the neural plate border.Dev. Biol. 2014; 389: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We sought to induce the expression of TFAP2A and subsequently suppress CNS differentiation by extrinsic stimulation of BMP signaling. We observed that TFAP2A expression is rapidly upregulated within 3 days of treatment with BMP4 in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 1D and 1E). At a high concentration (20 ng/ml), cells become TFAP2A+ and lack expression of SOX10 and SIX1, implying that NNE is triggered by strong BMP signaling activation (Figure 1F). Additional inhibition of the FGF pathway further blocks CP induction and thereby increases the efficiency of NNE induction (data not shown). When subjecting NNE to terminal differentiation toward keratinocytes using defined conditions, we were able to attain both immature (K14+) and mature (K18+) epidermal cells (Figure 1G). These data suggest that BMP4 signaling is able to rapidly induce NNE formation. We next asked whether a 3-day pulse of BMP signaling was sufficient to generate SIX1+ placode. Indeed, the addition of BMPs triggered placode induction, but at low efficiencies (Figures 2A and S3A). Dose-response studies showed that moderate concentrations of BMP4 (around 5 ng/ml) are optimal for CP induction. Intriguingly, the majority of the cells during placode differentiation resembled NNE, indicating that the direct addition of FGF agonists may be necessary to boost the efficiency of placode generation at the expense of NNE. Indeed, the addition of FGF2, but not FGF8, during the differentiation enhanced the formation of SIX1+ cells to nearly 50% (Figure 2B). It has previously been shown that in KSR-based media the trigeminal placode is the default placode fate derived from hPSCs (Dincer et al., 2013Dincer Z. Piao J. Niu L. Ganat Y. Kriks S. Zimmer B. Shi S.H. Tabar V. Studer L. Specification of functional cranial placode derivatives from human pluripotent stem cells.Cell Rep. 2013; 5: 1387-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We terminally differentiated the SIX1+ CP and observed expression of the anterior placode marker PAX6 and SIX3 (Figure 2C). Expression of PAX6 in placode cells is compatible with lens, pituitary, or olfactory identity. Further differentiation of these cells demonstrated expression of SIX3, CRYAA, and CRYAB by immunocytochemistry and suggests that the initial placode identity is likely corresponding to anterior lens rather than the posterior trigeminal placode (Figures 2D and 2E). Interestingly, these data are in agreement with work in the chick embryo suggesting that lens is the default placode during in vivo development (Bailey et al., 2006Bailey A.P. Bhattacharyya S. Bronner-Fraser M. Streit A. Lens specification is the ground state of all sensory placodes, from which FGF promotes olfactory identity.Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 505-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We next sought to identify factors that promote the derivation of trigeminal placode at the expense of lens placode since these factors are likely in KSR and not in E6. During development, trigeminal placode is induced posterior to the PAX6+ lens, pituitary, and olfactory placode. Therefore, we tested whether activation of canonical WNT signaling, known to trigger posterior cell identity during development, may be sufficient to shift patterning toward the trigeminal lineage. Exposure to an additional pulse of CHIR99021 during the early stages of differentiation, after the placode-inducing BMP treatment, was capable of triggering PAX3+ and PAX6− expression in placode cells compatible with trigeminal placode fate (Figure 2E). These data show that under minimal media conditions, we were able to closely recapitulate in vivo cell fate choices and regional specification during in vitro placode induction. Intriguingly, we also observed that activation of WNT signaling in combination with a short pulse of low dose BMP4 (1 ng/ml) was capable of generating a nearly homogeneous SOX10+ NC population (Figures 2F and S3B). At this concentration of BMP4, TFAP2A is induced only weakly, suggesting that NC may initially arise from early precursor cells expressing no or low levels of TFAP2A. However, the addition of both WNT and BMP acts synergistically to activate TFAP2A as well as DLX3, another marker of NNE fates (Figure 2G). Furthermore, the spontaneous differentiation of the NC can give rise to neurons that express ASCL1 or ISL1, which is compatible with autonomic and sensory neuron fates, respectively (Figure 2H), and the resulting neurons are functionally active upon prolonged culture (Figure 2I). The data presented here demonstrate that an early, dose-dependent induction of BMP signaling allows the formation of the non-CNS ectoderm fates, including NC, several of which are formed with greater efficiencies and lower variability than previously reported. To address the robustness of the protocol across cell lines, we assessed seven additional ESC/iPSC lines and quantified yield of ectodermal lineages using validated antibodies. Each PSC line was capable of inducing appropriate markers for a particular differentiated lineage, but with varying degrees of efficiency (Figures 3A and 3B ). Demarcation of CNS and non-CNS lineages is marked by the expression of TFAP2A. The percentages of TFAP2A+ cells ranged from 0%–5% without treatment with BMP4 and 56%–95% with the addition of BMP4 in the cell types tested. The generation of anterior NE from the various lines displayed efficiencies ranging from 67% to 95% (FOXG1) and 56% to 91% (PAX6). NC displayed 30%–58% (SOX10) and CP displayed 10%–45% (SIX1). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the defined culture conditions allow access to all the various NNE ectodermal fates across hPSC lines. The four ectodermal lineages represent a typically transient stage during early development and obtaining large numbers of human cells at a highly defined stage is difficult. Typically, our reporter lines are utilized to distinguish a particular cell type; however, PAX6 can be found in both NE and CP and SOX10 can be found in both NC and otic placodes (Taylor and Labonne, 2005Taylor K.M. Labonne C. SoxE factors function equivalently during neural crest and inner ear development and their activity is regulated by SUMOylation.Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We next sought to determine transcriptional expression signatures from purified cells of each of the four ectodermal lineages. With the exception of the NNE lineage, we sorted GFP+ cells using the respective reporter lines (all lines were derived from WA-09 hESCs) and performed RNA sequencing in those purified cells. Unbiased clustering algorithms showed that NE clustered closely with hESCs, while NNE clustered the furthest apart from all other ectodermal lineages. Interestingly, based on principle component analysis, NC and CP clustered closely to each other, suggesting that these cells have similar transcriptional profiles (Figures 4A and 4B ), despite our efforts in isolating pure NC and CP based on single markers such as SOX10 and SIX1, respectively. Differentially expressed genes were then grouped into those with shared and unique expression profiles (Figure 4C). Such expression patterns were further subjected to gene ontology analysis (Edgar et al., 2013Edgar R. Mazor Y. Rinon A. Blumenthal J. Golan Y. Buzhor E. Livnat I. Ben-Ari S. Lieder I. Shitrit A. et al.LifeMap Discovery™: the embryonic development, stem cells, and regenerative medicine research portal.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e66629Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Figure 4D). Genes associated with ECM reorganization were significantly enriched in all non-CNS-derived cell types. This implies that the early BMP signal during the differentiation may act in part through ECM or at least induces cell types enriched for ECM-related transcripts. Conversely, ontologies associated with NE involve synaptic transmission and nervous system development. Individual ontologies specific for NC include cell adhesion and calcium binding while CP was enriched for synaptic transmission and ion membrane transport. Taken together, the transcriptional expression profiles for the four ectodermal lineages are globally distinct and capture functions associated with each of the specific lineages represented. Given the paucity of early human ectodermal lineage data, we next asked whether we could identify more specific markers for each of the ectodermal lineages. Transcripts with significant differential expression among ectodermal lineages as well as uniquely upregulated genes were subjected to further validation. Genes specifically upregulated during ectoderm differentiation that are shared between the CNS and non-CNS fates include ANXA1, LGI1, NR2F2, and ZNF503. Additionally, factors that delineate non-CNS versus CNS are NEUROG1, HAND1, TFAP2A, and TFAP2B (Figure 4E). Not surprisingly, in the NE, factors such as SOX1 and HES5 exclusively identify cells of the CNS while low-level PAX6 transcripts could be found in all other lineages (Figure 4F). Interestingly, we observed high expression of the uncharacterized zinc finger protein ZNF229 specifically in the NC lineage. As for other lineages, we identified ELAVL4 and SMYD1 to be preferentially expressed in placode and NNE, respectively (Figure 4F). Furthermore, we compared our NC dataset to a previously published study focused on identifying NC in chick (Simoes-Costa and Bronner, 2016Simoes-Costa M. Bronner M.E. Reprogramming of avian neural crest axial identity and cell fate.Science. 2016; 352: 1570-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Of the genes significantly enriched in the NC, we found significant overlap (p = 3.56 × 10−7) between the two datasets (reflecting key conserved NC markers; Figures S4C and S4D). Interestingly, some candidate markers in our study such as ZNF229 are not conserved in the mouse, complicating validation studies. Nevertheless, comparative studies of our datasets, in particular for CP and NNE, would be valuable once additional, appropriate primary cell data become available. We validated expression of selected lineage markers from the genomics analysis in the additional PSC lines described above. For a subset of the genes we also assessed expression by immunocytochemistry and high content imaging. We found that, although by RNA, the expression of several genes seemed to be present in multiple lineages, by protein analysis those markers were selectively expressed. SOX1 and ZBTB16 (PLZF) were indeed primarily"
https://openalex.org/W2752989392,"Directed reprogramming of human fibroblasts into fully differentiated neurons requires massive changes in epigenetic and transcriptional states. Induction of a chromatin environment permissive for acquiring neuronal subtype identity is therefore a major barrier to fate conversion. Here we show that the brain-enriched miRNAs miR-9/9∗ and miR-124 (miR-9/9∗-124) trigger reconfiguration of chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, and mRNA expression to induce a default neuronal state. miR-9/9∗-124-induced neurons (miNs) are functionally excitable and uncommitted toward specific subtypes but possess open chromatin at neuronal subtype-specific loci, suggesting that such identity can be imparted by additional lineage-specific transcription factors. Consistently, we show that ISL1 and LHX3 selectively drive conversion to a highly homogeneous population of human spinal cord motor neurons. This study shows that modular synergism between miRNAs and neuronal subtype-specific transcription factors can drive lineage-specific neuronal reprogramming, providing a general platform for high-efficiency generation of distinct subtypes of human neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2750655834,"In this study, we present a fully-coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) framework that combines smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and nonlinear finite element (FE) method to investigate the coupled aortic and mitral valves structural response and the bulk intraventricular hemodynamics in a realistic left ventricle (LV) model during the entire cardiac cycle. The FSI model incorporates valve structures that consider native asymmetric leaflet geometries, anisotropic hyperelastic material models and human material properties. Comparison of FSI results with subject-specific echocardiography data demonstrates that the SPH-FE approach is able to quantitatively predict the opening and closing times of the valves, the mitral leaflet opening and closing angles, and the large-scale intraventricular flow phenomena with a reasonable agreement. Moreover, comparison of FSI results with a LV model without valves reveals substantial differences in the flow field. Peak systolic velocities obtained from the FSI model and the LV model without valves are 2.56 m/s and 1.16 m/s, respectively, compared to the Doppler echo data of 2.17 m/s. The proposed SPH-FE FSI framework represents a further step towards modeling patient-specific coupled LV-valve dynamics, and has the potential to improve our understanding of cardiovascular physiology and to support professionals in clinical decision-making."

For piscivorous fishes that swallow prey whole, feeding performance has traditionally been linked to three key morphological constraints: oral gape, pharyngeal gape, and the cleithral gape. However, other constraints may be important. We therefore examine 18 potential morphological constraints related to prey capture and processing, on four predatory species (Cephalopholis urodeta, Paracirrhites forsteri, Pterois volitans, Lates calcarifer). Aquarium-based experiments were then carried out to determine capture and processing behaviour and maximum prey size in two focal species, C. urodeta and P. forsteri. All four species showed a progressive decrease in gape measurements from anterior to posterior with oral gape ≥ buccal ≥ pharyngeal ≥ pectoral girdle ≥ esophagus ≥ stomach. C. urodeta was able to process prey with a maximum depth of 27% of the predators' standard length; for P. forsteri it was 20%. C. urodeta captured prey head-first in 79% of successful strikes. In P. forsteri head-first was 16.6%, mid-body 44.4%, and tail-first 38.8%. Regardless of capture mode, prey were almost always swallowed head first and horizontally in both focal species. Most internal measurements appeared too small for prey to pass through. This may reflect the compressibility of prey, i.e. their ability to be dorsoventrally compressed during swallowing movements. Despite examining all known potential morphological constraints on prey size, horizontal maxillary oral gape in a mechanically stretched position appears to be the main morphological variable that is likely to affect maximum prey size and resource use by these predatory species."
https://openalex.org/W2752052027,"Objective assessment methods to monitor residual limb volume following lower-limb amputation are required to enhance practitioner-led prosthetic fitting. Computer aided systems, including 3D scanners, present numerous advantages and the recent Artec Eva scanner, based on laser free technology, could potentially be an effective solution for monitoring residual limb volumes.The aim of this study was to assess the validity and reliability of the Artec Eva scanner (practical measurement) against a high precision laser 3D scanner (criterion measurement) for the determination of residual limb model shape and volume.Three observers completed three repeat assessments of ten residual limb models, using both the scanners. Validity of the Artec Eva scanner was assessed (mean percentage error <2%) and Bland-Altman statistics were adopted to assess the agreement between the two scanners. Intra and inter-rater reliability (repeatability coefficient <5%) of the Artec Eva scanner was calculated for measuring indices of residual limb model volume and shape (i.e. residual limb cross sectional areas and perimeters).Residual limb model volumes ranged from 885 to 4399 ml. Mean percentage error of the Artec Eva scanner (validity) was 1.4% of the criterion volumes. Correlation coefficients between the Artec Eva and the Romer determined variables were higher than 0.9. Volume intra-rater and inter-rater reliability coefficients were 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Shape percentage maximal error was 2% at the distal end of the residual limb, with intra-rater reliability coefficients presenting the lowest errors (0.2%), both for cross sectional areas and perimeters of the residual limb models.The Artec Eva scanner is a valid and reliable method for assessing residual limb model shapes and volumes. While the method needs to be tested on human residual limbs and the results compared with the current system used in clinical practice, it has the potential to quantify shape and volume fluctuations with greater resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2750792125,"The present study describes the behavior of a natural phenanthrene-degrading consortium (CON), a synthetic consortium (constructed with isolated strains from CON) and an isolated strain form CON (Sphingobium sp. AM) in phenanthrene cultures to understand the interactions among the microorganisms present in the natural consortium during phenanthrene degradation as a sole carbon and energy source in liquid cultures. In the contaminant degradation assay, the defined consortium not only achieved a major phenanthrene degradation percentage (> 95%) but also showed a more efficient elimination of the intermediate metabolite. The opposite behavior occurred in the CON culture where the lowest phenanthrene degradation and the highest HNA accumulation were observed, which suggests the presence of positive and also negative interaction in CON. To consider the uncultured bacteria present in CON, a metagenomic library was constructed with total CON DNA. One of the resulting scaffolds (S1P3) was affiliated with the Betaproteobacteria class and resulted in a significant similarity with a genome fragment from Burkholderia sp. HB1 chromosome 1. A complete gene cluster, which is related to one of the lower pathways (meta-cleavage of catechol) involved in PAH degradation (ORF 31–43), mobile genetic elements and associated proteins, was found. These results suggest the presence of at least one other microorganism in CON besides Sphingobium sp. AM, which is capable of degrading PAH through the meta-cleavage pathway. Burkholderiales order was further found, along with Sphingomonadales order, by a metaproteomic approach, which indicated that both orders were metabolically active in CON. Our results show the presence of negative interactions between bacterial populations found in a natural consortium selected by enrichment techniques; moreover, the synthetic syntrophic processing chain with only one microorganism with the capability of degrading phenanthrene was more efficient in contaminant and intermediate metabolite degradation than a generalist strain (Sphingobium sp. AM)."
https://openalex.org/W2753048064,"Homing of peripheral stem cells is regulated by one of the most representative homing factors, stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha (SDF-1α), which specifically binds to the plasma membrane receptor CXCR4 of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in order to initiate the signaling pathways that lead to directional migration and homing of stem cells. This complex homing process and directional migration of stem cells have been mimicked on a microfluidic device that is capable of generating a chemokine gradient within the collagen matrix and embedding endothelial cell (EC) monolayers to mimic blood vessels. On the microfluidic device, stem cells showed directional migration toward the higher concentration of SDF-1α, whereas treatment with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 caused loss of directionality of stem cells. Furthermore, inhibition of stem cell’s main migratory signaling pathways, Rho-ROCK and Rac pathways, caused blockage of actomyosin and lamellipodia formation, decreasing the migration distance but maintaining directionality. Stem cell homing regulated by SDF-1α caused directional migration of stem cells, while the migratory ability was affected by the activation of migration-related signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2752217967,"Purpose To characterize corneal structural changes in keratoconus using a new morphogeometric approach and to evaluate its potential diagnostic ability. Methods Comparative study including 464 eyes of 464 patients (age, 16 and 72 years) divided into two groups: control group (143 healthy eyes) and keratoconus group (321 keratoconus eyes). Topographic information (Sirius, CSO, Italy) was processed with SolidWorks v2012 and a solid model representing the geometry of each cornea was generated. The following parameters were defined: anterior (Aant) and posterior (Apost) corneal surface areas, area of the cornea within the sagittal plane passing through the Z axis and the apex (Aapexant, Aapexpost) and minimum thickness points (Amctant, Amctpost) of the anterior and posterior corneal surfaces, and average distance from the Z axis to the apex (Dapexant, Dapexpost) and minimum thickness points (Dmctant, Dmctpost) of both corneal surfaces. Results Significant differences among control and keratoconus group were found in Aapexant, Aapexpost, Amctant, Amctpost, Dapexant, Dapexpost (all p<0.001), Apost (p = 0.014), and Dmctpost (p = 0.035). Significant correlations in keratoconus group were found between Aant and Apost (r = 0.836), Amctant and Amctpost (r = 0.983), and Dmctant and Dmctpost (r = 0.954, all p<0.001). A logistic regression analysis revealed that the detection of keratoconus grade I (Amsler Krumeich) was related to Apost, Atot, Aapexant, Amctant, Amctpost, Dapexpost, Dmctant and Dmctpost (Hosmer-Lemeshow: p>0.05, R2 Nagelkerke: 0.926). The overall percentage of cases correctly classified by the model was 97.30%. Conclusions Our morphogeometric approach based on the analysis of the cornea as a solid is useful for the characterization and detection of keratoconus."
https://openalex.org/W2751501769,"In Australia, almost half of HIV-positive people are now aged over 50 and are predominately gay and bisexual men (GBM). Compared to the general HIV-negative population, GBM engage more in behaviours that may increase the risk of age-related comorbidities, including smoking, high alcohol consumption and recreational drug use. The objective of APPLES was to compare comorbidities and risk factors in HIV-positive older GBM with an appropriate control group of HIV-negative GBM. We undertook a prospectively recruited cross-sectional sample of HIV-positive and HIV-negative GBM ≥ 55 years. Detailed data collection included clinic data, a health and lifestyle survey, and blood sample collection. We report key demographic, laboratory markers and self-reported comorbidities by HIV status. For selected comorbidities we also adjust HIV status a priori for age, smoking and body mass index. Over 16 months 228 HIV-positive and 218 HIV-negative men were recruited. Median age was 63 years (IQR: 59-67). Although more HIV-positive men reported having ever smoked, smoking status was not statistically different between HIV positive and HIV negative men (p = 0.081). Greater alcohol use was reported by HIV-negative men (p = 0.002), and recreational drug use reported more often by HIV-positive men (p<0.001). After adjustment, HIV-positive men had significantly increased odds of diabetes (adjusted Odds ratio (aOR): 1.97, p = 0.038), thrombosis (aOR: 3.08, p = 0.007), neuropathy (aOR: 34.6, P<0.001), and non-significantly increased odds for heart-disease (aOR: 1.71, p = 0.077). In conclusion, HIV-positive GBM have significantly increased odds for key self-reported comorbidities. This study underscores the importance of an appropriate HIV-negative control group for more accurate evaluation of the risk and attribution of age-related comorbidities in HIV-positive people."
https://openalex.org/W2752538304,"Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity limits its use in many cancer patients. The expression of enzymes involved in polyamine catabolism, spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) and spermine oxidase (SMOX) increase in the kidneys of mice treated with cisplatin. We hypothesized that enhanced polyamine catabolism contributes to tissue damage in cisplatin acute kidney injury (AKI). Using gene knockout and chemical inhibitors, the role of polyamine catabolism in cisplatin AKI was examined. Deficiency of SSAT, SMOX or neutralization of the toxic products of polyamine degradation, H2O2 and aminopropanal, significantly diminished the severity of cisplatin AKI. In vitro studies demonstrated that the induction of SSAT and elevated polyamine catabolism in cells increases the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and enhances the expression of binding immunoglobulin protein BiP/GRP78) and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP/GADD153). The increased expression of these endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ERSR) markers was accompanied by the activation of caspase-3. These results suggest that enhanced polyamine degradation in cisplatin AKI may lead to tubular damage through the induction of ERSR and the consequent onset of apoptosis. In support of the above, we show that the ablation of the SSAT or SMOX gene, as well as the neutralization of polyamine catabolism products modulate the onset of ERSR (e.g. lower BiP and CHOP) and apoptosis (e.g. reduced activated caspase-3). These studies indicate that enhanced polyamine catabolism and its toxic products are important mediators of ERSR and critical to the pathogenesis of cisplatin AKI."
https://openalex.org/W2753608897,"Background and aims Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥6.5% (or 48mmol/mol) has been recommended as a new diagnostic criterion for diabetes; however, limited literature is available regarding the effect of age on the HbA1c for diagnosing diabetes and the causes for this age effect remain unknown. In this study, we investigated whether and why age affects the diagnostic efficiency of HbA1c for diabetes in a community-based Chinese population. Methods In total, 4325 participants without previously known diabetes were enrolled in this study. Participants were stratified by age. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was plotted for each age group and the area under the curve (AUC) represented the diagnostic efficiency of HbA1c for diabetes defined by the plasma glucose criteria. The area under the ROC curve in each one-year age group was defined as AUCage. Multiple regression analyses were performed to identify factors inducing the association between age and AUCage based on the changes in the β and P values of age. Results The current threshold of HbA1c (≥6.5% or 48mmol/mol) showed low sensitivity (35.6%) and high specificity (98.9%) in diagnosing diabetes. ROC curve analyses showed that the diagnostic efficiency of HbA1c in the ≥75 years age group was significantly lower than that in the 45–54 years age group (AUC: 0.755 vs. 0.878; P<0.001). Pearson correlation analysis showed that the AUCage of HbA1c was negatively correlated with age (r = -0.557, P = 0.001). When adjusting the red blood cell (RBC) count in the multiple regression model, the negative association between age and AUCage disappeared, with the regression coefficient of age reversed to 0.001 and the P value increased to 0.856. Conclusions The diagnostic efficiency of HbA1c for diabetes decreased with aging, and this age effect was induced by the decreasing RBC count with age. HbA1c is unsuitable for diagnosing diabetes in elderly individuals because of their physiologically decreased RBC count."
https://openalex.org/W2751505658,"Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread zoonotic parasite that is relevant for veterinary and public health. The domestic cat, the definitive host species with the largest worldwide population, has become evolutionarily and epidemiologically the most important host of T. gondii. The outcome of T. gondii infection is influenced by congenital and acquired host characteristics. We detected differences in T. gondii seroprevalence by cat breed in our previous studies. The aims of this study were to estimate T. gondii seroprevalence in selected domestic cat breeds, and to evaluate whether being of a certain breed is associated with T. gondii seropositivity, when the age and lifestyle of the cat are taken into account. The studied breeds were the Birman, British Shorthair, Burmese, Korat, Norwegian Forest Cat, Ocicat, Persian, and Siamese. Plasma samples were analyzed for the presence of immunoglobulin G antibodies against T. gondii with a commercial direct agglutination test at dilution 1:40. The samples were accompanied by owner-completed questionnaires that provided background data on the cats. Overall, 41.12% of the 1121 cats tested seropositive, and the seroprevalence increased with age. The Burmese had the lowest seroprevalence (18.82%) and the Persian had the highest (60.00%). According to the final multivariable logistic regression model, the odds to test seropositive were four to seven times higher in Birmans, Ocicats, Norwegian Forest Cats, and Persians when compared with the Burmese, while older age and receiving raw meat were also risk factors for T. gondii seropositivity. This study showed that T. gondii seroprevalence varies by cat breed and identified being of certain breeds, older age, and receiving raw meat as risk factors for seropositivity."
https://openalex.org/W2752719940,"Viroids, the smallest known pathogens, unable to encode any proteins, can cause severe diseases in their host plants. One of the proposed mechanisms of their pathogenicity includes silencing the host’s genes via viroid-derived small RNAs, which are products of the host’s immune response to the viroid’s double stranded RNA. Humulus lupulus (hop) plants are hosts to several viroids; two of them, HLVd and CBCVd, are interesting models for studying host-viroid interactions, due to the symptomless infection of the former and severe stunting disease caused by the latter. To study these interactions, we constructed a deep hop NGS transcriptome based on 35 Gb paired-end sequencing data assembled into over 74 Mb of contigs. These transcripts were used for in-silico prediction of target transcripts of vd-sRNA of the two aforementioned viroids, using two different software tools. Prediction models revealed that 1062 and 1387 hop transcripts share nucleotide similarities with HLVd- and CBCVd-derived small RNAs, respectively, so they could be silenced in an RNA interference process. Furthermore, we selected 17 transcripts from 4 groups of targets involved in the metabolism of plant hormones, small RNA biogenesis, transcripts with high complementarity with viroid-derived small RNAs and transcripts targeted by CBCVd-derived small RNAs with high cellular concentrations. Their expression was monitored by reverse transcription quantitative PCR performed using leaf, flower and cone samples. Additionally, the expression of 5 pathogenesis related genes was monitored. Expression analysis confirmed high expression levels of four pathogenesis related genes in leaves of HLVd and CBCVd infected hop plants. Expression fluctuations were observed for the majority of targets, with possible evidence of downregulation of GATA transcription factor by CBCVd- and of linoleate 13S-lipoxygenase by HLVd-derived small RNAs. These results provide a deep transcriptome of hop and the first insights into complex viroid-hop plant interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2752400254,"Material wealth is a key factor shaping human development and well-being. Every year, hundreds of studies in social science and policy fields assess material wealth in low- and middle-income countries assuming that there is a single dimension by which households can move from poverty to prosperity. However, a one-dimensional model may miss important kinds of prosperity, particularly in countries where traditional subsistence-based livelihoods coexist with modern cash economies. Using multiple correspondence analysis to analyze representative household data from six countries—Nepal, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Guatemala—across three world regions, we identify a number of independent dimension of wealth, each with a clear link to locally relevant pathways to success in cash and agricultural economies. In all cases, the first dimension identified by this approach replicates standard one-dimensional estimates and captures success in cash economies. The novel dimensions we identify reflect success in different agricultural sectors and are independently associated with key benchmarks of food security and human growth, such as adult body mass index and child height. The multidimensional models of wealth we describe here provide new opportunities for examining the causes and consequences of wealth inequality that go beyond success in cash economies, for tracing the emergence of hybrid pathways to prosperity, and for assessing how these different pathways to economic success carry different health risks and social opportunities."

In this study, we aimed to determine the mother-to-child transmission rate in a programmatic setting and to determine factors associated with LTFU among enrolled mothers and unfavorable outcomes among HIV-exposed babies which includes being HIV positive, death and LTFU.A retrospective cohort study reviewing routinely collected data in an Integrated HIV care program, Mandalay, Myanmar in June 2016.LTFU means mother/infant missing appointed visit for more than three months.Of 678 pregnant women enrolled in PMTCT program between March 2011 and June 2014, one stillbirth and 607 live births were recorded in this cohort. Of 457 HIV-exposed babies with HIV-test recorded at the end of the intervention, nine (2%) were HIV-positive. Pregnant women's and exposed-babies' LTFU rate was 7 per 1000 person-years, and 10 per 1000 person-years respectively. PMTCT option B protocol was found to be significantly associate with maternal LTFU [adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR) 95% CI: 3.52 (1.38-8.96)] when compare to mothers receiving option B+/lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART). Weight <2.5 Kg at enrolment, receiving mixed-feeding, vaginal delivery and option B PMTCT protocol were significantly associated with unfavorable outcomes among exposed babies [aHR(95% CI): 5.40 (1.66-17.53), 5.91(1.68-20.84), 2.27 (1.22-4.22) and 2.33 (1.16-4.69) respectively].Mother-to-child HIV transmission rate in this public hospital-based program was lower than the 5% national target, which indicates a successful PMTCT intervention. However, a high proportion of HIV-infected mothers and exposed babies LTFU was recorded. Lifelong ART provision to HIV-positive pregnant women was shown to reduce exposed babies' LTFU, death and transmission rate (unfavorable outcomes) in this setting. Lessons learned from this program could be used to inform policy and practice in the country, while the programmatic challenge of LTFU should be urgently addressed."
https://openalex.org/W2753327870,"Introduction Police officers frequently come into contact with individuals with mental health problems. Specialist training in this area for police officers may improve how they respond to individuals with mental health problems; however, evidence to support this is sparse. This study evaluated the effectiveness of one bespoke mental health training package for frontline police officers relative to routine training. Design Pragmatic, two-armed cluster randomised controlled trial in one police force in England. Police stations in North Yorkshire were randomised with frontline police officers receiving either a bespoke mental health training package or routine training. The primary outcome was the number of incidents which resulted in a police response reported to the North Yorkshire Police control room up to six months after delivery of training. Secondary outcomes included: likelihood of incidents using Section 136 of the Mental Health Act; likelihood of incidents having a mental health tag applied; and number of individuals with a mental health warning marker involved in incidents. The appropriateness of mental health tags applied to a random sample of incidents was checked by an independent mental health professional. Routinely collected data were used. Results Twelve police stations were recruited and randomised (Intervention group n = 6; Control group n = 6), and 249 officers received the bespoke mental health training intervention. At follow-up, a median of 397 incidents were assigned to trial stations in the intervention group, and 498 in the control group. There was no evidence of a difference in the number of incidents with a police response (adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.38, p = 0.69), or in the number of people with mental health warning markers involved in incidents (adjusted IRR 1.39, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.10, p = 0.13) between the intervention and control groups up to six months following the intervention; however, incidents assigned to stations in the intervention group were more likely to have a mental health tag applied to them than incidents assigned to control stations (adjusted odds ratio 1.41, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.71, p = 0.001). The review of 100 incidents suggests that there may be incidents involving individuals with mental health issues that are not being recorded as such (Kappa coefficient 0.65). There was no statistically significant difference in the likelihood of Section 136 of the Mental Health Act being applied to an incident. Conclusions The bespoke one day mental health training delivered to frontline officers by mental health professionals did not reduce the number of incidents reported to the police control room up to six months after its delivery; however training may have a positive effect on how the police record incidents involving individuals with mental health problems. Our trial has shown that conducting pragmatic trials within the police setting is feasible and acceptable. There is a wealth of routinely collected police data that can be utilised for research and further collaboration between police forces and academia is encouraged.

We elucidated the prevalence, seasonality, type distribution and clinical presentation of HPeV among children in Hong Kong.A 24-month prospective study to detect HPeV in children ≤36 months hospitalized for acute viral illnesses.2.3% of the 3911 children examined had HPeV infection, with most (87.5%) concentrated in September-January (autumn-winter). 81.3% were HPeV1 and 12.5% were HPeV4, while HPeV3 was rare (2.5%). HPeV was a probable cause of the disease in 47.7% (42/88), mostly self-limiting including acute gastroenteritis, upper respiratory tract infection and maculopapular rash. A neonate developed severe sepsis-like illness with HPeV3 as the only pathogen detected. A high proportion (60.0%) of children coinfected with HPeV and other respiratory virus(es) had acute bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Six children with HPeV coinfections developed convulsion / pallid attack. Most rash illnesses exhibited a generalized maculopapular pattern involving the trunk and limbs, and were more likely associated with HPeV4 compared to other syndrome groups (36.4% vs. 3.1%, p = 0.011).In Hong Kong, HPeV exhibits a clear seasonality (autumn-winter) and was found in a small proportion (2.3%) of young children (≤36 months) admitted with features of acute viral illnesses. The clinical presentation ranged from mild gastroenteritis, upper respiratory tract infection and febrile rash to convulsion and severe sepsis-like illness. HPeV3, which is reported to associate with more severe disease in neonates, is rare in Hong Kong. HPeV coinfection might associate with convulsion and aggravate other respiratory tract infections."

We therefore analyzed microbiome diversity in saliva samples from 92 volunteers from eight different sampling locations in India by amplifying and sequencing variable regions (V1 and V2) of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The results showed immense bacterial richness in Indian populations; we identified 165 bacterial genera and 785 unique Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), with substantial sharing among the populations. There were small, but significant correlations in the abundance of bacterial genera in sampling locations from the same geographic region. Most of the core OTUs detected were also observed previously in other populations, but Solobacterium spp., Lachnoanaerobaculum spp. and Alloprevotella spp. were observed to be a component of the saliva microbiome unique to Indian populations. Importantly, nine bacterial genera were observed that were not listed in the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD). These results highlight the importance of analyzing underrepresented populations like those of India."
https://openalex.org/W2751310107,"Industrial longline fisheries cause the death of large numbers of seabirds annually. Various mitigation measures have been proposed, including the use of tori lines. In this study the efficiency of a single tori line to reduce seabird bycatch was tested on pelagic longline vessels (25-37m length). Thirteen fishing trips were carried out in the area and season of the highest bycatch rates recorded in the southwest Atlantic (2009–2011). We deployed two treatments in random order: sets with a tori line and without a tori line (control treatment). The use of a tori line significantly reduced seabird bycatch rates. Forty three and seven birds were captured in the control (0.85 birds/1,000 hooks, n = 49 sets) and in the tori line treatment (0.13 birds/1,000 hooks, n = 51 sets), respectively. In 47% of the latter sets the tori line broke either because of entanglement with the longline gear or by tension. This diminished the tori line effectiveness; five of the seven captures during sets where a tori line was deployed were following ruptures. Nine additional trips were conducted with a tori line that was modified to reduce entanglements (2012–2016). Seven entanglements were recorded in 73 longline sets. The chance of a rupture on these trips was 4% (95% c.l. = 1–18%) of that during 2009–2011. This work shows that the use of a tori line reduces seabird bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries and is a practice suitable for medium size vessels (~25-40m length). Because the study area has historically very high bycatch rates at global level, this tori line design is potentially useful to reduce seabird bycatch in many medium size pelagic longline vessel fishing in the southern hemisphere."

Among these changes, the nuclear fragmentation and condensation have been regarded as the important markers but quantitative characterization of these changes is yet to be achieved. We have acquired confocal image stacks of 206 viable and apoptotic MCF-7 cells stained by three fluorescent dyes. Three-dimensional (3D) parameters were extracted to quantify and compare their differences in morphology. To analyze nuclear fragmentation, a new method has been developed to determine clustering of nuclear voxels in the reconstructed cells due to fluorescence intensity changes in nuclei of apoptotic cells. The results of these studies reveal that the 3D morphological changes in cytoplasm and nuclear membranes in apoptotic cells provide sensitive targets for label-free detection and staging of apoptosis. Furthermore, the clustering analysis and morphological data on nuclear fragmentation are highly useful for derivation of optical cell models and simulation of diffraction images to investigate light scattering by early apoptotic cells, which can lead to future development of label-free and rapid methods of apoptosis assay based on cell morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2752408900,"Spatial erosion of stock structure through local overfishing can lead to stock collapse because fish often prefer certain locations, and fisheries tend to focus on those locations. Fishery managers are challenged to maintain the integrity of the entire stock and require scientific approaches that provide them with sound advice. Here we propose a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal modelling framework for fish abundance data to estimate key parameters that define spatial stock structure: persistence (similarity of spatial structure over time), connectivity (coherence of temporal pattern over space), and spatial variance (variation across the seascape). The consideration of these spatial parameters in the stock assessment process can help identify the erosion of structure and assist in preventing local overfishing. We use Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in eastern Canada as a case study an examine the behaviour of these parameters from the height of the fishery through its collapse. We identify clear signals in parameter behaviour under circumstances of destructive stock erosion as well as for recovery of spatial structure even when combined with a non-recovery in abundance. Further, our model reveals the spatial pattern of areas of high and low density persists over the 41 years of available data and identifies the remnant patches. Models of this sort are crucial to recovery plans if we are to identify and protect remaining sources of recolonization for Atlantic cod. Our method is immediately applicable to other exploited species."

The causal agent of IHN is the IHN virus (IHNV) introduced from overseas. However, until today, its phylogeographic spread in Europe remains poorly understood. We therefore sought to elucidate this unresolved topic by using the largest ever compiled dataset of European IHNV isolates (E isolates) (193 GenBank E isolates and 100 isolates from this study) for the complete glycoprotein (G) gene sequence. Our results clearly revealed that the active trout trade has left its traces in the E phylogeny. For example, the spread by trade of IHNV-infected trout was apparently the cause for the exposure of the E lineage to different local scenarios of selection and genetic drift, and therefore has led to the split of this lineage into various subordinated lineages. Accordingly, we also found evidence for E isolates being mixed Europe-wide by cross-border introduction events. Moreover, there were indications that this propagation of the E lineage within Europe corresponded with an extensive and rapid spread event, already during or shortly after its formation. Finally, in accordance with the high substitution rate of IHNV determined by previous studies, our dataset indicates that the mean period of occurrence of a single E haplotype is typically not longer than one calendar year."
https://openalex.org/W2752153219,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) has lately become a suitable scenario to study the interplay between the hematopoietic system and disease progression. Recent studies in C9orf72 null mice have demonstrated that C9orf72 is necessary for the normal function of myeloid cells. In this study, we aimed to analyze in depth the connection between the hematopoietic system and secondary lymphoid (spleen) and non-lymphoid (liver and skeletal muscle) organs and tissues along the disease progression in the transgenic SOD1G93A mice. Our findings suggested that the inflammatory response due to the neurodegeneration in this animal model affected all three organs and tissues, especially the liver and the skeletal muscle. However, the liver was able to compensate this inflammatory response by means of the action of non-inflammatory monocytes, while in the skeletal muscle inflammatory monocytes prompted a further inflammation process until the terminal state of the animals. Interestingly, in blood, a positive correlation was found between non-inflammatory monocytes and survival of the transgenic SOD1G93A mice, while the contrary (a negative correlation) was found in the case of inflammatory monocytes, supporting their potential role as biomarkers of disease progression and survival in this animal model. These findings could prompt future translational studies in ALS patients, promoting the identification of new reliable biomarkers of disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2752625692,"Background Reference interval is crucial for disease screening, diagnosis, monitoring, progression and treatment efficacy. Due to lack of locally derived reference values for the parameters, clinicians use reference intervals derived from western population. But, studies conducted in different African countries have indicated differences between locally and western derived reference values. Different studies also indicated considerable variation in clinical chemistry reference intervals by several variables such as age, sex, geographical location, environment, lifestyle and genetic variation. Objective This study aimed to determine the reference intervals of common clinical chemistry parameters of the community of Gojjam Zones, Northwest Ethiopia. Method Population based cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2015 to December 2016 in healthy adult populations of Gojjam zone. Data such as, medical history, physical examination and socio-demographic data were collected. In addition, laboratory investigations were undertaken to screen the population. Clinical chemistry parameters were measured using Mindray BS 200 clinical chemistry autoanalyzer as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Descriptive statistics was used to calculate mean, median and 95th percentiles. Independent sample T-test and one way ANOVA were used to see association between variables. Results After careful screening of a total of 799 apparently healthy adults who were consented for this study, complete data from 446 (224 females and 222 males) were included for the analysis. The mean age of both the study participants was 28.8 years. Males had high (P<0.05) mean and 2.5th-97.5th percentile ranges of ALT, AST, ALP, creatinine and direct bilirubin. The reference intervals of amylase, LDH, total protein and total bilirubin were not significantly different between the two sex groups (P>0.05). Mean, median, 95% percentile values of AST, ALP, amylase, LDH, creatinine, total protein, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin across all age groups of participants were similar (P>0.05). But, there was a significant difference in the value of ALT (P<0.05). The reference intervals of ALT, total protein and creatinine were significantly (P<0.05) high in people having monthly income >1500 ETB compared to those with low monthly income. Significant (P<0.05) higher values of the ALT, ALP and total protein were observed in people living in high land compared to low land residences. Conclusion The study showed that some of the common clinical chemistry parameters reference intervals of healthy adults in Gojjam zones were higher than the reference intervals generated from developed countries. Therefore, strict adherence to the reference values generated in developed countries could lead to inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of patients. There was also variation of reference interval values based on climate, gender, age, monthly income and geographical locations. Therefore, further study is required to establish reference intervals for Ethiopian population."

https://openalex.org/W2753539038,"Agropyron elongatum (Host.) Neviski (synonym, Thinopyrum ponticum Podp., 2n = 70) has been used extensively as a valuable source for wheat breeding. Numerous chromosome fragments containing valuable genes have been successfully translocated into wheat from A. elongatum. However, reports on the transfer of powdery mildew resistance from A. elongatum to wheat are rare. In this study, a novel wheat-A. elongatum translocation line, 11-20-1, developed and selected from the progenies of a sequential cross between wheat varieties (Lankaoaizaoba, Keyu 818 and BainongAK 58) and A. elongatum, was evaluated for disease resistance and characterized using molecular cytogenetic methods. Cytological observations indicated that 11-20-1 had 42 chromosomes and formed 21 bivalents at meiotic metaphase I. Genomic in situ hybridization analysis using whole genomic DNA from A. elongatum as a probe showed that the short arms of a pair of wheat chromosomes were replaced by a pair of A. elongatum chromosome arms. Fluorescence in situ hybridization, using wheat D chromosome specific sequence pAs1 as a probe, suggested that the replaced chromosome arms of 11-20-1 were 5DS. This was further confirmed by wheat SSR markers specific for 5DS. EST-SSR and EST-STS multiple loci markers confirmed that the introduced A. elongatum chromosome arms belonged to homoeologous group 5. Therefore, it was deduced that 11-20-1 was a wheat-A. elongatum T5DL∙5AgS translocation line. Both resistance observation and molecular marker analyses using two specific markers (BE443538 and CD452608) of A. elongatum in a F2 population from a cross between line 11-20-1 and a susceptible cultivar Yannong 19 verified that the A. elongatum chromosomes were responsible for the powdery mildew resistance. This work suggests that 11-20-1 likely contains a novel resistance gene against powdery mildew. We expect this line to be useful for the genetic improvement of wheat."
https://openalex.org/W2751377605,"The economic production of cellulosic biofuel requires efficient and full utilization of all abundant carbohydrates naturally released from plant biomass by enzyme cocktails. Recently, we reconstituted the Neurospora crassa xylodextrin transport and consumption system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, enabling growth of yeast on xylodextrins aerobically. However, the consumption rate of xylodextrin requires improvement for industrial applications, including consumption in anaerobic conditions. As a first step in this improvement, we report analysis of orthologues of the N. crassa transporters CDT-1 and CDT-2. Transporter ST16 from Trichoderma virens enables faster aerobic growth of S. cerevisiae on xylodextrins compared to CDT-2. ST16 is a xylodextrin-specific transporter, and the xylobiose transport activity of ST16 is not inhibited by cellobiose. Other transporters identified in the screen also enable growth on xylodextrins including xylotriose. Taken together, these results indicate that multiple transporters might prove useful to improve xylodextrin utilization in S. cerevisiae. Efforts to use directed evolution to improve ST16 from a chromosomally-integrated copy were not successful, due to background growth of yeast on other carbon sources present in the selection medium. Future experiments will require increasing the baseline growth rate of the yeast population on xylodextrins, to ensure that the selective pressure exerted on xylodextrin transport can lead to isolation of improved xylodextrin transporters."
https://openalex.org/W2752257387,"Radiation is an important therapy for cancer with many benefits; however, its side effects, such as impaired wound healing, are a major problem. While many attempts have been made to overcome this particular disadvantage, there are few effective treatments for impaired wound healing in an X-ray-irradiated field. One reason for this deficiency is the lack of experimental models, especially animal models. We have previously reported a mouse model of impaired wound healing in which the irradiation area was restricted to the hindlimbs. In this mouse model, due to the size of the animal, a diameter of five millimeters was considered the largest wound size suitable for the model. In addition, the transplanted cells had to be harvested from other inbred animals. To investigate larger wounds and the impact of autologous specimen delivery, a rabbit model was developed. Rabbits were kept in a special apparatus to shield the body and hindlimbs while the irradiation field was exposed to radiation. Six weeks after irradiation, a 2 x 2 cm, full-thickness skin defect was made inside the irradiation field. Then, the wound area was observed over time. The wound area after irradiation was larger than that without irradiation at all time points. Both angiogenesis and collagen formation were reduced. For further study, as an example of using this model, the effect of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was observed. Autologous PRP from peripheral blood (pb-PRP) and bone marrow aspirate (bm-PRP) was processed and injected into the wounds in the irradiated field. Two weeks later, the wounds treated with bm-PRP were significantly smaller than those treated with phosphate buffer vehicle controls. In contrast, the wounds treated with pb-PRP were not significantly different from the controls. This rabbit model is useful for investigating the mechanism of impaired wound healing in an X-ray-irradiated field."
https://openalex.org/W2752888280,"TNF is a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by both lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells. As a consequence of the widespread expression of its receptors (TNFR1 and 2), TNF plays a role in many important biological processes. In the context of influenza A virus (IAV) infection, TNF has variably been implicated in mediating immunopathology as well as suppression of the immune response. Although a number of cell types are able to produce TNF, the ability of CD8+ T cells to produce TNF following viral infection is a hallmark of their effector function. As such, the regulation and role of CD8+ T cell-derived TNF following viral infection is of great interest. Here, we show that the biphasic production of TNF by CD8+ T cells following in vitro stimulation corresponds to distinct patterns of epigenetic modifications. Further, we show that a global loss of TNF during IAV infection results in an augmentation of the peripheral virus-specific CD8+ T cell response. Subsequent adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated that this attenuation of the CD8+ T cell response was largely, but not exclusively, conferred by extrinsic TNF, with intrinsically-derived TNF making only modest contributions. In conclusion, TNF exerts an immunoregulatory role on CD8+ T cell responses following IAV infection, an effect that is largely mediated by extrinsically-derived TNF."
https://openalex.org/W2752994696,"Little is known about the epidemiology of interstitial lung disease (ILD) amongst Canada's Indigenous populations. Clinicians working in Eeyou Istchee (the Cree territory of the James Bay region of Québec, population 17, 956) suspected that ILD was more common in this area. We sought to identify all prevalent and incident cases of ILD in Eeyou Istchee between 2006 and 2013, to describe characteristics of affected patients, distribution of subtypes, and estimate disease incidence.Potential ILD cases amongst Eeyou Istchee residents were identified by searching hospitalization databases and lists of patients on long term home oxygen in the region's nine communities, and surveying physicians and nurses. Clinical, radiological and pathological data were reviewed. Potential cases were classified as 'Definite ILD' if an open lung biopsy demonstrated ILD or, in the absence of histopathologic confirmation, if their thoracic CT imaging was deemed consistent with ILD by a panel of two respirologists and a chest radiologist. Potential cases for whom CT images could not be retrieved for our review were not eligible for classification as Definite ILD, unless they had undergone open lung biopsy. The Definite ILD group was further categorized by subtype of ILD. For usual interstitial pneumonia and non-specific interstitial pneumonitis patterns, we assumed cases were idiopathic in the absence of documentation of connective tissue disease or occupational exposures in the medical chart. For Definite ILD and the most common subtype, we calculated the average annual incidence rates, age-standardized to the province of Quebec, for 2006 to 2013, using a gamma distribution to calculate 95% confidence intervals.Of 167 potential cases, 52 were categorized as Definite ILD: 14 on the basis of histopathology and 38 on the basis of CT imaging alone. Six patients had a prior history of connective tissue disease. Information on occupation was recorded in the charts of 18/52 (35%) cases, and missing in the remainder. We found the most common subtype was idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (27/52, 52%), followed by idiopathic non-specific interstitial pneumonia (13/52, 25%), and secondary usual interstitial pneumonia associated with connective tissue diseases (5/52, 10%). The age-standardized annual incidence between 2006-2013 was 80 per 100,000 person-years observed (PYO) for ILD, and 46 per 100,000 PYO for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.The incidence of ILD and of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in Eeyou Istchee may be higher than rates reported in other populations; however, cautious interpretation is required due to the lack of histopathological confirmation in the majority of cases, and our reliance on chart review to exclude secondary causes. A prospective study of incident cases with standardized assessments to establish the types of ILD and to assess for potential causes could overcome some of the limitations of the present analysis. Studies evaluating ILD incidence and subtype distribution in other Indigenous populations would also be of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2753394018,"A recent paper in Neurology used statistical techniques to investigate the integrity of the randomization in 33 clinical trials conducted by a group of investigators. Without justification, the approach assumed that there would be no impact of correlation among baseline variables. We investigated the impact of correlation on the conclusions of the approach in several large-scale simulation studies that replicated the sample sizes and baseline variables of the clinical trials in question and utilized proper randomization. Additionally, we considered scenarios with larger numbers of baseline variables. We found that, with even moderate correlation, there can be substantial inflation of the type I error of statistical tests of randomization integrity. This is also the case under no correlation, in the presence of some discrete baseline variables, with a large number of variables. Thus, statistical techniques for assessing randomization integrity should be applied with extreme caution given that very low p-values, which are taken as evidence against valid randomization, can arise even in the case of valid randomization, in the presence of correlation. More generally, the use of tests of goodness of fit to uniformity for the purpose of testing a global null hypothesis is not advisable in the presence of correlation."
https://openalex.org/W2751664563,"Background Homoarginine (hArg) has been shown to be of prognostic value in patients with chronic left heart failure. The present study aims to assess the clinical utility and prognostic value of hArg levels in patients with complex congenital heart disease (CHD). Methods Plasma hArg levels were measured in 143 patients with complex CHD and compared to clinical status, echocardiographic and laboratory parameters as well as the occurrence of adverse cardiac events. Results Median hArg levels were 1.5 μmol/l in CHD patients as compared to 1.70 μmol/l in healthy controls (p = 0.051). Median hArg levels were lowest in patients with Fontan palliation (1.27 μmol/l) and Eisenmenger physiology (0.99 μmol/l) and decreased with the severity of adverse cardiac events with lowest values found in patients prior to death or overt heart failure (0.89 μmol/l). According to ROC analysis, the most important predictors of adverse cardiac events were hArg levels (AUC 0.837, p<0.001, CI 0.726–0.947), NYHA class (AUC 0.800, p<0.001, CI 0.672–0.928) and NT-proBNP levels (AUC 0.780, p<0.001, CI 0.669–0.891). The occurrence of overt heart failure or death due to progressive heart failure were best predicted by NYHA class (AUC 0.945, p<0.001, CI 0.898–0.992), hArg levels (AUC 0.911, p<0.001, CI 0.850–0.971) and NT-proBNP levels (AUC 0.877, p<0.001, CI 0.791–0.962), respectively. Conclusion In patients with complex CHD, hArg levels can predict adverse cardiac events as reliably as or even better than NT-proBNP levels and thus might be of prognostic value in this subset of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2752187395,"Although there are a number of online platforms for patient-level clinical trial data sharing from industry sponsors, they are not very harmonized regarding the role of local ethics approval in the research proposal review process. The first and largest of these platforms is ClinicalStudyDataRequest.com (CSDR), which includes over three thousand trials from thirteen sponsors including GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Roche, Sanofi, and Bayer. CSDR asks applicants to state whether they have received ethics approval for their research proposal, but in most cases does not require that they submit evidence of approval. However, the website does require that applicants without ethical approval state the reason it was not required. In order to examine the perspectives of researchers on this topic, we coded every response to that question received by CSDR between June 2014 and February 2017. Of 111 applicants who stated they were exempt from ethics approval, 63% mentioned de-identification, 57% mentioned the use of existing data, 33% referred to local or jurisdictional regulations, and 20% referred to the approvals obtained by the original study. We conclude by examining the experience of CSDR within the broader context of the access mechanisms and policies currently being used by other data sharing platforms, and discuss how our findings might be used to help clinical trial data providers design clear and informative access documents."
https://openalex.org/W2751543589,"In the thymus, cortical and medullary thymic epithelial cells (TECs) are instrumental for generating a repertoire of functional T cells. Hence, there has been much interest in the ontogeny of TECs. While medullary TEC (mTEC) and bipotent progenitors have been identified, the existence of a cortical TEC (cTEC) progenitor remains ambiguous. In this study, we used lineage tracing based on a target gene of the Wnt pathway, Axin2. We found that Axin2 initially labels cells in both the cortical and medullary compartments. Using Axin2-CreERT2 mice to track the fate of labelled cells, we identified long-lived cortical TEC progenitors that give rise to expanding clones and contribute to homeostasis in postnatal thymus. In contrast, no clonal expansion was found in the medullary or in the K5K8-double positive compartments. The identification of cTEC progenitors and their regulation by Wnt signaling have important implications for our understanding of thymus physiology during homeostasis and TEC-related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2752300329,"It has been well established that maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) for 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) is clinically useful for evaluating treatment efficacy as well as predicting prognosis of breast cancer patients. Although SUVmax reflects increased glucose uptake and metabolism possibly induced by activation of growth factor signaling or TP53 dysfunction, tumor characteristics of SUVmax-high breast cancers remain to be elucidated. For the present study, we used immunohistochemical staining to investigate expressions of phospho-ribosomal protein S6 (pS6, downstream molecule of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of the rapamycin/S6K pathway) and phosphor-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (pMAPK). Expression levels of TP53 and proliferative marker geminin as well as Ki67 were also examined by means of immunostaining in 163 invasive breast cancers. Cutoff values were set at 10% for pS6, 20% for pMAPK and TP53, and 4% for geminin. The SUVmax levels were significantly higher in the pS6-positive (p = 0.0173), TP53-positive (p = 0.0207) and geminin-high cancers (p<0.0001), but there was no significant association between pMAPK expression levels and SUVmax levels. Multivariable analysis showed that a high geminin level (odds ratio: 6.497, 95% confidence interval: 2.427–19.202, p = 0.0001) and large tumor size (6.438, 2.224–20.946, p = 0.0005) were significantly and independently associated with SUVmax-high. Univariable but not multivariable analysis indicated that Ki67-high significantly correlated with SUVmax-high. Twenty of 23 (87.0%) breast cancers with tumor size >2cm and geminin-high showed SUVmax-high, while only 6 of 49 (12.2%) breast cancers ≤2cm in size and with low geminin levels were SUVmax-high. In conclusion, we could determine that breast cancers with a large tumor and a geminin-high rather than Ki67-high proliferative marker were significantly associated with high levels of SUVmax. These findings may signify that SUVmax reflects tumor characteristics with high proliferative activity but not activation of mTOR/S6K and MAPK pathways or increased glucose metabolism due to dysfunction of TP53."
https://openalex.org/W2750974052,"Currently, spatial and temporal changes in nutrients availability, marine planktonic, and fish communities are best described on a shorter than inter-annual (seasonal) scale, primarily because the simultaneous year-to-year variations in physical, chemical, and biological parameters are very complex. The limited availability of time series datasets furnishing simultaneous evaluations of temperature, nutrients, plankton, and fish have limited our ability to describe and to predict variability related to short-term process, as species-specific phenology and environmental seasonality. In the present study, we combine a computational time series analysis on a 15-year (1995–2009) weekly-sampled time series (high-resolution long-term time series, 780 weeks) with an Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model to track non-seasonal changes in 10 potentially related parameters: sea surface temperature, nutrient concentrations (NO2, NO3, NH4 and PO4), phytoplankton biomass (as in situ chlorophyll a biomass), meroplankton (barnacle and mussel larvae), and fish abundance (Mugil liza and Caranx latus). Our data demonstrate for the first time that highly intense and frequent upwelling years initiate a huge energy flux that is not fully transmitted through classical size-structured food web by bottom-up stimulus but through additional ontogenetic steps. A delayed inter-annual sequential effect from phytoplankton up to top predators as carnivorous fishes is expected if most of energy is trapped into benthic filter feeding organisms and their larval forms. These sequential events can explain major changes in ecosystem food web that were not predicted in previous short-term models."
https://openalex.org/W2753006821,"This study sought to explore the influence of different body weight statuses on 24-hour urine compositions in adults without urolithiasis based on a nationwide study of a Chinese Han population.Twenty-four-hour urine samples from 584 Chinese Han adults without urolithiasis in six cities were analyzed. The participants were divided into four body weight status types according to their body mass indices (BMIs) according to WHO guidelines. The baseline characteristics and 24-hour urine compositions of the standard weight group were compared with those of the underweight, overweight and obese groups. The influences of different body weight statuses on the 24-hour urine compositions were explored using univariate and multivariate logistic regressions.The numbers of participants in the underweight, standard weight, overweight and obese status groups were 24, 376, 149 and 35, respectively. The overweight and obese groups suffered significantly higher risks of hypertension and diabetes mellitus than the standard weight group. In the univariate analyses, compared with the standard weight group, the overweight group had significantly higher levels of urine citrate (mean difference [MD] = 0.51 mmol, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.15-0.87, P = 0.001), potassium (MD = 6.63 mmol, 95% CI: 1.13-12.14, P = 0.01) and magnesium (MD = 0.38 mmol, 95% CI: 0.08-0.69, P = 0.014). Significant increases in urine citrate (MD = 0.85 mmol, 95% CI: 0.01-1.68, P = 0.046), magnesium (MD = 0.69 mmol, 95% CI: 0.13-1.25, P = 0.016) and phosphate (MD = 2.28 mmol, 95% CI: 0.03-4.54, P = 0.047) were found in the obese group. No significant differences were detected between the standard weight and underweight groups. In the multivariate logistic regression analyses, we only observed significantly higher levels of urine potassium (odds ratio [OR] = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00-1.04, P = 0.03) in the overweight group and phosphate (OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.05-1.66, P = 0.018) in the obese group when compared with the standard weight group.Nonstone-forming adults with overweight or obese statuses were at higher risks of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Obese nonstone-formers might have a greater risk of urinary stone formation due to increased urinary phosphate excretion. Additionally, underweight status had no influence on 24-hour urine composition."
https://openalex.org/W2751500209,"Calsequestrin-2 (CASQ2) is the main Ca2+-binding protein inside the sarcoplasmic reticulum of cardiomyocytes. Previously, we demonstrated that MEF-2 and SRF binding sites within the human CASQ2 gene (hCASQ2) promoter region are functional in neonatal cardiomyocytes. In this work, we investigated if the calcineurin/NFAT pathway regulates hCASQ2 expression in neonatal cardiomyocytes. The inhibition of NFAT dephosphorylation with CsA or INCA-6, reduced both the luciferase activity of hCASQ2 promoter constructs (-3102/+176 bp and -288/+176 bp) and the CASQ2 mRNA levels in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Additionally, NFATc1 and NFATc3 over-expressing neonatal cardiomyocytes showed a 2-3-fold increase in luciferase activity of both hCASQ2 promoter constructs, which was prevented by CsA treatment. Site-directed mutagenesis of the -133 bp MEF-2 binding site prevented trans-activation of hCASQ2 promoter constructs induced by NFAT overexpression. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed NFAT and MEF-2 enrichment within the -288 bp to +76 bp of the hCASQ2 gene promoter. Besides, a direct interaction between NFAT and MEF-2 proteins was demonstrated by protein co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Taken together, these data demonstrate that NFAT interacts with MEF-2 bound to the -133 bp binding site at the hCASQ2 gene promoter. In conclusion, in this work, we demonstrate that the Ca2+-calcineurin/NFAT pathway modulates the transcription of the hCASQ2 gene in neonatal cardiomyocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2752164728,"Alkylating agents are ubiquitous in our internal and external environments, causing DNA damage that contributes to mutations and cell death that can result in aging, tissue degeneration and cancer. Repair of methylated DNA bases occurs primarily through the base excision repair (BER) pathway, a multi-enzyme pathway initiated by the alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (Aag, also known as Mpg). Previous work demonstrated that mice treated with the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) undergo cerebellar degeneration in an Aag-dependent manner, whereby increased BER initiation by Aag causes increased tissue damage that is dependent on activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (Parp1). Here, we dissect the molecular mechanism of cerebellar granule neuron (CGN) sensitivity to MMS using primary ex vivo neuronal cultures. We first established a high-throughput fluorescent imaging method to assess primary neuron sensitivity to treatment with DNA damaging agents. Next, we verified that the alkylation sensitivity of CGNs is an intrinsic phenotype that accurately recapitulates the in vivo dependency of alkylation-induced CGN cell death on Aag and Parp1 activity. Finally, we show that MMS-induced CGN toxicity is independent of all the cellular events that have previously been associated with Parp-mediated toxicity, including mitochondrial depolarization, AIF translocation, calcium fluxes, and NAD+ consumption. We therefore believe that further investigation is needed to adequately describe all varieties of Parp-mediated cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2752317764,"Cell penetrating peptides, also known as protein transduction domains, have the capacity to ubiquitously cross cellular membranes carrying many different cargos with negligible cytotoxicity. As a result, they have emerged as a powerful tool for macromolecular delivery-based therapies. In this study, catalytically active bacterial Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (LepFNR) and Heme oxygenase (LepHO) fused to the HIV TAT-derived protein transduction peptide (TAT) were efficiently transduced to neuroblastoma SHSY-5Y cells. Proteins entered the cells through an endocytic pathway showing a time/concentration dependent mechanism that was clearly modulated by the nature of the cargo protein. Since ferredoxin-NADP+ reductases and heme oxygenases have been implicated in mechanisms of oxidative stress defense, neuroblastoma cells simultaneously transduced with TAT-LepFNR and TAT-LepHO were challenged by H2O2 incubations to judge the cytoprotective power of these bacterial enzymes. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species was significantly reduced in these transduced neuronal cells. Moreover, measurements of metabolic viability, membrane integrity, and cell survival indicated that these cells showed a better tolerance to oxidative stress. Our results open the possibility for the application of transducible active redox proteins to overcome the damage elicited by oxidative stress in cells and tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2751315394,"The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has increasingly been suspected of adverse effects in Denmark since 2013. By using consultations with the general practitioner (GP) as an indicator for morbidity, this study aims to examine the association between HPV vaccination and morbidity in girls in the Danish childhood immunization program.The study is a nationwide register-based cohort study. Both the HPV and the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccines were offered to 12-year-old girls in Denmark in the study period (2008-2015). Therefore, both vaccines were included as exposures to allow differentiation between potential effects. This resulted in four exposure groups: HPV only vaccinated, HPV+MMR vaccinated, MMR only vaccinated, and Non-vaccinated girls. Outcomes were: daytime consultation rates and frequent GP attendance (> 7 annual GP consultations). We estimated consultation rates by negative binomial regressions analysis and frequent GP attendance by logistic regression analysis. Both analyses were stratified on the years 2008-2013 versus 2014.The study included 214,240 girls born in 1996-2002. All vaccinated groups consulted the GP more often than the non-vaccinated group, both before and after the vaccination. After the vaccination, an increase in consultations was observed for all three vaccinated groups; most distinct for girls vaccinated in 2014. For girls vaccinated before 2014, we found a slightly higher risk of frequent GP attendance after vaccination in the HPV only group compared to the non-vaccinated group, whereas in 2014, frequent GP attendance was seen for all three vaccinated groups; most substantial for the MMR only vaccinated group.In this study, no exclusive increase in health care utilization was detected after HPV vaccination. However, a general difference in the health care utilization pattern was found between vaccinated and non-vaccinated girls, which increased after the time of vaccination, primarily for girls vaccinated after 2013."
https://openalex.org/W2752727948,"Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) represent important modulators of plaque stability in advanced lesions. We previously reported that loss of small proline-rich repeat protein 3 (Sprr3), leads to VSMC apoptosis in a PI3K/Akt-dependent manner and accelerates lesion progression. Here, we investigated the role of Sprr3 in modulating plaque stability in hyperlipidemic ApoE-/- mice. We show that loss of Sprr3 increased necrotic core size and reduced cap collagen content of atheromas in brachiocephalic arteries with evidence of plaque rupture and development of intraluminal thrombi. Moreover, Sprr3-/-ApoE-/- mice developed advanced coronary artery lesions accompanied by intraplaque hemorrhage and left ventricle microinfarcts. SPRR3 is known to reduce VSMC survival in lesions by promoting their apoptosis. In addition, we demonstrated that Sprr3-/- VSMCs displayed reduced expression of procollagen in a PI3K/Akt dependent manner. SPRR3 loss also increased MMP gelatinase activity in lesions, and increased MMP2 expression, migration and contraction of VSMCs independently of PI3K/Akt. Consequently, Sprr3 represents the first described VSMC modulator of each of the critical features of cap stability, including VSMC numbers, collagen type I synthesis, and protease activity through Akt dependent and independent pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2753184678,"Although recent developments in DNA sequencing have allowed for great leaps in both the quality and quantity of genome assembly projects, de novo assemblies still lack the efficiency and accuracy required for studying genetic variation of individuals. Thus, efficient and accurate methods for calling and genotyping genetic variants are fundamental to studying the genomes of individuals. We study the problem of genotyping insertion variants. We assume that the location of the insertion is given, and the task is to find the insertion sequence. Insertions are the hardest structural variant to genotype, because the insertion sequence must be assembled from the reads, whereas genotyping other structural variants only requires transformations of the reference genome. The current methods for constructing insertion variants are mostly linked to variation calling methods and are only able to construct small insertions. A sub-problem in genome assembly, the gap filling problem, provides techniques that are readily applicable to insertion genotyping. Gap filling takes the context and length of a missing sequence in a genome assembly and attempts to assemble the intervening sequence. In this paper we show how tools and methods for gap filling can be used to assemble insertion variants by modeling the problem of insertion genotyping as filling gaps in the reference genome. We further give a general read filtering scheme to make the method scalable to large data sets. Our results show that gap filling methods are competitive against insertion genotyping tools. We further show that read filtering improves performance of insertion genotyping especially for long insertions. Our experiments show that on long insertions the new proposed method is the most accurate one, whereas on short insertions it has comparable performance as compared against existing tools."

Specifically, it is believed that travel time reliability is a key factor influencing travelers' route choice. Meanwhile, due to the limited cruising range, EV drivers need to better learn about the required energy for the whole trip to make decisions about whether charging or not and where to charge (i.e., charging reliability). Since EV energy consumption is highly related to travel speed, network uncertainty affects travel time and charging demand estimation significantly. Considering the network uncertainty resulted from link degradation, which influences the distribution of travel demand on transportation network and the energy demand on power network, this paper aims to develop a reliability-based network equilibrium framework for accommodating degradable road conditions with the addition of EVs. First, based on the link travel time distribution, the mean and variance of route travel time and monetary expenses related to energy consumption are deduced, respectively. And the charging time distribution of EVs with charging demand is also estimated. Then, a nested structure is considered to deal with the difference of route choice behavior derived by the different uncertainty degrees between the routes with and without degradable links. Given the expected generalized travel cost and a psychological safety margin, a traffic assignment model with the addition of EVs is formulated. Subsequently, a heuristic solution algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model. Finally, the effects of travelers' risk attitude, network degradation degree, and EV penetration rate on network performance are illustrated through an example network. The numerical results show that the difference of travelers' risk attitudes does have impact on the route choice, and the widespread adoption of EVs can cut down the total system travel cost effectively when the transportation network is more reliable."

Smudgy blurs in the distance resolve into trees with leaves dancing in a breeze, and featureless walls emerge as precisely stacked courses of bricks. Two simple lenses bring it all into focus. Gaining focus within a cell is not so simple. Take DNA, for example. Legendary experiments from the 1950s showed us the two strands. Milestone work through the years revealed the DNA-wrapped histone octamer, fibers, loops, and DNA-rich compartments within the nucleus (reviewed in Sexton and Cavalli, 2015Sexton T. Cavalli G. Cell. 2015; 160: 1049-1059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar and Zhu and Li, 2016Zhu P. Li G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2016; 36: 106-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Gaining focus on these entities required “lenses” of different sorts; no one technique would do. With all that’s known about how DNA is constructed, how it interacts with proteins, and how it packs within nuclei, it’s hard to image that we need better spectacles to understand chromatin and chromosomes. Yet recent advances have sharpened our view on how chromatin architecture contributes to gene expression. The word “nucleosome” almost immediately conjures the classic image of evenly spaced nucleosomes in a “beads on a string” level of chromatin organization. Recent work from Nozaki et al., 2017Nozaki T. Imai R. Tanbo M. Nagashima R. Tamura S. Tani T. Joti Y. Tomita M. Hibino K. Kanemaki M.T. et al.Mol. Cell. 2017; 67: 282-293.e7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar using super-resolution approaches and dynamic tracking finds that nucleosomes can bunch together and exhibit coherent dynamics. Bunching depends on nucleosomes interacting with one another. Heterochromatic regions have a high degree of bunching, while actively transcribed regions show less. The degree of bunching also reflects local dynamics with abundant nucleosome-nucleosome contacts, occurring through space, restricting motion. Active regions show greater movement. Thus, the chromatin state, including the presence or absence of histone modifications and DNA stabilizing proteins like cohesin, reflects dynamic behavior. These bunches reveal, at the hundreds of nanometers scale, organization emerging from nucleosome-nucleosome interactions. Cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET) also captures spatial information about chromatin organization in cells. Proteins and membranes are the most frequent subjects for cryo-ET, as DNA has been difficult to visualize. Ou and colleagues (Ou et al., 2017Ou H.D. Phan S. Deerinck T.J. Thor A. Ellisman M.H. O’Shea C.C. Science. 2017; 357: eaag0025Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) combined a photochemical treatment with osmium contrast in cryo-ET to enhance visualization of DNA within the nuclei of human cells. The new technique brought DNA into focus. Chromatin wends its way through the nucleus, bending and twisting. The strands show higher density near the periphery, consistent with the bunching results. The textbook model for DNA packing in the nucleus moves from nucleosome arrays to nanometer scale fibers, and while these weren’t visualized in the human cells studied, they could be seen in chicken erythrocytes under certain conditions. Looking at local polymer properties in human mitotic and interphase cells revealed extensive heterogeneity seen as bendability in the chromatin path. Rather than the conventional progression from DNA duplex to nucleosomal arrays to fiber to densely compacted chromosome, the authors suggest a model for packing that allows for regions of different density and pliability to facilitate packing, rather than an obligate assembly step into a 30 nm fiber. It’s a case where getting to see inside a cell challenges our models and will undoubtedly spark new experiments to test this folding proposition. Until we can visualize the full scope of dynamic DNA function directly, there will be a heavy reliance on more indirect approaches. The now-ubiquitous “C” methods allow inference of chromatin structure based on recovery and analysis of DNA sequences that were “captured” while close in space. Proximity serves as a constraint for projecting back to what specific sequences could come into close quarters in three dimensions, regardless of their arrangement along the linear chromosome. There are, however, technical limitations to the different steps involved in the different varieties of chromosome conformation capture. In an effort to more clearly see how regions of chromatin interact, Ana Pombo and her colleagues (Beagrie et al., 2017Beagrie R.A. Scialdone A. Schueler M. Kraemer D.C. Chotalia M. Xie S.Q. Barbieri M. de Santiago I. Lavitas L.M. Branco M.R. et al.Nature. 2017; 543: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) literally started slicing up murine cells. Using an ultrathin sectioning approach, they could analyze DNA fragments found in a geographically narrow region, which had a greater likelihood of physically interacting than DNAs from two separate sections. Looking at contacts that formed during gene expression, they found that not only do enhancers contact promoters of active genes, but the regulatory regions also make contact along gene bodies. Strikingly, superenhancers favor interacting with other superenhancers and active topologically associated domains (TADs). Thus, these larger-scale regulatory regions help organize chromatin beyond the level of TADs and lamina contacts. Like turning the focus knob on a microscope or getting a new prescription from the ophthalmologist, these new approaches show us levels of detail that we’ve been missing. DNA, you’re looking good."
