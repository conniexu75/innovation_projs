To date, the cloaks have been restricted to two dimensions, which limits realistic applications. Based on a photonic crystal structure with a polymer filling the empty space, Ergin et al. (p. 337 , published online 18 March) have designed, fabricated, and realized a three-dimensional cloak operating at optical wavelengths."
https://openalex.org/W1982593017,"A Fair Society Many of the social interactions of everyday life, especially those involving economic exchange, take place between individuals who are unrelated to each other and often do not know each other. Countless laboratory experiments have documented the propensity of subjects to behave fairly in these interactions and to punish those participants deemed to have behaved unfairly. Henrich et al. (p. 1480 , see the Perspective by Hoff ) measured fairness in thousands of individuals from 15 contemporary, small-scale societies to gain an understanding of the evolution of trustworthy exchange among human societies. Fairness was quantitated using three economic games. Various societal parameters, such as the extent to which food was purchased versus produced, were also collected. Institutions, as represented by markets, community size, and adherence to a world religion all predict a greater exercise of fairness in social exchange."

https://openalex.org/W2060093678,"At Sixes and Sevens Molecular synthesis and macroscopic aggregation have often been regarded as entirely separate processes. From the researcher's standpoint, once reagents have been mixed, synthesis is largely passive, whereas processes such as crystallization can be more actively manipulated. Carnall et al. (p. 1502 ) characterized an unusual system in which the formation of aggregated cyclic macromolecules (macrocycles) from small peptide-based building blocks was governed by intimately interdependent factors ranging from the scale of covalent bond formation all the way to micron scale fiber growth. As the macrocycles stacked against one another to form the fibers, they remained loosely bonded enough internally to incorporate or expel individual building blocks. Varying the type of mechanical force applied to the growing fibers (either through shaking or stirring the solution), alternately favored formation of either 6-membered or 7-membered covalent macrocycles."

A limitation for most metal-based shape memory alloys is the extent to which they can be deformed elastically. Tanaka et al. (p. 1488 ; see the Perspective by Ma and Karaman ) demonstrate an iron-based alloy that shows much higher levels of superelastic strain, surpassing the performance of nickel-titanium alloys. In addition to high superelastic strain, this ferrous shape memory alloy has much higher strength than NiTi and copper-based shape memory alloys and, consequently, a high-energy absorption capability. These properties may allow shape memory alloys to be exploited as strain sensors or energy dampers."

Using mice, Nakagawa et al. (p. 62 , published online 18 March) shed light on some of the properties of the murine germline stem cell system that contribute to its robustness. During steady-state spermatogenesis, the majority of the stem cell population lies within a subset of cells called type A spermatogonia. However, during regeneration (for example, during recovery of the stem cell pool after drug exposure) the system in essence hijacks early-differentiating cells back into the stem cell compartment. Lineage analysis and live-imaging also suggests that during sperm production there is more than one path from a stem cell to differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1995688623,"Battle of the Sperm In insects, sperm from multiple matings are stored and retained, and are thought to compete for ova within a female's reproductive tract. Manier et al. (p. 354 , published online 18 March) visualized sperm from fruit flies transgenically tagged with green or red fluorescent protein within the reproductive tracts of female flies. Sperm showed more mobility within the female storage organs than expected, with those from the most recent copulation displacing sperm from previous males; however, sperm viability remained consistent over long-term storage and each male's sperm was equally competitive in fertilizing the female's eggs."
https://openalex.org/W2091303550,"Like Father, Like Mother, Like Child Transcriptional regulation is mediated by chromatin structure, which may affect the binding of transcription factors, but the extent of how individual-to-individual genetic variation affects such regulation is not well understood. Kasowski et al. (p. 232 , published online 18 March) investigated the binding of two transcription factors across the genomes of human individuals and one chimpanzee. Transcription factor binding was associated with genomic features such as nucleotide variation, insertions and deletions, and copy number variation. Thus, genomic sequence variation affects transcription factor binding and may explain expression difference among individuals. McDaniell et al. (p. 235 , published online 18 March) provide a genome-wide catalog of variation in chromatin and transcription factor binding in two parent-child trios of European and African ancestry. Up to 10% of active chromatin binding sites were specific to a set of individuals and were often inherited. Furthermore, variation in active chromatin sites showed heritable allele-specific correlation with variation in gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2058729474,"Background Green roofs perform ecosystem services such as summer roof temperature reduction and stormwater capture that directly contribute to lower building energy use and potential economic savings. These services are in turn related to ecosystem functions performed by the vegetation layer such as radiation reflection and transpiration, but little work has examined the role of plant species composition and diversity in improving these functions. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a replicated modular extensive (shallow growing- medium) green roof system planted with monocultures or mixtures containing one, three or five life-forms, to quantify two ecosystem services: summer roof cooling and water capture. We also measured the related ecosystem properties/processes of albedo, evapotranspiration, and the mean and temporal variability of aboveground biomass over four months. Mixtures containing three or five life-form groups, simultaneously optimized several green roof ecosystem functions, outperforming monocultures and single life-form groups, but there was much variation in performance depending on which life-forms were present in the three life-form mixtures. Some mixtures outperformed the best monocultures for water capture, evapotranspiration, and an index combining both water capture and temperature reductions. Combinations of tall forbs, grasses and succulents simultaneously optimized a range of ecosystem performance measures, thus the main benefit of including all three groups was not to maximize any single process but to perform a variety of functions well. Conclusions/Significance Ecosystem services from green roofs can be improved by planting certain life-form groups in combination, directly contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. The strong performance by certain mixtures of life-forms, especially tall forbs, grasses and succulents, warrants further investigation into niche complementarity or facilitation as mechanisms governing biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships in green roof ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2025577942,"Study of drug-target interaction networks is an important topic for drug development. It is both time-consuming and costly to determine compound-protein interactions or potential drug-target interactions by experiments alone. As a complement, the in silico prediction methods can provide us with very useful information in a timely manner.To realize this, drug compounds are encoded with functional groups and proteins encoded by biological features including biochemical and physicochemical properties. The optimal feature selection procedures are adopted by means of the mRMR (Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy) method. Instead of classifying the proteins as a whole family, target proteins are divided into four groups: enzymes, ion channels, G-protein- coupled receptors and nuclear receptors. Thus, four independent predictors are established using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm as their operation engine, with each to predict the interactions between drugs and one of the four protein groups. As a result, the overall success rates by the jackknife cross-validation tests achieved with the four predictors are 85.48%, 80.78%, 78.49%, and 85.66%, respectively.Our results indicate that the network prediction system thus established is quite promising and encouraging."
https://openalex.org/W1972633518,"When oxygen becomes limiting, cells reduce mitochondrial respiration and increase ATP production through anaerobic fermentation of glucose. The Hypoxia Inducible Factors (HIFs) play a key role in this metabolic shift by regulating the transcription of key enzymes of glucose metabolism. Here we show that oxygen regulates the expression of the muscle glycogen synthase (GYS1). Hypoxic GYS1 induction requires HIF activity and a Hypoxia Response Element within its promoter. GYS1 gene induction correlated with a significant increase in glycogen synthase activity and glycogen accumulation in cells exposed to hypoxia. Significantly, knockdown of either HIF1α or GYS1 attenuated hypoxia-induced glycogen accumulation, while GYS1 overexpression was sufficient to mimic this effect. Altogether, these results indicate that GYS1 regulation by HIF plays a central role in the hypoxic accumulation of glycogen. Importantly, we found that hypoxia also upregulates the expression of UTP:glucose-1-phosphate urydylyltransferase (UGP2) and 1,4-α glucan branching enzyme (GBE1), two enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of glycogen. Therefore, hypoxia regulates almost all the enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism in a coordinated fashion, leading to its accumulation. Finally, we demonstrated that abrogation of glycogen synthesis, by knock-down of GYS1 expression, impairs hypoxic preconditioning, suggesting a physiological role for the glycogen accumulated during chronic hypoxia. In summary, our results uncover a novel effect of hypoxia on glucose metabolism, further supporting the central importance of metabolic reprogramming in the cellular adaptation to hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2082684480,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 18-23 nucleotide non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression in a sequence specific manner. Little is known about the repertoire and function of miRNAs in melanoma or the melanocytic lineage. We therefore undertook a comprehensive analysis of the miRNAome in a diverse range of pigment cells including: melanoblasts, melanocytes, congenital nevocytes, acral, mucosal, cutaneous and uveal melanoma cells.We sequenced 12 small RNA libraries using Illumina's Genome Analyzer II platform. This massively parallel sequencing approach of a diverse set of melanoma and pigment cell libraries revealed a total of 539 known mature and mature-star sequences, along with the prediction of 279 novel miRNA candidates, of which 109 were common to 2 or more libraries and 3 were present in all libraries.Some of the novel candidate miRNAs may be specific to the melanocytic lineage and as such could be used as biomarkers to assist in the early detection of distant metastases by measuring the circulating levels in blood. Follow up studies of the functional roles of these pigment cell miRNAs and the identification of the targets should shed further light on the development and progression of melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2060004156,"Background Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), an inherited disorder of the NADPH oxidase in which phagocytes are defective in generating superoxide anion and downstream reactive oxidant intermediates (ROIs), is characterized by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections and by excessive inflammation (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease). The mechanisms by which NADPH oxidase regulates inflammation are not well understood. Methodology/Principal Findings We found that NADPH oxidase restrains inflammation by modulating redox-sensitive innate immune pathways. When challenged with either intratracheal zymosan or LPS, NADPH oxidase-deficient p47phox−/− mice and gp91phox-deficient mice developed exaggerated and progressive lung inflammation, augmented NF-κB activation, and elevated downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-17, and G-CSF) compared to wildtype mice. Replacement of functional NADPH oxidase in bone marrow-derived cells restored the normal lung inflammatory response. Studies in vivo and in isolated macrophages demonstrated that in the absence of functional NADPH oxidase, zymosan failed to activate Nrf2, a key redox-sensitive anti-inflammatory regulator. The triterpenoid, CDDO-Im, activated Nrf2 independently of NADPH oxidase and reduced zymosan-induced lung inflammation in CGD mice. Consistent with these findings, zymosan-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from X-linked CGD patients showed impaired Nrf2 activity and increased NF-κB activation. Conclusions/Significance These studies support a model in which NADPH oxidase-dependent, redox-mediated signaling is critical for termination of lung inflammation and suggest new potential therapeutic targets for CGD."
https://openalex.org/W1987762375,"The onset of puberty defines a developmental stage when some learning processes are diminished, but the mechanism for this deficit remains unknown. We found that, at puberty, expression of inhibitory alpha4betadelta gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors (GABAR) increases perisynaptic to excitatory synapses in CA1 hippocampus. Shunting inhibition via these receptors reduced N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation, impairing induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Pubertal mice also failed to learn a hippocampal, LTP-dependent spatial task that was easily acquired by delta-/- mice. However, the stress steroid THP (3alphaOH-5alpha[beta]-pregnan-20-one), which reduces tonic inhibition at puberty, facilitated learning. Thus, the emergence of alpha4betadelta GABARs at puberty impairs learning, an effect that can be reversed by a stress steroid."

(p. 1522 ) present a general theoretical framework that quantitatively describes coupled cyclic processes and then apply this to the interaction between the circadian and cell-division cycles in single cyanobacteria. Simultaneously tracking individual cell divisions and circadian phases and fitting the data with the model suggest that cell-cycle progression slows down dramatically during a specific circadian interval, whereas cell-cycle progression is independent of the cell-cycle phase."
https://openalex.org/W2120763912,"Pathophysiological aldosterone (aldo)/ mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) signaling has significant effects on the cardiovascular system, resulting in hypertension and cardiovascular remodeling; however, the specific contribution of the vascular MR to blood pressure regulation remains to be established. To address this question, we generated a mouse model with conditional overexpression of the MR in endothelial cells (MR-EC). In basal conditions, MR-EC mice developed moderate hypertension that could be reversed by canrenoate, a pharmacological MR antagonist. MR-EC mice presented increased contractile response of resistance arteries to vasoconstrictors (phenylephrine, thromboxane A2 analog, angiotensin II, and endothelin 1) in the absence of vascular morphological alterations. The acute blood pressure response to angiotensin II or endothelin 1 infusion was increased in MR-EC mice compared with that in littermate controls. These observations demonstrate that enhanced MR activation in the endothelium generates an increase in blood pressure, independent of stimulation of renal tubular Na+ transport by aldo/MR or direct activation of smooth muscle MR and establish one mechanism by which endothelial MR activation per se may contribute to impaired vascular reactivity.—Nguyen Dinh Cat, A., Griol-Charhbili, V., Loufrani, L., Labat, C, Benjamin, L., Farman, N., Lacolley, P., Henrion, D., and Jaisser, F.

Walther et al.

The use of established patterning techniques and tunable superlattice structures offer the prospect of shrinking the size still further, as well as providing a route to designer laser output for high-speed information transport and optical processing."
https://openalex.org/W2020795237,"Messy Mountain Meandering Predicting the influence of climate on landscapes is sometimes straightforward; for example, river deposits might grow with increased rainfall because erosion rates and sediment transport increase. However, long-term tectonic processes complicate the geomorphic signatures of more gradual climate-related phenomena that reconfigure landscapes. By correlating a decades-long record of typhoon rainfall in Japan with digital elevation models, Stark et al. (p. 1497 ) show that climate directly influences the extent of river meandering. When expanded to a larger region of the western North Pacific, this analysis revealed a strong climatic imprint on the landscape of humid mountainous areas. The region-wide analysis also revealed that underlying bedrock strength, as opposed to tectonic uplift, acts as a secondary control."
https://openalex.org/W2082688084,"Taming Turbulence When fluid flows through a pipe, if the inertial forces are increased or the viscosity is decreased, the flow will become increasing noisy and will shift from being laminar to turbulent. Turbulence can be triggered by roughness in the pipe or other irregularities, which cause local eddies that grow into full-scale disruption of the otherwise smooth flow. Hof et al. (p. 1491 ; see the Perspective by McKeon ) show that a continuous turbulent eddy, downstream, eliminates the growth of upstream disturbances and can prevent the overall flow from becoming turbulent. Unlike many other control methods, the energy cost for implementing this strategy is less than the benefit gained by maintaining a laminar flow."

https://openalex.org/W2079225190,"Background Wolbachia bacteria have invaded many arthropod species by inducing Cytoplasmic Incompatibility (CI). These symbionts represent fascinating objects of study for evolutionary biologists, but also powerful potential biocontrol agents. Here, we assess the density dynamics of Wolbachia infections in males and females of the mosquito Aedes albopitcus, an important vector of human pathogens, and interpret the results within an evolutionary framework. Methodology/Principal Findings Wolbachia densities were measured in natural populations and in age controlled mosquitoes using quantitative PCR. We show that the density dynamics of the wAlbA Wolbachia strain infecting Aedes albopictus drastically differ between males and females, with a very rapid decay of infection in males only. Conclusions/Significance Theory predicts that Wolbachia and its hosts should cooperate to improve the transmission of infection to offspring, because only infected eggs are protected from the effects of CI. However, incompatible matings effectively lower the fertility of infected males, so that selection acting on the host genome should tend to reduce the expression of CI in males, for example, by reducing infection density in males before sexual maturation. The rapid decay of one Wolbachia infection in Aedes albopictus males, but not in females, is consistent with this prediction. We suggest that the commonly observed reduction in CI intensity with male age reflects a similar evolutionary process. Our results also highlight the importance of monitoring infection density dynamics in both males and females to assess the efficiency of Wolbachia-based control strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2051765368,"The TGF-β family of mediators are thought to play important roles in the regulation of inflammation and airway remodelling in asthma. All three mammalian isoforms of TGF-β, TGF-β1–3, are expressed in the airways and TGF-β1 and -β2 are increased in asthma. However, there is little information on the specific roles of individual TGF-β isoforms. In this study we assess the roles of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 in the regulation of allergen-induced airway inflammation and remodelling associated with asthma, using a validated murine model of ovalbumin sensitization and challenge, and isoform specific TGF-β neutralising antibodies. Antibodies to both isoforms inhibited TGF-β mediated Smad signalling. Anti-TGF-β1 and anti-TGF-β2 inhibited ovalbumin-induced sub-epithelial collagen deposition but anti-TGF-β1 also specifically regulated airway and fibroblast decorin deposition by TGF-β1. Neither antibody affected the allergen-induced increase in sub-epithelial fibroblast-like cells. Anti- TGF-β1 also specifically inhibited ovalbumin-induced increases in monocyte/macrophage recruitment. Whereas, both TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 were involved in regulating allergen-induced increases in eosinophil and lymphocyte numbers. These data show that TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 exhibit a combination of specific and shared roles in the regulation of allergen-induced airway inflammation and remodelling. They also provide evidence in support of the potential for therapeutic regulation of specific subsets of cells and extracellular matrix proteins associated with inflammation and remodelling in airway diseases such as asthma and COPD, as well as other fibroproliferative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1983308621,"Redox-based mechanisms play critical roles in the regulation of multiple cellular functions. NF-κB, a master regulator of inflammation, is an inducible transcription factor generally considered to be redox-sensitive, but the modes of interactions between oxidant stress and NF-κB are incompletely defined. Here, we show that oxidants can either amplify or suppress NF-κB activation in vitro by interfering both with positive and negative signals in the NF-κB pathway. NF-κB activation was evaluated in lung A549 epithelial cells stimulated with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), either alone or in combination with various oxidant species, including hydrogen peroxide or peroxynitrite. Exposure to oxidants after TNFα stimulation produced a robust and long lasting hyperactivation of NF-κB by preventing resynthesis of the NF-κB inhibitor IκB, thereby abrogating the major negative feedback loop of NF-κB. This effect was related to continuous activation of inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK), due to persistent IKK phosphorylation consecutive to oxidant-mediated inactivation of protein phosphatase 2A. In contrast, exposure to oxidants before TNFα stimulation impaired IKK phosphorylation and activation, leading to complete prevention of NF-κB activation. Comparable effects were obtained when interleukin-1β was used instead of TNFα as the NF-κB activator. This study demonstrates that the influence of oxidants on NF-κB is entirely context-dependent, and that the final outcome (activation versus inhibition) depends on a balanced inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A and IKK by oxidant species. Our findings provide a new conceptual framework to understand the role of oxidant stress during inflammatory processes.

Our findings provide a new conceptual framework to understand the role of oxidant stress during inflammatory processes. Oxidant stress is a critical pathophysiological mechanism that stands at the foreground of a number of inflammatory diseases. In such conditions, highly reactive oxygen and nitrogen species exert their biological activity by inflicting various oxidative damages to biomolecules and by modulating the activity of redox-sensitive signal transduction pathways (1Pacher P. Beckman J.S. Liaudet L. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 315-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (4629) Google Scholar). The transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) 2The abbreviations used are: NF-κBnuclear factor κBIKKIκB kinasePNperoxynitriteTNFαtumor necrosis factor αPBSphosphate-buffered salineILinterleukinOAokadaic acidEMSAelectromobility shift assayPP2Aprotein phosphatase 2A. is a master regulator of inflammation and apoptosis, which is considered a prototypical example of such sensitivity to oxidant stress (2Gloire G. Legrand-Poels S. Piette J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 1493-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a family of dimeric proteins normally retained in the cytoplasm of nonstimulated cells, bound to inhibitory proteins, the IκBs (3Ghosh S. Hayden M.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). The critical step in NF-κB activation relies on its dissociation from the IκB protein, resulting from stimulus-induced phosphorylation of IκB, followed by its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. IκB itself is phosphorylated by IκB kinase (IKK), composed of a heterodimer of two catalytic subunits, IKKα/β, and a regulatory subunit, IKKγ (4Karin M. Cell Res. 2008; 18: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). A considerable variety of stimuli lead to IKK activation and downstream NF-κB signaling, comprising inflammatory cytokines, various microbial components, as well as genotoxic, physical, or chemical stress factors (5Hayden M.S.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3415) Google Scholar) that NF-κB could be activated directly by H2O2 in a subclone of Jurkat cells, a number of experimental studies have lent support to the concept that NF-κB activation is mediated via a redox-based mechanism (for review, see Ref. 2Gloire G. Legrand-Poels S. Piette J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 1493-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). The underlying molecular mechanisms were shown to involve either IKK-dependent IκBα serine phosphorylation (7Kamata H. Manabe T. Oka S. Kamata K. Hirata H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 519: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) or tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα at Tyr42 (8Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B. Mueller-Dieckmann C.

Recently however, the sensitivity of NF-κB to oxidant stress has been brought into question by a series of investigations showing that oxidant stress activates NF-κB only in some, but not all cell types (for review, see Ref. 9Pantano C. Reynaert N.L. van der Vliet A. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 1791-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar).

Similar inhibition of IKK has also been observed with various biochemical agents triggering oxidation of cysteine 179 in IKKβ (14Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar, 15Kapahi P. Takahashi T. Natoli G. Adams S.R. Chen Y. Tsien R.Y. Karin M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 18223-18228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, NF-κB modulation by oxidants appears largely unpredictable and dependent on the cell type studied and the kind of redox stimulus. An essential aspect of NF-κB signaling is its transient nature, which requires short term activation and tight regulation by negative feedback loops (17Barisic S. Strozyk E. Peters N. Walczak H. Kulms D. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Given the multiplicity of their biological targets, oxidants might be able to modulate both positive and negative signals in the NF-κB pathway, and the balance between these contrasted influences might dictate the final outcome (activation or inhibition) on NF-κB. To address this hypothesis, lung A549 cells were stimulated with TNFα before or after a short exposure to oxidant stress conditions. Preexposure to oxidant stress prevented TNFα-mediated NF-κB activation by impairing IKK phosphorylation, whereas postexposure to oxidant stress markedly increased and prolonged TNFα-mediated NF-κB activation by suppressing phosphatase-dependent IKK dephosphorylation. Thus, oxidants can inactivate both kinases and phosphatases in the NF-κB signaling pathway and may thereby either suppress or amplify TNFα-dependent NF-κB activation. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of NF-κB regulation in conditions of oxidant stress. Human lung carcinoma epithelial A549 cells and murine fibrosarcoma L929 cells were grown (5% CO2, 37 °C) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin.

Biol. Med. 2006; 41: 886-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, PN was delivered to the cells (in PBS-glucose medium) at a final concentration of 10–500 μm. In the preexposure protocol, cells were exposed to PN (or H2O2) for the indicated times, washed in PBS-glucose, and replaced in culture medium for stimulation with 10 ng/ml human TNFα (Pierce). In some experiments, human IL-1β (PreproTech, London, UK) was used (1 ng/ml) instead of TNFα. In the postexposure protocol, cells were first stimulated with TNFα for the indicated times, washed in PBS-glucose, and then treated with PN (or H2O2) for various periods, as indicated. In specified protocols, the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (OA; 100 nm) was used in place of the oxidants, as indicated. To mimic the postexposure protocol described above in a physiologically relevant condition, separate experiments were conducted in L929 cells stimulated with TNFα. Indeed, these cells are known to produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species upon TNFα stimulation (20Sánchez-Alcázar J.A. Schneider E. Hernández-Muñoz I. Ruiz-Cabello J. Siles-Rivas E. de la Torre P. Bornstein B. Brea G. Arenas J. Garesse R. Solís-Herruzo J.A. Knox A.J. Navas P. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 21Xue X.

The role of endogenously produced oxidants was evaluated by pretreating cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (25 mm) to prevent the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were obtained as described (13Levrand S. Pesse B. Feihl F. Waeber B. Pacher P. Rolli J. Schaller M.D. Liaudet L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34878-34887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thirty μg of cytoplasmic or 10 μg of nuclear proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by standard immunoblotting protocol, using the following primary antibodies: anti-NF-κB RelA/p65, anti-IκBα (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-IKKα, anti-IKKβ, anti-phospho-IKKα/β, and anti-α-tubulin (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), and followed by incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). EMSA was performed as described in detail, following incubation (20 min) of 10 μg of nuclear proteins with an [α-32P]dCTP-labeled NF-κB probe (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGG-3′) in EMSA buffer (13Levrand S.

Cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of a multimeric NF-κB pGL2 luciferase vector and 0.1 μg of the Renilla pRL-TK vector. Luciferase activity was determined and normalized as detailed in Ref. 13Levrand S. Pesse B. Feihl F. Waeber B. Pacher P. Rolli J. Schaller M.D. Liaudet L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34878-34887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar. IKK was immunoprecipitated, and the kinase reaction was performed by adding 1 μg of recombinant glutathione S-transferase-IκBα and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C, according to our previously published procedures (13Levrand S. Pesse B. Feihl F. Waeber B. Pacher P. Rolli J. Schaller M.D. Liaudet L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34878-34887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, and gels were fixed, dried, and examined by autoradiography. The concentration of IL-8 was determined in the medium of A549 cells stimulated with TNFα for 1 h followed by a 4-h posttreatment with H2O2, using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PP2A activity was determined with the serine-threonine phosphatase assay system obtained from Promega, using the PP2A-specific reaction buffer. A549 cells in 6-well plates were left untreated or were treated with PN (500 μm) or the PP2A inhibitor OA (100 nm) for 30, 60, or 90 min. Cells were then lysed, cleared by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 4 °C, 1 h), and supernatants were passed through Sephadex G-25 spin columns to remove free phosphate. 35 μl of the phosphate-free lysate was then incubated on a 96-well plate together with 5 μl of the phosphopeptide substrate RRA(pT)VA and 10 μl of PP2A-specific buffer for 30 min at 30 °C. After addition of a molybdate complex dye, formation of molybdate malachite green-phosphate complex was monitored at 600 nm (pmol of phosphate/μg of protein/min), and PP2A activity was expressed as a percentage of control conditions. In some experiments, the reaction was done directly in crude cell extracts obtained from untreated cells, in the presence of PN (500 μm) or OA (100 nm). Densitometric analyses of blots are shown as mean ± S.E. Comparisons were done by analysis of variance and Bonferroni adjustment. A p < 0.05 was considered significant. Stimulation of A549 cells with TNFα triggered the early (10 min) nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 and rapidly enhanced NF-κB-DNA binding activity (Fig. 1, A and B). In agreement with the classical mechanism of NF-κB activation, these effects were correlated with the early degradation of IκBα after 10 and 20 min, followed by a secondary increase of the IκBα signal starting at 30 min (Fig. 1C), consistent with IκBα resynthesis for negative feedback (13Levrand S. Pesse B. Feihl F. Waeber B. Pacher P. Rolli J. Schaller M.D. Liaudet L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34878-34887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). PN also activated NF-κB, albeit with different intensity and time course than TNFα. Indeed, p65 nuclear translocation and NF-κB-DNA binding were weaker and occurred later after PN, starting only after 20–30 min, and were associated with a delayed degradation of IκBα (Fig. 1, D–F). In contrast to TNFα, there was no detectable IκBα resynthesis up to 90 min after PN. Given that the signal for IκBα degradation is triggered by the activity of the upstream kinase IKK, we explored the influence of TNFα and PN on IKK activity. As illustrated in Fig. 1G, TNFα promoted rapid and robust activation of IKK that was sustained for 20 min followed by return to baseline activity. In contrast, PN induced a much weaker activation of IKK, which did not dissipate over time and remained sustained for 60 min. The initiation of IKK activity being mediated by its phosphorylation at 2 serine residues, we determined whether the different time courses of IKK activation by PN and TNFα were associated with differences in IKK phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 1H, IKK phosphorylation triggered by TNFα started after 5 min, peaked after 10 and 20 min, and then progressively returned to baseline levels, consistent with phosphatase-dependent IKK dephosphorylation (22DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). IKK was also phosphorylated in response to PN after 5–10 min, but, contrary to TNFα, such phosphorylation failed to be reversed and was maintained over 60 min. Cells were first stimulated for 30 min with TNFα to induce NF-κB activation and were subsequently treated with PN for 1 h. As indicated in Fig. 2A, such a sequence led to a significant enhancement of NF-κB-DNA binding activity, at concentrations of PN of 250 and 500 μm for 1 h. Control experiments using decomposed PN showed no effect. A comparable increase in NF-κB-DNA binding activity was observed when H2O2 was used instead of PN (supplemental Fig. S1). Similarly, p65 nuclear translocation was markedly enhanced by 500 μm PN for 1 h compared with a posttreatment with the PBS-glucose buffer (Fig. 2B). This was associated with an increased Ser536 phosphorylation of nuclear p65, an effect that was detected as early as 10 min after the addition of PN in time course experiments (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the expression of NF-κB-dependent genes was also affected by postexposure to oxidants. As indicated in Fig. 2D, NF-κB-dependent luciferase activity induced by TNFα was significantly enhanced by postexposure to 500 μm PN (Fig. 2D). In addition, the secretion of IL-8 (Fig. 2E) induced by TNFα was significantly greater when cells were exposed to H2O2 (500 μm) after TNFα. Finally, the role of endogenous oxidants on the process of NF-κB activation was also evaluated in L929 cells, which generate reactive oxygen species when stimulated with TNFα. As shown in Fig. 2F, NF-κB activation triggered by TNFα in L929 cells was largely reduced by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, indicating that oxidants produced in response to TNFα amplify the process of NF-κB activation in these cells. To explore the mechanisms of oxidant stress-dependent amplification of NF-κB activation by TNFα, we determined the influence of PN on the upstream activation of IKK and degradation of IκBα. Cells were first stimulated with TNFα for 10 min and then with PN (500 μm) or PBS-glucose buffer for 10–60 min. As shown in Fig. 3A, IKK phosphorylation triggered by TNFα was transient, with rapid dephosphorylation when cells were exposed to PBS-glucose buffer after TNFα. The concomitant degradation of IκBα was followed by robust IκBα resynthesis. In marked contrast, stimulation with PN after TNFα prevented IKK dephosphorylation up to 60 min, and this was associated with complete and persistent degradation of IκBα without any signs of IκBα resynthesis. The kinase activity of IKK triggered by TNFα was also profoundly enhanced by PN, as shown in Fig. 3B. This effect was evident as soon as 5 min after the addition of PN, as indicated by a 20-fold increase of IKK activity (Fig. 3, C and D). In a first set of experiments, total protein extracts from untreated cells were incubated with PN or OA for 30 min, followed by measurements of PP2A activity. As shown in Fig. 4A, both PN and OA produced a comparably potent inhibition of PP2A activity. In a second set of experiments, cells were first incubated with PN or OA for 30–90 min before measurements of PP2A activity. In such conditions, both PN and OA elicited a time-dependent significant reduction of PP2A activity (Fig. 4B). In a third set of experiments, cells were first activated with TNFα for 5 min and then with PBS-glucose buffer, PN, or OA for 1 h. As indicated in Fig. 4C, the phosphorylation of IKK after TNFα decreased rapidly in cells incubated with PBS-glucose, whereas it was sustained at a high level in cells incubated wit PN or OA. A549 cells were treated with concentrations of PN from 10 to 500 μm for 1 h and then with 10 ng/ml TNFα for 30 min. At concentrations of 50 μm and above, PN produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of NF-κB activation by TNFα, as evidenced by reduced degradation of IκBα (Fig. 5A) and NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation (Fig. 5B). Similarly, PN dose-dependently inhibited NF-κB-DNA binding (Fig. 5C), an effect that was similarly observed when H2O2 was used in place of PN (supplemental Fig. S1). These effects correlated with PN-dependent inhibition of IKK kinase, as indicated in Fig. 5D. IKK activity measured 10 min after TNFα was abrogated following preexposure (1 h) to PN. Furthermore, the induced luciferase expression following TNFα was abrogated when cells were preexposed to PN (1 h, 500 μm, Fig. 5E). Thus, transient exposure of A549 cells to oxidant stress conditions prevents subsequent IKK activation and downstream NF-κB signaling in response to TNFα, which agrees with our previous observations made in unrelated cell lines (13Levrand S. Pesse B. Feihl F. Waeber B. Pacher P. Rolli J. Schaller M.D. Liaudet L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34878-34887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cells were activated with IL-1β (30 min) instead of TNFα, and PN or PBS-glucose buffer was added for 1 h, either before or after IL-1β. As shown in Fig. 6A, NF-κB-DNA binding activity was greatly prevented by preexposure to PN, whereas it was reinforced by postexposure to PN. Similar observations were obtained in luciferase reporter experiments (Fig. 6B, upper panel). Preexposure to PN abrogated luciferase activity measured after 4-h stimulation with IL-1β, whereas postexposure enhanced such activity (Fig. 6B, lower panel). Defining the mechanisms of NF-κB regulation by oxidant stress is of major importance to understand the role of oxidants and free radicals in the pathophysiology of acute and chronic inflammation. Although it has generally been assumed that oxidants are direct NF-κB activators (for review, see Ref. 2Gloire G. Legrand-Poels S. Piette J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 1493-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar), recent findings have put this paradigm into question, by showing that oxidants rather inhibit NF-κB via oxidative inactivation of IKKβ (for review, see Ref. 9Pantano C. Reynaert N.L. van der Vliet A. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 1791-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In the current study, we hypothesized that such contrasted effects might reflect the ability of oxidants to interfere with both positive and negative signals in the NF-κB pathway so that the final outcome (activation versus inhibition) would depend on the balance between these two opposite signals. This issue was addressed by comparing the effects of the oxidants PN or H2O2, given alone or in various combinations with TNFα, in an in vitro cellular model. Oxidant stress on its own elicited a delayed activation of NF-κB compared with TNFα. This effect was associated with a continuous degradation of IκBα, contrasting with the early (within 30 min) resynthesis of IκBα observed after TNFα, indicating that this essential negative feedback loop was impaired in conditions of oxidant stress. The critical mechanism preventing continuous IκBα degradation is the transient nature of IKK activation, related to a well regulated balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of critical serine residues within the activation loop of IKKα and IKKβ (5Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3526) Google Scholar). Our finding of transient IKK phosphorylation and activation in response to TNFα is consistent with this concept. In contrast, oxidants triggered persistent IKK phosphorylation associated with long lasting kinase activity, indicating that proper dephosphorylation and inactivation of IKK were prevented in conditions of oxidant stress. Several recent lines of evidence support a critical role of the serine-threonine phosphatase PP2A in catalyzing IKK dephosphorylation leading to termination of IKK activity. First, PP2A is constitutively recruited to IKKβ (17Barisic S. Strozyk E. Peters N. Walczak H. Kulms D. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Witt J. Barisic S. Schumann E. Allgöwer F. Sawodny O. Sauter T. Kulms D. BMC Syst. Biol. 2009; 3: 71Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), where it appears to control dephosphorylation of randomly activated IKK (23Witt J. Barisic S. Schumann E. Allgöwer F. Sawodny O. Sauter T. Kulms D. BMC Syst. Biol. 2009; 3: 71Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Second, inactivation of PP2A with OA (22DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar), UVB (17Barisic S. Strozyk E. Peters N. Walczak H. Kulms D. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Witt J. Barisic S. Schumann E. Allgöwer F. Sawodny O. Sauter T. Kulms D. BMC Syst. Biol. 2009; 3: 71Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), or RNA interference (24Li S. Wang L. Berman M.A. Zhang Y. Dorf M.E. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) has been associated with persistent IKK activation and NF-κB activation. Therefore, our findings of sustained IKK phosphorylation and permanent IκBα degradation under oxidative conditions pointed to inactivation of PP2A as the most likely underlying mechanism, the more so that PP2A is especially sensitive to inactivation by various oxidant species (25Chen L. Liu L. Huang S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 45: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 26Kim H.S. Song M.C. Kwak I.H. Park T.J. Lim I.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37497-37510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 27Rao R.K. Clayton L.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was further supported by the striking enhancement of TNFα-dependent NF-κB activation observed when oxidants were applied after TNFα. In these conditions, IKK phosphorylation and activity persisted over time, and IκBα resynthesis was completely abrogated. This translated into a significant enhancement of the expression of NF-κB-dependent genes, as shown both by increased luciferase activity and IL-8 secretion when oxidants were applied after TNFα. To evaluate the biological significance of these findings, we determined whether endogenously produced reactive oxygen species would reproduce the effects of exogenously added oxidants. For this purpose, murine fibrosarcoma L929 cells, which produce H2O2 after TNFα (20Sánchez-Alcázar J.A. Schneider E. Hernández-Muñoz I. Ruiz-Cabello J. Siles-Rivas E. de la Torre P. Bornstein B. Brea G. Arenas J. Garesse R. Solís-Herruzo J.A. Knox A.J. Navas P. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 21Xue X. Piao J.H. Nakajima A. Sakon-Komazawa S. Kojima Y.

Chem. 2005; 280: 33917-33925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), were stimulated with TNFα in the presence of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. In such conditions, the activation of NF-κB by TNFα was markedly attenuated, indicating that oxidants produced after TNFα in these cells served to amplify the process of NF-κB activation. Overall, these findings support the concept that oxidants promote a prolonged activation of NF-κB following TNFα stimulation via a mechanism involving the prevention of phosphatase-dependent IKK dephosphorylation. We therefore directly evaluated the sensitivity of PP2A to oxidants in our experimental conditions and found that the latter was inhibited either when the oxidant was applied directly on isolated cellular proteins or when the assay was performed in cellular proteins isolated after stimulation with the oxidant. Importantly, comparable effects were obtained when PN was replaced by the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid: inhibition of PP2A activity with OA promoted persistent IKK phosphorylation when applied after TNFα. In addition to the sustained phosphorylation of IKK, we also noticed that TNFα-induced phosphorylation of Ser536 on nuclear p65 was enhanced after exposure to oxidants. This posttranslational modification of p65 has been shown to be essential for proper transcriptional activity of NF-κB (28Sakurai H. Suzuki S. Kawasaki N. Nakano H. Okazaki T. Chino A. Doi T. Saiki I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36916-36923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Recent findings have indicated that PP2A physically associates with p65 (29Yang J. Fan G.H. Wadzinski B.E. Sakurai H. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47828-47833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and that inhibition of PP2A with OA (29Yang J. Fan G.H. Wadzinski B.E. Sakurai H. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47828-47833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) or PP2A RNA interference (24Li S. Wang L. Berman M.A. Zhang Y. Dorf M.E. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) blocked p65-Ser536 dephosphorylation. Thus, the marked increase of Ser536 phosphorylation upon PN treatment is totally consistent with its ability to inhibit PP2A activity. In striking contrast with the above discussed results, preexposure to oxidant stress markedly inhibited NF-κB activation by TNFα, as indicated by reduced IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, impaired NF-κB DNA binding, and suppressed transcriptional activity, an effect related to the inhibition of TNFα-dependent activation of the kinase IKK (Fig. 4). We did not explore the mechanism underlying such inhibition, as this result confirmed our previous studies performed in unrelated cell lines (13Levrand S. Pesse B. Feihl F. Waeber B. Pacher P. Rolli J. Schaller M.D. Liaudet L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34878-34887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these findings are consistent with the oxidant-mediated abrogation of IKK activation and downstream signaling in response to cytokines reported in other cell systems in vitro (10Byun M.S. Jeon K.I. Choi J.W. Shim J.Y. Jue D.M. Exp. Mol. Med. 2002; 34: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Korn S.H. Wouters E.F. Vos N. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. J. Biol.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13086-13091Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Based on our current findings, we therefore propose a new scheme of interactions among oxidant stress, IKK, and NF-κB, based on oxidative inhibition of both IKK and PP2A, as depicted in Fig. 7. In such a model, oxidant-mediated inactivation of PP2A promotes a slow accumulation of randomly phosphorylated IKK, resulting in low grade, delayed activation of NF-κB. In the presence of an activating stimulus such as TNFα, the influence of oxidants will depend entirely on the initial phosphorylation status of IKK. If not yet phosphorylated at the time of oxidant addition, oxidized IKK will remain unresponsive to the activating stimulus, and NF-κB will not be activated. Alternatively, if already phosphorylated at the time of oxidant addition, IKK will not be dephosphorylated due to impaired PP2A activity, resulting in the amplification and prolongation of NF-κB activation. We believe that this model may explain the controversy surrounding the issue of the redox regulation of NF-κB. Because oxidant stress plays key roles in many chronic inflammatory diseases, antioxidant therapies are frequently considered as potentially suitable agents to treat or prevent such diseases, but large scale studies have failed to confirm such theoretical benefits (31Bjelakovic G. Gluud C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2007; 99: 742-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Our observations help explain these disappointing results by showing that the influence of oxidants on NF-κB signaling is entirely context-dependent. Understanding the complex interactions between oxidant stress and NF-κB should be an essential prerequisite to design efficient antiinflammatory therapies and to avoid unexpected side effects.

https://openalex.org/W1987006179,"Background Enterococcus faecalis is one of the leading agents of nosocomial infections. To cause diseases, pathogens or opportunistic bacteria have to adapt and survive to the defense systems encountered in the host. One of the most important compounds of the host innate defense response against invading microorganisms is lysozyme. It is found in a wide variety of body fluids, as well as in cells of the innate immune system. Lysozyme could act either as a muramidase and/or as a cationic antimicrobial peptide. Like Staphylococcus aureus, E. faecalis is one of the few bacteria that are completely lysozyme resistant. Results This study revealed that oatA (O-acetyl transferase) and dlt (D-Alanylation of lipoteicoic acids) genes contribute only partly to the lysozyme resistance of E. faecalis and that a specific transcriptional regulator, the extracytoplasmic function SigV sigma factor plays a key role in this event. Indeed, the sigV single mutant is as sensitive as the oatA/dltA double mutant, and the sigV/oatA/dltA triple mutant displays the highest level of lysozyme sensitivity suggesting synergistic effects of these genes. In S. aureus, mutation of both oatA and dlt genes abolishes completely the lysozyme resistance, whereas this is not the case in E. faecalis. Interestingly SigV does not control neither oatA nor dlt genes. Moreover, the sigV mutants clearly showed a reduced capacity to colonize host tissues, as they are significantly less recovered than the parental JH2-2 strain from organs of mice subjected to intravenous or urinary tract infections. Conclusions This work led to the discovery of an original model of lysozyme resistance mechanism which is obviously more complex than those described for other Gram positive pathogens. Moreover, our data provide evidences for a direct link between lysozyme resistance and virulence of E. faecalis."

These neuronal nonvoltage-gated Na+ channels are involved in learning, the expression of fear, neurodegeneration after ischemia, and pain sensation.

We first calculated the pKa value of all extracellular His, Glu, and Asp residues using a Poisson-Boltzmann continuum approach, based on the ASIC three-dimensional structure, to identify candidate pH-sensing residues. The role of these residues was then assessed by site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification, combined with functional analysis. The localization of putative pH-sensing residues suggests that pH changes control ASIC gating by protonation/deprotonation of many residues per subunit in different channel domains. Analysis of the function of residues in the palm domain close to the central vertical axis of the channel allowed for prediction of conformational changes of this region during gating.

Our study provides a basis for the intrinsic ASIC pH dependence and describes an approach that can also be applied to the investigation of the mechanisms of the pH dependence of other proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1978431886,"Partial gain of chromosome arm 17q is an abundant aberrancy in various cancer types such as lung and prostate cancer with a prominent occurrence and prognostic significance in neuroblastoma – one of the most common embryonic tumors. The specific genetic element/s in 17q responsible for the cancer-promoting effect of these aberrancies is yet to be defined although many genes located in 17q have been proposed to play a role in malignancy. We report here the characterization of a naturally-occurring, non-reciprocal translocation der(X)t(X;17) in human lung embryonal-derived cells following continuous culturing. This aberrancy was strongly correlated with an increased proliferative capacity and with an acquired ability to form colonies in vitro. The breakpoint region was mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to the 17q24.3 locus. Further characterization by a custom-made comparative genome hybridization array (CGH) localized the breakpoint within the Bromodomain PHD finger Transcription Factor gene (BPTF), a gene involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. Interestingly, this translocation led to elevation in the mRNA levels of the endogenous BPTF. Knock-down of BPTF restricted proliferation suggesting a role for BPTF in promoting cellular growth. Furthermore, the BPTF chromosomal region was found to be amplified in various human tumors, especially in neuroblastomas and lung cancers in which 55% and 27% of the samples showed gain of 17q24.3, respectively. Additionally, 42% percent of the cancer cell lines comprising the NCI-60 had an abnormal BPTF locus copy number. We suggest that deregulation of BPTF resulting from the translocation may confer the cells with the observed cancer-promoting phenotype and that our cellular model can serve to establish causality between 17q aberrations and carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2056711838,"While males usually benefit from as many matings as possible, females often evolve various methods of resistance to matings. The prevalent explanation for this is that the cost of additional matings exceeds the benefits of receiving sperm from a large number of males. Here we demonstrate, however, a strongly deviating pattern of polyandry.We analysed paternity in the marine snail Littorina saxatilis by genotyping large clutches (53-79) of offspring from four females sampled in their natural habitats. We found evidence of extreme promiscuity with 15-23 males having sired the offspring of each female within the same mating period.Such a high level of promiscuity has previously only been observed in a few species of social insects. We argue that genetic bet-hedging (as has been suggested earlier) is unlikely to explain such extreme polyandry. Instead we propose that these high levels are examples of convenience polyandry: females accept high numbers of matings if costs of refusing males are higher than costs of accepting superfluous matings."

Most previous investigations into mechanisms that regulate the rate of ribosome synthesis have focused on the initiation step of transcription by Pol I; however, recent studies in yeast and mammals have identified factors that influence transcription elongation by Pol I. The RNA polymerase-associated factor 1 complex (Paf1C) is a transcription elongation factor with known roles in Pol II transcription. We previously identified a role for Paf1C in transcription elongation by Pol I. In this study, genetic interactions between genes for Paf1C and Pol I subunits confirm this conclusion.

The synthesis of rRNA is an important rate-limiting step in ribosome assembly, which is connected to environmental stimulation, nutritional conditions, and cell growth rate (1Grummt I. Prog.

Although the essential factors that compose the Pol I transcription machinery have been characterized, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the control of Pol I activity remain largely unknown. Definitive studies in yeast and mammalian cells have shown that the transcription initiation factor Rrn3p is an important target for the control of the rRNA synthesis rate (3Claypool J.A. French S.L.

Paf1C consists of five subunits: Cdc73p, Ctr9p, Leo1p, Rtf1p, and Paf1p (8Krogan N.J. Kim M. Ahn S.H. Zhong G. Kobor M.S. Cagney G. Emili A. Shilatifard A. Buratowski S. Greenblatt J.F. Mol. Cell.

Several lines of evidence suggest that Paf1C can influence transcription initiation and elongation by Pol II. Paf1C associates with both the promoter and coding regions of actively transcribed mRNA genes (10Pokholok D.K. Hannett N.M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 799-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Defects in Paf1C function affect expression of a subset of genes transcribed by Pol II (11Porter S.E.

Cell. 2002; 1: 830-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Paf1C can regulate transcription initiation by affecting the association of the TATA-binding protein with the TATA box (13Stolinski L.A. Eisenmann D.M. Arndt K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4490-4500Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Paf1C also interacts physically and/or genetically with known transcription elongation factors (Spt4p/Spt5p and FACT) (14Qiu H. Hu C. Wong C.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3135-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Squazzo S.L. Costa P.J. Lindstrom D.L. Kumer K.E. Simic R. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Arndt K.M. Hartzog G.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1764-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Additionally, both in vivo and in vitro transcription assays show that Paf1C enhances the efficiency of transcription elongation by Pol II (11Porter S.E. Penheiter K.L. Jaehning J.A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Chen Y. Yamaguchi Y. Tsugeno Y. Yamamoto J. Yamada T. Nakamura M. Hisatake K. Handa H.

Thus, the roles for Paf1C in Pol II transcription are robust. Paf1C also influences mRNA processing and modifications of chromatin structure. Mutations in genes for Paf1C subunits affect the length of poly(A) tails on multiple mRNAs and impair the processing of small nucleolar RNAs (18Mueller C.L. Porter S.E. Hoffman M.G. Jaehning J.A.

Paf1C recruits the COMPASS methyltransferase to Pol II and is essential for the methylation of histone H3 Lys4 and Lys79 in yeast, fly, and human (20Adelman K. Wei W. Ardehali M.B. Werner J. Zhu B.

Efficient monoubiquitination of histone H2B requires Paf1C as well (23Wood A. Schneider J. Dover J. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34739-34742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). We recently identified a new role for Paf1C in transcription elongation by Pol I (7Zhang Y. Sikes M.L. Beyer A.L. Schneider D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2153-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Paf1C associates with rDNA in vivo. Deletion of the Paf1C subunit gene CDC73, CTR9, or PAF1 caused a reduced rRNA synthesis rate; however, this decrease was not due to a reduction in Pol I occupancy of the rDNA or a decline in the percentage of actively transcribed rDNA repeats. These data led us to conclude that Paf1C plays a positive role in transcription elongation by Pol I (7Zhang Y. Sikes M.L. Beyer A.L. Schneider D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2153-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because Paf1C participates in both Pol I and Pol II transcription, our previous in vivo studies could not exclude indirect effects of Paf1C on Pol I through changes in mRNA expression. In this study, we demonstrate that Paf1C directly participates in Pol I transcription elongation. Synthetic genetic interactions between mutations in genes for Paf1C subunits (ctr9Δ and paf1Δ) and a nonessential Pol I subunit (rpa49Δ) support the conclusion that Paf1C is important for transcription elongation by Pol I in vivo (7Zhang Y. Sikes M.L. Beyer A.L. Schneider D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2153-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrate that purified Paf1C directly increases the rate of transcription elongation by Pol I in vitro. Finally, Paf1C is required for efficient control of rRNA synthesis in response to rapamycin treatment or starvation for histidine (using 3-aminotriazole (3-AT)). In the absence of PAF1, Pol I occupancy of the rDNA and rRNA synthesis rates remain elevated after treatment with rapamycin compared with wild-type (WT) cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Paf1C directly enhances the rate of transcription elongation by Pol I and serves as an important regulator of rRNA synthesis. The yeast strains and plasmids used are listed in Table 1. Yeast cells were grown in either synthetic glucose (SD) medium or yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YEPD) medium at 30°C with aeration. YEPD medium consisted of 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose. S-minimal medium supplemented with glucose and essential nutrients was made according to the following recipe: 0.17% yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids or ammonium; Difco, Detroit, MI), 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% dextrose, and 0.087% nutrient mixture. The complete nutrient mixture contained 0.8 g of adenine, 0.8 g of arginine, 4 g of aspartic acid, 0.8 g of histidine, 2.4 g of leucine, 1.2 g of lysine, 0.8 g of methionine, 2 g of phenylalanine, 8 g of threonine, 0.8 g of tryptophan, 1.2 g of tyrosine, and 0.8 g of uracil.

Strains with the indicated deletions (cdc73Δ, ctr9Δ, leo1Δ, paf1Δ, and rtf1Δ) were individually mated with DAS50 (rpa49Δ). The resulting diploids were sporulated and dissected on YEPD plates. Four segregants from a single tetrad representing all four possible genotypes were grown in SD complete medium overnight and diluted to A600 = 0.1, and then 10-μl samples of serial dilutions were spotted onto SD complete medium.

The final concentration of rapamycin added to each culture was 0.2 μg/ml. 3-AT was added to a final concentration of 10 mm in medium lacking histidine. Cells expressing His7-(HA)3-tagged Paf1p (DAS317) were grown in 12 liters of YEPD medium to A600 = 0.6. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in breakage buffer (500 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm Tris acetate, 10% glycerol, 20 mm imidazole, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.9), and frozen at −80 °C. Cells were resuspended in breakage buffer and broken with glass beads in a FastPrep system (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH). Cleared lysates were incubated with 1 ml of nickel resin for 1 h in batch at 4 °C. Resin was loaded into a column and washed with 5 column volumes of breakage buffer. Proteins were eluted from the nickel resin using breakage buffer and 500 mm imidazole. This eluate was incubated with 200 μl of anti-HA affinity resin (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C with agitation. Beads were washed four times with 1 ml of breakage buffer and eluted with four successive 1-ml washes with breakage buffer and 150 μg/ml HA peptide. This eluate was washed and concentrated into storage buffer (100 mm potassium glutamate, 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.9, 8 mm magnesium acetate, and 10% glycerol) using a 50-kDa cutoff column (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Mass spectrometry was performed essentially as described previously (38Renfrow M.B. Mackay C.L. Chalmers M.J. Julian B.A. Mestecky J. Kilian M. Poulsen K. Emmett M.R. Marshall A.G. Novak J. Anal.

Individual protein bands were excised from the gel with a razor blade and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion (with reduction by 10 mm dithiothreitol and alkylation with 50 mm iodoacetamide). Tryptic digests were loaded onto a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry system composed of a Micro AS autosampler, LC nanopump (Eksigent), and a linear ion trap-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance hybrid mass spectrometer (LTQ FT-ICR, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The analytical column was a 100-μm diameter, 11-cm column pulled tip packed with Jupiter 5-μm C18 reversed-phase beads (Phenomenex). An acetonitrile gradient from 5 to 40% in 0.1% formic acid was run over 50 min at 650 nl/min. LTQ FT-ICR parameters were set as described previously(38Renfrow M.B. Mackay C.L. Chalmers M.J.

SEQUEST and MASCOT results were further refined through the transproteomic pipeline with Peptide Prophet and Protein Prophet (40Nesvizhskii A.I. Keller A. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Anal.

Transcription elongation assays were performed as described previously (25Schneider D.A. Michel A. Sikes M.L. Vu L. Dodd J.A. Salgia S. Osheim Y.N. Beyer A.L. Nomura M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 217-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), except the nucleotide triphosphate concentrations used were 100 μm ATP and UTP and 10 μm GTP (+[α-32P]GTP) for transcription initiation, followed by 100 μm CTP to clear the +56 block. The reduced NTP concentrations used account for the relatively slow elongation rates measured (see Fig. 2C). This reduction is necessary to permit accurate quantification of elongation rates in vitro. ChIP analysis was performed as described previously (7Zhang Y. Sikes M.L. Beyer A.L. Schneider D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2153-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Pol I was immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to the A190 subunit. Pol I consists of 14 subunits; however, four of these subunits (A49, A34, A14, and A12) are not essential for growth (for review, see Ref. 2Nomura M. Nogi Y. Oakes M. Olson M.O.J. The Nucleolus. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2004: 128-153Google Scholar). In vitro studies have demonstrated that A49 functions as an intrinsic transcription elongation factor for Pol I (24Kuhn C.D. Geiger S.R. Baumli S. Gartmann M. Gerber J. Jennebach S. Mielke T. Tschochner H. Beckmann R. Cramer P. Cell. 2007; 131: 1260-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Therefore, genetic interactions between rpa49Δ and mutations in genes for Paf1C subunits would support the model that Paf1C participates in Pol I transcription elongation. We mated a strain carrying a deletion of RPA49 with strains carrying deletions of genes for each of the five subunits of Paf1C. We sporulated the resulting diploid strains and scored for synthetic growth defects after tetrad dissection (Fig. 1A). To recover double mutants, we incubated the dissection plates >7 days at 30 °C. We found that only ∼30% of paf1Δ rpa49Δ double mutants produced viable spores. Similarly, only 40% of ctr9Δ rpa49Δ segregants germinated (Fig. 1A). We confirmed the synthetic growth defect of the double mutant strains by plating serial dilutions of the cells on standard medium compared with single mutant parental strains and the WT control (Fig. 1B). Growth of the double mutant strains was worse than the additive growth defects of the individual parental mutants (Fig. 1B).The simplest interpretation of this synthetic growth defect is that PAF1 and CTR9 are required for efficient Pol I transcription. In contrast, the modest growth defects in the cdc73Δ, leo1Δ, and rtf1Δ strains were not exacerbated by the absence of RPA49 (Fig. 1A). It is well known that deletion of CDC73, LEO1, or RTF1 does not lead to severe defects in growth rate, whereas deletion of PAF1 or CTR9 does. It is also clear that expression of rRNA is intimately linked to cell growth and proliferation rates. Thus, our observation that Paf1p and Ctr9p play more critical roles in Pol I transcription than the other three subunits is expected. As a control for these genetic experiments, we also mated paf1Δ and ctr9Δ strains with strains carrying deletions of RPA34 or RPA12 (genes for subunits of Pol I that do not have defined roles in transcription elongation). These mutant combinations were not synthetic lethal (data not shown). These data, together with previous observations, demonstrate that Paf1p and Ctr9p play central roles in transcription elongation by Pol I. Genetic interactions (Fig. 1) and previously reported in vivo analyses suggested (7Zhang Y. Sikes M.L. Beyer A.L. Schneider D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2153-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that Paf1C is involved in Pol I transcription elongation. However, it is difficult to differentiate direct from indirect roles for Paf1C in Pol I transcription, given its many published roles in Pol II activity and chromatin modifications. Thus, we purified Paf1C and performed in vitro transcription elongation assays to directly measure the effect of Paf1C on the rate of Pol I transcription elongation (25Schneider D.A. Michel A. Sikes M.L. Vu L. Dodd J.A. Salgia S. Osheim Y.N. Beyer A.L. Nomura M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 217-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To purify Paf1C, we used a strain expressing His7-(HA)3-tagged Paf1p. After nickel affinity chromatography and anti-HA immunoaffinity enrichment, we concentrated the protein preparation and analyzed the sample by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie Blue-stained gel bands were digested with trypsin, and all five Paf1C subunits were confirmed by high resolution mass spectrometry (Fig. 2A). No other transcription elongation factors (e.g. Spt4p/Spt5p or FACT) were detected. By inspection of the gel, we estimated that the protein preparation was at least 90% pure. We have previously developed an assay for accurate measurement of Pol I transcription elongation rate in vitro (25Schneider D.A. Michel A. Sikes M.L. Vu L. Dodd J.A. Salgia S. Osheim Y.N. Beyer A.L. Nomura M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 217-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The linear rDNA template used in this assay is identical to the chromosomal rDNA promoter region and 5′-external transcribed spacer except that all C residues (in the nontemplate strand) in the first 56 positions of the 5′-external transcribed spacer are mutated to G. To perform the assay, we incubated purified Pol I and required transcription factors (upstream activation factor, TATA-binding protein, core factor, and Rrn3p) with the rDNA template to pre-form transcription initiation complexes. Then, purified Paf1C (or storage buffer as a negative control) was added to the transcription reactions. Transcription was initiated with a mixture of three NTPs (ATP, GTP, UTP, [α-32P]GTP). As a result, transcription elongation complexes were synchronized at +56 (the position of the first C in the nontemplate strand, numbered relative to the transcription start site). Heparin was added to reactions to disrupt remaining preinitiation complexes and to prevent reinitiation. Thus, we assayed only a single round of transcription. Finally, CTP was added to the master reactions, and samples were collected as a function of time. The resulting products were analyzed by phosphorimaging after electrophoresis (Fig. 2B). Qualitative analysis revealed that maximum runoff product accumulated faster in the presence of Paf1C than in its absence (Fig. 2B, asterisks in expanded views of the product). To quantify the data, we generated a regression from the amount of runoff products versus time (Fig. 2C). The data were fit to a sigmoidal curve as expected for runoff product accumulation, and from these plots, we estimated that the Pol I transcription rate in the presence of Paf1C was 1.75-fold higher than in the control reaction. Although this difference is relatively small, it was highly reproducible under variable buffer conditions and using independent preparations of Paf1C. In each experiment, the absolute elongation rate calculated varied for +buffer and +Paf1C reactions (due to small variation in temperature or intentional changes in NTP concentration). However, when we normalized the +Paf1C elongation rate to the +buffer control rate, we observed a reproducible 1.75-fold induction of the elongation rate by Paf1C (Fig. 2D). The magnitude of activation observed here is comparable with data published recently using the transcription elongation factor NusG in the presence of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (26Mooney R.A. Schweimer K. Rösch P. Gottesman M. Landick R. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 391: 341-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Because in vitro and in vivo conditions cannot be compared directly, it is not surprising that the magnitude of activation observed here is different from the ∼3-fold effect calculated previously (7Zhang Y. Sikes M.L. Beyer A.L. Schneider D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2153-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that Paf1C can directly enhance Pol I transcription elongation in the absence of accessory elongation factors or chromatin. The above data indicated that Paf1C plays an important positive role in Pol I transcription elongation. Previous reports have suggested that regulation of Pol I loading on rDNA does not fully explain the magnitude of regulation of rRNA synthesis observed after various growth challenges (3Claypool J.A. French S.L. Johzuka K. Eliason K. Vu L. Dodd J.A. Beyer A.L. Nomura M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 946-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 27Tongaonkar P. French S.L. Oakes M.L. Vu L. Schneider D.A. Beyer A.L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 10129-10134Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether Paf1C may play a role in regulation of rRNA synthesis in response to nutrient limitation. Because TOR is a central nutrient signaling pathway in eukaryotes (28Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4745) Google Scholar), we measured Pol I transcription activity after inhibition of TOR signaling using rapamycin in WT and paf1Δ cells. Initially, we conducted [3H]uridine incorporation assays to determine total RNA synthesis rates. Because most RNA synthesis is derived from Pol I in exponentially growing cells, this is a useful method to approximate Pol I transcription. WT cells were sensitive to rapamycin treatment; the total RNA synthesis rate decreased by >90% over the 40-min time course (Fig. 3A). In contrast, [3H]uridine incorporation decreased by only ∼60% during the length of rapamycin treatment in the paf1Δ strain. These data suggest that Paf1p is required for efficient control of rRNA synthesis in response to nutrient conditions. The paf1Δ strain grows ∼3-fold slower than WT cells (7Zhang Y. Sikes M.L. Beyer A.L. Schneider D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2153-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To rule out the effect of slow growth rate on the responsiveness of Pol I transcription to rapamycin, we included the WT strain grown in medium with 1.8% ethanol as the sole carbon source instead of glucose. Under these conditions, the WT strain grew at approximately the same rate as the paf1Δ strain, and the Pol I transcription rate was similarly reduced. However, unlike in the paf1Δ strain, Pol I transcription remained responsive to rapamycin treatment in WT cells grown in ethanol (Fig. 3A). Thus, the altered sensitivity to rapamycin in the paf1Δ strain is not simply a consequence of decreased growth rate. To specifically measure changes in the Pol I transcription rate, we pulse-labeled WT and paf1Δ cells using [3H]methylmethionine in the absence of rapamycin and after a 40-min treatment. Because rRNA is cotranscriptionally methylated in yeast, this method permits accurate quantification of Pol I transcription rates in vivo using short pulse times (29Warner J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). After chasing with unlabeled methionine, RNA was isolated, and [3H]methylmethionine incorporation into 25 S and 18 S rRNAs was visualized by autoradiography. In the absence of rapamycin, we observed a reduction in the Pol I transcription rate in the paf1Δ mutant compared with WT cells (Fig. 3B). This observation is consistent with our published observations (7Zhang Y. Sikes M.L. Beyer A.L. Schneider D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2153-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). After treatment with rapamycin, Pol I transcription was below our level of detection in WT strains; however, the Pol I transcription rate in the paf1Δ strain was clearly detectable above background levels especially after 7 days of exposure (Fig. 3B). These data confirm that Paf1C function is required for the efficient response of Pol I transcription to the inhibition of TOR signaling. We also observed defects in rRNA processing in the paf1Δ mutant in the presence of rapamycin. There was a significant accumulation of 27 S and 23 S rRNAs (Fig. 3B) even after the 5-min chase with unlabeled methionine. Previous studies demonstrated that without rapamycin treatment, the paf1Δ mutant exhibits modest rRNA-processing defects (7Zhang Y. Sikes M.L. Beyer A.L. Schneider D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

IntroductionAllostery is important in controlled catalysis, signal transduction, and apoptosis (1Gunasekaran K. Ma B. Nussinov R. Proteins. 2004; 57: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The classic view of proteins demonstrating this property (2Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6083) Google Scholar) asserts that binding of a ligand at one site provokes conformational changes at a remote, second site. Recent studies (3Kern D. Zuiderweg E.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 748-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) evaluating underlying mechanisms of allostery alternatively suggest that ligand binding results in selection of preexisting conformational substates. Implicit in the latter model is the principle that interactions between the orthosteric and allosteric sites are tightly linked through structure and thermodynamics (4Cooper A. Dryden D.T. Eur. Biophys. J. 1984; 11: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Active challenges in structural biology, which are central to this work, are deciphering the chemical nature of the ligand-protein interactions as well as how energy is transduced through protein structures to transmit allosteric events.Our experimental model, the human Kinesin-5 motor protein (Eg5 or KSP), plays key roles in bipolar mitotic spindle formation and is a protein target for allosteric compounds (5Hotha S.

Additionally, these compounds serve as research tools to probe the fundamental mechanism by which Eg5 and perhaps all motor proteins convert and transduce energy to conformational changes in distal regions of the protein. Insights concerning allosteric conformational states of Eg5 result principally from diffraction- and microscopy-based techniques. The Eg5 motor domain is an arrowhead-shaped structure with a central β-sheet flanked by three helices on each side. In crystallographic studies of Eg5·ADP complexed with monastrol (17Maliga Z.

Commun. 2008; 372: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the wild type Kinesin-5 motor domain adopts a similar conformer, irrespective of the chemical nature of the allosteric drug. This suggests a single mode of allosteric communication, a conclusion that conflicts with the body of kinetic data.The most notable conformational change observed is the adoption of a “closed” conformation by the insertion loop (L5) within the α2 helix that cradles the allosteric compound. This is in contrast with the “open” conformation observed in the absence (24Turner J. Anderson R. Guo J. Beraud C. Fletterick R. Sakowicz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25496-25502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) of an allosteric ligand. However, conformational transitions of the L5 loop are found not only in response to drug binding but also in normal motor function. The Eg5 conformer trapped by allosteric agents is proposed to be an intermediate state of its normal ATP hydrolysis cycle (25Cochran J.C. Gilbert S.P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16633-16648Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The L5 loop is observed in the closed conformation in cryo-electron microscopy experiments with a Drosophila melanogaster homologue of Eg5 bound to microtubules using non-hydrolyzable substrate analogues (26Bodey A.J. Kikkawa M. Moores C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 388: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and in Eg5·AMPPNP crystals in the absence of allosteric agents (27Parke C.L. Wojcik E.J. Kim S. Worthylake D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5859-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These data suggest that surface loops in the motor domain are indispensable for controlling catalysis in native kinesins.No consensus of L5 residues key for transmitting allosteric information has been established, primarily due to interdependence of the allosteric and active-site interactions and the lack of rapid methods to observe structures of mutant motor proteins. Simple sequence conservation analysis (Fig. 1A) does not reveal how the L5 loop specifically recognizes and binds an allosteric molecule. Studies (15Lad L. Luo L. Carson J.D. Wood K.W. Hartman J.J.

However, neither these reports nor x-ray structural analyses of allosterically inhibited Eg5 proteins arrive at a common set of contact residues required for the inhibition by different chemical partners.This work focuses on the unaddressed question of why there are differing efficacies in drug inhibition of Eg5. Our hypothesis is that there is more than one pathway for allosteric communication that initiates from the L5 loop of Eg5; differences in the inhibitory power of monastrol and STC among the Kinesin-5 orthologues result from these deviations in allosteric communication. We demonstrate an integrated approach to build, test, and refine a model of how allostery is propagated from the surface L5 loop through the Eg5 kinesin motor domain in solution. We do so by measuring not only biochemical behavior of mutant proteins but also protein secondary structure in solution. Unique to this work is a systems approach to examine multivariate data representing protein structure in bulk solution; such discovery methods can organize and uncover patterns at the atomic level in the spectroscopic data. These global and integrated analyses can provide new hypotheses; the resulting model reveals that allosteric conformational changes at the protein surface can promote two different types of intraprotein contacts at the central core of the kinesin motor domain. These changes discriminate between the inhibitory power of allosteric drugs.DISCUSSIONImportant questions in protein biochemistry are whether and how conformational flexibility is linked to catalytic function. Although the atomic level detail of the 20 PDB entries for wild type Eg5 is fairly complete, whether these static “snapshots” accurately reflect functional states that these amino acid assemblies can achieve is more difficult to determine. Thus, obtaining all needed conformational possibilities in kinesin mechanotransduction and its allosteric inhibition is a significant challenge.Herein we provide novel approaches to query the conformational component in the term “structure-function relationship” and to apply computational analysis when intuitive reasoning becomes insufficient. We used wild type protein and 15 different mutants in three different protein conditions: drug-free, monastrol-bound, and STC-bound. The resulting 48 different structural analyses exceeds the current number of Eg5 structures in the RCSB from nearly a decade of work. This large data set of Eg5 solution structures permits fresh appreciation of structural linkages and also allows quantification of the relationships.Our multivariate analysis of these structural measurements yields a model, in which there is more than one linked outcome between conformational changes from the surface L5 loop to the β-sheet core of the motor domain. Questions we have addressed are (i) the prediction accuracy between vibrational spectroscopy and protein crystallography, (ii) the unique detection of force coupled with chemistry (or mechanochemistry) by IR measurements, (iii) whether the solution structures sampled via inhibitors and mutation reflect preexisting conformational states in native protein, and (iv) how novel use of IR spectroscopy and PCA can be applied to clinical practice.There Is High Prediction Accuracy between IR and X-ray Diffraction Determination of Eg5 Helical StructuresForemost in this novel application of IR spectroscopy is the question of where these techniques intersect and where they diverge. Current IR data do not inherently contain information on the precise site(s) of origin within the Eg5 motor domain. Inspection of relevant crystal structures can facilitate the further assignment of an IR signature to a specific protein segment. Attempts at mutant protein crystallography, despite prior success in our hands (27Parke C.L. Wojcik E.J. Kim S. Worthylake D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5859-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), did not garner L5 mutant protein crystals that diffract well (data not shown).However, examination of fractional secondary structure content of wild type Eg5 motor proteins determined from existing x-ray structures supports our multivariate findings of Kinesin-5 in solution. From DSSP analysis (47Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12098) Google Scholar) of Eg5 structures in the PDB, increased 310 helix content is observed when comparing ligand-bound versus drug-free Eg5 proteins (Table 2). In the Eg5·ADP crystal structure (24Turner J. Anderson R. Guo J. Beraud C. Fletterick R. Sakowicz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25496-25502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), four 310 helices are found within the α3, α5, and α6 helices and in the switch I loop, each of which is 3 residues long. Thus, 3.3% of residues in the Eg5 motor domain are found in 310 helices in the inhibitor-free crystal structures. In inhibitor-complexed Eg5 proteins, there is generally a gain of two 310 helices in the L5 loop; as 6 residues undergo a random coil-310 helix transition, the fractional content of 310 helices increases to 4.9%.TABLE 2Comparison of fractional secondary structure composition in inhibitor-free and inhibitor-bound crystal structures of Eg5Compared structuresPercentage change in secondary structureβ-Sheetα helix310 helixTurnBendβ bridge%%%%%%(STC) 3KEN versus 1II6−0.71.50.0−1.50.80.0(monastrol) 1Q0B versus 1II63.0−1.41.60.3−0.70.0(monastrol) 1X88 versus 1II62.3−1.51.60.9−1.60.01YRS versus 1II60.0−2.41.21.20.9−0.32IEH versus 1II62.7−2.60.02.40.7−0.3Secondary structure assignments in crystallographic data are obtained from DSSP analysis. Fractional compositions were calculated for each protein within the asymmetric unit cell and averaged, when appropriate. Subtraction values of inhibitor-bound from inhibitor-free Eg5 (1II6) structures are shown. Open table in a new tab Although the IR absorbance spectrum is a reflection of the motor protein ensemble, we surmise that the above IR-detectable changes at 1642 and 1646 cm−1 are localized to the L5 loop because it is the only protein segment that shows a conformational isomerization between 310 helices and a random loop in the crystal structures. Moreover, this stringent comparison between our solution structural determinations and crystallographic data calls attention to the sensitivity of the vibrational methods employed here; even changes in 6 residues can be accurately detected within the amide I′ envelope.IR Spectroscopy Is Uniquely Suited to Measure Mechanochemical Changes in Motor ProteinsDespite the initial similarities, the experimental distinction between the two biophysical methods becomes evident in their respective examination of Eg5 β-sheet structures. Protein crystallography defines the spatial organization of 90–100 Eg5 residues (or 24–27% of the motor domain) into β-strands or sheets, based on distance and dihedral angle guidelines. In contrast, infrared frequencies are a direct function of the force constants of the vibrating bonds and of the reduced mass of a chemical group. They are therefore correlated to a number of other physicochemical parameters, such as bond length and strength, and as such are reporters of not only group structure but also the environment surrounding the functional group.From the arguments above, we highlight here that IR spectroscopy can provide a direct measure of mechanochemical coupling in motor proteins. Likewise, comparison of infrared and crystallographic analysis may reveal parallels between them but need not always show complete accord. Examination of Eg5 crystallographic data shows that L5-directed inhibitors can increase β-sheet content by 3% of the total residues, decrease β-sheet content by 0.7%, or yield no change (Table 2) in comparison with Eg5·ADP complexes (24Turner J. Anderson R. Guo J. Beraud C. Fletterick R. Sakowicz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25496-25502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In contrast, we observe changes in two frequencies associated with β-sheet carbonyls in our IR analysis of Eg5 proteins that are biochemically or molecularly perturbed at the allosteric site. Measurement of the 1633 and 1628 cm−1 modes showed there is 5–10% change in β-sheet carbonyls in all Eg5 conditions sampled (wild-type and mutants in drug-free, monastrol-, or STC-bound states). Although there is reasonable qualitative agreement, discernment of two different types of β-sheet perturbations and the quantitative difference show that there is no simple one-to-one correspondence between the biophysical measurements.There are several potential biochemical causes for observing two differing infrared frequencies for β-sheet carbonyls in these analyses. According to the simple two-atomic oscillator model, factors affecting the force constant between the atoms and/or the reduced mass of the chemical group will alter the C=O stretching frequency in the amide I′ region. Changes in strength or length of the hydrogen bonds (48Krimm S. Bandekar J. Anfinsen C.B. Edsall J.T. Richards F.M. Advances in Protein Chemistry. Academic Press, Inc., New York1986: 181-364Google Scholar) alter the C=O stretching frequency: distinctions in hydrogen bonding patterns between β-sheets, such as those between parallel and antiparallel β-strands, are detectable by IR spectroscopy. Differences in the exposure of β-sheet structures to the aqueous environment or to other structural elements within the motor domain can also be monitored via infrared frequencies.It is also equally probable that, because bond energy and length are directly related, bond distortions can be monitored with accuracy (48Krimm S. Bandekar J. Anfinsen C.B. Edsall J.T. Richards F.M. Advances in Protein Chemistry. Academic Press, Inc., New York1986: 181-364Google Scholar). The force constant can report strain arising via distortions of secondary structure. From our data, we conclude that monastrol inhibition produces a distortion of the central β-sheet structure and/or hydrogen-bonding pattern between β-strands that differs from STC. When the more potent inhibitor (STC) is bound to Eg5, the β6 and β7 strands pull toward the face of the motor domain containing the MT-binding site, whereas binding of monastrol results in these β-strands pulling into the L5 face. Thus, crystallographic data on wild type Kinesin-5 corroborate our assertion that IR spectroscopy can directly measure mechanochemical coupling in motor proteins.Reports that describe these structures typically conclude that observed alterations in the β-strands are artifacts due to crystal packing in the lattice (e.g. see Ref. 23Zhang B. Liu J.F. Xu Y. Ng S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 372: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Alternatively, computational analysis of empirical experimental observations can uniquely draw mechanistic inferences of how biochemical systems function without bias, such as in the well developed area of enzyme kinetics. In this work, only from PCA analysis of the IR frequencies could we capture the dominant modes of motion within Eg5 during allostery. These results compel unique conclusions in the fundamental understanding of ATPase mechanisms and in novel biomedical applications.Distortions in β-Sheets Are a Conserved Means of Mechanochemical Communication in Eg5 Kinesin, Myosin, and F1-ATPasesIn our model of Eg5 allostery, distortions in secondary structures are a means of communication across the motor domain and may comprise a portion of the force component in kinesin mechanotransduction. Our data show that 310 helices in the L5 loop and β-strands in the central sheet undergo mechanochemical changes upon drug binding or sequence mutation. We do not anticipate that Eg5 undergoes unitary conformational transitions, in which the whole protein changes its structure simultaneously, but rather that there are probably stepwise or hierarchical changes across the L5 loop and the β-sheet.At the local allosteric site, the 310 helices within the L5 loop and the α2 helix, encapsulating the loop, can impose torque on the L5 structure. The stored potential energy resulting from this stress and strain allows for the springlike motion of the L5 loop to enclose a small molecule inhibitor within the allosteric pocket. We speculate that observed reduction of 310 helix content results in diminished strain, decreased energy, and loss of L5 rigidity, thereby significantly reducing drug sensitivity in Eg5 mutants.Intramolecular interactions between the hydrogen-bonding edges of β-strands can constitute a fundamental form of force propagation in Eg5. Twisting or distortion of the central β-sheet may propagate changes of the protein structure that result in lower steady-state, basal ATPase rates in general. The β6 and β7 strands immediately follow and precede switch I and switch II, respectively. This suggests a mechanism by which the allosteric compounds can impact ATP hydrolysis. These switch regions are critical in the binding of the nucleophilic water and catalytic base (27Parke C.L. Wojcik E.J. Kim S. Worthylake D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5859-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Large conformational modification of the switch regions will directly affect catalytic rates. In addition, there is a deformation of the microtubule-binding site observable in Kinesin-5 crystal structures with a bound allosteric molecule (data not shown), suggesting a rationale for the observed interruption of cytoskeletal interactions (49Crevel I.M. Alonso M.C. Cross R.A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R411-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).This model offers an alternate hypothesis from commonly adopted views that spatial translation of loops, such as the L5 loop and the neck linker, influence the organization of residues involved in productive chemical transformations and movement. However, there is a growing recognition of the importance of intramolecular interactions among β-strands. Such twisting-shearing motions in the central β-sheet have been reported for the allosteric integrin I domains (50Jin M. Song G. Carman C.V. Kim Y.S. Astrof N.S. Shimaoka M. Wittrup D.K. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5758-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Reorganization of the contacts within the central β-sheet has also been observed in cryo-electron microscopy studies of Kar3 (51Hirose K. Akimaru E. Akiba T. Endow S.A. Amos L.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and in crystal structures of nucleotide-free myosins (52Coureux P.D. Wells A.L. Ménétrey J. Yengo C.M.

Biol. 2003; 10: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Despite considerable evolutionary divergence, there is apparent conservation of structural requirements in mechanotransduction across motor proteins and F1-ATPase. For myosin, the Sweeney and Houdusse laboratories (54Coureux P.D. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4527-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) also have proposed that the myosin β-sheet is a mechanochemical “transducer”; distortions of this structural element control communication between the cytoskeletal interface and the nucleotide-binding site. Second, they speculate that there must be some form of communication from a surface loop in myosin, analogous to the kinesin L5 loop, to the central β-sheet.Our data demonstrate that β-sheet distortions in Kinesin-5 resemble states of myosin that have been crystallized, and they also show the full range of distortions observed in F1-ATPase (55Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G. Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Thus, three classes of ATPase proteins have maintained similar structural elements and similar means of allosteric communication. In keeping with the original proposal in Ref. 55Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G. Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar and echoed in Ref. 54Coureux P.D. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4527-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, we speculate that distortion of β-sheets is responsible for sequential product release from the orthosteric site during force generation. This idea is experimentally supported by real-time observation of conformational changes during Eg5 catalysis in solution (56Jun B. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 11073-11077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Moreover, we provide the first experimental proof that there is direct coupling of the conformational transitions in the L5 loop with the kinesin β-sheet transducer.In summary, these above studies suggest that small changes in backbone conformation may be responsible for allosteric effects and may reflect events in"
https://openalex.org/W2013653575,"Maternal antibodies are believed to play an integral role in protecting immunologically immature wild-passerines from environmental antigens. This study comprehensively examines the early development of the adaptive immune system in an altricial-developing wild passerine species, the house sparrow (Passer domestics), by characterizing the half-life of maternal antibodies in nestling plasma, the onset of de novo synthesis of endogenous antibodies by nestlings, and the timing of immunological independence, where nestlings rely entirely on their own antibodies for immunologic protection.In an aviary study we vaccinated females against a novel antigen that these birds would not otherwise encounter in their natural environment, and measured both antigen-specific and total antibody concentration in the plasma of females, yolks, and nestlings. We traced the transfer of maternal antibodies from females to nestlings through the yolk and measured catabolisation of maternal antigen-specific antibodies in nestlings during early development. By utilizing measurements of non-specific and specific antibody levels in nestling plasma we were able to calculate the half-life of maternal antibodies in nestling plasma and the time point at which nestling were capable of synthesizing antibodies themselves. Based on the short half-life of maternal antibodies, the rapid production of endogenous antibodies by nestlings and the relatively low transfer of maternal antibodies to nestlings, our findings suggest that altricial-developing sparrows achieve immunologic independence much earlier than precocial birds.To our knowledge, this is the first in depth analyses performed on the adaptive immune system of a wild-passerine species. Our results suggest that maternal antibodies may not confer the immunologic protection or immune priming previously proposed in other passerine studies. Further research needs to be conducted on other altricial passerines to determine if the results of our study are a species-specific phenomenon or if they apply to all altricial-developing birds."
https://openalex.org/W2113545765,"Background Solid tumors, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), arise as a result of genetic and epigenetic alterations in a sustained stress environment. Little work has been done that simultaneously examines the spectrum of both types of changes in human tumors on a genome-wide scale and results so far have been limited and mixed. Since it has been hypothesized that epigenetic alterations may act by providing the second carcinogenic hit in gene silencing, we sought to identify genome-wide DNA copy number alterations and CpG dinucleotide methylation events and examine the global/local relationships between these types of alterations in HNSCC. Methodology/Principal Findings We have extended a prior analysis of 1,413 cancer-associated loci for epigenetic changes in HNSCC by integrating DNA copy number alterations, measured at 500,000 polymorphic loci, in a case series of 19 primary HNSCC tumors. We have previously demonstrated that local copy number does not bias methylation measurements in this array platform. Importantly, we found that the global pattern of copy number alterations in these tumors was significantly associated with tumor methylation profiles (p<0.002). However at the local level, gene promoter regions did not exhibit a correlation between copy number and methylation (lowest q = 0.3), and the spectrum of genes affected by each type of alteration was unique. Conclusion/Significance This work, using a novel and robust statistical approach demonstrates that, although a “second hit” mechanism is not likely the predominant mode of action for epigenetic dysregulation in cancer, the patterns of methylation events are associated with the patterns of allele loss. Our work further highlights the utility of integrative genomics approaches in exploring the driving somatic alterations in solid tumors."

In endothelial cells, activation of Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2) stimulates NO. Akt1 activates NOS3 by direct phosphorylation. We hypothesized that Ang II stimulates TAL NO production via AT2-mediated Akt1 activation, which phosphorylates NOS3 at serine 1177. We measured NO production by fluorescence microscopy. In isolated TALs, Ang II (100 nm) increased NO production by 1.1 ± 0.2 fluorescence units/min (p < 0.01). Ang II increased cGMP accumulation by 4.9 ± 1.3 fmol/μg (p < 0.01). Upon adding the AT2 antagonist PD123319 (1 μm), Ang II failed to stimulate NO (0.1 ± 0.1 fluorescence units/min; p < 0.001 versus Ang II); adding the AT1 antagonist losartan (1 μm) resulted in Ang II stimulating NO by 0.9 ± 0.1 fluorescence units/min.

It reabsorbs ∼30% of filtered NaCl and generates the osmotic gradient necessary for water reabsorption by the collecting duct. Enhanced Na+ reabsorption by this segment has been implicated in the development of hypertension (1Roman R.J. Kaldunski M.L.

The TAL cells produce NO. Endogenously produced NO inhibits Na+ reabsorption by the TAL (3Plato C.F. Stoos B.A. Wang D. Garvin J.L. Am. J.

Inappropriate NO bioavailability can lead to enhanced TAL Na+ reabsorption, Na+ retention, and hypertension. Thus, understanding the signaling cascade leading to NO production by TALs could help understand the pathophysiology of hypertension and identify new targets for its treatment. In the TAL, NO is stimulated by a number of factors including angiotensin II (Ang II) (5Dickhout J.G. Mori T. Cowley Jr., A.W. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Ang II can activate two different receptors: type 1 (AT1) or type 2 (AT2). In the vasculature, activation of AT1 leads to vasoconstriction, resulting in increased renal vascular resistance (6Kost Jr., C.K. Jackson E.K. Hypertension. 1993; 21: 420-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast, activation of AT2 in endothelial cells stimulates NO release (7Batenburg W.W. Garrelds I.M. Bernasconi C.C.

Similarly, in the kidney, activation of AT1 mediates the salt-retaining and prohypertensive actions of Ang II (8Cervenka L. Wang C.T. Navar L.G. Am. J.

Invest. 1997; 100: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 14Padia S.H. Howell N.L. Siragy H.M. Carey R.M. Hypertension. 2006; 47: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the receptor that mediates the stimulatory actions of Ang II on NO production by the TAL has not yet been identified. In the TAL, NO is produced by nitric-oxide synthase 3 (NOS3 or eNOS) (15Plato C.F. Shesely E.G. Garvin J.L. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 319-323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Herrera M. Hong N.J.

NOS3 can be activated by several signaling pathways, including those involving Ca2+/calmodulin (17Schmidt H.H. Pollock J.S. Nakane M. Förstermann U. Murad F. Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and Akt-dependent phosphorylation of NOS3 (18Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F.

We hypothesized that Ang II stimulates TAL NO production via activation of AT2 and Akt1, phosphorylating NOS3 at serine 1177 and enhancing NO production. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Kalamazoo, MI), were fed a diet containing 0.22% Na+ and 1.1% K+ (Purina, Richmond, IN) for at least 7 days. On the day of the experiment, animals were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally) and xylazine (20 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally). All protocols were carried out in accord with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. TALs were isolated from rats weighing 100–135 g and held between glass pipettes at 4 °C in a chamber designed for live cell imaging on the stage of an inverted microscope (Eclipse TE-2000-U, Nikon) as done routinely in our laboratory (29Garvin J.L. Burg M.B. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F57-F65PubMed Google Scholar). The bath was started at 0.6 ml/min, and the chamber was warmed to 37.0 ± 0.5 °C. TALs were bathed for 15 min in a solution containing: 130 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm NaH2PO4, 4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 6 mm alanine, 1 mm Na3 citrate, 5.5 mm glucose, 2 mm Ca2+ (lactate)2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) (solution A) containing 5 μm 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate (EMD Biosciences, Gibbstown, NJ) and washed for 25 min with solution A containing 50 μm l-arginine, the substrate for NOS. At this concentration, l-arginine supports but does not stimulate NO production (30Ortiz P.A. Garvin J.L. Hypertension. 2002; 39: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). TALs were imaged using a 100× oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture, 1.3), and the dye was excited with an argon laser at 488 nm. The fluorescence emitted by NO-bound dye (>500 nm) was measured using a laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with data acquisition and analysis software (VisiTech International). Measurements were recorded once every 30 s for a 5-min control period, and then either 100 nm Ang II (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) or vehicle (0.005% acetic acid) was added to the bath. Fluorescence was measured once every 30 s during the 15-min experimental period. For experiments testing the effect of Akt inhibitor VIII (EMD Biosciences, 5 μm), the AT1 antagonist losartan (Merck, Rahway, NJ; 1 μm) or the AT2 antagonist PD123319 (Parke-Davis, Ann Arbor, MI; 1 μm), the drug was added to the bath during the last 5 min of the washing period and maintained in all solutions throughout the experiment. Measurements were performed in the absence of luminal flow because we have found that flow stimulates NO production by the TAL (27Ortiz P.A. Hong N.J. Garvin J.L. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 287: F281-F288Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Rates of NO production were calculated as the slope of the initial rate of increase in 4,5-diaminofluorescein fluorescence after adding Ang II (or vehicle) minus the slope during the control period. Data are expressed as fluorescence units/min. TAL suspensions were obtained from rats weighing 150–220 g as described previously (31Herrera M. Garvin J.L. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2005; 288: F58-F64Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This procedure yields a 92% pure suspension of TALs (32Herrera M. Garvin J.L. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 287: F231-F235Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), so that contamination by other types of cells in our preparation (if any) was minimal. Total protein content was measured using Coomassie Plus reagent (Pierce), based on Bradford's colorimetric method. TAL suspensions were divided into two 2-ml centrifuge tubes and resuspended in 1 ml solution A containing 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) with vehicle (0.005% acetic acid), 100 nm Ang II or 200 μm spermine NONOate (Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI). TALs were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, gassing with 100% oxygen and inverting every 5 min. Reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml ice-cold solution A plus 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and leaving tubes on ice for 5 min. After centrifugation, 100 μl of solution A plus 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine was added to the TALs following addition of 100 μl ice-cold methanol. Tubes were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and supernatants were dried overnight by centrifugation under high vacuum. The pellets were used to measure total protein content. cGMP was measured by using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The lower limit of detectability for this assay is 0.21 pmol/sample. Results are expressed as fmol cGMP/μg protein. TAL suspensions were divided into four 2-ml centrifuge tubes and incubated for 15 min in 500 μl of solution A containing 50 μm l-arginine at 37 °C. Next, 500 μl of solution A containing either vehicle, Ang II, or the AT2 agonist CGP-42112A (Sigma) was added to each tube. Final concentrations were as follows: tube 1: 0.005% acetic acid (vehicle) and tubes 2, 3, and 4: 100 nm Ang II. Tubes were incubated at 37 °C and gassed with 100% oxygen every 5 min. After incubation for either 5 (tubes 1 and 2), 10 (tube 3), or 15 min (tube 4), suspensions were cooled by adding 1 ml of ice-cold solution A to each tube. Control experiments showed that phosphorylation of Akt and NOS3 did not change with incubation time (vehicle tubes). When studying the effect of the AT2 agonist CGP-42112A (Sigma), it was used at the final concentration of 10 nm for 10 min. When studying the effect of Akt or PI3K inhibition, the same procedure was followed, except we added the Akt inhibitor VIII (5 μm) or wortmannin (150 nm, Sigma) 5 min prior addition of either Ang II or CPG-42112A. TALs were centrifuged and lysed by vortexing them in 100 μl of a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 300 mm sucrose, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.105 m 4(2-aminoethyl)-benzene sulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). A 1:100 dilution of phosphatase inhibitor mixture II (EMD Biosciences) was added to the buffer prior to use. Samples were centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and protein content in the supernatant was measured. For total NOS3 and phosphorylated proteins, 5 and 50 μg of total protein, respectively, were loaded into each lane of an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, separated by electrophoresis, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was incubated in blocking buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 5% nonfat dried milk, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 60 min and then with a 1:1000 dilution of a NOS3-specific monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), a 1:1000 dilution of a monoclonal antibody against NOS3 phosphorylated at serine 1177 (BD Transduction Laboratories), or a 1:500 dilution of a polyclonal antibody against NOS3 phosphorylated at serine 633 (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature. For phosphorylated Akt, the process was similar except for the following. 1) a 1:2000 dilution of a polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used for 1 h at room temperature to detect Akt1 phosphorylated at serine 473. 2) A 1:500 dilution of a polyclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) was used overnight at 4 °C to detect phosphorylated Akt2 at serine 474. And 3) a 1:500 dilution of a polyclonal antibody (Abcam) was used for 1 h at room temperature to detect Akt3 phosphorylation at serine 472. The membrane was washed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of a secondary antibody against the appropriate IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction products were detected using a chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) and by exposure to Fuji RX film. Bands were quantified by densitometry. Total NOS3 was used as a loading control. When necessary, membranes were stripped and reprobed for total NOS3. Changes in phosphorylation (% from vehicle) were normalized to total NOS3. Data are expressed as the ratio phosphorylated protein/total NOS3 in arbitrary units (a.u.). Only freshly isolated TALs from a single rat were used in each experiment. n indicates the number of rats used for each data set. The dominant negative Akt1 (dn-Akt1) plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Kenneth Walsh at Boston University School of Medicine. The dominant negative is a mutant form of Akt1 (T308A, S473A) that cannot be activated by phosphorylation (33Luo Z. Fujio Y. Kureishi Y. Rudic R.D. Daumerie G. Fulton D. Sessa W.C. Walsh K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). dn-Akt1 was subcloned into a shuttle vector containing the CMV promoter. A scrambled DNA (control) was subcloned into a shuttle vector containing the H1 mouse RNA polymerase promoter. Plasmids were sent to ViraQuest (North Liberty, IA) for viral production. TALs were transduced in vivo with recombinant replication-deficient adenoviruses expressing 1) dn-Akt1 or 2) a scrambled DNA sequence as we reported previously (34Ortiz P.A. Hong N.J. Wang D. Garvin J.L. Hypertension. 2003; 42: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, the left kidney of a 95–105 g rat was exposed via a flank incision, and the renal artery and vein were clamped. Four 20-μl virus injections (1 × 1012 particles/ml) were made along the longitudinal axis at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The renal vessels were unclamped; the kidney was returned to the abdominal cavity, the muscle incision was sutured, and the skin was clipped. We previously found that maximum expression occurred 3–5 days after injection of the adenovirus (16Herrera M. Hong N.J. Ortiz P.A. Garvin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1454-1460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, all experiments were performed within these time points. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. All statistical analyses were performed by the Biostatistics Department at Henry Ford Hospital. Data were analyzed by t tests with corrections for multiple testing (Hochberg's method) when appropriate. p < 0.05 was considered significant for single comparisons. For multiple testing, the ordered p values were < 0.0167, 0.0250, and 0.0500. We first measured changes in DAF2 fluorescence to investigate whether Ang II increases NO. In isolated rat TALs, 100 nm Ang II increased NO production by 1.1 ± 0.2 fluorescence units/min, whereas vehicle (0.005% acetic acid) had no effect (0.1 ± 0.1 fluorescence units/min) (p < 0.004; n = 5; Fig. 1). The increase in NO production normally reached a plateau ∼12 min after adding Ang II. In the absence of Ang II, there was no change in emitted fluorescence, ruling out photobleaching of the dye. These data indicate that Ang II acutely stimulates NO production in isolated rat TALs. Next, we investigated the effect of Ang II on cGMP accumulation by TALs. In TAL suspensions incubated with vehicle, cGMP levels were undetectable. The calculated limit of detectability of the assay, when normalizing by the amount of protein used, is <0.8 ± 0.1 fmoles/μg. After 15 min with 100 nm Ang II, cGMP increased to 4.9 ± 1.3 fmol/μg (p < 0.01; n = 6). In addition, 15 min with the NO donor spermine NONOate increased cGMP content by 10.2 ± 2.6 fmol/μg (p < 0.02, n = 6). These data suggest that Ang II stimulates cGMP generation in the TAL and that this stimulation is about half of that produced by an NO donor. We next studied which receptor mediates the stimulatory effect of Ang II on NO production. In isolated TALs, 100 nm Ang II stimulated NO production by 0.9 ± 0.1 fluorescence units/min (p < 0.001; n = 5). When we added the AT2 antagonist PD123319 (1 μm), the ability of Ang II to stimulate NO production was abolished (0.1 ± 0.1 fluorescence units/min; p < 0.001 versus Ang II alone; n = 6). However, on adding the AT1 antagonist losartan (1 μm), Ang II stimulated NO production by 0.9 ± 0.1 fluorescence units/min (p < 0.001; n = 5) (Fig. 2). These data suggest that Ang II stimulates TAL NO production via activation of AT2. To investigate whether Ang II stimulates TAL NO production via Akt, we used Akt inhibitor VIII. In isolated TALs, 100 nm Ang II increased NO production by 0.63 ± 0.09 fluorescence units/min (p < 0.002; n = 5). After adding the Akt inhibitor (5 μm), this increase only reached 0.04 ± 0.17 fluorescence units/min (p < 0.017 versus Ang II alone; n = 5) (Fig. 3), representing 93% inhibition. Inhibitor alone did not change basal fluorescence (0.07 ± 0.10 fluorescence units/min; not significant). These data suggest that Ang II stimulates TAL NO production by activating Akt. There are three Akt isoforms. To pinpoint which Akt isoform mediates the effects of Ang II, we investigated the effect of Ang II on Akt1, -2, and -3 phosphorylation. In TAL suspensions, Ang II (100 nm) increased phosphorylation of Akt1 at serine 473 by 0.7 ± 0.2 arbitrary units (a.u.) after 5 min (p < 0.006; n = 6), returning to basal levels after 10 and 15 min of incubation (change: 0.6 ± 0.3 and 0.3 ± 0.4 a.u. for 5 and 10 min; n.s; n = 6) (Fig. 4A). Ang II (100 nm) had no effect on phosphorylation of Akt2 at serine 474 after 5 min (change: 0.3 ± 0.1 a.u., n = 7), but it increased by 1.1 ± 0.4 (p < 0.02; n = 7) and 1.6 ± 0.5 a.u. (p < 0.01; n = 7) after 10 and 15 min, respectively (Fig. 4B). Ang II had no effect on phosphorylation of Akt3 at serine 472 (Fig. 4C) at any time point. Thus, Ang II acutely stimulated phosphorylation of Akt1 at serine 473 after 5 min and Akt2 at serine 474 after 10 and 15 min. Because the time course of phosphorylation of Akt1 most closely matched the action of NO production, we next studied the effect of the Akt inhibitor on Akt1 phosphorylation. Incubation of TALs with the Akt inhibitor (5 μm) alone decreased basal Akt1 phosphorylation from 1 to 0.17 ± 0.02 a. u., an inhibition of 83% (p < 0.004 versus control; n = 4). In the presence of the Atk inhibitor, Ang II (100 nm) for 5 min did not stimulate Akt1 phosphorylation (change: 0.03 ± 0.05 versus inhibitor alone; n = 4) (Fig. 5A). Thus, the Akt inhibitor prevented phosphorylation of Akt1 in the TAL under both basal and stimulated (Ang II) conditions. To identify the signaling cascade upstream of Akt1, we investigated: a) the effect of an AT2 receptor agonist to stimulate Akt1 phosphorylation and b) the ability of the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin to block its effect. Incubation of TAL suspensions for 10 min with the AT2 agonist CGP-42112A (10 nm), increased Akt1 phosphorylation by 0.8 ± 0.3 a.u. (p < 0.02; n = 6). Wortmannin alone significantly reduced basal Akt1 phosphorylation by 0.7 ± 0.2 a.u. (p < 0.01; n = 6). In the presence of wortmannin, the AT2 agonist failed to stimulate Akt1 phosphorylation (change: 0.1 ± 0.2 a.u.; n = 6) (Fig. 5B). Thus, the PI3K inhibitor prevented phosphorylation of Akt1 in the TAL under both basal and stimulated (AT2 agonist) conditions. Next, we examined the effect of dn-Akt1 on Ang II-stimulated NO production. In isolated TALs expressing scrambled DNA, Ang II (100 nm) stimulated NO production by 1.2 ± 0.2 fluorescence units/min (p < 0.002; n = 5); but it was significantly reduced in TALs expressing dn-Akt (0.1 ± 0.2 fluorescence units/min; p < 0.003 versus scrambled; n = 6) (Fig. 6). These data indicate that Ang II stimulates TAL NO production by activating Akt1. To determine whether Ang II stimulates NO production by phosphorylating NOS3, we measured its effect on NOS3 phosphorylation by Western blot. In TAL suspensions, Ang II (100 nm) increased NOS3 phosphorylation at serine 1177 by 1.3 ± 0.3 a.u. after 5 min (p < 0.01; n = 6) and 1.5 ± 0.4 a.u. after 10 min (p < 0.015; n = 6), returning to basal levels by 15 min (change: 0.1 ± 0.5; n.s; n = 6) (Fig. 7A, dark bars). Ang II stimulated NOS3 phosphorylation at serine 633 by 0.5 ± 0.1 a.u. after a 5-min incubation (p < 0.007; n = 6), returning to basal levels at 10 and 15 min (change: 0.3 ± 0.1 a.u. and 0.5 ± 0.2 a.u. for 10 and 15 min; n.s; n = 6) (Fig. 7B, dark bars). These data indicate that Ang II acutely phosphorylates TAL NOS3 at serines 1177 and 633. To ascertain whether Ang II enhances phosphorylation NOS3 at serines 1177 and 633 via Akt activation, we measured the effect of the Akt inhibitor VIII on Ang II-stimulated NOS3 phosphorylation. After adding the Akt inhibitor VIII (5 μm), the ability of Ang II to phosphorylate NOS3 at serine 1177 was blocked (change: 0.2 ± 0.2 and 0.8 ± 0.2 a.u. after 5 and 10 min; n.s; n = 4) (Fig. 7A, light bars). The Akt inhibitor alone significantly reduced NOS3 phosphorylation at serine 1177 by 66 ± 6% (p < 0.002; n = 4). In addition, the ability of Ang II to phosphorylate NOS3 at serine 633 after 5 min was abolished by the Akt inhibitor (change: 0.1 ± 0.2 a.u.) (Fig. 7B, light bars). These data suggest that Ang II acutely enhances NOS3 phosphorylation at serines 1177 and 633 via Akt activation. Additionally, Akt appears to regulate basal phosphorylation of NOS3. We hypothesized that Ang II stimulates TAL NO production by activating AT2 and Akt1, which phosphorylates NOS3 at serine 1177. To test this hypothesis, we first directly measured the effect of Ang II on NO production by the rat TAL and the receptor involved. Using fluorescence microscopy, we found that Ang II stimulated TAL NO production within 4 min after 100 nm Ang II was added to the basolateral bath. In a different set of experiments, 100 nm Ang II stimulated cGMP accumulation in TAL suspensions, about half of the increase caused by 200 μm spermine NONOate. To investigate which angiotensin receptor mediates the effect of Ang II on TAL NO production, we tested the ability of angiotensin receptor antagonists to block the stimulatory effect of Ang II. We found that the AT2 antagonist PD 123319 blocked the ability of Ang II to stimulate TAL NO production, whereas the AT1 antagonist losartan had no effect on Ang II-induced NO. This suggests that Ang II binds AT2 and stimulates NO production. Our conclusion that AT2 receptors mediate the stimulatory effect of Ang II on NO production is in agreement with others. Batenburg et al. (7Batenburg W.W. Garrelds I.M. Bernasconi C.C. Juillerat-Jeanneret L. van Kats J.P. Saxena P.R. Danser A.H. Circulation. 2004; 109: 2296-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) found that activation of AT2 in microarteries (though not in large vessels) stimulated NO production and vasodilatation. Hiyoshi et al. (35Hiyoshi H. Yayama K. Takano M. Okamoto H. Hypertension. 2005; 45: 967-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) reported that in rats with 2-kidney 1-clip hypertension, up-regulation of AT2 resulted in stimulation of Akt1, NOS3 activation, and NO production in the thoracic aorta. Similarly, Yayama et al. (36Yayama K. Hiyoshi H. Imazu D. Okamoto H. Hypertension. 2006; 48: 958-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) reported that in a model of aortic banding, AT2 mediated up-regulation of phosphorylated NOS3, resulting in enhanced cyclic GMP and vasodilatation. In contrast, our data contradict findings from Saito et al. (37Saito S. Hirata Y. Emori T. Imai T. Marumo F. Hypertens Res. 1996; 19: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), showing that in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells, activation of AT1 mediated the stimulatory actions of Ang II on NO production. They are also at odds with data showing that AT1 activation stimulates NO in the macula densa (38Liu R. Persson A.E. Hypertension. 2004; 43: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although the explanation for the disparate results is presently unclear, it could be that activation of AT1, which leads to increased intracellular calcium (38Liu R. Persson A.E. Hypertension. 2004; 43: 649-653C"

We demonstrated using SphK1-null mice (SphK1−/−) the crucial role of SphK1 in suppressing lipopolysaccharide-induced neutrophil oxidant production and sequestration in lungs and mitigating lung inflammatory injury. This effect of SphK1 was independent of the production of sphingosine 1-phosphate, the product of SphK1 activity. The anti-inflammatory effect of SphK1 in the lipopolysaccharide model was mediated through SphK1 interaction with JNK. SphK1 stabilization of JNK in turn inhibited JNK binding to the JNK-interacting protein 3 (JIP3) and thus abrogated the activation of NADPH oxidase and oxidant generation and resultant NF-κB activation.

Ley K. Crit. Care. 2004; 8: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). LPS triggers the local activation of macrophages and neutrophils in the lung interstitium and airways, which release inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, tumor necrosis factor-α, and MIP-2 (macrophage inflammatory protein-2) (2Goodman R.B. Strieter R.M. Martin D.P. Steinberg K.P. Milberg J.A. Maunder R.J. Kunkel S.L. Walz A. Hudson L.D. Martin T.R. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 154: 602-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). These mediators in turn promote neutrophil sequestration by activating endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression (such as ICAM-1) and induce neutrophil transmigration into the interstitium and airspace, where neutrophils propagate inflammation through the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (3Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2002; 4: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS production thus has a pivotal role in mediating increased endothelial permeability and tissue injury (4Frey R.S. Ushio-Fukai M. Malik A. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2009; 11: 791-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar).Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), the product of sphingosine kinase (SphK)-mediated phosphorylation of sphingosine, has been shown to enhance the vascular endothelial barrier through binding of S1P to endothelial differentiation gene family receptors (5McVerry B.J. Peng X. Hassoun P.M. Sammani S. Simon B.A. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2004; 170: 987-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 6Peng X. Hassoun P.M. Sammani S. McVerry B.J. Burne M.J. Rabb H. Pearse D. Tuder R.M. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2004; 169: 1245-1251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SphK is the major kinase that phosphorylates sphingosine to generate S1P, and two isoforms of SphK have been identified, SphK1 and SphK2 (7Oskeritzian C.A. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Pharmacol. Ther. 2007; 115: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). SphK1 is the predominant isoform responsible for the presence of S1P in the circulation (8Venkataraman K. Thangada S. Michaud J. Oo M.L. Ai Y. Lee Y.M. Wu M. Parikh N.S. Khan F. Proia R.L. Hla T. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). SphK1 is believed to act through S1P to modulate LPS-induced activation of MAPK proteins, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and NF-κB in macrophages and inflammatory cascade in neutrophils (9Wu W. Mosteller R.D. Broek D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7359-7369Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Yadav M. Clark L. Schorey J.S. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 44802-44811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, there is a controversy whether generation of S1P and high circulating concentration of S1P after sepsis can alone account for the endothelial barrier protective and anti-inflammatory effects of SIP (12Bhattacharya J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2004; 170: 928-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 13Takabe K. Paugh S.W. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2008; 60: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). This controversy arises in part because the G protein-coupled endothelial differentiation receptors are expected to be fully saturated at the high ambient circulating levels of SIP (13Takabe K. Paugh S.W. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2008; 60: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that SphK1 can function independently of S1P to modulate LPS-induced lung inflammatory injury. We found that SphK1 prevented the LPS-induced neutrophil-endothelial adhesive interaction, neutrophil transmigration, and lung inflammatory injury through a reduction of JNK activation, thus preventing NADPH oxidase activation.We used LPS in these studies to induce tissue inflammation because it has been shown to activate the MAPK JNK pathway (14Arndt P.G.

Lieber J.G. Fessler M.B. Nick J.A. Worthen G.S. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2005; 171: 978-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our data show SphK1 can prevent LPS-induced JNK activation and JNK-mediated NADPH oxidase activation through blocking JNK interaction with the JNK-interacting protein 3 (JIP3). These observations identify a novel SphK1-mediated innate immune mechanism that may provide a crucial therapeutic target against inflammation and injury.DISCUSSIONOur results have identified a novel kinase-independent pathway by which SphK1 modulates LPS-induced inflammation and injury. We showed SphK1 prevents LPS-induced lung inflammatory injury through blocking the binding and recruitment of neutrophils to the vascular endothelium as well as reducing neutrophil adhesion-dependent oxidant production. This anti-inflammatory function of SphK1 is the result of the direct interaction of SphK1 with JNK (as assessed by in vitro assays), which prevented JNK activation through the binding to the protein JIP3.The primary data in support of this conclusion are as follows. (i) LPS stimulation fails to significantly increase S1P production in the plasma, lungs, and neutrophils of both WT and SphK1−/− mice. (ii) SKI, the SphK inhibitor, fails to increase neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells, neutrophil oxidant production, and lung neutrophil sequestration that was seen in the SphK1−/− mice. (iii) Expression of the dominant-negative mutant of SphK1(G82D) (21Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. D'Andrea R.J. Wattenberg B.W. J. Biol.

Natarajan V. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2009; 296: L603-L613Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) prevented the augmented increase in lung vascular permeability seen in SphK1−/− mice in response to LPS. (iv) LPS augments the interaction between JNK and SphK1. (v) SphK1 binding to JNK prevents JNK binding to JIP3 and in turn abrogates the activation of NADPH oxidase and generation of ROS responsible for inflammation.Upon LPS stimulation, JIP3 is known to be recruited to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and recruits MEKK1, which facilitates the activation of JNK. In addition, SphK1 may also be recruited to the membrane after LPS stimulation where it binds TRAF6 (9Wu W. Mosteller R.D. Broek D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7359-7369Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 36Ryu J. Kim H.J. Chang E.J. Huang H. Banno Y. Kim H.H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5840-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). TRAF6 was shown to be associated with TLR4 through MyD88 and interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase (37Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Science. 2003; 300: 1524-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Thus, recruitment of both JNK and SphK1 to the TLR4 complex after LPS stimulation raises the possibility, which we addressed here, that SphK1 functions to suppress JNK activation. We observed that the heightened LPS-induced interaction between SphK1 and JNK neutralizes the inflammatory activity of JNK thus preventing its ability to bind to JIP3.How are our data consistent with the model described in Fig. 9? First, we observed that SphK1 directly interacted with JNK, and this interaction increased on stimulation with LPS. Second, deletion of SphK1 resulted in increased phosphorylation of JNK and increased association of JNK and JIP3 and the activation of JNK signaling. Third, we observed that JNK inhibition significantly reduced the LPS-induced lung neutrophil sequestration seen in the SphK1−/− mice and neutrophil adhesion to SphK1−/− MLVEC. Thus, the mechanism of SphK1 mediated protection against LPS-induced lung inflammation and injury involves SphK1-induced suppression of the interaction of JNK with its activating protein JIP3, which block the JNK signaling cascade.Interestingly, the deletion of SphK1 also resulted in increased activation of NADPH oxidase. These results demonstrate that NADPH oxidase activation occurs downstream of JNK activation. In this context, NADPH oxidase-mediated production of ROS could serve as a positive feedback augmenting the JNK activation and amplifying the inflammation cascade (38Luo J.L. Kamata H. Karin M. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2625-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 39Ventura J.J. Cogswell P. Flavell R.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Davis R.J.

Although it is not clear how JNK regulates NADPH oxidase activation (41Papa S. Bubici C. Zazzeroni F. Pham C.G. Kuntzen C. Knabb J.R. Dean K. Franzoso G.

Neurosignals. 2002; 11: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), our results clearly show that down-regulation of NADPH oxidase activity occurred secondary to the reduced JNK activation. Hence, the ability of SphK1 to sequester JNK and block NADPH oxidase activation plays a pivotal role in dampening LPS-induced inflammation and injury.The two forms of sphingosine kinases (SphKs), SphK1 and SphK2, have received considerable attention because of their poorly understood functions that are distinct from their catalytic function needed for the production of S1P (43Hait N.C.

Studies have demonstrated that plasma S1P generation can decrease the basal endothelial permeability and mitigate the increase in permeability in response to mediators such as platelet-activating factor (49Camerer E. Regard J.B. Cornelissen I. Srinivasan Y. Duong D.N. Palmer D. Pham T.H. Wong J.S. Pappu R. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 1871-1879PubMed Google Scholar). The present data show that SphK1-mediated prevention of inflammation and injury induced by LPS is independent of S1P production because SIP production did not increase as would be expected if S1P is to play a crucial anti-inflammatory role in the present studies. Instead, the interaction of SphK1 with JNK was crucial in the inhibition of JNK activation and thereby in preventing the activation of NADPH oxidase and LPS-induced lung inflammatory injury.The JNK → NADPH oxidase signaling pathway has been linked to activation of transcription factor NF-κB and de novo synthesis of adhesion molecules and chemokines (50Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3593) Google Scholar, 51Chen C.C. Chow M.P. Huang W.C. Lin Y.C. Chang Y.J. Mol.

The activation of this pathway is consistent with our observation of increased expression of ICAM-1 and chemokines MIP-1 and MIP-2 in the SphK1−/− mice.Thus, the present findings have uncovered the potentially important immunomodulatory role of SphK1 that is independent of its catalytic activity. We showed that SphK1-mediated sequestration of JNK could serve as a therapeutic target for the prevention of LPS-induced lung inflammatory injury.

Ley K. Crit. Care. 2004; 8: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). LPS triggers the local activation of macrophages and neutrophils in the lung interstitium and airways, which release inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, tumor necrosis factor-α, and MIP-2 (macrophage inflammatory protein-2) (2Goodman R.B. Strieter R.M. Martin D.P. Steinberg K.P. Milberg J.A. Maunder R.J. Kunkel S.L. Walz A. Hudson L.D. Martin T.R. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 154: 602-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). These mediators in turn promote neutrophil sequestration by activating endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression (such as ICAM-1) and induce neutrophil transmigration into the interstitium and airspace, where neutrophils propagate inflammation through the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (3Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2002; 4: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS production thus has a pivotal role in mediating increased endothelial permeability and tissue injury (4Frey R.S. Ushio-Fukai M. Malik A. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2009; 11: 791-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar).Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), the product of sphingosine kinase (SphK)-mediated phosphorylation of sphingosine, has been shown to enhance the vascular endothelial barrier through binding of S1P to endothelial differentiation gene family receptors (5McVerry B.J.

SphK is the major kinase that phosphorylates sphingosine to generate S1P, and two isoforms of SphK have been identified, SphK1 and SphK2 (7Oskeritzian C.A. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Pharmacol. Ther. 2007; 115: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). SphK1 is the predominant isoform responsible for the presence of S1P in the circulation (8Venkataraman K. Thangada S. Michaud J. Oo M.L. Ai Y. Lee Y.M. Wu M. Parikh N.S. Khan F. Proia R.L. Hla T. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). SphK1 is believed to act through S1P to modulate LPS-induced activation of MAPK proteins, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and NF-κB in macrophages and inflammatory cascade in neutrophils (9Wu W. Mosteller R.D. Broek D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7359-7369Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Yadav M. Clark L. Schorey J.S. J.

However, there is a controversy whether generation of S1P and high circulating concentration of S1P after sepsis can alone account for the endothelial barrier protective and anti-inflammatory effects of SIP (12Bhattacharya J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2004; 170: 928-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 13Takabe K. Paugh S.W. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2008; 60: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). This controversy arises in part because the G protein-coupled endothelial differentiation receptors are expected to be fully saturated at the high ambient circulating levels of SIP (13Takabe K. Paugh S.W. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2008; 60: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that SphK1 can function independently of S1P to modulate LPS-induced lung inflammatory injury. We found that SphK1 prevented the LPS-induced neutrophil-endothelial adhesive interaction, neutrophil transmigration, and lung inflammatory injury through a reduction of JNK activation, thus preventing NADPH oxidase activation.We used LPS in these studies to induce tissue inflammation because it has been shown to activate the MAPK JNK pathway (14Arndt P.G.

Our data show SphK1 can prevent LPS-induced JNK activation and JNK-mediated NADPH oxidase activation through blocking JNK interaction with the JNK-interacting protein 3 (JIP3). These observations identify a novel SphK1-mediated innate immune mechanism that may provide a crucial therapeutic target against inflammation and injury."
https://openalex.org/W2037196594,"Regulation of microtubule dynamics underlies many fundamental cellular mechanisms including cell division, cell motility, and transport. In neurons, microtubules play key roles in cell migration, axon outgrowth, control of axon and synapse growth, and the regulated transport of vesicles and structural components of synapses. Loss of synapse and axon integrity and disruption of axon transport characterize many neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, mutations that specifically alter the assembly or stability of microtubules have been found to directly cause neurodevelopmental defects or neurodegeneration in vertebrates. We report here the characterization of a missense mutation in the C-terminal domain of C. elegans alpha-tubulin, tba-1(ju89), that disrupts motor neuron synapse and axon development. Mutant ju89 animals exhibit reduction in the number and size of neuromuscular synapses, altered locomotion, and defects in axon extension. Although null mutations of tba-1 show a nearly wild-type pattern, similar axon outgrowth defects were observed in animals lacking the beta-tubulin TBB-2. Genetic analysis reveals that tba-1(ju89) affects synapse development independent of its role in axon outgrowth. tba-1(ju89) is an altered function allele that most likely perturbs interactions between TBA-1 and specific microtubule-associated proteins that control microtubule dynamics and transport of components needed for synapse and axon growth."
https://openalex.org/W2049023339,"Construction of plasmids is crucial in modern genetic manipulation. As of now, the common method for constructing plasmids is to digest specific DNA sequences with restriction enzymes and to ligate the resulting DNA fragments with DNA ligase. Another potent method to construct plasmids, known as gap-repair cloning (GRC), is commonly used in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. GRC makes use of the homologous recombination activity that occurs within the yeast cells. Due to its flexible design and efficiency, GRC has been frequently used for constructing plasmids with complex structures as well as genome-wide plasmid collections. Although there have been reports indicating GRC feasibility in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, this species is not commonly used for GRC as systematic studies of reporting GRC efficiency in S. pombe have not been performed till date.We investigated GRC efficiency in S. pombe in this study. We first showed that GRC was feasible in S. pombe by constructing a plasmid that contained the LEU2 auxotrophic marker gene in vivo and showed sufficient efficiency with short homology sequences (>25 bp). No preference was shown for the sequence length from the cut site in the vector plasmid. We next showed that plasmids could be constructed in a proper way using 3 DNA fragments with 70% efficiency without any specific selections being made. The GRC efficiency with 3 DNA fragments was dramatically increased >95% in lig4Delta mutant cell, where non-homologous end joining is deficient. Following this approach, we successfully constructed plasmid vectors with leu1+, ade6+, his5+, and lys1+ markers with the low-copy stable plasmid pDblet as a backbone by applying GRC in S. pombe.We concluded that GRC was sufficiently feasible in S. pombe for genome-wide gene functional analysis as well as for regular plasmid construction. Plasmids with different markers constructed in this research are available from NBRP-yeast (http://yeast.lab.nig.ac.jp/)."
https://openalex.org/W2021816878,"Cell culture-adapted strains of Sindbis virus (SINV) initially attach to cells by the ability to interact with heparan sulfate (HS) through selective mutation for positively charged amino acid (aa) scattered in E2 glycoprotein (W. B. Klimstra, K. D. Ryman, and R. E. Johnston, J. Virol. 72: 7357–7366, 1998). Here we have further confirmed that interaction of E2 protein with HS is crucial for cellular infection of SINV based on the reverse genetic system of XJ-160 virus, a Sindbis-like virus (SINLV). Both SINV YN87448 and SINLV XJ-160 displayed similar infectivity on BHK-21, Vero, or C6/36 cells, but XJ-160 failed to infect mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. The molecular mechanisms underlying the selective infectivity of XJ-160 were approached by substituting the E1, E2, or both genes of XJ-160 with that of YN87448, and the chimeric virus was denominated as XJ-160/E1, XJ-160/E2, or XJ-160/E1E2, respectively. In contrast to the parental XJ-160, all chimeric viruses became infectious to wild-type MEF cells (MEF-wt). While MEF-Ext−/− cells, producing shortened HS chains, were resistant not only to XJ-160, but also to YN87448 as well as the chimeric viruses, indicating that the inability of XJ-160 to infect MEF-wt cells likely due to its incompetent discrimination of cellular HS. Treatment with heparin or HS-degrading enzyme resulted in a substantial decrease in plaque formation by YN87448, XJ-160/E2, and XJ-160/E1E2, but had marginal effect on XJ-160 and XJ-160/E1, suggesting that E2 glycoprotein from YN87448 plays a more important role than does E1 in mediating cellular HS-related cell infection. In addition, the peptide containing 145–150 aa from E2 gene of YN87448 specifically bound to heparin, while the corresponding peptide from the E2 gene of XJ-160 essentially showed no binding to heparin. As a new dataset, these results clearly confirm an essential role of E2 glycoprotein, especially the domain of 145–150 aa, in SINV cellular infection through the interaction with HS."
https://openalex.org/W2013327468,"Background Serine proteases are a major component of viper venoms and are thought to disrupt several distinct elements of the blood coagulation system of envenomed victims. A detailed understanding of the functions of these enzymes is important both for acquiring a fuller understanding of the pathology of envenoming and because these venom proteins have shown potential in treating blood coagulation disorders. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study a novel, highly abundant serine protease, which we have named rhinocerase, has been isolated and characterised from the venom of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros using liquid phase isoelectric focusing and gel filtration. Like many viper venom serine proteases, this enzyme is glycosylated; the estimated molecular mass of the native enzyme is approximately 36kDa, which reduces to 31kDa after deglycosylation. The partial amino acid sequence shows similarity to other viper venom serine proteases, but is clearly distinct from the sequence of the only other sequenced serine protease from Bitis gabonica. Other viper venom serine proteases have been shown to exert distinct biological effects, and our preliminary functional characterization of rhinocerase suggest it to be multifunctional. It is capable of degrading α and β chains of fibrinogen, dissolving plasma clots and of hydrolysing a kallikrein substrate. Conclusions/Significance A novel multifunctional viper venom serine protease has been isolated and characterised. The activities of the enzyme are consistent with the known in vivo effects of Bitis gabonica envenoming, including bleeding disorders, clotting disorders and hypotension. This study will form the basis for future research to understand the mechanisms of serine protease action, and examine the potential for rhinocerase to be used clinically to reduce the risk of human haemostatic disorders such as heart attacks and strokes."
https://openalex.org/W2075411161,"A significant proportion of myocardial infarction (MI) patients undergo complex, coordinated perturbations at the molecular level that may eventually drive the occurrence of ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. Despite advances in the elucidation of key processes implicated in this condition, traditional methods relying on gene expression data and the identification of individual biomarkers in isolation pose major limitations not only for improving prediction power, but also for model interpretability. Mechanisms underlying clinical responses after MI remain elusive and there is no biomarker with the capacity to accurately predict ventricular dysfunction after MI. This calls for the exploration of system-level modeling of ventricular dysfunction in post-MI patients. Within this discovery framework key perturbations and predictive patterns are characterized by the integrated biological activity levels observed in pathways, rather than in individual genes.Here we report an integrative approach to identifying pathways related with ventricular dysfunction post MI with potential prognostic and therapeutic value. We found that a diversity of pathway-level perturbations can be profiled in samples of patients with ventricular dysfunction post MI, most of which represent major reductions of gene expression. Highly perturbed pathways included those implicated in antigen-dependent B-cell activation and the synthesis of leucine. By analyzing patient-specific samples encoded with information derived from highly-perturbed pathways, it is possible to visualize differential prognostic patterns and to perform computational classification of patients with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve above 0.75. We also demonstrate how the integration of the outcomes generated by different pathway-based analysis models may improve ventricular dysfunction prediction performance.This research offers an alternative, comprehensive view of key relationships and perturbations that may trigger the emergence or prevention of ventricular dysfunction post-MI."
https://openalex.org/W2058453819,"Current prophylactic vaccines work via the induction of B and T cell mediated memory that effectively control further replication of the pathogen after entry. In the case of therapeutic or post-exposure vaccinations the situation is far more complex, because the pathogen has time to establish itself in the host, start producing immune-inhibitory molecules and spread into distant organs. So far it is unclear which immune parameters have to be activated in order to thwart an existing lethal infection. Using the mousepox model, we investigated the immunological mechanisms responsible for a successful post-exposure immunization with modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA). In contrast to intranasal application of MVA, we found that intravenous immunization fully protected mice infected with ectromelia virus (ECTV) when applied three days after infection. Intravenous MVA immunization induced strong innate and adaptive immune responses in lethally infected mice. By using various gene-targeted and transgenic mouse strains we show that NK cells, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells and antibodies are essential for the clearance of ECTV after post-exposure immunization. Post-exposure immunization with MVA is an effective measure in a murine model of human smallpox. MVA activates innate and adaptive immune parameters and only a combination thereof is able to purge ECTV from its host. These data not only provide a basis for therapeutic vaccinations in the case of the deliberate release of pathogenic poxviruses but possibly also for the treatment of chronic infections and cancer."

Morphological changes induced by the presence of ParC on PDMS were shown to directly affect liver cell metabolic activity and the expression of transmembrane receptors implicated in cell adhesion and cell-cell interaction. These changes were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), which elucidated differences in HepG2 cell adhesion, spreading, and reorganization into two- or three-dimensional structures by neosynthesis of ECM components. Local modulation of cell aggregation was successfully performed using ParC/PDMS micropatterns constructed by simple microfabrication.We demonstrated for the first time the modulation of HepG2 cells' behavior in relation to the intrinsic physical properties of PDMS and ParC, enabling the local modulation of cell spreading in a 2D or 3D manner by simple microfabrication techniques.

https://openalex.org/W2054531000,"The success of social animals (including ourselves) can be attributed to efficiencies that arise from a division of labour. Many animal societies have a communal nest which certain individuals must leave to perform external tasks, for example foraging or patrolling. Staying at home to care for young or leaving to find food is one of the most fundamental divisions of labour. It is also often a choice between safety and danger. Here we explore the regulation of departures from ant nests. We consider the extreme situation in which no one returns and show experimentally that exiting decisions seem to be governed by fluctuating record signals and ant-ant interactions. A record signal is a new 'high water mark' in the history of a system. An ant exiting the nest only when the record signal reaches a level it has never perceived before could be a very effective mechanism to postpone, until the last possible moment, a potentially fatal decision. We also show that record dynamics may be involved in first exits by individually tagged ants even when their nest mates are allowed to re-enter the nest. So record dynamics may play a role in allocating individuals to tasks, both in emergencies and in everyday life. The dynamics of several complex but purely physical systems are also based on record signals but this is the first time they have been experimentally shown in a biological system."
https://openalex.org/W1988299626,"Background Due to their self-renewal, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are attractive cells for applications in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Although ESC differentiation has been used as a platform for generating bone in vitro and in vivo, the results have been unsatisfactory at best. It is possible that the traditional culture methods, which have been used, are not optimal and that other approaches must be explored. Methodology/Principal Findings ESCs were differentiated into osteoblast lineage using a micro-mass approach. In response to osteogenic differentiation medium, many cells underwent apoptosis, while others left the micro-mass, forming small aggregates in suspension. These aggregates were cultured in three different culture conditions (adhesion, static suspension, and stirred suspension), then examined for osteogenic potential in vitro and in vivo. In adhesion culture, ESCs primed to become osteoblasts recommitted to the adipocyte lineage in vitro. In a static suspension culture, resulting porous aggregates expressed osteoblasts markers and formed bone in vivo via intermembranous ossification. In a stirred suspension culture, resulting non-porous aggregates suppressed osteoblast differentiation in favor of expanding progenitor cells. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrate that microenvironment modulates cell fate and subsequent tissue formation during ESC differentiation. For effective tissue engineering using ESCs, it is important to develop optimized cell culture/differentiation conditions based upon the influence of microenvironment."

Biosci. 2002; 7: 1356-1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Donato R. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2003; 60: 540-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). The primary structure of dicalcin consists of two S100-like regions connected by a linker region, which features this protein as a “dimer form of S100 calcium-binding protein.” Dicalcin was originally identified in frog (Rana catesbeiana) olfactory cilia as an intracellularly expressed Ca2+-binding protein (15Miwa N. Kobayashi M. Takamatsu K. Kawamura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-bound form of dicalcin interacts with several ciliary proteins, including annexins and β-adrenergic receptor kinase-like protein (16Miwa N. Uebi T. Kawamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27245-27249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Uebi T. Miwa N. Kawamura S. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 4863-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Dicalcin shows no enzymatic activities by itself, and instead, through interactions with these intracellular target proteins, it may serve to regulate ciliary function(s) of olfactory neurons such as chemosensory signaling and/or ciliary membrane repair. After the original identification, however, this protein was also found in other tissues, including egg (12Miwa N. Shinmyo Y. Kawamura S. DNA Seq. 2007; 18: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The objectives of this study were to examine whether dicalcin regulates some reproductive functions, including fertilization and to identify molecular mechanisms for the action of dicalcin. We here characterized Xenopus dicalcin in egg and revealed its crucial role in sperm-egg interaction during fertilization. vitelline envelope polyvinylidene difluoride trifluoromethanesulfonic acid bovine serum albumin tetramethylcarboxyrhodamine fluorescent correlation spectroscopy R. communis agglutinin I Coomassie brilliant blue. The coding region of dicalcin was PCR-amplified, ligated with pET-3a (Novagen, EMD, Darmstadt, Germany) and subsequently introduced into E. coli BL21 pLysS (Novagen). Recombinant dicalcin was expressed and purified according to procedures as described previously (15Miwa N. Kobayashi M. Takamatsu K. Kawamura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 45Ca blot analysis was performed as described previously (16Miwa N. Uebi T. Kawamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27245-27249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant dicalcin and molecular size markers (Bio-Rad, ∼6 μg each) were electrophoresed and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Immobilon, Millipore, Billerica, MA). Blots on the membrane were soaked in a Tris-buffered saline (100 mm Tris-HCl, 154 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) under 1 mm 45CaCl2 (5.9 × 1012 Bq/mmol). After blots were washed with 50% methanol and then dried, bound 45Ca was detected with BAS2000 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). To measure the stoichiometry of Ca2+ binding to dicalcin, we performed flow dialysis experiments as previously described (18Miwa N. Shinmyo Y. Kawamura S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6029-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, we incubated dicalcin (final concentration, 10 μm) in a Tris buffer (100 mm KCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) at 20 °C with various concentrations of 45CaCl2 (5.9 × 1012 Bq/mmol). The reaction buffer was placed in a prewashed microconcentrator (Microcon, Millipore) used as a filtration device, and then it was centrifuged briefly. We counted the activities of 45Ca in 4-μl portions of both reaction mixture and the filtrate using a scintillation mixture (Clearzol, Nacalai, Kyoto, Japan). By comparing the activities of 45Ca in the reaction mixture and the filtrate, the amount of Ca2+ bound to dicalcin was calculated. Blank experiments without dicalcin were performed to correct for nonspecific binding of Ca2+ to the membrane of microconcentrators. The Ca2+ concentration in each reaction mixture was varied using a Ca/EGTA buffering system and was calibrated fluorometrically with fluo-3 FF (19David G. Barrett J.N. Barrett E.F. J. Physiol. 1997; 504: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Calbiochem, EMD). A soluble fraction of eggs was obtained by ultracentrifugation (50,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) of the egg homogenate. A portion of the soluble fraction was electrophoresed and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore). After blocking, blots were incubated with dicalcin antibody at 4 °C at a dilution of 1/(2 × 104). Anti-dicalcin antibody against purified recombinant dicalcin was raised in a rabbit. After washing, blots were reacted with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by LAS-1000 (Fujifilm). Anti-dicalcin antibody was immunoaffinity-isolated from an antiserum using dicalcin-Sepharose. Preparation of dicalcin-Sepharose was performed as described previously (16Miwa N. Uebi T. Kawamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27245-27249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Xenopus egg was first dejellied by using 2% cysteine and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde, and 0.1% Triton at 4 °C. Then the egg was immersed in 25% sucrose, embedded in O.C.T. compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetek, Tokyo, Japan), and cut into ∼14-μm-thick sections. The sections were then treated by a standard immunohistochemical procedures in which anti-dicalcin antibody was used at a dilution of 1/(2 × 104) at 4 °C overnight. After the sections were rinsed, they were treated with a secondary antibody (Alexa 568, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). VE proteins were prepared from Xenopus eggs by sieving method described elsewhere (20Wolf D.P. Nishihara T. West D.M. Wyrick R.E. Hedrick J.L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3671-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Richter H.P. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1980; 4: 985-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, envelopes were collected by passing dejellied egg lysate through a nylon screen, and the screen was washed extensively with distilled water. Isolated envelopes were stored overnight in 2 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) to selectively solubilize contaminating yolk platelets (22Lindsay L.L. Hedrick J.L. J. Exp. Zool. 1988; 245: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and heated at 70 °C before use. VE proteins were deglycosylated using trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMS) as described elsewhere (23Lindsay L.L. Hedrick J.L. Dev. Biol. 1989; 135: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, freeze-dried VE proteins were suspended in 100 μl of anhydrous TFMS/anisole (9:1) and kept on ice during 3 h. After this cleavage reaction, 1 ml of pyridine/diethylether (1:9) was added to the reaction mixture in a dry ice/ethanol bath to remove TFMS. Deglycosylated VE proteins were dialyzed against 10 mm NH4HCO3. Blot overlay analysis using biotinylated dicalcin was performed according to our previous method (16Miwa N. Uebi T. Kawamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27245-27249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble egg proteins and VE were electrophoresed and blotted onto a PVDF membrane. Deglycosylated VE proteins were used when indicated. After renaturing and blocking, blots were incubated with biotinylated dicalcin (final concentration, 0.4 μm) overnight at 4 °C in the presence of either 500 μm CaCl2 or 500 μm EGTA. When blots were incubated with Rhodamine-labeled Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCAI), they were preincubated with dicalcin in the presence of either CaCl2 or EGTA. After wash, biotinylated dicalcin bound to a target protein was coupled to horseradish peroxidase using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and visualized by using LAS-1000 (Fujifilm). Bound Rhodamine-labeled RCAI was visualized by using FLA-8000 (Fujifilm). Ovulated or gently squeezed eggs were immediately washed three times with Steinberg solution (58 mm NaCl, 0.6 mm KCl, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Jelly was removed by exposure (5 min) of the eggs to 2% cysteine. The resultant jelly-free eggs were gently washed several times with 0.3×MMR (1×MMR: 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.8). Jelly extract was prepared as described elsewhere (24Heasman J. Holwill S. Wylie C.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 213-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, jelly-coated eggs (∼4g) were subjected to gentle rocking with 10 ml of 0.3×MMR for 60 min. The medium was collected and mixed with Ficoll (final concentration, 10%, Sigma), providing “jelly extract.” Sperm were prepared by chopping and macerating a freshly excised testis in 1 ml of 0.3×MMR. The intact sperm were diluted in the jelly extract. Approximately 40 dejellied eggs in 0.3×MMR of ∼500 μl were preincubated with the following material for 15 min; dicalcin (final concentration, 0.4 μm or 4 μm), BSA (4 μm) as a control, anti-dicalcin antibody (5 or 50 mg/liter), preimmune rabbit IgG (50 mg/liter). After washing eggs gently with 0.3×MMR, sperm suspension of ∼100 μl (final concentration, ∼5 × 106/ml) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min. Then, sperm-treated eggs were gently washed several times with 0.3×MMR. To confirm efficient removal of loosely attached sperm, two-cell embryos were treated in a same manner as controls. Almost no sperm (0–5 sperm/egg) remained attached to the two-cell embryo. The gametes were fixed and stained in 3% paraformaldehyde in 0.3×MMR, and bound sperm were counted in an equatorial focal plane. All count was done blind to conditions. For a quantitative confocal study, the gametes were fixed and stained in 3% paraformaldehyde in 0.3×MMR containing Hoechst 33342 (0.2 mg/ml). Stained sperm were observed using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM510, Oberkochen, Germany) with pinhole aperture, detector gain, and offset being kept constant for experimental comparisons. Intensity of Hoechst staining of each focal plane was summed from three stepwise focal planes having a 50-μm interval to score the total number of bound sperm per egg. All quantifications were done blind to conditions. We used Netwell assembly to assay the efficiency of sperm penetration (NetwellTM, Corning, NY). The upper chamber is assembled from the polystyrene frame insert and the polyester mesh, the mesh size (∼70 μm) of which is proper enough to hold viscous VE proteins and also to allow sperm for free moving. In the lower chamber, 650 μl of 0.3×MMR was filled to contact with the bottom mesh of the upper chamber. Suspension of VE proteins (0.5 mg/ml, ∼650 μl) was placed on the mesh of the upper chamber. After preincubation of VE protein layer either with dicalcin (final concentration, 4 μm) or BSA (4 μm) as a control for 15 min, sperm suspension (∼5 × 106 sperm/well) was added, and the mixture was incubated for the indicated time. Penetrated sperm through the VE to the lower chamber were collected and counted to calculate the percentage of penetrated sperm. All counts were done blind to conditions. Pretreatments were performed similarly as described for the sperm binding assay. After washing gently with 0.3×MMR, dejellied eggs were inseminated with sperm (final concentration, ∼5 × 106/ml) treated with jelly extract. The successful fertilization was scored by counting eggs that underwent first cleavage until some of the fertilized eggs proceeded to the four-cell stage (mostly occurring within ∼120 min after insemination). All counts were done blind to conditions. Lectin blot analyses were performed as described elsewhere (25Ihara S. Miyoshi E. Ko J.H. Murata K. Nakahara S. Honke K. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16960-16967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). VE proteins were electrophoresed and blotted onto a PVDF membrane. Deglycosylated VE proteins were used where indicated. After blocking with synthetic polymer (PVDF Blocking Reagent, TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan), blots were probed with 50 μg/ml lectin conjugates (Rhodamine-RCAI, Fluorescein-soybean agglutinin, Fluorescein-Sambucus nigra lectin, and Biotinylated-MALII, Vector Laboratories). After wash, bound lectin was visualized by using FLA-8000 (Fujifilm) or LAS-1000 using a Vectastain ABC kit similarly as in blot overlay analysis. For lectin cytochemistry, unfertilized eggs were pretreated either with BSA or dicalcin (4 μm each) in 0.3×MMR at room temperature for 15 min. After wash, eggs were treated with Rhodamine-labeled RCAI (50 μg/ml) for 30 min and analyzed using a confocal microscope initially under low detector gain, followed by observation under high detector gain for further analyses. gp41 was isolated under continuously eluted SDS-PAGE using a Mini Prep Cell (Bio-Rad) as previously described elsewhere (8Vo L.H. Hedrick J.L. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 766-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, heat-solubilized VE proteins were loaded onto a PAGE gel, and run with a constant current. Fractions were collected every 10 min with a flow rate of 60 μl/min. Fractions containing gp41 were analyzed by silver staining and pooled. Isolated gp41 was labeled with a fluorescent dye, tetramethylcarboxyrhodamine (TMR) according to the manufacturer's manual (protein labeling kit for the MF20 system, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline. Fluorescent correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements were performed in ∼35 μl of a Tris-buffered saline (100 mm Tris-HCl, 154 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) solution containing TMR-labeled gp41 (10 nm), 200 μm Ca2+ either in the presence (1 μm) or absence of dicalcin (MF20 system, Olympus). Fluorescence intensity was recorded for the duration of 30 s at each measurement with a proper set of excitation light and emission filter, and diffusion time of each sample was calculated five times and averaged. Dejellied eggs were resuspended in 0.3×MMR (∼500 μl) and labeled with 1 μl of Cy5 (final concentration, 1 nmol/ml; diluted from DIGE Fluor minimal dye of the Ettan DIGE system, Amersham Biosciences) on ice for 30 min. After quenching with 10 mm lysine, eggs were washed and VE proteins were isolated as described before. VE proteins were electrophoresed, and a fluorescence image was obtained using the fluorescence scanner (Typhoon 9400, Amersham Biosciences), followed by CBB staining to quantitate the amount of each VE protein. Based on fluorescence intensity, the molar amount of Cy5 coupled with VE protein was scored. Because one molecule of this dye couples with one molecule of protein (manufacturer's manual), we deduced the molar amount of labeled protein and calculated the ratio to total molar amount existing in the preparation for each of four VE proteins. Although the recommended pH for coupling buffer was 8.5 due to labeling efficiency of N-hydroxysuccinimide ester coupling chemistry, our coupling buffer with a pH of 7.5 was found to be also applicable to label VE proteins (supplemental Fig. S1), and therefore we adopted the pH of 7.5 for coupling in our assay as a more physiological condition. All animal experiments were approved and in accordance with the animal care committee's guidelines at Toho University. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. otherwise indicated. The variables between two groups were analyzed using the Student t test. We first examined the protein chemistry of dicalcin for Ca2+ binding (Fig. 1). Our 45Ca blot and flow dialysis experiments showed that dicalcin actually binds to approximately four Ca2+ per molecule maximally (∼3.6 Ca2+/protein at ∼200 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 1B)). This indicates that all four Ca2+-binding motifs called EF-hands are capable of interacting with Ca2+ and implies a potency of Ca2+-dependent function(s) of dicalcin. By using specific antibody against dicalcin (Fig. 2A), we examined localization of dicalcin in a Xenopus egg. The result showed that dicalcin is localized prominently in the marginal region of an egg and throughout the egg to a less extent (Fig. 2B). Higher magnified observation revealed that dicalcin is distributed uniformly in the VE (Fig. 2C, arrowheads). This result is intriguing, because no other S100 proteins have been shown to exist in the extracellular structure such as VE, although several lines of evidence demonstrated extracellular release of some S100 proteins (26Rammes A. Roth J. Goebeler M. Klempt M. Hartmann M. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9496-9502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 27Davey G.E. Murmann P. Heizmann C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30819-30826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, dicalcin is localized in the cytosol within ∼20 μm of depth from the cell surface: this area corresponds to the cortex of an egg (Fig. 2C, arrows), but not in yolk nor pigment granules. The absence of dicalcin within cortical granules suggests that extracellular release of dicalcin after fertilization is unlikely, consistent with our results that there were no significant changes in immunoreactive intensity between unfertilized and fertilized eggs (data not shown). To investigate the physiological role(s) of dicalcin in an egg, we tried to identify the target(s) of dicalcin. Blots of egg-soluble proteins and VE proteins were probed by biotinylated dicalcin either in the presence or absence of Ca2+. Dicalcin bound to several egg and VE proteins in the presence of Ca2+ (middle panels in Fig. 3A, arrowheads), but not in the absence of Ca2+ (right panels in Fig. 3A). In egg extract, two bands at molecular masses of ∼35–38 kDa may represent annexins that have been shown to interact with dicalcin in frog olfactory and respiratory cilia (17Uebi T. Miwa N. Kawamura S. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 4863-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). VE is known to be composed of four major proteins (gp120, gp69/64, gp41, and gp37; asterisks in the left panels in Fig. 3A). A comparison of the molecular masses of the candidates (arrowheads) and silver-stained proteins (asterisks) revealed that dicalcin-binding proteins in the VE are gp41 and gp37. Dicalcin binding to gp41 or gp37 is specific, because dicalcin-binding signals almost disappeared in the presence of purified anti-dicalcin antibody (50 mg/liter) (Fig. 3B). It should be noted that this result also endorses the potential use of this polyclonal antibody to inhibit the interaction between dicalcin and VE proteins in the later in vitro fertilization experiment. Because gp41 and gp37 contain sugar moieties on their protein cores, we examined whether dicalcin binds to their protein cores or glycan portions. VE proteins were chemically deglycosylated using TFMS (right lane in Fig. 3C). TFMS-treated gp41 and gp37 co-migrated on SDS-PAGE at ∼36 kDa as seen in previous research (23Lindsay L.L. Hedrick J.L. Dev. Biol. 1989; 135: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (upper panel, Fig. 3C). The decrease in the apparent molecular mass after deglycosylation was larger in gp41 than in gp37, which is consistent with the notion that gp41 has as much as ∼70% of total glycans in the VE glycoproteins (11Vo L.H. Yen T.Y. Macher B.A. Hedrick J.L. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 1822-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our lectin blot showed that RCAI reacted solely with native gp41 but not with its TFMS-treated, deglycosylated form nor gp37 (middle panel, Fig. 3C). Our blot overlay analysis using deglycosylated VE proteins showed that dicalcin bound to ∼36-kDa proteins (lower panel, Fig. 3C). Accordingly, these results indicate that dicalcin is likely to bind to protein cores of gp41 and gp37. In a currently favored model of Xenopus sperm-egg interaction, acrosome-intact sperm bind to gp41 and gp69/64 and undergo acrosome reaction, which enables sperm to penetrate the VE (28Tian J. Gong H. Thomsen G.H. Lennarz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1099-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Major sperm binding activity has been shown to reside in the complex N-linked oligosaccharides of gp41 (8Vo L.H. Hedrick J.L. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 766-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, a combination of gp37, gp41, and gp69/64 as a whole is suggested to maximize sperm binding, implying that gp37 serves to reinforce sperm binding to VE as an essential structural component of VE filaments (8Vo L.H. Hedrick J.L. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 766-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because dicalcin binds to both gp37 and gp41 in the VE, we hypothesized that dicalcin affects the processes of sperm-egg interaction such as sperm binding to the VE and/or sperm penetration through the VE. To examine this, we first investigated the sperm-egg binding in vitro after preincubation of dejellied eggs either with BSA or anti-dicalcin antibody (50 mg/liter). The antibody slightly increased the number of bound sperm, although the extent is small (∼115% of control, n = 9, p = 0.027) (Fig. 4B). In contrast, preincubation with recombinant dicalcin decreased the number of bound sperm (∼77% of control at 4 μm, n = 9, p = 0.003) (Fig. 4C). In parallel, these findings were confirmed by confocal observations of the intensity of Hoechst-stained sperm bound to an egg (data not shown). Next, to evaluate the effect of dicalcin on penetration through the VE, we developed an in vitro penetration assay method, where sperm were placed on a VE protein layer lying on a polycarbonate filter (pore size, 74 μm) at the bottom of a polystyrene upper chamber (Fig. 4D). At the indicated time of incubation, we counted the number of sperm that penetrated through the VE protein layer and infiltrated the lower chamber. The extent of penetration reached to maximum around 10 min (Fig. 4F). Pretreatment of VE with dicalcin (4 μm) significantly impaired the efficiency of sperm penetration 5 min after placement of sperm (∼50% of control at 4 μm; n = 6, p = 0.039) (Fig. 4G). Based on the above findings, we examined the effect of dicalcin on fertilization in vitro. Preincubation with anti-dicalcin antibody surprisingly increased the efficiency up to ∼208% of control (n = 6, p = 0.0074) (Fig. 5A). Since anti-dicalcin antibody significantly blocked the binding of dicalcin to both gp41 and gp37 (Fig. 3B), preincubation with antibody is likely to neutralize the action of native dicalcin. Oppositely, preincubation with recombinant dicalcin inhibited the efficiency of fertilization in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). In particular, preincubation of dicalcin at a concentration of 4 μm inhibited fertilization almost completely (∼14% of control; n = 6, p = 7.2 × 10−5). Addition of antibody (50 mg/liter) in the presence of 0.4 μm dicalcin cancelled this inhibitory action (+Anti-dica in Fig. 5B). Preincubation of EGTA (16 μm), equivalent to the amount of bound Ca2+ to dicalcin (4 μm), exerted no effect, which indicated that this inhibitory effect is not due to its Ca2+-buffering ability but its action as a protein (EGTA in Fig. 5B). Preincubation of sperm with dicalcin (4 μm) had no effects, indicating that dicalcin acts on an egg, not on sperm (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these results strongly suggested that dicalcin dampens both of sperm binding and sperm penetration, and thereby reduces the efficiency of in vitro fertilization remarkably. What is the molecular mechanism of an inhibitory effect of dicalcin on fertilization shown above? Carbohydrate-dependent recognition is well known to play an important role for establishment of an appropriate sperm-egg interaction. Accordingly, we hypothesized that dicalcin could induce an alteration in the interaction between sperm and VE glycans, thereby affecting the efficiency of fertilization. Interestingly, fertilization-failed human egg"
https://openalex.org/W1980219612,"Background In human Estrogen Receptor α (ERα)-positive breast cancers, 5′ end dense methylation of the estrogen-regulated pS2/TFF1 gene correlates with its transcriptional inhibition. However, in some ERα-rich biopsies, pS2 expression is observed despite the methylation of its TATA-box region. Herein, we investigated the methylation-dependent mechanism of pS2 regulation. Methodology/Principal Findings We observed interplay between Methyl-CpG Binding Domain protein 2 (MBD2) transcriptional repressor and ERα transactivator: (i) the pS2 gene is poised for transcription upon demethylation limited to the enhancer region containing the estrogen responsive element (ERE); (ii) MBD2-binding sites overlapped with the methylation status of the pS2 5′ end; (iii) MBD2 depletion elevated pS2 expression and ectopic expression of ERα partially overcame the inhibitory effect of MBD2 when the ERE is unmethylated. Furthermore, serial chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that MBD2 and ERα could simultaneously occupy the same pS2 DNA molecule; (iv) concomitant ectopic ERα expression and MBD2 depletion resulted in synergistic transcriptional stimulation, while the pS2 promoter remains methylated. Conclusions/Significance MBD2 and ERα drive opposite effects on pS2 expression, which are associated with specific steady state levels of histone H3 acetylation and methylation marks. Thus, epigenetic silencing of pS2 could be dependent on balance of the relative intracellular concentrations of ERα and MBD2."
https://openalex.org/W2003661982,"The purpose of this study is to explore the function of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) during pathological lymphangiogenesis. PAI-1, the main physiological inhibitor of plasminogen activators is involved in pathological angiogenesis at least by controlling extracellular proteolysis and by regulating endothelial cell survival and migration. Protease system's role in lymphangiogenesis is unknown yet. Thus, based on its important pro-angiogenic effect, we hypothesized that PAI-1 may regulate lymphangiogenesis associated at least with metastatic dissemination of cancer cells. To address this issue, we studied the impact of PAI-1 deficiency in various murine models of tumoral lymphangiogenesis. Wild-type PAI-1 proficient mice were used as controls. We provide for the first time evidence that PAI-1 is dispensable for tumoral lymphangiogenesis associated with breast cancers either induced by mammary carcinoma cell injection or spontaneously appearing in transgenic mice expressing the polyomavirus middle T antigen (PymT) under the control of a mouse mammary tumor virus long-terminal repeat promoter (MMTV-LTR). We also investigated inflammation-related lymphatic vessel recruitment by using two inflammatory models. PAI-1 deficiency did neither affect the development of lymphangioma nor burn-induced corneal lymphangiogenesis. These novel data suggest that vascular remodelling associated with lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis involve different molecular determinants. PAI-1 does not appear as a potential therapeutic target to counteract pathological lymphangiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1994884104,"Under conditions of visual fixation, perceptual fading occurs when a stationary object, though present in the world and continually casting light upon the retina, vanishes from visual consciousness. The neural correlates of the consciousness of such an object will presumably modulate in activity with the onset and cessation of perceptual fading. Method In order to localize the neural correlates of perceptual fading, a green disk that had been individually set to be equiluminant with the orange background, was presented in one of the four visual quadrants; Subjects indicated with a button press whether or not the disk was subjectively visible as it perceptually faded in and out. Results Blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal in V1 and ventral retinotopic areas V2v and V3v decreases when the disk subjectively disappears, and increases when it subjectively reappears. This effect occurs in early visual areas both ipsilaterally and contralaterally to the fading figure. That is, it occurs regardless of whether the fading stimulus is presented inside or outside of the corresponding portion of visual field. In addition, we find that the microsaccade rate rises before and after perceptual transitions from not seeing to seeing the disk, and decreases before perceptual transitions from seeing to not seeing the disk. These BOLD signal changes could be driven by a global process that operates across contralateral and ipsilateral visual cortex or by a confounding factor, such as microsaccade rate."
https://openalex.org/W1995300804,"The observation of variation in substitution rates among lineages has led to (1) a general rejection of the molecular clock model, and (2) the suggestion that a number of biological characteristics of organisms can cause rate variation. Accurate estimates of rate variation, and thus accurate inferences regarding the causes of rate variation, depend on accurate estimates of substitution rates. However, theory suggests that even when the substitution process is clock-like, variable numbers of substitutions can occur among lineages because the substitution process is stochastic. Furthermore, substitution rates along lineages can be misestimated, particularly when multiple substitutions occur at some sites. Although these potential causes of error in rate estimation are well understood in theory, such error has not been examined in detail; consequently, empirical studies that estimate rate variation among lineages have been unable to determine whether their results could be impacted by estimation error.To evaluate the extent to which error in rate estimation could erroneously suggest rate variation among lineages, we examined rate variation estimated for datasets simulated under a molecular clock on trees with equal and variable branch lengths. Thus, any apparent rate variation in these datasets reflects error in rate estimation rather than true differences in the underlying substitution process. We observed substantial rate variation among lineages in our simulations; however, we did not observe rate variation when average substitution rates were compared between different clades.Our results confirm previous theoretical work suggesting that observations of among lineage rate variation in empirical data may be due to the stochastic substitution process and error in the estimation of substitution rates, rather than true differences in the underlying substitution process among lineages. However, conclusions regarding rate variation drawn from rates averaged across multiple branches are likely due to real, systematic variation in rates between groups."
https://openalex.org/W2121064232,"Exposure to infectious diseases has an unexpected benefit of inhibiting autoimmune diseases and allergies. This is one of many fundamental fitness tradeoffs associated with immune system architecture. The immune system attacks pathogens, but also may (inappropriately) attack the host. Exposure to pathogens can suppress the deleterious response, at the price of illness and the decay of immunity to previous diseases. This ""hygiene hypothesis"" has been associated with several possible underlying biological mechanisms. This study focuses on physiological constraints that lead to competition for survival between immune system cell types. Competition maintains a relatively constant total number of cells within each niche. The constraint implies that adding cells conferring new immunity requires loss (passive attrition) of some cells conferring previous immunities. We consider passive attrition as a mechanism to prevent the initial proliferation of autoreactive cells, thus preventing autoimmune disease. We see that this protection is a general property of homeostatic regulation and we look specifically at both the IL-15 and IL-7 regulated niches to make quantitative predictions using a mathematical model. This mathematical model yields insight into the dynamics of the ""Hygiene Hypothesis,"" and makes quantitative predictions for experiments testing the ability of passive attrition to suppress immune system disorders. The model also makes a prediction of an anti-correlation between prevalence of immune system disorders and passive attrition rates."
https://openalex.org/W2030656297,"In the genesis of many tissues, a phase of cell proliferation is followed by cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation. The latter two processes overlap: genes involved in the cessation of growth may also be important in triggering differentiation. Though conceptually distinct, they are often causally related and functional interactions between the cell cycle machinery and cell fate control networks are fundamental to coordinate growth and differentiation. A switch from proliferation to differentiation may also be important in the life cycle of single-celled organisms, and genes which arose as regulators of microbial differentiation may be conserved in higher organisms. Studies in microorganisms may thus contribute to understanding the molecular links between cell cycle machinery and the determination of cell fate choice networks.Here we show that in the amoebozoan D. discoideum, an ortholog of the metazoan antiproliferative gene btg controls cell fate, and that this function is dependent on the presence of a second tumor suppressor ortholog, the retinoblastoma-like gene product. Specifically, we find that btg-overexpressing cells preferentially adopt a stalk cell (and, more particularly, an Anterior-Like Cell) fate. No btg-dependent preference for ALC fate is observed in cells in which the retinoblastoma-like gene has been genetically inactivated. Dictyostelium btg is the only example of non-metazoan member of the BTG family characterized so far, suggesting that a genetic interaction between btg and Rb predated the divergence between dictyostelids and metazoa.While the requirement for retinoblastoma function for BTG antiproliferative activity in metazoans is known, an interaction of these genes in the control of cell fate has not been previously documented. Involvement of a single pathway in the control of mutually exclusive processes may have relevant implication in the evolution of multicellularity."
